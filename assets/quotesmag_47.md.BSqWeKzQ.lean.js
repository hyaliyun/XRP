At the time of its construction in the 1960s it was the tallest building in Iran and was considered an iconic part of the Tehran skyline. The building collapsed on 19 January 2017 during a high-rise fire.  History  The Plasco building was built in 1962 by the prominent businessman Habib Elghanian, during a decade of rapid growth in Iran. The building was named after his plastics company. At the time of its construction it was the tallest building in Iran, and was considered an iconic landmark of the Tehran skyline, representing the drive for modernization under the rule of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. After the 1979 Iranian revolution, Habib Elghanian was executed by the new government, which seized the building and handed ownership of it to the state-controlled Islamic Revolution Mostazafan Foundation, tied to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. The Mostazafan Foundation operated the building until its collapse. At the time of the fire, the Plasco building was used as a residential and commercial building, with a major shopping center on its ground floor, a restaurant on its upper floor, and several clothing workshops.  Fire and collapse  On 19 January 2017, a fire started on the ninth floor at around 07:50 local time (04:20 GMT). The building was occupied at the time by its residents, workers at the garment shops, and various tour groups that were being shown around the building. Ten fire brigades arrived to fight the blaze. The combined brigades had been trying to stop the fire for hours‚Äîwhile assuring that the building had been evacuated‚Äîwhen the building's north wall collapsed without warning, leading to the collapse of the rest of the building a few moments later. The collapse was captured on camera by Iran's state-run Press TV, which was filming the firefighting efforts. Several firefighters were in the building when the north wall fell, some of whom safely escaped before the building completely collapsed. A number had been fighting the fire from elevated aerial platforms that toppled over during the collapse of the building. Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, the mayor of Tehran, said he believed that no other civilians were within the building when it collapsed, but eyewitnesses reported seeing residents crossing police lines to try to enter the building and recover their possessions. Twenty firefighters have been reported to be killed. At least 70 others were injured by the collapse, with 23 taken to local hospitals having suffered severe injuries. The building primarily collapsed vertically, causing minimal damage to neighboring buildings. The remains of 15 firefighters were recovered after nine days of relief and rescue operations, which were aided by the local military. Tens of thousands of Iranians, including firefighters and senior officials, attended the funeral ceremony held at Tehran's Grand Mosalla. They were laid to rest in part of the Behesht-e Zahra cemetery that is reserved for martyrs. Iranian Leader Ayatollah Khamenei eulogized the firefighters in a message, calling them heroes and shaheeds. Following the building's collapse, its owner, the Mostazafan Foundation, declined to make a public statement. Four days later, on 23 January 2017 the foundation apologized for their role in the possible failure in building's safety, but added that they are not a member of building's board who is responsible for the building's affairs. Mohammad Saeedikia, CEO of Mostazafan Foundation also said that the organization is ready to rebuild the Plasco in two years. In April 2017 the government issued a report on the collapse of the building which stated that the Mostazafan Foundation had ignored warnings given by the authorities. The report also stated that government ministries had failed to enforce 22 national building regulations.

His fabricated military record included twenty years in the Parachute Regiment, fighting with the 2nd Battalion in the Falklands War, serving five tours of duty in Northern Ireland, receiving the Military Medal and reaching the rank of Colour Sergeant. He has worked as a historian, author, consultant, lecturer and battlefield tour guide on the basis of his alleged military experience.  Career  Jack Livesey served as a chef in the Army Catering Corps from 1971 until 1974, when he was discharged following a mental breakdown. Livesey was featured as a military historian in the documentary Death and Destruction in the Falaise Gap and on the History Channel series Battlefield Detectives. He worked as a historical adviser on the 2005 BBC documentary series D-Day to Berlin and the 2006 movie Flyboys. He claimed to have also advised production crews, uncredited, on the miniseries Band of Brothers and the movie Saving Private Ryan. Livesey authored books of military non-fiction, three which were co-written by George Forty, a well- known author and a former curator of the Tank Museum. Livesey worked at the Imperial War Museum Duxford for seven years, first as a volunteer and later as a collections assistant, until he resigned in 2006.  Criminal convictions  In 2004 Jack Livesey was convicted of benefit fraud for receiving nearly ¬£30,000 in incapacity benefit while he was employed at the Imperial War Museum. He was sentenced to a suspended twelve-month jail term due to his supposed military service, and character references submitted by veterans including Air Commodore Peter Thorne and Major Gordon Corrigan, who knew Livesey and believed him to be a war hero. Livesey was exposed as an impostor when investigations following his conviction found that the references submitted by the veterans were based on false claims that Livesey had made to them. He was subsequently charged with perverting the course of justice by police, and admitted to lying about his army career, but denied he was aware the references were submitted. His partner, Bridget Pollard, testified that she had compiled the references. In mitigation, Livesey's attorney stated that his client had been diagnosed with dependent and histrionic personality disorder, and argued these disorders impaired his client's ability to tell fact from fiction. Livesey was found guilty, sentenced to three years in jail and was ordered to pay ¬£3,500 in prosecution costs. He filed on appeal on the grounds that his sentence was excessive. The appeal was denied.

The ISIL siege of the city lasted for almost 3 years and 2 months, after which the Syrian Army launched a successful offensive that fully recaptured the city nine weeks later. In April 2014, ISIL launched a large-scale offensive against Syrian rebel forces in Deir ez-Zor province. This resulted in the total defeat of rebel groups in the area, and ISIL gained control of almost all of Deir ez-Zor Governorate in July 2014. Syrian Government forces remained besieged in the pocket of territory they continued to control. On 10 September 2017, the siege was fully broken by Government forces. After another two months of fighting, the Syrian Army fully recaptured the ISIL-held parts of Deir ez-Zor city and its environs, by 17 November 2017.  Background  Since the end of 2013, rebel forces surrounded Deir ez-Zor and captured half of the city and almost the entire province. ISIL became increasingly involved in the battle. The following rebel infighting in and near the city resulted in ISIL retreating from Deir ez-Zor in February 2014. In April 2014, following their defeat at the hands of the rebels, ISIL returned and launched a large-scale offensive against the Syrian rebel groups in the Deir ez-Zor Province, expelling them from the area, and allowing ISIL to gain control of most of the Deir ez-Zor Governorate and besiege the remaining Syrian Government forces, in July 2014.  The siege   2014: Offensives and counter-offensives  Map showing the beginning of the siege, July 2014 From early to mid-September 2014, ISIL made several unsuccessful attempts to breach the Deir ez-Zor military air base. During the fighting on 15 September 2014, the Siasiyya Bridge that links the rural countryside and the city was destroyed. It was unclear who destroyed it. In late October 2014, the Army launched an offensive on the Sakr Island and within days made several advances, capturing 90 percent of the island, with ISIL forces left in control of only its northern part. One month later, the Army resumed its offensive on the island. In early December 2014, ISIL launched an offensive in the direction of the Deir ez-Zor military air base. During three days of fighting, 68‚Äì200 militants and 43‚Äì51 soldiers were reported killed. Despite ISIL managing to penetrate the air base, as well as seize the mountain overlooking the city and two nearby villages, the Army eventually pushed ISIL's forces back and repelled the offensive.  2015: The siege continues  On 5 January 2015, ISIL closed all roads, and cut all optical fiber cables and other electric wires and cables leading to government-held districts of Deir ez-Zor. By May 2015, fierce back-and-forth fighting raged in the city, with the Syrian Army and ISIL launching a series of attacks and counterattacks against each other. Early that month, ISIL forces captured Sakr Island. Two weeks later, the Syrian Army claimed that it was able to recapture most of it. However, it was confirmed that the island was still under ISIL control. At this point, due to ISIL's capture of the city of Palmyra, rumors started circulating that Syrian Government forces were preparing to abandon Deir ez- Zor. In September 2015, ISIL started regularly to shell the airbase, severing the air bridge that had supplied the city with food and other goods.Pivotal point in eastern Syria as Assad breaks key Islamic State siege In early November 2015, a new ISIL attack on the airbase was repelled.  2016: ISIL advances  On 16 January 2016, ISIL launched an offensive on Deir ez-Zor. Several assaults were conducted during the day, which included six ISIL suicide bombers in attempts to break into military positions. After a few days of heavy fighting, ISIL overran the Baghiliya and Ayyash neighborhoods, after which pro-government fighters and their families were among those targeted in the seized areas. The Syrian government and state media said that 250‚Äì300 people were killed, including some by beheading; the British-based SOHR had differing numbers, reporting 135 fatalities, of which 85 were civilians and 50 soldiers. ISIL also captured an Army weapons depot and seized tanks. SOHR added that ISIL kidnapped about 400 civilians from families of pro-government fighters. Subsequently, ISIL forces captured areas south and west of Baghiliya. Overall, according to SOHR, about 440 people were killed in the five-day ISIL offensive, including: 200 soldiers, 110 ISIL fighters and 127 civilians. 30 of the ISIL militants were suicide-bombers, while 85 civilians and 48 soldiers were executed by ISIL. 42 civilians died in government air- strikes and shelling. In mid-March 2016, the Army launched an attack toward the Thayyem Oil Fields, south of Deir ez-Zor. On the first day of their assault, government forces captured Tharda Mountain. After four days of fighting, the military managed to capture the oil fields. Between April and May 2016, back-and-forth fighting took place as ISIL attempted to advance against government troops in the Industrial and al-Sina'ah districts of Deir ez-Zor city. The Army eventually managed to retain their positions. In June 2016, Hezbollah sent elite reinforcements to help protect the provincial capital of Deir Ezzor. Later on the same month, the Thayyem Oil Fields were once again under ISIL control and the militants were positioned alongside the government-held Tharda Mountain. Late that month, a two-day long ISIL attack on the mountain was repelled. In July 2016, heavy Russian air-strikes against ISIL managed to relieve the pressure on Syrian Army troops stationed on the mountain. On 17 September 2016, a series of 37 U.S.-led Coalition airstrikes near the Deir ez-Zor Airport, lasting from 3:55 to 4:56 p.m. (Damascus time), killed between 90 and 106 Syrian Army soldiers and wounded 110 more. The attack triggered \\"a diplomatic firestorm\\" with Russia calling a (then rare) emergency United Nations Security Council meeting as well as leading to the Syrian government calling off a nationwide ceasefire that had been the result of months of intense diplomatic efforts by the U.S. and Russian governments. The Syrian Army positions that were struck were on the Tharda Mountain and at a nearby artillery base. The airstrikes led to ISIL capturing the Tharda Mountain. Initially, the US Armed Forces did not outright admit that Coalition planes hit Syrian troops, but later the Coalition admitted their planes carried out the attack. The US stated that they halted the strikes as soon as they became aware of the Syrian Army's presence and regretted the unintentional loss of life.  2017: New assaults on besieged areas  In mid-January 2017, a new ISIL offensive was launched with the aim to cut the road between Deir ez-Zor Airport and the city. After two days of fighting, ISIL succeeded in cutting the road linking the air base to the city, leaving the government enclave split in two. During their advances, ISIL captured multiple positions, including the Sakan al-Jahiziya neighborhood on the highway between the city and Damascus, and a strategic mountain overlooking the city. Back-and-forth fighting continued for one month with the Army unsuccessfully attempting to reopen the supply line between the airport and the city. The clashes left more than 470 dead, including: 241 ISIL militants, 127 soldiers and 105 civilians.ÿ£ŸÉÿ´ÿ± ŸÖŸÜ 470 ŸÖÿØŸÜŸä ŸàÿπŸÜÿµÿ± ÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿ¥ŸáÿØŸàÿß ŸàŸÇÿ™ŸÑŸàÿß ÿÆŸÑÿßŸÑ ÿ£ŸàŸÑ ÿ¥Ÿáÿ± ŸÖŸÜ ÿßŸÑŸáÿ¨ŸàŸÖ ÿßŸÑÿ£ÿπŸÜŸÅ ÿπŸÑŸâ ÿØŸäÿ± ÿßŸÑÿ≤Ÿàÿ± ŸàŸÇŸàÿßÿ™ ÿßŸÑŸÜÿ∏ÿßŸÖ ÿ™ŸÅÿ¥ŸÑ ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑÿ™ŸÇÿØŸÖ ŸàŸÅŸÉ ÿßŸÑÿ≠ÿµÿßÿ±ŸäŸÜ ÿπŸÜŸáÿß As the siege of Deir ez-Zor intensified, fears rose that ISIL would commit a large massacre if it ever captured the city. ISIL attempts to breach the Army defenses of the Deir ez-Zor Airport continued well into March 2017. Also, late that month, ISIL conducted a tank assault on the government-held Al-Fourat university, located on the N7 Highway leading to the provincial capital. The same day, ISIL seized a large amount of ammunition and weapons that was intended for the Syrian Army but miss-dropped into ISIL territory by the Russian Air Force. In early April, the Syrian Army made multiple attempts to reopen the supply line between the city and the airport. The fighting was primarily concentrated on the Cemetery Area. Towards the end of May, Army forces were still staving off attacks by ISIL fighters, while 100,000 civilians were surrounded and living without adequate food, services or safety. The UN's World Food Programme, in conjunction with the Syrian government and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, regularly airdropped food and aid to the encircled pockets. Frequent fighting was also taking place in the Cemetery Area. On 3 June, ISIL advanced near Deir ez-Zor. Heavy fighting continued the next day for control of two hilltops at the southern entrance to the city. On 5 June, ISIL managed to capture one of the hills, but were forced to withdraw due to heavy airstrikes. Later that night, a new ISIL attack against the Panorama roundabout was launched that was preceded by a suicide car-bomber. ISIL managed to capture several checkpoints near the roundabout, forcing Army units to withdraw to their second line of defense. ISIL attacks against the two hills also continued, but without any gains. The following evening, ISIL made another push but were repelled. Between 9 and 13 June, ISIL conducted waves of attacks on a daily basis, which were ultimately all repelled. Between 7 and 11 July, a new series of ISIL attacks on Syrian Army positions around the city were repelled. One week later, Syrian Army troops themselves conducted attacks against ISIL positions. At the end of the month, another ISIL attack on Army positions was repelled. At the start of August, after managing to capture a 280 meter long ditch, the Army managed to impose fire-control over ISIL's supply line leading from Tharda Mountain through the Cemetery Area into ISIL-held suburbs of the city. This was followed by several new unsuccessful attempts by ISIL to breach Army lines between 6 and 12 August.  Summer 2017: Breaking the siege  During May and June 2017, the Syrian Arab Army established control over most of the southern part of Raqqa province, as well as the Eastern Qalamun mountains. In mid-July, Syrian forces launched a campaign in Central Syria targeting ISIL strongholds in the provinces of Homs and Hama. On 27 August, the Army launched a major offensive along the Sukhnah-Deir ez-Zor highway. The next day, the Army, with the help of Russian air strikes, came within 66 kilometers of the surrounded city. In the morning of 29 August, the Syrian forces launched a surprise attack in the western part of Deir ez-Zor, targeting ISIL's positions in the strategic Panorama area. On 31 August, the Syrian Arab Army established full control over the strategic mountain of Bishiri, west of Deir ez-Zor city. The offensive was accompanied by Russian air strikes on ISIL positions. Syrian and Russian aviation carried out a joint air attack on an ISIL command center in the al-Rashdiyah district of Deir Ezzor. By 31 August, the Syrian Army, headed by elite Tiger Forces, had advanced to within 50 kilometers of Deir ez-Zor from Sukhna in the east. During the first days of September 2017, the Syrian Army and its allies had reached the 137th Brigade base and were battling to reach the troops besieged inside. It was later reported that they had come within of reaching the nearest Army positions around the base. The siege was broken on 5 September 2017, at around 14:00 local time, when government forces met with elements of the 137th Brigade. The Deir ez-Zor airport continued to be besieged until it was relieved four days later, on 9 September.Syrian army, allies reach airbase besieged by Islamic State in eastern Syria: commander The breaking of the ISIL siege of the city was met with scenes of celebration as civilians exchanged congratulations and fired celebratory gunshots into the air. According to one resident, people would \\"prefer the regime over Daesh\\" in the hopes that breaking of the siege could mean the gradual return of life to Deir ez-Zor, and along with it basic supplies.Regime ‚Äòbreaks‚Äô three-year Islamic State siege of Deir e-Zor city: SAA source  Aftermath ‚Äì Battle for Deir ez-Zor city  On 14 September 2017, the Syrian Army launched an offensive to recapture the remaining ISIL-held districts of Deir ez-Zor city, capturing the district of Al-Baghiliyah. On 17 October, the Syrian Army secured a perimeter surrounding the ISIL-controlled half of the city, encircling the remaining ISIL forces in eastern Deir ez-Zor. Subsequently, the Syrian Army launched an operation to recapture the entire city from ISIL. On 3 November 2017, the Syrian Army fully recaptured Deir ez-Zor city and its surroundings from ISIL. On 17 November, Syrian Government forces captured Hawijat Kati Island, to the north of Deir ez-Zor city, fully bringing the rest of Deir ez-Zor and its outskirts under their control.After an undisclosed agreement, the regime forces imposes their control over Hwyjet Katea‚Äô and tens of ISIS members surrender, the fate of about 150 civilians in it is unknown  Impact on civilians  During the siege, ISIL cut off the power supply to the city. In February 2016, around 200,000 people resided in Deir ez-Zor. The siege resulted in widespread malnutrition and starvation of the civilians in the city. In response, the United Nations' World Food Programme has conducted 177 airdrops of food and other humanitarian aid to the besieged districts of the city since April 2016. 110,000‚Äì120,000 civilians remained as of January 2017, when an ISIL offensive on the airport forced the airdrops to be suspended. In November 2017, the UN estimated that at the start of the siege, around 200,000 civilians were besieged in the Syrian Government-held districts of Deir ez-Zor, which decreased to 90,000 near the end of the siege, with most of those civilians escaping or being smuggled out of the city during ISIL's siege. As a result of the cut in electricity, only one electric generator- powered water pump was available, and the water was not treated.

The shift from traditional to digital banking has been gradual and remains ongoing, and is constituted by differing degrees of banking service digitization. Digital banking involves high levels of process automation and web-based services and may include APIs enabling cross-institutional service composition to deliver banking products and provide transactions. It provides the ability for users to access financial data through desktop, mobile and ATM services. Description A digital bank represents a virtual process that includes online banking and beyond. As an end-to-end platform, digital banking must encompass the front end that consumers see, the back end that bankers see through their servers and admin control panels and the middleware that connects these nodes. Ultimately, a digital bank should facilitate all functional levels of banking on all service delivery platforms. In other words, it should have all the same functions as a head office, branch office, online service, bank cards, ATM and point of sale machines. The reason digital banking is more than just a mobile or online platform is that it includes middleware solutions. Middleware is software that bridges operating systems or databases with other applications. Financial industry departments such as risk management, product development and marketing must also be included in the middle and back end to truly be considered a complete digital bank. Financial institutions must be at the forefront of the latest technology to ensure security and compliance with government regulations. History of Digital Banking The earliest forms of digital banking trace back to the advent of ATMs and cards launched in the 1960s. As the internet emerged in the 1980s with early broadband, digital networks began to connect retailers with suppliers and consumers to develop needs for early online catalogues and inventory software systems. By the 1990s the Internet became widely available and online banking started becoming the norm. The improvement of broadband and ecommerce systems in the early 2000s led to what resembled the modern digital banking world today. The proliferation of smartphones through the next decade opened the door for transactions on the go beyond ATM machines. Over 60% of consumers now use their smartphones as the preferred method for digital banking. The challenge for banks is now to facilitate demands that connect vendors with money through channels determined by the consumer. This dynamic shapes the basis of customer satisfaction, which can be nurtured with Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software. Therefore, CRM must be integrated into a digital banking system, since it provides means for banks to directly communicate with their customers. There is a demand for end-to-end consistency and for services, optimized on convenience and user experience. The market provides cross platform front ends, enabling purchase decisions based on available technology such as mobile devices, with a desktop or Smart TV at home. In order for banks to meet consumer demands, they need to keep focusing on improving digital technology that provides agility, scalability and efficiency. What digital banking means for banks A study conducted in 2015 revealed that 47% of bankers see potential to improve customer relationship through digital banking, 44% see it as a means to generate competitive advantage, 32% as a channel for new customer acquisition. Only 16% emphasized the potential for cost saving. Major benefits of digital banking are: * Business efficiency - Not only do digital platforms improve interaction with customers and deliver their needs more quickly, they also provide methods for making internal functions more efficient. While banks have been at the forefront of digital technology at the consumer end for decades, they have not completely embraced all the benefits of middleware to accelerate productivity. * Cost savings - One of the keys for banks to cut costs is automated applications that replace redundant manual labor. Traditional bank processing is costly, slow and prone to human error, according to McKinsey & Company. Relying on people and paper also takes up office space, which runs up energy and storage costs. Digital platforms can future reduce costs through the synergies of more qualitative data and faster response to market changes. * Increased accuracy - Traditional banks that rely mainly on paper processing can have an error rate of up to 40%, which requires reworking. Coupled with lack of IT integration between branch and back office personnel, this problem reduces business efficiency. By simplifying the verification process, it's easier to implement IT solutions with business software, leading to more accurate accounting. Financial accuracy is crucial for banks to comply with government regulations. * Improved competitiveness - Digital solutions help manage marketing lists, allowing banks to reach broader markets and build closer relationships with tech savvy consumers. CRM platforms can track customer history and provide quick access to email and other forms of online communication. It's effective for executing customer rewards programs that can improve loyalty and satisfaction. * Greater agility - The use of automation can speed up both external and internal processes, both of which can improve customer satisfaction. Following the collapse of financial markets in 2008, an increased emphasis was placed on risk management. Instead of banks hiring and training risk management professionals, it's possible for risk management software to detect and respond to market changes more quickly than even seasoned professionals. * Enhanced security - All businesses big or small face a growing number of cyber threats that can damage reputations. In February 2016 the Internal Revenue Service announced it had been hacked the previous year, as did several big tech companies. Banks can benefit from extra layers of security to protect data. Back End Banking Architecture A key in which digital banks can gain a significant competitive edge is developing a more robust IT architecture. By replacing manual back-office procedures with automated software solutions, banks can reduce employee errors and speed up processes. This paradigm shift can lead to smaller operational units and allow managers to concentrate on improving tasks that require human intervention. Automation reduces the need for paper, which inevitably ends up taking up space that can be occupied with technology. By using software that accelerates productivity up to 50%, banks can improve customer service since they will be able to resolve issues at a faster pace. One way a bank can improve its back end business efficiency is to divide hundreds of processes into three categories: * full automated * partially automated * manual tasks It still isn't practical to automate all operations for many financial firms, especially those that conduct financial reviews or provide investment advice. But the more a bank can replace cumbersome redundant manual tasks with automation, the more it can focus on issues that involve direct communication with customers. The obstacles currently preventing banks from investing in a more digital back end environment are: * banks have traditionally prioritized launching new products that are still difficult to automate * mergers and acquisitions, new products and government regulations have already established complex IT architecture difficult to revise * IT teams do not always grasp business priorities * many banks lack the in-house IT expertise beyond traditional mainframe environments Direction Toward Digital Cash Digital cash eliminates many problems associated with physical cash, such as misplacement or the potential for money to be stolen or damaged. Additionally, digital cash can be traced and accounted for more accurately in cases of disputes. As consumers find an increasing number of purchasing opportunities at their fingertips, there is less need to carry physical cash in their wallets. Other indications that demand for digital cash is growing are highlighted by the use of peer-to-peer payment systems such as PayPal and the rise of untraceable cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. Almost anything imaginable that can be paid with physical cash can theoretically be paid with the swipe of a bank card, including parking meters. The problem is this technology is still not omnipresent. Cash circulation grew in the United States by 42% between 2007 and 2012, with an average annual growth rate of 7%, according to the BBC. The concept of an all digital cash economy is no longer just a futuristic dream but it's still unlikely to outdate physical cash in the near future. All digital banks are possible as a consumer option, but people may still have a need for physical cash in certain situations. ATMs help banks cut overhead, especially if they are available at various strategic locations beyond branch offices. Emerging Digital Solutions Emerging forms of digital banking are * BaaS - Banking as a Service (allows for third party integration) * BaaP - Banking as a Platform (for integrating core systems with software) * Cloud-based Infrastructure (allows less reliance on IT staff) * White Label Banking (such as co-branded credit cards) These solutions build on enhanced technical architectures as well as different business models. Future of Digital Banking The decision for banks to add more digital solutions at all operational levels will have a major impact on their financial stability. While not all banks are in a position to make quick changes to IT infrastructure or the architecture on top of it, banks aiming to be disrupters can move toward broad end-to-end automation can do so over about a six-month time frame.

From 1923 until his death in 1961 he was chairman of the Dutch Anthroposophical Society. He was a familiar figure in public life and had a considerable influence on the anthroposophic movement, particularly through his numerous lectures and his work as an author, which included the first biography of Rudolf Steiner.  Life  Frederik Willem Zeylmans van Emmichoven was the son of a Dutch chocolate manufacturer. His mother came from Germany.Koninklijke Cacao Fabriek HelmondA.H. Huussen jr.; F.W. Zeijlmans van Emmichoven; Historici.nlBiografie van Zeylmans van Emmichoven In childhood he was often troubled by visions of colour and emotional turmoil that later stimulated his preoccupation with colour. After recovering from an attack of typhoid, he entered medical school at eighteen, specialising in psychiatry. His interest in colour, inspired by the painter Jacoba van Heemskerck and her friend and patron Marie Tak van Poortvliet,A.H. Huussen jr., 'Tak van Poortvliet, Joanna Maria (Marie) (1871-1936)', in: Biografisch Woordenboek van Nederland 2 (1985) led him to research the effects of colours on the life of feeling. He continued his medical studies in Leipzig under Wilhelm Wundt in 1919, where he became a member of the Anthroposophical Society. After meeting with Rudolf Steiner, the latter encouraged his further research into the effect of colours and his dissertation he wrote on The effect of colors on the feeling‚Äô‚Äô.Zeylmans van Emmichoven, F.W.; ‚Äò‚Äò‚ÄûDe werking van de kleuren op het gevoel.‚Äú; Utrecht 1923‚Äò‚Äò On 27 September 1921 he was married to Ingeborg Droogleever Fortuyn, whom he had met for the first time many years earlier. Their first son was born in 1926. .Ita Wegman Institut retrieved 18.01.2017 At the age of 28, Zeylmans began lecturing on Anthroposophy to an interested public and academic colleagues. He helped establish the first Waldorf School in The Hague, where he also founded a small psychiatric hospital, which soon moved into its own building (now the Rudolf Steiner Zorg). When the Anthroposophical Society was founded in the Netherlands, Rudolf Steiner appointed him as its first General Secretary. In addition to his psychiatric work Zeylmans undertook worldwide lecture tours. He spoke often about the effect of color on humans and gave advice to paint manufacturers, architects, directors of museums and artists.F.W. Zeylmans van Emmichoven; Kleine Farbenfibel f√ºr ein Tapeten-Musterbuch Zeylman‚Äôs primary concerns were the rapprochement and understanding between the different nations and peoples themselves, as well as a furtherance of cosmopolitanism. His attempt to found the global schools association suggested by Rudolf Steiner (a '‚ÄùWeltschulverein‚Äù), to promote the dissemination and free funding for free school education, failed due mainly to resistance from anthroposophic circles against fostering broader public awareness. In the face of increasing political fanaticism, another initiative Zeylmans took was to further interest for anthroposophy in European youth. In the summer of 1930 he organized a youth camp on the Stakenberg near Nunspeet in the Veluwe. More than a thousand participants gathered in working groups and heard lectures by leading anthroposophists like Eugen Kolisko, Walter Johannes Stein, Elisabeth Vreede and Ita Wegman on their thoughts to the situation of the time. His work, however, was increasingly restricted by political developments. His involvement with the administration of the General Anthroposophical Society in Dornach Switzerland also met with increasing disapproval. The internal disputes since the death of Rudolf Steiner and his close collaboration with the physician Ita Wegman in 1935 led to his exclusion and that of the majority of the Dutch members. After the war Zeylmans took up once again his international lecturing work. In 1954 he embarked on a global tour for nine months. Encouraged by Bernard Lievegoed, in 1960 he sought a mandate from the members of the Anthroposophical Society in the Netherlands to reunite it once more, after 25 years of separation, with the General Anthroposophical Society at the Goetheanum in Switzerland. He undertook a second journey through South Africa in 1961, visiting the newly established Waldorf schools and other institutions to give advice and hold lectures. During this trip, he died unexpectedly in Cape Town.

The early influences of Tatum, Powell, Monk, plus the melodic lines of Tommy Flanagan, the pentatonic harmony of McCoy Tyner, and the rhythmic fluidity of Herbie Hancock have all been thoroughly absorbed by Barron.\\" On Chicago Tribune critic Howard Reich wrote: \\"Though admired among connoisseurs, pianist Kenny Barron never has attained the acclaim he deserves. Perhaps his playing is a bit too subtle and introverted to reach a wide public, or perhaps his timing was off, since he arrived on the scene after the great legends of the '40s and '50s but before the young lions of the '80s. In any event, his name still signals first-rate pianism, as his recent release, \\"Wanton Spirit,\\" proves.\\" On The Los Angeles Times, reviewer Bill Kohlhaase stated: \\" \\"Wanton Spirit\\" makes up for Barron's near-miss recordings of the last few years while painting a more honest picture of his skills.

Originally launched in 1992, it was the idea of The Rolling Stones's musician Mick Jagger and Tim Renton MP, the at the time Minister of State for the Arts, it ran until 1997. After an unofficial hiatus Music Day UK was formed and is the organisation that has been coordinating UK events since 2012. The concept of an all-day musical celebration on the day of the solstice was originated in 1982 by the French Minister of Culture, Jack Lang and France continues it under its original name of F√™te de la Musique. It was this event that inspired the UK incarnation.  Origins  The British National Music Day was the idea of The Rolling Stones's musician Mick Jagger and Tim Renton MP, the at the time Minister of State for the Arts, and launched on 12 February 1992 at a press conference at the Royal Festival Hall, in London, with event Chairman Harvey Goldsmith and Jagger. The first event took place on 28 June 1992, with a programme of more than 1,500 events across the United Kingdom. The first event was supported by the Musicians' Union (United Kingdom), with 50 of its branches taking part, and small grants were made available by the European Commission for local events with a budget of less than ¬£10,000. The National Music Day Foundation was created to support the events, chaired by Goldsmith, with trustees including Baron Armstrong of Ilminster. To mark the launch Glastonbury Festival, which was taking place on the same weekend, was linked to National Music Day. BBC Radio 1 hosted a National Music Day Roadshow in Glasgow. Richard Allinson won a Gold at Radio Academy Awards for his coverage of the first event on BBC Radio 2, which was part of a 15 hour day of broadcasts to mark the occasion, which shows also presented by Ken Bruce. In 1993, the event became two days, taking place on the 26 and 27 June. It was launched at Hard Rock Cafe, London, by Peter Brooke, Baron Brooke of Sutton Mandeville and Right Said Fred. More 1,100 live events took place across the country. A live broadcast by MCM Networks, and sponsored by Coca-Cola, linked 41 Independent Local Radio stations with venues, and went on to win gold at the Radio Academy Awards for Outstanding Special Event. Buzzcocks performed a live version of their song Lipstick on BBC Radio 1 that was later released on a BBC Sessions album by the band in 1997. The event's third rendition took place on 26 June 1994, and was again marked with a day of broadcasts on BBC Radio 2. Arts Council England awarded ¬£40,000 in grants. In 1995, BBC coverage of the event continued, which included a special edition of Songs of Praise from Pebble Mill, in Birmingham. The fifth event took place on the 30 June 1996, and coincided with the UEFA Euro 1996 Final. It was now chaired by record producer Keith Lowde, and renamed the National Music Festival. 2,300 events were held, attended by an estimated 3,700,000 people, it is thought that many of these were pre-existing events that would have taken place anyway. It was reported that the event had 'largely failed to capture the public imagination'. Lowde said, in an unpublished interim report for the Foundation: > Whilst finding favour with a large number of event organisers, many of whom > were novices, the concept failed to capture the imagination of the > professional music industry, sponsors and the media. The perceived image of > the \\" ‚Äì Day\\" became generally Middle England, Middle of the Road and Middle > Aged. Despite the event losing cultural significance, it was held again in 1997, with the date moving to August. The List, while reviewing France's National Music Day, reported that the UK efforts had failed to catch-on.  Modern incarnations  In May 2002, BBC Music Live organised a five day namesake event \\"National Music Festival\\" which culminated in a 24 hour broadcast on a bank holiday, Monday 29 May. In 2012, Music Day UK was formed and is the both the name of the renewed event, and the organisation that has been coordinating UK events since 2012. The broader international movement of National Music Days around the world is composed of separate national coordinators working independently towards common goals. It is expected that all participants in their respective countries abide by a small set of principles that each event must follow. Primarily these principles insist that all events take place on 21 June (the Summer solstice in the northern hemisphere); that the events are free at the point of entry; and that events are accessible to the general public.  Notable events  *Gloria Hunniford and Matthew Kelly present Opera Singalong, live from the Royal Albert Hall. *At London's Hammersmith Odeon, 30 June 1993, an event called 'A Celebration of the Blues' featured Mick Jagger, Ronnie Wood, Jimmy Rogers, the Charlie Watts Quintet, Gary Moore and Pops Staples.  Cultural impact  A number of events that were organised as part of National Music Day continued to run for many years after the national effort ceased to continue.

The active lighthouse marks the northern approaches to the Sound of Islay a narrow channel separating Islay from the adjacent island of Jura, and is one of the seven lighthouses operated by the Northern Lighthouse Board, which act as maritime aids to navigation on and around Islay. History The need for lights near the sound had been identified as early as 1835 by Robert Stevenson, with the Board of Trade requesting that the light should cover the Neva Rocks to the west. This requirement meant that a substantial tower was required. It was designed by the brothers David Stevenson and Thomas the sons of Robert, from the notable Stevenson lighthouse engineering family. The original lens in the gardens of Colonsay House Construction started in 1857 and it was completed in 1859. The total cost was ¬£6,500 (equivalent to ¬£ as of ). The lighthouse consists of a brick cylindrical white washed tower, supporting the lantern and single gallery. It has 158 steps to the top of the tower. Sandstone was used to construct the window and door openings. The architecture of the long keeper's cottages was criticised in a report from 1861 as looking 'more like dog kennels than anything else'. Access to the lighthouse has always been difficult due to its remote location, bringing in supplies and relief keepers was eased by the use of helicopters in the 1980s. Helicopters were also used to help in construction of an overhead electricity line to the site in 1981. One helicopter crashed during the project, and the pilot survived the accident. The new supply meant that a sealed beam electric lighting unit could be installed in 1982, and the light was automated the following year. The keepers were withdrawn and the cottages were sold, which are now private property. The tower and its light are still operated and maintained by the Northern Lighthouse Board. The original 3rd order fresnel optic was preserved and now forms part of a garden feature at Colonsay House on the nearby island of Colonsay. Listed buildings The entire station including the tower, keeper's cottages, and boundary walls are protected as a category B listed building.

In 2006, he was appointed to the Bertelsmann executive board, of which he has been chairman and chief executive officer since 2012. Under his leadership, the Group has become more international, more digital and more diversified. In particular, he has advanced the business with music rights and the educational division. Additionally, Rabe was appointed chief executive officer of RTL Group in 2019.  Early life and education  Rabe was born in 1965 in Luxembourg and grew up in Brussels, where his father worked as a civil servant in the European Coal and Steel Community from 1968. He attended the European School and as a youth was a bass player in a punk band. After completing his German baccalaureate (Abitur), Rabe studied Business and Economics at the RWTH Aachen and the University of Cologne. After earning a degree in business administration in 1989, he obtained his doctorate in economics, with a doctoral thesis on \\"Liberalization and Deregulation in the European Single Market for Insurance\\" in 1995. In addition to his native language German, Rabe speaks English, French, Dutch and Spanish.  Career  Rabe began his career at the European Commission in Brussels. At the Commission, from 1989 he worked in the Directorate-General for Financial Institutions and Corporate Law. One year later, he joined his supervisor in moving to the law firm Forrester, Norall & Sutton, which today belongs to White & Case. There he managed client accounts from the European Union, the United States and Japan. In 1991, Rabe was employed by the Treuhand agency in Berlin. In this capacity, among other responsibilities, he was in charge of the privatization of the assets of the Ministry for State Security and the National People's Army of the former GDR. In 1993, he was promoted to head of the Controlling Department. Subsequently, Rabe was involved as head of acquisitions at the Beteiligungsgesellschaft Neue L√§nder investment agency of the Association of German Banks (BdB), in investing DM 400 million in East German companies. After earning his Ph.D., in 1996 Rabe was hired as office head of the CEO of the Luxembourg financial service provider, Cedel International. He held additional positions there before being appointed chief financial officer in 1998. In subsequent years, he prepared the merger of Cedel International with Deutsche B√∂rse Clearing into Clearstream. In 2000, Rabe joined RTL Group as CFO. Here, he was additionally responsible for strategy and the Luxembourg television and radio business. Five years later, Bertelsmann brought him back to G√ºtersloh. Rabe was appointed as the Group's CFO on January 1, 2006. At the same time, he was responsible for the Bertelsmann Music Group until 2008. Among other activities, Rabe also negotiated the buyback of shares from Groupe Bruxelles Lambert to prevent Bertelsmann from going public. In addition, the Group established its own investment fund in Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments. Later, Rabe organized the return of Bertelsmann into the music business. His recruitment of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. as an investor in BMG Rights Management was seen as a key decision for the music company's future development. Around 2009 Rabe was reportedly considered as future CEO of the ProSiebenSat.1 Media group and of the Franz Haniel & Cie. investment holding, but Rabe ultimately stayed with Bertelsmann. ;CEO of Bertelsmann, 2012‚Äìpresent After Hartmut Ostrowski announced his retirement as chairman and CEO in 2011, Rabe was declared his successor, effective January 1, 2012. With Rabe's appointment, Bertelsmann ushered in a strategy change towards stronger growth. Under his leadership, Bertelsmann experienced increased growth into Brazil, China, and India, and consolidated this development by bundling these activities in the Bertelsmann Investments division. Also, Rabe managed to complete the merger of Penguin Books with Random House to create the world's largest trade book publisher, and the purchase of the remaining shares in Gruner + Jahr. He built the education division into an additional pillar of the business, which today operates as the Bertelsmann Education Group. He consolidated the printing operations into the Bertelsmann Printing Group. Thus, by 2016, he had expanded the number of corporate divisions to eight. Rabe's contract as chairman and CEO of Bertelsmann's executive board runs until 2021. As CEO of RTL Group, he oversees the company's TV unit; he is a member of the board of directors of Penguin Random House, among others.

Mr. Gasƒ±mlƒ± is a member of the Board of Directors of Azerbaijan Press Council and World Azerbaijanis‚Äô Coordination Council. Scientific career His name is associated with the study and research of several essential issues‚Äì Azerbaijan's International cultural relations (1946-1991), UN discussion of conditions in Southern Azerbaijan after the movement of Sayyed Ja‚Äôfar Pishevari, Political relations between Azerbaijan and Turkey (1920 - 1922), Foreign countries and Azerbaijan (1920 - 1922), The activities of Armenian armed ‚Äúvolunteer‚Äù gangs during the First World War, The policies of the great powers towards Azerbaijan during the First World War (1914 - 1918), Diplomatic and political relations between Turkey and the USSR (1960-1991), Azerbaijan and foreign countries (1920 - 1945), The ‚ÄúArmenian issue‚Äù to ‚ÄúArmenian genocide‚Äù (1724 - 1920), The South Caucasus and Entente countries and Relations between Russia and Turkey (1920 - 1923). Musa Gasimli has worked in the archives and published many valuable articles in Azerbaijan, Russia, Turkey, United States, Georgia, UN in Austria, OSCE in the Czech Republic and the UK. His first major research work was in relation to Azerbaijan's international and cultural relations during the period after World War II until the Soviet Union's collapse. It was a successful start to research the dynamics of international and cultural relations during this period. The results of the study were based on rich archives under the control of the Center during Soviet rule. This monograph which was published in Baku also was published at ‚ÄúArtanudji‚Äù press in Georgia. From 1992-1993 Musa Gasimli discussed conditions in Iranian Azerbaijan after the Sayyed Ja‚Äôfar Pishevari movement at the newly established UN General Assembly and in 1993 published his research paper, \\"Azerbaijan in International Politics\\", at \\"Azernashr\\" press. This was a first step in Azerbaijani History. Gasimli raised the essence of disputes relating to Soviets troops in Iran between two representatives originally from Azerbaijan: an envoy from the Soviet Union in the UN (A.Vishinski) and an envoy from Iran (originally from the Ordubad region in Azerbaijan) - Sayyed Hasan Tagizadeh. He also touched upon US and Soviet politics in Iranian Azerbaijan. The author writes that the West believes that the Cold War was started first in Europe, but in fact the crisis emerged from Iranian Azerbaijan. Musa Gasimli denotes in his article: ‚Äú...for many years in non-scientific theses, the concept that that the US and other Western countries were guilty for the Cold War dominated‚Äù. Now the ‚Äúcold war‚Äù has ended. The main guilty party of this war, the Soviet empire, collapsed and the West was victorious. The issue of Azerbaijan became one of the most controversial in the field of international relations and was the first seed into the cold war after the former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill‚Äôs speech in Fulton in March 1945 (page 24-25). This was a new concept in Azerbaijani and world history that was first introduced by Musa Gasimli. Later, other Azerbaijani historians under Musa Gasimli‚Äôs supervision conducted research on this issue and developed the concept of the start of the Cold war crisis in Iranian Azerbaijan. Professor Jamil Hasanli says in his article ‚ÄúSouth Azerbaijan: between Tehran ‚Äì Baku ‚Äì Moscow (1939 ‚Äì 1945)‚Äù published in 1998, that Professor Musa Gasimli's book ‚ÄúThe Issue of Azerbaijan in International Relations‚Äù can be considered as one of the most successful steps during recent years\\" (page 12-13). Also, Professor Musa Gasimli researched the diplomatic and political relations of Azerbaijan with other countries, including Turkey, and the period of Bolshevik occupation until the establishment of the Soviet Union. These years involved a short period of independence of Azerbaijan. The author researched the means of Bolshevik Russia that put an end to Azerbaijan's foreign policy and closed representative offices. Along with Baku, this research was published as a book in Turkey and Iran. Professor Musa Gasimli for the first time in his country studied the policy of great powers towards Azerbaijan during World War I. In relation to this he is the author of a three-volume monograph. He investigated the activities of armed Armenian ‚Äúvolunteer‚Äù gangs in the South Caucasus. On this subject he gave a number of speeches in international scientific symposiums and those reports have been published. Musa Gasimli also studied Azerbaijan's struggle for independence and problems with foreign countries during 1920-1945, wrote a large-volume monograph and the study was published in Istanbul's ‚ÄúKaknus‚Äù Press in 2006. The book was one of the best-selling books at a book fair in Frankfurt, Germany. Gasimli also studied the diplomatic and political struggle for influence between Russia, Turkey and Entente countries in the South Caucasus from 1920-1923. The professor also published a monograph based on the most reliable materials and archives related to the period starting from the decree of the Russian Emperor Peter the Great, until Armenian SSR in 1920, regarding the placement of Armenians in Azerbaijani territories, the capture of land, creation of armed gangs, as well as large-scale massacres of civil Muslim and Turkish populations. The monograph was published in Azerbaijani, Russian, Turkish and English in different countries.SSCB T√ºrkiye ƒ∞li≈ükileri 14 large scale monographs and also about 82 scientific articles involving subjects which had never before been researched in Azerbaijani history until that time were published in the US, Argentina, Turkey, Great Britain, Germany, Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Romania, Kazakhstan, Macedonia, Moldova, Georgia, Iran, Cyprus, Czech Republic and other countries in English, Spanish, Turkish, Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, Persian and other languages. Many positive reviews about the monographs have been published abroad. Many scientists from the United States, Russia, Turkey, Ukraine, Georgia, Iraq, Poland, and Romania have relied on his works in their articles. The works published in Azerbaijan and abroad have brought him fame and recognition as an outstanding historian. From 1983-2014 he lectured at more than 30 scientific conferences in Azerbaijan.

It is located in the townland of Tullycommon, parish of Kilnaboy, not far from the larger ringfort Cahercommaun and Tullycommon Wedge Tomb. History View from the road to the southwest, 2012. The townland of Tullycommon is probably the Tuluauch-comyn held by (King Torlough) O'Brien in 1298 as given in the Pipe rolls. Through it in 1317 the army of Diarmait O'Brien reportedly marched on his way to Corcomroe Abbey, \\"along the fortress-begirt tracks\\" between Leana and Crughwill. Hugh Roe O'Donnell's troops plundered it in their great raid into Thomond in 1599. Excavation unearthed middens, deer and ox bones. Description This cashel is a stone fort situated on the top of a steep- sided rocky outcrop. When antiquarian Thomas Johnson Westropp visited it in the 1910s, the ramparts of the ringfort were preserved in three places and built of long worked blocks. They reached their greatest height in the northeast at 4 m (13 ft) and a thickness of 2.7 to 3.0 m (9‚Äì10 ft). The gate opened to the edge of a steep 10 m high slope. At the foot of the slope were rock fragments, probably the broken lintels of the gatehouse. The fort measures internally about 40 m from north to south and 23 m from west to east. The gate was 3 m above ground level and was probably reached by ladder. The ruins of four round huts and one beehive hut were found on Cashlaungar.

Life  His memorial plaque on his home Richter was born in Ecs√©d, Hungary, but due to the death of his parents, from 1873 he grew up in Gy√∂ngy√∂s. From 1890 he worked there as a trainee pharmacist. In 1895 Richter completed his degree in pharmacology with a high mark at the Budapest University. Two years later, he travelled to several European pharmacies and pharmaceutical companies, studying their drug manufacturing methods. In 1901 he bought the pharmacy named as the Eagle at the corner on the √úll≈ëi Road and M√°rton Street in Budapest, producing organo- therapeutic drugs. In 1907, in K≈ëb√°nya, on 63 Cserkesz Street, he built, and took charge of, the first pharmaceutical factory in Hungary. The factory had its first major success with a kind of Aspirin called Kalmopyrin, and the disinfectant hydrogen peroxide in tablets called Hyperol, which were patented in 1912 and went on to play an important role in the World War I. Before the war, he already had 24 pharmaceutical patents.  World War 2  By the start of World War II, his pharmaceutical network had representatives on five continents, with 10 subsidiaries and in 34 states with commission repositories. In 1942, he was stripped from his position as director (due to anti-Semitic laws), and banned from his factory. Then he managed the company from his home with the staff he trusted. In the autumn of 1944 the factory activity was almost completely paralyzed. Even though he had the opportunity to leave Budapest and move to Switzerland, he did not want to leave the company. His wife and himself were hidden by Raoul Wallenberg with more than a thousand other Jews. After being caught, Richter was murdered by the Hungarian \\"nyilas\\" national socialists (Arrow Cross Party) in December 1944, along with others shot, and thrown into the Danube.  Impact  After the war, the factory was rebuilt under the name of Richter Pharmaceutical Factory in K≈ëb√°nya. In 1972, on the 100th anniversary of Richter's birth, a commemorative medal was struck, and a memorial plaque was added to the Eagle pharmacy. Richter made the first organo-therapeutic composition for raising blood pressure, an adrenal hormone extract (adrenaline), and the Kalmopyrin and the Tonogen suprarenale which are all still used in medicine. His family house now operates as a school, under the name Richter Gedeon Elementary School in Ecs√©d. The room in which he was born functions as a gym today. Personal life In 1902 he married to Anna Winkler, the daughter of a timber manufacturer of Szeged, Hungary. The couple's only son, L√°szl√≥ was born in 1903.

It addresses certain or uncertain threats in cyberspace by the principle of uncertain defense, and provides the strategic varieties and transformations of DRS elements inside objects in quantity or type, time or space dimension under the condition of unchanged visual functions. It provides a generally innovative defense theory and method to deal with the ‚Äúknown unknown risk‚Äù and ‚Äúunknown unknown risk‚Äù which exist in related application levels of different areas of cyberspace and are based on unknown vulnerabilities, backdoors, viruses, Trojans, etc. This method can provide not only endogenous security gains which are independent of traditional security means and achieved via integrated structural technologies for critical infrastructures or key information equipment, but also resilient or restorable service ability with intensive attributes inherited from the architecture. Further it acquires super nonlinear effects combining mature defense technologies. It's aimed at creating a non-closed, self-controlled and sustainable-developed ecological environment which adapts to globalization technologies and industrial development models and integrates with win-win cooperation and open sources.  Background  In the current cyberspace, there are \\"unknown unknown threats\\", namely uncertain threats. Usually, such threats are originated from human attacks, based on existing unknown design bugs referred as vulnerabilities in hardware and software of information systems, or induced from backdoor attacks, based on mounting malicious codes of software and hardware in the era of globalization which cannot ensure the credibility of the industry chain. Based on the existing scientific level and cognitive ability of human beings, it's impossible to make a scientific judgment neither from the theory nor from the practice that complex information systems have no vulnerabilities and backdoors. Moreover, it's impossible to completely avoid design bugs or backdoors in the engineering level. So it's a consensus in the field of security that the biggest threat in cyberspace comes from unknown vulnerabilities, backdoors, viruses or Trojans, etc. The existing defense system is the concept of precise defense based on perceptual cognition, which requires a certain amount of clear and reliable prior knowledge as the support, such as sources, characteristics, processes and behavior of attack, working in the precondition of ‚Äúknown risks‚Äù or ‚Äúknown unknown risks‚Äù. So it's an acquired defense system with the \\"bottom line defense\\", often supported by encryption or authentication. It is a common fragility in the system and mechanism of defense against unknown vulnerabilities, backdoors, viruses or Trojans, etc. Especially in the ecological environment of system hardware and software components whose credibility cannot be ensured, main defense means based on it almost have no effective real-time defense capability in the face of uncertain threats except for repairing after damages have been done ( ‚Äúmending the fold after the sheep have been stolen‚Äù) without the security guarantee of steps in encryption and authentication or other defensive functions, which can bypass or make short circuits deliberately. Additionally, existing information systems have static structures, similar functions, and certain operating mechanisms. These features can't provide attackers with the facilitation such as objective identification, defense behavior detection, attack techniques testing and refining, combat effectiveness evaluation and so on. Meanwhile, most of the information systems inherit the operating mechanisms of single processing space and resources sharing, so that invaders can achieve the desired operation through the operating mechanisms of resources sharing when they enter this space. This is also one of the important basic conditions in many network attack theories, including ‚Äúthe side channel attack‚Äù which is used to break through the ‚Äúphysical isolation network‚Äù nowadays. As a result, the largest black hole of cyber security consists of determinacy in the information system architecture and mechanism, fragility in passive defensive system, deficiency in active immune mechanisms and other key issues.  Basic Concepts   Foundation of the Axioms  Axiom 1Ôºö‚ÄúThere are many algorithms to reach the goal under the condition of given functions and performance.‚Äù These diversified heterogeneous algorithms are equivalent under the condition of given functions and performance. If it can be proven that union or intersection calculation results of feasible methods can still meet requirements of equivalent functions, no matter what scheduling strategies or dynamic combination of these heterogeneous algorithms are done, it will not change the given functions. Accordingly, the mapping relationship between the visual functions and the structure of the object is no longer unique or certain from the perspective of attackers, which can be used to achieve the active defense by the defenders. Axiom 2Ôºö‚ÄúEveryone has diverse shortcomings while they rarely make the same mistakes on the same tasks in the same place at the same time.‚Äù This axiom provides a theoretical basis for applications of multi-mode ruling mechanisms of the heterogeneous redundancy architecture in fault tolerance, handling random failures of hardware and software in the field of reliability. This means that cyber problems based on unknown vulnerabilities, backdoors, Trojans, viruses and certain or uncertain threats can be transformed into risk protection problems through heterogeneous and redundant mechanism defense. Unless the attackers have resources and capabilities to achieve the consistent error expression through a cooperative attack dilemma under the condition of non-cooperation in heterogeneous multi- target space, it is difficult for attackers to escape from the multi-mode arbitral mechanism.  Implementation Architecture  _Dynamic Heterogeneous Redundancy Architecture_ ÔºåDHR  Operating Mechanism  Through the multi- mode policy ruling and multi-dimensional dynamic reconfiguration mechanism under the condition of ‚Äúde-cooperation‚Äù, difficult and costly engineering problems of the attack surface of complex systems can be turned into reduced problems of the attack surface of soft and hard parts, which is space- independent, function-simple and within mimic bracket. Moreover, it's able to minimize the dominant or recessive correlation among heterogeneous redundant entities, which causes the heterogeneous multi-target dynamic cooperative attack dilemma for attackers under the condition of non-cooperation. This reduces the engineering difficulty to implement ‚Äúself-control, secure and trustable‚Äù strategy in cyberspace from ‚Äúno security short board of the whole chain‚Äù to the guarantee of the absolute security of individual procedures or key components.  Security Concept  With the idea of the Moving Attack Surface, (MAS), the CMD system can be regarded as a kind of proactive defense system which deploys the multi-dimensional attack surface in an unpredictable way under the condition of visually-unchanged functions. Due to multiple- heterogeneity of structures and environments from each executive entity, it enables resources exploited by attackers (including lurkers) to have uncertainty in temporal and spatial dimensions. At the macro level, it appears that the attack surface is always making irregular movements. Especially for those attack missions which need multiple steps to transmit data to achieve attack goals, the premise of achievability can hardly be guaranteed.  Security Gain  Mimic defense gains (MDG) purely acquire nonlinear security gains through endogenous mechanisms of the framework. MDG in the mimic defense framework is endogenous. In mechanisms, there is no dependence on existing security defense technologies, such as encryption authentication, firewall filtering, virus detection, intrusion detection (Trojan removal), prevention, isolation and removal measures while traditional incremental means (vulnerability patching, backdoor blocking or malicious code removal, etc.) can be seen as supplementary measures to stabilize the defense effect. Besides, it has no real-time requirements for above technologies. However, the heterogeneous property of the Mimic system can be significantly enhanced with combination of these traditional security technologies, and results in improving the defensive capability of the object in a super nonlinear way.  Technical Route  CMD has the following features. It integrates a variety of proactive defense elements technically as the concept. And the similarity and singularity of the target system are altered via heterogeneity and diversity while the static state and certainty of the target system are transformed through dynamic and stochastic means. Also it identifies and shields unknown defects and threats based on heterogeneous, redundant and multi-mode ruling mechanisms. Further, it enhances the flexibility or elasticity of the service function of the target system via high reliable architecture. Simultaneously, it defends or denies an uncertain threat to the target system depending on systems‚Äô uncertain attributes. The above objectives can be achieved by a DHR- based and integrated technological framework.  Mimic Defense Boundary  MDB (also abbreviated as Mimic Boundary) contains a number of service (operation) functions with normative definitions and strict agreements. Through consistency or conformance tests of these standardized protocols or specifications, we can determine the equivalence of multiple heterogeneous executive entities (complexity-unlimited) on given service (operation) functions or even performance. That is to say, the equivalence between functional executive entities, including the consistency of given exception handling functions or performance, can be judged via the consistency tests of the relationship between input and output through MDB. And the integrity, effectiveness and security of functions defined by MDB are a prerequisite for effective mimic defense, while functions (operations) not defined by MDB explicitly don't belong to the scope of mimic defense (but there may exist a derived protective effect). In other words, if attackers do not make the output vectors inconsistent on the Mimic Boundary, the mimic mechanism won't react. Therefore, it is essentially important to set, divide and choose MDB reasonably in engineering implementation. Specifically, security issues beyond MDB don't belong to the scope of mimic defense. For example, security threats are caused by means which are independent of unknown vulnerabilities, backdoors or other factors within MDB, like fishing, bundling malicious functions in service software, pushing virus codes in cross-platform interpreted executive files and carrying toxic software through downloading behaviors from users.  Mimic Escape, ME  Mimic Escape refers to the process in which attackers make the heterogeneous redundant entities in MDB produce identical or mostly identical errors, thus breaking through the multi- mode arbitral mechanism and achieving the attack. Mimic Escape is an uncertain problem whose performance is not stable because of the DHR mechanism, and cannot be expressed by probability. More generally, ‚Äúthere is no second chance for a successful attack.‚Äù  Mimic Presentation, MP  Mimic Presentation refers to the visual relationship between the external service functions observed by attackers and the implementation structures of the object. The more complicated, less certainty and more diverse the relationship is, the more unpredictable the defensive behavior and environment of the object will be. Accordingly, the creation and maintenance of an attack chain will be more difficult, and the possibility of planning or deploying the attack will be lower. When the number and types of the heterogeneous redundant entities are determined, the levels of Mimic Presentation are strongly correlated to the scheduling and generation strategies for the set of executive entities.  Mimic Defense Levels   Utter-Shielding Level  If the given MDB is facing an external invasion or ‚Äúinsider‚Äù attacks, protected functions, services and information are not affected and attackers can't make any assessment on attack effectiveness, as if they fall into an ‚Äúinformation black hole‚Äù, which is called the utter shielding level, the highest level of mimic defense.  Non-sustainable Level  If the given MDB is facing an external invasion or ‚Äúinsider‚Äù attacks, protected functions or information may make corrections after error-making or be self-healing with uncertain probability or duration. For attackers, even if they make a breakthrough, they hardly maintain attacks‚Äô effects or can't provide any meaningful basis for subsequent attacks, which is called the non-sustainable level.  Hard-reproducible Level  If the given MDB is facing an external invasion or ‚Äúinsider‚Äù attacks, protected functions or information may be out of control in a certain duration while it's hard to reproduce the same scene with repeating identical attacks. In other words, the attack scene or experience after a breakthrough can't be inherited and lacks in utilized value in time dimension, which is called the hard-reproduced level.  Principles of Grading  More defense levels can be defined to meet comprehensive demands for security and implementation cost in different application scenarios. Four factors have to be taken into account regarding the security. The core of mimic defense is different-degree uncertainty on attack actions. The non-perceptive trait makes it impossible for attackers to acquire effective information of the defender at all stages of the attack chain. The non-sustainable feature enables the attack chain to lose its utilized stability. And the non-reproducible character makes it difficult to exploit experience based on accumulative probes and attacks as priori knowledge in the following attack missions.  Applicable Field  Under the condition of the functional input-output relationship or meeting the IPO model, to solve the problem of service functions, performance and important information resources must be explicit and robust providing, insensitive to initial investment or product pricing, space or power consumption are acceptable and there are standard or standardized functional interfaces and protocol specifications and multiple or diverse processing conditions as well as occasions where the reliability and availability of the system or device are challenged by the traditional security and cyberspace non-traditional security. It should be pointed out that, under the above conditions, it is suitable to implement the mimic defense in any application where the target algorithm is determined and there are other equivalent algorithms. As the accuracy of results between different algorithms with function equivalence may be different (for example, the result is accurate to several decimal places.), or if the range of the control amount is a range, even if the problem is applied to a subject such as a scientific calculation or an application in an industrial control field, multi-mode decisions can also be made using a policy such as \\"precision mask\\" or \\"expected range\\".  Application Progress  Mimic Web Server Mimic Router Mimic File and Storage System Mimic Industrial Control Processor  Mimic Phenomenon and Mimic Defense  The Mimic Phenomenon (MP) means that a creature simulates another creature or environment in color, texture, shape and other features so that one or both of the parties benefit from the ecological adaptation. From the perspective of the defender, it can be included in the category of active defense based on the endogenous mechanism, referred as Mimic Guise (MG). Besides the simulation in color, texture, shape and other features, we refer the simulation of behavior and state as Mimic Defense (MD). To be specific in cyberspace, under the premise of remaining unchanged in given functions and performance of an object, it can be transformed in space-time dimension strategically such as system architectures, operation processes, core algorithms, abnormal behavior and other environmental factors as well as unknown vulnerabilities, backdoors or Trojans, viruses which may exist in an attached mode . Accordingly, we refer this system and mechanism of defense as Cyber Mimic Defense (CMD).  Dynamic Heterogeneous Redundancy Architecture (DHR)  DHR is a theoretical method of achieving mimic defense. It's based on a dissimilar redundancy structure (DRS) in the field of reliability and introduces the mechanism of dynamically multi- dimensional reconfiguration, which enables it not only have high reliability of DRS but also high security of mimic defense. We refer this heterogeneous redundant structure as a dynamic heterogeneous redundancy (DHR) architecture.  Composition and Operating Process of DHR  DHR architecture The architecture of DHR is composed of the input agent, a set of heterogeneous components, dynamic selection algorithms, a set of executive entities and multi-mode arbitrators. In the diagram, the set of heterogeneous components and dynamic selection algorithms support the dynamic reconstruction in multi- dimension, which makes the set of executive entities dynamic. Multiple kinds of sets in which heterogeneous components are functionally equivalent can be combined by the software and hardware of standardization in module collection. The inputs are conveyed from the agent to n executive entities in set, represented as A_1,A_2,...,A_n selected from the collection E in Dynamic selection algorithm. Finally, system outputs are provided from the arbitrating between the output vectors through the multi-mode arbitrator.  Mimic Bracket  In the DHR architecture, system inputs are conveyed from the input agent to every executive entity in the current set, and system outputs are provided from the arbitrating between the output vectors through the multi- mode arbitrator. We refer both of the input agent and multi-mode arbitrator as the Mimic Bracket (MB).  Mimic Defense Boundary in DHR  Mimic Bracket, the combination of the input agent and multi-mode arbitrator, is operated in independent physical or logical space but coordinated functionally. The Mimic Defense Boundary (MDB), also abbreviated for Mimic Boundary, is defined by the Mimic Bracket as a range of protection. MDB is usually a heterogeneous redundant environment operated with ‚Äútoxics and Bacteria‚Äù, which contains unknown vulnerabilities, backdoors and other bugs of hardware and software or viruses, Trojans, and malicious codes. In this environment, heterogeneous executive entities under the condition of a certain functional input sequence, can give a complete consistent output sequence essentially.  The Anti- attack Feature of DHR  Firstly, the mechanisms of DHR can make the system show much uncertainty to the attacker within the controllable and cost acceptable range for the defender, which provides a powerful solution to security threats of the statically deterministic DRS. It can also force the inevitable human attack, different from the fault-error, into a risk control problem of minimum probability, which can normalize the threat of certainty or uncertainty into a reliability problem of stochastic failure according to the physical mechanism of DHR. Secondly, it is a big challenge to make precise cooperation between homogeneous redundant components according to the related researches. Hence the heterogeneous feature of DHR will make cooperation more difficult for attackers. Furthermore, dynamism and randomness can improve the uncertainty of multi-participatory actions with consistent or synergistic requirements. Last but not least, the multi-mode arbitrator significantly enhances the difficulty of cooperative attack under the condition of non- cooperation.  The Significance of DHR Construction  If the elements in the set of heterogeneous executive entities satisfying functional equivalence are scheduled in dynamic policies, or deploy the generalized dynamic technologies such as reconfiguration, recombination, reconstruction, redefinition, and virtualization themselves, we could simplify or weaken the harsh requirements of dissimilarity design accordingly in DRS. In the post- globalization era, this conclusion is of great engineering significance for the application of trustability-uncontrollable components, including open source software, hardware or middleware and so on, to build a safe and reliable system as well as to reduce the cost, in product life cycle over the open industrial chain and the supplying chain.  Mimic Computing and Mimic Defense  Mimic computing can dynamically select the solution structure environment adaptively, according to different tasks, different time, different loads, different performance requirements, different resource conditions and parameters. Mimic computing can improve processing efficiency with the benefit of structure variable computing based on active cognition. Mimic Defense fully mines the structure variable computing on the mechanism of endogenous anti-attack properties. As the external appearance is dynamic and random, the Mimic Computing system seems to be in active jumping or rapid migration irregularly in the vision of attackers in the time-space dimension among the diverse environments. It shows strongly dynamic, heterogeneous, random and other uncertain characteristics, disturbing the observation and the prediction, which will increase the difficulty and cost of constructing the attack chain based on vulnerability and backdoors. In summary, mimic computing and mimic defense are based on a computing and processing architecture in essence, which is structure-variable under the condition of functionally equivalence. With the full use of structure variable computing, mimic computing can improve processing efficiency and mimic defense can provide the ability of active defense.  Differences from Moving Target Defense (MTD)   Different Technology Roadmaps  Mimic Defense is a kind of architectural technology derived from fault tolerance in the field of reliability. Its fundamental form evolved from static DRS served as fault tolerance to DHR applied in intrusion tolerance. However, MTD is inspired by the idea of Encryption and Scrambler, which typically makes the instruction, address, or data of systems dynamic, random and diverse in order to increase the level of efforts required to achieve a successful compromise.  Different Technical Systems  The technical implementation of Mimic Defense is based on DHR, which has the intensive property with functions, reliability and security trinity. It is not necessary to expose technical details of the functional equivalent components of heterogeneous redundant hardware and software. MTD is a purely defensive technique which belongs to the simple \\"stack\\" of the non- systematic discrete technique, and it is not transparent to the protective object.  Different Implementation Space  Mimic Defense emphasizes on the implementation of a DHR architecture, which is operated in independent physical or logical space and correlated weakly with the operating mechanism of shared resource. MTD depends on the operating mechanism of shared resources, usually coexisting in the same processing space with objects, which seriously affects the objective performance of services due to the cost of processing resources.  Different Implementation Approaches  In Mimic Defense, it is requested that the object has functionally equivalent implementation support from the diverse hardware and software components as redundant. That is, in the premise of not affecting the service performance, the way to improve the security is a trade of the software and hardware resources while MTD mainly uses software to realize dynamic changes, diversification and randomization in the case of certain resource, in exchange for security by consuming the resources of the objective system and reducing the performance of the services.  Different Degrees of Attack Difficulty  The classic method of Mimic Defense is intended to build the redundant working environment with multi-mode judging mechanisms, composed of multiple dynamic reconfigurable components in functionally equivalence. When the same input arrives at heterogeneous executive entities, the only consistent output is intuitively generated by the intersection of functions in these entities through the multi-mode judging process. Any attack based on the specific implementation of one entity, including the attacks to multiple entities simultaneously, is hard to bypass the mimic judging mechanism under the condition of non-cooperation and turns out to be a failure. So for the attackers, it is necessary to solve the problem including not only the accessibility of attack packets and the availability of vulnerabilities, but also to achieve the consistent error expression through the cooperative attack dilemma under the condition of non-cooperation in heterogeneous multi-target space. It can overcome the impact of so many uncertainties while MTD can not provide such degrees of difficulty for attackers.  Different Capabilities of Attack Tolerance  Based on the benefit from the DHR structure in functionally equivalence, Mimic Defense keeps the fault tolerance and intrusion tolerance property in MDB as long as consistent mistakes arise by falling from the majority of executive entities at the same time. MTD emphasizes the functional recovery after the compromise, which is called resilience and tenacity. Obviously, the protective effect of the former is much higher than that of the latter.  Different Defense Objects  Mimic Defense is effective not only in defending the external attacks based on unknown vulnerabilities, backdoors, front doors, trapdoors, etc., but also against the unknown viruses, Trojans and other penetration attacks. However, MTD only considers the impact of the unknown vulnerabilities.  Different Application Modes  Due to the differences between the two technical systems and implementation approaches, Mimic Defense can use both of open source products and COTS black-boxes whose credibility cannot be ensured, but MTD excessively depends on white-boxes on the contrary. So the former can avoid the most tremendous trouble from technology promotion, with more inclusiveness, openness and attractiveness, and turns out to have greater prospects for commercial promotion and researches.  Differences from Trustable Computing   Mimic defense doesn‚Äôt belong to the technology of computational complexity  Mimic defense can't distinguish between right and wrong from the results itself, which is computed or operated by components of hardware and software. It just refers to the situation of consistency, arbitrated between responsive outputs which are produced by heterogeneous redundant entities from the same input excitation, as a basis of recognition under the condition of functional equivalence. It is usually a big probability event that most of the expressions are consistent. This is considered as the law of identification with normal or abnormal states although it is easy to prove both in theory and practice that consistent error existing in most expressions is a minimal probability event. The key of breaking through the Mimic Defense system is the solution on how to obtain the consistent errors in most entities, achieving the escape stably, under the condition of non- cooperation and DHR environment at the same time. Trustable Computing, could be considered as a technique of encryption and belongs to the category of computational complexity technology which is not the same as Mimic defense in security principles.  Mimic defense doesn‚Äôt have credibility problems of the Trusted Computing Base (TCB)  The Mimic defense ruling refers to the majority or minority of outputs judged by the arbitrator, by using the relativity results as identification rules without any absolutely credible outputs except the correctness of the arbitrator. However, the \\"absolute security\\" of the Trusted Computing BaseÔºàTPM or TCMÔºâis the fundamental of Trusted Computing, and is still controversial because of the unsettled problem that \\"who guarantees the credibility of TCB\\".  Mimic Defense is transparent to components of hardware and software  For heterogeneous redundancy components of hardware and software which are functionally equivalent in MDB, Mimic Defense does not need to make any analysis or customization and has only to operate in accordance with the process of the \\"black box\\" to directly apply COTS-level products whose credibility cannot be ensured. It reduces the cost of the engineering during the realization of defensive techniques. While the object of Trusted Computing must have a degree of transparency so that analysis and intervention are inevitable during the process of implementation (often facing the hard situation in which there are only program files of executable codes), which brings a big challenge to the engineering implementation.  Mimic defense architecture have integrated functions  The Mimic defense architecture is intensive with functions. While providing active defense functions without priori knowledge, the system also gives service functions and the security function of high reliability. However, Trusted Computing only provides the security function and the function of fault detection in a certain level.

The party was launched as an alternative to the national political parties and inclusive development while retaining Goemkarponn (Goan ethos). In a press conference held to announce the launching of the party, then President Prabhakar Timble had stated that the party would be ready to ally with any other political parties except the Bharatiya Janata Party. In the initial days of its formation, the Goa Forward Party was a vocal critichttp://www.uniindia.com/goa-forward-to-sensitise- people-on-anti-goan-policies-of-bjp-govt/other/news/649231.html of the Bharatiya Janata Party and its campaign for the 2017 Goa Legislative Assembly election was majorly based on the anti-BJP plank. To oust the BJP from power was among the party's main prioritieshttp://www.goanews.com/blogs_disp.php?bpid=1071 when it was launched. The first protest by the party along with other opposition parties was held on 27 January 2016 opposing cutting down of coconut trees to make way for the red categoryhttp://www.heraldgoa.in/Goa/Govt-says-cheers-to-red- category-Vani-Agro-beer-factory-/100066.html beer factory by Vani Agro Farms Private Ltd. at Amdai in Sanguem.http://www.goanews.com/news_disp.php?newsid=6764 The party later organised a protest march in the form of a Maad Yatra (Coconut tree march) to protest against the Goa Preservation of Trees (Amendment) Act, 2016 which was passed by the Goa Legislative Assembly.http://www.goanews.com/news_disp.php?newsid=6905 Political leadership The Goa Forward Party during its launch contained no popular politicians but since its inception, the party referred to the three independent MLAs Vijai Sardesai, Rohan Khaunte and Naresh Sawal as 'mentors'. The three MLAs initially backed the partyhttp://www.goanews.com/news_disp.php?newsid=6756 while Sardesai and Khaunte participated in the protests organised by the party too. Many members of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Indian National Congress gradually joined the party. While cricketer Shadab Jakati formally joined the party, cardiologist like Dr. Francisco Colaco campaigned for the party. Subsequently, Naresh Sawal disassociated himselfhttp://www.goanews.com/news_disp.php?newsid=7459 from the party, joining the M. G. Party and unsuccessfullyhttps://www.heraldgoa.in/Goa/North- Goa/MGP-The-lair-is-shrinking-for-the-lion/113385.html contesting the 2017 Assembly elections from the Bicholim constituency as a M. G.

Vijai Sardesai blamed the Goa Pradesh Congress Committee's President Luizinho Faleiro for the failure to form an alliance. The party declared its supporthttps://www.heraldgoa.in/Goa/GF- openly-backs-Cipru-to-damage-Luizinho-in-Navelim/111048.html to the independent candidate Edwin alias Cipru Souza who unsuccessfully contested the 2017 Assembly elections from the Navelim constituency against Luizinho Faleiro. The Indian National Congress accused that the Goa Forward Party was funded by the Bharatiya Janata Party. Manifesto and agenda in 2017 elections In the run-up to the 2017 elections, Goa Forward said its \\"vision\\" was a \\"developed Goa, happy Goans\\". It also spelt out what is said was its mission (\\"empowered Goans\\"), motto (\\"Our Goa, Our Centre, Our Culture\\") and objective (to \\"protect [the] Goan identity\\").Goal 2017. Vote for Coconut. Truly Goan Party. Truly Goan Symbol (election Symbol, Saligao Constituency, 2017 Elections). Saligao: Goa Forward, 2017. Print. Two page, colour pamphlet of the Goa Forward party, circulated prior to the 2017 elections, in Saligao constituency, seeking the election of Jayesh Salgaonkar, ex-Chairman of the North Goa Zilla Panchayat and Candidate of the Goa Forward for Saligao. It listed its promises as: * Setting up of an Employment Promotion Board. * 80% jobs to local youth. * Abolish the Madhya Pradesh Sound Pollution Act and legislate \\"our\\" (i.e. one of Goa's) own. * Affordable pricing of fish, rice, coconut and p√£o (local bread). * Zero-tolerance to the drug trade. * Free WiFi across Goa. * To legislate new laws to fulfil the dream of special status for Goa. * To build Goan partnership in the tourism and mining sectors. * \\"Denationalisation\\" of Goan rivers. Being a new local party, contesting elections for the first time, the Goa Forward also came up with local, constituency-wise \\"priorities\\" of its contestants. For example, in Saligao assembly constituency, its candidate Jayesh Salgaonkar had a list of some 25 one-line \\"top priorities\\" ranging from traffic congestion at Verem, employment for local youth in government enterprise and tourism, promoting rural employment for the SC/ST/OBC communities, taking the benefits of government schemes to the local underprivileged, guaranteeing assistance to those whose lands are acquired by the government (through employment, market price and support to their occupation), connecting internal areas of Saligao by public transport, etc. Other promises made to this constituency include connecting every home to an effective sewerage network; door-to-door garbage collection and making Saligao garbage and plastic free; beautifying open spaces in the constituency; encouraging sports including traditional games and yoga; setting up special day centres for senior citizens; tackling the street- dog \\"menace\\" through NGO intervention by scientific methods; a morgue and hearse van facility in the constituency; green hubs with support from the Horticulture Corporation; hawker zones for \\"inclusive development\\"; showcasing heritage spaces and houses; a 24x7 helpline for Saligao residents in distress; office with staff to settle citizen grievances; dedicated fish and veg markets in all villages; community halls at \\"select locations\\"; gardens and children's parks in all villages with joggers' parks at select locations; development of Coco and Quegdevelim beaches (Nerul); football grounds at Reis Magos, Saligao and Guirim; upgradation of grounds at Sangolda, Pilerne and Nerul; and facilitating water harvesting. The party's 24-point programme promised free water to each household, free power for agriculture, free WiFi access, affordable housing, day-care centres for seniors and children, and fish- coconut-bread at affordable prices. Goa Forward promised to bring the coconut under the Goa Preservation of Trees Act and pledged to declare the coconut as the State Tree. Its party symbol has been the coconut, over which there was a major controversy in Goa in recent years with the BJP government making the important local tree easier to be felled under the law. Goa Forward contested only four of the total forty seats of the Goa Legislative Assembly. The party's President Prabhakar Timble stated that the party had contested in only four constituencies in order to prevent division of the non-Bharatiya Janata Party votes. The party contested in the Fatorda, Velim, Saligao and Siolim constituencies. The party emerged victorious in all three constituencies except Velim. While Jayesh Salgaonkar in Saligao and Vinoda Paliencar in Siolim defeated the Bharatiya Janata Party's political heavyweights Dilip Parulekar and Dayanand Mandrekar respectively, Vijai Sardesai retained his Fatorda seat. Government formation The results of the 2017 Goa Assembly election gave rise to a hung assembly since no political party could achieve a complete majority of 21 in the 40 member Goa Legislative Assembly. The Indian National Congress emerged the largest party with 17 seats but ultimately, the Bharatiya Janata Party which emerged victorious in 13 constituencies formed the government with the support of the Goa Forward Party, Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party and independents. The Goa Forward Party expressed its support to the Bharatiya Janata Party on the condition that the then Union Defence Minister of India Manohar Parrikar would return to Goa as the Chief Minister of Goa. Party's supremo Vijai Sardesai justified his decision by stating that the Indian National Congress party as well as the Goa Pradesh Congress Committee President Luizinho Faleiro had ditched him before. He stated that the BJP in Goa was different from that of the national BJP and that the government would work according to a common minimum programme. Vijai Sardesai claimed that he would act as a watchdog of Geomkarponn (Goanness) in the government and that he had supported the BJP-led government for stability and development. The Goa Forward Party President Prabhakar Timble resigned as the President and subsequently as the primary member of the party after Sardesai and the other two party MLAs accorded their support towards formation of the BJP-led government in Goa. The party and its supremo Vijai Sardesai were heavily criticised for joining the government led by Manohar Parrikar. At a largely attended protest meet on 18 March 2017 at Margao's Lohia Maidan, Sardesai was condemned by many for supporting the Bharatiya Janata Party government led by Manohar Parrikar. On 14 March 2017, the government led by Manohar Parrikar was sworn in. All three MLAs of the party was included in the cabinet. Vijai Sardesai was given the portfolios of Town & Country Planning and Agriculture. Jayesh Salgaonkarhttps://www.goa.gov.in/ministers/shri- jayesh-salgaonkar/ was allotted the portfolios of Housing and Rural Development Agency, while Vinoda Paliencar was allotted the Water Resources Department and Fisheries portfolios.

Because of the Lorentz transformation and time dilation, the concepts of time and distance become more complex, which also leads to more complex definitions of \\"acceleration\\". SR as the theory of flat Minkowski spacetime remains valid in the presence of accelerations, because general relativity (GR) is only required when there is curvature of spacetime caused by the energy-momentum tensor (which is mainly determined by mass). However, since the amount of spacetime curvature is not particularly high on Earth or its vicinity, SR remains valid for most practical purposes, such as experiments in particle accelerators.Misner & Thorne & Wheeler (1973), p. 163: \\"Accelerated motion and accelerated observers can be analyzed using special relativity.\\" One can derive transformation formulas for ordinary accelerations in three spatial dimensions (three- acceleration or coordinate acceleration) as measured in an external inertial frame of reference, as well as for the special case of proper acceleration measured by a comoving accelerometer. Another useful formalism is four- acceleration, as its components can be connected in different inertial frames by a Lorentz transformation. Also equations of motion can be formulated which connect acceleration and force. Equations for several forms of acceleration of bodies and their curved world lines follow from these formulas by integration. Well known special cases are hyperbolic motion for constant longitudinal proper acceleration or uniform circular motion. Eventually, it is also possible to describe these phenomena in accelerated frames in the context of special relativity, see Proper reference frame (flat spacetime). In such frames, effects arise which are analogous to homogeneous gravitational fields, which have some formal similarities to the real, inhomogeneous gravitational fields of curved spacetime in general relativity. In the case of hyperbolic motion one can use Rindler coordinates, in the case of uniform circular motion one can use Born coordinates. Concerning the historical development, relativistic equations containing accelerations can already be found in the early years of relativity, as summarized in early textbooks by Max von Laue (1911, 1921)von Laue (1921) or Wolfgang Pauli (1921).Pauli (1921) For instance, equations of motion and acceleration transformations were developed in the papers of Hendrik Antoon Lorentz (1899, 1904), Henri Poincar√© (1905), Albert Einstein (1905), Max Planck (1906), and four-acceleration, proper acceleration, hyperbolic motion, accelerating reference frames, Born rigidity, have been analyzed by Einstein (1907), Hermann Minkowski (1907, 1908), Max Born (1909), Gustav Herglotz (1909), Arnold Sommerfeld (1910), von Laue (1911), Friedrich Kottler (1912, 1914), see section on history. Three- acceleration In accordance with both Newtonian mechanics and SR, three- acceleration or coordinate acceleration \\\\mathbf{a}=\\\\left(a_{x},\\\\ a_{y},\\\\ a_{z}\\\\right) is the first derivative of velocity \\\\mathbf{u}=\\\\left(u_{x},\\\\ u_{y},\\\\ u_{z}\\\\right) with respect to coordinate time or the second derivative of the location \\\\mathbf{r}=\\\\left(x,\\\\ y,\\\\ z\\\\right) with respect to coordinate time: :\\\\mathbf{a}=\\\\frac{d\\\\mathbf{u}}{dt}=\\\\frac{d^{2}\\\\mathbf{r}}{dt^{2}}. However, the theories sharply differ in their predictions in terms of the relation between three-accelerations measured in different inertial frames. In Newtonian mechanics, time is absolute by t'=t in accordance with the Galilean transformation, therefore the three-acceleration derived from it is equal too in all inertial frames:Sexl & Schmidt (1979), p. 116 :\\\\mathbf{a}=\\\\mathbf{a}'. On the contrary in SR, both \\\\mathbf{r} and t depend on the Lorentz transformation, therefore also three-acceleration \\\\mathbf{a} and its components vary in different inertial frames. When the relative velocity between the frames is directed in the x-direction by v=v_{x} with \\\\gamma_{v}=1/\\\\sqrt{1-v^{2}/c^{2}} as Lorentz factor, the Lorentz transformation has the form or for arbitrary velocities \\\\mathbf{v}=\\\\left(v_{x},\\\\ v_{y},\\\\ v_{z}\\\\right) of magnitude \\\\mathbf{v}=v:M√∏ller (1955), p. 41 \\\\left(\\\\gamma_{v}-1\\\\right)-t\\\\gamma_{v}\\\\right]\\\\\\\\\\\\ t^{\\\\prime} & =\\\\gamma_{v}\\\\left(t-\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{r\\\\cdot v}}{c^2}\\\\right) \\\\end{align} & \\\\begin{align}\\\\mathbf{r} & =\\\\mathbf{r}'+\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r'\\\\cdot v}\\\\right)}{v^{2}}\\\\left(\\\\gamma_{v}-1\\\\right)+t'\\\\gamma_{v}\\\\right]\\\\\\\\\\\\ t & =\\\\gamma_{v}\\\\left(t'+\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{r'\\\\cdot v}}{c^2}\\\\right) \\\\end{align} \\\\end{array}}} In order to find out the transformation of three-acceleration, one has to differentiate the spatial coordinates \\\\mathbf{r} and \\\\mathbf{r}' of the Lorentz transformation with respect to t and t', from which the transformation of three-velocity (also called velocity-addition formula) between \\\\mathbf{u} and \\\\mathbf{u}' follows, and eventually by another differentiation with respect to t and t' the transformation of three- acceleration between \\\\mathbf{a} and \\\\mathbf{a}' follows.

As with the velocity addition formulas, also these acceleration transformations guarantee that the resultant speed of the accelerated object can never reach or surpass the speed of light. Four-acceleration If four- vectors are used instead of three-vectors, namely \\\\mathbf{R} as four-position and \\\\mathbf{U} as four-velocity, then the four-acceleration \\\\mathbf{A}=\\\\left(A_{t},\\\\ A_{x},\\\\ A_{y},\\\\ A_{z}\\\\right)=\\\\left(A_{t},\\\\ \\\\mathbf{A}_{r}\\\\right) of an object is obtained by differentiation with respect to proper time \\\\mathbf{\\\\tau} instead of coordinate time:Pauli (1921), p. 627Freund (2008), pp. 267-268Ashtekar & Petkov (2014), p. 53 {d\\\\tau}=\\\\frac{d^{2}\\\\mathbf{R}}{d\\\\tau^{2}}=\\\\left(c\\\\frac{d^{2}t}{d\\\\tau^{2}},\\\\ \\\\frac{d^{2}\\\\mathbf{r}}{d\\\\tau^{2}}\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\ & =\\\\left(\\\\gamma^{4}\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{a}}{c},\\\\ \\\\gamma^{4}\\\\frac{(\\\\mathbf{a}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{u})\\\\mathbf{u}}{c^{2}}+\\\\gamma^{2}\\\\mathbf{a}\\\\right) \\\\end{align} }} where \\\\mathbf{a} is the object's three-acceleration and \\\\mathbf{u} its momentary three-velocity of magnitude \\\\mathbf{u}=u with the corresponding Lorentz factor \\\\gamma=1/\\\\sqrt{1-u^{2}/c^{2}}. If only the spatial part is considered, and when the velocity is directed in the x-direction by u=u_{x} and only accelerations parallel (x-direction) or perpendicular (y-, z-direction) to the velocity are considered, the expression is reduced to:Sexl & Schmidt (1979), p. 198, Solution to example 16.1Ferraro (2007), p. 178 :\\\\mathbf{A}_{r}=\\\\mathbf{a}\\\\left(\\\\gamma^{4},\\\\ \\\\gamma^{2},\\\\ \\\\gamma^{2}\\\\right) Unlike the three-acceleration previously discussed, it is not necessary to derive a new transformation for four-acceleration, because as with all four-vectors, the components of \\\\mathbf{A} in two inertial frames with relative speed v are connected by a Lorentz transformation. Thus replacing x,\\\\ y,\\\\ z,\\\\ ct by A_{x},\\\\ A_{y},\\\\ A_{z},\\\\ A_{t} in () gives:Sexl & Schmidt (1979), p. 121 :\\\\begin{array}{cc} \\\\begin{align}A_{x}^{\\\\prime} & =\\\\gamma_{v}\\\\left(A_{x}-\\\\frac{v}{c}A_{t}\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\ A_{y}^{\\\\prime} & =A_{y}\\\\\\\\\\\\ A_{z}^{\\\\prime} & =A_{z}\\\\\\\\\\\\ A_{t}^{\\\\prime} & =\\\\gamma_{v}\\\\left(A_{t}-\\\\frac{v}{c}A_{x}\\\\right) \\\\end{align} & \\\\begin{align}A_{x} & =\\\\gamma_{v}\\\\left(A_{x}^{\\\\prime}+\\\\frac{v}{c}A_{t}^{\\\\prime}\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\ A_{y} & =A_{y}^{\\\\prime}\\\\\\\\\\\\ A_{z} & =A_{z}^{\\\\prime}\\\\\\\\\\\\ A_{t} & =\\\\gamma_{v}\\\\left(A_{t}^{\\\\prime}+\\\\frac{v}{c}A_{x}^{\\\\prime}\\\\right) \\\\end{align} \\\\end{array} or replacing \\\\mathbf{r},\\\\ ct by \\\\mathbf{A}_{r},\\\\ A_{t} in () gives the transformation at arbitrary relative velocity \\\\mathbf{v}: :\\\\begin{array}{cc} \\\\begin{align}\\\\mathbf{A}{}_{r}^{\\\\prime} & =\\\\mathbf{A}_{r}+\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{v}}{c}\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{A}_{r}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\right)c}{v^{2}}\\\\left(\\\\gamma_{v}-1\\\\right)-A_{t}\\\\gamma_{v}\\\\right]\\\\\\\\\\\\ A_{t}^{\\\\prime} & =\\\\gamma_{v}\\\\left(A_{t}-\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{A}_{r}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{v}}{c}\\\\right) \\\\end{align} & \\\\begin{align}\\\\mathbf{A}_{r} & =\\\\mathbf{A}{}_{r}^{\\\\prime}+\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{v}}{c}\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{A}{}_{r}^{\\\\prime}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\right)c}{v^{2}}\\\\left(\\\\gamma_{v}-1\\\\right)+A_{t}^{\\\\prime}\\\\gamma_{v}\\\\right]\\\\\\\\\\\\ A_{t} & =\\\\gamma_{v}\\\\left(A_{t}^{\\\\prime}+\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{A}{}_{r}^{\\\\prime}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{v}}{c}\\\\right) \\\\end{align} \\\\end{array}, On the other hand, the inner product \\\\mathbf{A}^{2}=-A_{t}^{2}+\\\\mathbf{A}_{r}^{2} with metric signature and consequently its magnitude \\\\mathbf{A}=\\\\sqrt{\\\\mathbf{A}^{2}} is invariant, thus:Kopeikin & Efroimsky & Kaplan (2011), p. 137 {c}\\\\right)^{2}\\\\right]}.}} Proper acceleration In infinitesimal small durations there is always one inertial frame, which momentarily has the same velocity as the accelerated body, and in which the Lorentz transformation holds. The corresponding three- acceleration \\\\mathbf{a}^{0}=\\\\left(a_{x}^{0},\\\\ a_{y}^{0},\\\\ a_{z}^{0}\\\\right) in these frames can be directly measured by an accelerometer, and is called proper accelerationRindler (1977), pp. 49-50 or rest acceleration.von Laue (1921), pp. 88-89 The relation of \\\\mathbf{a}^{0} in a momentary inertial frame S' and \\\\mathbf{a} measured in an external inertial frame S follows from (, ) with \\\\mathbf{a}'=\\\\mathbf{a}^{0}, \\\\mathbf{u}'=0, \\\\mathbf{u}=\\\\mathbf{v} and \\\\gamma=\\\\gamma_{v}. So in terms of (), when the velocity is directed in the x-direction by u=u_{x}=v=v_{x} and when only accelerations parallel (x-direction) or perpendicular (y-, z-direction) to the velocity are considered, it follows: {\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{u^{2}}{c^{2}}\\\\right)^{3/2}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{y}^{0} & =\\\\frac{a_{y}}{1-\\\\frac{u^{2}}{c^{2}}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{z}^{0} & =\\\\frac{a_{z}}{1-\\\\frac{u^{2}}{c^{2}}} \\\\end{align} & \\\\begin{align}a_{x} & =a_{x}^{0}\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{u^{2}}{c^{2}}\\\\right)^{3/2}\\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{y} & =a_{y}^{0}\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{u^{2}}{c^{2}}\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{z} & =a_{z}^{0}\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{u^{2}}{c^{2}}\\\\right) \\\\end{align} & \\\\text{or} & \\\\begin{align}\\\\mathbf{a}^{0} & =\\\\mathbf{a}\\\\left(\\\\gamma^{3},\\\\ \\\\gamma^{2},\\\\ \\\\gamma^{2}\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{a} & =\\\\mathbf{\\\\mathbf{a}}^{0}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\gamma^{3}},\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\gamma^{2}},\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\gamma^{2}}\\\\right) \\\\end{align} \\\\end{array}}} Generalized by () for arbitrary directions of \\\\mathbf{u} of magnitude \\\\mathbf{u}=u:Rebhan (1999), p. 775Nikoliƒá (2000), eq. 10 :\\\\begin{align}\\\\mathbf{a}^{0} & =\\\\gamma^{2}\\\\left[\\\\mathbf{a}+\\\\frac{(\\\\mathbf{a}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{u})\\\\mathbf{u}}{u^{2}}\\\\left(\\\\gamma-1\\\\right)\\\\right]\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{a} & =\\\\frac{1}{\\\\gamma^{2}}\\\\left[\\\\mathbf{a}^{0}-\\\\frac{(\\\\mathbf{a}^{0}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{u})\\\\mathbf{u}}{u^{2}}\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{\\\\gamma}\\\\right)\\\\right] \\\\end{align} There is also a close relationship to the magnitude of four- acceleration: As it is invariant, it can be determined in the momentary inertial frame S', in which \\\\mathbf{A}_{r}^{\\\\prime}=\\\\mathbf{a}^{0} and by dt'/d\\\\tau=1 it follows d^{2}t'/d\\\\tau^{2}=A_{t}^{\\\\prime}=0:Rindler (1977), p. 67 =\\\\mathbf{a}^{0}.}} Thus the magnitude of four-acceleration corresponds to the magnitude of proper acceleration. By combining this with (), an alternative method for the determination of the connection between \\\\mathbf{a}^{0} in S' and \\\\mathbf{a} in S is given, namely :\\\\mathbf{a}^{0}=\\\\mathbf{A}=\\\\sqrt{\\\\gamma^{4}\\\\left[\\\\mathbf{a}^{2}+\\\\gamma^{2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{a}}{c}\\\\right)^{2}\\\\right]} from which () follows again when the velocity is directed in the x-direction by u=u_{x} and only accelerations parallel (x-direction) or perpendicular (y-, z-direction) to the velocity are considered.

It follows from (, ) by setting \\\\mathbf{f}'=\\\\mathbf{f}^{0} and \\\\mathbf{u}'=0 as well as \\\\mathbf{u}=\\\\mathbf{v} and \\\\gamma=\\\\gamma_{v}. Thus by () where only accelerations parallel (x-direction) or perpendicular (y-, z-direction) to the velocity u=u_{x}=v=v_{x} are considered: {\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{u^{2}}{c^{2}}}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ f_{z}^{0} & =\\\\frac{f_{z}}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{u^{2}}{c^{2}}}} \\\\end{align} & \\\\begin{align}f_{x} & =f_{x}^{0}\\\\\\\\\\\\ f_{y} & =f_{y}^{0}\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{u^{2}}{c^{2}}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ f_{z} & =f_{z}^{0}\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{u^{2}}{c^{2}}} \\\\end{align} & \\\\text{or} & \\\\begin{align}\\\\mathbf{f}^{0} & =\\\\mathbf{f}\\\\left(1,\\\\ \\\\gamma,\\\\ \\\\gamma\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{f} & =\\\\mathbf{f}^{0}\\\\left(1,\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\gamma},\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\gamma}\\\\right) \\\\end{align} \\\\end{array}}} Generalized by () for arbitrary directions of \\\\mathbf{u} of magnitude \\\\mathbf{u}=u:M√∏ller (1955), p. 74Rebhan (1999), p. 818 :\\\\begin{align}\\\\mathbf{f}^{0} & =\\\\mathbf{f}\\\\gamma-\\\\frac{(\\\\mathbf{f}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{u})\\\\mathbf{u}}{u^{2}}(\\\\gamma-1)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{f} & =\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{f}^{0}}{\\\\gamma}+\\\\frac{(\\\\mathbf{f}^{0}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{u})\\\\mathbf{u}}{u^{2}}\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{\\\\gamma}\\\\right) \\\\end{align} Since in momentary inertial frames one has \\\\gamma=1, the Newtonian relation \\\\mathbf{f}^{0}=m\\\\mathbf{a}^{0} holds (which also follows from the above relation \\\\mathbf{F}=m\\\\mathbf{A}, since in the momentary rest frame one has \\\\mathbf{F}=\\\\mathbf{f}^{0} and \\\\mathbf{A}=\\\\mathbf{a}^{0}), therefore (, , ) can be summarizedsee Lorentz's 1904-equations and Einstein's 1905-equations in section on history By that, the apparent contradiction in the historical definitions of transverse mass m_{\\\\perp} can be explained.Mathpages (see external links), \\"Transverse Mass in Einstein's Electrodynamics\\", eq. 2,3 Einstein (1905) described the relation between three-acceleration and proper force :m_{\\\\perp\\\\ \\\\mathrm{Einstein}}=\\\\frac{f_{y}^{0}}{a_{y}}=\\\\frac{f_{z}^{0}}{a_{z}}=m\\\\gamma^{2}, while Lorentz (1899, 1904) and Planck (1906) described the relation between three-acceleration and three-force :m_{\\\\perp\\\\ \\\\mathrm{Lorentz}}=\\\\frac{f_{y}}{a_{y}}=\\\\frac{f_{z}}{a_{z}}=m\\\\gamma. Curved world lines By integration of the equations of motion one obtains the curved world lines of accelerated bodies corresponding to a sequence of momentary inertial frames (here, the expression \\"curved\\" is related to the form of the worldlines in Minkowski diagrams, which should not be confused with \\"curved\\" spacetime of general relativity). In connection with this, the so-called clock hypothesis of clock postulate has to be considered:Rindler (1977), p. 43Koks (2006), section 7.1 The proper time of comoving clocks is independent of acceleration, that is, the time dilation of these clocks as seen in an external inertial frame only depends on its relative velocity with respect to that frame. Two simple cases of curved world lines are now provided by integration of equation () for proper acceleration: a) Hyperbolic motion: The constant, longitudinal proper acceleration \\\\alpha=a_{x}^{0}=a_{x}\\\\gamma^{3} by () leads to the world lineFraundorf (2012), section IV-BPhysicsFAQ (2016), see external links. {\\\\alpha}\\\\left(\\\\cosh\\\\frac{\\\\alpha\\\\tau}{c}-1\\\\right),\\\\quad y=0,\\\\quad z=0,\\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\tau(t)=\\\\frac{c}{\\\\alpha}\\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{1+\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\alpha t}{c}\\\\right)^{2}}+\\\\frac{\\\\alpha t}{c}\\\\right),\\\\quad x(t)=\\\\frac{c^{2}}{\\\\alpha}\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{1+\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\alpha t}{c}\\\\right)^{2}}-1\\\\right) \\\\end{align} }} The worldline corresponds to the hyperbolic equation c^{4}/\\\\alpha^{2}=\\\\left(x+c^{2}/\\\\alpha\\\\right)^{2}-c^{2}t^{2}, from which the name hyperbolic motion is derived. These equations are often used for the calculation of various scenarios of the twin paradox or Bell's spaceship paradox, or in relation to space travel using constant acceleration. b) The constant, transverse proper acceleration a_{y}^{0}=a_{y}\\\\gamma^{2} by () can be seen as a centripetal acceleration, leading to the worldline of a body in uniform rotationPauri & Vallisneri (2000), eq. 13Bini & Lusanna & Mashhoon (2005), eq. 28,29 :\\\\begin{align}x & =r\\\\cos\\\\Omega_{0}t=r\\\\cos\\\\Omega\\\\tau\\\\\\\\\\\\ y & =r\\\\sin\\\\Omega_{0}t=r\\\\sin\\\\Omega\\\\tau\\\\\\\\\\\\ z & =z\\\\\\\\\\\\ t & =\\\\gamma\\\\tau=\\\\frac{\\\\tau}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\left(\\\\frac{r\\\\Omega_{0}}{c}\\\\right)^{2}}}=\\\\tau\\\\sqrt{1+\\\\left(\\\\frac{r\\\\Omega}{c}\\\\right)^{2}} \\\\end{align} where v=r\\\\Omega_{0} is the tangential speed, r is the orbital radius, \\\\Omega_{0} is the angular velocity as a function of coordinate time, and \\\\Omega=\\\\gamma\\\\Omega_{0} as the proper angular velocity. A classification of curved worldlines can be obtained by using the differential geometry of triple curves, which can be expressed by spacetime Frenet-Serret formulas.Synge (1966) In particular, it can be shown that hyperbolic motion and uniform circular motion are special cases of motions having constant curvatures and torsions,Pauri & Vallisneri (2000), Appendix A satisfying the condition of Born rigidity. A body is called Born rigid if the spacetime distance between its infinitesimally separated worldlines or points remains constant during acceleration. Accelerated reference frames Instead of inertial frames, these accelerated motions and curved worldlines can also be described using accelerated or curvilinear coordinates. The proper reference frame established that way is closely related to Fermi coordinates.Misner & Thorne & Wheeler (1973), Section 6Gourgoulhon (2013), entire book For instance, the coordinates for an hyperbolically accelerated reference frame are sometimes called Rindler coordinates, or those of a uniformly rotating reference frame are called rotating cylindrical coordinates (or sometimes Born coordinates). In terms of the equivalence principle, the effects arising in these accelerated frames are analogous to effects in a homogeneous, fictitious gravitational field. In this way it can be seen, that the employment of accelerating frames in SR produces important mathematical relations, which (when further developed) play a fundamental role in the description of real, inhomogeneous gravitational fields in terms of curved spacetime in general relativity. History For further information see von Laue, Pauli, Miller,Miller (1981) Zahar,Zahar (1989) Gourgoulhon, and the historical sources in history of special relativity. ;1899: Hendrik Lorentz derived the correct (up to a certain factor \\\\epsilon) relations for accelerations, forces and masses between a resting electrostatic systems of particles S_{0} (in a stationary aether), and a system S emerging from it by adding a translation, with k as the Lorentz factor: ::\\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon^{2}}, \\\\frac{1}{k\\\\epsilon^{2}}, \\\\frac{1}{k\\\\epsilon^{2}} for \\\\mathbf{f}/\\\\mathbf{f}^{0} by (); ::\\\\frac{1}{k^{3}\\\\epsilon}, \\\\frac{1}{k^{2}\\\\epsilon}, \\\\frac{1}{k^{2}\\\\epsilon} for \\\\mathbf{a}/\\\\mathbf{a}^{0} by (); ::\\\\frac{k^{3}}{\\\\epsilon}, \\\\frac{k}{\\\\epsilon}, \\\\frac{k}{\\\\epsilon} for \\\\mathbf{f}/(m\\\\mathbf{a}), thus longitudinal and transverse mass by (); :Lorentz explained that he has no means of determining the value of \\\\epsilon. If he had set \\\\epsilon=1, his expressions would have assumed the exact relativistic form. ;1904: Lorentz derived the previous relations in a more detailed way, namely with respect to the properties of particles resting in the system \\\\Sigma' and the moving system \\\\Sigma, with the new auxiliary variable l equal to 1/\\\\epsilon compared to the one in 1899, thus: ::\\\\mathfrak{F}(\\\\Sigma)=\\\\left(l^{2},\\\\ \\\\frac{l^{2}}{k},\\\\ \\\\frac{l^{2}}{k}\\\\right)\\\\mathfrak{F}(\\\\Sigma') for \\\\mathbf{f} as a function of \\\\mathbf{f}^{0} by (); ::m\\\\mathfrak{j}(\\\\Sigma)=\\\\left(l^{2},\\\\ \\\\frac{l^{2}}{k},\\\\ \\\\frac{l^{2}}{k}\\\\right)m\\\\mathfrak{j}(\\\\Sigma') for m\\\\mathbf{a} as a function of m\\\\mathbf{a}^{0} by (); ::\\\\mathfrak{j}(\\\\Sigma)=\\\\left(\\\\frac{l}{k^{3}},\\\\ \\\\frac{l}{k^{2}},\\\\ \\\\frac{l}{k^{2}}\\\\right)\\\\mathfrak{j}(\\\\Sigma') for \\\\mathbf{a} as a function of \\\\mathbf{a}^{0} by (); ::m(\\\\Sigma)=\\\\left(k^{3}l,\\\\ kl,\\\\ kl\\\\right)m(\\\\Sigma') for longitudinal and transverse mass as a function of the rest mass by (, ). :This time, Lorentz could show that l=1, by which his formulas assume the exact relativistic form. He also formulated the equation of motion ::{\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathfrak{F}=\\\\frac{d\\\\mathfrak{G}}{dt}} with {\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathfrak{G}=\\\\frac{e^{2}}{6\\\\pi c^{2}R}kl\\\\mathfrak{w}} :which corresponds to () with \\\\mathbf{f}=\\\\frac{d\\\\mathbf{p}}{dt}=\\\\frac{d(m\\\\gamma\\\\mathbf{u})}{dt}, with l=1, \\\\mathfrak{F}=\\\\mathbf{f}, \\\\mathfrak{G}=\\\\mathbf{p}, \\\\mathfrak{w}=\\\\mathbf{u}, k=\\\\gamma, and e^{2}/(6\\\\pi c^{2}R)=m as electromagnetic rest mass. Furthermore, he argued, that these formulas should not only hold for forces and masses of electrically charged particles, but for other processes as well so that the earth's motion through the aether remains undetectable. ;1905: Henri Poincar√© introduced the transformation of three-force (): ::X_{1}^{\\\\prime}=\\\\frac{k}{l^{3}}\\\\frac{\\\\rho}{\\\\rho^{\\\\prime}}\\\\left(X_{1}+\\\\epsilon\\\\Sigma X_{1}\\\\xi\\\\right),\\\\quad Y_{1}^{\\\\prime}=\\\\frac{\\\\rho}{\\\\rho^{\\\\prime}}\\\\frac{Y_{1}}{l^{3}},\\\\quad Z_{1}^{\\\\prime}=\\\\frac{\\\\rho}{\\\\rho^{\\\\prime}}\\\\frac{Z_{1}}{l^{3}} :with \\\\frac{\\\\rho}{\\\\rho^{\\\\prime}}=\\\\frac{k}{l^{3}}(1+\\\\epsilon\\\\xi), and k as the Lorentz factor, \\\\rho the charge density. Or in modern notation: \\\\epsilon=v, \\\\xi=u_{x}, \\\\left(X_{1},\\\\ Y_{1},\\\\ Z_{1}\\\\right)=\\\\mathbf{f}, and \\\\Sigma X_{1}\\\\xi=\\\\mathbf{f}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{u}. As Lorentz, he set l=1. ;1905: Albert Einstein derived the equations of motions on the basis of his special theory of relativity, which represent the relation between equally valid inertial frames without the action of a mechanical aether. Einstein concluded, that in a momentary inertial frame k the equations of motion retain their Newtonian form: ::\\\\mu\\\\frac{d^{2}\\\\xi}{d\\\\tau^{2}}=\\\\epsilon X',\\\\quad\\\\mu\\\\frac{d^{2}\\\\eta}{d\\\\tau^{2}}=\\\\epsilon Y',\\\\quad\\\\mu\\\\frac{d^{2}\\\\zeta}{d\\\\tau^{2}}=\\\\epsilon Z'. :This corresponds to \\\\mathbf{f}^{0}=m\\\\mathbf{a}^{0}, because \\\\mu=m and \\\\left(\\\\frac{d^{2}\\\\xi}{d\\\\tau^{2}},\\\\ \\\\frac{d^{2}\\\\eta}{d\\\\tau^{2}},\\\\ \\\\frac{d^{2}\\\\zeta}{d\\\\tau^{2}}\\\\right)=\\\\mathbf{a}^{0} and \\\\left(\\\\epsilon X',\\\\ \\\\epsilon Y',\\\\ \\\\epsilon Z'\\\\right)=\\\\mathbf{f}^{0}. By transformation into a relatively moving system K he obtained the equations for the electrical and magnetic components observed in that frame: ::\\\\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}=\\\\frac{\\\\epsilon}{\\\\mu}\\\\frac{1}{\\\\beta^{3}}X,\\\\quad\\\\frac{d^{2}y}{dt^{2}}=\\\\frac{\\\\epsilon}{\\\\mu}\\\\frac{1}{\\\\beta}\\\\left(Y-\\\\frac{v}{V}N\\\\right),\\\\quad\\\\frac{d^{2}z}{dt^{2}}=\\\\frac{\\\\epsilon}{\\\\mu}\\\\frac{1}{\\\\beta}\\\\left(Z+\\\\frac{v}{V}M\\\\right). :This corresponds to () with \\\\mathbf{a}=\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{f}}{m}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\gamma^{3}},\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\gamma},\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\gamma}\\\\right), because \\\\mu=m and \\\\left(\\\\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}},\\\\ \\\\frac{d^{2}y}{dt^{2}},\\\\ \\\\frac{d^{2}z}{dt^{2}}\\\\right)=\\\\mathbf{a} and \\\\left[\\\\epsilon X,\\\\ \\\\epsilon\\\\left(Y-\\\\frac{v}{V}N\\\\right),\\\\ \\\\epsilon\\\\left(Z+\\\\frac{v}{V}M\\\\right)\\\\right]=\\\\mathbf{f} and \\\\beta=\\\\gamma. Consequently, Einstein determined the longitudinal and transverse mass, even though he related it to the force \\\\left(\\\\epsilon X',\\\\ \\\\epsilon Y',\\\\ \\\\epsilon Z'\\\\right)=\\\\mathbf{f}^{0} in the momentary rest frame measured by a comoving spring balance, and to the three-acceleration \\\\mathbf{a} in system K: ::\\\\begin{array}{cc} \\\\begin{align}\\\\mu\\\\beta^{3}\\\\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}} & =\\\\epsilon X=\\\\epsilon X'\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mu\\\\beta^{2}\\\\frac{d^{2}y}{dt^{2}} & =\\\\epsilon\\\\beta\\\\left(Y-\\\\frac{v}{V}N\\\\right)=\\\\epsilon Y'\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mu\\\\beta^{2}\\\\frac{d^{2}z}{dt^{2}} & =\\\\epsilon\\\\beta\\\\left(Z+\\\\frac{v}{V}M\\\\right)=\\\\epsilon Z' \\\\end{align} & \\\\begin{align}\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\left(\\\\frac{v}{V}\\\\right)^{2}}\\\\right)^{3}} & \\\\ \\\\text{longitudinal mass}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\mu}{1-\\\\left(\\\\frac{v}{V}\\\\right)^{2}} & \\\\ \\\\text{transverse mass} \\\\end{align} \\\\end{array} :This corresponds to () with m\\\\mathbf{a}\\\\left(\\\\gamma^{3},\\\\ \\\\gamma^{2},\\\\ \\\\gamma^{2}\\\\right)=\\\\mathbf{f}\\\\left(1,\\\\ \\\\gamma,\\\\ \\\\gamma\\\\right)=\\\\mathbf{f}^{0}. ;1905: Poincar√© introduces the transformation of three-acceleration (): ::\\\\frac{d\\\\xi^{\\\\prime}}{dt^{\\\\prime}}=\\\\frac{d\\\\xi}{dt}\\\\frac{1}{k^{3}\\\\mu^{3}},\\\\quad\\\\frac{d\\\\eta^{\\\\prime}}{dt^{\\\\prime}}=\\\\frac{d\\\\eta}{dt}\\\\frac{1}{k^{2}\\\\mu^{2}}-\\\\frac{d\\\\xi}{dt}\\\\frac{\\\\eta\\\\epsilon}{k^{2}\\\\mu^{3}},\\\\quad\\\\frac{d\\\\zeta^{\\\\prime}}{dt^{\\\\prime}}=\\\\frac{d\\\\zeta}{dt}\\\\frac{1}{k^{2}\\\\mu^{2}}-\\\\frac{d\\\\xi}{dt}\\\\frac{\\\\zeta\\\\epsilon}{k^{2}\\\\mu^{3}} :where \\\\left(\\\\xi,\\\\ \\\\eta,\\\\ \\\\zeta\\\\right)=\\\\mathbf{u} as well as k=\\\\gamma and \\\\epsilon=v and \\\\mu=1+\\\\xi\\\\epsilon=1+u_{x}v. :Furthermore, he introduced the four-force in the form: ::k_{0}X_{1},\\\\quad k_{0}Y_{1},\\\\quad k_{0}Z_{1},\\\\quad k_{0}T_{1} :where k_{0}=\\\\gamma_{0} and \\\\left(X_{1},\\\\ Y_{1},\\\\ Z_{1}\\\\right)=\\\\mathbf{f} and T_{1}=\\\\Sigma X_{1}\\\\xi=\\\\mathbf{f}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{u}. ;1906: Max Planck derived the equation of motion ::\\\\frac{m\\\\ddot{x}}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{q^{2}}{c^{2}}}}=e\\\\mathfrak{E}_{x}-\\\\frac{e\\\\dot{x}}{c^{2}}\\\\left(\\\\dot{x}\\\\mathfrak{E}_{x}+\\\\dot{y}\\\\mathfrak{E}_{y}+\\\\dot{z}\\\\mathfrak{E}_{z}\\\\right)+\\\\frac{e}{c}\\\\left(\\\\dot{y}\\\\mathfrak{H}_{z}-\\\\dot{z}\\\\mathfrak{H}_{y}\\\\right)\\\\ \\\\text{etc.} :with ::e\\\\left(\\\\dot{x}\\\\mathfrak{E}_{x}+\\\\dot{y}\\\\mathfrak{E}_{y}+\\\\dot{z}\\\\mathfrak{E}_{z}\\\\right)=\\\\frac{m\\\\left(\\\\dot{x}\\\\ddot{x}+\\\\dot{y}\\\\ddot{y}+\\\\dot{z}\\\\ddot{z}\\\\right)}{\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{q^{2}}{c^{2}}\\\\right)^{3/2}} and e\\\\mathfrak{E}_{x}+\\\\frac{e}{c}\\\\left(\\\\dot{y}\\\\mathfrak{H}_{z}-\\\\dot{z}\\\\mathfrak{H}_{y}\\\\right)=X\\\\ \\\\text{etc.} :and ::\\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{m\\\\dot{x}}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{q^{2}}{c^{2}}}}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} =X\\\\ \\\\text{etc.} :The equations correspond to () with ::\\\\mathbf{f}=\\\\frac{d\\\\mathbf{p}}{dt}=\\\\frac{d(m\\\\gamma\\\\mathbf{u})}{dt}=m\\\\gamma^{3}\\\\left(\\\\frac{(\\\\mathbf{a}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{u})\\\\mathbf{u}}{c^{2}}\\\\right)+m\\\\gamma\\\\mathbf{a}, with X=f_{x} and q=v and \\\\dot{x}\\\\ddot{x}+\\\\dot{y}\\\\ddot{y}+\\\\dot{z}\\\\ddot{z}=\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{a}, in agreement with those given by Lorentz (1904). ;1907: Einstein analyzed a uniformly accelerated reference frame and obtained formulas for coordinate dependent time dilation and speed of light, analogous to those given by Kottler-M√∏ller-Rindler coordinates. ;1907: Hermann Minkowski defined the relation between the four-force (which he called the moving force) and the four acceleration ::m\\\\frac{d}{d\\\\tau}\\\\frac{dx}{d\\\\tau}=R_{x},\\\\quad m\\\\frac{d}{d\\\\tau}\\\\frac{dy}{d\\\\tau}=R_{y},\\\\quad m\\\\frac{d}{d\\\\tau}\\\\frac{dz}{d\\\\tau}=R_{z},\\\\quad m\\\\frac{d}{d\\\\tau}\\\\frac{dt}{d\\\\tau}=R_{t} :corresponding to m\\\\mathbf{A}=\\\\mathbf{F}. ;1908: Minkowski denotes the second derivative x,y,z,t with respect to proper time as \\"acceleration vector\\" (four-acceleration). He showed, that its magnitude at an arbitrary point P of the worldline is c^{2}/\\\\varrho, where \\\\varrho is the magnitude of a vector directed from the center of the corresponding \\"curvature hyperbola\\" () to P. ;1909: Max Born denotes the motion with constant magnitude of Minkowski's acceleration vector as \\"hyperbolic motion\\" (), in the course of his study of rigidly accelerated motion. He set p=dx/d\\\\tau (now called proper velocity) and q=-dt/d\\\\tau=\\\\sqrt{1+p^{2}/c^{2}} as Lorentz factor and \\\\tau as proper time, with the transformation equations ::x=-q\\\\xi,\\\\quad y=\\\\eta,\\\\quad z=\\\\zeta,\\\\quad t=\\\\frac{p}{c^{2}}\\\\xi. :which corresponds to () with \\\\xi=c^{2}/\\\\alpha and p=c\\\\sinh(\\\\alpha\\\\tau/c). Eliminating p Born derived the hyperbolic equation x^{2}-c^{2}t^{2}=\\\\xi^{2}, and defined the magnitude of acceleration as b=c^{2}/\\\\xi. He also noticed that his transformation can be used to transform into a \\"hyperbolically accelerated reference system\\" (). ;1909: Gustav Herglotz extends Born's investigation to all possible cases of rigidly accelerated motion, including uniform rotation. ;1910: Arnold Sommerfeld brought Born's formulas for hyperbolic motion in a more concise form with l=ict as the imaginary time variable and \\\\varphi as an imaginary angle: ::x=r\\\\cos\\\\varphi,\\\\quad y=y',\\\\quad z=z',\\\\quad l=r\\\\sin\\\\varphi :He noted that when r,y,z are variable and \\\\varphi is constant, they describe the worldline of a charged body in hyperbolic motion. But if r,y,z are constant and \\\\varphi is variable, they denote the transformation into its rest frame. ;1911: Sommerfeld explicitly used the expression \\"proper acceleration\\" () for the quantity \\\\dot{v}_{0} in \\\\dot{v}=\\\\dot{v}_{0}\\\\left(1-\\\\beta^{2}\\\\right)^{3/2}, which corresponds to (), as the acceleration in the momentary inertial frame. ;1911: Herglotz explicitly used the expression \\"rest acceleration\\" () instead of proper acceleration. He wrote it in the form \\\\gamma_{l}^{0}=\\\\beta^{3}\\\\gamma_{l} and \\\\gamma_{t}^{0}=\\\\beta^{2}\\\\gamma_{t} which corresponds to (), where \\\\beta is the Lorentz factor and \\\\gamma_{l}^{0} or \\\\gamma_{t}^{0} are the longitudinal and transverse components of rest acceleration. ;1911: Max von Laue derived in the first edition of his monograph \\"Das Relativit√§tsprinzip\\" the transformation for three-acceleration by differentiation of the velocity addition ::\\\\begin{align}\\\\mathfrak{\\\\dot{q}}_{x} & =\\\\left(\\\\frac{c\\\\sqrt{c^{2}-v^{2}}}{c^{2}+v\\\\mathfrak{q}_{x}^{\\\\prime}}\\\\right)^{3}\\\\mathfrak{\\\\dot{q}}_{x}^{\\\\prime}, & \\\\mathfrak{\\\\dot{q}}_{y} & =\\\\left(\\\\frac{c\\\\sqrt{c^{2}-v^{2}}}{c^{2}+v\\\\mathfrak{q}_{x}^{\\\\prime}}\\\\right)^{2}\\\\left(\\\\mathfrak{\\\\dot{q}}_{x}^{\\\\prime}-\\\\frac{v\\\\mathfrak{q}_{y}^{\\\\prime}\\\\mathfrak{\\\\dot{q}}_{x}^{\\\\prime}}{c^{2}+v\\\\mathfrak{q}_{x}^{\\\\prime}}\\\\right),\\\\end{align} :equivalent to () as well as to Poincar√© (1905/6). From that he derived the transformation of rest acceleration (equivalent to ), and eventually the formulas for hyperbolic motion which corresponds to (): ::\\\\pm\\\\mathfrak{q}_{x}=\\\\pm\\\\frac{dx}{dt}=\\\\frac{cbt}{\\\\sqrt{c^{2}+b^{2}t^{2}}},\\\\quad\\\\pm\\\\left(x-x_{0}\\\\right)=\\\\frac{c}{b}\\\\sqrt{c^{2}+b^{2}t^{2}}, :thus ::x^{2}-c^{2}t^{2}=x^{2}-u^{2}=c^{4}/b^{2},\\\\quad y=\\\\eta,\\\\quad z=\\\\zeta, :and the transformation into a hyperbolic reference system with imaginary angle \\\\varphi: ::\\\\begin{array}{cc} \\\\begin{align}X & =R\\\\cos\\\\varphi\\\\\\\\\\\\ L & =R\\\\sin\\\\varphi \\\\end{align} & \\\\begin{align}R^{2} & =X^{2}+L^{2}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\tan\\\\varphi & =\\\\frac{L}{X} \\\\end{align} \\\\end{array}. :He also wrote the transformation of three-force as ::\\\\begin{align}\\\\mathfrak{K}_{x} & =\\\\frac{\\\\mathfrak{K}_{x}^{\\\\prime}+\\\\frac{v}{c^{2}}(\\\\mathfrak{q'K'})}{1+\\\\frac{v\\\\mathfrak{q}_{x}^{\\\\prime}}{c^{2}}}, & \\\\mathfrak{K}_{y} & =\\\\mathfrak{K}_{y}^{\\\\prime}\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\beta^{2}}}{1+\\\\frac{v\\\\mathfrak{q}_{x}^{\\\\prime}}{c^{2}}}, & \\\\mathfrak{K}_{z} & =\\\\mathfrak{K}_{z}^{\\\\prime}\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\beta^{2}}}{1+\\\\frac{v\\\\mathfrak{q}_{x}^{\\\\prime}}{c^{2}}},\\\\end{align} :equivalent to () as well as to Poincar√© (1905). ;1912‚Äì1914: Friedrich Kottler obtained general covariance of Maxwell's equations, and used four-dimensional Frenet-Serret formulas to analyze the Born rigid motions given by Herglotz (1909). He also obtained the proper reference frames for hyperbolic motion and uniform circular motion. ;1913: von Laue replaced in the second edition of his book the transformation of three-acceleration by Minkowski's acceleration vector for which he coined the name \\"four-acceleration\\" (), defined by \\\\dot{Y}=\\\\frac{dY}{d\\\\tau} with Y as four-velocity. He showed, that the magnitude of four-acceleration corresponds to the rest acceleration \\\\dot{\\\\mathfrak{q}}^{0} by ::\\\\dot{Y}=\\\\frac{1}{c}\\\\dot{\\\\mathfrak{q}}^{0}, :which corresponds to (). Subsequently, he derived the same formulas as in 1911 for the transformation of rest acceleration and hyperbolic motion, and the hyperbolic reference frame.

He worked for 25 years in Egypt and Sudan, serving from 1914 to 1926 as Director of Education in the Sudan, before accepting an invitation to become Director of the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem. Origins, education and early career John Winter Crowfoot was the eldest of three children, and the only son, of clergyman John Henchman Crowfoot (1841‚Äì1927) and his wife Mary (n√©e Bayly). A Fellow of Jesus College, Oxford and later the Chancellor of Lincoln Cathedral, John Henchman lived with his wife Mary in Lincoln for most of their married life, retiring to Worthing before World War I. By tradition, the Crowfoots were a medical family. Between 1783 and 1907 they provided five generations of surgeons and doctors to the market town of Beccles in Suffolk.Ashworth P. Burke, Family Records (Harrison and Sons, London, 1897), at pages 194‚Äì195 John's uncles William Miller Crowfoot (1837‚Äì1918) and Edward Bowles Crowfoot (1845‚Äì1897) were doctors in Beccles, as was his cousin William Bayly Crowfoot (1878‚Äì1907). In 1921 John and his wife Molly leased a house at Geldeston, near Beccles, which became the family home for the next sixty years. John was educated at the Fauconberge SchoolE.A. Goodwyn, The Fauconberge School, Beccles, 1770‚Äì1926, 1980. before entering Marlborough College and then Brasenose College, Oxford, where he read Greats and was Senior Hulme Exhibitioner in 1896.Brasenose College Register 1509‚Äì1909 (B.H. Blackwell, Oxford, 1909), Volume 1, at page 703 On graduating Crowfoot studied from 1896 to 1897 at the British School at Athens. He excavated at the site of Hala Sultan Tekke in Cyprus in 1898, on behalf of the British Museum.√Östr√∂m, Paul, Bailey, Donald M. and Karageorghis, Vassos 1976. Hala Sultan Tekke 1.

Lacking private means or other funding to continue an archaeological career, John accepted an appointment in 1899 as lecturer in Classics at Birmingham University, the first \\"red-brick university\\" to gain a royal charter in the United Kingdom. Sudan and Egypt In 1901 John went to Egypt, to take up a post as Assistant Master at a school founded in Cairo by the late Tewfik Pasha. Between 1903 and 1908 he served as Assistant Director of Education and Acting Conservator of Antiquities for the Government of Sudan, before being appointed in 1908 as Inspector at the Ministry of Education in Cairo. John Crowfoot with Sudanese notablesDuring his first period in Sudan John Crowfoot became acquainted with Babikr Bedri, a former soldier of the Mahdi. Colonial officials warned Bedri that his intention to set up the first modern school for girls in Sudan would be \\"under your own name and at your own expense\\".The Memoirs of Babikr Bedri, Vol 2, Ithaca Press, London, 1980, p. 136 onwards. John Crowfoot made a personal donation of ¬£10 towards the costs. The school opened in 1907. In the early 20th century the colonial authorities in Sudan still feared a further eruption of Mahdism. As a consequence the region was under quasi-military rule. There were no European women in the country and any man recruited to work in Sudan had to provide assurances that he was not only unmarried but also without a fianc√©e. In 1909 after John moved to Cairo he was able to marry Grace Mary Hood (Molly), whom he had met in Lincoln years before. She joined him in Egypt and over the next four years their daughters Dorothy, Joan and Elisabeth were born in Cairo. In 1916, on the recommendation of Lord Kitchener, Crowfoot returned to the Sudan as the Director of Education and Principal of Gordon College, Khartoum.M.W. Daly, Empire on the Nile: the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, 1898‚Äì1934 (Cambridge University Press, 1986), at page 248. He was now accompanied by his wife Molly. John Crowfoot served, at the same time, as Director of the Department of Antiquities of the Sudan. In 1919, Crowfoot was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for wartime services in the Sudan,London Gazette, 5 December 1919, p.15052 which included monitoring shipping in the Red Sea. Government attitudes towards the provision of educational opportunities to the Sudanese hardened over time, particularly after political disturbances in 1924. Crowfoot, \\"who despite a lack of forcefulness was an educational administrator of long experience\\", decided to claim the pension to which he was already entitled and resigned in 1926.M.W. Daly, op. cit., p. 380. Palestine That same year, still in his early fifties, John Crowfoot succeeded John Garstang as Director of the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem. This enabled him and his wife Molly, at long last, to engage in archaeology full-time. He retained the directorship until his retirement in 1935.S.G. Rosenberg, \\"British Groundbreakers in the Archaeology of the Holy Land\\", Minerva, January/February 2008. Between 1928 and 1930 John Crowfoot directed the BSAJ-Yale University excavation of more than a dozen 5th- and 6th-century Christian churches at Jerash (Gerasa) in Trans-Jordan. This broke with the prevailing \\"obsession\\" with the Old Testament among archaeologists in Palestine and their desire \\"to prove it true\\". Under his guidance there was a shift to examining what survived of early Christian archaeology, which was \\"rich in architecture, art, epigraphy and the classical roots of Western society\\" (R.W. Hamilton). From 1931 to 1935 John Crowfoot directed the Joint Expedition of the BSAJ, PEF, Harvard University and the Hebrew University at Samaria-Sebaste. These excavations made it possible to reconstruct the \\"dramatically changing fortunes\\" of this provincial capital of Omri and his son Ahab through twenty centuries, with the successive cultural contributions of Assyrians, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines and Crusaders. Three large volumes of the findings from this site were published, between 1938 and 1957. In the words of the Palestine Exploration Fund, \\"Crowfoot's work in this period was of the greatest importance for Levantine archaeology, with major contributions to the understanding of the Iron Age ceramic sequence, the eastern terra sigillata, and pioneering work on early churches\\". From 1945 to 1950 John Crowfoot was Chairman of the Palestine Exploration Fund. Family and retirement John Crowfoot married Grace Mary (\\"Molly\\"), daughter of Sinclair Frankland Hood, of Nettleham Hall, Lincolnshire, in 1909.Burke's Landed Gentry, 13th edition, Burke's Peerage Ltd, 1921, p. 920, Hood of Nettlesham Hall pedigree A botanist and fine draughtswoman, she became a distinguished scholar in her own right, an authority on archaeological textiles, and served as an equal partner in many of his professional activities.See \\"Grace Mary Crowfoot\\", Breaking Ground: Women in Old World Archaeology, 2004, download pdf. Their nephew (son of Molly's brother, Lt-Cmdr Martin Hood, RN) was the archaeologist Sinclair Hood.https://www.aegeussociety.org/en/wanderings/home-of-the-heroes-an- interview-with-sinclair-hood-part-1 In the years following the end of World War II Crowfoot was an active member of the housing committee at the Loddon Rural District Council, and took pride in his successful support of the distinctive local council housing designed by the Tayler & Green partnership.Rural Housing, Prince of Wales' Trust, 2007. At varying times and in varying ways his four daughters followed their parents and also pursued archaeological interests. Joan Crowfoot Payne (1912‚Äì2002) worked for thirty years on Egyptian antiquities at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford; Elisabeth Crowfoot (1914‚Äì2005) succeeded her mother as a textile archaeologist; and Diana (b. 1918), a geographer, married Graham Rowley, the Arctic explorer and archaeologist. Their eldest daughter, Dorothy, visited her parents on site in Jerash and helped with drawings of certain mosaics there.Georgina Ferry, Dothory Hodgkin: A Life, Granta: London, 1998, pp. 38‚Äì40. Her field was chemistry and in 1947 she was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, only the third woman to have received that honour. (In 1964 Dorothy would be awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.) John Winter Crowfoot died in 1959 and is buried, with his wife Molly, next to the tower of St Michael's parish church, Geldeston.

It was the former headquarters of the Mount Vernon Seminary and the Navy Communication Security Section and other U.S. military organizations. Currently it houses the United States Department of Homeland Security. The site is located at AU Park and is bound by Nebraska and Massachusetts Avenue.  History   Facility for Department of the Navy and National Security Agency  Between 1917 and 1942, the complex housed Mount Vernon Seminary. By the end of 1942, the United States Department of the Navy took over the buildings, and formally acquired the land for $1.1 million US dollars on July 20, 1943. After they acquired the land, the area was renamed to the Communications Supplementary Annex. Between February 1943 and July 1946, the Annex housed the Communication Security Section, which was relocated from the Main Navy Department building in Washington, D.C. It changed to Navy Communications Station (also known as NAVCOMMSTA Washington (NCSW)) on July 7, 1948, and was redesignated as the Naval Security Station (NAVSECSTA) on September 21, 1950. Between June 1943 and December 1949, the Annex also housed Naval Code and Signals Laboratory. In September 1950, the Communications Security Group and the Communications Supplementary Activity Washington, merged to officially form the establishment of the Naval Security Group, headquartered at NAVSECSTA. From 1951 onwards, the Station housed Armed Forces Security Agency units and after creation of the National Security Agency (NSA) in 1952, the Station housed NSA headquarters and its Security Branch, Naval Communications Division. In 1956, NSA Security Branch, Naval Communications Division was redesigned into Naval Security Group Headquarters Activity. By 1961 it changed to Naval Security Group Headquarters, Washington D.C. and in 1968 to Naval Security Group Command, Washington D.C. In 1971 it was redesigned as Naval Security Group Command Headquarters. The Communication Security Group (COMNAVSECGRU) headquarters staff officially moved from NAVSECSTA to Fort George G. Meade in November 1995. Naval Computer and Telecommunications Command was present in the area between December 1990 and August 2001. George W. Bush visiting Nebraska Avenue Complex on 19 September 2002. On October 16, 1998 Naval Security Station officially disestablished and became the Nebraska Avenue Complex. From 1998 to 2005, the Complex was home to Naval Center for Cost Analysis, Naval District Washington Public Safety, Director of Strategic Systems Programs, Office of Civilian Personnel Management and the Navy International Programs Office.  Department of Homeland Security headquarters  In 2002, the Complex housed Office of Homeland Security, established the year prior. After it was reformed into the United States Department of Homeland Security, the Nebraska Avenue Complex became the main headquarters for the department. Since 2005, the Nebraska Avenue Complex has been owned by the General Services Administration. DHS operations were soon spread across several dozen buildings in the Washington area, however, as the Complex could only accommodate a small portion of its total staff. This prompted a search for a larger headquarters, leading to the purchase of St. Elizabeths Hospital West Campus in 2007, but as of 2019, construction and renovation was still underway, and only some personnel had been transferred.

The 1200-seat St James's Theatre on the corner with Duke Street opened in 1835, but was demolished in 1957, despite widespread protests. Notable occupiers include the principal London premises of the auctioneers Christie's, and Palamon Capital Partners.

The union was founded in 1862 in Manchester, bringing together nine local societies of tin plate workers from across Lancashire. Initially, its main aim was to help skilled tin plate workers find employment. However, it grew rapidly, and from 1871, it began offering welfare services, including pensions, and payments to unemployed members, and to the families of members who died. It accepted only members who had completed an apprenticeship in the trade, and charged older members higher joining fees.Arthur Marsh and Victoria Ryan, Historical Directory of Trade Unions, vol.2, pp.110, 120 By 1876, the union was based in Liverpool, and most of its membership were connected with shipbuilding. It opposed piece work, largely because the jobs done by its members were too varied to construct a single agreed price list.Sidney and Beatrice Webb, Industrial Democracy, p.300 In 1892, the union changed its name to the General Union of Braziers and Sheet Metal Workers and, the following year, was successful enough to make its post of secretary a full-time one. It joined the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades in 1897, and the National Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers' and Braziers' Society in 1900. It merged with National Amalgamated Association of Tin Plate Workers of Great Britain and a large number of local unions in 1920 to form the National Union of Sheet Metal Workers and Braziers.

He taught and did research at Stanford University from 1893 to 1927.  Life  Henry Rushton Fairclough, son of James Fairclough and Elizabeth Erving Fairclough, attended the Collegiate Institute and studied classical philology at the University of Toronto. After obtaining his bachelor's degree, he became a fellow at the University College there, and taught Latin, Greek, and English at the high school in Brockville from 1884 to 1885. From 1885 to 1886 he completed graduate school and finished with a master's degree; he was subsequently appointed to be a teacher of Greek philology and classical history. In 1893 Fairclough left Canada and became an associate professor of Greek and Latin at Stanford University in California, where he spent the rest of his entire career. He intensified his studies at Johns Hopkins University, where the classical philologists Basil Lanneau Gildersleeve and Minton Warren, as well as the Sanskrit researcher Maurice Bloomfield, greatly influenced him. In 1896 Fairclough earned his PhD. A year later, in 1897, he was named professor of classical literature at Stanford University, and professor of Latin in 1902. In 1903 he undertook his first educational journey to Europe, more particularly to Italy and Greece. Fairclough accepted an invitation to be Acting Director of the American School of Classical Studies in Rome during the years 1910 and 1911. During the First World War, he served in the American Red Cross in Switzerland and in Montenegro from 1918 to 1919, for which he was awarded many distinctions. After his return to Stanford University, he was named professor of Classical Literature in 1922. In the same year, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by his alma mater. Fairclough was also a guest professor for Latin and Greek at Harvard University, and simultaneously president of the American Philological Association; as which he held an official speech titled \\"The Classics and our Twentieth-century Poets\\", which was printed in the following year. In 1927, Fairclough retired from Stanford University, but still taught as a guest professor at Amherst College until 1929. After his retirement from Stanford, the Classics program created the annual H. Rushton Fairclough Prize for excellence in scholarship in Classics.The Stanford Daily, Volume 72, Issue 4 (6 October 1927), p. 3. Fairclough's research was focused on Roman poets. He wrote translations and bilingual editions of Plautus and Terence, the works of Vergil, and the satires and epistles of Horace. Further, he published text critical and exegetical individual studies of these authors and two monographs on the Roman and Greek concept of nature. Three years after his death, his biography was published posthumously under the title \\"Warming Both Hands\\", in which he describes his career and in particular his experiences during the First World War.

She is best known for her time in Ring of Honor, where she was record three-time Women of Honor World Champion.  Professional wrestling career   Ring of Honor (2015‚Äì2019)  Klein made her debut at Ring of Honor on October 24, 2015, at Night 2 of the Glory By Honor XIV event in Dayton, Ohio, defeating Ray Lyn in one minute via submission. Klein made her televised debut on the June 26, 2016 episode of Ring of Honor Wrestling, from Nashville, Tennessee. In the main event of the first ever episode of Women of Honor, she defeated Taeler Hendrix via submission. On the December 14, 2016 episode of Ring of Honor Wrestling, the second WOH special, she faced ODB in a winning effort when ODB passed out to Klein's submission. As a heel, she went on an undefeated streak in ROH until it was ended by Karen Q with help from Deonna Purrazzo during an event in May 2017. This led to a triple threat match in July in the 3rd Women of Honor event, which Karen Q also ended up winning. Klein later defeated Purrazzo in another singles match on the July 29 tapings, with the win coming after Karen Q turned heel and attacked Purrazzo. At the 2018 Final Battle event, Klein won the Women of Honor World Championship for the first time, where she defeated the champion Sumie Sakai in a Four Corner Survival match, which also involved Madison Rayne and Karen Q. At Night 2 of Bound By Honor on February 10, 2019, she lost the title to Mayu Iwatani, ending her reign at 58 days. Klein regained the championship on April 6, 2019 at ROH's Madison Square Garden debut, the G1 Supercard, and shook hands with Iwatani afterwards, turning face in the process. Klein was attacked afterwards by the debuting Velvet Sky and Angelina Love, who were joined by Mandy Leon, with Leon turning heel by attacking Klein from behind. On November 22, 2019, it was revealed that Klein would be let go by Ring of Honor whilst recovering from post-concussion syndrome and while still the reigning Women of Honor World Champion. She previously spoke out against the company on Twitter for refusing to pay her the living wage and ROH not having a concussion protocol and not allowing her time off to heal from injury. It was these comments that reportedly led to ROH deciding not to renew her contract.  World Wonder Ring Stardom (2017‚Äì2018)  On October 14, 2017, Klein made her debut for the World Wonder Ring Stardom promotion by entering the Goddesses of Stardom Tag League tournament. She ended up winning the tournament along with Bea Priestley. Following the tournament, Klein and Bea unsuccessfully challenged Oedo Tai (Hana Kimura and Kagetsu) for the Goddess of Stardom Championship.

He was born and raised in Bogota. He graduated from the Colegio San Bartolom√© Nacional in 1916. He then went into journalism; by the age of 23, he was already an experienced journalist, working for the daily Mundo al D√≠a. He was known as a sharp observer of Bogota society. Osorio wrote for almost all the newspapers in the capital, usually under his own name but sometimes under the pseudonym El Solitario.Bio He ran a number of newspapers during his career: Diario Nacional, El Heraldo and the Barranquilla newspaper La Prensa. He also worked at S√°bado and Jornada, the latter a Gaitan-supporting newspaper. He fulfilled a number of public roles too: private secretary to the ministers of war and education, and director of publications at the Comptroller General‚Äôs office. In 1946, after parting with Jorge Eli√©cer Gait√°n, he left Colombia to begin his extensive travels across Latin America. When Gaitan was assassinated in April 1948, Osorio was living in Buenos Aires. The event drove him to write the novel El d√≠a del odio (1952), a detailed account of the days leading up to the Bogotazo. His decade-long stay in Argentina was also significant in other ways. He kept close ties with Juan Domingo Per√≥n, until the fall of the latter from power in 1955. Later on, Osorio lived in Chile and in the Dominican Republic. He was an intimate of the Dominican dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo, who ran the island nation directly from 1930 to 1952, and later on through his brother H√©ctor Bienvenido. Osorio worked at the house paper of the dictatorship, and also wrote a biography of Trujillo, titled As√≠ es Trujillo (1958). He wrote several other politically compromised books around this time. He came back to Colombia in 1961, resettling in Bogota. In the last years of his life, he finished writing the novel El camino en la sombra which won the first Esso Prize (now extinct) in 1963. In all, Osorio published two dozen books, including 11 novels, starting with his well-regarded debut novel La casa de vecindad in 1930. Three of his \\"urban novels\\" were reissued at the 2013 Feria del Libro de Bogota: La casa de vecindad (1930), Garabato (1939) and El camino en la sombra (1964). Osorio married his secretary Eri in 1945. She was 26 years his junior. They had two daughters, Mar√≠a Cristina and Sandra Marcela. He died on October 12, 1964 at the Hospital San Jos√©.

Although the Church of Scientology was initially partially exempted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from paying federal income tax, its two principal entities in the United States lost this exemption in 1957 and 1968. This action was taken because of concerns that church funds were being used for the private gain of its founder L. Ron Hubbard (according to the IRS) or due to an international psychiatric conspiracy against Scientology (according to Scientology). In the course of a 37-year dispute with the IRS, the church was reported to have used or planned to employ blackmail, burglary, criminal conspiracy, eavesdropping, espionage, falsification of records, fraud, front groups, harassment, money smuggling, obstruction of audits, political and media campaigns, tax evasion, theft, investigations of individual IRS officials and the instigation of more than 2,500 lawsuits in its efforts to get its tax exemption reinstated. A number of the church's most senior officials, including Hubbard's wife, were eventually jailed for crimes against the United States government related to the anti-IRS campaign. The IRS, for its part, carried out criminal investigations of the church and its leaders for suspected tax fraud and targeted the church as a \\"dissident group\\" during the Nixon administration. Although the church repeatedly lost in court cases heard up to the level of the Supreme Court, it undertook negotiations with the IRS from 1991 to find a settlement. In October 1993, the church and the IRS reached an agreement under which the church discontinued all of its litigation against the IRS and paid $12.5 million to settle a tax debt said to be around a billion dollars. The IRS granted 153 Scientology-related corporate entities tax exemption and the right to declare their own subordinate organizations tax-exempt in the future. The terms and circumstances of the agreement remained secret until details emerged through leaks and litigation beginning in 1997. The terms have attracted controversy for their perceived favorability toward the church, and have been described as unconstitutional by federal courts for their bestowal of privileges on Scientologists shared by no other religious group. Questions have also been raised about whether the IRS exceeded its authority by effectively overruling the Supreme Court in setting the terms of the agreement and permitting tax deductions not authorized in law. Some legal commentators have concluded that the agreement can no longer be effectively challenged in court. Early corporate structure Scientology's founder L. Ron Hubbard in 1950 L. Ron Hubbard initially incorporated Scientology in April 1952 as a for-profit entity called the Hubbard Association of Scientologists (HAS). It was not at first presented as a religion. However, in April 1953 Hubbard wrote to a colleague to canvass her views on pursuing \\"the religion angle\\" to improve Scientology's business prospects. Soon afterwards, in December 1953, he incorporated the first Church of Scientology in Camden, New Jersey.Urban (2011), p. 65 Hubbard made no secret of why he was interested in a religious approach. Jana Daniels, one of Hubbard's early followers, recalled that, among Scientologists, the move to a nominally religious status \\"was a most unpopular idea until it was explained by Mr. Hubbard that for tax reasons, a church would get a better shake.\\" On February 18, 1954, the Church of Scientology of California was incorporated by Burton Farber, a local Scientologist. It was subordinate to the Church of American Science, an entity headed by Hubbard, to which it paid a twenty percent tithe. A \\"Founding Church of Scientology\\" was also established in Washington, D.C. The HAS was dissolved the following June, and was replaced by the Hubbard Association of Scientologists International (HASI). Hubbard explained that the intention was to give Scientology \\"complete security from legal interference\\" due to \\"the constitutional guarantees of a Supreme Court ruling that no state shall take action to prevent operation of any organization concerned with the study of the human soul.\\"Urban, p. 66 The HASI would operate as the parent organization which franchised local Scientology churches or \\"orgs\\" and received ten percent of their gross income. Initial tax exemption and revocation The Founding Church of Scientology in Washington, DC The Internal Revenue Service awarded tax exemption to the California and Washington, D.C. churches in 1956 and 1957 respectively. In 1958, however, the Washington church lost its tax-exempt status on the grounds that its tenets and practices did not constitute an exclusively religious or educational activity. A key factor in the revocation of its exemption was the issue of private inurement ‚Äì the use of tax-exempt monies to benefit a non- tax-exempt individual or entity. The Court of Claims found that Hubbard and his family had profited from the Washington Church of Scientology. He had been given $108,000 over four years by the church, with the free use of a car and a private residence. His family had withdrawn thousands of dollars from the church's funds, and his wife Mary Sue had earned over $10,000 from renting property to it. Hubbard had also been tithed ten percent of the church's gross income.Atack, pp. 142-3 The church appealed to the US Court of Claims, but lost. The court ruled that Scientology was a \\"business, a profit-making organization run by Hubbard for his personal enrichment.\\" In 1959, Hubbard moved to England where he purchased Saint Hill Manor in East Sussex to serve as a family home and world headquarters of Scientology.Atack, p. 145 Over the following seven years, he tried repeatedly to establish a tax-exempt corporate vehicle in the United Kingdom by establishing multiple limited companies under the aegis of various Scientology entities and applying for non-profit status. However, the British Inland Revenue consistently refused the applications.Hubbard, L. Ron. \\"Corporate Status\\". HCO Executive Letter of 12 March 1966 The Church of Scientology of California (CSC), a fairly minor part of the Scientology corporate structure at the time, had managed to retain its tax exemption. In contrast to the Washington \\"Founding Church\\", an IRS audit concluded in 1964 that the CSC was operating for legitimate tax-exempt purposes. The IRS reconfirmed CSC's tax-exempt status.Church of Scientology of California, Petitioner v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Respondent. Docket No. 3352-78. United States Tax Court. September 24, 1984. In March 1966, Hubbard took advantage of this action by transferring the HASI's assets in the United States, the Commonwealth and South Africa to the CSC. By transferring Scientology's overseas operations to the control of the CSC, he was able to take advantage of reciprocal tax exemption agreements to ensure that Scientology could operate internationally under the tax-exempt mantle of the CSC. The \\"Founding Church\\" in Washington, D.C. had an ongoing lawsuit against the United States Government for a refund of the federal income taxes that the church had to pay following the loss of its tax exemption in 1957. The Department of Justice asked the IRS to review the tax-exempt status of the CSC and other Scientology entities, believing that the CSC's exemption was inconsistent with the earlier revocation of the Founding Church's exemption. In July 1966, the IRS sent the CSC a letter stating that the IRS proposed to revoke the tax exemption on the grounds that the CSC's income was inuring to the benefit of Scientology practitioners, that CSC was engaged in commercial activities, and that CSC was serving the private interests of L. Ron Hubbard. On July 18, 1967, the IRS officially revoked the CSC's tax exemption with retroactive effect. The Founding Church's case against the government went before the US Court of Claims in July 1969, where it argued that it should be exempted from federal income tax as it was constituted \\"exclusively for religious purposes.\\" Its argument was rejected,The Founding Church of Scientology v. The United States. No 226-61. United States Court of Claims, July 16, 1969 setting the scene for what Scientology's leadership would later characterize as a \\"war\\" with the IRS. The IRS revocation of tax exemption was, however, not total. While the California and Washington Scientology organizations lost their tax exemption over the issue of inurement and their business practices, fourteen other separately incorporated organizations in the United States gained or retained exemption despite similar concerns about their activities. The agency's approach to the other organizations was inconsistent. In a 1972 memorandum on the Church of Scientology of Florida (CSF), the IRS recommended that the CSF exemption should be revoked because it had not established that its funds were being used for charitable purposes. Despite this, no action was taken and the CSF retained its exemption. Scientology's views of taxation and the dispute with the IRS Underlying the dispute with the IRS was what a court later called Scientology's \\"scripturally based hostility to taxation\\". The hostility is derived to a large degree not from religious belief but from political ideology. For many years, Hubbard expressed strident opposition to Communism, denouncing colleagues to the FBI for supposedly being Communist infiltratorsAtack, p. 117 and claiming that the Soviets were trying to obtain his discoveries.Atack, p. 140 In 1955, Hubbard said in a manual on brain-washing that the 1909 Income Tax Law of the United States was a Communist conspiracy, even though the Russian Revolution was in 1917, and in 1956, he wrote that mankind had become so desperate that \\"he will buy almost any ideology whether it is communism or druidism. He will buy the garbage of Marx and even write it unsuspectingly into the United States Constitution under the heading of 'Income Tax.'\\"Hubbard, Professional Auditor's Bulletin no. 81, 24 April 1956 Soon after the Washington church lost its appeal against the withdrawal of tax exemption, Hubbard issued a bulletin to Scientologists urging them to campaign for radical reform of income tax in the United States on the grounds that the \\"basic principles of US income tax were taken from Das Kapital and are aimed at destroying capitalism. Unless the US ceases to co-operate with this Red push, Communism could win in America.\\"Hubbard, \\"Income Tax Reform\\", HCO Bulletin of 18 July 1959 Income tax was also a symptom of impending fascism, in Hubbard's view; in an undated note issued to Scientologists, he wrote, \\"It is highly possible that a government only enters upon individual taxation when its ability to produce service for its citizens has dropped below the point of non-existence. A government is justified only so long as it serves the people. A business goes bankrupt when it is not voluntarily contributed to. A government goes Fascist.\\"Hubbard, \\"Principles of Government\\". Undated advice note, reissued as OSA Network Order 10 In later years, he characterised income tax as an alien mind implant left over from the galactic tyrant Xenu's genocide of billions of beings on Earth 76 million years ago. In a 1968 lecture, he told Scientologists that \\"the United States just copies income tax\\", which had been used by Xenu to bring in his victims: \\"One of the mechanisms they used was to tell them to come in for an income tax investigation.\\"Hubbard, \\"Assists\\", Class VIII lecture of 3 October 1968 Hubbard said that in the last few thousand years, income tax had been used as a punishment by the alien Marcabian civilization, which \\"looks an almost exact duplicate, but is worse off than the current U.S. civilization\\".Hubbard, \\"Auditing Comm Cycles\\" (alternate title \\"Definition of an Auditor\\", Saint Hill Special Briefing Course lecture 291 (renumbered 320), 6 August 1963 The Church of Scientology has never accepted that the IRS's concerns over its finances had any legitimacy. The church argues that what it calls \\"the IRS campaign\\" was prompted by a conspiracy instigated by psychiatrists opposed to Scientology. Hubbard told Scientologists in a 1967 tape recording that Scientology's \\"enemies on this planet are less than twelve men. They are members of the Bank of England and other higher financial circles. They own and control newspaper chains, and they are, oddly enough, directors in all the mental health groups in the world which have sprung up ... [and] they control of course income tax, government finance\\".Hubbard, Ron's Journal 67. September 20, 1967 In a similar vein in October 1993, Hubbard's successor David Miscavige gave a speech to the International Association of Scientologists in which he claimed that after failing to crush Scientology in its first few years, \\"the psychs tuned to the modern day, 20th century inquisitors. The creatures of the night. That's right, the vampires. And not little vampires, but the ones who suck the blood from the whole country and so the villain of this plot came on the scene - the Internal Revenue Service.\\" He said that the IRS's chief counsel had conspired with psychiatrists and arranged for \\"arbitrary denial of tax exemption to every existing Church of Scientology in the United States\\". According to Miscavige, it was \\"an inbred trait of the IRS to hate Scientology and desire its destruction.\\"David Miscavige, Speech to the IAS, October 8, 1993. Published in International Scientology News, issue 32, 1994. Scientology's war: the 1960s and 1970s Tax evasion, money smuggling and inurement At the time that the CSC lost its tax exemption, Scientology faced controversy in multiple countries around the English- speaking world. It had been banned in the Australian states of Victoria and South Australia following a scathing report by a public inquiry. It faced pressure from the media, politicians and mental health professionals which led to further inquiries in Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the United Kingdom. Hubbard determined at the end of 1966 that he would leave these problems behind by relocating Scientology's leadership, and himself, aboard a small fleet of ships that would travel around the Mediterranean and eastern Atlantic, out of reach of governments and the media. An elite group of the most committed Scientologists ‚Äì the Sea Organization, or Sea Org ‚Äì accompanied Hubbard, crewed the ships and received training in the most advanced levels of Scientology as they were being developed by Hubbard.Wright, pp. 92‚Äì3 He resigned as President and Executive Director of the HASI, though this supposed relinquishment of management was a fiction; he continued to issue a stream of executive directives and policy instructions and managed Scientology from his ship via a worldwide telex network.Atack, p. 167 Financial support for the Sea Org was initially provided by the Hubbard Explorational Company Ltd (HEC). Hubbard held ninety-seven of the hundred issued shares. In late 1966, the Church of Scientology of California began paying $15,000 per month to the HEC, and made a one-off payment of $125,000 to one of Hubbard's Swiss bank accounts. He also ordered every Scientology organization to set up an \\"LRH Good Will Repayment Account\\" at its local bank and instructed the CSC to buy Saint Hill Manor from him. By this time, Saint Hill was enormously lucrative, taking in up to ¬£40,000 (equivalent to $110,000 at the time) a week.Atack, p. 171 The UK-registered HEC was replaced after about 18 months by the Operation and Transport Corporation, Ltd. (OTC). This entity was incorporated in Panama ‚Äì a well-known tax haven ‚Äì in February 1968 by Hubbard, his wife and Leon Steinberg, a Sea Org member who served as supercargo aboard one of Hubbard's ships.Miller, p. 291 Immediately after the trio incorporated OTC, they resigned and were replaced by three Sea Org members. Hubbard, however, remained very much in control; he held ninety-eight of the 100 issued sharesAtack, p. 177 and the US Court of Claims later found OTC to be a \\"sham corporation\\". The Sea Org had no separate corporate identity, so the activities of the Scientology fleet were carried on through a division of the Church called Flag (for \\"flagship\\"), based aboard Hubbard's flagship Apollo. Money was funnelled from the CSC to Flag, which usually relied on cash to pay its bills, with little regard for the law. When the United Kingdom introduced restrictions on currency exports in 1968, Scientologists travelling to join Flag were instructed to smuggle large amounts of cash with them. One Sea Org member, Mary Maren, later recalled: \\"They gave me about ¬£3,000 in high- denomination notes to take out to the ship. I hid it in my boots.\\" Leon Steinberg, one of OTC's three co-founders, became an adept forger; his creations were dubbed \\"Steinidocuments\\" by the Scientologists. Hubbard himself received huge sums. While ordinary Sea Org members were receiving $10 a week, Hubbard was being paid $15,000 a week (equivalent to $ today) via the HEC and other Scientology entities. When one of his Swiss bank accounts had to be closed in 1970, $1 million in cash was transferred to the Apollo.Miller, p. 300 Mike Goldstein, who was appointed Banking Officer aboard the Apollo, recalled that there \\"were drawers full of money everywhere and more than a million dollars in the safe, but no proper accounts. We paid for everything in cash and were working with three different currencies ‚Äì Spanish, Portuguese and Moroccan ‚Äì and it seemed that if anyone wanted money for something they just asked for it.\\"Miller, p. 301 Goldstein's role as banking officer was supposed to be the responsibility of OTC, which purportedly delivered banking services to Flag. However, in reality OTC had no offices, officers or employees. Flag's funds were deposited in OTC's Swiss bank accounts, on all of which Hubbard was a signatory. In 1972, Hubbard had $2 million in cash transferred from OTC's accounts to the Apollo, where it was stored in a locked file cabinet to which only his wife Mary Sue had the keys. Another vehicle for inurement was the United States Churches of Scientology Trust, described by the US Court of Claims in 1984 as \\"a bogus trust controlled by key church officials\\" including Hubbard himself as, initially, the sole trustee. It was operational from at least 1970, though it was not put on a legal footing until 1973. Three tax-exempt Scientology organizations in Michigan, Minnesota and New York joined the Washington and California churches in a June 1973 agreement to pay ten percent of their monthly incomes to the trust. Mary Sue Hubbard later replaced her husband as a lifetime trustee with the power to appoint two other trustees for two-year terms. The trust's money was held in Swiss bank accounts for the ostensible purpose of the defense of Scientology, though the US Court of Claims found little evidence that the money was actually used for that purpose. In addition, Hubbard and his wife were paid directly by the church. The couple's salary payments rose from $20,000 in 1970 to over $115,000 by 1972, and the church also paid for their lodging, food, laundry and medical services. Scientology orgs tithed an additional ten percent of their income to Hubbard. The torrent of cash being funnneled to Hubbard had the ostensible justification of \\"debt repayments\\". In 1966, an LRH Finance Committee was established with the aim of determining how much the church supposedly owed him. He told the press that he had \\"forgiven\\" a $13 million debt. The Committee appraised the Saint Hill estate as having a \\"business goodwill\\" value of ¬£2 million, though Hubbard had purchased it for less than ¬£100,000, and included in the debt personal items of expenditure such as the purchase of a yacht in 1940 ‚Äì twelve years before Scientology had been founded. Obstruction of the IRS and conspiracy to defraud When the Church of Scientology of California lost its tax exemption, it reverted to the status of a regular taxpayer. The church, however, did not accept its new status. Despite being told that it now needed to file income tax return forms, it continued to file the less informative Annual Information Returns as if it were still a tax-exempt organization. It also withheld payment of the taxes that it owed. The church adopted a range of obstructionist tactics to make it as difficult as possible for the IRS to carry out audits. Hubbard told Scientologists that he wanted to make the IRS \\"swim in circles\\". The church followed his lead by seeking to obstruct the IRS's efforts to audit the CSC's finances. The CSC's accountant, Martin Greenberg, told a meeting of Scientology officials in 1970 that he had purposefully made it difficult for the agency to audit the church. IRS agents were given at least two million documents jumbled up in a random order with the intention, according to Greenberg, of making the IRS's examiner so overwhelmed that he would give up and accept Scientology's version of the facts. When another Scientology church faced an audit in 1972, Greenberg advised staff to \\"give the IRS agent a bunch of records in a box in no semblance or order, to place the agent in a dark, small, out-or-the-way room, to refuse to give practical assistance like locating records, and to notify petitioner's Guardian Office immediately of the agent's presence.\\" The scheme proved effective, and a two-year effort by the IRS to audit the church's finances between 1971 and 1973 ended in failure. The church occasionally resorted to outright forgery. It falsified its own financial records to conceal the role of OTC, including creating fake invoices purporting to show that OTC had provided the CSC with training and consultation services. Further falsification took place in the spring of 1975 when a project was undertaken to falsify financial records aboard the Apollo in anticipation of an IRS audit. This plan, which the US Court of Claims ruled was part of a conspiracy to defraud the United States, was put into effect after church officials grew concerned that the outflow of cash from the CSC to OTC would jeopardise the CSC's tax-exempt status. Hubbard also considered using a front group, the United Churches of Florida, to \\"preserve the assets of Scientology\\" in the event that the church lost its fight with the IRS. He wrote in a 1975 memorandum, \\"We must be...prepared...to go right on operating throughout the U.S. and work until we get a straitjacket on IRS. The ultimate objective of IRS is to knock out all Scientology organizations in the U.S. on the pretext of tax. Thus newly operating under new corporate status that does not connect [with Scientology] is the obvious last-ditch effort.\\" Espionage Mary Sue Hubbard, who directed many of Scientology's espionage operations, pictured in 1957 While the church was fighting the IRS in the courts, it also mounted a sophisticated seven-year campaign of espionage against the agency and numerous other government and business organizations in the US, Canada, UK and other countries. Its methods included burglaries, electronic eavesdropping, infiltration and theft of government documents on a massive scale. The campaign was intended to bolster its effort to regain tax exemption, but ended disastrously for the church when it was exposed and led to the imprisonment of some of its most senior leaders, including Hubbard's wife Mary Sue. The church's espionage campaign was run by the Guardian Office (GO), a department of the church established by Hubbard in 1966. It took over the mission of the church's short-lived Public Investigation Section to \\"help LRH [Hubbard] investigate public matters and individuals which seem to impede human liberty so that such matters may be exposed and to furnish intelligence required in guiding the progress of Scientology.\\" He instructed its staff to target critics of Scientology and \\"start investigating them promptly for FELONIES or worse using own professionals, not outside agencies ... Start feeding lurid, blood sex crime [sic] actual evidence on the attackers to the press.\\"Atack, p. 160 He also ordered his followers to \\"bring the government and hostile philosophies or societies into a state of complete compliance with the goals of Scientology. This is done by high level ability to control, and in its absence, by low level ability to overwhelm. Introvert such agencies. Control such agencies.\\"Atack, p. 149 The GO was headed by Mary Sue Hubbard, the \\"Commodore Staff Guardian\\" (Hubbard was the \\"Commodore\\"), with Jane Kember carrying out day-to-day management as the Guardian World Wide. It employed Scientologist volunteers as agents to help it carry out intelligence operations against its targets. In April 1972 the GO developed a three-pronged strategy to target the IRS. Several intelligence operations were instigated: * Operation Search and Destroy targeted organizations and individuals providing information to the IRS. The GO would use overt or covert means to obtain information which could be used to discredit them, while avoiding any disclosure of Scientology's involvement. The GO had already obtained information on IRS informants and sought to expand its coverage. * Operation Random Harvest sought to document criminal activity on the part of the IRS. * Operation Paris aimed to identify individual IRS officials working on Scientology tax matters and investigate their background and activities. A 'plant' would be recruited to develop social and political contacts with IRS personnel. * Operation Juicy Clanger targeted tax records of prominent politicians and celebrities. Scientology operatives infiltrated the Los Angeles offices of the IRS and stole confidential files on California's governor Jerry Brown, Los Angeles' mayor Tom Bradley, the singer Frank Sinatra and the actress Doris Day, as well as attempting to steal John Wayne's tax records. The church appears to have intended to blackmail the IRS;Wright, p. 123 the operation envisaged the church pretending that it had received the stolen tax records from a whistleblower and threatening to release them to create what the plans described as \\"an additional pressure on [the IRS] to finish the audit [of Scientology tax matters] favorably\\". A number of other espionage \\"projects\\" ‚Äì subplans of wider operations against the IRS ‚Äì were also developed: * Project Horn was a plan to covertly release stolen documents without revealing the thieves' identity. The records of other taxpayers would be stolen and released along with those of the Church of Scientology. A GO operative within the IRS was instructed to steal letterheaded stationery from the agency so that letters could be forged in the name of a non-existent whistleblower supposedly responsible for the leaks. The operative did so and also stole tax records for Bob Jones University and the Unification Church.United States of America v. Mary Sue Hubbard, et al. Criminal No. 78-401. Stipulation of Evidence. October 1979 * Project Beetle Cleanup called for the theft of \\"all DC IRS files on LRH, Scientology, etc., in the Intelligence section, OIO [Office of International Operations], and SSS [Special Services Staff]\\". It ordered the placement of agents in the \\"required areas or good access developed\\". * Project Troy was aimed \\"to get prediction on future IRS actions\\" by planting a permanent bugging device in the office of the IRS Chief Counsel. Information acquired by eavesdropping would be used to brief the church's lawyers to mount defensive actions. The Internal Revenue Service Building on Constitution Avenue in Washington, D.C., which was infiltrated by Scientology agents in the 1970s In October 1974 the GO set out a plan ‚Äì Guardian Order 1361 ‚Äì to infiltrate IRS offices in Los Angeles, Washington and London, steal files on Scientology and Hubbard and develop a cover story to disguise how the information was obtained. To address a situation that it summarized as the IRS \\"persisting in its attack upon the C of S and LRH ... despite extensive legal and PR handling\\", it set out an \\"ideal scene\\" envisaging \\"[the] IRS with no false reports in their files on Scientology, uninterested in Scientology taxes, other than as a routine matter, doing their jobs and busy elsewhere with the usual red tape of a bureaucracy, with the psychotics located and their influence eliminated.\\" It called for the GO to \\"immediately get an agent into DC IRS to obtain files on LRH, Scientology, etc. in the Chief Council's [sic] office, the Special Services staff, the intelligence division, Audit Division, and any other areas.\\" The agent was to obtain \\"every single false report in every single IRS file. Once the data has been revealed, the lies can be corrected, the SPs [Suppressive Persons] isolated and handled, further PR and legal actions initiated and the IRS attack turned off.\\" Scientology operatives broke into the room in the IRS's headquarters building where staff credentials were made and created fake credentials for other operatives to use. The following month, the operatives infiltrated the office of the IRS's Chief Counsel and planted an electronic listening device to eavedrop on a meeting of senior IRS officials dealing with the church's tax affairs. They parked outside in the Smithsonian Institution's driveway and recorded the proceedings via their car's FM radio.Atack, p. 228 The GO also used the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to manipulate the IRS into making it easier for Scientology agents to steal documents. FOIA requests were made to the IRS in the belief that it would result in all of its Scientology files being collated in one place so that IRS attorneys could review them. Scientology agents could then burgle the office where they were being held and obtain them. This plan was successful, and Scientology operatives reported that they had gained access to all of the documents held by the IRS's FOIA attorney. By May 1975, the operatives had stolen more than 30,000 pages of documents, equivalent to a stack of paper high, on Scientology and the Hubbards. A key objective of the GO's campaign was to uncover the individual who Hubbard believed was responsible for the IRS \\"attack\\" on Scientology. He told his followers that the IRS's interest in Scientology was due to \\"an insane individual with insane plans\\" who was operating a \\"false reports factory.\\" He ordered the GO in June 1975 to \\"find the who back of these IRS attacks and document it for exposure plus all other items of interest. It could be IRS and the government is attacking any vocal group to pave the way for some coup by the government. Evidence as to the why of these attacks must be gotten, powerful enough to destroy the attackers when eventually used or revealed.\\" By the mid-1970s the church's senior leadership had become increasingly concerned that Hubbard himself faced possible indictment for tax evasion. He wrote a secret minute to the Guardian Office on November 26, 1975 in which he told the GO: \\"WE COUNT ON YOU GUYS TO MOW THE IRS DOWN AND WIN ACROSS THE BOARDS\\".Hubbard, \\"Program LRH Security Code Name: Power\\", November 26, 1975 A month later, the GO issued Guardian Program Order 158, \\"Early Warning System\\", ordering the establishment of a monitoring system \\"so that any situation concerning governments or courts by reason of suits is known in adequate time to take defensive actions to suddenly raise the level on LRH Personal Security very high\\". An agent was to be inserted into the IRS Office of International Operations, whose files on L. Ron and Mary Sue Hubbard and the Church of Scientology were to be obtained. At the time, Hubbard was living in seclusion in La Quinta, California to avoid possible process servers and government agents.Atack, pp. 225, 241 The GO initiated a new intelligence program against the IRS codenamed \\"Off The Hook\\" in June 1976, intended to get Scientology \\"off the hook, future threat nullified\\". It called for continued monitoring of IRS handling of Scientology tax exemption applications \\"on [Guardian Order] 1361 lines\\" ‚Äì i.e. through the use of infiltration and theft of information ‚Äì and ordered GO operatives to \\"ensure all attack preparation is completed and honed to razor sharp edge\\" in the event of any of the applications being denied. A program was also put in place to ensure \\"Founder's Protection from IRS Attack\\", requiring the \\"1361 Collection line\\" ‚Äì the burglary team ‚Äì to keep a close watch on the section of the IRS dealing with Hubbard's tax returns.United States of America v. Jane Kember, Morris Budlong. Sentencing Memorandum. United States District Court for the District of Columbia. December 16, 1980Heldt, Henning. \\"Program: Off The Hook\\". GPgmO 407, 9 June 1976. On one occasion, the GO's espionage operation was nearly discovered by a cleaning lady who interrupted a burglary team at the IRS headquarters. She became suspicious and called a security guard, but the operatives were able to satisfy him of their credentials and persuaded him to open the locked door of the office they were trying to burgle. They were not so lucky in June 1976 when a more alert security guard caught a GO operative in the building. The operative was released and a warrant was issued for his arrest, prompting the GO to move him to a safe house where he was put under a round-the-clock guard. He lived as a fugitive for eight months until he became so disgruntled by his virtual imprisonment that he escaped and went voluntarily to the FBI to make a confession.Atack, pp. 237-41 A further misfortune befell the GO in July 1977 when a case containing secret documents about its burglaries of IRS offices in Washington was accidentally left in a Los Angeles parking lot. An attorney handed it in to the IRS. The exposure of the GO's operations led to one of the largest raids conducted by the FBI up to that time. On July 7, 1977, scores of FBI agents simultaneously raided Scientology premises in Washington and Los Angeles.Wright, p. 140 The documents they seized revealed the scale of the GO's illegal activities and resulted in the imprisonment of eleven senior Scientologists, including Mary Sue Hubbard, for conspiracy against the United States.Wright, p. 172 IRS investigations of Scientology The Church of Scientology has claimed that it was targeted under President Richard Nixon's \\"enemies list\\", which cataloged over 250 organizations and individuals that the Nixon administration targeted through federal agencies including the IRS. It has pointed to a list of organizations of concern drawn up by the IRS in 1969. However, a review by the Los Angeles Times in 1978 showed that while the IRS listed the church as an organization that \\"by their very nature can be expected to ignore or wilfully violate tax or firearm statutes,\\" there was no mention of enemies or any suggestion of harassment or retaliation. It was in the context of a drive to consolidate overlapping investigations into groups that the IRS regarded as likely tax evaders. A number of investigations of Scientology were carried out by the IRS during the 1970s, notably from special intelligence units within the agency. In July 1969 the IRS established an Activist Organization Committee, later renamed the Special Service Staff (SSS), to investigate \\"dissident groups\\" for suspected breaches of tax laws. 99 organizations, including the Founding Church of Scientology, were targeted. The SSS was disbanded in 1973. Another IRS investigative body, the Intelligence Gathering and Retrieval Unit (IGRU), was established in 1973. This was responsible for gathering general intelligence unrelated to investigations of specific allegations. The information it gathered was thus very broad in scope, and often unrelated to the enforcement of tax laws. The CSC was designated a \\"tax resister\\"; papers relating to it were held in a file labeled \\"subversives\\", which contained materials only about Scientology. The IGRU was disbanded in 1975. IRS intelligence-gathering against Scientology was also managed in California through the state branch of the agency's Case Development Unit. Two special agents were responsible for gathering intelligence between 1968 and 1974 on CSC's operations and financial affairs. All three branches took an expansive view of their responsibilities in investigating Scientology. As well as filing reports on the organization's financial activities, they also collected information linking the CSC and other Scientology entities with criminal activities in various countries, including allegations of \\"homicide, blackmail, guerrilla training, break-ins, drug trafficking and the transportation of illegal firearms\\". The IRS considered imposing a 30 percent withholding tax on funds being transferred from the United States to overseas Scientology entities, but acknowledged in a March 1967 memo that this would have little effect on the main beneficiary of the transfers. It noted, \\"this would net little tax and not reach the real tax target ‚Äì Hubbard.\\" In 1984, the Los Angeles office of the IRS launched a criminal investigation of Hubbard, prompted by defectors from Scientology alleging that he had skimmed off millions of dollars from church funds. A letter was sent to Hubbard's representatives in September 1985 warning that he faced indictment for tax fraud. David Miscavige and another senior church official, Pat Broeker, were also put under investigation.Wright, p. 191 An IRS official, Marcus Owens, said that thousands of agency staff were involved in the investigations. However, according to other federal officials, the Department of Justice was unwilling to spend money on a prolonged conflict with Scientology. The investigation was called off after Hubbard died in January 1986, as it was regarded as moot by that point. The church was informed by the IRS in November 1987 that no charges would be filed against it, Miscavige or Broeker.Wright, p. 192 Scientology's war: the 1980s and 1990s David Miscavige, the current leader of the Church of Scientology The jailing of the GO's leadership led to radical changes within the Church of Scientology at the start of the 1980s, and in turn to significant changes in the church's strategy towards the IRS. The legal position of the Church and Hubbard himself ‚Äì who stayed in hiding at a ranch outside Creston, California until his death in January 1986 ‚Äì was still very precarious. To address this problem, he created an \\"All Clear Unit\\" (ACU), headed by David Miscavige, the then twenty-year-old head of the church's Commodore's Messenger Organization (CMO). Its purpose was to resolve all of the outstanding legal problems so that it would be safe for Hubbard to come out of hiding.Atack, p. 263 The ACU removed Mary Sue Hubbard from her post in 1981Atack, p. 266 and the GO itself was dissolved in 1983. Its functions were transferred to a new section, the Office of Special Affairs (OSA), under the effective control of Miscavige.Urban (2011), p. 112 One of the lines of activity that came out of the \\"All Clear\\" project was a push to resolve the dispute with the IRS. The stakes for the church were extremely high. According to Mark Rathbun, who worked with Miscavige as the church's Inspector-General, by the 1980s the IRS assessed the church's tax liability as upward of a billion dollars, at a time when Scientology's assets were only around $200 million. Paying that liability would have wiped out the church several times over. Beyond the purely financial issues, though, Miscavige and Rathbun believed that tax exemption would have significant political and legal advantages. As Rathbun notes, \\"If you have tax exemption you have religious recognition, you're treated differently in courts, there's almost some level of First Amendment immunity.\\" Rathbun was tasked with mounting a campaign intended to overwhelm the IRS on multiple fronts. This involved litigating on a massive scale, establishing front groups, applying political pressure, employing private investigators against individual IRS officials and ultimately reaching a negotiated agreement with the IRS. At the same time, the Church undertook internal changes intended to make it harder for the IRS to have visibility of its finances. Corporate reorganization During the early 1980s, the Church of Scientology underwent a major financial and organizational reshuffle at the same time that it was continuing to funnel huge amounts of money to L. Ron Hubbard. Although he had supposedly resigned from managing the church in 1966 and had no contractual relationship with it, he was still receiving millions of dollars of church money annually. The church's executive director at the time, Bill Franks, said the question was \\"always how to get more money into Hubbard's pocket and how to hide that from the IRS. There was literally cash all over the place. There would be people leaving from Florida for Europe with bags of cash on a weekly basis. There were hundreds of bank accounts.\\" Forbes magazine reported that up to 1982, at least $200 million had been gathered in Hubbard's name. To hide Hubbard's connection with the accounts, a shell corporation named the Religious Research Foundation was established in Liberia with bank accounts in Luxembourg and Liechtenstein. Franks systematically removed Hubbard's name from the accounts as signatory. He used RRF accounts as an intermediary to channel church money to Hubbard's secret bank accounts in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. By 1981, according to Franks, well over $100 million had been funnelled to Hubbard this way. In a single six-month period in 1982, a further $34 million of church money was transferred from the RRF to Hubbard.Wright, p. 180 The use of the RRF as an intermediary for channelling money to Hubbard was related to a project that the church termed the \\"Mission Corporate Category Sortout\\" (MCCS) at the start of the 1980s. According to Laurel Sullivan, a veteran Scientologist who was put in charge of it, the aim was to reshuffle Scientology's corporate structure to shield Hubbard from legal liability and conceal his income lines from the church. Larry Brennan, who oversaw the legal aspects, says that it was additionally intended to give Hubbard and the CMO full legal control over Scientology while \\"insulat[ing] both Hubbard and the CMO from any legal liability for running the organizations of Scientology by lying about the level of control they really had.\\" Brennan regarded this as fraudulent, but the church's organizational structure was so convoluted that the fraud was almost impossible for outsiders to uncover.Reitman, p. 130 At a September 1980 meeting between Scientologist lawyers and church officials, one of the attendees acknowledged in a tape-recorded conversation that the RRF \\"obviously is the classic case of inurement, if not fraud.\\"Church of Spiritual Technology v.

The church says the MCCS plans did not go ahead, but a major corporate reorganization took place regardless.Final Adverse Ruling, July 8, 1988. Coleman, E.D., Internal Revenue Service The Church of Scientology of California, which had hitherto been the \\"Mother Church\\" of Scientology, was turned into little more than a shell corporation. Its assets and responsibilities were split between a series of newly created corporations, notably including the Religious Technology Center, chaired by David Miscavige, and the closely linked Church of Spiritual Technology.Church of Spiritual Technology v. The United States. June 29, 1992. United States Claims Court, No. 581-88T The church's franchises were issued with new contracts and told to register as separate corporations under licence to the RTC. This approach was described by Lyman Spurlock, its Corporate Affairs Director, as being \\"designed to make the whole structure impregnable, especially as regards to the IRS.\\"Atack, p. 295 All Scientology organizations were effectively subordinated to the RTC. Steve Marlowe, the RTC's Inspector General, told Scientologists in a 1982 conference that \\"you have a new breed of management in the Church. They're tough, they're ruthless....They don't get muscled around by the IRS or by crazy loonies...you're playing with the winning team.\\"Atack, p. 296 The church established a new branch called the International Finance Police, managed by an International Finance Dictator, to oversee its financial affairs.Atack, p. 288 In 1987, an \\"audit task force\\" was created by Miscavige to make some sense of the church's tangled finances. Two hundred Scientologists were tasked with going through all the records in Washington and Los Angeles. One of Miscavige's secretaries, Tanja Castle, says that there was \\"a huge number of people putting together all of this information: binders and pictures, charts ... all the financial records from all the treasuries, all the way down to the lowest org.\\" The task was challenging as the church's financial records were chronically disorganized and full of gaps. According to a Scientologist who served as a church finance officer at the time, \\"there really were no books. Had anyone from the IRS come in and looked at our finances, they would never have given us any kind of exemption. Some of these orgs hadn't recorded their income, yet their members were claiming on their tax forms that they'd donated tens of thousands of dollars to Scientology, and no one could prove it. They had no records that actually gave you any idea of what a church had, or what it spent ‚Äì and I'm talking about all of the organizations all over the country.\\"Reitman, p. 167 Covert investigations In his 1959 Manual of Justice, Hubbard set out an aggressive approach for dealing with individuals who were seen as enemies of Scientology, writing: \\"People attack Scientology; I never forget it, always even the score.\\" Enemies of Scientology were to be hounded until they had either been neutralized or were forced to \\"shudder into silence\\": Hubbard told his readers: \\"Of twenty-one persons found attacking Dianetics and Scientology...eighteen of them under investigation were found to be members of the Communist Party or criminals, usually both. The smell of police or private detectives caused them to fly, to close down, to confess. Hire them and damn the cost when you need to.\\" This playbook was followed against senior officials of the IRS, who were seen as enemies. As Stacy Brooks, then a senior Scientology official, has put it, \\"What you do with an enemy is you go after them and harass them and intimidate them and try to expose their crimes until they decide to play ball with you.\\" The church hired private investigators to dig into the personal lives of IRS officials during the late 1980s and early 1990s. One investigator interviewed by The New York Times said the church had offered him $1 million to find evidence of corruption among IRS officials. Another who worked for the church for 18 months said that, among other things, he had set up a fake news bureau, infiltrated IRS conferences, investigated properties owned by IRS officials for possible violations of building codes, surreptitiously obtained internal IRS documents and attempted to seduce a female IRS official. He provided the church with the names and phone numbers of IRS agents that he felt could be blackmailed,Reitman, p. 165 had a drinking problem or were suspected of cheating on their spouses.Wright, p. 226 Tenants in apartments owned by IRS officials found private investigators knocking on their doors and making allegations about their landlords. The campaign put significant pressure on the targeted officials. As one put it, it was \\"blatant harassment\\". He had experienced harassment from the Scientologists since the 1970s: \\"They have a nasty habit of finding your unlisted telephone number and calling you at two A.M., just to let you know they're there.\\"Reitman, p. 166 Other IRS officials experienced unusual occurrences. The garden hoses of one assistant commissioner were repeatedly turned on at night by parties unknown, while others found their dogs and cats going missing. Whether or not these incidents were connected with Scientology, they contributed to the sense of menace felt by the agency's senior officials. The church justified its use of private investigators on the grounds that it needed \\"to counter lies spread by rogue Government agents\\". It cited as justification the fact that agents of the IRS Criminal Investigation Division had in turn investigated Scientology. The fruits of the church's investigations were publicized by its fake news bureau and in the pages of the church's Freedom magazine, which it handed out on the steps of the IRS building in Washington. In an internal magazine, it told its members: Front groups and political pressure Front groups played a high-profile role in the church's campaign to attack the IRS and put it under political pressure. It also mounted a public campaign of its own against the agency. In 1985, the church established a group called the National Coalition of IRS Whistle-Blowers, which it funded for nearly a decade. It was created by Stacy Brooks while she was the managing editor of the church's magazine Freedom. She told the New York Times that the idea was \\"to create a coalition that was at arm's length from Scientology so that it had more credibility.\\" The church recruited a retired IRS agent named Paul DesFosses, who left the agency in acrimonious circumstances in 1984, to head the coalition. It provided him with support and investigative assistance to find examples of wrongdoing in the IRS. The coalition's biggest success came in 1989 when its investigations prompted a congressional inquiry into allegations of wrongdoing by IRS staff in Los Angeles. The group claimed to have 5,000 members who were said to be mostly current and former IRS employees. Scientologists affiliated with the coalition demonstrated outside the IRS offices in Washington in 1990 and offered a $10,000 reward for information on \\"IRS abuses,\\" but attracted little interest. A second front group was Citizens for an Alternative Tax System (CATS). It was headed by Steven L. Hayes, a prominent Scientologist, to promote L. Ron Hubbard's idea of a national retail sales tax to replace the federal income tax and make the IRS redundant. According to Vic Krohn, a veteran Scientologist and former Guardian Office member who served as the first Executive Director of CATS, it was a project of the church's Office of Special Affairs. It was created by \\"a special unit dedicated to keeping the churches open under increasing IRS pressure\\" but its connections with the church had to be deniable. As Krohn puts it, \\"In order to meet the corporate requirements (IRS provisos making substantial political activity a disqualifying factor for church tax-exempt status) for such blatant political/economic reform activity, CATS needed to operate independently of the church. It was a constant battle to keep CATS activity off of OSA social reform lines.\\" Hayes duly denied that the Church of Scientology had any role in CATS other than helping to establish it, but Krohn says that the church was still directing its affairs as late as 1993. CATS gained political support from conservatives, claimed to have 3,000 members, and published glossy advertisements paid for by the International Association of Scientologists. However, its ties to Scientology proved toxic for its longer-term success and deterred potential allies. Its proposals were adopted instead by another conservative organization, Americans for Fair Taxation, which campaigned to promote a sales tax \\"without the taint of Scientologist involvement\\". CATS's signature proposal was rebranded the \\"FairTax\\" and was eventually adopted by prominent Republican politicians including John McCain and Fred Thompson. CATS itself withered after 1993 and by 2005 it was virtually defunct. The church also mounted an overt political campaign against the IRS. Its magazine Freedom published anti-IRS stories under headlines such as \\"Speaking Out Against IRS Abuses\\". It drew on IRS documents obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests to publish numerous stories attacking the agency. In 1990, David Miscavige wrote an op-ed article for USA Today calling for the abolition of the IRS and the introduction of a value added tax to replace income tax. The church spent around $6 million on full- page advertisements in USA Today and The Wall Street Journal castigating the IRS under headlines like \\"Don't Kill My Daddy!\\" and singled out individual IRS officials for condemnation. Scientology operatives were deployed on Capitol Hill to feed anti-IRS information to congressional aides. One former operative says that she had spent over a year working on the Hill to highlight the way that the IRS had handled taxpayers ranging from the Amish to small business owners. Her connection with Scientology was not a secret, but she aimed to \\"get people to come forward and show that there were attacks on other members of the public, not just on Scientology.\\"Reitman, p. 164 The church used IRS documents to argue that it had been unfairly targeted. It made much use of one memorandum from the 1970s documenting a meeting of IRS officials which Rathbun has dubbed the \\"Final Solution\\" conference, at which the IRS considered the possibility of changing its definition of a religion to exclude Scientology. Rathbun comments, \\"We used that [memo] I don't know how many times on them\\". Scientology was not without allies in its struggle with the IRS. A ruling against the church in 1980 had supported the agency's contention that it could withhold or revoke tax exemption from a body that violated \\"public policy,\\" such as civil or criminal statutes. The same principle was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1982 when it revoked the tax exemption of Bob Jones University over that body's policies of racial discrimination. Other religious groups, including the National Council of Churches, lent their support to Scientology over concerns that the IRS's approach could result in religious freedom being curtailed through denying exemption to bodies with which the government disagreed on policy grounds. Religious makeover To buttress its case against the IRS, Scientology underwent what the Los Angeles Times called a \\"sweeping religious makeover\\". Hubbard issued a directive ordering Scientology organizations to display religious paraphernalia such as crosses and copies of the \\"Creed\\" of Scientology, hold \\"Sunday services\\" and establish chapels in their buildings. He declared: \\"Visual evidences that Scientology is a religion are mandatory.\\" Scientology auditors, previously known as counselors, were renamed \\"ministers\\" and instructed to wear white collars, dark suits and silver crosses.Urban, p. 163 Similarly, customers were renamed \\"parishioners\\" and franchises were renamed \\"missions\\".Urban, p. 167 The changes were unwelcome for many Scientologists, who were used to an entirely secular environment, and raised worries among staff members that the overt display of religiosity would drive people away.Urban, p. 164 The church also engaged with academics specializing in the study of religion, in an effort to bolster its contention that Scientology was a bona fide religion. A number of religious scholars were courted and given carefully controlled access to church facilities and suitably coached members, and testified on behalf of the church in court.Wright, p. 227 Further litigation In September 1984, the US Tax Court issued a 222-page judgement upholding the IRS's revocation of the CSC's tax exemption. The court rejected the church's claims that it had been unfairly targeted and ruled that Scientology was substantially operated for commercial purposes, that its income inured to L. Ron Hubbard and others, and that the church \\"had the illegal purpose of conspiring to impede the IRS from collecting taxes due... and, thus, its activities, dictated at the highest level, violated well defined public policy.\\" It drew extensively on the incriminating documents seized by the FBI from the Guardian Office and concluded, \\"When a religious organization loses track of its charitable mission and conducts its operations for profit or private gain, the reasons for the exemption are dispelled. The organization no longer serves the public benefit.\\" The decision was a disaster for the church, which appealed unsuccessfully to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court. In the late 1980s, Scientology adopted a new litigation strategy aimed at overwhelming the IRS by suing it on a massive scale. It filed about 200 lawsuits against the agency, challenging its refusal of tax exemption and seeking to obtain documents that would show misconduct by the agency. It also prompted over 2,300 individual Scientologists to sue to demand that the IRS should allow them to make tax deductions for their contributions to the church. One single Scientologist-owned law firm generated nearly 1,200 lawsuits on behalf of Scientologist clients. Characterized by Rathbun as \\"simple little cookie-cutter suits\\", many of the lawsuits became fully-fledged legal cases which resulted in court hearings. The strategy was effectively a kind of litigious denial of service attack, aimed at tying up and exhausting the IRS's legal department. A tax lawyer interviewed by the St. Petersburg Times commented: \\"It's consumed a fair amount of resources in the exempt organizations [division] over there to deal with them year after year after year.\\" The church had around 100 simultaneous lawsuits ongoing against the IRS by mid-1992. On at least one occasion, the barrage of lawsuits resulted in the IRS's litigation budget running out before the end of the year. Miscavige boasted of the effect that this had on the agency: Many Freedom of Information Act requests were also litigated when initially refused by the IRS. According to a Washington-based attorney, William C. Walsh, who litigated on the church's behalf, \\"We wanted to get to the bottom of what we felt was discrimination. And we got a lot of documents, evidence that proved it.\\" The church also sued seventeen individual IRS officials for what it claimed was a 33-year conspiracy against Scientology. The suit, filed in 1991, demanded payment of $120 million in damages. It alleged that the IRS had conducted bogus tax exemption proceedings as a cover for a criminal investigation of Scientology. According to the suit, the IRS's Los Angeles Criminal Investigation Division had used \\"mail covers, paid informants, summonses to dozens of financial institutions and church members, and infiltration of Scientology's ecclesiastical hierarchy\\" in pursuit of its investigation. Another line of litigation concerned tape recordings of Scientology officials and lawyers discussing the Mission Corporate Category Sort-out in 1980. The recordings had come to the attention of the IRS, which saw them as evidence of planned fraud, but the church sought to suppress them as protected by attorney‚Äìclient privilege. The US 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the church, finding that \\"the figures involved in MCCS admit on the tapes that they are attempting to confuse and defraud the U.S. Government\\" and the recordings were therefore not protected under attorney‚Äìclient privilege rules. The Supreme Court upheld the court's ruling and established an important legal precedent, that courts could review privileged discussions in camera to determine whether they were caught by the crime-fraud exception to attorney- client privilege. =Hernandez and Powell cases= The church's litigation over its members' tax deductions focused on the validity of IRS Revenue Ruling 78-189, a 1978 regulation providing that the \\"fixed donations\\" demanded by Scientology of its members for auditing and training sessions were not charitable contributions under the Internal Revenue Code. The payments were held to be have been made to purchase services as a commercial transaction and were therefore not deductible on Scientologists' income tax returns. This was challenged by numerous Scientologists in various jurisdictions.Eaton, Alison H. \\"Can the IRS Overrule the Supreme Court?\\" 45 Emory L.J. 987 (1996) While the Tax Court and four appeals courts ruled in favor of the IRS, three other circuits ruled against the agency in separate cases between 1984-88. Several of the cases were consolidated as Hernandez v. Commissioner, which eventually reached the Supreme Court in 1989. The Supreme Court held that the payments were indeed nondeductible. When Congress had passed the relevant legislation, it had not envisaged making quid pro quo payments deductible. Extending this to payments to Scientology would mean that payments to other church-owned institutions for things such as medical care, schooling and counseling could also be considered deductible, which had not been Congress's intention. The Court also sought to avoid the danger of entangling church and state by requiring the IRS to monitor religious activities to determine which payments were for \\"religious\\" or \\"secular\\" purposes. It ruled that the IRS's approach did not violate the Establishment or Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment. The Hernandez case left unanswered another legal question: as other religious groups could claim deductions for payments to their churches to participate in religious services (for example, Mormon tithing or Protestant \\"pew rents\\"), could Scientologists do the same? A case backed by the church, Powell v. United States, was brought by a Florida Scientologist in 1990. Although a district court ruled against the petitioner, an appellate court ruled in 1991 that the case could proceed. However, it was discontinued in late 1993 after the Church of Scientology agreed to discontinue all of its lawsuits against the IRS as part of a settlement agreement. Negotiations and the resolution of the dispute The old Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles, California, formerly the headquarters of the Church of Scientology of California Even as the dispute between the Church of Scientology and the IRS continued, attempts were made to find a negotiated agreement. Talks in 1977 came close to settling the dispute but foundered on the issues of CSC's record-keeping system, reporting obligations and its involvement in the GO's criminal campaign against the IRS. The \\"war\\" finally came to an end after an unusual meeting between Scientology's leader and the then IRS Commissioner, Fred Goldberg. According to the church, David Miscavige and Mark Rathbun, another senior church official, walked into the IRS building in Washington on a whim and requested a meeting with the commissioner. Although some reports claimed that Miscavige and Rathbun held an impromptu meeting with Goldberg that day, according to Rathbun the meeting was held a month later, after the pair had made contact with lower-level IRS officials during their walk-in visit.) Miscavige made an impassioned twenty-minute speech on Scientology's behalf, excusing the church's previous history of criminal activity and vexatious lawsuits against the IRS being as the church \\"just trying to defend ourselves\\". He told the commissioner, \\"We can just turn it off\\", referring to the lawsuits and personal attacks against IRS officials. Rathbun added, \\"Like a faucet.\\" At the meeting, Rathbun told Goldberg: \\"Let's resolve everything. This is insane. It's reached insane levels.\\" Goldberg responded positively and set up a special five-member working group, answering to his deputy commissioner John Burke, to find a solution to the dispute.Wright, p. 231 This was a highly unusual step ‚Äì only the second time in thirty years that such an approach had been taken, according to the working group's chairman ‚Äì as it bypassed the usual channels of the IRS's exempt organizations division. Rathbun characterized this as being necessary to exclude the \\"Scientology haters\\" from the review process. Over the next two years, Miscavige, Rathbun, the working group's members and Scientology tax lawyers met on a regular basis to work through the issues that stood in the way of an agreement. Rathbun recalls, \\"We pretty much commuted to D.C. ‚Äì a couple times a month for the next year, preparing and bringing boxes and boxes of documentation to answer all of the questions the IRS had.\\" A pressing concern for the church was the potential requirement to publicly disclose information about its financial dealings. The IRS agreed that it would keep secret most of the information that the church was providing. This was itself an unusual concession, and a sign, in the view of some IRS officials, that an agreement was preordained. Paul Streckfus, a former IRS official, suggests that \\"[o]nce the IRS decided to set up this rather extraordinary group, the wheels were in motion for a deal.\\" However, it may not have been as simple as that. A year into the process, Rathbun says, Although Goldberg had initiated the negotiations, he left the IRS in February 1992. Two other commissioners served over the subsequent 15 months. Rathbun says that the stalled process suddenly began moving again after the Bill Clinton administration took office, with a new Clinton-appointed commissioner, Margaret Milner Richardson, heading the IRS from May 1993. It is unclear whether or how Richardson was involved with the negotiations, although as Commissioner she would normally have to approve any large settlement. The IRS sought to resolve three key issues: had those involved in the church's criminal campaign against the US Government in the 1970s been purged? Was the church's money being used exclusively for tax exempt purposes? And following the death of L. Ron Hubbard, were any private individuals or entities profiting from church income and assets? Church representatives say they provided answers that satisfied the IRS in what was reportedly the largest application ever received by the agency, filling a collection of files long. However, the working group's tax analysts noted in writing that they were ordered by their chairman not to consider any substantive matters, such as whether the church was engaged in too much commercial activity or whether its leaders were obtaining undue private benefit. The chairman, Howard M. Schoenfeld, later acknowledged that this was an unusual move. Rathbun says that in September 1993 the two sides began exchanging settlement drafts and tax exemption was granted in the first week of October. The agreement was announced on October 13, 1993. In contrast to agreements with two other religious organizations ‚Äì the Jimmy Swaggart Ministries and Jerry Falwell's Old Time Gospel Hour ‚Äì the IRS refused to make public any of the agreement's terms or how much the Church of Scientology had paid in back taxes. It was not until December 30, 1997 that the terms of the agreement became public when they were leaked to The Wall Street Journal. The source of the leak (which was made to both The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times) was never disclosed but it possibly came from Capitol Hill, where a congressional committee had recently subpoenaed numerous IRS documents. Terms of the agreement The agreement between Scientology and the IRS comprises a 76-page document, known as a \\"closing agreement\\", which sets out the commitments and obligations of both sides. The IRS says of such agreements, quoting US Treasury Regulations, that they \\"may be entered into in any case in which there appears to be an advantage in having the case permanently and conclusively closed, or if good and sufficient reasons are shown by the taxpayer for desiring a closing agreement and it is determined by the Commissioner that the United States will sustain no disadvantage through consummation of such an agreement.\\" Under the agreement, the Church and the IRS agreed the following key terms of settlement: * The Church paid $12.5 million to cover its payroll, income and estate-tax bills for an undisclosed period prior to 1993. * All of the church's lawsuits against the IRS were dropped, and it would no longer assist any people or groups bringing lawsuits against the agency over claims prior to the settlement date of October 1, 1993. * An undisclosed sum of payroll taxes, penalties, liens and levies assessed against church entities and officials, including Miscavige, was dropped by the IRS. * The IRS also dropped its audits of thirteen Scientology organizations and agreed not to audit the church for any year prior to 1993, as well as ending litigation against the church. * The church agreed to establish a Church Tax-Compliance Committee, headed by Miscavige, that comprised \\"the largest United States Church entities, as well as those individuals who are the highest ecclesiastical or corporate authorities within the Church\\". The CTCC was responsible for overseeing the new arrangements during a seven-year transition period, reporting annually to the IRS on the application of the agreement and guaranteeing the collection of taxes owed during the first three years. The individual members of the CTCC could be fined up to $75,000 each if they failed to provide reports as agreed. If the IRS found that they were spending church funds on noncharitable purposes, the entities responsible could be fined up to $50 million. This penalty was lifted with effect from 1999.\\"Closing Agreement on Final Determination Covering Specific Matters\\". Internal Revenue Service, October 1, 1993 One hundred fifty-three \\"Scientology-related entities\\" in the United States were granted tax exemption. As well as the Religious Technology Center and the Church of Scientology International, the \\"mother church\\", they included organizations such as Narconon and Applied Scholastics that usually claim to be secular and separate from Scientology. They even included two publishing houses, Bridge Publications and Author Services Inc., that published Hubbard's wholly non- religious science fiction books.Reitman, pp. 169‚Äì70 The IRS also gave the church the right to extend the tax exemption to future branches, effectively giving the church the ability to grant itself further tax exemptions and to decide which of its activities did not need to be taxed. The agency agreed to send foreign governments a \\"Description of the Scientology Religion\\", written by the church but printed under an IRS letterhead, to inform them that the US government had found Scientology to be \\"organized and operated exclusively for religious and charitable purposes.\\" In conjunction with the agreement, a limited amount of information about church finances was released, including details of the salaries of Miscavige and other high-ranking church officials, and the disclosure that the church was making about $300 million annually from a variety of sources. Reaction to the agreement Miscavige greeted the agreement with public jubilation. He awarded Rathbun the title of \\"Kha-Khan\\", a distinction devised by Hubbard to recognize a \\"particularly brave deed\\", in acknowledgement of Rathbun's role as \\"the guy who got us tax exemption\\". On October 8, 1993, he announced the agreement to an audience of over 10,000 Scientologists from around the world gathered in the Los Angeles Sports Arena. He told them: At this point, as Rolling Stone's Janet Reitman puts it, \\"The band launched into triumphant music and the audience rose to their feet, screaming and cheering as the words \\"THE WAR IS OVER!\\" flashed on giant screens behind Miscavige's head.\\"Reitman, p. 169 Miscavige went on to tell the audience, \\"The power of our group is greater than you can imagine ... What exactly does this mean? My answer is: everything. The magnitude of this is greater than you can imagine ... The future is ours.\\"Reitman, p. 171 Behind the scenes, though, the stress of the negotiations had taken a physical and emotional toll on both Miscavige and Rathbun. According to Lawrence Wright, Miscavige attempted to strangle his stage manager at the Sports Arena when the visual effects went wrong during rehearsals for his speech.Wright, p. 233 Miscavige was furious when the media highlighted his $100,000 salary and contrasted it to the $50 a week paid to most Scientology staff members. A month later, an exhausted Rathbun temporarily defected from Scientology; he left permanently in 2004. IRS officials outside of the small working group that had negotiated the agreement expressed shock, puzzlement and dismay. The official line within the agency was that the dispute had tied up its resources for far too long and needed to be resolved. However, as was noted at the time, the IRS had won in all of the substantial cases brought against it by the church. The officials who had been dealing with Scientology's tax affairs were confident that they would ultimately win, not least because the IRS had successfully defended its position in court only a few months before the agreement was signed. Lawrence B. Gibbs, the previous IRS Commissioner, noted the extensive litigation with \\"the general uniformity of results that the service had with Scientology\\" and expressed surprise that the ultimate decision was favorable. Some speculated that the church's harassment campaign had prompted the agency to cave. A formerly high-ranking IRS official told Janet Reitman, \\"If you ask me, [Fred] Goldberg couldn't put up with the harassment like the rest of us did.\\" Robert Fink, a New York tax lawyer who reviewed the leaked agreement for The Wall Street Journal, noted that the IRS \\"normally settles on tax issues alone. What the IRS wanted was to buy peace from the Scientologists. You never see the IRS wanting to buy peace.\\" The IRS threw a veil of secrecy over the terms of the agreement, citing taxpayer privacy laws and refusing Freedom of Information Act requests for documents relating to it. While other religious organizations had been required to disclose the payment of back taxes, Scientology was not. Gibbs implicitly criticized the secrecy, saying that it was \\"even more surprising that the service made the decision without full disclosure, in light of the prior background.\\" Rathbun insists that the church's tax exemption was earned legitimately and that its tactics were within the law. In his account of how the negotiations stalled until the election of Bill Clinton, he suggests that the agreement was personally backed by the new president. He says that around 1995, the Scientologist actress Ann Archer met Clinton during a White House tour: The agreement was covered in the press when it was announced, but due to the secrecy that surrounded its terms, it was \\"a one-day story\\" at the time.Downie Jr. & Kaiser, p. 32 It prompted Doug Frantz, a journalist with The New York Times, to take a closer look at rumours that a private investigator working for Scientology had gone after IRS officials. Frantz unearthed the investigator and found other leads, eventually leading to an interview with Scientology officials that he says \\"remains the most difficult interview I've ever had.\\"Downie Jr. & Kaiser, p. 35 His story detailing the church's tactics against the IRS was eventually published on March 9, 1997, sparking further controversy about the agreement. When the text of the agreement was leaked a few months later, Miscavige complained that its publication by The Wall Street Journal constituted \\"a felony\\". Litigation and legal debate related to the agreement The agreement led to years of further litigation and legal debate. Unsuccessful attempts were made to force the IRS to release the terms of the agreement, prior to it being leaked to The Wall Street Journal. There was also litigation about whether members of other religions could avail themselves of the tax exemptions given to the Church of Scientology. The courts determined that they could not, and that there were serious Establishment Clause concerns about the agreement granting unique privileges to Scientologists. The agreement's terms were judged to be unconstitutional but were not overturned or extended to non-Scientologists. Questions were also raised about whether the IRS had exceeded its powers in granting the exemption after the Supreme Court's decision in the 1989 Hernandez case and whether the law allowed quid pro quo payments to be tax-deductible. =Tax Analysts v. Internal Revenue Service= In November 1993, only a month after the announcement of the agreement, the non-profit tax transparency organization Tax Analysts (TA) made a Freedom of Information Act request to the IRS to obtain the closing agreement. The IRS refused, prompting a lawsuit by TA. The case focused on the IRS's obligations under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). While the IRS had refused to release information about the agreement on the grounds that returns and return information are deemed confidential, TA argued that the closing agreement should be released under a different section of the IRC that allowed for the public disclosure of information submitted to the IRS by tax-exempt organizations. In court, the IRS rejected this argument and claimed that the closing agreement did not serve as the basis for the rulings granting tax exemption to Scientology. The litigation brought out many previously undisclosed details of how the IRS had handled the negotiations with the church, but did not succeed in forcing the agency to disclose the terms of the agreement. =Sklar v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue= After the agreement was leaked, a New York Orthodox Jewish couple, Michael and Martha Sklar, sought to avail themselves of the exemption granted to Scientologists to deduct eighty percent of the fees paid for \\"religious training and services\\". They made similar deductions for the early 1990s without being challenged by the IRS, but were denied deductions for 1994 and after. The Sklars sued the IRS in 1997 to resolve the matter. The centrality of the agreement to the Sklars' case led them to subpoena the document from the IRS and the Church of Scientology. The IRS refused and the subpoenas were quashed by a tax court. The agency argued that the agreement needed to be kept secret as it was \\"private taxpayer business of another taxpayer\\", and refused to corroborate any of its reported details. As neither the IRS nor the church would admit to the veracity of the leaked text of the agreement, the court was unable to enter it as evidence. The Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled against the Sklars, but said that \\"it appears to be true\\" that Scientology was receiving uniquely favorable tax benefits, in contravention of the First Amendment. Judge Barry D. Silverman asked in his opinion, \\"Why is Scientology training different from all other religious training?\\", and took the unusual step of recommending further litigation to clarify the issue. He wrote: \\"If the I.R.S. does in fact give preferential treatment to members of the Church of Scientology - allowing them a special right to claim deductions that are contrary to law and disallowed to everybody else - then the proper course of action is a lawsuit to put a stop to that policy.\\" He rejected the proposition that the exemption should be extended to other faiths, commenting: \\"The remedy is not to require the I.R.S. to let others claim the improper deduction.\\" Sklar brought a fresh lawsuit in 2001 to resolve the First Amendment question. The IRS defended its position, saying that case law was clear that religious school tuition was not tax-deductible, and allowing it generally would lead to millions of people claiming tax refunds. Sklar lost again at trial but received an initially more favorable response from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeal. Judge Kim Wardlaw said that the bottom line of the IRS's position was that the agency believed that \\"it can unconstitutionally violate the Constitution by establishing religion, by treating one religion more favorably than other religions in terms of what is allowed as deductions, and there can never be any judicial review of that.\\" Ultimately, however, the court upheld the IRS's position that the situation of the Sklars was dissimilar to that of the Scientologists. Religious tuition was held to be different from Scientology auditing. Judge Wardlaw wrote in the court's decision, \\"We... conclude that tuition and fee payments to schools that provide secular and religious education as part of one curriculum are quite different from payments to organizations that provide exclusively religious services.\\" The court took the same view on the Scientology‚ÄìIRS agreement's constitutionality as its predecessor in the 1997 case, concluding that extending an unconstitutional tax concession to others would be an unacceptable further violation of the Establishment Clause.Sklar v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue. No. 06-72961. Tax Ct. No. 395-01. December 12, 2008 Legal observers noted that the outcome of the two Sklar cases, combined with recent changes in the doctrine of standing, meant that the Scientology‚ÄìIRS agreement was now effectively unchallengeable in court. The right of ordinary taxpayers to challenge the IRS in such cases was removed by a Supreme Court decision in 2007. Josh Gerstein, who covered the case for the New York Sun, comments: \\"It now looks like the alleged unconstitutionality of the Scientologists' tax deal may be one of those government actions which cannot be remedied in the courts.\\" =Questions over IRS powers= The agreement was criticized by four former Commissioners of the IRS, Jerome Kurtz, Don Alexander, Laurence Gibbs and Sheldon Cohen. Kurtz and his colleagues wrote in May 1994 to the then Commissioner, Margaret Milner Richardson, to \\"express serious concern about the failure of the Internal Revenue Service to comment on or explain the meaning of several aspects of its settlement with the Church of Scientology\\". They questioned the IRS's decision to allow tax deductions for quid pro quo payments, despite the outcome of the Hernandez case, and argued that it cannot ignore the Supreme Court's Hernandez ruling without further explanation. As Cohen put it, \\"the facts involving the Scientology auditing payments must have changed before the IRS could justifiably ignore Hernandez\\". Alison H. Eaton suggests that the IRS's decision to effectively overrule the Supreme Court was motivated by the fear of defeat in the Powell case. If it had lost, it would have faced a choice between denying Scientologists tax deductions given to other religious groups, or allowing the deductions that the Supreme Court had disallowed in Hernandez. The latter may have been seen as the lesser of two evils. However, it has given rise to a serious constitutional problem: granting the deductions now means that Scientologists are the only religious group permitted to deduct taxes for quid pro quo payments to their church, which can be seen as unconstitutional favoritism. Eaton argues that the IRS's decision to permit deductions for Scientologists exceeded its statutory authority. The Supreme Court found that the law did not permit quid pro quo payments of the kind made by Scientologists. The IRS's 1993 regulation allowing the deductions was therefore \\"manifestly contrary to the statute\\". If the regulation were to be challenged, Eaton suggests, a reviewing court would likely come to the same conclusion as the Supreme Court and disallow the deductions. However, there appears to be little likelihood of the issue coming before a court as taxpayers do not have standing to challenge the regulation. Calls to revoke tax exemption Since the Church of Scientology gained tax exemption in 1993, there have been a number of high-profile calls for the IRS to review and potentially revoke the exemption. The calls have generally focused on the question of whether the church is operating for legitimate tax- exempt purposes. In 2011, the St. Petersburg Times published a series of articles highlighting what it called \\"Scientology's money machine\\" and the tactics used by the church to raise money. It argued that the church \\"never should have been granted tax-exempt status, and the IRS should revisit that decision. Short of that, there is more than enough public information available to justify an IRS audit to determine if a reasonable amount of proceeds are spent for tax-exempt purposes.\\" Alex Gibney, the Oscar-winning director of the film Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief, accused Scientology in 2015 of abusing its tax exemption status by harassing its critics. He highlighted alleged illegal activities carried out by the church and its use of its assets for the private benefit of David Miscavige and Tom Cruise. Writing in the Los Angeles Times, he commented that \\"it is hard to see why Americans should subsidize Scientology through its tax- exemption.\\" The actress Leah Remini, who spent many years in Scientology before leaving in 2013, said in a January 2017 interview that she would campaign for the church's tax exemption to be revoked.

She lost her vision and hearing at age five due to meningitis, and worked in the Institute for the Handicapped for the USSR Academy of Pedagogical Sciences as the world's only deafblind researcher. Skorokhodova created a number of scientific works concerning the development of education and teaching of deafblind children.  Biography  Some sources indicated incorrect information about Skorokhodova's date of birth: it was sometimes referred to 1912 or 1914. However, according to the extracts from Church records, which were found after her death, she was born in 1911 (Julian calendar). Skorokhodova was born in Bilozerka, Kherson Oblast (current-day Ukraine) in a poor peasant family. Her father was mobilized for war in 1914 and never returned, and her mother was forced to work as a housemaid for a priest. Olga began to lose her hearing when she was five years old as a result of meningitis. In 1922 after her mother's death, she was sent to a school for the blind in Odessa. In 1925, almost completely mute, Olga came to the School- Clinic for Deafblind children in Kharkiv, founded by professor Ivan A .Sokolyansky. Under his care Olga recovered speech, and she began to keep notes on self-observation. In 1947 she published her book \\"How I perceive the world\\", which aroused a great interest in the speech. This literary work was awarded the K. D. Ushynsky prize.

He has released several albums, including the debut album Ticu (2009). Riva worked at Capital FM as a DJ, and has composed music for various television shows. He has competed repeatedly in Latvia's national selection for the entrant to the Eurovision Song Contest. Since 2017, Riva hosts the TV3 show X Faktors, Latvia's version of The X Factor. Artistry Among creative inspirations, he mentions artists such as Beyonc√©, Robyn and Woody Allen. In 2015, Markus released his first single in Russian titled \\"Taty\\", the video for the single was made by director Alan Badoev. The English version of the single is called \\"Take Me Down\\" and was one of the finalist songs for the Latvian national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest. Supernova Riva is well known for his attempts to represent Latvia in the Eurovision Song Contest. He has entered the national selection for the past seven years in a row, from 2014 to 2020. In 2014, Riva entered the Latvian selection with his song \\"Lights On\\", which came eleventh in the final of the selection. In 2015, he returned with his song \\"Take Me Down\\", which went on to place second in the final, behind the eventual winner Aminata's song \\"Love Injected\\". This has been Riva's most successful entry so far, along with 2019. In 2016, Riva entered with his song \\"I Can\\", and came third in the final, however since he was in neither the top two in the jury voting or the televote, he did not reach the superfinal. In 2017, Riva sent his song \\"Dynamite\\", however he failed to qualify from Heat 2, finishing in sixth place. In 2018, Riva entered again with the song \\"This Time\\". Originally, he was said to have failed to qualify from his semi-final, however due to technical errors in the voting he would have qualified over Ritvars' song \\"Who's Counting\\", so both songs were sent through to the final. In the final, Riva placed fifth out of eight entries. In 2019, he participated in Supernova with his song \\"You Make Me So Crazy\\". Having qualified from the semi-final, he placed second out of 8 entries, behind the eventual winner Carousel's song \\"That Night\\". Along with his 2015 attempt, this is Riva's most successful entry so far. In 2020, he returned for a seventh consecutive year with the song \\"Impossible\\", co written by Aminata. Although his song was shortlisted and he was invited to audition in front of the selection panel, he was not selected to participate in the finals.

The initiative was founded in 2003 under the title Berlinale Talent Campus after the director of the Berlin International Film Festival Dieter Kosslick announced his plans to create a platform to support newcomers in film within the festival. The new title Berlinale Talents has been in place since October 2013. The platform is realised with the support of the Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media, Creative Europe - MEDIA programme of the European Union, Robert Bosch Stiftung and Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg and is coordinated by a project team under the supervision of Christine Tr√∂strum and Florian Weghorn.

An international committee selects 250 talents, inviting them to Berlin. Berlinale Talents supports the participants, who are generally in the first ten years of their career, in positioning themselves in the filmmaking industry. With experts and renowned filmmakers they can then discuss innovations and trends in the business, develop their own projects in the project labs and present them to a diverse festival public.  The Programme  Consisting of a Summit, Project labs, Studios and a programme for film critics, i.e. Talent Press, the participants can choose from up to 100 individual events to attend, many of which are open to the public.  Summit  The Summit programme of Berlinale Talents offers a range of master classes and interactive panel discussions. Approximately 35 sessions focus on an annually changing topic featuring a variety of formats and set-ups: In the ‚Äògrand format‚Äô sessions at the main theatre (HAU1), experts of international reputation give insights into their work. During the mid-scale ‚Äòatelier‚Äô sessions in HAU2 and HAU3 experienced filmmakers and the audience are invited to enter into a dialogue.  Project Labs  * The Talent Project Market (for producers and directors) offers filmmakers the chance to present their projects at the Berlinale Co-Production Market and to get in contact with producers, financers, distributors and sales agents. Two prizes are awarded within this scheme - one worth 10.000 Euros and the other 6.000 Euros. * At the Script Station Talents work closely with renowned script consultants to fine-tune their scripts, deepen their stories and bring precision and life to their pages. With the support of their mentors, the participants have the opportunity to present their projects to the other attendants. * Doc Station enables Talents to advance their work on a particular documentary project and to make improvements with the instructions of professional mentors from the genre. * In the Short Film Station Talents move the development of their short film script forward and meet with potential partners to produce their film.  Studios  * The Camera Studio (formerly Post Production Studio) passes knowledge from experts in the fields of recording, colour correction, cutting and audio mastering to selected talents, following the newest developments digital technology, cinematography and postproduction. * The Editing Studio accepts applicants (editors and directors) with a rough cut of their film. A master class, workshops and case studies held by noted editors enlighten the field of editing from different perspectives and offer the participants invaluable insight and tips into improving and strengthening the narrative structure of their future works. * In the Production Design Studio the participants learn to sharpen their skills in creating real and virtual spaces and in crafting an atmosphere to convincingly set the stories in. * The Sound Studio programme focuses on the use of sound in many aspects of the filmmaking process, ranging from designing a sound landscape to the intricacies of sound mixing, composing scores and exploring new technologies, considering the interdisciplinary cooperation with directors, writers and producers. Participants can discuss their current work with sound designers and composers, who will also give a workshop on sound design. * In the Acting Studio actors are invited to explore a wide range of training opportunities in the fields acting technique, dialogue delivery, casting and more. These rigorous workshops help Acting Studio participants to develop skills to collaborate and communicate with everyone involved in the filmmaking process. * The Market Studio (formerly Distribution Studio) examines how distributors, sales agents and producers can build their audience and marketing strategy as early as possible in the film production process. By using case studies, connecting to the European Film Market (EFM) and actively meeting filmmakers working on new film projects, participants will expand their network and examine current models of film distribution in various parts of the world.  Talent Press  Talent Press, an initiative of Berlinale Talents in collaboration with FIPRESCI and the Goethe-Institut, is a platform for young film critics and journalists from around the world to acquaint themselves with current trends in world cinema and to review films and events throughout the entire festival. Under the tutelage of prominent film critics they share their impressions and insights through their articles for the Berlinale Talents website and those of its partners - FIPRESCI and Goethe-Institut.  ‚ÄúKompagnon‚Äù Fellowship  Berlinale Talents and Perspektive Deutsches Kino have joined forces to award the inaugural ‚ÄúKompagnon‚Äù fellowship in 2017. The fellowship will be awarded annually to two directors or screenwriters residing in Germany to support their artistic and professional development. Eligible to apply are directors and screenwriters of short or feature films who were part of the last edition of Perspektive Deutsches Kino, as well as permanent residents of Germany who will participate in the ‚ÄúScript Station‚Äù, ‚ÄúDoc Station‚Äù or ‚ÄúShort Film Station‚Äù at the upcoming edition of Berlinale Talents. In addition to a stipend of 5.000 Euros (2.500 Euros for short films) for the independent development of a screenplay or project, the ‚ÄúKompagnon‚Äù also provides a mentoring programme to help strengthen the filmmakers‚Äô artistic signature, alongside professional coaching and improved industry networking opportunities.  International Talent Initiatives  While the roots of Berlinale Talents are firmly planted in Berlin new shoots of the initiative have been sprouting internationally. The Talents International editions, Talents Beirut in Lebanon, Talents Buenos Aires in Argentina, Talents Guadalajara in Mexico, Talents Durban in South Africa, Talents Sarajevo in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Talents Tokyo in Japan have the familiar structure and purpose of their German counterpart; all the while retaining a regional perspective and finding support and the necessary amenities in a locally based international film festival or film school. International Talents initiatives are supported by local partners as well as by the Goethe-Institut. Additionally, International Talent Press programmes take place in Buenos Aires, Rio, Sarajevo, Durban and Guadalajara.  Berlin Today Award  The Berlin Today Award was a short film competition open to current and former participants of the Berlinale Talent Campus. To enter the competition, filmmakers had to submit an idea for a short film project. Five of these projects got selected and were realised with the support of German production companies and the Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg. These films were then premiered at the opening of the next Berlinale Talent Campus, with one of them additionally being awarded with the Berlin Today Award.

His Royal Highness Crown Prince Frederik is the Patron of the Society. A former minister Lykke Friis chairs the Board, and the Executive Director Charlotte Flindt Pedersen carries out the daily management of the Society. The Foreign Policy Society is independent from political as well as commercial interests. The Society does not take a stand on political issues, but merely engages in debates by conveying and sharing information and contacts. The Society has around 1000 personal members and 200 members representing around 50 companies and institutions. The Society has a Youth Branch, DUS-U35, with around 200 members.  Activities  The Foreign Policy Society carries out conferences and debates, organizes study visits, issues publications and produces TV-broadcasts. The Society invites prominent Danish and foreign speakers, politicians, academics to the debates and conferences. In the course of 70 years, many prominent speakers, including George H. W.

The Society also arranges study visits to interesting countries and regions around the world. For instance, in 2016 the study visits were made to the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, the Arctic region and Cuba.  History  Ole Lippmann (on the right) receives the British Major-General R.H.Dewing, from the Allied headquarters, in front of an honorary company of resistance fighters on 5 May 1945. The man behind the Foreign Policy Society was Ole Lippmann, a member of the Danish resistance movement. In his mind, foreign policy was a matter far too important to be entrusted only to politicians and government officials. Civil society should participate in the debate on international affairs, whose involvement should take place on an informed and qualified basis. The Society was established in Copenhagen on 31 October 1946. The founders were well-known men from the resistance movement, including Ole Lippmann, Svend Truelsen, Erik Husfeldt, Ebbe Munck; politicians such as Per Federspiel and Thorkil Kristensen from the Liberal Party, Ole Bj√∏rn Kraft from the Conservative Party, and the communists Ib N√∏rlund and Peter P. Rohde. Academia was represented by, among others, professors Alf Ross and Hartvig Frisch.

Sara Spencer Washington (June 6, 1889 ‚Äì March 23, 1953) was the founder of Apex News and Hair Company and was honored at the 1939 New York World's Fair as one of the \\"Most Distinguished Businesswomen\\" for her Apex empire of beauty company, schools, and products. Washington gave back to her community, whether founding a nursing home called Apex Rest in Atlantic City, New Jersey or the Apex Golf Club, one of the first African-American owned golf courses in the nation.  Early life Sara Spencer Washington was born in Beckley, West Virginia on June 6, 1889 to Joshua and Ellen Douglass Phillips. As a girl, she attended public schools in the Beckley area before going to the Lincoln Preparatory School in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Norfolk Mission College in Norfolk, Virginia. Before starting her beauty industry, Washington studied advanced chemistry at Columbia University. In 1905, Washington began her career as a dressmaker, a profession she continued until 1913. That year, she opened her own small hairdresser shop in Atlantic City, New Jersey, despite the fact that her parents wanted her to become a school teacher.  Career  In 1919, Washington founded the Apex News and Hair Company in Atlantic City, New Jersey and began her career as a cosmetics entrepreneur. She experimented with a variety of cosmetic products, targeting the market of African American women. While Washington started with a one-room beauty shop, she was able to grow her business into an empire by working in her beauty salon during the day and canvassing for her cosmetic products at night. The Apex Beauty Products Company encompassed a variety of products, from pressing oils, hot combs, and pomades for hair to perfumes, beauty creams, and lipsticks. Washington recognized the value in the beauty industry and considered it one of the best professions to enter. She is known for saying, \\"As long as there are women in the world, there will be beauty establishments.\\" Indeed, the demand that Washington recognized surfaced in the United States. The Apex empire included eleven different beauty schools in the United States, with schools in foreign countries that specialized in teaching with her products. It is estimated that Washington's company employed nearly five hundred people in her stores across the nation, in addition to the estimated forty-five thousand sales agents who canvassed Apex beauty products as Washington had in her early days. While Washington did not pioneer the beauty industry, she emerged into the beauty market after the world had suffered from World War I and the Great Depression. She has been celebrated for coining the slogan, \\"Now is the time to plan your future by learning a depression-proof business.\\" While Washington's company started as a one-room beauty shop, it is estimated to have been worth nearly half-a-million dollars by the mid-1940s.  Legacy  In 1939, Washington was recognized for her company at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Washington's empire had expanded from the Apex Beauty Products Company to the Apex News and Hair Company, the Apex Publishing Company, which published the Apex News for Washington's estheticians and sales agents, Apex Laboratories which created her cosmetics and products, Apex Drug Company, and Apex Beauty Colleges. Washington's international recognition from her 1939 award enhanced both her business empire and the status of African American women, as her business empire had enabled her to become one of America's first black millionaires. Washington's success enabled her to give back to her community. She contributed twenty acres of farm land as a campsite for African American youth, and gave an endowment of a home for girls, supporting the educational elements of the National Youth Administration program.

Born under the British government, as daughter of colonial officer Thomas Flucker and Hannah Waldo, daughter of Samuel Waldo. Lucy joined the American Army under the Influence of Henry Knox. After their marriage, Lucy moved around with Henry and lived on the military camp. She accompanied Henry Knox until he retired from the army in 1794.  Early life and education  She was born into a wealthy family of privilege as the daughter of the Provincial Governor of Massachusetts. Lucy's father, Thomas Flucker, holding office under the British government wanted Lucy to marry someone of a higher social status. However, in June 1774, Lucy married Henry Knox. Her parents disowned her because Henry was a merchant-class suitor at the time. Her family then fled for London once Boston had fallen, and she would never see her family again.Sandham, W. (1925). \\"General Henry Knox: After Whom Knox County, Illinois, Was Named\\". Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society, 18(2), 436-439. Lucy Knox was fortunate enough to be born into a rich, Loyalist- ranked family which gave her access to homeschooled education and an extensive amount of resources at the house library. Even for a woman of elite social class, she was always regarded as someone with \\"extensive reading\\". In fact, Lucy Knox was a frequent visitor to Henry Knox's bookstore and that was where the couple first met.  Life during the American Revolutionary War  During most of the Revolutionary War, Lucy and her husband were apart. Unfortunately, unlike other officers' wives she was wasn't able to get as many visits to the war camp. The reasoning behind Lucy Knox not receiving as many visits as other officers' wives was that she had already given up all she had (her family) for this patriotic cause and therefore her husband was resistant to her visiting and witnessing all the suffering. Even though they were separated for such a long time, Lucy and Henry didn't let their love die out and were connected through letters they sent each other. Their letters at the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History. They provide a first-hand view of one of the closest people to General Washington as well as an insight into the life of a war-hero spouse.  Personal life  Lucy Flucker fell in love with a revolutionary war patriot Henry Knox, who was born into poverty in Boston in 1750. Despite her father's wish of her marrying a man with higher social status, Lucy Knox followed her own heart and fell in love with Henry while he was working at a bookstore in Boston.

Banks is known for her nursing career, as well as a later position held as superintendent for 32 years at the same training school for nurses. Specifically designed for women of color, this hospital was later renamed McClennan-Banks Memorial Hospital in her honor.  Early life and education  Anna DeCosta Banks was born on September 2, 1869, in Charleston, South Carolina. She attended Charleston Public Schools for her primary education. In 1891 she graduated from Virginia's Hampton Institute, now known as Hampton University, where she was one of the first students to earn a diploma. Afterwards, she enrolled in Hampton's Dixie Hospital of Nursing, where she was one of the school's first graduates.  Career  Banks was the first head nurse at the Hospital and Training School for Nurses in Charleston, South Carolina, located at 135 Cannon Street. This hospital was later renamed to McClennan-Banks Memorial Hospital. She became the Superintendent of Nurses, a position she held for 32 years. Throughout her career she focused on seeking more equitable health care for African Americans, caring for many impoverished African-American patients while only charging them the cost of board and medicine. Additionally, Banks wrote an article in 1899 regarding the issues African-American nurses faced for the Hampton Training School for Nurses and Dixie Hospital. At this time, segregation affected where African-American nurses were able to work. Banks stressed the need for funding and donations at various hospitals to provide practical training for African-American nurses. Meanwhile, Banks also privately worked as a visiting public-health nurse for the Ladies Benevolent Society for Charleston. She served this society for twenty-four years and as a collector interacting with black policyholders for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.  Personal life  Banks was the daughter of Samuel and Elizabeth DeCosta. She married Issiah Banks, and in 1889 she gave birth to Evangeline Banks Harrison in Hampton, Virginia. Harrison went on to become the Medical Records Librarian at McClennan-Banks Memorial Hospital, which was partly named in honor of her mother.  Legacy  When Banks died, the society gave her the tribute: \\"All ages, classes, races, called her blessed\\". Banks had such a significant effect on nursing within the state of South Carolina that the Medical University of South Carolina named a wing of their hospital after her. In 1930, Banks passed away and was known as the oldest nurse working in South Carolina at the time. In addition, the name of the Hospital and Training School for Nurses was changed to McClennan-Banks Hospital. However, this hospital closed in 1977.

For nearly a century after surrounding lots were developed, this property remained untouched because it sat atop the route of the Croton Aqueduct that has provided water to the city since 1838. The aqueduct brought water to Manhattan via the High Bridge, from there flowing through underground channels beneath St. Nicholas Avenue and Amsterdam Avenue on its way to the reservoirs of Central Park and Bryant Park. In 1979, Sugar Hill resident William A. Harris (19212011) started a community garden in an empty lot at the corner of St. Nicholas Avenue and West 153rd Street.https://quotidianhudsonriver.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/william-a- harris-3-1000.jpg A native of Bracey, Virginia, Harris relocated to New York after completing his army service during World War II. A 30-year veteran of the New York City Department of Sanitation, where he was a foreman. Harris encouraged local youths to volunteer in cleaning up the undeveloped lot. The William A. Harris Garden is a focal point for a community. As the years passed, Harris planted more and more, and the small corner soon turned into a green patch, eventually blossoming into a thriving community garden overflowing with vegetables and flowers. Currently managed by his daughters, the garden has become a community treasure. Neighbors and community members of all ages chip in to help plant, water, and care for the plants. Although the garden sits atop the city‚Äôs water supply, the water used for maintaining the garden comes through natural means by a tank that stores nearly 1,000 gallons collected from the rooftop of the adjacent Kinghaven apartment building. The tank was installed in 2011 by members and volunteers of Green Apple Corps, under the supervision of GROWNYC.http://walkharlem.org/gardens.html  See also  * Community Gardens in New York City * Community gardening in the United States References Harlem Parks in Manhattan Community gardening in New York (state) ","title":"William A.

It is part of the Teller / Palisaden medieval fortifications which are a Swiss heritage site of national significance. History The first fortification along the lake shore was the Teller, a wooden block building and wall built out in Lake Lucerne and dendrochronologically dated to 1206/07. In the late 13th or early 14th centuries the tower was built on an artificial spit which projected out into the lake as part of the defenses around Stansstad. In addition to the Schnitzturm, a defensive wall or palisade consisting of about 8,000 wooden pillars driven into the lake at a depth of about . The palisade had a channel in it, known as the Grendel, to allow boats to enter the harbor. Exactly when the tower was first built is unknown, but it appears in a 1428 chronicle of the 1315 Battle of Morgarten. According to the chronicle, during an attack of Habsburg troops from Lucerne, an enemy ship was destroyed by a mill stone launched from the tower. Despite the efforts of the defenders, the attackers broke through and Stansstad was plundered. After the 1315 attack, the defenses were strengthened with earthen and stone walls and ditches along the shore. The Schnitzturm and other defenses lost their importance after 1332 when Lucerne joined the Old Swiss Confederacy. The palisade was not repaired as the posts rotted away. After the division of Unterwalden into Obwalden and Nidwalden in the 1350s, both successor half-cantons were responsible for upkeep of the defenses at Stansstad. This arraignment proved to be problematic and by 1587 the tower had fallen into disrepair. In that year, a special Landsgemeinde decided to repair the tower. The project took about two years and completely renovated the tower. The round arch windows were added as was the current entrance on the south side at ground level. The original entrance on the second floor corner was closed off. A flat hipped roof was built on top of the tower. The roof was damaged by lightning in 1634 and only partly repaired in the following year. The interior was soon destroyed by the leaky roof and the tower began to be used to dry fishing nets. It was repaired again by Obwalden in 1736. The last military use of the tower was during the 1798 French invasion. The palisade was hastily replaced with floating fir tree trunks and the Schnitzturm was manned. They held off the French fleet for several days, but on 9 April 1798 French troops broke through on the land side and captured the town. The town and the tower were burned by the victorious soldiers. In 1880 the cantonal authorities repaired the tower, built a staircase and observation platform and readded the crenelations that existed before the 1635 roof. Castle site The grounds around the tower are open to the public year-round. From 1 May though 30 September the tower is open during daylight hours. The tower has a square footprint and is high. The walls are thick at the base.

All 3 people on board, including the only passenger, the famous Chinese poet Xu Zhimo, died in the crash. The aircraft was operated by China Airways Federal in the Republic of China and was contracted by Chunghwa Post. It departed from Ming Gugong Airport in Nanking, heading to Nanyuan Airport in Beiping (now Beijing). The passenger, Xu Zhimo, was intending to attend an architectural lecture given by the well- known architect Lin Huiyin in Beiping. Because of Xu's fame as a poet, the crash shocked the literary community in China.  Background   Xu Zhimo's schedule  Xu Zhimo Xu Zhimo was going to attend an architectural lecture in Beiping, which was given by the famous architect Lin Huiyin. It was widely believed that Xu was determined to attend the lecture because Lin was romantically related to Xu. He went to be a member of the claques for her. Although Xu was warned that the weather en route to Beiping was changeable, he insisted on flying there, since it is much faster by air and the weather had been fair before the aircraft took off.  The aircraft and pilots  The aircraft was a Stinson Detroiter SM-1F operated by China Airways Federal in the Republic of China and was contracted by Chunghwa Post. It was originally General Zhang Xueliang's private airplane, and Xu took the lift free.https://zhidao.baidu.com/question/578740862.html The aircraft was also carrying 500 lbs of mail. It had a nickname of Jinan. The captain of the flight was Wang Guanyi (Chinese: ÁéãË¥Ø‰∏Ä), and the first officer was Liang Bitang (Chinese: Ê¢ÅÁíßÂ†Ç), both 36 years old. They were experienced pilots graduated from Nanyuan Aviation School.  Crash  The Stinson Detroiter got airborne around 8:00 am local time. It cruised over the path of the Jing Pu Railway, which directed the flight to Beiping. The weather was fine during the first part of the flight. The plane landed at Xu Zhou Airport for refueling near 10:00 am, and took off again 10 minutes later. This time first officer Liang was at the controls, as Captain Wang handed the flight over and moved to the passenger's seat. It then flew into Jinan airspace. The aircraft encountered severe fog and began flying off course. The pilot lost the railway in his sight, so he kept on heading for the nearest Wujiapu Airport, which would help him go back on course again. However, the plane started to descend. After the plane passed the waypoint Kaishan County, the pilot headed to the northwest for the target airport. Seconds later, the aircraft hit the peak of what is now called West Mountain below the summit, about six kilometers from Dangjiazhuang Railway Station, and broke off its right wing. This put the plane into a rapidly descending spiral, despite the fuselage remaining relatively intact in mid- air. The Detroiter crashed into the valley below and disintegrated, resulting in a series of fire and explosions, killing two of the three on board instantly.  Crash site  The exact location of where the Stinson Detroiter crashed was controversial. The Government of the Republic of China claimed that the aircraft crashed into Mount Beida, where they set a tomb to commemorate Xu. Popular descriptions of the crash site include West Mountain, East Mountain, North Mountain (later research showed that the three names were for the same mountain), Mount Kai, and Mount Baima. In 2013, investigators deduced the final location of the wreckage according to the documents in the archive. With the help of a modern electronic rangefinder, they followed Jing Pu Railway from Dangjiazhuang Station six kilometers north to a village called Chaomidian, which is north of the crash site. Ranging 1 kilometer from the village, the investigator found the valley, which was identical to eyewitnesses' description. The investigation established that the crash site of the Stinson Detroiter was at West Mountain, which is in the east of Kaishan County in southwest Jinan and one kilometer from the railway, at an elevation of 150 meters.  Search and rescue  A patrol police witnessed the crash of the Detroiter. He immediately rushed to the scene along with some local residents. Meanwhile, Xu's friend, Liang Sicheng, was told to pick Xu up at Nanyuan Airport at around 3:00 pm. He never saw Xu arrive. Liang foreboded that Xu might have crashed and called local police at around 4:30 pm. When the rescuers found the wreckage, they discovered the bodies of the passenger and captain, with debris engulfed in flames. Xu, though not seriously burnt, had suffered from fatal cerebral trauma as well as fractured legs and several cuts on his body. Another friend of Xu, Yu Gengyu (Chinese: ‰∫éËµìËôû), described his corpse afterward as: Next to Xu, carbonic remains of captain Wang's body was also found, scarcely recognizable. Rescuers also discovered first officer Liang, who lay a meter from the two corpses. He had received burns all over his body, yet remained conscious. Liang was rushed to the hospital, but he died en route. The other two on board were considered to have died at the scene of the crash, probably killed instantly. The three bodies were later carried back to Jinan, and Xu's was eventually buried at Mount Beida, which local government had mistaken as the crash site.  Investigation  The first thing investigators identified was a piece of the aircraft's right wing few meters from the mountain peak. That was the first part that came off. This chilled them, as in the same year, a Fokker F-10 had crashed in Kansas in the United States due to a structural failure of the aircraft's wing. Investigators suspected that this crash might be a similar case. But after scrutinizing the debris carefully, the theory was ruled out. Because at that time there were no black boxes, the investigators could only search for clues either at the crash scene or by recreating the crash according to the eyewitnesses' accounts. Witnesses reported that the plane was flying dangerously lower than usual and was circling in the air seconds from the crash, which indicated to investigators that the pilots might have had difficulty finding their route. Investigators also noted that there were two pilots commanding the Detroiter, whose cockpit is designed only for one pilot. They inferred that the first officer was in control at the time of the accident due to the positions of the bodies at the crash scene. Based on the evidence, they hypothesized that the pilot descended the aircraft beneath the minimum safety altitude while attempting to seek their target, Wujiapu airport. Visibility was bad when the plane flew into the fog, and the crews could only use compass heading to navigate. After the plane flew via Dangjiazhuang Railway Station, the first officer gradually lost sight of the railway due to poor visibility. The first officer could look for the airport lights only visually, and failed to recognize the terrain. Runway lights were blocked by the mountains surrounding Jinan. But instead, the pilot in control considered that it was simply caused by thick fog and misjudged the situation. Thus, he continued descending until the plane flew too close to the mountain. There were no ground proximity warning systems on aircraft at that time, so when the terrain abruptly appeared in front of the windshields, it was too late for the pilot to divert the plane. The investigators also concluded that lack of conversation between both pilots also played a major factor of the crash. They believe that the accident could have been avoided if the captain, sitting in the passenger's seat, had reminded the pilot at control that the flight was dangerously close to the terrain. Another theory suggested that both the pilots were disoriented and failed to notice the plane was descending slowly. Therefore, the pilot could not know his exact altitude, which led to the crash. The investigation of the Jinan air crash also revealed deficiencies in early aviation regulations. The crew should have canceled the plan due to the possibility of severe meteorologic conditions.  Conspiracy theories  Some believed that the air crash was a murder arranged by Xu Zhimo's romantic rivals, and that the most likely suspect was Wang Geng (Chinese: ÁéãËµì), who was the former husband of Lu Xiaoman (Xu's wife). A popular version of the crash pointed out that just at the night before the crash, the Northeast Army of Republic of China, in which Wang Geng had served, received a secret telegram which instructed the special agents to destroy a mail plane leaving from Nanking for Beiping. The mission was accomplished. It was a coincidence that the Detroiter planned to share the same route with the plane of their target, meaning that the plane was either shot down or blew up by spies. Investigators authenticated the theory through documents of Northeast Army, but confirmed it was untrue. There were no any records of this special \\"instruction\\".  Legacy  The literary community in China went into mourning when they heard of the Xu's death. Overwhelmed by sadness, Lin Huiyin collected a piece of wreckage from the crash scene. She preserved it at her bedside in memory of Xu throughout the rest of her life.http://js.ifeng.com/humanity/detail_2014_03/24/2027082_0.shtml Xu's memorial park was built in 1932, a year after the crash.

It emphasizes more on the aesthetic value, instead of focusing on socio-cultural themes often used in literary themes, theatre, and other related arts. Using locally sourced media also promotes the culture and tradition of an artist's stomping ground, especially when artists come from more remote areas. Etymology Indigenouism, in general, refers to the work of art by a local artist who uses raw materials available immediately in the area. It is a movement by artists and their works of art using Indigenous Materials for their Masterpieces. It includes activities and creations by those who have felt an inclination toward social and cultural isolation and traditional forms of art. The term Indigenouism comes from the word Indigenous, which refers to things that are naturally occurring in a specific place or area; and indigenous or native people, those who live in a specific place or area (often those who live in remote areas). The term Indigenouism was coined by Elito Circa who led the Indigenouism movement, by showcasing his paintings and introducing his methods to other artisits in 1993. Through this, many of the local artists in his town, even throughout the province, adopted prominent and primary agricultural products as media for their paintings. The movement also advocated for artists in other towns to use the readily available products in their areas, thereby promoting each town‚Äôs unique identity. Another term, Indigenism on the other hand, which refers to ideologies associated with indigenous peoples, is used differently by various scholars and activists, and can be used purely descriptively or carry political connotations. George Kubler's (1985) used the term indigenismo to describe an ideological and stylistic perspective in twentieth-century Latin American art; he underscored the modern nature of this concept as a particularly historical mindset and, less strictly, as anartistic style. It signifies a contemporary attitude in modern Latin American art that concerns itself with the ‚Äúretention of pre- conquest styles‚Äù, as in the murals of Mexican painter Diego Rivera. More importantly, it draws impetus from a twentieth-century expansion of exact knowledge about antiquity in the Americas and seeks to restore Preconquest civilis-ations to ‚Äúsymbolic authority‚Äù (Bakewell, 1995, p. 24; Kubler, 1985, pp. 75‚Äì76; Ramos,1998, pp. 5‚Äì7). It reflects a desire in modern or modernised societies to be deeply movedby an ‚Äúunremembered past‚Äù (Cameron and Gatewood, 2003, pp. 55‚Äì56). Artist advocates Some areas are less endowed than others, hence making the local people more recreative and resourceful, experimenting and producing their own materials to be used for their talents and hobbies and other art-related creations more particularly paintings. In the late 20th century, many local artists in the Philippines has started making their own ways as painters who also adopts Indigenouism. Amongst them were Mark Lawrence Libunao (Garlic), Ramon Lopez (Rust), Jordan Mang-osan (Solar), Wiljun Magsino (Staple), Maria Hidayah Viray-Newingham (Rice), Arlee Macapagal (Onion), Danilo Talplacido (Rice Hull), Jerome Icao (Algae), Dante Enage (Tuba), Rey Lorenzo (Coconut juice-Tuba), Rhod Gamatan (Betel Nut), Patric Palasi (Coffee), Ella Hipolito (Coffee), Percy Denolo (Mud), Diana Grace F. Manalastas (Recycled), Jojet Lamberto Mondares (Plastic Bag), Whang Od and other Indigenouism Artists. Movement In 1998, a group of artists and mountaineers led by Amangpintor wanted to protect the environment against global warming by supporting the advocacy of using indigenous raw materials for painting and at the same time address the issue of lack of materials for painting due to poverty. Creating brushes out of strands of hair, extract from fruits, vegetables and trees are very significant discoveries and experiences of Amangpintor that according to him, this should be taught and shared to the children of new generation especially in the rural areas.

Deposits of the National Bank Reserve Bank were about $4,352,561 on January 13, 1914 and the bank had \\"a large number of country bank accounts, chiefly in the West and Southwest,\\" handling a large degree of cotton exchange business. On January 27, 1914, the National Reserve Bank was taken over by the Mutual Alliance Trust Company, operating for a time as the Reserve Branch of the trust company. History 1909: Formation On February 2, 1909, Consolidated National Bank ratified a plan to acquire the Oriental Bank \\"by allowing its shareholders to subscribe to the shares of a new institution at $150 a share.\\" The Oriental Bank had closed the year prior, but had paid its depositors in full. The new institution, to be named the National Reserve Bank, combined aspects of both banks. A special meeting was called for February 18 for final ratification by stockholders. On February 18, 1909, the bank stockholders voted to enact the merger proposed by the directors, to take over the assets of Oriental Bank and merge them with Consolidated, creating the National Reserve Bank of the City of New York. The plan increased capital of the bank from $1,000,000 to $1,200,000. At the same meeting, 23 directors were elected to the new board, including E. A. Fisher and Mortimer H. Wagar. The bank planned to keep the Consolidated name operative until March 1, 1909. On March 2, 1909, Will-tarn O. Allison (W.O. Allison), president of Consolidated National Bank, was voted president of the new National Reserve Bank entity formed by Consolidated's absorption of Oriental Bank's assets. Thomas J. Lewis and R. W. Jones Jr. were elected vice presidents, and George W. Adams, cashier. With the merger of the reorganized Oriental Bank with the Consolidated National Bank of New York, capital was increased from $1,000,000 to $2,000,000. The National Reserve Bank of the City of New York formally opened its doors for business on March 8, 1909, at \\"the old banking quarters of the Oriental Bank\\" at 182 Broadway, corner of John Street in Manhattan, until new facilities at the City Investing Building could be completed at 165 Broadway. In late April 1909, the National Reserve Bank, formerly named Consolidated National Bank, opened for business in the City Investing Building. 1914: Acquisition Deposits of the National Bank Reserve were about $4,352,561 on January 13, 1914. On January 27, 1914, the National Reserve Bank was taken over by the Mutual Alliance Trust Company, which was based at 35 Wall Street. The two companies had previously been affiliated and had shared directors. At the time of the merge, the New York Times wrote that \\"both institutions have a large number of country bank accounts, chiefly in the West and Southwest, and handle much cotton exchange business.\\" When the National Reserve was liquidated, its stockholders received the value \\"of the assets exceeding the amount of the deposits and a substantial payment for the good will of the institution.\\" Deposits of the merged institutions came to about $12,000,000. For a time, the office of the National Bank Reserve at 165 was continued as the Reserve Branch of the trust company. Directors On February 18, 1909, directors were elected to the board of the newly formed National Reserve Bank of the City of New York, resulting in a board totaling Wagar, Nelson G. Ayres, Charles K.

Built about 1780, it is a well-preserved example of an 18th-century saltbox, with a remarkably well-preserved interior. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Description and history The Beardsley House stands in rural southeastern Kent, on the west side of Beardsley Road south of Kent Hollow Road. It is set back from the road, among fields, with an associated barn across the road to the east. The house is 2-1/2 stories in height, with a side gable roof, large central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. The roof extends down to the first floor in the rear, giving the house a classic New England saltbox profile. The rear lean-to section is an integral part of the house's original construction, and not a later addition. However, the lean-to's rear wall is plank-framed, unlike the rest of the house, which is framed in timber. The main facade is five bays wide, with a central entrance, with a simply framed surround and a six-light transom window. The interior follows a central chimney plan, and retains many original features, including oak floorboards, paneling in the main parlor, and an unusual folding table in the original kitchen space. Doors retain original hardware latches. . The land on which the house stands is part of a parcel purchased by Josiah Beardsley in the 1770s and given to his son Philo in 1781, with the house then standing. The Beardsleys were farmers; Philo was also a captain in the local militia, and had sons who served in the state legislature. The main block of the house has generally avoided modernization on the part of its owners; its modern facilities are located in an ell.

Gastrophysical topics of interest include investigations of the raw materials of food, the effects of food preparation, and quantitative aspects of the physical basis for food quality, flavour, appreciation and absorption in the human body.  Definition and aim  Gastrophysics is a scientific discipline that focuses on investigations of aspects of gastronomy and cooking that relates to phenomena, which can be described and explained in a frame of physics, physical chemistry, chemistry, and associated sciences. The inspiration for gastrophysics is gastronomy and cooking. Gastrophysical studies has a gastronomic observation as its starting point, and aims at unravelling the scientific nature of the observations on many different length scales, including explaining physical and chemical aspects of the raw materials, of their transformations during the preparation of food, as well as of the sensory response while eating. The chemical and physical composition, as well as properties of raw food materials, are important for the transformations that occur in the food during preparation (heating, cooling, mixing, beating, fermenting, salting, drying, smoking, souring etc.). Flavour (taste and smell), mouthfeel, chemesthesis, astringency are all determinants for the sensory evaluation of food, and these characteristics are also related to the chemical properties and the physical texture of the food, and to how the food is transformed in the mouth. Gastrophysics deals with each of these components and aims at uncovering their mutual relations, i.e. how the sensory input relates to the material composition and properties of food, and the absorption in the human body. Gastrophysics is a scientifically inspired approach to gastronomy, but it is a science in its own right, and not a discipline to service chefs in creating new dishes. Gastrophysics focuses on gaining fundamental scientific insight to gastronomy and understanding universal phenomena, without removing any of the craft, creativity, and art characteristics of cooking. The relation between gastrophysics and gastronomy can be seen as analogous to the relation between astrophysics and astronomy. Astronomers observe planets and stars, and describe where they are and how they move. Astrophysicists explain why the planets and stars are where they are, and how they got there. In the same way, gastrophysics aims to explain the universal scientific nature of gastronomy.  Methodology  Whereas gastrophysics is a relatively new discipline within the physical sciences, the foundation for exploring the kind of soft matter that food is, is already well established in other areas of modern physics. The methodology of gastrophysics greatly overlaps with e.g. (molecular) biophysics, soft matter physics, material physics, physical chemistry, analytical chemistry etc. This holds for experimental, theoretical and phenomenological approaches. Gastrophysics leans on state-of-art technologies both experimentally and computationally.  History  It is unknown when the term gastrophysics was first coined, but it appears to have been independently proposed as a physics approach to gastronomy in the labs of the physicist Nicholas Kurti, Peter Barham, and Ole G. Mouritsen. In order to conceptualise the term \\"gastrophysics\\", the first international symposium on the topic‚Äî\\"The emerging science of gastrophysics\\"‚Äîwas held in Copenhagen in 2012, bringing together key actors. One conclusion of the symposium was that gastrophysics could significantly impact gastronomy and tomorrow‚Äôs food sciences, and how both develop in the 21st century.

It is most well known for its involvement in Plessy v. Ferguson. The Citizens Committee was opposed to racial segregation and was responsible for multiple demonstrations in which African Americans rode on the \\"white\\" cars of trains. In 1892, the Citizens' Committee asked Homer Plessy to violate Louisiana's Separate Car law that required the segregation of passenger trains by race. He sat in the \\"whites- only\\" passenger car. When the conductor came to collect his ticket, Plessy told him that he was 7/8 white and that he refused to sit in the \\"blacks-only\\" car. Plessy was immediately arrested by Detective Chris C.

In 1892, the Citizens' Committee asked Homer Plessy to violate Louisiana's Separate Car law that required the segregation of passenger trains by race. He sat in the \\"whites- only\\" passenger car.

Cain, put into the Orleans Parish jail, and released the next day on a $500 bond. Additionally, the committee hired a private detective with arrest powers to detain Plessy, to ensure that he would be charged for violating the Separate Car Act, as opposed to a vagrancy or some other offense. The judge presiding over his case, John Howard Ferguson, ruled that Louisiana had the right to regulate railroad companies while they operated within state boundaries. Plessy was convicted and sentenced to pay a $25 fine. The Citizens' Committee took Plessy's appeal to the Supreme Court of Louisiana, where he again found an unreceptive ear, as the state Supreme Court upheld Judge Ferguson's ruling. The Committee appealed to the United States Supreme Court in 1896. In the seven-to-one decision handed down on May 18, 1896 (Justice David Josiah Brewer did not participate because of the recent death of his daughter), the Court rejected Plessy's arguments based on the Fourteenth Amendment, seeing no way in which the Louisiana statute violated it.

More formally, the EEA has identified three land consuming activities: #The expansion of built-up area which can be directly measured; #the absolute extent of land that is subject to exploitation by agriculture, forestry or other economic activities; and #the over-intensive exploitation of land that is used for agriculture and forestry. In all of those respects, land consumption is equivalent to typical land use in industrialized regions and civilizations. Building construction in Olsztyn, Poland Road construction in Olsztyn, Poland Since often aforementioned conversion activities are virtually irreversible, the term land loss is also used. From 1990 to 2000, of open space were consumed in the U.S.. In Germany, land is being consumed at a rate of more than every day (~ per 10 years). In European Union, land take is estimated approximately about to 1.2 million hectares in 21 EU countries over the period 1990-2006. Land loss can also happen due to natural factors, like erosion or desertification - nevertheless most of those can also eventually be tracked back to human activities. Another slightly different interpretation of the term is the forced displacement or compulsory acquisition of a native people or settlers from their original land due to land grabbing, etc.. Again, in most cases, this will be due to economic reasons like search for profitable investment and commodification of natural resources. Even though global land loss progresses at an alarming rate, the land footprint, the area required by some Western countries can a lot larger than the land actually used or even available in the country itself. While land prices have surged in the first few years of the 21st century, land consumption economy still lacks environmental full-cost accounting to add the long-term costs of environmental degradation. Consequences of land consumption The major effects of land conversion for economic growth are: *Land degradation *Habitat loss - built-up areas support only particularly adapted species *Soil degradation - loss or contamination of top soil by civilization waste and general pollution *Soil compaction - buildings, heavy machinery and vehicle traffic compact the soil to a degree that macrobiotic soil life is eradicated *Impervious surfaces - asphalt and concrete seal of the soil from the atmosphere and disrupt natural water and biogeochemical cycles See also *Land restoration *Land rehabilitation *Land reclamation * Land use Land conversion in W√∂rrstadt, Germany References Land use Ecology Environmental issues with soil Human impact on the environment ","title":"Land consumption"},{"id":"52921807","text":"Strange Cacti is the debut EP by American singer-songwriter and musician Angel Olsen.

It is much broader term than coastal erosion because land loss also includes land converted to open water around the edges of estuaries and interior bays and lakes and by subsidence of coastal plain wetlands. The most important causes of land loss in coastal plains are erosion, inadequate sediment supply to beaches and wetlands, subsidence, and global sea level rise.

Commonly, wetland loss is defined as the conversion of vegetated wetlands into either uplands or drained areas; unvegetated wetlands (e.g., mudflats); or (submerged habitats (open water). According to this, and similar definitions, wetland loss includes both land loss and land consumption as components of it. In historic times, both wetland and land loss typically are the result of a varying, often controversial mixture of natural and anthropogenic factors.Boesch, D.F., Josselyn, M.N., Mehta, A.J., Morris, J.T., Nuttle, W.K., Simenstad, C.A. and Swift, D.J., 1994.

The role of hydrocarbon production on land subsidence and fault reactivation in the Louisiana coastal zone. Journal of Coastal Research, 23(3) pp.771-786. There are other definitions of wetland loss commonly used. For example, some researchers defined wetland loss as \\"the substantial removal of wetland from its ecologic role under natural conditions.\\"Craig, N.J., Turner, R.E. and Day, J.W., 1979. Land loss in coastal Louisiana (USA). Environmental Management, 3(2), pp.133-144.  Land loss and deltas  Because of a highly variable combination of sea level rise, sediment starvation, coastal erosion, wetland deterioration, various types of subsidence, and various human activities, land loss within delta plains is a significant global problem. The large delta plains of the world, including the Danube, Ganges, Brahmaputra, Indus, Mahanadi, Mangoky, McKenzie, Mississippi, Niger, Nile, Shatt el Arab, Volga, Yellow, Yukon, and Zambezi deltas, have all suffered significant land loss as the result of either coastal erosion, internal conversion of wetlands to open water, or a combination of both. For the 15 deltas studied by Coleman and others,Coleman, J.M., Huh, O.K. and Braud Jr, D., 2008. Wetland loss in world deltas. Journal of Coastal Research, 24(sp1), pp. 1-14. these deltas experienced a total irreversible land loss of of wetlands between the early 1980s and 2002. During this period, the total average land loss for all of these deltas was about per year. In case of the Mississippi River Delta, they found that in a 12-year period, some of wetlands had been converted to new open water at a rate of per year.

In 1889, Hunton became the first black woman to graduate from Spencerian College of Commerce. She worked for the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA), served as the national organizer for the National Association of Colored Women (NACW) from 1906 to 1910, and served in the U.S. Army during World War I. Hunton was a regular participant in the work of the Equal Suffrage League.  Early years and education Addie D. Waites was born in Norfolk, Virginia on June 11, 1866 to Jesse and Adeline Waites. Her mother died when she was very young, and Hunton then moved to Boston to be raised by her maternal aunt. In Boston, Hunton attended the Boston Latin School and graduated with a high school diploma. After high school, she attended Spencerian College of Commerce and became the first black woman to graduate in 1889. Career After graduation, Hunton moved to Normal, Alabama, to teach at the State Normal and Agricultural College, which is now known as the Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University. In New York, Hunton was recognized by the National Board of the YWCA in 1907 and appointed as secretary. She was responsible for organizing projects among black students. Additionally, she traveled through the South and Midwest to conduct a survey for the YWCA. Hunton is well known for her social welfare efforts among the black community. Furthermore, she recruited a number of other black women to work for the YWCA, such as Eva del Vakia Bowles and Elizabeth Ross Haynes. From 1909 to 1910, Hunton moved with her children to Europe. Her husband was suffering from health issues and remained at home in the U.S.. While in Europe, Hunton lived in Switzerland and then moved to Strasbourg, Germany, where she studied part-time at Kaiser Wilhelm University. When Hunton and her children moved back to America, she continued to work with the YWCA and also began to take courses at the College of the City of New York. At this time, her husband William was in a critical state with tuberculosis. The Hunton family then moved to Saranac Lake, New York, where they stayed until his death in 1916. In 1917, the U.S. entered World War I. Hunton quickly became involved through YMCA, and in June 1918, she set sail for France. She was one of three black women, the others being Kathryn Johnson and Helen Curtis, who were assigned to work with the 200,000 segregated black troops stationed in France. Hunton soon became exposed to the racism against African American soldiers. She saw efforts by the American Command to regulate the lives of black soldiers, recreating a system reminiscent of Jim Crow. In France, Hunton began working for the Services of Supplies sector at Saint Nazaire. She introduced many new programs to increase the quality of the soldiers' lives, including a literacy course and a discussion series on art, music, and religion, and other topics. Of Hunton's many wartime efforts, a particularly gruesome assignment was given to her in May 1919. She was sent to a military cemetery and was ordered to oversee and comfort black soldiers who were assigned to recover the dead from the battlefield of the Meuse-Argonne and rebury them.  Personal life In July 1893, she married William Alphaeus Hunton, who was working in Norfolk, Virginia to establish YMCA for Negro youth. Hunton worked closely with her husband as his secretary. In 1899, the couple moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where Hunton gave birth to four children, of which only two survived infancy, including Eunice Hunton. After seven years in Atlanta, the couple moved to Brooklyn, New York due to the Atlanta riot of 1906, as they feared for their safety. From 1909 to 1910, Hunton took her children to study at the Kaiser Wilhelm University in Strasbourg, France, after which she enrolled in courses at the College of the City of New York. In 1914, Hunton's husband William died. Hunton and Kathryn Johnson wrote a book documenting their experience of war time tragedies and race-relations within American forces, titled Two Colored Women With the American Expeditionary Forces, published in 1920. She published a book about her husband's life and work entitled William Alphaeus Hunton, A Pioneer Prophet of Young Men in 1938. She died in Brooklyn on June 21, 1943, having dedicated her life to issues of racial and gender equality.  Legacy  Hunton is known for her commitment to peace, race relations, and the empowerment of the African American community, especially women. She created a three-part peace strategy. First, she encouraged African American women to create an international organization for themselves. Second, Hunton believed that African American women should get involved in the Pan- African movement, which was predominantly male-dominated at this point. Finally, she aimed to involved African American women in the mainly white U.S. movement for peace.

She was internationally known for her contributions to psychology, writing, and Cuban politics. Born and raised in Cuba, she sought exile in New York because of Cuban communist rule. Casal received a master's degree in psychology in 1962 and later, a doctorate in 1975 from the New School for Social Research. She wrote the book El caso Padilla: literatura y revolucion en Cuba, which illustrated the failing relationship between writers and Cuban officials. A year later, she co-founded a journal named Nueva Generation which focused on creating dialogue on relationships between Cubans living abroad and on the island. Casal earned notoriety by attempting to reconcile Cuban exiles in the United States. She was instrumental in organizing a dialogue between Cuban immigrants and Fidel Castro, which led to the release of thousands of Cuban prisoners. She was the first Cuban-American to receive the Casa de las Am√©ricas Prize, which was awarded to her posthumously in 1981.  Early life  Lourdes Emilia de la Caridad Casal y Vald√©s was born on 5 April 1938 in Havana to Emilia Vald√©s, a teacher, and Pedro Casal, a dentist and physician. Her family was of mixed- racial descent, including African, Chinese and Spanish ancestry. She was privately educated until 1951, when she entered Institute No. 2 in El Vedado. She graduated in 1954 with a bachelor's degree in science and letters with the simultaneous certification as a land appraiser and surveyor. Furthering her studies, Casal enrolled in St. Thomas of Villanova Catholic University (Villanova), pursuing a degree in chemical engineering. She became editor of several publications while she was studying, including Memoria and Revista Insula, as well as a regular contributor to the newspaper El Quib√∫. She joined the Cultural Association and served as its Secretary General and became president of the women's group of the Catholic Youth Organization, () of Villanova. She won the second prize of the 1956-1957 term literary competition with a paper on the work of Father F√©lix Varela, which led her to change direction the following term and enroll in the school of psychology. As the country radicalized, Casal became involved with the Catholic elements of the 26th of July Movement participating with other students from Villanova. She was active in the anti-Batista Student Revolutionary Directorate () and like other members within the group, switched sides after the Cuban Revolution to oppose what they saw as a betrayal of the revolutionary ideals. She worked briefly in the counterrevolutionary movement in Cuba, but in 1962 was forced into exile. As a Director from the Consejo Revolucionario Cubano, she made a tour of Africa, underwritten by the CIA, collecting information on the continent and published an account of her experiences in Cuba Nueva.  Career   Professorship  Settling in New York in 1962, Casal enrolled in psychology courses at the New School for Social Research and completed her master's degree in 1962. She taught at the City University of New York and simultaneously began a prolific writing career. Her works focused on her need to understand people; she analyzed topics in literature, politics, and the social sciences. Casal later moved to Rutgers University and then in 1969 co- founded the Institute for Cuban Studies at Rutgers She also taught at Dominican College of Blauvelt. An interesting aspect of Casal's writing is that her scholarly works primarily were written in English, while her literary works were written in Spanish.  Writings  Casal wrote many poems and articles about Cuba and exploring what it meant to be an exile. In her poetry, she explored how being an exile had changed her life, making her no longer only Cuban, but with a recognition that she would never fully be a New Yorker. Racial and social inequality, the suppressive politics of both her homeland and adopted home, and struggle to understand changed Casal from an opponent to a supporter of the Cuban government in the early 1970s. In 1971, she began compiling documents to explore the arrest of the poet Heberto Padilla, and her article El Caso Padilla became a pivotal point in changing her stance on Castro. She co-founded two journals Nueva Generaci√≥n (1972), which aimed to critically explore both positive and negative effects of the Cuban regime and Are√≠to (1974), which was openly supportive of the Cuban state.  Travel to Cuba and Castro advocacy In 1973, she became the first US exile from Cuba to return to the country. Being invited by the government to return was at the time a novel event, as the government stance had branded those who left as betrayers of the revolution. She stayed from May to September and from that point forward was an outspoken advocate of the Cuban government. At times her advocacy was seen to divide the Cuban exile community, but her ability to maintain her position and allow voices of opposition to speak as well, gained overall respect of the diaspora. Casal was awarded the Cintas Fellowship in 1974 and completed her PhD from the New School for Social Research in 1975. In the mid-seventies, she explored racism and its cultural context, such as the difference of being mulatto in Cuba verses black in the United States. In 1973, she wrote Los Fundadores: Alfonso y Otros Cuentos (The Founders: Alfonso and Other Stories) which discussed the history of Chinese-Cubans. She co-wrote with Rafael Prohias The Cuban Minority in the United States in 1974, comparing the different experiences of white and black Cuban migrants in terms of their \\"success\\". In 1977, Casal began work on the Antonio Maceo Brigade, a project aimed at reuniting young Cuban-Americans with the island. When President Jimmy Carter agreed to allow a selected group of Cubans to return in 1978, Casal assisted in drafting the list of participants. The meeting, which became known as \\"The Dialogue\\" () brought members of the Cuban diaspora to Havana to discuss points of interest with Cuban officials. In addition to allowing separated families to reunite, \\"The Dialogue\\" resulted in the release of \\"thirty-six hundred political prisoners\\". Beginning in 1977, Casal, who was diabetic, began to experience renal dysfunction and had to begin dialysis treatment. Though she continued trips to and from Cuba in her attempts to serve as a bridge between Cubans and Cuban-Americans, her health was in decline. In 1980, she participated in a conference as part of the activities of the Institute for Cuban Studies, which was held in Cuba, during the Mariel boatlift. Soon after the conference, she decided to return permanently to Cuba.  Legacy  Casal died on 1 February 1981, aged 41 in Havana from complications of her illnesses. Her final work, Polabras juntan revoluci√≥n (Words Join Revolution) received the Casa de las Am√©ricas Prize, posthumously shortly after her death. The impact she had on Cubans internationally left an important legacy for having begun the conversation between Cuban politicians and refugees through both her writing and advocacy. Her stance on reconciliation between the diaspora and Cuban politicians and support of the regime, impacted her status as an exile and for a period of time, she was omitted from Cuban-American literature compilations. A reawakening of her legacy coincided with talks of normalization of the US/Cuban relationship at the turn of the 21st century.

He tried to turn the publication into a more general labour movement newspaper, printing articles about developments in other trades, national and international news, and even works of literature. Owen followed his father in promoting trade unionism, and supported A. J. Mundella's efforts to set up industrial arbitration boards. In 1868, a Potteries Board was established, and Owen was appointed as its first secretary. He attended early Trades Union Congress (TUC) meetings to promote the idea of formalised arbitration and conciliation, and was elected to the Parliamentary Committee of the TUC in 1873, though he was only in post for a year. He devoted much of the early 1870s attempting to form an international union for pottery workers, although this attracted little interest outside the local area. In 1873, Owen launched a new paper, the Labour Press, Miners' and Workmen's Examiner, with the intention that this would provide much of the material for a series of local labour newspapers around the country. This was initially successful, leading him to resign from the Potteries Examiner in 1874, and move to Wolverhampton, continuing to publisher the Examiner and also launch the new Wolverhampton Times. However, circulation gradually fell; in 1877, all the publications were consolidated into the Midland Examiner and Wolverhampton Times, promoting more orthodox liberal politics, and this closed two years later. Owen returned to Staffordshire, settling in Hanley, where he again took over the Potteries Examiner, but this closed in 1880, and he thereafter launched a string of largely unsuccessful papers, the Staffordshire Knot being the most enduring. Owen became active in the local Liberal Party, and was elected to Hanley Town Council. At the 1886 United Kingdom general election, he stood in Sheffield Ecclesall, where he was defeated, taking 2,688 votes to the winner's 3,930. He renewed his links with local unions, and was the leading figure in a major strike of potters in 1881; this destroyed the United Branches, but Owen founded a new National Order of Potters in 1882 as its replacement. He was linked with the union for many years, and was again a leading figure during a lock-out in 1892. Owen retired in 1897, although he continued to write newspaper articles, principally on the topic of arbitration.

It is the fourth-highest distinct mountain of Thuringia, after Gro√üer Beerberg (), Schneekopf () and Gro√üer Finsterberg () and forms a landmark that can be viewed in particular from northern and western directions.  Geography  The summit of Gro√üer Inselsberg is located about NNE of Brotterode and southwest of Bad Tabarz. It forms a narrow, arched plateau of about length. The steep slopes are marked by deep dents and spurs formed by weathering. The summit has a dominance radius of extending to Sommerbachskopf ( a.s.l.) and a prominence of relative to the saddle at Heuberghaus. With the exception of the buildings, the summit region of Gro√üer Inselsberg has been a nature reserve since 30 March 1961.  Geology  Gro√üer Inselsberg is a rhyolitic butte that has withstood the weathering of the surrounding softer rock layers. The near-surface rocks of the summit region belong to the lower vulcanites of the Oberhof sequence in the lower Rotliegend and crop out in Reitsteine, a steep escarpment southeast of the summit. They are embedded in the conglomerates, sandstones and siltstones of the Goldlauter sequence to the north and the grainy gneiss of Cambrian origin to the south. An abrupt transition between the Inselsberg rhyolite and the gneiss can be observed along the west‚Äìeast Inselsberg fault.  Flora  The potential natural vegetation of the mountain is a beech forest, on the northern slope with an undergrowth of heath bedstraw, on the sunny southern side with woodrush. Some near-natural beech forests are preserved on the southern and the northeastern slope. The common spruce has been introduced through silviculture. The once indigenous silver fir has disappeared. Other naturally occurring tree species include sycamore, Norway maple, ash, elm, sessile oak, pedunculate oak, silver birch, alder, larch, goat willow, and wild cherry.  Name  The name is popularly ascribed to the solitary aspect of Gro√üer Inselsberg and is said to be derived from German einzeln (\\"solitary\\") or Insel (Island), but is probably derived from a stream called Emse or in the Middle Ages Enze which has its source on the northwestern slope of the mountain.  Tourism  The mountain is one of the best known excursion destinations in Thuringia. Its summit is crossed by the traditional mountain path Rennsteig, whose route is shared here by the European long-distance hiking path E3 and the international mountain hiking path Eisenach‚ÄìBudapest (EB). A road facilitating access to the summit branches off the state road 1024 between Brotterode and Tabarz, and parking spaces are provided. A youth hostel, a restaurant and an outlook tower serve tourists.

History The earliest church of St Luke was constructed in 1916 of cinder blocks at the junction of Lythalls Lane and Holbrook Lane. It was started as a mission church from St Paul's, Foleshill, in which parish Holbrooks was originally situated. Next door a wooden hut served for many years as a venue for local community activities. With the opening of many more factories and works locally, the area soon expanded very quickly and plans were made for a purpose-built church. The parish of Holbrooks was created in 1935 with Fr Charles Dodd as its first parish priest. From its beginnings, St Luke's has fostered a Catholic tradition and a regular round of sacramental worship was maintained. The new church was built in Rotherham Road and completed in 1939 to the designs of Nugent Cachemaille-Day. The exterior was of red brick and notable features were an external altar and pulpit and concrete windows. Sadly, only a few months after its consecration, the church was rendered unusable by bombing in the 1940 Coventry Blitz. After several years the church was repaired and restored to its original appearance. A Parish Centre was added in the 1960s during the nearly 40-year incumbency of the much loved Fr Henry Hughes. Alterations of the interior over the years have opened up the chancel, improved lines of sight and brought more light into the building. A major refurbishment in 2007 saw the installation of a new state-of-the-art heating system and new upholstered seating. Present day Today Saint Luke's remains as a sign of the Church's presence in Holbrooks and still offers its parishioners a place where they can meet with their fellow-worshippers, bring their deepest needs and concerns and also mark personal and family events, whether happy or sad. St Luke's stands in the traditionalist Catholic tradition of the Church of England and receives alternative episcopal oversight from the Bishop of Ebbsfleet.

In an integrated CLEM system, the sample is imaged using an electron beam and an optical light path simultaneously. Traditionally, samples would be imaged using two separate microscopy modalities, potentially at different facilities and using different sample preparation methods. Integrated CLEM is thus considered to be beneficial because the methodology is quicker and easier, and it reduces the chance of changes in the sample during the process of data collection. Overlay of the two images is thus performed automatically as a result of the integration of two microscopes. This technique is used in order to obtain information at different length scales: the electron microscope provides high-resolution information down to the nano-scale, while the fluorescence microscope highlights the regions of interest. CLEM is used for various disciplines in the life sciences, including neuroscience, tissue research, and protein research. Correlative microscopy is much more than simply a combination of microscopes, but also of software, techniques and data.  Fluorescence microscope  In preparation for imaging with a fluorescence microscope, different methods can be used, such as fluorophores or dyes, immunolabeling, and genetically encoded fluorescent proteins. Different fluorescent labels can be used in order to highlight multiple regions of interest in the sample. Recently Kumar et al combined FRET based molecular tension measurements with cryo-electron microscopy to study how force on talin (a focal adhesion protein which directly links integrins to actin) is related to actin organization. Regions of high talin tension have highly aligned and linear filamentous actin while regions of low tension have less well-aligned actin structure.  Electron microscope  The electron microscope is used to obtain structural information at the nano-scale. Unlike an optical microscope, an electron microscope is able to surpass the diffraction limit of light. This is because the wavelength of accelerated electrons is much shorter than the wavelength of visible light.

Born in Knaresborough, then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, Morley moved with his family to Copley when he was ten. There, he began working half-time at Edward Akroyd's worsted mill, while continuing his education. However, he later completed an apprenticeship as an iron moulder in Halifax. He became prominent in the Friendly Society of Iron Founders (FSIF), and was also active in his local Liberal Party.David E. Martin, \\"Morley, Robert\\", Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.IX, pp.225‚Äì227 Early in the 1890s, Morley became convinced of socialism. He was elected as the secretary of the Halifax Labour Union, then as the first secretary of the local branch of the Independent Labour Party. In this role, he worked closely with Mont Blatchford, but often came into conflict with John Lister, the party's national treasurer, who lived locally. He was also a regular speaker at the local Labour Church, and served on Halifax Trades Council. In the late 1890s, Morley worked closely with Tom Mann to recruit local gasworkers to the Workers' Union. Through this activity, they secured recognition by the council, and Morley won election to the council in 1899, taking a place on its gasworks committee to further the gasworkers' cause. By 1900, it had become the Workers' Union's largest single branch, and Morley was elected as national president of the union, also working for it as a full-time organiser. Morley supported the new Labour Representation Committee (LRC); he was organising secretary of the Wakefield LRC in 1903, and applied for FSIF sponsorship to contest the 1903 Barnard Castle by-election, though the membership instead voted to back Arthur Henderson, who won the seat. Morley lost his council seat in 1905, but won it back the year after, and was made an alderman in 1908. He also served as president of the trades council in 1910. In 1913, Morley lost re-election as president of the Workers' Union, and was instead made its organiser for the unusual district of Yorkshire, north Lancashire and Herefordshire; this was later reduced to cover only Yorkshire. He was asked to stand for Labour in Colchester in the general election expected in 1914 or 1915, but World War I intervened, and when a general election was finally held, in 1918, he had secured his own union's sponsorship to stand in Doncaster. He was then made Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for Skipton; in 1920, he stood down, also resigning from the council, due to poor health. Despite this, he stood in Sheffield Park at the 1922 United Kingdom general election, narrowly failing to win the seat. Morley' remained active in the Workers' Union, and its successor, the Transport and General Workers' Union, although, due to his worsening health, he principally represented the union on various boards and committees. Shortly before his death, he became a follower of the Neo-Zoroastrian Mazdaznan movement, although his funeral took place in a congregational church.

It dates from the early nineteenth century, and was bred specifically for cock-fighting. It named for its area of origin, that of the city of Bruges (Brugge), in West Flanders in the north- east of Belgium. It is one of three Belgian breeds of fighting-cock, the others being the Luikse Vechter and the Tiense Vechter. It is a hardy breed, but the birds are often aggressive; those reared for exhibition may show less aggression. History The Brugse Vechter is the oldest of the three Belgian fighting-cock breeds. It originated in western Flanders in the early years of the nineteenth century, and was formerly common throughout Belgium. It was first mentioned as ' (\\"the Bruges breed\\") in 1858. The first breed standard was drawn up in 1908. The other fighting breeds, the Luikse Vechter from the area of Li√®ge in Wallonia, and the Tiense Vechter from the area of Tienen in Flemish Brabant, both derive from it. The Brugse Vechter is endangered in Belgium. In 2010 there were approximately 200 birds, almost all of which were in Flanders. A bantam Brugse Vechter was bred in the second part of the twentieth century. The plumage colours are superior to those of the full-sized breed. It is critically endangered in Belgium. Some are reared in Germany and in the Netherlands. Characteristics The Brugse Vechter is a large, powerful and aggressive bird. For this reason, cocks and hens may need to be kept separately. Strains reared exclusively for exhibition may show less aggression. The back is flat, is as broad as it is long, and is almost horizontal; the other Belgian gamecock breeds have a sloping back. The face is deeply pigmented, and may vary from purplish-red to almost black. The comb is small and triple; the legs are thick and strong, and are slate-blue. Seventeen plumage colours are recognised. Use The Brugse Vechter was bred for its fighting ability. Cock-fighting is against the law in Belgium, and practitioners of the sport usually travel to northern France. Some strains are reared only for exhibition at poultry shows. The Brugse Vechter is a better layer than many fighting breeds. Hens lay about 150 cream-coloured eggs per year, with a weight of They are not good sitters. The meat is fine-textured and of good flavour. References Further reading * J.-M. Larivi√®re, J. Detilleux, P. Leroy (2011).

In 1939, White was named as the president of the Houston chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) before becoming executive secretary of the branch in 1943. Under her leadership, the Houston chapter of the NAACP more than doubled in size from 1943 to 1948. Early life White was born in Elmo, Texas in 1900 to Samuel Henry Madison and Easter Madison. She was the tenth of their twelve children. Elmo was a predominately black community thirty-five miles north of Dallas. The region was noted for its especially racist customs, and this helped incite White's to become a civil rights activist. Her father helped encourage White to receive and education. Career In 1923, White enrolled at Butler College in Tyler, Texas for a year before transferring to Prairie View College (now Prairie View A&M; University) in Hempstead, Texas. Here, she received a bachelor's degree in English in 1928. Following graduation, White married Julius White, a Houston businessman and NAACP member who had been involved in voting rights cases. Because White was unable to find a job in Houston due to her husband's connection with the Civil Rights Movement, White took a teaching position in Lufkin, Texas, where she taught English and physical education. After nine years of teaching, White resigned to become a full-time activist with the NAACP. White soon became the first woman to become a full-time salaried executive secretary of a local chapter of the NAACP. In 1949, White stepped down from executive secretary of the Houston branch after disagreements with Carter Wesley over the issue of racial integration. However, she remained the Director of State Branches. White led the movement for the Houston City Council to pass an ordinance that would allow city hospitals to employ black doctors, helped organize protests for African-American women to be able to try on clothes in department stores, and worked to integrate taxi companies. She went on to be a fieldworker for the national branch of the NAACP, and later the national branch of the NAACP went on to create a Lulu White Freedom Fund in her honor. She remained politically active until her death, which was caused by a heart ailment on July 6, 1957. Voting Rights and Economic Equality White took many initiatives to help African Americans gain the right to vote. She played a role in the elimination of the White primaries in 1943, which stated that only whites were able to vote in Democratic Party party primaries. White thought that it was essential for African Americans to have equal civil liberties and equal economic opportunities. In promoting this idea, she encouraged African Americans to seek employment opportunities at businesses that were traditionally regarded as white establishments. While White herself adopted this notion of equal employment opportunity, she was frequently refused to been seen by management and was turned away. To highlight the inequality of employment opportunities among whites and African Americans, she organized group demonstrations condemning managers of this behavior. As a consequence of this, White was sometimes labeled a communist. Legacy White remained active as an activist in the black community until her death on July 6, 1957. It is suspected that she died of heart disease and is currently buried in Paradise South in Houston, Texas. In the week before her death, the NAACP created the Lulu White Freedom Fund in her honor.

History Nothing is known about the original name, construction date or owner of the castle. Prehistoric pottery shards have been discovered under the castle, as well as medieval artifacts from the 10th to 12th centuries. In 1150 the Freiherr von Rotenburg granted extensive lands around Stans and Ennetmoos to Murbach-Lucerne Monastery. It is possible that he may have built a castle on these lands to administer his lands. In an 1197 record the Rozziberg is listed as owing taxes to Engelberg Abbey, from which castles were normally exempt. This may indicate that the castle was built after this date. However, the generally accepted date of the ring wall is the 12th century. The wooden buildings inside the ring wall were probably replaced with stone between 1210 and 1230. According to the White Book of Sarnen (compiled ca. 1470), Rotzberg was one of the castles destroyed in the Burgenbruch rebellion against the Habsburg reeves in ca. 1308, the event marking the foundation of the Swiss Confederacy. Aegidius Tschudi, writing in ca. 1550, dates the event to New Year's Day 1308. In Tschudi's account of the men had a relationship with a serving maid in the castle and convinced her to let down a rope so he could climb up into her bedroom one night. After he climbed up and distracted her, an additional 20 men used the rope to storm the castle and destroy it. There is no archaeological evidence pointing to a violent destruction of the castle. It is unknown when exactly the castle was abandoned, but this likely happened still in the 13th century, with proposed dates as early as 1239. The hill top with the ruined castle was used as a look out station during the 1798 French invasion and the 1847 Sonderbund War. During the 17th and 18th centuries the hill was used as a hermitage. In 1872 a small pension was built in the center of the old castle courtyard. In 1910, a plan to demolish the ruins and build a hotel pushed the Federal Government to buy the site for CHF 18,000 and declare it a protected heritage site. In 2010 the Swiss Federal Government repaired and cleaned the ruins. In 2015 they announced that they are planning to transfer responsibility over the ruins to the Canton on Nidwalden. Castle site The castle was surrounded by a large five sided ring wall that enclosed about . The wall was up to thick on the west side and thick on the remaining sides. It was built of carefully fitted dressed stone. The western wall was also protected by a wide ditch while the other sides had steep slopes protecting them.

Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right to access public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.Freedom of Information, UNESCO. Access to public information builds on the principle that in a democratic system people should be in the condition of accessing a wide range of information in order to effectively participate in public life as well as on matters affecting them. In Armenia the right of access to information is guaranteed and defined by the Articles 27 and 27.1 of the Constitution. Also, Armenia has a specific law on freedom of information providing the basic foundations for the realization of this right. According to the Constitution and the Law, in Armenia everybody, in spite of the fact he/she is a citizen of the country or not, has a right to have access to information. Legal framework The Law on Freedom of Information was adopted in September 2003 and was widely considered a progressive document, greatly appreciated by international experts. Since the adoption of the law, civil society and the journalists community, have advocated for the need to pass the regulations that would have supported and improved the implementation of the law. Such regulations were finally adopted in October 2015, when the Armenian government approved a procedure for improving the effectiveness of the procedure to access public information by streamlining the classification, maintenance and provision of information from the government to the public. Prior to the adoption of these regulations, in several cases public officials used to cite the lack of these implementation rules when refusing requests for information. Public bodies concerned by access to information According to the law, people can obtain information from: central government bodies, self-governing bodies, state institutions, organizations financed from central or local government finances, organizations with public functions, i.e. organisations providing public services (for instance, private universities, schools, hospitals, energy provider companies, etc.) Each body has a person that is responsible for freedom of information and is in charge of dealing with information requests. Procedure To submit a request to access information, applicants have to apply to the information holder with a written or oral inquiry to be addressed to specific departments in the appropriate body or organization. Civil society organizations advocating for access to information suggest to apply with a written inquiry so that a compliant can be done in case of rejection. To be taken into consideration, both written and oral inquiries have to meet the requirements stated by the law. The inquirer is not obliged to justify the enquiry and to state the reason for it or how the information sought is going to be used. If the body/organizations does not possess all the details concerning the information required, the information holder has to provide the available parts and mention the name and the location of other possible information holders who might be in possess of other details concerning the information sought. Information are provided free of charge. Only technical expenses of information provision (photocopies, electronic supports, etc.) can be charged. Exceptions Freedom of information can be restricted only on grounds well defined by the law. Information holder may refuse to provide information if it contains state, official, bank or trade secret; infringe the privacy of individuals and his family; contains pre-investigation data which cannot be made public; concerns data with accessibility limitation (such as business, notary or medical secrets); infringes copyright and associated rights. Right to appeal In case of rejection, the information holder has to inform the applicant within 5 days in a written form and explain the reasons for the refusal as well as the relevant appealing procedures. Denials can be appealed to the Ombudsman or the court by administrative procedure. Citizens can also apply directly to the concerned bodies without appealing by an administrative procedure. Also, it is possible to apply to non-governmental organizations which provide legal advisory. Access to public information in practice In practice, despite the good legal framework, citizens and media professionals face some problems in accessing documents, such as incomplete disclosure of the information required, extensions of the time frame for obtaining information prescribed by the law, the refusal of some government bodies and officials to implement the law, and so forth. According to the NGO Freedom of Information Center of Armenia and the Transparency International Anticorruption Center, the main challenge is the behaviour of some public officials and public bodies that continue to provide answers that are either irrelevant or incomplete. This has resulted in major difficulties for NGOs being less and less successful in bringing freedom of information cases before the courts than in previous years, as judges rejected their cases on the grounds that public offices had provided the answers, regardless of their content. In Armenia, NGOs have played a significant role in educating the public on how to exercise their \\"right to know\\" and have organised trainings for public officials. By 2012, the NGO Freedom of Information Center Armenia has distributed around 2050 bulletin boards in several urban and rural communities in order to inform the public on the right to access public information and how to realize it.

During this time, Hale's objective was to educate and train 'granny midwives.' (These women managed the medical side of pregnancies and assisted in delivery. They also were the ones who completed birth certificates for new born babies.) Her efforts were in place to address the public health disparity between black and white women that was currently evident.  Early life and education  Mamie Odessa Hale was born on November 19, 1910 in Keeneys Creek, West Virginia, as the third child to Emanuel Hale and Minnie Maude Creasy Hale. Hale attended the Tuskegee School of Nurse- Midwifery for Colored Nurses in Alabama in 1941. The school was one of the few programs created to educate African American nurses. The Rosenwald Foundation and Children‚Äôs Bureau, a government organization used to record and oversee all matters relating to child welfare, funded the school. The school required a bachelor's degree to enroll, but there is no record of where she would have received this education. The school graduated 31 students before its closing in 1946.  Early career  Mamie Odessa Hale began her career in public health in 1942 in Crittenden County health department. At the time many registered nurses were off helping the war effort for World War II, which opened up more opportunities for Hale to further her career. Due to low access to health facilities in rural areas and racial barriers, disparity in the mortality rates of black children became a social issue that had to be handled. Before Hale‚Äôs involvement, the attempts made by the state to regulate and educate midwives had been unsuccessful. Hale‚Äôs strong community support on these efforts encouraged many women, on average between 60 and 80 years old, to strive to obtain nursing permits.  Career highlights  After much success Hale was appointed to the role of midwife consultant for the Arkansas Department of Health. In this position, she educated ‚Äúgranny‚Äù midwives to become more competent in the delivery of children. While working for the Arkansas Department of Health, Hale planned her own 8- to 12-week training program for granny midwives. Many of these women in training were illiterate, so Hale created her program to be demonstration based, consisting of movies, singing, and pictures. After the completion of the full training, the midwives became state certified. Her work with the public health system lead to a decrease in the number deaths of African Americans due to pregnancy and childbirth to only 43 in 1950, in comparison to the 128 in 1930. Due to her great influence, Hale gained popularity not only in the medical community, but also in the civil rights movement. Supporters of Hale, both white and black, boycotted restaurants that refused to serve African Americans and called for equality across the country.

He served as the school's President from its inception until his retirement in 1943.Titus Brown, Albany State University: A Centennial History: 1903-2003 (Charleston, S.C.: Arcadia Publishing, 2003).Holly, J. W. (1955). Education and the segregation issue: A program of education for the economic and social regeneration of the southern negro. New York: William-Frederick Press. Born in Winnsboro, South Carolina in 1874 to two former slaves, Holley attended school at Phillips Andover Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. Wishing to enter the ministry, in preparation, he finished his education at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania. Early life and education Holley was born to George and Mary Lucinda, two former slaves, in Winnsboro, South Carolina. His mother was a domestic servant and his father a skilled leather worker. He was the fifth of eleven children and attended Presbyterian freedmen schools.O'Brien, T. (2007). Perils of Accommodation: The Case of Joseph W. Holley. American Educational Research Journal, 44(4), 806-852. He was sent by training teachers, Reverend Loomis and his wife, to Brainard Institute, and later continued his education at Revere Lay College in Massachusetts. It was around this time that Holley met the Hazard family, who would support him in his education by helping him attend the Phillips Andover Academy in Massachusetts, and eventually finish his education at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania. The Hazard family would be an important life connection for Holley as they would support his endeavors to start a school. Albany Bible and Manual Training Institute  Inspired by his reading of W. E. B. Du Bois's writings on the poor living conditions experienced by southern African Americans in Georgia, Holley decided to move to Albany, Georgia, and established the Albany Bible and Manual Training Institute. Prior to Albany, Holley had the chance to meet Booker T. Washington, who further influenced him to start a school. Within a year, he had moved to Albany and purchased of land near the Flint River for the campus, and established a Board of Trustees. In its early period, the foundation of the school was to prepare blacks for a life that emphasized a Christian living, habits of industry, literacy, agricultural skills, and homemaking. In 1917, the school transitioned from offering an elementary education to a two- year college, and was renamed the Georgia Normal and Agricultural College. From the time the school was founded in 1903 to the time Holley retired in 1943, enrollment grew from an initial 5 students to 190. Following Holley's Retirement in 1943, the school transitioned to a four-year University and was renamed to Albany State University. By 1948 the enrollment had increased from 190 to 722. Impact on education in the U.S. south Holley's mother was a slave who could neither read nor write, and growing up the opportunities for education for negro children were not freely available. The first school Holley attended in 1878 was a mission school taught by a Northern missionary, the only school he had the option to attend. Having experienced this lack of scholastic options, Holley developed the passion to improve the education element of the lives of the Negro youth in the South. At the time Holley started his school, the State of Georgia didn't support a single black high school. It became his goal to make the educational opportunities provided to blacks equal to the quality that was provided to whites.Holley, J. W. (1948).

Specifically, Holley worked closely with Caroline Putnam to establish the Holley School, which still stands today.  Early life  Born in Canandaigua, New York, Holley was interested in education and reading from a young age. In 1831, she attended boarding school in Lyons, NY, where she there attended her first anti-slavery lecture. Yet while this was Holley's first official lecture, it was far from her first exposure to the subject. Growing up, Holley was heavily influenced by the antislavery beliefs of her father, Myron Holley, who was also a strong advocate of religious liberalism. Primarily, he served as the original founder of the Liberty Party, which was the first political party to make anti-slavery a political issue.  Education  Holley's inspiration for her later abolitionist work further strengthened when she continued her education at Oberlin College in 1847, where she encountered a biracial school community in an attempt to pursue a classical curriculum. At Oberlin, Holley also met Caroline Putnam, who quickly became Holley's lifelong companion and later work partner. After graduating in 1851, Holley became an avid member of the American Anti-Slavery Society. This proved to be a rare feat at the time, for not only did women rarely advocate for their freedom or that of others, but they even more rarely did so publicly, like Holley. Consequently, upon graduation, Holley traveled on a lecture circuit discussing the importance of abolition with Putnam by her side. Yet after this lecture circuit, Putnam decided to focus on teaching, specifically those now freedmen of Lottsburg, VA.  Career  Even while teaching, Holley continued to motivate and influence others through her speeches and thoughts. Specifically, after an 1851 speech Holley gave at a church service about anti-slavery and the abolitionist movement, one person wrote, > Miss Holley gave us an earnest, powerful, and deeply interesting address. > Everybody gave the best possible attention, and as she related several > thrilling and affecting facts, the big tears coursed down many a cheek. It > was a time of stirring sympathy and awakening interest in the cause of the > oppressed and crushed slave. At the close she offered a very touching and > simple prayer, all with the desire to put an end to what she coined as the > \\"atrocious hatred of color.\\"  Legacy  After having followed Putnam to Lottsburg, VA, Holley purchased the land in 1869 for what soon became a more permanent location of the Holley Graded School. Modeled after Oberlin, the Holley School served as a private institution with both an integrated faculty and student body, where younger students attended classes during the day and older students attended classes at night. Putnam received ownership of the grounds of the Holley School when Holley died in 1893, who then passed the land to a black board of trustees upon her death in order to continue to promote black education. The Lottsburg school district then shortly oversaw the operations of the school. Because of a growing student body, renovations were made to the school in 1922 and finished in 1933, building the Holley School schoolhouse that now stands as a community center today.

He was president of gay rights group the Mattachine Society in the 1960s. He conceptualized and led the \\"Sip-In\\" at Julius' Bar, one of the earliest acts of gay civil disobedience in the United States, LGBT activists used \\"sip-ins\\" to attempt to gain the legal right to drink in bars in New York. He was also known for being the first gay reporter to publish an account of the Stonewall Riots and the first person to interview Bette Midler in print media. Life and career Early life Richard Joseph Leitsch (who also went by Richard Valentine Leitsch, adopting a family name as his middle name) was born on May 11, 1935, in Louisville, Kentucky to Joseph Leitsch, who owned a wholesale tobacco business, and Ann (Moran) Leitsch. Richard, known as Dick, had three younger siblings. Leitsch's desire from childhood to live in New York City was influenced by movies and live radio broadcasts based in New York. Leitsch later said that he first experienced attraction towards boys in elementary school, then had his first sexual experiences as a student at Flaget High School. Though he lived in a Catholic setting with his family and accounts vary as to whether he came out to his parents explicitly, they were broadly accepting and unusually progressive for the time. Leitsch graduated from high school in 1953 and went on to Bellarmine University, though he did not finish his degree. Move to New York Leitsch moved to New York City in 1959. While cruising down Greenwich Avenue, Leitsch encountered an attractive man named Craig Rodwell who invited Leitsch back to his apartment. The two eventually began a love affair. Leitsch would call Rodwell and ask him if he wanted to go to the movies, only to be told by Rodwell that he was going to the Mattachine meetings. Initially, Leitsch laughed. He had been to a Mattachine meeting in 1962 where he heard Albert Ellis give a lecture on homosexuality as an illness. Leitsch felt revolted when Ellis received a standing ovation and had no further interest in an organization which he viewed as out of step with the times. Eventually though, in an effort to spend more time with Rodwell, Leitsch agreed to attend Mattachine meetings with him. Eventually Leitsch became an active member of Mattachine, putting in many hours of volunteering. Mattachine years Inspired by a fiery and eloquent speech given by Frank Kameny advocating for the gay rights movement to model themselves after the highly successful Civil Rights Movement, Julian Hodges organized a group to run for election. Hodges would run for President, and Leitsch as President-Elect. Initially reluctant, Leitsch eventually agreed to run on the ticket. In his statement of intent, Leitsch promised to work on ending police entrapment of gay men and various forms of discrimination. The progressive platform proved right for the times and the ticket swept the May elections. Unexpectedly, Julian Hodges stepped down later that year. In the course of less than a year, Leitsch went from a reluctant President-Elect to President of Mattachine-New York. These events occurred around the same time that John Lindsay was inaugurated as the Mayor of New York City. Leitsch worked behind the scenes frequently with the new mayor on gay issues in the city. =The Sip-In= Inspired by the lunch counter sit-ins in the south, Leitsch conceptualized the \\"sip-in\\". On April 21, 1966, members of the New York Chapter of the Mattachine Society staged a \\"sip-in\\" aiming to change the legal landscape. Dick Leitsch, the society's president, Craig Rodwell the society's vice president, and Mattachine activist John Timmons planned to draw attention to the practice by identifying themselves as homosexuals before ordering a drink in order to bring court scrutiny to the regulation. Leitsch is said to have stated: \\"We are homosexuals. We are orderly, we intend to remain orderly, and we are asking for service.\\" Exterior view of Julius' Bar, location of the Sip-In. The three first targeted the Ukrainian-American Village Restaurant at St. Mark's Place and Third Avenue in the East Village, Manhattan which had a sign, \\"If you are gay, please go away.\\" In Leitsch's words, \\"being gay, we got there late\\" when the three showed up after a New York Times reporter had asked a manager about the protest and the manager had closed the restaurant for the day.Before Stonewall: Remembering that, before the riots, there was a Sip-In The Village Voice. June 17, 2008. They then targeted a Howard Johnson's and a bar called Waikiki where they were served in spite of the note, with a bartender saying later, \\"How do I know they're homosexual? They ain't doing nothing homosexual.\\" Frustrated, they then went to Julius, where a clergyman had been arrested a few days earlier for soliciting sex. The group was joined there by Mattachine member Randy Wicker,Before the Stonewall Uprising, There Was the 'Sip-In' Retrieved August 31, 2017 as well as a New York Times reporter and a Village Voice photographer, Fred W. McDarrah. A sign in the window read, \\"This is a raided premises.\\" The bartender initially started preparing them a drink, but then put his hand over the glass which McDarrah then photographed, after Leitsch announced, \\"We are homosexuals.\\" He went on, \\"We are orderly, we intend to remain orderly, and we are asking for service.\\" The New York Times ran a headline the next day \\"3 Deviates Invite Exclusion by Bars.\\" The Mattachines then challenged the liquor rule in court and the courts ruled that gays had a right to peacefully assemble, which undercut the previous SLA contention that the presence of gay clientele automatically was grounds for charges of operating a \\"disorderly\\" premise. Although the court battle did not result in as clean a decision as the men hoped for, the event itself fueled hope within the queer community as perhaps the first open act of gay civil disobedience. Although gay bars eventually became legal after a similar sip-in challenge in New Jersey, police still made excuses to raid gay bars. The National Park Service Register of Historic Places for Julius' Bar states: \\"Scholars of gay history consider the sip-in at Julius‚Äô as a key event leading to the growth of legitimate gay bars and the development of the bar as the central social space for urban gay men and lesbians.\\" The bar now holds a monthly party called \\"Mattachine\\" honoring the early gay rights pioneers. Journalism =Stonewall riots= During the Stonewall riots, Leitsch was the first gay journalist to report on the riot. On June 28, 1969, Leitsch witnessed the Stonewall riots in Greenwich Village after taking a cab and walking there after hearing on a late night radio broadcast that trouble was brewing outside a Greenwich Village gay bar. After the police cleared the area, he returned to the Mattachine offices and wrote about the riots, thus being the first person to talk about the event. Initially his account was printed as a special Mattachine newsletter to be distributed among Mattachine-New York members, but then a copy of Leitsch's account was published in the September 1969 issue of The Advocate. From the published account: > Momentarily, 50 or more homosexuals who would have been described as \\"nelly\\" > rushed the cops and took the boy back into the crowd. They then formed a > solid front and refused to let the cops into the crowd to regain their > prisoner, letting the cops hit them with their sticks, rather than let them > through. It was an interesting side-light on the demonstrations that those > usually put down as \\"sissies\\" or \\"swishes\\" showed the most courage and sense > during the action. Their bravery and daring saved many people from being > hurt, and their sense of humor and \\"camp\\" helped keep the crowds from > getting too nasty or too violent. =Bette Midler= Leitsch wrote frequently for the first gay newspaper based in New York City, named Gay. His editor and the owner of Gay pushed him to interview a then-unknown singer by the name of Bette Midler. The interview was published in the October 26, 1970, edition of the paper, titled \\"The Whole World's a Bath!\\". It was the first interview of Bette Midler ever published. The Boys in the Band, Zachary Quinto, Matt Bomer and Andrew Rannells, 2018.  Other work and retirement  During this pre-Stonewall era, anyone who was publicly homosexual had great difficulty staying employed in white-collar positions. Due to being publicly gay, even in interviews, Leitsch took whatever jobs provided a livable income. He primarily worked as a bartender but held various occupations including journalist, author, painter and holiday decorator. He retired in 2000, thereafter volunteering much of his time at the Episcopal Church of Saint Mary the Virgin in Manhattan. Personal life and death Leitsch's long-time partner was Timothy Scofield. They were together for 17 years before Scofield died in 1989 following an AIDS diagnosis. In April 2018, Leitsch donated his personal papers as well as a large number of Mattachine papers to the New York Public Library, following his terminal cancer diagnosis. Lietsch died from liver cancer in Manhattan on June 22, 2018.

Herklots studied medicine and biology at the University of Leiden. In 1846 he was appointed as curator of invertebrates at the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie in Leiden, succeeding Wilhem de Haan, a position which he held until his death in 1872, his successor was Christiaan Karel Hoffmann. In June 1851 he graduated as a Doctor of Philosophy, and his an dissertation was entitled Additamenta ad faunam carcinologicam Africa occidentalis on the crustaceans from the Guinea coast, based on samples brought to the Netherlands by Hendrik Pel. In 1861 he published a museum catalogue of crustaceans from the system of Wilhem de Haan. He was also the author of important works on coelenterates , especially sea pens (Pennatulacea), and both modern and fossil taxa of echinoderms. In 1854 the Museum established its divided the Department of Invertebrates into a Department of Non-Articulata, of which Herklots remained the curator and a Department of Articulata where Samuel Constantinus Snellen van Vollenhoven (1816-1880) was curator. In July 1860, the Department of Invertebrates was reorganized and van Vollenhoven became head of the entomological department, while Herklots became head of Arthropoda Non-Insecta, the position he held until his death. Herklots provided important contributions on invertebrate animals. His work was somewhat overshadowed by that of de Haan. However, in contrast to De Haan, Herklots was very interested in the Dutch invertebrate fauna. The Natural History Museum in Leiden has several invertebrate specimens collected by Herklots on Noordwijk beach. Herklots married Antoinetta Johanna Agatha Susanna, the daughter of the former museum director Joannes Andreas Susanna. Herklots was a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences, the Dutch Society of Sciences in Haarlem, and several other learned societies. He died in 1872 after a long illness, probably tuberculosis. Selected works *Herklots, J.

It combines anthropology and first-hand accounts from mothers and doctors into a critical analysis of childbirth in America from a feminist perspective. It introduces the theme of technocratic medicine as a form of indoctrination into America's patriarchal culture. Davis-Floyd argues that American birthing practices value science over nature, a doctor's knowledge over that of the mother and that many common actions performed by doctors (or the mother) are technocratic rituals ‚Äì behaviors with limited practical purpose. She cites practices such as obstructing the mother's line of sight to the baby exiting her body by placing a sheet over her lower body. Davis-Floyd believes that society, intimidated by women's ability to give birth, has designed unnecessary rituals in order to make the symbolism of childbirth available to everyone, not just those who can bear children. \\"In this way,\\" she writes, \\"society symbolically demonstrates ownership of its product.\\"  Key concepts  Technology in birth Major life transitions are often ritualized in a way that is local to a particular society or culture.Davis-Floyd, Robbie. \\"The Rituals of American Hospital Birth,\\" ‚Äò‚ÄôConformity and Conflict: Readings in Cultural Anthropology‚Äô‚Äô (1994) pp 1-20. Pregnancy and childbirth are processes that reflect the traditions, beliefs, and values of the culture in which they take place. Davis-Floyd argues that the emphasis on technological advances that aid pregnancy, create a negative effect surrounding its ideology. The book argues that American society values the knowledge of medical professionals over that of mothers and midwives. Davis-Floyd's model criticizes current tocology and childbirth as overly scientific, technology-motivated methods that can serve to disempower women. Certain medical procedures such as a cesarean section, episiotomy, and the positioning of the woman at the time of birth, are viewed as optimal in American birthing culture. Davis-Floyd argues that these procedures are mainly a result of cultural beliefs, and not for their actual benefits. The same is true of the perception that pregnancy and childbirth require medical oversight and interference. Davis-Floyd claims that the majority of women's favorable views of technological intervention during childbirth are due to doctors' influence. Obstetric procedures act as rituals for pregnant women and medical personnel, with the intention of improving the attitudes of those involved in birthing. For example, when fluids are administered through intravenous therapy, a feeling of security is invoked; a reassuring order is imposed on the event, reinforcing reliance upon others' knowledge. Rite of passage The concept of a rite of passage was coined by ethnographer Arnold van Gennep. Davis-Floyd states that birth as a rite of passage incorporates three essential stages. Through birth, the treatment of the woman's body, and the doctor's implementation of procedures, the rite is enacted within American culture. Stages The three stages are separation, pregnancy and reincorporation. These three stages characterize the rite of passage and are culturally relative to the society within which they function. In some cases four stages apply, and in rare cases, up to ten. However, such cases have never been recorded. Separation: A phase during which the pregnant woman begins to form a new self-identity as a result of her pregnancy. She separates from her original state of being. In this stage, the woman is now an \\"other\\", unlike her old self. Pregnancy: A phase where the pregnant woman is \\"in between\\". She is neither a normal member of society nor a mother. This stage continues until after the birth. Integration: The woman accepts her new social identity. This phase ends when the woman feels that she is similar to her previous self.  Reception  Reviews of this book praised Davis-Floyd for connecting American childbirth with rituals using an anthropological basis. The book also received criticism for basing its conclusions on interviews with only 100 women who were all well-educated, middle-class and Caucasian.

The impact killed twenty-nine people and injured eleven others, making the avalanche the deadliest in Italy since the White Friday avalanches in 1916, and the deadliest avalanche in Europe since the Galt√ºr avalanche in 1999. Two causal factors for the avalanche of 2017 include a series of earthquakes that struck the region earlier in the day and the record snowfall which occurred in the region for days prior to the avalanche.  Avalanche  It was reported that shortly after a series of earthquakes hit the region, many of the hotel guests were gathered on the ground floor of the hotel awaiting evacuation when the avalanche struck. At the time, there were forty people in the hotel including twenty-eight guests and twelve employees. Upon impact, the avalanche caused part of the roof of the hotel to collapse, and moved it down the mountain. Italian authorities estimated that the avalanche weighed between 40,000 and 60,000 tonnes when it hit the hotel and that the weight of the snow increased to 120,000 tonnes as the snow and ice pressing down on the building became heavier. Upon impact to the hotel the speed was around . Rigopiano Hotel before and after the avalanche The avalanche largely destroyed the four-star resort, killing twenty-nine people. A total of eleven people were rescued following the avalanche, including two people who survived the avalanche because they were standing outside the hotel when the avalanche hit. The survivors trapped inside the hotel, sheltered by lofts that had not collapsed, were located around 12:00 on 20 January, over 30 hours after the avalanche. Overall, five adults and four children trapped below the ruins and the snow were rescued, the last ones after 58 hours, having survived on frozen snow. Ten out of the eleven people rescued received minor injuries related to hypothermia. The eleventh person also received a compression injury to his upper arm, which he underwent surgery for. On 23 January, rescuers recovered a twelfth body, but also located three puppies alive under the snow, indicating that the twenty-two people missing may have still been alive. However, it was later revealed that no one else had survived the avalanche. One of the victims, as reported from a text message in her smartphone, survived over 40 hours.  Response  Due to harsh conditions that inhibited helicopters from flying, first responders had difficulty reaching the hotel due to large amounts of snow which had fallen for several days prior to the accident. In addition, the presence of trunks and rubble on the streets slowed down the snow blower, so that the first rescuers arrived at the scene at 04:30 local time (03:30 GMT) on Ski and stated that the hotel had been buried under at least of snow, and that it could take days before they would know if there were any survivors. In addition, the base camp for rescue workers with ambulances was set up approximately away. Individuals from Emergency Services, Civil Protection, Alpine Rescue and Volunteers including asylum seekers worked with technology to track body heat, phone signals and other data, and drones to locate victims. After two days of working Emergency Personnel made contact with six survivors in an air pocket of the destroyed hotel and managed to rescue them. Five days after the avalanche, three puppies from the hotels resident dogs were found and rescued by workers, and reunited with their parents; Lupo (Wolf) and Nuvola (Cloud) who had escaped and found shelter in Farindola a nearby village. Individuals saw the puppies as signs of hope, but officials warned that their survival did not mean that more human survivors would be found.  Controversy  There was criticism over the amount of time it took emergency services to respond to the accident. A survivor who had remained outside the hotel following the avalanche called authorities for help, but allegedly Italian authorities did not at first believe that the accident had happened. Quintino Marcella, the owner of the restaurant L'Isola Felice in Silvi, received a call from the survivor and attempted to contact authorities on numerous occasions but was purportedly not taken seriously. On 23 January, local newspapers reported that prior to the avalanche, the owner of the hotel sent an email to local authorities expressing his concern for the hotel guests due to their panicky nature following the earthquakes. He stated that many hotel guests were planning on spending the night in their cars, out in the open.  Legal  On 22 January, the mayor of Farindola, Ilario Lacchetta, announced that he was planning on filing a lawsuit against the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo for publishing a cartoon allegedly mocking victims of the disaster. The cartoon depicts Death riding the avalanche down the mountain on skis holding two scythes instead of ski poles. Lacchetta stated that the cartoon \\"goes beyond bad taste,\\" and was just as offensive as a similar satirical cartoon published by the same company, which mocked victims of the Amatrice earthquake in August 2016. Prosecutors launched a manslaughter investigation of the failure of authorities to respond to reports of an avalanche for many hours. In addition, an investigation was launched to determine whether Hotel Rigopiano was built on the debris of several previous avalanches which had taken a similar route down the mountain, therefore putting the hotel in danger. On 31 January, Italian judges announced that autopsies revealed that almost all of the victims died immediately from the impact of the avalanche itself, rather than succumbing to hypothermia in the days following the disaster.  Memorials  A year after the incident on January 18, 2018, victims relatives, local residents and representatives of the authorities and emergency services read prayers, poems and laid flowers outside the remains of the hotel during the Commemoration Day. There was also a display of those killed, with the words \\"Never Again\\" and photos of the victims. A family of survivors, the Parete's wrote a book about their experience Il Peso Della Neve.

In 1993 it became an independent NGO and took its current name.  Historical background  In 1951, Jerome D'Souza, an educator and member of the Indian Constituent Assembly, founded the Indian Institute of Social Order in Pune, India, to contribute to the emergence of a new social order in post-independence India. Regional training centres were established in various parts of the country, including Bangalore. In 1963 the Institute in Pune moved to New Delhi and in 1967 became Indian Social Institute. Extension services increased especially in the southern states around Bangalore, giving assistance to the cooperative movement and offering consultancy services for development agencies, among other programs. Trainees spent up to three months learning the process of social analysis and skills for social mobilization. Numerous action groups emerged, trained at ISI-B, such as the fisherman's movement in Kerala. Since the 1980s the Documentation Centre of Indian Social Institute functioned out of Bangalore furnishing documentation for activists throughout India. By 1993 the need was realized to make the Indian Social Institute in Bangalore a separate NGO.

The union was founded in 1872 as the Amalgamated Stove, Grate and Kitchen Range Fitters' Protection Society. It hoped to compete with the Amalgamated Society of Engineers by restricting its membership to those in a specific trade, but was also less selective in deciding the qualifications for membership.Arthur Marsh and Victoria Ryan, Historical Directory of Trade Unions, vol.2, p.111-112 The union survived, but remained very small for many years with only 360 by the end of the century. It changed its name to the Amalgamated Society of Kitchen Range, Hot Water, Art Metal and Other Fitters Concerned with the Above Trades in 1887, then to the United Society of Fitters and Smiths in 1898. In 1908, the Amalgamated Society of Whitesmiths, Domestic Engineers and General Pipe Fitters and the Birmingham Society of Hot Water and Steam Engineers merged into the union, which changed its name to the National Union of Operative Heating and Domestic Engineers, Whitesmiths and General Iron Workers. It relocated its head office to Birmingham, and was finally able to claim a membership of more than 1,000 workers.

Manyoma had been an outspoken critic of right-wing paramilitaries and mining and agricultural corporations. Manyoma's work involved the rights of people displaced by drug trafficking. She had also been working for the Colombian Truth Commission, documenting murder and disappearances. She was assassinated in January 2017, along with Joe Javier Rodallega, her partner.

While serving as United States Attorney for the District of Maryland, he prosecuted Vice President of the United States Spiro Agnew for bribery. This prosecution ultimately led to Agnew's resignation as Vice President in 1973. Background Beall was born in Frostburg, Maryland, on August 17, 1937 to his parents, future U.S. Senator James Glenn Beall and the former Margaret Schwarzenbach. He was one of three sons, the eldest also being a future U.S. Senator from Maryland, John Glenn Beall Jr.. Beall received his undergraduate degree from Princeton University in 1959; and his law degree from the University of Virginia School of Law, in 1963. Two years later, he married Nancy Roche in late December. He died in Naples, Florida on January 15, 2017. Career After clerking for Chief Judge Simon E. Sobeloff of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, Beall became a trial lawyer for a Maryland law firm. In 1968, Spiro Agnew, the Governor of Maryland at the time, appointed Beall, a fellow Republican, to the Maryland Criminal Injuries Compensation Board. Beall was appointed United States attorney in June 1970, initially on an interim basis. Though he had never prosecuted a single case, Beall proved to be, in the words of his predecessor, a \\"tough act to follow\\" as United States Attorney for the District of Maryland: among other cases and investigations, he indicted and prosecuted Arthur Bremer for the shooting of presidential candidate, and Governor of Alabama, George Wallace; as well as a state legislator turned drug dealer; and Spiro Agnew, by then the Vice President of the United States. Agnew investigation Two years after Beall took office, he opened an investigation into corruption in Baltimore County of public officials and architects, engineers, and paving contractors. One contractor, Lester Matz, stated that he had been paying \\"Agnew kickbacks in exchange for contracts for years ‚Äî first when Agnew was the Baltimore County Executive, then when he was Governor of Maryland and Vice President.\\" Another witness, Jerome B. Wolff, head of Maryland's roads commission, stated that his attic was filled with documentation that detailed \\"every corrupt payment he participated in with then-Governor Agnew.\\" Despite being pressured by the White House and his brother (now a senator), Beall continued to allow his investigators to continue their work.https://www.nbcnews.com/msnbc/maddow- bag-man-podcast/transcript-episode-4-turn-it-n935286. Agnew resigned as Vice President and pleaded no contest to tax evasion in the sum of $13,551.47 for 1967. He was fined $10,000 and avoided prison time. Private practice Beall resigned on March 31, 1975, and returned to private practice, specializing in commercial litigation. His clients included the Baltimore Ravens while owned by Art Modell. In 1978, he worked as campaign chairman for his brother's failed run for Governor of Maryland.

It was described by the Finnish-born Russian botanist and entomologist Christian von Steven in 1857. Description Quercus hartwissiana is a large deciduous tree, reaching heights of , with umbrella- shaped crown and ascending branches. The bark is thick, finely furrowed, almost black. The shoots are dark reddish-brown and bald. The buds are broad, oval or almost round, 6 to 7 mm long, with short burnished scales. The petiole is 1.5 to 2 cm long. The leafs are 12 to 14 cm long and 7 to 9 cm wide, slightly convex in the base, and have seven to ten pairs of fairly regular, short, rounded to pointed lobes. The leaf veins are all directed into the lobes of the leaf, not into the indentations between them. The top of the leaf is bright green, the underside is dull, with a dark brown shading, with fine fleece and somewhat longer reddish hairs along the leaf veins, or in the angles between them. On a petiole with a length of 2 to 7 cm, there are one to four acorns. Their fruits mature in the first year. The acorns are 2.5 to 3 cm long and 1.2 to 1.5 cm wide, the fruit cups measure 1.5 cm in length and 2 cm in diameter. The scales of the fruit cup are almost full to the top. Distribution A Quercus hartwissiana habitat in Strandzha Nature Park, Bulgaria Quercus hartwissiana is found in the Euxine-Colchic deciduous forests ecoregion, in the temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome along the Black Sea from the south-easternmost parts of the Balkan Peninsula along northern Asia Minor to western Caucasus. It grows in Bulgaria, Turkey, Georgia and Russia. In Bulgaria Quercus hartwissiana grows in Strandzha Nature Park and is distributed in the dense forest ecotype and the karst or xelophilous ecotype. In Strandzha it grows near river valleys, especially those of Veleka and Rezovo. There it is mixed with Carpinus betulus, Fagus orientalis, Sorbus torminalis, Quercus pubescens, Quercus cerris, Quercus frainetto, Carpinus orientalis and the shrubs Cistus creticus and Daphne pontica. In Russia it occurs in the basin of the Mzymta River and in the North Caucasus. In Georgia it is known from Abkhazia, Racha-Lechkhumi and Kvemo Svaneti, Samegrelo, Imereti, Guria and Adjara; in eastern Georgia it is now known only from Kakheti. It always occurs in mixed forests along with other tree species. Quercus hartwissiana prefers warm and humid climate and grows on fresh to moist soil from the lowland to a height of 1200 to 1500 m. It is a pre-glacial relict and is considered to be the ancestor of Quercus robur and Quercus petraea. Fossil record Fossils of Quercus hartwissiana have been described from the fossil flora of Kƒ±zƒ±lcahamam district in Turkey, which is of early Pliocene age.

Pezzullo is an American author and scholar working as an Associate Professor of Communication at the University of Colorado Boulder. She specializes in environmental communication and rhetoric, public advocacy, tourist studies, and cultural studies.  Background  Pezzullo earned her M.A. in 1998 and her Ph.D. in 2002 from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, both in Communication Studies. She also holds a B.A. in Social Thought and Political Economy and a B.S. in Natural Resources from the University of Massachusetts Amherst (1996).  Professional life  From 2002 to 2015, Pezzullo held academic appointments at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana. In 2015, Pezzullo accepted an appointment in the Department of Communication at the University of Colorado Boulder, where she currently holds the position of Associate Professor. As of Spring 2017, Pezzullo has served on the editorial board of several academic journals, including Cultural Studies, Communication and Critical/Cultural Studies, Communication Monographs, Environmental Communication, and Quarterly Journal of Speech. In addition to book awards, Pezzullo has received awards from the National Communication Association and from Indiana University for teaching and service.  Scholarly works  Pezzullo has brought attention to the modern issues of environmental justice in a world of consumerism and political economics. She discusses and analyzes these topics in terms of communication and social effects (along with their interaction with demographics like race and gender) in her book, Toxic Tourism: Rhetorics of Travel, Pollution, and Environmental Justice (2007), and in many of her published articles. Toxic Tourism won the Jane Jacobs Urban Communication Book Award (Urban Communication Foundation, 2010), the James A. Winans-Herbert A. Wichelns Memorial Award for Distinguished Scholarship in Rhetoric/Public Address (National Communication Association, 2007), the Christine L. Oravec Research Award in Environmental Communication (NCA, 2007), and the Book of the Year Award for the Critical and Cultural Studies Division (NCA, 2007). With Robert Cox she coauthored Environmental Communication and the Public Sphere, 4th Edition (2016), a textbook in the environmental communication field. The book discusses the history and development of the field of environmental communication, the modern implications of the field, and the ways humans and the environment interact with and influence each other. It also talks about how human beings react to environmental issues or problems, and how we choose to act in relation to these perceived problems. Environmental Justice and Environmentalism: The Social Justice Challenge to the Environmental Movement (2007), which Pezzullo edited alongside philosophy professor Ronald Sandler, discusses the tensions and angles of two intertwined movements of environmentalism and environmental justice. The former has been criticized by the latter for perceived racism, elitism, and lack of humanitarian concern. The text also analyzes both sides in context of changing climate, environmental laws, and attitudes in the US. Related to Pezzullo's environmental focus is her concern with \\"pinkwashing\\", a phenomenon discussed in her article \\"Resisting 'National Breast Cancer Awareness Month': The Rhetoric of Counterpublics and their Cultural Performances\\". The idea of pinkwashing centers on businesses' disingenuous participation in National Breast Cancer Awareness Month not out of concern for health, but for purposes of cosmetic targeting, gendered performance, and public relations. Pezzullo says these campaigns fail to address environmental pollution as a large cause of breast cancer, possibly because the corporations in question contribute to this very pollution. Pinkwashing a campaign is a way for businesses to appear moral while earning more money from consumers who believe they are contributing to a just cause, as the campaigns increasingly focus on gendered images of beauty, breasts, and pink imagery.

It is around 4,800 light years away. WR 9 is a binary with two components in a circular 14-day orbit. The Wolf-Rayet component is often identified as the primary because it dominates the spectrum with its broad emission lines, although it is less massive, less luminous, and less visually bright than its companion. The companion is an approximately O7 star. The spectrum is dominated by broad emission lines, those of CIV being the strongest, followed by HeII. CIII lines are seen but much weaker. OV lines are also stronger than CIII. The classification is usually given as WC4, although it has previously been assigned as WC5. By comparison, the absorption lines of the secondary star are narrower and weaker, although at blue and shorter wavelengths they become stronger than the WR lines. The spectral type of the secondary can be set at O7. The luminosity class cannot be determined clearly, although it has been suggested to be a supergiant. The Wolf-Rayet star shows no hydrogen in its spectrum and is thought to be hydrogen-free. It is calculated to consist of 42% helium and 58% heavier elements, mostly carbon and oxygen. WR 9 is listed as an eclipsing binary in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars, as well as having the more irregular brightness changes frequently seen in Wolf Rayet stars. The total amplitude is only 0.04 magnitudes. The eclipses are so shallow because only the atmosphere of the WR star eclipses the O star on each orbit.

She is mostly known for her contributions to muted group theory, as well as A Feminist Dictionary, in which she was a co-author. Kramarae received her B.S. from South Dakota State University, her M.A. at Ohio University and received her Ph.D. in communication and sociolinguistics at the University of Illinois, Urbana- Champaign. She is currently a visiting professor at the Center for the Study of Women in Society at the University of Oregon, as well as a professor emerita in communication and gender studies at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.  Early life and education  Kramarae was born in Brookings, South Dakota. Karmarae got her B.S. from South Dakota State University, her M.A. from Ohio University. In 1975, Kramarae got her Ph.D. in communication and social linguistics from University of Illinois, Urbana- Champaign. Currently at University of Oregon, Eugene.  Teaching career  Upon completing her doctorate, Kramarae accepted a position in 1978 at the University of Illinois Urbana as an associate professor, teaching speech communication through 1985. In 1988, she moved on to the University of Oregon, where she was the acting director for the Center for the Study of Women in Society. From 1991 to 1996, Kramarae was at the University of Illinois, where she was the co-founder and co-organizer of the Women, Information Technology & Scholarship (WITS) Center for Advanced Study. She was also the director of the Women's Studies program at the University of Illinois, beginning in 1993, as well as Jubilee Professor or Liberal Arts & Social Sciences at the University of Illinois. She is currently a visiting professor for the Center for the Study of Women in Society, at the University of Oregon, where she has been since 1996. She worked as the International Dean at the Women's University in Germany.  Research  Kramarae's research has been primarily focused on gender, language, communication, technology, and education. Her research focuses on taking a look at women experience in higher education. With her research, she has published many books and articles on the concepts of women communication via technology, and how that can differ between genders. Kramarae is mostly known though, for her contributions to muted group theory, as well as A Feminist Dictionary.  Muted Group Theory  Kramarae is most widely known for her contributions to muted group theory (MTG). This theory looks at power and how different groups use it. This theory begins with the premise that language is culture-based, and since men are seen to have more power than women, men have been seen to have power over language, resulting with a male-biased language. MTG breaks down into three assumptions: * Men and women perceive the world differently because they have different perception shaping experiences. * Men enact their power politically, using their power to suppress women's ideas from gaining public awareness. * Women must then convert their voices into language that is considered male. Upon this definition of MGT, Kramarae made the widely accepted claim that language is a tool made by men and used by a dominant culture to marginalize other groups and to deter them from full participation in their given societies.  A Feminist Dictionary  Kramarae is also well known for co-authoring A Feminist Dictionary. This is an alternative dictionary compiled by Kramarae, Ann Russo, and Paula Tredichler. This dictionary includes over 2,500 separate words and definitions from a feminist perspective. This book has since been reprinted as Amazons, Bluestockings and Crones: A Feminist Dictionary.  Activism  In 1977, became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media.

Straddling the border of Boone County and Lincoln County in the Appalachian Mountains, the Hobet 21 mine was one of the largest mountaintop-removal coal mining operations in West Virginia. Originally owned by Fil Nutter, the mine used both underground mining and strip mining techniques, and later even more intensive surface mining using a dragline. Increasing productivity and profitability encouraged workers to successfully strike for their health plan in 1993, which resulted in unusually thorough coverage for mine workers at this time. The Hobet mine was incorporated into Arch Coal in 1997, along with several other mines, following booming coal demand. The mine was sold two more times: to Magnum Coal in 2005 and to Patriot Coal in 2008. Patriot Coal subsequently went bankrupt in 2015, and the Hobet site was passed into a Virginia-based conservation firm who continued to mine the land while reclaiming and planting trees to offset carbon emissions for other companies. The Hobet 21 Coal Mine site is currently defunct and in 2016, former West Virginia Governor Earl Ray Tomblin proposed developing the environmentally degraded former coal field. This residential, industrial and commercial development plan is intended to offset the economic impacts from the declining coal industry, but has been called \\"a long way from reality\\".Hobet Coal Mine in September 1984.  History   General history  Coal mining has been a primary industry of West Virginia since coal was first discovered in Boone County in 1742, by John Peter Salley. The Hobet 21 mine itself was not opened until 1974. The mine was a small, family business under its original owners, Fil Nutter and Granville Lee Linville. It was subsequently sold off four times, to Ashland Oil (1977), Arch Coal (1997), Magnum Coal (2005), and Patriot Coal (2008). Under the ownership of Ashland Oil, a new, more intensive form of mining using a dragline was introduced, which commenced operation in 1983 and doubled production. A highly successful business enterprise, Hobet coal reached its peak value in the early 2010s. In 2014 the Virginia Conservation Legacy Fund reclaimed what was left of Patriot Coal. VCLF's ERP Compliant Fuels was granted rights for 150 mining permits across Appalachia in exchange for assuming responsibility of the $400 million worth of miner health care liabilities that Patriot Coal was previously responsible for.  Union  Hobet miners were involved in the United Mine Workers' (UMW) selective strike in 1993, which included workers from five states. At the time, just 30% of mining was union protected, and miners struggled to maintain their power. Hobet's union ultimately accepted lower wages in exchange for an \\"exceptional\\" health plan. Another major UMW protest took place in 2015, at the Patriot Coal headquarters. Workers objected to the bankrupted Patriot's intentions to sell its assets to Blackhawk Mining, canceling contracts, benefits, and retiree pensions in the process. Patriot Coal claimed the miners would probably have job opportunities at Blackhawk, or with the conservation group, Virginia Conservation Legacy Fund, that is panning to restore former Hobet mine lands‚Äîbut that was not guaranteed.  Environmental justice activism  The Last Mountain, a 2011 documentary about a neighboring Boone County coal mine, brought the broader area's struggle for environmental justice into the limelight. In 2012, a grassroots activist group called Radical Action for Mountain People's Survival (RAMPS), organized a protest in which some 50 people shut down the Hobet mine, resulting in 20 arrests. The protesters stood up against the environmental degradation taking place through mountaintop removal mining techniques, and were especially angry about effects on the health of nearby human populations. These low-income populations have been inundated with poisonous carcinogenic water and air pollution from the mine. A 2016 study found that populations in greater proximity to both present and past coal mining sites in Appalachia have greater exposure to environmental hazards. Because these areas are primarily low income, this is a form of environmental inequality. Hobet Coal Mine in June 2009.  Economics   Output and employment  In 1975, the Hobet mine produced less than 90,000 tons of coal. This number significantly increased to almost 500,000 tons three years later. At its peak in 2002, the mine produced 5 million tons of coal. Alongside the output of the mine, the number of employees increased as well. Employing less than 50 workers at its inception, the mine employed more than 200 by 1982. However, in 1993, in order to secure their health benefits, the workers went on strike from May to December. Both output and the number of workers plummeted, but they were restored in 1994 after the strike ended.  Bankruptcy  With an increase in the availability of natural gas (due to hydraulic fracturing technologies), as well a rising use of renewable energy sources, world demand for coal is decreasing. From 2007 to 2016, U.S. fossil fuel consumption decreased by nearly one-third. In recent years, bankruptcy has become epidemic among United States coal companies. Patriot Coal, the owner of the mine at the time, announced its bankruptcy in 2012, resulting in the loss of health benefits for the miners. The company cited competition from natural gas, a weak economy, and regulations as the main factors of their bankruptcy. Patriot obtained bankruptcy financing and advice in order to survive. In August 2015, Patriot filed Chapter 11 with the Bankruptcy Court. In October 2015, a Virginia bankruptcy court approved the bankruptcy. The assets and liabilities previously owned by Patriot Coal were taken on by ERP Compliant Fuels, a subsidiary of the Virginia Conservation Legacy Fund.  Income demographics  The communities surrounding the mine are primarily low-income areas. Boone County has a poverty rate of 23%, and a per-capita income of $21,387. Lincoln County's poverty rate is higher, at 28%, with a per-capita income of $19,114. This is compared to the national average poverty rate of 14%, and the national per-capita income of $29,979. Only 8.8% of Boone County residents and 10% of Lincoln County residents have a post-secondary education. In 2014 (before Patriot Coal went bankrupt) the mining industry made up 23% of industry in Boone County, and was the largest sector in the county.  Environmental and health impacts   Environmental impacts  Mountaintop removal causes multiple environmental problems including deforestation, decapitated peaks, significant carbon dioxide emissions, contamination of the air with sulfur, and biodiversity loss; but one of the most significant is the damage caused to waterways that support mountain ecosystems. Coal companies clear-cut the ecologically diverse forest and then use dynamite to remove mountaintops and pile the waste rock into mountain valleys, creating dams called valley fills. In particular, the Connelly Branch of the Mud River was nearly completely filled in. The Hobet mine has been operating in the Mud River watershed since the 1970s, and has been more destructive to the surrounding ecosystems than any other mine in Appalachia. More than 20 of these valley fills containing high levels of conductivity pollution‚Äîin conjunction with deforested mountainsides‚Äî contribute to significant toxic runoff, which contaminates the Mud River and its numerous tributaries many miles downstream from the mine site. Even though the mine is now closed, piles of spoil and valley fills are leaching a large quantity of selenium into the surrounding watershed. Nonetheless, in 2010, the EPA reported that the mine had satisfied the requirements given in the Clean Water Act. The Obama-era Stream Protection Rule requires that landscapes affected by coal mining be restored to a condition in which it is capable of supporting the same ecosystem components and uses that the undisturbed land had previously supported. However, this rule was recently repealed, leaving restoration up to private interests. Government agency reclamation guidelines require former mine sites to be restored to the ‚Äúapproximate original contour‚Äù of the site, and replanted with biologically diverse fauna that provides comparable ecosystem services to those of the original landscape. Many companies interpret these guidelines as a call simply to bulldoze earth into place and reseed grass. Numerous reclaimed sites are now pastureland, and reforestation is rare due to this liberal interpretation of the law, as well as the fact that true ecological reclamation is very expensive. Much of the reclamation process that is done by mining companies uses crushed rock, and because this doesn‚Äôt absorb as much water as the topsoil that once covered the land, the flow of water runoff has increased during storms, washing away vegetation and soil. This is detrimental to the carbon and nitrogen cycles, impairing ecosystem function. The EPA lists 110 separate organic pollutants and 14 metals/minerals as \\"priority pollutants\\" in relation to strip mining practices. Some of the pollutants on the list include: lead, mercury, arsenic, selenium, haloethers, nitrophenols, polychlorinated biphenyls, chlorobenzene, pthalate esters, nitrosamines, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons.  Human health impacts  In communities surrounding mountaintop removal sites, pollutants often leach into the groundwater. This groundwater contamination causes health concerns. There is a link to higher rates of disease near large- scale mining sites like Hobet mine, such as cancer and birth defects, decreased birth weight, diminished educational attainment, cardiac and pulmonary disease, and significantly decreased life expectancy. The now- defunct mine site contains rubble and retaining ponds that are still producing toxic runoff. This polluted water is in danger of affecting tributaries of the Ohio river. A formerly lush ecosystem, the mine site requires many years of cleanup to become a healthful environment again. While the communities surrounding coal mines are in danger from environmental pollution-related diseases and infrastructure failures such as the Elk River chemical spill of 2014, mine workers themselves also contend with elevated risks of physical injury, hearing loss, and black lung disease.  Future developments  In 2016, then West Virginia Governor Earl Ray Tomblin proposed the development of a $140 million industrial site on the Hobet 21 site. The mountaintop removal site was selected for development for its close proximity to a four-lane highway and its relatively large size, which the governor's office cited as being important for the economic development of the area. Current Governor Jim Justice has stated that he supports going through the plan to develop the site. The proposed development plan has been controversial among environmentalist groups, as scientists have claimed that long-term pollution from the former coal operation will cause water quality problems for the users of the proposed development. In 2015 the Sierra Club, the Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition, and West Virginia Highlands Conservancy filed a lawsuit against Patriot Coal Corporation, accusing the company of releasing pollutants into water systems in the surrounding area, in particular into the Mud River, which these groups claim has become \\"biologically impaired\\" by the Hobet 21 coal mining site. In 2016 a settlement was reached between the Sierra Club, the Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition, the West Virginia Highlands Conservancy, and the Virginia Conservation Legacy Fund (VCLF), which reclaimed the remains of Patriot Coal in the wake of Patriot Coal's 2015 bankruptcy. The settlement established a $6 million stream restoration and reforestation project that VCLF was made responsible for carrying out. VCLF assumed Patriot Coal's $400 million worth in worker's compensation liabilities and environmental restoration responsibilities in exchange for multiple mining complexes in West Virginia and several mining permits. Additionally, VCLF was granted a -year extension on the previously existing deadline to treat selenium water pollution, which was the subject of the 2015 lawsuit brought up against Patriot Coal. It was also agreed that the 2015 Clean Water Act conductivity pollution enforcement case was to be postponed as part of the settlement. Despite this, development of the Hobet site is being carried out. In 2016, The West Virginia Department of Transportation requested approval for the design and development of a 2.6-mile access road to the site. Construction is expected to begin in March 2017. Tomblin named the project Rock Creek Development Park, and announced that the West Virginia National Guard will contribute to it. The Guard is expected to use the property to maintain national vehicles, train, and invest in agricultural needs such as planting apple trees and constructing greenhouses.

Background KeyBank Center marked the UFC's first return to Buffalo in almost 22 years. The event was the second that the UFC has hosted in Buffalo, the first being UFC 7 in 1995. It was the first to be held in Buffalo since the state of New York lifted its ban on professional mixed martial arts in early 2016. A UFC Light Heavyweight Championship rematch between current champion Daniel Cormier and Anthony Johnson headlined the event. The pairing met previously in May 2015 at UFC 187 with Cormier winning the fight (and the vacant title) via submission in the third round. This rematch was originally scheduled to take place at UFC 206, but Cormier pulled out due to an injury and the bout was scrapped. Controversy arose at the weigh-in as Cormier, who had initially weighed in 1.2 pounds over the 205-pound limit, minutes later weighed in at exactly 205 pounds. Video appeared to show Cormier supporting himself on a towel held by a teammate, though New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC) officials denied such allegations. After this fight, Johnson announced his retirement from the UFC and combat sports, effective immediately. Promotional newcomer Pearl Gonzalez was expected to face Cynthia Calvillo at the event. She was ruled out of the contest on the day of the weigh ins after NYSAC officials confirmed that she could not fight in the state because of her breast implants, which are banned among combat-sports competitors. Later the decision was reversed and the fight was allowed to go on as scheduled. During the main card broadcast, it was announced that former WEC Featherweight Champion and UFC Bantamweight Championship title challenger Urijah Faber will be inducted into the Modern Era wing of the UFC Hall of Fame in this year's ceremony, which takes place July 6 in the midst of the UFC's annual International Fight Week festivities. Results Bonus awards The following fighters were awarded $50,000 bonuses: *Fight of the Night: Shane Burgos vs. Charles Rosa *Performance of the Night: Charles Oliveira and Gregor Gillespie Aftermath The NYSAC issued a two-month suspension for Oliveira for hopping over the cage after defeating Brooks. On April 13, Johnson's team officially filed an appeal with the NYSAC over the controversial weigh-in of Cormier. In their appeal, they took grievance with the fact that no representative from the NYSAC questioned Cormier over the baffling notion of him losing 1.2 pounds in a matter of minutes. Johnson's team then called for Cormier to address the issue under oath, and if his testimony does not provide a satisfactory explanation, for Cormier to be fined 20 percent of his fight purse and stripped of his UFC light heavyweight title for failing to make weight. Johnson has stated that he does not want Cormier to be stripped of his title but instead be fined 20%. On June 2, the NYSAC denied Johnson's appeal.

In addition, multiple other Hedgehog pathway inhibitors are in different phases of clinical trials.  Overview of the Hedgehog Signaling Pathway  The classical Hedgehog signaling pathway involves glycoproteins that are secreted by cells into the intercellular space. Multiple such glycoproteins have been characterized: Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), Indian Hedgehog (Ihh), and Desert Hedgehog (Dhh).Varjosalo M, Taipale J. Hedgehog: functions and mechanisms. Genes & development. 2008 Sep 15;22(18):2454-72. Among these, Shh is the most potent. It binds and inactivates the transmembrane protein Patched1 (PTCH1). In the absence of Shh, PTCH1 inhibits the activity of Smoothened (SMO), another transmembrane protein. Upon the inactivation of PTCH1 by Shh, glioma- associated (GLI) transcription factors enter the nucleus and activate the expression of multiple genes including Myc, Bcl-2, NANOG, and SOX2. Targets of GLIs include genes involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and self-renewal of stem cells.Hui CC, Angers S. Gli proteins in development and disease. Annual review of cell and developmental biology. 2011 Nov 10;27:513-37.Scales SJ, de Sauvage FJ. Mechanisms of Hedgehog pathway activation in cancer and implications for therapy. Trends in pharmacological sciences. 2009 Jun 1;30(6):303-12.Stecca B, Ruiz i Altaba A. Context-dependent regulation of the GLI code in cancer by HEDGEHOG and non-HEDGEHOG signals. Journal of molecular cell biology. 2010 Apr 1;2(2):84-95. In addition to the canonical pathway described above, some alternate pathways related to Shh signaling have also been reported. One example is the activation of SMO without the subsequent entry of GLI transcription factors into the nucleus. Another, better characterized pathway is the activation of GLIs independent of Shh or PTCH1 / SMO. This alternate mode of triggering the activity of GLIs is common in cancer cells. Oncogenes such as KRAS can activate the GLIs in the absence of Shh signaling.Rajurkar M, De Jesus-Monge WE, Driscoll DR, Appleman VA, Huang H, Cotton JL, Klimstra DS, Zhu LJ, Simin K, Xu L, McMahon AP. The activity of Gli transcription factors is essential for Kras-induced pancreatic tumorigenesis. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 2012 Apr 24;109(17):E1038-47. Transcriptional activity of GLIs is also upregulated upon the knockdown of p53, a tumor- suppressor gene often lost during cancer progression.Stecca B, i Altaba AR. A GLI1‚Äêp53 inhibitory loop controls neural stem cell and tumour cell numbers. The EMBO Journal. 2009 Mar 18;28(6):663-76.  Role of Hedgehog Signaling in Cancer  As mentioned above, targets of the Hedgehog signaling pathway include genes involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and self-renewal of stem cells. Dysregulation of all these cellular processes has been reported across cancer types. Abnormal control of these processes in cancer cells is often a consequence of dysregulated Shh signaling. The first major breakthrough in understanding the role of Shh signaling in cancer progression was the discovery that mutations in the PTCH1 gene, which codes for the PTCH1 protein, were responsible for Gorlin syndrome.Aszterbaum M, Rothman A, Fisher M, Xie J, Bonifas JM, Zhang X, Epstein Jr EH, Johnson RL, Scott MP.

Mutations in the PTCH1 gene can lead to the abnormal activation of GLI transcriptional activity which in turn promotes tumor development and progression.

The gain-of-function GLI1 transcription factor TGLI1 enhances expression of VEGF-C and TEM7 to promote glioblastoma angiogenesis. Oncotarget. 2015 Sep 8;6(26):22653. This can lead to the activation of GLI transcriptional activity in the cell over-secreting Shh (autocrine signaling) or in neighboring cells (paracrine signaling). Further, Shh ligands can stimulate the production of growth factors by stromal cells present in the tumor microenvironment. These growth factors, in turn, promote the growth, survival, and proliferation of cancer cells.Yauch RL, Gould SE, Scales SJ, Tang T, Tian H, Ahn CP, Marshall D, Fu L, Januario T, Kallop D, Nannini-Pepe M. A paracrine requirement for hedgehog signalling in cancer. Nature. 2008 Sep;455(7211):406. Aberrant Shh signaling has also been implicated in the maintenance of cancer stem cells (CSCs). In chronic myeloid leukemia and breast cancer, inhibition of Shh signaling has been shown to reduce stem cell propagation and renewal. In pancreatic and colorectal cancer, Shh signaling in CSCs drives epithelial-mesenchymal transition and, ultimately, cancer metastasis.Feldmann G, Dhara S, Fendrich V, Bedja D, Beaty R, Mullendore M, Karikari C, Alvarez H, Iacobuzio-Donahue C, Jimeno A, Gabrielson KL.

Prognostic significance of tumorigenic cells with mesenchymal features in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Journal of the National Cancer Institute. 2010 Mar 3;102(5):340-51. CSCs exhibit increased potential for self-renewal, differentiation, and for starting secondary tumors at distant organ sites. CSCs also exhibit mechanisms that drive resistance to chemotherapies and radiotherapy. As a result, while chemotherapy and radiotherapy are often successful in eliminating the bulk of the tumor (which consists of non-CSCs), CSCs that are left behind can lead to tumor recurrence.Prieto-Vila M, Takahashi RU, Usuba W, Kohama I, Ochiya T. Drug resistance driven by cancer stem cells and their niche. International journal of molecular sciences. 2017 Dec 1;18(12):2574.Phi LT, Sari IN, Yang YG, Lee SH, Jun N, Kim KS, Lee YK, Kwon HY. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) in drug resistance and their therapeutic implications in cancer treatment. Stem cells international. 2018;2018. Thus, via its role in CSC maintenance, Shh signaling contributes towards the failure of anti-cancer therapies.  Mechanism of Action of Hedgehog Pathway Inhibitors  Given the role of Shh signaling in promoting tumor progression and in the failure of anti-cancer therapies, the Hedgehog signaling pathway is an important therapeutic target for restricting tumor progression and to prevent disease recurrence post-treatment. Different parts of the Hedgehog signaling pathway may be targeted to abrogate the activation of pathways that promote tumor progression.  SMO Inhibitors  Inhibition of the transmembrane protein Smoothened (SMO) prevents the induction of GLI transcriptional activity upon exposure of cancer cells to Shh ligands. Loss of induction of GLIs upon activation of Shh signaling inhibits the ability of Shh signaling to promote tumor progression and cancer stem cell maintenance. Therefore, SMO has been a primary target in the development of Hedgehog pathway inhibitors. Two such inhibitors, Sonidegib and Vismodegib have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating basal cell carcinoma. Multiple other SMO inhibitors are in active clinical trials. = GDC-0449 (Vismodegib / Erivedge) = Vismodegib was created by Roche / Genentech / Curis. It directly binds to SMO, preventing GLI activation. In January 2012, it became the first Hedgehog pathway inhibitor to be approved by the FDA for the treatment of any cancer. Vismodegib is currently used for the treatment of metastatic basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in adults. It is also used for treating patients with locally advanced BCC who are not candidates for surgery or radiation therapy.Sekulic A, Migden MR, Oro AE, Dirix L, Lewis KD, Hainsworth JD, Solomon JA, Yoo S, Arron ST, Friedlander PA, Marmur E. Efficacy and safety of vismodegib in advanced basal-cell carcinoma. New England Journal of Medicine. 2012 Jun 7;366(23):2171-9. However, it has been shown that cancer cells in BCC patients can develop resistance to Vismodegib via mutations in the SMO protein which prevents the binding of the drug to SMO.Rudin CM, Hann CL, Laterra J, Yauch RL, Callahan CA, Fu L, Holcomb T, Stinson J, Gould SE, Coleman B, LoRusso PM.

The stadium is named after one of the holidays celebrated on July 25. It is currently used mostly for football matches. The stadium holds 1,00 people and its dimensions is 100 x 64 meters. It is operated by the Santiago North Regional Football Association (ARFSN). The stadium is home to Pedra Badejo's best clubs including Scorpion Vermelho, Benfica (one of three on the island, two are called Benfica, the other is in Praia) and Desportivo. All clubs participate in the Santiago Island League North Zone. The stadium is also used as a training ground by the three clubs before its matches. History The football (soccer) field started construction in 2006 and was finished in 2008 replacing the nearby dirt field. In 1999, football clubs from Santa Catarina and the middle of the island played in that stadium. When Est√°dio de Cumb√©m was constructed in 2008, all of its clubs based in S√£o Miguel plays at that stadium. Os Garridos played in the stadium until 2010, after that, clubs from S√£o Domingos switched to the South Zone including Garridos. The stadium was used for the Cape Verdean Football Championships in 2007, 2008 and 2010 with Scorpion Vermelho, 2010 with Benfica Santa Cruz and the last in 2013 with Scorpion Vermelho, from 2007, only the group stage matches took place at the stadium. In the 2014-15 regional season, it was the stadium where Tarrafal's Beira-Mar was crowned champion. In January 2017, construction began for a new stand with larger capacities, new changerooms and an artificial turf, it will be completed in July. On May 11, AJAC was punished by the regional association which meant Benfica de Santa Cruz would play three of its group stage matches at the stadium, a dispute has risen as Benfica Santa Cruz protested on an unknown problem of AJAC Calheta de S√£o Miguel. Led by some other clubs of the North Zone of the Premier Division, the FCF decided that AJAC became officially regional champions and became the recent club after Varandinha to win their first and only title. No national matches will be taken place at the stadium. Scorpion Vermelho won their fifth regional title and the stadium has three of the six matches currently being played for the 2018 National Division Panoramics The stadium can be viewed from most parts of Pedra Badejo.

He married a daughter of Comcomly, the most prominent Chinookan headman on the lower Columbia River. Fort Astoria In March 1811, the Pacific Fur Company vessel the Tonquin entered the Columbia River and established Fort Astoria. Founded by German-American merchant John Jacob Astor, the PFC was intended to create a string of fur trading stations along the Columbia and the interior eastwards towards the Rocky Mountains. Fort Astoria for much of its operations under the PFC was reliant upon various Chinookan headmen for substance. Diplomatic relationships with the Chinookan villages near the Columbia were critical for the viability of Fort Astoria. Scholars have affirmed that the American company and its \\"economic success depended on mutually beneficial economic exchanges with Indian groups... who controlled trade.\\" Many of the settlements near the station were under the influence of headman Comcomly. Assistance to fur traders Coalpo was an important mediator between the newly arrived fur traders and various Indigenous cultures near the Columbia River, serving in additional capacities as a guide and interpreter. Reports were circulated in April 1811 by Chinookans to Fort Astoria of a trade post maintained by white men in the interior. This was correctly conjectured by PFC employees to be their NWC rivals, later found to be Spokane House. Departing on 2 May, Alexander McKay led Robert Stuart, Gabriel Franch√®re, Ovide de Montigny and a number of voyageurs up the Columbia River to investigate these claims. The party passed Tongue Point and passed the night at Coalpo's village, \\"Wahkaykum.\\" On the 4th of May, de Montigny and Mackay explored the Cowlitz River with Coalpo. While on the river, they encountered a large canoe force of Cowlitz warriors. McKay was able to negotiate with the armed force and create amicable relations. Members of the Cowlitz leadership explained they were in the middle of strife with a Chinookan Skilloot village nearby. Continuing up the Columbia, the party met the prominent Multnomah Chinookan noble Kiesno. The Multonomah headman had married another daughter of Comcomly, making him a relative of Coalpo. Afterwards they passed the mouth of the Willamette River, an area described by the Clatsop as full of game and hide bearing animals. On 10 May, the party reached the rapids controlled by various Wasco and Wishram villages which included Celilo Falls. Coalpo would not go further than the borderlands of these people, informing McKay that the Wishram and Wascoes if allowed to would kill him. This was due to a prior military campaign he commanded that destroyed a major settlement in the area. In particular Alexander Henry the younger later called Coalpo an \\"inveterate enemy of the natives of the rapids\\". Content to see that the rumored NWC station wasn't at the important fishery, McKay led the party back to Fort Astoria and arrived on the 14 May. Near the end of June, Coalpo took David Stuart, four French-Canadians and four Hawaiian Kanakas from Astoria to Cape Disappointment. They sailed on the Columbia on a large canoe owned by Coalpo. While at Cape Disappointment, Stuart reviewed the general terrain and fur bearing animal populations.

It was released for Microsoft Windows on May 30, 2017, followed by the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions on June 6, and by the Nintendo Switch version on October 31. The story follows Cassie Thornton, a blind woman who perceives the world using echolocation. The player assumes the role of Cassie and must use her unique skill to explore a large mansion in Gloucester, Massachusetts and uncover its secrets. The development team behind Perception consists of several former Irrational Games employees that had worked on BioShock (2007) and BioShock Infinite (2013). Gameplay The ringing of a grandfather clock makes the environment visible due to Cassie's echolocation Perception is a first-person survival horror adventure video game in which the player assumes the role of Cassie Thornton, a blind woman who navigates a mansion through means of echolocation. This skill allows sounds such as Cassie's footsteps, dripping water, or flowing wind allow the player to catch a glimpse of their surroundings. Through use of echolocation, the player must explore the environment to examine objects and unravel the game's story. The player also has a cane which they can tap to provide a complete view of any given room. If the player taps too much, the game's antagonist haunting the establishment, known as the Presence, may kill them. The Presence cannot be killed directly, and has been compared to the enemies in other horror games such as Amnesia: The Dark Descent (2010), Outlast (2013) and Alien: Isolation (2014). Cassie also has a cell phone which the player can use to send pictures and text to an operator who can describe the content to them. Development Perception was developed by The Deep End Games, a Boston-based development studio founded by Bill Gardner. Gardner had previously worked for Irrational Games where he had worked on BioShock and BioShock Infinite. The studio consists of several other former Irrational Games employees that had also worked on the BioShock series, and also Gardner's wife serves as writer and producer. Development had been under way on Perception for around six months and was being self-funded by Gardner before the team launched a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign in May 2015 requesting US$150,000. The campaign concluded successfully a month later with $168,041 raised towards the game's remaining development. Perception is set in Gloucester, Massachusetts. Gardner explained that he drew from New England's reputation for being a reoccurring setting in horror fiction, such as in Lovecraft stories. He also described the architecture of the estate in the game to resemble that of architecture in the region. Release Perception was released for Microsoft Windows via Steam and GOG.com on May 30, 2017. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions followed on June 6, 2017. The game was published by Feardemic, an independent publisher in Krak√≥w, Poland. On October 31, 2017, the Nintendo Switch version was released; on the same date, the game received a \\"Remaster Update\\" that added new difficulty modes and script changes. Reception Perception received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. The game was nominated for \\"Most Fulfilling Community-Funded Game\\" at the 2018 SXSW Gaming Awards.

It is taken by mouth and is used in combination with low-dose cytarabine. The recommended dose of glasdegib is 100 mg orally once daily on days 1 to 28 in combination with cytarabine 20 mg subcutaneously twice daily on days 1 to 10 of each 28-day cycle in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or loss of disease control. The most common adverse reactions are anemia, fatigue, hemorrhage, febrile neutropenia, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, edema, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea, decreased appetite, dysgeusia, mucositis, constipation, and rash. It is a small molecule inhibitor of sonic hedgehog, which is a protein overexpressed in many types of cancer. It inhibits the sonic hedgehog receptor smoothened (SMO), as do most drugs in its class. History Glasdegib was approved for medical use in the United States in December 2018. FDA approval was based on a multicenter, open- label, randomized study (BRIGHT AML 1003, NCT01546038) that included 115 subjects with newly-diagnosed AML who met at least one of the following criteria: a) age 75 years or older, b) severe cardiac disease, c) baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2, or d) baseline serum creatinine >1.3 mg/dL. Subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive glasdegib, 100 mg daily, with LDAC 20 mg subcutaneously twice daily on days 1 to 10 of a 28-day cycle (N=77) or LDAC alone (N=38) in 28-day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The trial was conducted in United States, Canada and Europe. Efficacy was established based on an improvement in overall survival (date of randomization to death from any cause). With a median follow-up of 20 months, median survival was 8.3 months (95% CI: 4.4, 12.2) for the glasdegib + LDAC arm and 4.3 months (95% CI: 1.9, 5.7) for the LDAC alone arm and HR of 0.46 (95% CI: 0.30, 0.71; p=0.0002). Glasdegib was granted priority review and orphan drug designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It was granted orphan drug designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in October 2017. Glasdegib was approved for medical use in the European Union in June 2020.

Writing style and awards  Wiprud's thirteen novels are mysteries and thrillers. His novel, Pipsqueak, won Left Coast Crime's Lefty Award (Best Humorous Mystery). His novel, Crooked, was a finalist for the Shamus and Barry Awards. He was a self- published novelist until his novel Pipsqueak was nominated for the 2004 Barry Award for best original paperback original, and won that year's Lefty Award, given for the funniest crime novel. At that point, he was approached by an agent and given a contract by Random House for Pipsqueak and four additional Garth Carson novels. In 2009, he was contracted by St. Martins Press for three books - the novel Feelers was optioned for film. In 2013, he authored The Clause for Midnight Ink. He has been a member of Mystery Writers of America for over fifteen years. Since 2017, Wiprud has launched the Boone Linsenbigler thriller series about a liquor brand pitchman promoted by his employer as an adventuring hero. Drawn into dangerous situations at fishing lodges in exotic locations, Boone manages to live up to his false reputation, cocktail in one hand, the latest flame in the other, characterized in a review as 'an accidental James Bond.' This series also includes the non-fiction book Linsenbigler Cocktail Companion, a genuine guide to simplifying the making of cocktails and 'authored by Boone' (and assisted by Wiprud). Late in 2019, another non-fiction title by Boone/Wiprud will be Linsenbigler Angler's Companion, a treatise on Boone's angling methods and observations on the sport.

Pictured here are wind turbines in Darling, Cape Province. Renewable energy in South Africa is energy generated in South Africa from renewable resources, those that naturally replenish themselves‚Äîsuch as sunlight, wind, tides, waves, rain, biomass, and geothermal heat. Renewable energy focuses on four core areas: electricity generation, air and water heating/cooling, transportation, and rural energy services. The energy sector in South Africa is an important component of global energy regimes due to the country's innovation and advances in renewable energy. South Africa's contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is ranked as moderate and its per capita emission rate is higher than the global average. Energy demand within the country is expected to rise steadily and double by 2025. Of all South African renewable energy sources, solar holds the most potential. Because of the country's geographic location, it receives large amounts of solar energy. Wind energy is also a major potential source of renewable energy. Due to the high wind velocity on the coast of the country, Cape Town has implemented multiple wind farms, which generate significant amounts of energy. Renewable energy systems in the long-term are comparable or cost slightly less than non-renewable sources. Biomass is currently the largest renewable energy contributor in South Africa with 9-14% of the total energy mix. Renewable energy systems are costly to implement in the beginning but provide high economic returns in the long-run. The two main barriers accompanying renewable energy in South Africa are: the energy innovation system, and the high cost of renewable energy technologies. The Renewable Energy Independent Power Producers Procurement Programme (REI4P) suggests that the cost associated with renewable energy will equal the cost of non-renewable energy by 2030. Renewable energy is becoming more efficient, inexpensive, and widely used. South Africa has an abundance of renewable resources that can effectively supply the country's energy.  Policies & regulations  South Africa is a member of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), an international organization that promotes renewable energy policies. The IRENA helps with tools to create policies and the transition of technology necessary for renewable energy. It provides an assessment of resources, finance management, policy and legal framework, and the capacity of the energy sector.  Renewable Energy Feed-In Tariff (2009-2011)  The National Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA) implemented the Renewable Energy Feed-In Tariff (REFIT) in 2009. The REFIT works to progressively reduce carbon-based power generation by moving in the direction of renewable energy sources. NERSA employed the REFIT in an attempt to meet the target of producing 10TWh of electricity by 2013. When first introduced, the feed-in tariffs applied only to wind energy, hydropower, and concentrated solar power (CSP). Six months after the introduction, the tariffs were expanded to include biomass and solar photovoltaics. The organization wants to achieve sustainability through the use of renewable resources while engaging stakeholders, lowering the cost of investment, and making the cost of electricity more affordable for all. The decentralized investment opportunity provides South Africa with the resources to overcome its current energy crisis. REFIT is the first successful greenhouse gas mitigating projects used in South Africa. The REFIT program was superseded by the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producers Procurement Programme in May 2011.  Renewable Energy Independent Power Producers Procurement Programme (Since 2011)  South Africa first introduced the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producers Procurement Programme (REI4P) in 2011. The program includes an initiative to install 17.8GW of renewable energy in South Africa before 2030. The goal of the REI4P is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while minimizing the country's reliance on non-renewable energy sources such as nuclear and coal. REI4P also works to promote local manufacturing of materials used in the renewable energy sector.  Tax Incentive (Since 2016)  To incentivize the further rollout of renewable energy generation by the private sector, the South African Revenue Service has of 1 January 2016 amended the Income Tax Act No. 58 of 1962 to include accelerated depreciation for renewable energy assets commissioned by a tax paying entity. This tax incentive is not limited to new renewable generation systems. = Photovoltaic Solar Energy Generation = Government plans make a special provision for photovoltaic systems that are smaller or equal to 1 MWp (Megawatt peak) in section 12 B of the Tax Act. Owners can depreciate the investment 100% in the first year. Depreciating the photovoltaic solar system 100% in the first year grants the taxpayer a tax shield due to saved income tax. This provides, in effect, a 28% discount on the photovoltaic solar system. The tax shield applies even if the photovoltaic solar system is installed mid-year. By partially financing the photovoltaic solar system through debt, systems can achieve a repayment time of 1 year. Systems subsequently achieve ongoing electricity savings for each year of operation. = Other Renewable Energy Generation = Wind power, concentrated solar power (CSP), biomass, photovoltaic systems exceeding 1 MWp, hydropower not exceeding 30 MW as well as biomass systems are also incentivized through an accelerated depreciation with the following schedule: * Year 1: 50% depreciation * Year 2: 30% depreciation * Year 3: 20% depreciation  Types of energy  South Africa receives large amounts of solar radiation each year.  Solar energy  Solar energy is light and heat that is radiated from the Sun. It is then transformed into electricity through photovoltaics (PV) or concentrated solar power (CSP). Solar energy in South Africa is primarily based in PV and CSP. The levelized cost of solar electricity is relative to the quality and quantity of solar radiation in South Africa. The same plant can produce up to 20% more electricity for the same capital investment in South Africa compared to countries in Europe. The furthest area in the west of the country receives the highest levels of solar radiation, ranging from 2100 kWh/m2 to more than 2300 kWh/m2. Solar power production in South Africa is supposed to reach 8400 MW by the year 2030. South Africa implemented a solar park in the Northern Cape region that is set to deliver 180,000 megawatts of annual solar energy to the country. It is estimated that only 3000 km^2 of land used for solar electricity is required to meet South Africa's demand. Solar energy is a low-cost source of energy compared to traditional non- renewable energy resources in South Africa. The introduction of solar power plants has stimulated the economy and created jobs within the country. South Africa's land cover receives an average of 2,500 hours of sunshine per year. Solar energy systems have a high initial cost, but typically return the investment within 5 to 8 years. The use of solar energy in South Africa is driving the use of other renewable energy sources including wind, hydroelectric, and biomass. Jeffrey's Bay Wind Farm is located on the Eastern cape and has a production output of 100MW. It is the second largest wind farm in South Africa.  Wind energy  Wind power uses wind turbines to produce electric power. Wind levels vary depending on factors such as terrain, bodies of water and vegetative cover. Wind turbines convert the wind into kinetic energy and mechanical power. The wind turns 50-metre-long blades attached to 80 metre-high shafts that generate the electric energy. Wind turbine farms can range between 10MW to over 100 MW and produce energy when the wind is between 13‚Äì90 km/h. Wind turbines farms can be onshore or offshore. Offshore have stronger winds and less visual impact. In 2014 the first major wind farm became operational with approximately 10 either operational or in construction today. South Africa's extensive coastline and geographical terrain including lowlands and high veld escarpment, provide wind energy that can be extracted and generated into off-the-shelf technology. There are currently 19 wind energy developments in South Africa with more than 600 wind turbines. On the international scale, South Africa ranks as having fair to reasonable wind resources. Wind power is a renewable, widely distributed and clean form of energy. The production of wind energy does not produce greenhouse gases and is an alternative to burning fossil fuels. Gariep Dam, located in Eastern Cape, is a large-scale hydroelectric site with the primary purposes of power generation, irrigation, domestic and industrial use.  Hydropower  Hydropower, or hydroelectric power, is energy that is captured from flowing water and turned into electricity. The most common forms of hydropower use hydroelectric dams to create a reservoir. Water released from the reservoir flows through a turbine that generates electricity. South Africa currently has seven hydroelectric power stations across the country, all owned by Eskom. The country's hydroelectricity potential is limited due to the low annual rainfall rate of 500mm. South Africa experiences seasonal flows and frequent droughts, which pose obstacles to the hydropower success. The Eastern Cape province the most hydro-potential in the country. Hydroelectric dams in South Africa can be associated with other water uses, such as irrigation and flood control, to increase economic development within the country. The current installed capacity within the country is 668MW. Large-scale (>10MW) hydroelectric generation systems have the potential to contribute up to 5091MW of energy, but can have negative implications on the environment. The large amount of flowing water can damage river ecology, and the facilities take up a significant amount of land space. Small-scale (<10MW) hydroelectric generation systems can contribute up to 69MW of energy and do not have any major environmental implications. Biomass is the largest renewable energy contributor in South Africa, holding 9-14% of the energy mix.  Biomass  Biomass is physical biological material that comes from living or recently living organisms. It comes from plants or materials derived from plants (lignocellulosic biomass). Biomass has the capacity to produce electricity, heat, or liquid fuels. Biomass can be used as an direct energy source as heating or cooking fuel, or cab be burned to generate electricity. It can also be used indirectly by using its biological processes and producing ethanol, methanol, and fuel that can be used to transportation and cooking processes. Wood is currently the largest producer of biomass fuel‚Äîincluding tree stumps, forest residue, dead trees, and wood chips. Animal matter and plant matter can also be converted into forms of biofuel. South Africa currently has several biodiesel production facilities in production. South Africa's 42 million hectares of natural woodlands and 1.35 million hectares of plantation provide a large potential for biomass production. The South African government has a Working for Energy Programme that aims to process biomass energy for various applications. Geothermal energy is produced by extracting heat from the Earth's crust and converting it to electricity.  Geothermal energy  Geothermal energy is generated from heat that is stored in the Earth. The geothermal energy is that is generated from the Earth's crust is the original formation of the planet and from radioactive decay of material. Geothermal heat pumps tap into the ground to use this resource as a source of energy. The production of geothermal energy is a clean and sustainable form of energy. There are currently no geothermal energy practices in South Africa but there are projects underway to implement them. Geothermal measurements have been made throughout South Africa, demonstrating that there is high geothermal potential and that the relevant temperatures rank from medium to high on the global scale.  Energy providers  The South African energy sector is dominated by the company Eskom. Eskom currently produces 95% of South Africa's electricity. Due to their large presence in the non-renewable energy sector, there are independent power producers (IPP) who are capable of providing renewable energy sources. To reach the 10,000 GWh renewable energy target, the government has joined agencies and implemented policies that promote independent renewable energy producers. BioTherm Energy is the leading IPP because of their three wind and solar projects that are involved in REI4P. Mulilo is a South African company who provides clean energy such as wind and solar to the national grid. Mulilo is a member of the South African REI4P and has won 420MW worth of projects. They currently have 30MW of solar PV operational and have another 185MW scheduled. By the end of 2017, Mulilo was to contribute 240 megawatts of wind power. juwi South Africa is a renewable energy company who is also one of the world's leading renewable energy companies. juwi South Africa's main focus is on the production of solar energy on a utility and commercial scale, as well as onshore wind energy. juwi South Africa has built five utility-scale solar plants under the REI4P and they are also a member of the IPPs.  Future research  South Africa is one of the most popular countries for investment in renewable energy. In 2014, the country received US$5.5 billion towards renewable energy projects. Renewable energy in South Africa has the potential to increase access to electricity in rural areas because of its suitability for off-grid and small-scale solutions. The barriers of renewable energy in the country include lack of political stability and capacity, marginalization, corruption, poverty, and environmental degradation. The government introduces both short-to-medium and long-term targets to help set the pace of renewable energy production. A financial barrier exists in the renewable energy sector in South Africa. Investors choose to invest in large-scale non-renewable resource companies, such as Eskom, rather than Independent Power Producers such as BioTherm, Mulilo, and juwi South Africa. The high initial capital required to employ renewable energy is a large constraint the sector experiences.

It dates from the late nineteenth century, and was bred specifically for cock-fighting. It named for its area of origin, that of the city of Li√®ge in Wallonia, in eastern central Belgium. It is one of three Belgian breeds of fighting-cock, the others being the Brugse Vechter and the Tiense Vechter. History The Luikse Vechter derives from the oldest of the three Belgian fighting-cock breeds, the Brugse Vechter, which originated in western Flanders in the early years of the nineteenth century and was formerly common throughout Belgium. In the later part of that century, in the area of Li√®ge, in Wallonia in eastern central Belgium, efforts were made to improve the fighting capabilities of the Brugse Vechter by cross-breeding with fighting birds of Oriental origin. The other Belgian fighting breed, the Tiense Vechter from the area of Tienen in Flemish Brabant, was created in much the same way. The Luikse Vechter is endangered in Belgium, but is the least threatened of the three Belgian gamecock breeds. In 2010 there were 285 birds, about equally distributed in Flanders and in Wallonia. A few are reared in Germany. A bantam Luikse Vechter was bred in the second part of the twentieth century. The plumage colours are superior to those of the full-sized breed. Although it is the most popular of the three bantam fighting breeds in Belgium, it is endangered. Some are reared in Germany and in the Netherlands. Characteristics The Luikse Vechter is a large and powerful bird. The face is deeply pigmented, and may vary from purplish-red to almost black. The comb should in theory be triple like that of the Brugse Vechter; it was often single and also large, but ‚Äì since 2000 ‚Äì single combs are longer allowed. The wattles are rudimentary or completely absent. The legs are thick and strong, and are slate-blue. The same seventeen plumage colours are recognised as for the Brugse Vechter. The most significant difference from the Brugse Vechter is in the line of the back, which in the Luikse Vechter is steeply angled, but in the Brugse Vechter is approximately horizontal. Use The Luikse Vechter was bred for its fighting ability. Cock-fighting is against the law in Belgium, and practitioners of the sport usually travel to northern France. Some strains are reared only for exhibition at poultry shows. References Further reading * J.-M. Larivi√®re, J. Detilleux, P. Leroy (2011).

From 2 October 1628, he had the right to lecture at universities. He then studied theology, but turned to medical and physical studies, encouraged by and . He studied with Daniel Sennert, and took part in the dispute with with the treatise physico-medicum de morbis totius substantiae & cognatis materiis pro Sennerto contra Freitagium. Sperling was appointed professor of physics on 2 February 1634. He served as a deacon of the faculty of philosophy four times, and was twice Rektor of the university. When he died, he was buried in the Schlosskirche on 15 August 1658. Sperling's major work was the zoological book Zoologia physica which was published in 1661 after his death by . Sperling was among the first to use the term zoology and treat it as a natural science. His book deals first with general aspects common to animals, then with the different classes and species. He has been called an \\"early modern zoologist\\".

The first, Thomas Guillard, is a jaded longtime expat who arrives in Ningyuan looking for a job at the local high school just as his visa is about to expire. The second, an idealistic young man named Daniel, who has been working in town since graduating from college, welcomes him initially, but then gradually comes to resent him over the course of the academic year, regarding him as the epitome of the pathetic, creepy laowai stereotype he has‚Äîuntil that point‚Äîtried his best to avoid. One of Daniel's former students, Bella, a young girl obsessed with learning English, befriends Guillard upon his arrival and provides numerous opportunities throughout the semester, both on- and off-campus, for the two characters to come together. In the end, however, the town and country prove to be too small for both of them. The novel was published on November 10, 2015, by Inkshares. Much of the book is based on Carroll's own experiences living abroad. In 2017, a second edition was released by Camphor Press.https://camphorpress.com/books/up-to-the- mountains-and-down-to-the-countryside  Plot  The story opens with Thomas Guillard, a cynical, booze-soaked Midwesterner, trying to buy a ticket to the town of Ningyuan at a crowded bus station in Changsha. Unable to do so, he falls into resentment and self-pity, until he is approached by Bella, a student from Ningyuan, who speaks excellent English and helps him secure a seat on her bus. Upon arriving in Ningyuan, Guillard learns that, since the semester has already started, class rosters have already been set, and the school administration is unwilling to reschedule them. Fortunately, Daniel, one of the overworked foreigners at the school, intercedes and arranges an informal interview with the principal over dinner, which results in Guillard being hired. While Guillard views Ningyuan as a dirty, uncivilized backwater, Daniel idealizes it for its beauty and authenticity. He tries his hardest to ingratiate himself with the locals by learning Mandarin, eating in their homes and performing songs on his guitar. As he becomes more familiar with Guillard, however, he begins to condemn him as being one of those middle-aged, white males who come to Asia to teach for lack of a better alternative. Guillard, for his part, sees Daniel as callow, aimless and hypocritical. These frustrations come to a boil during a Spring Festival dinner at Bella's grandparents' home and leave Daniel to question his idealistic outlook as well as his own qualifications for teaching abroad.  Reception  In a review titled \\"The Great American (in China) Novel\\" posted on the Los Angeles Review of Books China Blog, the novel was said to be \\"probably as close to [the China equivalent to The Sun Also Rises] as we're likely to get, or want\\" and dubbed \\"a fictionalized version of Peter Hessler's Peace Corps memoir River Town.\\" The blog Lost Laowai gave the book a 5-star rating, calling it an \\"exceptionally well-written piece of fiction, particularly for a debut novel\\" as well as \\"a joyful read.\\" Up to the Mountains and Down to the Countryside won the Silver Medal for Contemporary Fiction at the 2016 Independent Publisher Book Awards and was selected as a Kirkus Reviews Indie Book of the Month for January 2016.https://www.forewordreviews.com/trade-show- catalog/books/up-to-the-mountains-and-down-to-the-countryside The website Medium also selected an excerpt from the opening chapter as the winner of its 2012 Fiction Writing Contest.

After graduating from gymnasium in 1912, he went to study at Uppsala University, where he earned a Licentiate's degree in art history in 1919. Afterwards, he worked as an art critic for the newspapers Stockholms-Tidningen 1920‚Äì26, Stockholms Dagblad 1926‚Äì27 and as a literary critic for Social-Demokraten 1930‚Äì39.

Politically, Blomberg was influenced by marxism. According to him, one of the central tasks of the writer was to depict the realities of working people and the social and political contradictions in society. As a literary critic, Blomberg praised writers of the proletarian school, such as Jan Frideg√•rd, Ivar Lo-Johansson and Vilhelm Moberg. At the same time, he was critical of literary modernism. His poem Gravskrift ('Epitaph') was written after the √Ödalen shootings in 1931, when five people were killed after the military opened fire against a demonstration of striking workers.

Official enquiries into the crash began on 20 January and the cockpit voice recorder was recovered. Also killed were four other people on board, including the pilot, and , a partner in BTG Pactual, whose president, Andr√© Esteves, had been arrested in the Operation Car Wash investigation. More than two hundred politicians and business people were possibly implicated in a graft scheme that Zavascki was investigating.  Final Investigation Results  On 22.01.2018, the Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center (Centro de Investiga√ß√£o e Preven√ß√£o de Acidentes Aeron√°uticos, CENIPA) presented their final report. The conclusion was that there was no shortage of kerosene. Apparently the accident was caused by three major factors: * Bad visual climate conditions. At the time of the accident the horizontal visibility was 1500 meters and the rainfall was 25 mm/h. * Cultural practices of the pilots: the investigations found that several pilots who fly in this region rely heavily on their experience and don't follow strict security procedures, including informal practices which inhibit an adequate analysis of the risks involved in this specific landing procedure. * Spatial disorientation: as a consequence of the bad visibility, the flight curve executed, the low level above the sea and the stress of the pilot, he probably lost control of the plane.

Based in Shanghai between 1998 and 2011, his photographic monograph Phantom Shanghai (2007), looks at the rapid and at times violent transition of Shanghai as the city raced to make itself \\"modern again\\" at the beginning of the 21st Century. Other recent titles include Hanoi Calling (2010), and In the Near Distance (2010), a book of early photographs made in Asia and North America between 1973 and 1986. He is currently working on a book that examines the social and physical landscape of US military bases in Asia and their host communities. Girard's work is in the collection of the National Gallery of Canada, The Art Gallery of Ontario, the Vancouver Art Gallery. His photographs have appeared in Time, Newsweek, Fortune, Forbes, Elle, Paris Match, Stern, The New York Times Magazine. His work has been exhibited in galleries in South Korea, London, Germany, Helsinki, and New York City. In addition to book projects and gallery work he is a contributing photographer to National Geographic. Biography Girard‚Äôs first photographs were made in the city he grew up, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, in the early 1970s. Between 1972 and 1982, Girard had an early interest in the effects of artificial light on colour film at night, and subject matter dealing with the social and physical underside of the city. During this period he also made his first trips to Asia, to Hong Kong and South-East Asia, later living in Tokyo in the late 1970s. This early interest in Asia resulted in relocating to Hong Kong in 1982, where he lived until 1998. A move to Shanghai followed, where he lived for more than a decade, before returning in 2011 to Vancouver, where he lives today. Notable work Under Vancouver 1972-1982 Under Vancouver 1972-1982 is a collection of photographs of Girard's hometown, Vancouver (and published as a book of the same title), a series that began while he was still in high school. In this early work the city's origins as a west coast Canadian port at the end of the rail line are still much in evidence. Soon after this work was made, Vancouver began to be noticed by the wider world (after Expo 86), and the city began refashioning itself as an urban resort close to nature, also attracting attention as a destination for real estate investment. The photographs in Under Vancouver 1972‚Äì1982 reveal an early interest in the hidden and the overlooked, the use of color transparency film at night, and the extended photographic inquiry of a specific place, all of which became signature features of later books such as City of Darkness and City of Darkness Revisited (about the Kowloon Walled City), Phantom Shanghai and Hanoi Calling. Kowloon Walled City Photographed between 1986 and 1992, Girard's Kowloon Walled City photographs form the basis for the books City of Darkness: Life in Kowloon Walled City and City of Darkness Revisited, a record of the final years of the infamous Kowloon Walled City in Hong Kong: a largely self-governing enclave of more than 35,000 people living in 300 interconnected high-rise buildings, constructed without architectural, engineering or health and safety oversight. While it stood (until 1992) Kowloon Walled City was the most densely populated place on Earth. Girard‚Äôs photographs, along with co- author Ian Lambot‚Äôs, provide the most thorough record of what life was like for Walled City residents, and have served as a visual reference for film production designers (e.g. Batman Begins directed by Christopher Nolan), writers (e.g. The Bridge Trilogy by William Gibson), video game designers (e.g. Call of Duty: Black Ops) and others in creating an imagined dystopian urban environment. Phantom Shanghai Photographed between 2000 and 2006, Phantom Shanghai defines a key historic moment as China‚Äôs largest city was racing to make up for \\"lost time\\" (following China‚Äôs isolation after Mao Zedong‚Äôs victory in 1949 and the tumult of the Cultural Revolution, 1966-1976). The destruction of architecturally and historically significant buildings and neighborhoods is a significant feature of this series by Girard. Phantom Shanghai is featured in Martin Parr and WasinkLundgren‚Äôs The Chinese Photobook. Hanoi Calling Photographed by Girard in 2009 and 2010, Hanoi Calling was published in 2010 to commemorate the millennium anniversary of the founding of the Vietnamese capital. Looking at the often ignored and overlooked features of the everyday city, Hanoi Calling is a record of the public and private spaces that form the foreground and background to daily life as the millennium anniversary approached. In the Near Distance In the Near Distance, published in 2010, looks at Girard‚Äôs early work between 1972 and 1986, in his home town Vancouver and on travels to the US, Japan, and other parts of Asia. The early use of colour transparency film and long exposures at night, which became a signature feature of his later work, especially in Phantom Shanghai, are first in evidence here. Hotel Okinawa Japan‚Äôs southernmost prefecture, Okinawa, hosts a concentration of US military bases unlike anywhere outside the continental United States. More than half the 50,000 US troops stationed in Japan are based here. On the main island of Okinawa nearly 20% of the land is occupied by these bases. This large US military footprint, and the legacy of Okinawa‚Äôs history as a US- administered territory until 1972, means that the social and physical landscape of Okinawa is shaped by this relationship with the US military like few other places. In Hotel Okinawa (2017), Girard looks at this unique world \\"on base\\" and off, separate and yet conjoined, the result of decades of living in close proximity with the US military. Additionally, archival photographs, periodicals and other artefacts, some dating back to the US occupation, appear throughout the book, registering historical strands that are part of the complex fabric of Okinawa today.

It protects a mountainous area of cerrado vegetation that is home to various endemic, rare or endangered species. Trails provide environmental interpretation, and lead to lookouts that give panoramic views, to rivers and waterfalls, and to archaeological sites with rock paintings. Location The Rio Preto State Park is in the municipality of S√£o Gon√ßalo do Rio Preto, Minas Gerais, from Diamantina. It has an area of . It is from Belo Horizonte, the state capital. A section of a colonial-era Estrada Real (Royal Road) passed through the park, and traces still remain. This was a route used by gold and diamond prospectors. The park covers part of the Espinha√ßo Mountains. It has a rugged relief with quartz rocks that form beautiful cliffs. The park holds several springs, notably that of the Rio Preto, one of the main tributaries of the Ara√ßua√≠ River, which in turn is a tributary of the Jequitinhonha River. The abundant watercourses form waterfalls, natural pools, rapids, sinkholes, canyons and fluvial beaches with white sands. History The Rio Preto was declared a \\"permanently protected river\\" in 1991 in response to demand from the local community. The Rio Preto State Park was created by decree 35.611 of 1 June 1994, with an area of . It was opened to visitors in 2002. Decree 44.175 of 20 December 2005 enlarged the area of the park. The park became part of the Espinha√ßo Mosaic of conservation units, created in 2010. In April 2013, the Public Ministry and Justice department of Minas Gerais charged that the State Forestry Institute had been failing to comply with environmental legislation. There were serious problems such as lack of a management plan, physical structures and personnel, and land tenure issues with the ecological stations of Mata do Acau√£ and Mata dos Ausentes and the state parks of Biribiri, Alto Cariri, Rio Preto and Serra Negra. Environment The park includes lands that used to be the Boleiras, Alecrim and Curral farms. Former activities included animal husbandry, capture of live animals and collection of wild fruits. Average annual precipitation is , with more than 90% falling between October and March. Average annual temperatures ranges from , with cooler temperatures in the dry season. Vegetation is characteristic of the cerrado, including leaning, twisted trees with irregular, distorted branches from high. Lower trees are found at altitudes above and between rock outcrops. Semi-deciduous trees are found in the stream valleys. The eastern part of the park has flora found in the Atlantic Forest. The park's vegetation in mostly cerrado and alpine tundra. Flora include monjolo, pau pereira, candeia, sucupira, pau d'√≥leo, peroba, ip√™, araticum, carvalho and various species of evergreens. Endemic birds include the hyacinth visorbearer (Augastes scutatus), Cipo canastero (Asthenes luizae) and serra finch (Embernagra longicauda). The burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia), masked water tyrant (Fluvicola nengeta) and grassland sparrow (Ammodramus humeralis) are also found. Mammals include endangered species such as the maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), giant armadillo (Priodontes maximus) and ocelot (Leopardus pardalis). Other mammals include cougar (Puma concolor) and deer. There are native species of fish, including the jundi√°, discovered in Rio Preto and still poorly researched. Visiting Beach on the Rio Preto The park is open from 07:00 to 17:00 from Tuesday to Sunday. The park has a well-equipped visitor center with an auditorium for 70 people, meeting rooms and an exhibition hall. There is parking and a restaurant, twelve lodges that can accommodate 52 people, a camping area with room for 25 tents, kiosks, grills and changing rooms. Lodgings and camp spaces must be reserved in advance. Attractions include the Crioulo and Sempre Viva waterfalls, rock paintings and natural lookouts.

It dates from the late nineteenth century, and was bred specifically for cock- fighting. It named for its area of origin, that around the city of Tienen in Flemish Brabant, in eastern central Belgium. It is one of three Belgian breeds of fighting-cock, the others being the Brugse Vechter and the Luikse Vechter. History The Tiense Vechter derives from the oldest of the three Belgian fighting-cock breeds, the Brugse Vechter, which originated in western Flanders in the early years of the nineteenth century and was formerly common throughout Belgium. In the later part of that century, in the area of Li√®ge, in Wallonia in eastern central Belgium, efforts were made to improve the fighting capabilities of the Brugse Vechter by cross-breeding with fighting birds of Oriental origin, which gave rise to the Luikse Vechter. The Tiense Vechter was created in much the same way, in the provinces of Brabant, Li√®ge and Limburg, and mainly in the area of Tienen in Flemish Brabant. It was reared particularly in the villages of , Glabbeek, , Oplinter and Vissenaken. The Tiense Vechter is critically endangered. It is the most threatened of the three Belgian gamecock breeds. In 2010 there were 33 birds, all in Flanders. A bantam Tiense Vechter was bred in the second part of the twentieth century. The plumage colours are superior to those of the full-sized breed. Like the full-sized bird, it is critically endangered. Characteristics The Tiense Vechter is a large and powerful bird. Like the Luikse Vechter and unlike the Brugse Vechter, it has a steeply inclined back-line. Unlike both the other fighting breeds, it has no dark pigmentation of the face, skin and legs, which are all pale. The comb is triple, and the wattles are rudimentary or completely absent. In addition to the seventeen plumage colours recognised for the Brugse Vechter, there are four others, including cuckoo, which is the pattern most commonly seen. Use The Tiense Vechter was bred for its fighting ability. Cock-fighting is against the law in Belgium, and practitioners of the sport usually travel to northern France. Some strains are reared only for exhibition at poultry shows. References Further reading * J.-M. Larivi√®re, J. Detilleux, P. Leroy (2011).

It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance. The name (\\"Witch tower\\") refers to it being used as a prison for suspected witches in the 17th century. Today it houses the Cantonal Archives of Obwalden. History The tower was built around 1285/86 (determined by Dendrochronological dating) as the residence tower of larger castle complex, the Unteren Burg von Sarnen or Lower Sarnen Castle. The castle was built for the von Kellner family who were knights in service to the Murbach Abbey. The first member of the family to appear in records is the cellarius Heinrich at the monastery in 1229. The family name may be a form of the title and office that he held. The sons of Heinrich and his brothers were the knights Niklaus and Heinrich Kellner who built the castle. Niklaus probably lived in Sarnen, while his brother lived in Lucerne. In 1291 the Habsburgs bought the town of Lucerne and the Unterwalden estates, including the castle and surrounding farms, from Murbach Abbey. The Kellner family became vassals of the Habsburg- Laufenburg line. When the Everlasting League was created on 1 August 1291, the Kellners found themselves at odds with their neighbors and by 1308 they had been driven out. The last Kellner, Heinrich, died in 1348. After the Kellners were forced out, the Landenburg family occupied the castle. The 15th century White Book of Sarnen contains a story about how in the early 14th century local Swiss patriots stormed a castle and burned it on Christmas Eve while the pro-Habsburg nobleman was attending Mass. Traditionally it was believed that the attack happened to nearby Landenberg Castle, though more recent research indicates that it may have been the Hexenturm. By the 15th century, the tower was a prison for the Canton of Obwalden. In the 16th century it was repaired and occasionally used to store powder and records. During the 17th century witch-hunts the tower was used to hold accused witches, leading to the name. At some time before 1798 the prison cell at the top of the tower was demolished. The fortifications around the tower gradually fell into disrepair and in the 19th century were demolished and replaced with terraces. In 1877 it was supposed to become a museum. A new entrance was built and some of the old windows were bricked up, but the museum never opened. Today the cantonal archives are stored in the tower.

His research in collaborative health is highly recognized and implemented; specially in the Swedish welfare sector.  Career  H√•kan Sandberg has undergraduate University studies in literature, Nordic language, psychology, philosophy and education from the Swedish universities in Uppsala, Link√∂ping, √ñrebro and Malm√∂. He completed his PhD in education at Uppsala University 1995. Following his first focus of research, teamwork in Child and youth psychiatry, he moved on to make team research and educational research as a senior fellow at M√§lardalen University where he became an Associate Professor in Education in 2004. He is also a well known author of textbooks in the area of teamwork as well as pedagogics. H√•kan Sandberg has been speaker at national and international conferences and have been guest researcher at Stirling university.  Collaborative Health  The concept of collaborative health was developed in connection with team research by the H√•kan Sandberg, for the first time in a research report in Swedish 2004. Working life research had at the end of the 20th century made clear that working life conditions in the welfare sector affect peoples‚Äô health (cf. concepts like psycho ‚Äì social conditions, mobbing, burnout, fatigue etc.). Following his PhD thesis regarding teamwork in childcare and youth psychiatry, Sandberg expanded his team research to the entire welfare sector. In this work, finding that teamwork consequences are not only about productivity and efficiency, but also about the wellbeing of the team members, Sandberg combines collaboration and wellbeing in teamwork in terms of collaborative health thereby focusing the ‚Äúteamwork trend‚Äù with its emphasis on intensive collaboration. Curious about the concept‚Äôs position in an international context, Sandberg decided to publish articles about collaborative health in English, which in this context also was found to be an innovation (2010, 2013). In his overview of his own research and how the concept of collaborative health was found to be a relevant description of the individual‚Äôs wellbeing and health in the intensive collaboration of teamwork, Sandberg defines collaborative health as : The physical, psychological and social health resources the individual uses in teamwork and, at the same time, health resources which are influenced by teamwork. Sandberg also concludes that collaborative health has a role to play in highlighting the new collaborative demands in the service sector and creates space for a new perspective in research based on this knowledge. Sandberg has also published works in education, communication, health and social services. He recently also made a transition from being a university professors to dedicating more time in private research and consultations and publishing more of his ideas in both Swedish and English. Collaborative health has recently (2017) began to be spread as a tool in developmental projects concerning collaboration between authorities in the welfare sector in Sweden.

The San-Francisco-based commune was founded in 1967 on principles of a common treasury, group marriage, free art, gay liberation, and selfless service. They were originally called the Sutter/Scott Street commune, and commonly referred to by non-members as the Kaliflower commune after their newsletter of the same name. Because of their publishing activities, which allowed them to spread their philosophy, they became a significant influence on Bay Area culture. Many members of The Angels of Light, a free psychedelic drag theater group, originally lived in the Kaliflower commune.Kaliflower, vol. I, no. 38, Jan. 8, 1970 The name Kaliflower came from their publication of the same name, titled after the Hindu name for the last and most violent age of humankind, the Kali Yuga.  Background  Communes played an integral part of the 1960s American hippie movement. Members of the 1960s counterculture movement created new social institutions in the form of Utopian communes like Kaliflower as a way to exist outside of the hegemonic system and to resist enforced heterosexuality, the Vietnam War, capitalism, racism, mass media, and the government. The Kaliflower community was founded on the same spiritual and economic principles as the Diggers: shared property and labor and the liberation of culture from commercialism. The commune's members were inspired by John Humphrey Noyes, founder of the Oneida Community, a perfectionist religious communal society that existed in New York in the 1840s, and his book, The History of American Socialisms. Cofounder Irving Rosenthal created the Free Print Shop, a print shop in the basement of Kaliflower, as a platform for uncensored, radical, free publishing in the Bay Area.  Founder  Irving Rosenthal is a writer and editor from San Francisco. He studied at the University of Chicago in the late 1950s where he was an editor of the Chicago Review. There he published many Beat writers including Jack Kerouac, Edward Dahlberg, and William Burroughs but he left the Chicago Review in 1959 after the University attempted to censor an issue of the Review. With the disputed material he cofounded a literary review called Big Table, which was charged with obscenity and eventually won the case, adjudicated by Judge Julius Hoffman. Irving Rosenthal moved to New York City where he continued to edit and publish beat writers before returning to San Francisco in 1967 with the intention of setting up his own publishing commune free of censorship. He moved with Hibiscus, founder of the Cockettes, an avant garde psychedelic hippie theater group, and started the Kaliflower commune and the Free Print Shop.  Commune culture  The Kaliflower spirit was one of communalism and cooperation. Many members saw their commune as their family. In one issue of Kaliflower, commune members wrote, \\"Nuclear family members don't usually buy and sell to each other, are in fact communistic, and we wanted nuclear family intimacy among the communes\\". It was common for members of Kaliflower to limit ties to relationships with non-communalist friends. Members gave their savings to the group and were encouraged to quit outside jobs and work inside the community instead. Some commune tasks included gardening, cleaning, cooking, running the Free Print Shop, maintaining a free store, or delivering the newsletter or food to other communes. The community supported a culture of polyamory, resisting attachments to a single sexual partner. Many members slept in a group bedroom and regularly shared sexual partners, participating in what they considered to be a group marriage. Major decisions were made by consensus within the daily meeting of committed community members. The commune also held voluntary criticism sessions to vent concerns with other commune members. During such a session, the member who asked for criticism would invite other members to participate, and then listen in silence while concerns & criticisms were aired. Customarily the member did not respond for three days. This system of self-governance was borrowed from the 19th-century American Utopian community at Oneida, NY.  Publication  The Chief 15 offset located in the Free Print Shop in the basement of the Kaliflower Commune Rosenthal brought his printing press to the basement of Kaliflower, and the space became known as the Free Print Shop, a free, underground publishing venue for Bay Area communes. The flyer for the opening of the Free Print Shop announced, \\"The Sutter Street Commune invites you to submit manuscripts, drawings, manifestos to our Free Print Shop. Free distribution guaranteed for whatever we print.\\" From then on, the Free Print Shop produced hundreds of publication including books, pamphlets, and flyers (for free services, ecology groups, political protests, announcements for free events), Food Conspiracy order sheets, and Free Medical Clinic prescription forms. Starting in April 1969, members of the group worked in the print shop to create Kaliflower, the free, inter-communal newsletter. The newsletter was published weekly between April 1969 and December 1971, & at longer intervals through the present. The name was a play on Kaliyuga, the Hindu name for the last and most violent age of humankind, the idea being that the publication was \\"a step toward a seed of positivity growing out of the age of destruction.\\" The publication's audience grew quickly. After three years, it was delivered to more than 300 communes in the Bay Area, eventually becoming so well known that the commune itself became known as Kaliflower. Every Thursday became known as \\"Kaliflower Day,\\" the day in which Kaliflower was bound and distributed. Each issue of Kaliflower was printed and bound by hand using the Japanese method of overstitching yarn on either the top or side. The newsletter began as a \\"inter-communal bulletin board\\" and became a vital mode of communication amongst the communes. It listed items that one commune needed or had to offer; upcoming free events; announcements, free ads, and how-to and skill sharing articles. For instance, one article from November 20, 1970 contained articles on how to build cold boxes to grow food and a recipe for squash soup. One from December 10, 1970 had an article titled \\"Yoga Nazal Cleaning\\" and information on herbal hair care. Over time, it came to offer a broader range of information about collective living including historical context for communalism and utopianism often citing information from the Revivalist communes in the 1820s and 1840s, most notably the Oneida Commune of John Humphrey Noyes.  Free Food Conspiracy  The Free Food Conspiracy (later named the Free Food Family) was organized in 1968, in part by Kaliflower members. The organization was one of the original food conspiracies, groups that pooled food stamps and other resources from participating communes and bought food in bulk which they distributed to participants on the basis of need. By pooling resources, early food co-ops like the Free Food Conspiracy saved shopping time and provided high quality food for low bulk prices. By 1973, the organization reached over 150 communes, saving money and increasing cooperation between the communes. Kaliflower expressed hope that one day local communes would eventually pool enough resources to buy property and land; however the Free Food Conspiracy disbanded in 1973 due to resistance against giving up \\"imported cheeses and health food extravagances\\" in exchange for a more basic diet.  Free Food Conspiracy legacy  Congress saw the Free Food Conspiracy and other resource-sharing plans like it as abuses of welfare. Due to recognition of the Free Food Conspiracy and others like it by Congress the US Supreme Court struck down the commune clause under the equal protection provision of the 5th Amendment in USDA v. Moreno so that communes are no longer able to receive food stamps like other households. Although the Free Food Conspiracy disbanded in 1973, the organization spurred the creation of many food co-ops as people saw the benefits of organizing wholesale buying operations. The Free Food Conspiracy was a predecessor of many anti-capitalist resource sharing programs including other cooperative food systems, bicycle repair workshops, community gardens, and farmers' markets. It inspired the Food Not Bombs program, an all-volunteer run global movement that shares free vegan meals as a protest to war and poverty. The Free Food Conspiracy also gave rise to the Really Really Free Market, a movement of temporary markets based on the gift economy where participants bring unneeded items, food, and skills like haircuts to a community space to share with other participants with the principle of countering capitalism.  Impact  Rebirth and Development, 2019 All in Common Garden, 2019 Kaliflower helped create the culture of Haight-Ashbury and the San Francisco hippie movement during the 1970s. The commune that produced it influenced the formation, structure, and principles of many other communes including The House of Love and Prayer and the One Mind Temple (which became the St. John Coltrane Church). Its existence continues to inspire the creation of other utopian, anti-capitalist communes and resource-sharing groups with similar values. In 1974, the commune moved to the Mission District at 23rd and Shotwell Streets and became a new organization, Rebirth and Development. As of 2011, it continues to host services such as a food pantry, referrals to free services, and a free community garden. As of 2015, the community garden (All in Common Garden) supported the Free Farm Stand on Sundays at Parque Ni√±os Unidos at 23rd and Treat Streets, which is organized by a person who was part of the commune.  Representation in media  Kaliflower is referenced in The Cockettes, a film by David Weissman and Bill Weber about a psychedelic, San Francisco based, gender-bending theater group founded by Hibiscus, one of the first members of the Kaliflower commune. Kaliflower is mentioned in The Fabulous Sylvester: The Legend, the Music, the Seventies in San Francisco, a biography by Joshua Gamson about the life of Sylvester, a queer, American singer and performer popular for his disco music. Sylvester did not live at the Kaliflower house, but another cofounder of the Cockettes, Hibiscus, had been part of Kaliflower.

Feminist institutionalism focuses on how institutions are gendered and how their formal and informal rules play a part in shaping political life. It offers a new way of interpreting the formation of institutions that goes beyond traditional views by accounting for the gendered stigma and gendered outcomes that comes with institutions. As a result, feminist institutionalism is changing the face of various institutions by providing awareness into their very own dynamics of inclusion and exclusion. Feminist institutionalism touches upon all areas involved in the construction of institutions and has a direct effect on things such as policies, legislations, laws and/or quotas, and many more. Gender plays an important role in this process by impacting both power relations and social interactions, because it is through the understanding of gender that individuals classify and rate masculinity and femininity throughout various institutions. This form of new institutionalism plays an active role from within, seeking to alter the ways in which it operates and how it is institutionally framed by having an influence on its policies and outcomes. A feminist perspective aims to help with understanding the framework that starts to shape between gendered institutional subjects and the environment, and also aims to provide an insight on how institutions can be re-gendered.  History  New institutionalism began to emerge as a topic of discussion among scholars and literature in the 19th and 20th century, from that feminist institutionalism began to stem. Feminist institutionalism came to be popular because many feminist political scientists wanted to highlight the ways in which there is a gendered lens on political institutions. Feminist institutionalism has been looked at as adding a new dimension of understanding to new institutionalism in terms of power and the dynamics of inclusion and exclusion. Feminist institutionalism wishes to touch upon both the strengths and limitations of institutions. In the past feminist institutionalism has critiqued institutions for their gendered blindness of the existing field, and highlights that gender is embedded in political institutions and that in turn this is shaping social interactions. Initiatives and organizations have formed to promote and make the public more aware of feminism and institutionalism. In 1987 the Feminist Majority Foundation (FMF) formed in the United States. They are dedicated to research and action to empower women economically, socially and politically, this group aims to advance the legal, social and political equality of women with men. Another organization founded in 1987 is Institute for Women's Policy Research whose aim is to advance women's status by developing new policy ideas, encouraging public debate and promoting sound policy and program development through a gendered lends. More recently in 2006 the Feminism and Institutional International Network (FIIN) emerged with scholars from Scotland, England, Denmark, Sweden and the USA participating in their workshops. This network aims to look at the approaches of gendered institutions and how these approaches address issues of gender, politics, power and change. Since then these scholars have gone on to publish a hand full of research papers on the topic.  Gender Roles  Gender makes up a big part of feminist institutionalism, and is one of the main driving factors that pushes and influences research on institutionalism. Gender underlines choices that are being made and is ever present in the subconscious, guiding final decisions concerning institutions. Many scholars believe that gender is something that has been overlooked, leaving gaps in research and having potential institutional processes missed. Acknowledging gendered institutions means that gender is present in various sectors of social life such as practices, processes, images and ideologies and the distribution of power. Political institutions are guided and influenced by gender through social norms and bias that are created in the public sphere. Institutions such as law, politics, religion, state and the economy have historically been developed by men and have been interpreted through a male perspective, leaving out the standpoint of women. Although gender relations play out differently depending on the specific context, there is a broad agreement among scholars that masculinized gender is embedded in political institutions that are established by and for men. Gender is built into the fabric of institutions it is not something that has been added on, in this sense political and policy making institutions are structured by gendered assumptions and produce outcomes such as policies, legislation and rulings that are influenced by these gender norms. Gender can not be overlooked in the broader scope of new institutionalism, a greater understanding of its role needs to be implemented. Recognizing that gender is present in institutions and social interactions provides new insights and power dimensions of political institutions.  Policies   Implementation  Feminist institutionalist aim to have policies placed on the political agenda that work to empower women and put them at equal standing with men. Government bodies are dominantly made up of men which feminist and women activists argue that certain policies will be overlooked or not implemented at all because women's opinions are missing from this debate. Policies that are implemented that reflect feminist institutionalism, must go through a process of outside women fighting for their cause. Implementation of feminist policies entails energy from movements and activists while also creating allies within the government who become a crucial factor to getting an issue on the policy agenda. The type of government that is in power at the time of these policy decisions plays a factor in which policies will and will not be implemented. The election of different governments have downgraded feminist institutional status and their position in such a way that their ability to shape policy has become insignificant. Shifting government comes with a change in opinions which can either move these feminist policies forward or push them aside. In Canada and the United Kingdom it is difficult for women to operate within the bureaucracy for fear of being looked at as biased and also women may feel a sense of tension towards them as advocating for women has not been welcomed in these institutions. In contrast the Australian government, especially between 1975‚Äì1995, feminists pushed for the state and federal government to create women's policy agencies in which they were able to work, through this they were able to make policies to confront issues of child care, budget, pensions and violence against women.  Quotas  Quotas are one of the most frequently used policies that are put in place to aid feminist institutionalist. Quotas touch multiple domains of institutions to help bring more women into the work sphere and help them attain higher positions within the government. Recently more countries around the world have started to adopt quotas, with more than 100 countries putting quotas in place. Quotas are also supported by the international community, the United Nations (UN), the European Union (EU), the African Union and the Southern African Development Community have all put quotas in place that aim to have 30% women in all political bodies in the past 10 years. Gender and party quotas are put in place to not only increase the number of women that will be holding office positions but is a way to design the selection process in such a way that they are able to identify not just suitable candidates but suitable female candidates. Quota policies that target the increase in women having a position in office can be traced back to the UN Fourth World Conference of Women where women's issues were discussed on the agenda. These quotas have achieved significant increase in the actual number of women holding office.  Government Branches  Women are underrepresented in government institutions compared to the number of men represented in the same institutions. Women have had lower levels of descriptive representation in both the executive and legislative branches of the government, due to this these systems should be regarded and analyzed as such. Women have been positioned as outsiders to these government institutions leaving them incapable of having access to political power. Men have access to a homosocial capital that is used in order to build networks and gain power within this hierarchy, and in contrast women do not have the same access to this crucial capital. Quota laws are commonly used in government framework to increase the number of female candidates and female legislators. Quotas can either be implemented and regulated by the government or they can be voluntarily taken on, party quotas are taken on voluntarily by parties that commit to reaching a certain number of women within its candidates. The right kind of quota law placed with the right set of conditions can generate significant increases in the election of female candidates, which allows for greater representation across various institutions. Countries such as Rwanda have stated that women must hold at least 30% of political positions, other countries have also put into effect reserved seats which requires that a minimum number of candidates must be female instead of a percentage, guaranteeing that women will be elected. Political parties are gendered organizations within government institutions, they are characterized by traditional concepts of gender relations. The role that women play within political parties are affected by that parties character, structure and ideology and how open they are to including women within their framework. Feminist institutionalist see females as crucial actors in initiating change within these institutions. Having more women in these institutions acts as a resource for other women to feel more comfortable and operate better within these positions.  Critiques of Feminist Institutionalism  Feminist Institutionalism is often critiqued for having its limitations and not always benefiting those involved. Feminist institutional work often focuses on gender specific policies and institutions and has neglected to explore other outlets. Although feminist institutionalism is growing, institutional arenas remain dominated by men even with measures such as quotas and legislation being put in place, allowing for critique that these measures may not be effective. In some countries there has been little change recorded or countries have experienced setbacks with the number of women that are elected to national assemblies. Feminist institutionalists are critiqued for not having an influence inside institutions. Once they are elected into certain positions or placed in positions of power, women still have to abide by old rules, limiting the amount of change they can accomplish. It has also been critiqued that shifts within institutions are not permanent, thus any change or policies put in place by feminist institutionalists can be removed and altered.

The lake formed and dispersed during the Wisconsin glaciation. The lake existed in several forms, with several prominent shorelines observable in modern geology. At its greatest extent, the lake surface area was approximately half the size of modern-day Lake Ontario, and possibly much larger. The basin of the lake lay within an area bordered by the Alaska Range to the north, the Wrangell Mountains to the east, the Chugach Mountains to the south, and the Talkeetna Mountains to the west. Lake Atna may have generated several of the largest ever glacial lake outburst floods. One such flood may have contributed to the destruction caused by the 1964 Alaska earthquake.  Discovery  In 1898, Frank Charles Schrader undertook a study of the Copper River Basin for the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Based on sedimentary evidence, he concluded a possibility of a large body of standing water being responsible for the deposits. This could have been an arm of the sea. In 1901, with A. C. Spencer, he concluded these deposits were only in limited areas, disagreeing with his earlier conclusion. This conclusion was supported by Walter Curran Mendenhall in 1905, who had studied the Pleistocene deposits in the central region of the basin. In 1954, Fred Howard Moffit noted that topographic conditions were favorable for the possibility of a large lake, but that specific evidence was lacking at that time. In 1957, geologists Oscar J. Ferrians and H.R. Schmoll concluded the basin had been resident to a large proglacial lake during the Wisconsin glaciation. The lake was named Lake Atna by geologist D. J. Nichols of the USGS in 1965.  Geological history  The bluffs near the confluence of the Gakona and Copper Rivers expose nearly 300 ft of the Quaternary lacustrine, alluvial, and glacial deposits that fill the Copper River Basin. Most of the section seen in this view consists of finely laminated to indistinctly bedded sand, silt, and clay, with or without coarser material, that was deposited in glacial Lake Atna. During the Miocene Epoch, the region saw significant tectonic uplift through which the ancestral Copper River maintained its course. Sometime before 40 ka, the basin was free of water and ice, and covered in spruce forest. During the Wisconsin glaciation, a multitude of glaciers extended into and blocked drainage exits from the Copper River Basin. The lake formed at least as early as 58 ka during the Pleistocene period as a result of glacial damming along the middle and lower valleys of the river, impounding the lake in the Copper River Basin. The highest surface level the lake achieved was , based on sedimentation in the northwestern area of the basin. Multiple strand lines exist in the basin indicating sustained lake levels at a maximum of above modern sea level and other lower levels including , , , and above modern sea level. During its early formation, the lake likely had no permanent outlet. The damming glaciers that created the lake became large enough that the lake was endorheic, though it may have periodically topped its glacial dams. The final draining and disappearance of the lake likely happened no later than approximately 9.4 ka through the Copper River Valley. Isostatic rebound effects of departing ice sheets and the draining of Lake Atna from the basin remain uncertain, as detailed study of the shorelines in the basin has not been conducted. In 2006, John Jangala, an archaeologist with the Bureau of Land Management indicated that Lake Atna may have been a remnant of an earlier lake called Lake Susitna. This was contradicted by Michael Wiedmer in 2011 who stated that no evidence exists for an independent Lake Susitna. The detailed history of the lake and its extent over time remain uncertain, as further investigation is required.  Megaflood history  Map showing geographic features related to Lake Atna In 2005, Michael Wiedmer, then a biologist at the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, was shown the carcass of a pygmy whitefish which had been collected from Lake George. This lake sits near the face of Knik Glacier, some distance from the Copper River Basin area. Pygmy whitefish are known to exist in remnant lakes of Lake Atna. This offered a clue as to a water connection that may have existed at some time in the past between Lake Atna and Lake George. Wiedmer also observed the presence of large, symmetrical hills in the Matanuska Valley, possibly of fluvial origin. This led Wiedmer to investigate the possibility of a megaflood down the valley from ancient Lake Atna. Wiedmer's resulting research was published in a 2010 paper titled \\"Late Quaternary megafloods from Glacial Lake Atna, Southcentral Alaska, U.S.A.\\", with co-authors from the Quaternary Research Center at the University of Washington. Wiedmer's research suggested the possibility of Lake Atna being a serial generator of megafloods from glacial dam failures. One such possible flood originated from a catastrophic failure of a glacial dam in height at Tahneta Pass, located at the eastern end of Matanuska Valley. Wiedmer's maximum estimates of this flood place its size at a 2.0‚Äì3.3 √ó 106m3s‚àí1 (2.0‚Äì3.3 million cubic meters per second) discharge rate. The velocity estimates of this flood range from a minimum of to . The flood released a maximum of of water into the Wasilla region over the span of a week. The intensity of the release was such that it created dunes in height, with crests of the dunes and more apart. The dunes still exist today. Other glacial dam outbursts may have occurred down the Susitna River, through Mentasta Pass into the Tok River, and down the Copper River itself. The Susitna River outburst may have been responsible for a flood three to four times more intense than the Tahneta Pass outburst, at a 7.0‚Äì11.3 √ó 106m3s‚àí1 discharge rate. This flood may have discharged nearly twice as much water as the Tahneta Pass outburst. The postulated glacial dam height for this flood was .  Remnants and effects  The Copper River Basin as it is now, looking east from Glenn Highway towards Mt. Drum. Lake Atna covered this basin. Diamicton, glacial, glaciolacustrine, and lacustrine origin deposits exist in many areas of the Copper River Basin. All major rivers present today occupy narrow valleys that have cut up to into the bottom of the basin. Lacustrine sediments of the lake are visible in many river bluffs throughout the basin. Several extant lakes in the basin are remnants of the lake, including Tazlina Lake, Klutina Lake, and Tonsina Lake. Much of the unconsolidated fill of the basin is in permafrost, down to a maximum depth of in the central basin area. The postulated Matanuska Valley flood produced by Lake Atna 17,000 years ago may have been responsible for the deposition of a thin stratum of clay and silt grains in the Anchorage area. The collapse of this stratum caused catastrophic landslides in the Anchorage area during the 1964 Alaska earthquake contributing to the collapse of structures built above it.

The Ulster Defence Association (UDA), a loyalist paramilitary group from Northern Ireland, claimed responsibility for the bombing. It was one of a series of loyalist bomb attacks in the Republic of Ireland between the late 1960s and mid 1970s. Background Loyalists had been carrying out bomb attacks in the Republic of Ireland, mainly in Dublin, and in border counties Cavan, Donegal, Louth and Monaghan, since the beginning of the Troubles in August 1969. Several of these had resulted in fatalities. Three civilians were killed and almost 200 injured in the 1972 and 1973 Dublin bombings, while 34 civilians were killed in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings in 1974, the deadliest attack of the Troubles.Conway, Vicky.

It killed Aer Lingus worker John Hayes (38), who lived in Balbriggan, and injured nine others.McKittrick, David. Lost Lives. Random House, 2001. p.600 According to bomb experts the bomb was hidden in a toilet tissue dispenser and went off after Hayes washed his hands and was about to leave. The blast ripped through a wall into a public bar where about thirty people were sitting. The airport was evacuated and a second bomb was found and safely detonated by a bomb disposal team. Aftermath The UDA claimed responsibility for the bombing shortly after. It said it was \\"retaliation for the murders of members of the British security forces In this instance, British security forces includes both the British Army and the RUC. by the IRA operating unhindered from the haven of the Republic with the blessing of the Dublin government\\". Political leaders and the main political parties condemned the bombing. Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Gerry Fitt said it was \\"crazy that the UDA was still a fully legalised organisation\\" in the United Kingdom. The UDA bombed Dublin again 11 years later in November 1986, planting four small bombs in bins.

Previously, he directed one of DARPA‚Äôs technical offices, where he oversaw nation-scale scientific and engineering research in cybersecurity, data analysis, and artificial intelligence. He is known for research and entrepreneurship in the implementation and application of functional programming languages. In 2010, Launchbury was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery.  Education  Launchbury received first-class honors in mathematics from Oxford University in 1985, and an M.Sc. in computation in 1986. He holds a Ph.D. in computing science from the University of Glasgow. In 1991, the Cambridge University Press published his thesis, Projection Factorizations in Partial Evaluation, after it won the British Computer Society's distinguished dissertation prize.  Career and research  As a lecturer at the University of Glasgow, Launchbury focused his early research on the semantics and analysis of lazy functional languages and was one of the contributing designers of the Haskell programming language. In 1993, Launchbury provided a formal description of lazy evaluation, addressing challenges in analyzing a program‚Äôs storage requirements. The operational semantics is widely cited in later research on Haskell. In the context of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler team, Launchbury established an effective partnership with Simon L. Peyton Jones to write a number of papers that dramatically influenced the design of Haskell. Their 1995 paper on State in Haskell introduced the ‚ÄúIO monad‚Äù as a mathematically-clean practical way of expressing effects on the external world, and solidified the ‚Äúdo-notation‚Äù Launchbury had introduced earlier. Their papers on unboxed values and removal of intermediate data structures addressed many of the efficiency challenges inherent in lazy evaluation. In 1994, Launchbury relocated to the West Coast of the United States, becoming a full professor at the Oregon Graduate Institute in 2000. His research there addressed the creation and optimization of domain-specific programming languages (DSLs) ranging from fundamental research in combining disparate semantic elements, through embedding DSLs in Haskell, to applied research for modeling and reasoning about very-large scale integration (VLSI) micro-architectures. Launchbury founded Galois Inc. in 1999 to address challenges in information assurance through the application of functional programming and formal methods.

Biography She was born in 1912 to one of Key West's original families. By 1935, she was a science teacher and taught summer school at Tulane University. She graduated from Florida State College for Women in 1937. She served as treasurer and board member of a local volunteer credit union (later Keys Federal Credit Union) in the 1940s. She married C.B.

She served as the first female mayor and the first female commissioner of Monroe County, and was the first to be elected Mayor Emeritus. In April 1982, citizens of Key West formed the Conch Republic, a satirical micronation, in response to a Border Patrol checkpoint that disrupted travel and tourist activity. Harvey became Admiral and First Sea Lord of the Conch Republic's navy, whose actions included attacking a Coast Guard cutter with loaves of stale Cuban bread. The Conch Republic became a Key West mainstay as a tourist attraction and a humorous method for the cityto negotiate with state and federal governments. During the 1995 \\"invasion\\", she stopped and accepted surrender from Army Reserve troops.

Later, they were transferred to Auschwitz, where they were all put to death over the course of two years. During his time at Theresienstadt, he continued to create drawings and watercolors, but no one knew of their existence until 1950, when they were discovered in the bricked-up attic of a house that was undergoing reconstruction.

Guevara then attempted to commit suicide by shooting himself but missed, then ran out of ammunition. Students Ana Cecilia Ramos and Luis Fernando Mart√≠nez, both 14 years old, and 24-year- old teacher Cecilia Cristina Sol√≠s, suffered critical head injuries. They were listed in critical condition. After two months, Cecilia died in the hospital.A 14-year-old Mariel Ch√°vez suffered an arm injury. He was declared stable. Guevara had psychological problems. The perpetrator eventually committed suicide by gunshot and died several hours later at a Monterrey hospital after suffering brain death.  Background  Due to the notorious increase of violence and insecurity on several states of Mexico, beginning in 2007, the Secretariat of Public Education of Mexico implemented in the states of Baja California, Chihuahua, Federal District, Guerrero, Jalisco, Mexico, Michoac√°n, Sinaloa and Quintana Roo, the Safe School Program, which aims to promote environments of security and healthy coexistence, favorable for the improvement of learning, as well as the practice of \\"civic and ethical values\\". Among the actions foreseen by the program, \\"Safe Backpack\\" was included, an operation held at the entrance of schools consisting of reviewing the students' backpacks in order to detect the entry of weapons or drugs to the facilities. At the time of the attack, according to Aldo Fasci, prosecutor of the state of Nuevo Le√≥n, the operation in that state was being applied in 90% of public schools, but in certain private schools, as in the case of the school involved, there were no checks, due mainly to complaints from parents.  Shooting  At 8:51 a.m., at the Colegio Americano del Noreste (English: Northeastern American College), Guevara, who was seated at his desk, took out a .22 caliber firearm and shot at one of his classmates at point-blank range, then shot his teacher Cecilia Sol√≠s and other peers, between 13 and 14 years of age. He then attempted to shoot himself in the right temple but failed as he missed, then the firearm ran out of ammunition. He reloaded the weapon with cartridges stored in a nearby box and shot himself in the chin. He died later in the hospital. A video of the attack, recorded by the closed circuit installed in the classroom, was published by Mexican newspaper Reforma. Due to the material circulating fast on social networks such as Twitter and Facebook, the Mexican Secretary of the Interior, Miguel Angel Osorio Chong declared that it had instructed to the verification of the images and videos of the event considering the dignity of the victims. Governor Rodr√≠guez Calder√≥n called the action of sharing the video as \\"perverse and morbid\\", while the state prosecutor said that there would be punishment to whoever leaked the video to the media.  Reactions  The then President of Mexico, Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, through his Twitter account, lamented the event \\"as a parent and as president.\\" Later, in a video, the President stated that security in Mexican classrooms was a national competition, \\"and what happens in our classrooms, is not only an issue that involves managers and teachers, it is a concern of all of us.\\" The governor of the state of Nuevo Le√≥n, Jaime Rodr√≠guez Calder√≥n, lamented the shooting, expressed solidarity with the families of the victims and called for parents to care for their children, \\"watch what they do, what they feel, what they say, let our families become stronger, let us not let violence gain us and let's return to values.\\" The country's Secretary of Public Education, Aurelio Nu√±o Mayer, described the incident as \\"unacceptable violence,\\" and assured that it will follow up on the case. Enrique Graue Wiechers, rector of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, said that the event could be caused by a society \\"that is losing many values.\\" Several senators lamented the facts, calling for the education of families in the homes and to implement programs of revisions of backpacks. In this regard, lawmaker Ang√©lica de la Pe√±a rejected the claims appealing to a measure that criminalizes children in school age. On the night of January 18, students' families and relatives arrived at the school's gate, where they placed flowers, candles and white balloons.  Aftermath  A day after the shooting, Google joined the support and added a little black ribbon as a backing for the tragedy and victim families. Also a day after the shooting, the Facebook account of the school was hacked by a group on the website called \\"Legi√≥n Holk\\", a place where the perpetrator supposedly posted a message a day before the shooting announcing what he would do the next day. Mexican authorities have since stated they believe these are apocryphal accounts.

It includes \\"the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of persons by means of threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power, or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs.\\" Human trafficking is a growing problem in Utah. Human trafficking laws On June 19, 1862, the United States made slavery illegal in all US territories, including Utah territory, effectively overturning the Act in Relation to Service. Currently, the Mann Act and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA), are used to prosecute human trafficking cases in Utah that cross state lines. Under the TVPA, human trafficking includes any exploitation of a minor or the use of force, fraud or coercion on an adult. In 2008, Utah passed Human Trafficking Amendments to the Utah Code, which prohibited human trafficking within the state of Utah. Unlike the TVPA, Utah defines human trafficking as \\"forced labor or forced sexual exploitation\\". Unlike the TVPA, Utah law makes no exceptions for minors. Because Utah requires proof of force, even for minors, prosecutions in Utah are very difficult. Utah law also does not allocate any funds for victims or give them special rights. However, the Utah legislative is looking into expanding existing laws on human trafficking. Anti-human trafficking efforts In 2012, Shared Hope International chose Salt Lake City as one of ten areas for in-depth study for child sex trafficking. The report criticized Salt Lake City's handling of domestic minor sex trafficking. They say that victims are held like juvenile delinquents, that buyers of sex acts from minors are not punished, and that training to identify sex trafficking victims are minimal. They noted that even though almost everyone they interviewed had worked with a child sex trafficking case in the last two years, there were very few arrests. They point to weak laws. Since the report was released, there has been a cultural change, and cases that would have previously been handled as prostitution are now being handled as human trafficking. This is partially because law enforcement is now better educated and lawmakers are giving them better tools to identify cases of human trafficking. In 2016, the Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Force helped make 71 arrests in Utah, as part of an anti-human trafficking sting operation known as Operation Broken Heart III. Human trafficking rings have also been found to be operating out of Bountiful, using hotels in Salt Lake City to sell their victims, and in Thai massage parlors across the Wasatch Front.

Brown (born February 20, 1941) is an African American pastor and civil rights activist. He is the president of the San Francisco branch of the NAACP, and has been the pastor of the Third Baptist Church of San Francisco since 1976. Brown was one of only eight students who took the only college class ever taught by Martin Luther King Jr. Early life and education Brown was born in Jackson, Mississippi, in 1941. His great-grandfather was born a slave in Franklin County, Mississippi. Brown's father worked as a rural church pastor and janitor. In 1955, Brown organized the NAACP's first youth council. He first met Martin Luther King at the 1956 NAACP national convention in San Francisco, which he attended at the invitation of Medgar Evers, who drove Brown there personally. In 1959, Brown criticized segregated schools in an interview with the Cleveland Plain Dealer. In response, he was barred from returning for his senior year at the then-segregated Jim Hill High School. Medgar Evers, then field secretary of the NAACP, intervened, threatening a lawsuit to force desegregation of a nearby white high school. Brown was let back into Jim Hill, but was no longer allowed to be president of the student council (which was demolished), nor to hold the positions of senior class president or valedictorian that he was elected to by his fellow students. Brown attended Morehouse College, graduating in 1964, and then entered Crozer Theological Seminary. Martin Luther King wrote one of Brown's recommendation letters, and served as an \\"unofficial dean\\" of the black students at the school, his own alma mater. Brown attended a seminar in social philosophy that King co-taught with college minister Samuel Woodrow Williams. Brown was one of only eight students hand-selected for the class. After earning a master of divinity from Crozer, Brown later went on to receive a doctor of ministry from United Theological Seminary. Career and activism Brown became senior pastor of the Third Baptist Church of San Francisco in 1976. He has served as national chairman for the NAACP Youth and College Division and the National Baptist Commission on Civil Rights. He is president of the San Francisco branch of the NAACP. He is also on the board of directors of the NAACP. In 1991, Brown testified at the Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination hearings on behalf of the National Baptist Convention of America, the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc., and the Progressive National Baptist Convention. He stated that the votes of the conventions were virtually unanimous in their opposition to the nomination of Thomas. Amos C. Brown was a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1998. Brown served on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors from 1996 to 2001. He was originally appointed by Mayor Willie Brown in 1996, then elected to a two-year term in 1999. While a member of the Board of Supervisors, he proposed an ordinance that would prohibit standing on a street corner for more than five minutes, with loiterers facing a $250 fine and up to six months imprisonment. He failed to win re-election to the board in the year 2000. Brown said in an interview that the origins of the student sit-in movement has been \\"romanticized... or mis-stated\\". According to Brown, the first organized \\"sit-down movement\\", as it was then referred to, was in Oklahoma City in August 1958, led by the NAACP Youth Council. In 1961, Brown was arrested along with Martin Luther King Jr. at a lunch counter sit- in. He also joined the Freedom Riders that year. Brown is a supporter of LGBT rights. He spoke in favor of the California gay rights bill in 1991. He faced criticism from some black ministers for his support of same-sex marriage and opposition to Proposition 8 in California in 2008. In 2012, he joined the NAACP National Board in voting overwhelmingly in favor of supporting marriage equality. Brown supports the legalization of marijuana, and has called for more African Americans to have a voice in the medical cannabis industry. Brown has called for reparations to be paid to black people, to aid in economic empowerment and compensate for deficiencies in education. Brown volunteered for Operation Crossroads Africa in 1964, spending over two months on the west coast of Africa. He has visited the continent over 20 times since then. Under his leadership, the Third Baptist Church has sponsored many African refugees, and enabled 80 children from Tanzania to receive heart surgery in the United States.

The company was founded by industry veteran Don Johnson in 1982, who purchased some assets of Pickwick Records from its parent company and named his new label Intersound. The company initially focused on releasing licensed recordings of classical music, but gradually moved towards signing contemporary artists until the classical releases, which had once made 95% of the company's revenue, accounted for just 5% of sales. Intersound pursued a unique business model of primarily selling directly to retailers via an in- house distribution system, instead of partnering with a third-party distributor as major labels typically did. Intersound was headquartered in Roswell, Georgia, where it operated a large production and warehousing facility. In November 1996, Platinum Entertainment acquired Intersound in a $29 million cash and debt deal.

Flores was a leader of the Nationalist faction of Mayag√ºez, Puerto Rico during the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party revolts of the 1950s. On March 1, 1954, Flores together with fellow Nationalists Lolita Lebr√≥n, Andr√©s Figueroa Cordero, and Rafael Cancel Miranda entered the United States Capitol building armed with automatic pistols and fired 30 shots. Five congressmen were wounded, however all the representatives survived and Flores, along with the other three members of his group were immediately arrested. Early years Flores (birth name: Irvin Flores Rodr√≠guez ) was born in the town of Cabo Rojo in Puerto Rico. He was raised together with his five brothers and sisters by an aunt after his mother died and he became an orphan. It was in Cabo Rojo where Flores received his primary and secondary education. After he graduated from high school, he studied electronics in a local vocational school.Los Angeles TimesNew York Times: Irvin Flores, 69, Dies; Wounded 5 in CongressWhite Star Puerto Rican Nationalist Party The Puerto Rican Nationalist Party was founded by Jos√© Coll y Cuch√≠ as a direct response to the American colonial government in 1919, By the 1920s, there were two other pro- independence organizations in the Island, they were the \\"Nationalist Youth\\" and the \\"Independence Association of Puerto Rico\\". On September 17, 1922, the two political organizations merged into the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. In 1924, Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos joined the party and on May 11, 1930, Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos was elected president of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party.Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, By A. W. Maldonado, Pg. 86, Publisher: La Editorial, Universidad de Puerto Rico , (December 1, 2006) , , There were sub-groups within the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. The Puerto Rican Youth for Independence was one of them. School students would often meet to discuss the political issues of the day. Independence leader Rafael Cancel Miranda was present in one of the meetings that Flores attended where the political discussion was about Puerto Rican independence. Cancel Miranda invited Flores to join the Puerto Rican Youth for Independence and he did. Flores eventually joined the Nationalist Party and became a member of the Cadets of the Republic (Cadetes de la Republica). The cadets was a quasi-military youth organization of the Nationalist Party also known as the Liberation Army of Puerto Rico . During this time in his life he personally met Dr. Albizu Campos who encouraged him to take up public speaking. Puerto Rican Nationalist Party revolts of the 1950s The Puerto Rican Nationalist Party revolts of the 1950s were a series of coordinated armed protests for the independence of Puerto Rico led by Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos, against the United States Government rule on the Island. The Party repudiated the \\"Free Associated State\\" (Estado Libre Asociado) status that had been enacted in 1950 and which the Nationalists considered a continuation of colonialism. The Party organized a series of uprisings to take place in various Puerto Rican cities on October 30, 1950. Flores was a leader of the Nationalist faction of Mayag√ºez. This was one of the largest branches of the party. It was divided into several units, each assigned to attack different targets. He participated in the group which attacked the town's police station, resulting in the death of three policemen and three bystanders. This unit regrouped and joined the other units in Barrio La Quinta of the municipality of Mayag√ºez. The local police arrived and Flores was wounded. He was able to escape into the mountains with the rest of the men. The unit avoided further casualties by using guerrilla tactics. Flores continued to hide in the mountain farms unaware that the FBI was after him, not because of his participation in the revolt, but because he had avoided conscription and refused to register for the draft. Eventually, he was captured and briefly incarcerated. After he was released, he moved to New York City. Preparations for the assault In New York, Flores worked in a furniture factory. There he continued his friendship with Cancel Miranda who introduced him to the Nationalist Party branch of that city. He met fellow nationalists Lolita Lebr√≥n and Andres Figueroa Cordero during one of his visits to the party headquarters. In 1954, Lebr√≥n received a letter from Albizu Campos, in which he declared his intention to order attacks on \\"three locations, the most strategic to the enemy\\".Ribes Tovar et al., p.132 Albizu Campos wanted Lebr√≥n to pick a group of nationalists for this task without her personal participation. Lebr√≥n presented the plan to the Nationalist Party in New York and choose Cancel Miranda, Flores and Andr√©s Figueroa Cordero for the task. Disregarding Albizu Campo's wishes, she decided to lead the group. The date for the attack on the House of Representatives was to be March 1, 1954. This date was chosen because it coincided with the inauguration of the Conferencia Interamericana (Interamerican Conference) in Caracas. Lebr√≥n intended to call attention to Puerto Rico's independence cause, particularly among the Latin American countries participating in the conference. Assault on the House of Representatives Flores arrived with the group in Washington, D.C. and sat in the visitor's gallery in the House of Representatives. The representatives of the House were discussing Mexico's economy when suddenly Lebr√≥n gave the order to the group to quickly recited the Lord's Prayer. She then stood up and shouted \\"¬°Viva Puerto Rico Libre!\\" (\\"Long live a Free Puerto Rico!\\") and unfurled the flag of Puerto Rico. The group opened fire with semi- automatic pistols.Edward F. Ryan, The Washington Post, March 2, 1954, pp.1, 12-13. Some 30 shots were fired (mostly by Cancel, according to his account), wounding five lawmakers; one representative, Alvin Morell Bentley from Michigan, was seriously wounded in the chest. Upon being arrested, Lebr√≥n yelled: Arrest and trial Lebr√≥n, Cancel Miranda and Figueroa Cordero were immediately arrested. Flores, however, walked away from the building in the confusion that followed. He took a taxi to a bus stop where he, and various Mexicans who happened to be there, were stopped and questioned by the local police who had just heard about the shooting. The police searched Flores and found a loose bullet in his pocket which led to his arrest. Flores and his comrades were charged with attempted murder and other crimes. The trial began on June 4, 1954, with judge Alexander Holtzoff presiding over the case, under strict security measures. A jury composed of seven men and five women was assembled, their identities were kept secret by the media. The prosecution was led by Leo A. Rover, as part of this process 33 witnesses testified. Ruth Mary Reynolds, the \\"American/Puerto Rican Nationalist\\", with the aid of the American League for Puerto Rico's Independence, helped to defend the four Nationalists involved in the shooting incident.Ribes Tovar et al., p.178 On July 13, 1954, the four nationalists were taken to New York, where they declared themselves not guilty on the charges of \\"trying to overthrow the government of the United States\\".Ribes Tovar et al., p.197 On October 26, 1954, judge Lawrence E. Walsh found all of the accused guilty of conspiracy, sentencing them to six additional years in prison.Ribes Tovar et al., p.209 Imprisonment and release The four Nationalists were sent to different prisons. Flores was sent to Leavenworth Federal Prison in Leavenworth, Kansas, where nationalist Oscar Collazo, who in 1950 attacked the Blair House in a failed attempt to assassinate US President Harry S. Truman, was incarcerated. By 1970, Flores' comrade Cancel Miranda was transferred from Alcatraz Prison to Leavenworth Prison. In 1970, Flores, together with Collazo and Cancel Miranda, participated in a prison strike and stopped working because of the abuses by some of the guards against them.\\"I was expelled by Batista regime, embraced by Cuban revolutionaries\\" While in prison, he studied English and read books on history and philosophy. He also learned how to play the guitar. He wrote a book titled Los Indomitos where he described his prison experience. Both Flores and Cancel Miranda became eligible for parole in July 1979. However, none had applied for parole because of their political beliefs.Jimmy Carter: Puerto Rican Nationalists Announcement of the President's Commutation of Sentences That same year, President Jimmy Carter, under national and international pressure, pardoned Cancel Miranda, Lebr√≥n and Flores. They had served 25 years in prison. Andr√©s Figueroa Cordero had been released from prison earlier because of health issues related to his terminal cancer. The Governor of Puerto Rico Carlos Romero Barcel√≥ publicly opposed the pardons granted by Carter, stating that it would encourage terrorism and undermine public safety. Later years After his release, Flores was reunited with the other nationalists in the house of Rev. Jos√© Torres in Chicago. There he gave a public speech where he stated: He then traveled to New York City where he was scheduled to appear before a crowd at the Church of the Apostle San Pablo. He then proceeded to return to his motherland Puerto Rico where he and his comrades received a hero's welcome by their supporters. The Order of Playa Gir√≥n In 1979, Flores, Lolita Lebr√≥n, Rafael Cancel Miranda and Oscar Collazo were recognized as the embodiment of the directive of their teacher Albizu Campos to exercise valor and sacrifice before representatives of fifty-one countries at the International Conference in Support of Independence for Puerto Rico, held in Mexico City. That same year Flores and his comrades were awarded the Order of Playa Gir√≥n in Cuba.Order of Playa Gir√≥n The Order of Playa Gir√≥n is a national order conferred by the Council of State of Cuba on Cubans or foreigners for their leadership in the struggle against imperialism, colonialism and neo-colonialism, or who have contributed to peace and the progress of humankind. It was established in 1961 and is named after the Playa Gir√≥n (Gir√≥n beach), site of the Cuban victory in the Bay of Pigs Invasion. In Puerto Rico he met and married Blanca Rodr√≠guez Rivera in 1980. He managed a boarding house and continued his political activities involving the advocacy of Puerto Rico's independence. Flores divorced his wife before undergoing surgery for a brain tumor. He was in a coma for three months and on March 20, 1994 he died in his home which was located in Hato Rey, a suburb of Puerto Rico.

It is created by stacking multiple layers of glass cloth, soaked in epoxy resin, and by compressing the resulting material under heat until the epoxy cures. It is manufactured in flat sheets, most often a few millimeters thick. G-10 is very similar to Micarta and carbon fiber laminates, except that glass cloth is used as filler material. (Note that the professional nomenclature of \\"filler\\" and \\"matrix\\" in composite materials may be somewhat counterintuitive when applied to soaking textiles with resin.) G-10 is the toughest of the glass fiber resin laminates and therefore the most commonly used.  Properties G-10 is favored for its high strength, low moisture absorption, and high level of electrical insulation and chemical resistance. These properties are maintained not only at room temperature but also under humid or moist conditions. It was first used as a substrate for printed circuit boards, and its designation, G-10, comes from a National Electrical Manufacturers Association standard for this purpose. Decorative variations of G-10 are produced in many colors and patterns and are especially used to make handles for knives, grips for firearms and other tools. These can be textured (for grip), bead blasted, sanded or polished. Its strength and low density make it useful for other kinds of handcrafting as well.  Hazards  G-10 is generally safe to handle outside of extreme conditions. Hazards can result from cutting or grinding the material, as glass and epoxy dust are well known to contribute to respiratory disorders and increase the risk of developing lung cancer. For any work of this kind, the work space should be appropriately ventilated and masks or respirators must be worn. Epoxy resin is flammable and, once set on fire, will burn violently, giving off poisonous gases. Therefore similar materials like FR-4 containing flame retardant additives have replaced G-10 in many applications. Related materials FR-4 has replaced G-10 in most consumer electronics.

The creation of the Histone Database was stimulated by the X-ray analysis of the structure of the nucleosomal core histone octamer followed by the application of a novel motif searching method to a group of proteins containing the histone fold motif in the early-mid-1990. The first version of the Histone Database was released in 1995 and several updates have been released since then. Current version of the Histone Database - HistoneDB 2.0 - with variants - includes sequence and structural annotations for all five histone types (H3, H4, H2A, H2B, H1) and major histone variants within each histone type. It has many interactive tools to explore and compare sequences of different histone variants from various organisms. The core of the database is a manually curated set of histone sequences grouped into 30 different variant subsets with variant-specific annotations. The curated set is supplemented by an automatically extracted set of histone sequences from the non-redundant protein database using algorithms trained on the curated set. The interactive web site supports various searching strategies in both datasets: browsing of phylogenetic trees; on-demand generation of multiple sequence alignments with feature annotations; classification of histone-like sequences and browsing of the taxonomic diversity for every histone variant.

The circular building sits on the Puutori square, and it once served as a public restroom, hence the pun. History The building was completed in 1933 and it was designed by Totti Sora to serve as the weigh house for the bus station operating at the square. The building was open as a public restroom until 1986. Markku Heikkil√§ and Kaija V√§is√§nen renovated the building and it became a restaurant under the name \\"Puutorin Vessa\\". The restaurant opened on the 6th of June 1997 and it was operated by Heikkil√§ till 2007 and then by Lasse Laaksonen. The restaurant declared bankruptcy in 2014, when it was taken over by Tim Glogan, who opened it as the WaterLoo Pub. At the end of 2018, Tim Glogan sold the business to Kenneth Forsstr√∂m, owner of the Merihelmi Pub Boat on the River Aura. He will reopen it in February 2019 under its original name, Puutorin Vessa.

Each episode consists of four contestants playing as one team who must agree on answers to questions they are given. The longer it takes the team to come to an agreement, the less money the team earns for each question. The series, hosted by Mike Richards, premiered January 19, 2017, with some critics believing that the show's name and timing were appropriate given the tumultuous preceding presidential election and its premiere date coming the day before the inauguration. Gameplay Each episode consists of three rounds. A team of four contestants starts the game; one player is eliminated after two rounds of play. For each question, the team has 60 seconds to unanimously agree on an answer, the available money decreases the longer it takes. Each contestant must enter the same response on their respective panel and then everyone must simultaneously lock in an answer and stop the clock. If the team answers the question correctly, they bank whatever money is left on the clock, if they are wrong, or if time runs out, their bank is reduced by half. The first round consists of three questions. Each question has one correct answer, and the opening value is $5,000. After the first question has been played, the team is afforded two \\"takeovers\\" to use in the rest of the game. To use a takeover, one contestant presses a smaller red button (yellow in season one) in front of them, their answer is then considered to be the team's answer. In the second round, there are again three questions. Each question starts with a value of $10,000 and has two correct answers, the team must select both correct answers in order to get credit. After the second round, the contestants secretly vote on which of them will be eliminated from further play. In order to eliminate a contestant, the other three must agree unanimously. If there is no unanimous agreement, then the contestants are given a 15-second grace period (10 seconds in season one) before their bank begins to drain. Once there is a unanimous agreement, the chosen contestant is eliminated from the show with no winnings. The third round consists of two questions. In season 1, the first required the team to rank three answers in a stated order and started with a value of $15,000. The second had an opening value of $25,000 and 1, 2, or all 3 of the answers could have been correct; the contestants had select all correct answers, and only the correct answers in order to get credit. Starting in season 2, the $15,000 question has two or all three answers being correct, and the team must select all of the correct answers, and only the correct answers, the $25,000 question requires the team to rank the three answers in the correct order. Final Round The money is divided into three unequal shares. The \\"A\\" share is 60% of the team's bank, the \\"B\\" share is 30%, and the \\"C\\" share is 10%. The team has 100 seconds (1:40) to agree on who should receive which share. Once the clock starts, the money begins to drain away. Each contestant must claim a different share, and the team must lock it in to stop the clock and claim the remaining money. If after 50 seconds, no agreement is made, the clock stops briefly, and each contestant, in turn, is given 10 seconds to explain which share they feel they deserve and why. Once each player has pleaded their case, the clock restarts and the money continues to drain. If no agreement is reached, all three contestants leave the show with no money. If all questions are answered correctly, the top prize is worth up to $51,000 (60% of the maximum total bank of $85,000). Production A sneak preview of the series aired on November 26, 2016. Mike Richards, executive producer of The Price Is Right and Let's Make a Deal and former host of GSN's The Pyramid, was chosen to host the show, and the series officially premiered January 19, 2017, an hour before the season four premiere of GSN's Idiotest. When asked about choosing the premiere date for the show, GSN‚Äôs Executive Vice President of Programming, Amy Introcaso-Davis, said \\"Divided is informed by the fractured social landscape, which in turn, reflects the political divide in this country....launching Divided so close to the inauguration, much like a question in the show, was hotly debated! Ultimately we agreed it was a good time to show that although people have many disagreements, it is to everyone‚Äôs benefit to unite.\\" On March 14, 2017, GSN renewed Divided for a second season, with a two-episode premiere on August 15, 2017. On March 30, 2017, a special edition of the show aired with three contestants instead of the usual four, resembling the format on the original British series. During this episode, no mid-game elimination was held. Instead, another question like the $15,000 question was added. Reception Nellie Andreeva of Deadline Hollywood argued that the series was appropriate for its time, noting how the series premiere \\"arrive[d] as the nation ha[d] been left deeply divided by a bruising Presidential campaign and election. That was not lost on GSN executives as they worked on the series.\\" The New York Timess Neil Genzlinger agreed, contending, \\"It‚Äôs tempting to see the show, which seems to bring out the obstinance and belligerence of its contestants, as being born of the fractious period the United States has just been through....it certainly fits perfectly in the current landscape.\\" The November preview episode received 275,000 viewers and a 0.07 18‚Äì49 rating. The actual series premiere saw a sizeable rise in the ratings, with the 9:00 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. EST episodes performing relatively well by GSN's standards, earning 421,000 and 451,000 viewers respectively. On February 23, 2017, the show hit a series high with 500,000 viewers and a 0.13 18‚Äì49 rating.

Fox and Genting Malaysia Berhad agreed in 2013 to build a Twentieth Century Fox World theme park, the first such branded park. With Village Roadshow Theme Parks in 2014, Fox agreed to build a Fox World in South Korea. In November 2015, Fox and Al Ahli Holding Group agreed to build a 20th Century Fox World near Dubai in United Arab Emirates under an agreement that would allow Al Ahli to build a total of four Fox Worlds outside of the US.  Video Games  Fox Interactive (later sold to Vivendi Universal Games in 2003, after taking over publishing rights in 2001, later dissolved in 2006) was 20th Century Fox's first video game division when it was founded in 1994 by former Time Warner Interactive executive Ted Hoff. And Fox Digital Entertainment was the second Fox video game division when it was founded in 2010, but it solely focused on making games for mobile devices. History FoxNext was formed by January 18, 2017, with the announcement of Salil Mehta as division president transferring from his prior post as president of content management for Twentieth Century Fox Film. The division president would answer to Chairman and CEO of Fox Networks Group, and Chairman and CEO of Twentieth Century Fox Film, who at the time were Peter Rice and Stacey Snider, respectively.

The company was founded by Steve Devick in 1991, who reorganized his River North Studios recording studio into a record label. The company initially sold primarily gospel music, but diversified into other genres, primarily by signing older but still active acts instead of developing new artists. In 1994, Platinum acquired Diadem, a label active in the Christian music industry, and purchased Intersound Records in 1996. By 1997, the company's revenue was estimated to be $130 million annually. However, by the turn of the century Platinum had begun to lose money--its first quarter financial report in 2000 showed that the company had lost $3.9 million in the quarter and had just $3,000 in cash.

Under the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea, five nations have the legal right to exploit the Arctic‚Äôs natural resources within their exclusive economic zones: Canada, Russia, Denmark, Norway, and the United States (though the U.S. has yet to ratify the treaty, it considers the treaty to be customary international law and abides by it). The Arctic region and its resources have recently been at the center of controversy and pose potential conflicts between nations that have differing opinions of how to manage the area, including conflicting territorial claims. In addition, the Arctic region is home to an estimated 400,000 indigenous people. If the ice continues to melt at the current rate, then these indigenous people are at risk of being displaced. The acceleration of ice depletion will contribute to climate change as a whole: melting ice releases methane, ice reflects incoming solar radiation, and without it will cause the ocean to absorb more radiation (albedo effect), heating up the water causing more ocean acidification, and melting ice will cause a rise in sea level. Source: U.S. Geological Survey Background The Arctic consists of multiple sub-regions: Russian Arctic, Canadian Arctic, Greenland (Kalaallit Nunaat), Northern Alaska (USA), Svalbard (Norway), Iceland, Fennoscandia. In addition to these sub-regions, the Arctic Ocean and its multiple seas‚ÄîGreenland Sea, Barents Sea, Kara Sea, Laptev Sea, East Siberian Sea, Chuckchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, etc.-- make the arctic a vast region with a variety of natural resources.  Resources   Oil and gas  The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that undiscovered oil and gas reserves in the Arctic amount to 22% of the world's total, about 412 billion barrels of oil.Andrew Osborn, Putin's Russia in biggest Arctic military push since Soviet fall, Reuters (January 31, 2017). A Brookings Institution summary reported: The first offshore oil platform in the Arctic was Prirazlomnaya in the Pechora Sea off Russia, operated by the Russian company Gazprom; it began production in late 2013. Russia jailed 30 Greenpeace activists protesting the platform and seized their ship. The largest Arctic platform in the Arctic is Goliat in the Barents Sea off Norway, co-owned by Eni Norge AS and Statoil; it began production in 2015. Royal Dutch Shell had $7 billion project to extract oil from the Chukchi Sea off Alaska, Polar Pioneer, but abandoned the project in 2015 after determining that it was \\"not sufficient to warrant further exploration\\".Jennifer A. Dlouhy, Shell abandons Arctic oil quest after $7 billion bid yields 'disappointing' results, Fuel Fix/Houston Chronicle (September 28, 2015). Contributing to these decision was the record-low price of oil and the high operating costs of operating in a remote region with extreme weather. Arctic oil production is costly; in October 2015, the break- even point (price required to cover the cost of production) of known but undeveloped Arctic oil reservoirs was $78.6 per barrel; this was more expensive to produce than all other forms of oil except for oil sands.  Minerals  The Arctic has vast deposits of economically valuable mineral resources. Significant deposits of phosphate, bauxite, diamonds, iron ore, and gold are located in the Arctic region.Joel K. Bourne, Jr., In the Arctic's Cold Rush, There Are No Easy Profits, National Geographic (March 2016). Deposits of silver, copper, and zinc also exist in the Arctic.Isaac Arnsdorf, Diamonds to Oil Bring Gold Rush Dreams to Melting Arctic, Bloomberg (April 30, 2014). Resource extraction is extremely difficult, however. In Greenland, retreating ice caps revealed deposits of rare-earth metals and other minerals, sparking a race between Europe and China over access to this resource.Elisabeth Rosenthal, Race Is On as Ice Melt Reveals Arctic Treasures, New York Times (September 18, 2012). While in 2012 Greenland had only one operating mine, more than a hundred new sites were being planned. The Barentsburg coal mine on the Norwegian island of Svalbard is open, but has operated at a loss for many years.  Fish  Emerging fisheries are another resource in the Artic.Deb Riechmann, U.S. lags behind arctic nations in race to stake claims to untapped resources, Associated Press (January 1, 2014). Many marine species have traditional cultural value to Alaska Natives; these marine species are being threatened by climate change.Thorsteinson, L. K., and Love, M. S., eds., 2016, Alaska Arctic marine fish ecology catalog: U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Report 2016-5038 (OCS Study, BOEM 2016-048), 768 p., doi:10.3133/sir20165038. In 2015, the five nations with waters adjacent to the central Arctic High Seas agreed upon \\"interim measures on control of commercial fishing\\" in the central Arctic High Seas. A December 2015 meeting of these states, plus an additional five cooperating nations, \\"reaffirmed that, although commercial fishing in the high seas area of the central Arctic Ocean appears unlikely to occur in the near future, the state of currently available scientific information needs to be improved in order to reduce the substantial uncertainties associated with Arctic fish stocks.\\"Fourth Meeting of Scientific Experts on Fish Stocks in the Central Arctic Ocean, 4th FiSCAO, Alaska Fisheries Science Center, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In April 2016, representatives of the nations again met to negotiate and discuss commercial fishing in the Arctic high seas.Hannah Hoag, Nations negotiate fishing in Arctic high seas, Arctic Deeply (republished by United Press International (April 28, 2016). Bioprospecting By 2009, more than 40 companies were engaging in bioprospecting in the Arctic.Hannah Hoag, The cold rush, Nature Biotechnology 27, 690‚Äì692 (2009), doi:10.1038/nbt0809-690.  Trade routes  Trade routes in the Arctic are debatably one of the most valuable resources. Currently, three shipping passage are in operation: the Northeast Passage (NEP), the Northwest Passage (NWP), and the Transpolar Passage (TPP). While these passages are currently in use, other passages that previously were inaccessible are now becoming accessible due to climate change and sea ice melting. The Arctic Ocean fosters shorter trade routes between 80 percent of the most industrialized nations. The consequences of these shorter trade routes are less fuel consumption, less carbon emissions and faster transportation of goods.  Undiscovered resources  The U.S. Geological Survey conducted research on the undiscovered resources north of the Arctic Circle. The research revealed that a least 50 million barrels of natural gas and oil have accumulation underneath the arctic seabed.Bird, Kenneth J., Charpentier, Ronald R., Gautier, Donald L., Houseknecht, David W., Klett, Timothy R., Pitman, Janet K., Moore, Thomas E., Schenk, Christopher J., Tennyson, Marilyn E. and Wandrey, Craig J., 2008, Circum-Arctic resource appraisal; estimates of undiscovered oil and gas north of the Arctic Circle: U.S. Geological Survey Fact Sheet 2008-3049, 4 p. .  Tourism   Stakeholders  Under UNCLOS, five nations have exclusive economic zones (EEZs) in the Arctic region. These nations have the legal right to exploit the resources within their EEZs.  Russia  In August 2007, in an \\"openly choreographed publicity stunt\\" extensively covered by Russian state-controlled television, two Russian submersibles in the Arktika 2007 expedition planted a Russian flag at the bottom of the North Pole, in a bid to symbolically bolster Russia's disputed claim to \\"nearly half of the floor of the Arctic Ocean and potential oil or other resources there\\". However, no other Arctic nations recognized this stunt to be of legal significance. In 1915, Russia became the first nation to drill in the Arctic and has continued to drill in the region since. Since oil and natural gas account for a large portion of Russia's federal budget revenue and exports, Russia has been very interested in extracting these resources from the region. Russia's share of the oil reserves in the Arctic Ocean has been estimated to account for half of the undiscovered oil in the region. Furthermore, 20% of Russia‚Äôs GDP is generated in the Arctic. Russia has also significantly increased its military presence in the Arctic region, creating tension amongst nations. Russia currently has 40 icebreakers (ships that are able to break through ice), making it the world leader in icebreakers.  Canada  On December 20, 2016, U.S. President Barack Obama and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued a joint statement indefinitely banning drilling in the Arctic, which will be reviewed every five years based on a climate and marine science life cycle assessment. This ban encompasses most of the U.S. waters and all of the Canadian waters in the Arctic. Canada current has a fleet of 15 icebreakers.  The Kingdom of Denmark  The Kingdom of Denmark has expressed interest in resource exploitation, but has stressed the need to do so in a manner that respects the Arctic's nature and environment. In its Arctic strategy report, Denmark acknowledged the importance of practicing the \\"highest international standards of safety, health, environment, preparedness and response\\" when extracting resources in the region. The report also included the nation's intent to \\"seize the many opportunities in the Arctic to create more growth and development\\" and acknowledged that it needed to realize the region's economic potential.Kingdom of Denmark Strategy for the Arctic 2011‚Äì2020. Denmark has four icebreakers.  Norway  Norway has a history of Arctic drilling, and continues to express interest in it. Drilling in the Norwegian Continental Shelf began in 1966 and has continued to be a huge part of Norway's economic growth. Over the years since drilling began in the region, the industry has created values in excess of NOK 12,000 billion, and in 2012 alone, the petroleum sector accounted for 23 percent of value creation in the country. A BP report declared Norway to be the seventh largest natural gas producer in the world in 2015. It has also been projected that Norwegian gas production will increase substantially in the near future. Norway has also taken advantage of the Arctic tourism opportunities that have just recently been made possible. There are currently many Arctic cruise options to choose from, including one to the North Pole. Norway has two icebreakers.  United States  In November 2016, citing the need for environmental protection, the U.S. Department of the Interior instituted a ban on drilling in the Beaufort Sea and Chukchi Sea of the Arctic between 2017 and 2022.Chris D'Angelo, Trump Reportedly Prepping Order To Reverse Arctic Drilling Ban, Huffington Post (April 7, 2016). One month later, in a joint statement with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, President Barack Obama used his authority under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 to extend the protections permanently.Robinson Meyer, Can Trump Reverse Obama's Arctic-Drilling Ban? Probably not, at least without Congress‚Äôs help., The Atlantic (December 21, 2016). It is unclear where the U.S. stands on Arctic resource exploitation under the administration of Donald Trump, who took office in January 2017. During his presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly denied climate change, called for an energy policy focused on fossil fuels, and pledged to repeal environmental regulations.Ashley Parker & Coral Davenport, Donald Trump's Energy Plan: More Fossil Fuels and Fewer Rules, New York Times (May 26, 2016). In April 2017, it was reported that Trump was preparing an order to reverse the U.S.'s Arctic drilling ban. It is not entirely clear whether Trump has the authority to unilaterally withdrawal the outer continental shelf protection; most legal experts believe that the protection may only be withdrawn by an act of Congress. Adding to the uncertainty of this issue is the fact that under this new administration, U.S. Secretary of State and former CEO of Exxon Mobil, Rex Tillerson, was on the U.S. Chairmanship of the Arctic Council. The United States currently has two icebreakers.  Indigenous people  There are approximately 4 million people living in the Arctic, 10% of which are indigenous peoples. Indigenous people have permanent representation in the Arctic Council.https://www.un.org/en/events/indigenousday/pdf/Indigenous_Arctic_Eng.pdf Although most indigenous communities fear resource exploitation will lead to negative environmental impacts that will negatively affect their well being, some see it as an important economic opportunity for those who are struggling to adapt to changes in the regional climate.  Other nations  As the Arctic's many resources become more available for exploitation, other nations with no legal exploitation rights are trying to stake a claim in the resource race. Many have argued that the Arctic region is a \\"global commons\\" and cannot be governed by a few countries. Particularly, non-Arctic nations are concerned with the effects that changes in the Arctic climate will have on global climate change. In terms of environmental degradation, the negative effects of resource extraction in the Arctic region are not limited to the borders of the countries in which they originated. For example, melting polar ice caps contribute to sea level rise, which threaten coastal regions and low-lying countries such as Bangladesh and the Netherlands. The climatic changes in the Arctic region have significant impacts on the rest of the world, as \\"northern ecosystems are increasingly linked to the rest of the globe through myriad physical, biological, cultural, and economic ties.\\" China has argued for governance rights in the region, arguing that it is a \\"near Arctic\\" country and is affected by the climate effects of the region. China was granted observer status in the Arctic Council in 2013. In 2016, China indicated that it planned to ship cargo through the Northwest Passage, setting up a conflict with Canada, which asserts sovereignty over the area.Nash Jenkins, China Could Be Preparing to Challenge Canada's Sovereignty Over the Northwest Passage, Time (April 21, 2016). In addition to China, 11 other non-Arctic nations have observer status in the Arctic Council: France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, United Kingdom, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and India.  Impacts on indigenous communities  Accelerated climate change in the Arctic- as a direct result from resource exploitation and increased anthropogenic activity in the region- will drastically alter the livelihoods of indigenous people in this Arctic. Indigenous people depend heavily on the natural environment for necessities such as hunting, harvesting, fishing, and herding. Melting sea ice and extreme weather patterns threaten the animals that survive off the established conditions and thus threaten the people that depend on such animals for food. Changes in this natural environment will have impacts on their economy, society, culture and health. Indigenous people have listed contaminants, land use, climate, security and access as their main points of concerns. Historically, many indigenous communities believe that their \\"land has been expropriated and resources exploited without due regard to indigenous peoples\\". However, indigenous people have recently had their political organizations recognized by international communities and the human rights of indigenous people have solidified in those communities as well.  Alaska  In 2003 it was identified by the Army Corps of Engineers that four Alaskan villages would need to relocate because of risk of flooding and erosion. More villages have been added to that list from the time frame between 2003 and 2016. One of these villages, Shishmaref, number 650 people and they are at risk of becoming the first American community climate refugees. However, relocation is proving difficult because there is no governmental institutional framework that exists for the aid of climate refugees in the United States. the Obama administration promised to fund $50.4 billion to help with relocation efforts in 2016.  Sami people  The Sami people live primarily in north Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Russia and have survived for generations fishing and hunting. The changes in climate has caused unpredictable conditions in the ice, which the Sami people have come to rely on and predict so that they and their herds can move across it. In one instance, 300 of their reindeer sank in the ice and drowned. Land grabs by the Swedish government are also prevalent and lacks in communication between them and the Sami people.  Displacement  Increased anthropogenic activity in the Arctic region, attributed to the resource race, has contributed to the threat of indigenous displacement: as the climate changes in the region, local animals‚Äô normal patterns are disrupted, affecting the communities‚Äô food supplies; melting permafrost and erosion has damaged local infrastructure, including homes, buildings, sewage systems, etc.; unstable and unpredictable ice patterns have affected mobility vital for transportation, hunting, travel, and communication. Furthermore, the changes and variability in the climate have left indigenous communities who rely on traditional knowledge vulnerable and essentially \\"strip arctic residents of their considerable knowledge, predictive ability, and self-confidence in making a living from their resources.\\" Environmental degradation  It has been argued that Arctic trade routes will decrease global greenhouse gas emissions from shipping because these routes would be much shorter than the current routes. However, it is important to note that increased shipping in the region will contribute to Arctic environmental degradation and will severely impact indigenous communities. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, ‚ÄúPotential impacts from shipping include: the release of oil through accidental or illegal discharge, ship strikes on marine mammals, the introduction of alien species, disruption of migratory patterns of marine mammals, increased anthropogenic noise and increased atmospheric emissions.‚Äù Additionally, marine vessels are a large source of greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions, which impact local air quality and human health. Offshore drilling in the Arctic also poses huge threats to the regional ecosystem and indigenous communities. Pollution from the offshore drilling industry can damage marine animals and disrupt their migratory patterns, destroy flora and fauna, and interfere with subsistence lifestyles of indigenous communities. There have already been several cases in which it was determined that anthropogenic activity in the Arctic region resulted in environmental damage. In 2013, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency fined Shell $1.1 million for air quality violations on several offshore drilling vessels in the Arctic.  Economic implications  While some indigenous communities believe that the resource race will provide economic opportunity, others are skeptical of how much it will actually benefit them economically. In the past, economic benefits of resource extraction in the Arctic has created revenue for governments and private entities, while relatively little if any of its wealth was directly returned to improve the economic and social well-being of the local people in the regions where extraction occurred.  Food security  The changing climate in the Arctic is affecting food security in indigenous communities. When the ice is unsuitable to travel on, it is impossible to hunt for food. Additionally, food security is vulnerable to climate change because the food supply consists of local species that are themselves sensitive to climatic changes. There is also concern over the toxins found in local species and the risk of oil contamination in indigenous communities' food supplies.  Climate change and the Arctic  Climate change has a worldwide effect, but many studies show that warmer trends are more intense in higher latitudes.Houghton, J.T., Ding, Y., Griggs, D.J., Noguer, M., Van Der Linden, P.J., Dai, X., Maskell, K., And Johnson, C.A. 2001. Climate change 2001: The scientific basis. Contribution of Working Group 1 to the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. 881 p. Since the Arctic resides in a higher latitude, its communities are more vulnerable. Thus far, average temperatures have risen almost twice as fast as in the rest of the world. Records show changes in various parts of the biophysical environment of the Arctic, such as sea-ice extent, area of permafrost and depth, river hydrology, geophysical processes, and the distribution of marine and terrestrial species of the Arctic. The warming of the earth‚Äôs atmosphere and surface is mainly attributed to the greenhouse effect. The gases that have a role in the greenhouse effect are mainly carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).Wang, W-C., Wobbles, D. J., Washington, W. M., Isaacs, R. G., and Molnar, G. (1986). Trace gases and other potential perturbations to global climate. Rev. Geophys. 24, 110-140. Even though carbon dioxide is the abundant greenhouse gas, these other gases actually absorb radiation more efficiently and persist in the atmosphere longer than carbon dioxide, so their warming effects increase with time.Etkin, D.A. (1990b). Equivalency of greenhouse gases. Carbon Dioxide/Climate Rep. 90-01, 5-6. Atmospheric Environment Service, Canadian Climate Centre, Downsview, Ontario. Climate change is making Arctic resources more accessible. For example, in Denmark the retreating of the ice caps has exposed mineral deposits, such as rare-earth metals, that can be extracted and used for technologies like cell phones or military guidance systems. Another effect of climate change on the Arctic will include the creation of new trade waterways through the north, further exploiting the area. Changes in the Arctic will affect resource competition and conflict in the upcoming years. Changes in the Arctic will have worldwide impacts. The Arctic basin is an ice-covered ocean that has strong feedback effects on many parts of the climate system. Since the arctic regulates heat exchange between the ocean and atmosphere, the sea ice decline is expected to affect atmospheric circulation and weather patterns. Other effects can also include diminished rainfall in many parts of the world, leading to desertification in many areas and a decline in their ability to sustain agriculture. These changes indirectly create more conflict in water scarcity and will increase migration of communities. More direct effects of the degradation of the Arctic include significant rise in global sea levels, which will displace low coastal areas around the world and result in loss of agricultural lands.

After the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released new health advisories in March 2016, there was concern over health risks of the levels of PFOA and PFOS present. The responses of different government officials, agencies, and companies raise questions as to whether or not there was any environmental injustice involved.  History  In late 2013, the US Geological Survey and the Environmental Protection Agency studied samples from untreated and treated water from the United States' utilities, where researchers had found traces of chemicals in the water of areas including Lawrence County and Morgan County, Alabama. Although there is minimal information on the long-term effects of the contaminated water, researchers discovered that a fluorinated compound called Perfluorooctanoic acid was in the water sample. This chemical compound has been linked to many other health problems, such as thyroid disease, kidney cancer, and pregnancy-induced hypertension. Many Alabama residents have been suffering from contaminated water that can cause cancer, congenital disabilities for women of childbearing age, and developmental problems for children. EPA health advisories released on May 19, 2016 prompted government officials to recommend that residents in both Lawrence County and Morgan County avoid drinking the water. After testing the citizens' blood concentration level, the EPA revealed that Lawrence and Morgan Counties had water that was contaminated with water pollutants introduced into the rivers and drinking system. The residents have been advised not to use tap water because scientists have found traces of Perfluorooctanoic acid(PFOA) and Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid(PFOS) in the water source. The two primary pollutants, PFOS and PFOA, are known to be toxic substances that have been linked to causing certain types of cancers and other health symptoms. Companies in the area, such as 3M, Daikin, and its subsidiary Dyneon LLC, have been identified as the likely source of the introduction of pollutants in the water system. There has been much controversy between government officials of varying levels as some question whether or not the alleged water pollution exists or if the numbers are not a concern. As a result, EPA advised the citizens in the counties to refrain from ingesting the water until further studies are done regarding the issue.U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Perfluorochemical (PFC) Contamination Near Decatur, AL. United States Environmental Protection Agency. 2013. Web. On August 6, 2016, the West Morgan-East Lawrence Water Authority released a statement saying that new tests of the water returned a value of 14 parts per trillion, which is below the EPA health advisory level. However, officials of the water authority are still slightly concerned and continue to push for an activated carbon filter.  Health impacts of PFOA and PFOS   Effects of PFOA  Perfluorooctanic acid (PFOA) is commonly used as a degradation product with other perfluorinated compounds. PFOA is also used in the production of Teflon, also known as polytetrafluoroethylene, which is often used as a non-stick surface of many cooking items. The chemical often occurs in water systems in industrialized countries. Based on various animal data analysis, the compound has toxic effects on the immune system, the endocrine systems, and may also cause tumors. Major manufacturers tried to limit the use of Perfluorooctanoic acid since it's been revealed that water resources have been contaminated with this compound, including industrial sites, municipal waste sites, and industrial wastes. Children exposed to this chemical are at an increased risk of developing thyroid diseases. When the thyroid gland is affected, it can impact other body parts within the human body which can lead to other health symptoms such as growth development. Although the chemical is not visible, the chemical can enter a body's bloodstream if the person consumes the polluted water. Also, humans as well as other living species that consume the contaminated water are at a higher risk of contracting various health problems. The chemical is used in a variety of consumer products such as clothing, food packages, and furniture. According to scientific studies, the leading cause for the introduction of the chemicals in various drinking water sources is due to contamination from nearby industrial plants.  Effects of PFOS  Perfluorooctane Sulfonate acid (PFOS) is a known global pollutant that is considered toxic to the environment. Although the contaminant is existent in the environment, there is limited information on the effect that Perfluorooctane Sulfonate acid (PFOS) has on the human body. In relations, scientists are still not certain about the long-term health effects that Perfluorooctane Sulfonate acid (PFOS) has on water and food. According to epidemiological studies, exposure to the substance will lead to adverse effects including defects during fetal development, tissue damage, and thyroid damage. Communities that are located nearby these factory plants have likely consumed the contaminated water, exposing residents to these harmful compounds. To reduce the exposure of the chemicals, public health officials suggest that water systems be carefully monitored and managed with a filtered water system. Further studies need to be done to understand the relationship between the two chemicals and the general population. In order to know the long-term effects of Perfluorooctanoic acid and Perfluorooctane Sulfonate acid has on the human body, researchers must examine the origins of each water source and the nearby communities.  EPA regulations  On March 19, 2016, the EPA posted health advisories about the two chemicals PFOA and PFOS. According to the new health advisories, a combined level of 70 parts per trillion for both PFOA and PFOS is said to be hazardous and has the potential to impact health negatively.United States.

In 2009, a level of 0.04 parts per billion of PFOA and PFOS was considered to be a potential hazard for drinking water by the EPA.United States. Environmental Protection Agency. Office of Water. Provisional Health Advisories for Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) and Perfluorooctane Sulfonate (PFOS). N.p., 8 Jan. 2009. Web. In 2012, the EPA passed the Third Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR 3). The UCMR was initiated as a result of the Safe Drinking Water Act, as changes in 1996 required the EPA to provide a list of unregulated water contaminants that should begin to be monitored. PFOA and PFOS were both listed in the UCMR 3, making public water systems in the United States to have to begin testing the chemical levels of PFOA and PFOS alongside with the other chemicals listed.United States. Environmental Protection Agency. Office of Water. The Third Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR 3). N.p., 2 May 2012. Web. While the new health advisories have been released by the EPA in 2016, there are currently no enforceable standards regarding national regulations.United States. Environmental Protection Agency. FACT SHEET PFOA & PFOS Drinking Water Health Advisories. US EPA, May 2016. Web. As stated by the EPA, health advisories are mainly intended to give information about the chemicals in question and allow further research to take place before more action is taken. In February 2017, the Trump administration reportedly began looking into shutting down the Office of Enforcement & Compliance Assurance (OECA), which is a division of the EPA that works to enforce multiple federal laws including the Safe Drinking Water Act. On March 8, 2017, New York senators drafted new legislation that would require the EPA to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act and have it set more strict levels for compounds such as PFOA and PFOS. The senators and its supporters hope that it will pass through the Senate and that the Trump Administration will approve of it. In the House of Representatives, several legislators are also pushing for the military to be responsible for cleaning up some PFOA and PFOS pollution from various military locations across the nation. Despite the proposed budget cuts to the EPA by the Trump administration, PFOA and PFOS research is still being done by the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program and the Environmental Security Technology Certification Program, programs funded by the Department of Defense.  Impacts on residents  The toxic substances had contaminated the drinking water of nearby counties. After collecting various blood samples from Morgan County and Lawrence County, the state of Alabama was under investigation for water contamination. Although the levels of PFOA and PFOS were found in low concentrations, warnings were released indicating that prolonged exposure to these pollutants can cause serious health problems. In order to remove these pollutants from drinking water, the EPA recommends that unconventional methods such as Activated carbon filtering or high-pressure membrane filtering must be used, demonstrating the extra precautions residents must take. The investigation explained how individuals went through a similar problem with water contamination in the past, yet there were still no signs of long-term health effects regarding the contaminated water. The recommendation of installing an activated carbon filter or a high pressure membrane filter as a method to get rid of the PFOA/PFOS pollution in the water are not commonly used methods to treat water. A proposed $4 million activated carbon filtration system by the water authority would be a temporary solution until a larger reverse osmosis treatment plant could be built. In addition, citizens are also concern over the cost and the lack of access to resources and the proposed solution. Due to differing responses from government officials and water authority officials and lack of expertise regarding PFOA/PFOS pollution, there is confusion among citizens regarding what is the best course of action.  Lawrence County  Lawrence County, Alabama, a county in North Alabama was affected by the release of PFOA and PFOS into their main source of water. Although the Water and Sewer Authority affected belongs to East Lawrence and West Morgan counties, the West Lawrence Water Co-op also uses water from the authority's system. Because of this, all of Lawrence county has been affected by the contamination in drinking water. There is a diverse background of those affected by the water contamination. The percentage of people whose race was white alone in Alabama in 2015 was 77.1%, whereas the percentage in Lawrence County, Alabama was 78.2%. Lawrence County was 11.2% Black or African-American alone, 5.8% Native American, 2.2% Hispanic or Latino alone, and 0.2% Asian alone in 2015. The entire state of Alabama was 13.3% Black or African American alone, 1.2% Native American, 17.6% Hispanic or Latino alone, and 5.6% Asian alone. The median income for Lawrence County in 2015 was $40,003, and the persons in poverty were 18.7%. The median income of Alabama in 2015 was $53, 889, and the person in poverty were 13.5%.  Morgan County  Morgan County, Alabama, is another Northern Alabama County affected by PFOA and PFOS pollution in the drinking water. The West Morgan-East Lawrence Water Authority, which services parts of both Morgan and Lawrence counties, was one of the main water facilities cited as potentially having a water pollution issue. The manufacturing company 3M is believed to have contributed to the pollution as a result of activity at a Decatur, a city in Morgan County, manufacturing plant. According to 2015 data, the annual income for Morgan households was $45,751 compared to $53,889 for the state of Alabama. In Morgan, 16.1% of individuals are below the poverty level compared to 13.5% of individuals in the state.  Environmental groups  Since the EPA health advisory, two environmental groups have been working with citizens of both Lawrence and Morgan to help resolve the pollution issue. The group Tennessee Riverkeeper filed a lawsuit on February 15, 2017, against the company 3M, seeking to make 3M among other groups responsible for the clean-up and resolution of the PFOA and PFOS pollution. The group New York Environmental Law & Justice Project is currently working with Lawrence and Morgan community groups to raise public knowledge of the issue and work towards a resolution, potentially through legal action.  State Government and policy response  If water systems are not properly monitored, PFOA and PFOS from nearby industrial sites that use or manufacture the chemicals can spread into the water. Due to the state's budget cut, the amount of funding has declined over the years, and thus there is not enough financial support to enable strict water inspections in the area. The water division stated their intent to try running an environmental program that will enforce better water plans. In the meantime, the West Morgan East Lawrence Water and Sewer Authority is currently working on a new and improved filtration system, which is set to be finished in 2019. According to the Alabama state Governor Robert Bentley, the water issues that predominated in Lawrence and Morgan Counties were nothing to worry about. Companies had warned neighboring communities their history of releasing chemicals into the local water system, and the EPA released a statement warning people about the tested, unsafe level of pollutants in the water. Despite these warnings, Governor Robert Bentley still refused to acknowledge the problem. However, some of the residents in these counties are scared and will continue to avoid the water since there could very well be a health risk involved. The contamination of the water has taken an emotional toll on some of the residents in the area, explaining how companies that moved into the area have been ruining their neighborhood. There are inconsistent responses from both the government and the water department. The general manager of the water department, Don Sims, released a statement regarding the dangers of the water and warned citizens to avoid drinking it; however, Sims was criticized by the EPA and government officials for releasing the statement. As a result of miscommunication and a lack of definitive answers from officials, citizens of both Lawrence and Morgan are unsure of what the best solution to this pollution issue.  Companies' responses   3M water contamination lawsuit  The 3M manufacturing company, located in Decatur, was shown to be the major producer of both PFOS and PFOA. The 3M company facility was located nearby the Alabama water source; therefore, there were signs that the water source has been exposed to the two toxic chemicals. Furthermore, the West Morgan-East Lawrence water system receives its main water from up north by the Tennessee River. The lawsuit claims that more than four water systems were affected specifically by 3M activity, while the 3M side claims that those allegations are not based on fact. For example, the runoff from the landfills had entered many nearby rivers; thus citizens are exposed to the chemicals. 3M has responded to the water contamination as harmless to the human body since those materials are commonly found in people. Although many individuals have filed complaints regarding the issue, 3M stated how: In 2002, 3M had voluntarily phased out production of the chemicals due to the various lawsuit from other companies. Also, the EPA had suggested an alternative plan for the water contamination thus they suggest the state to replace the water system with a carbon filter within the water system. Following the new EPA health advisory from March 2016, the West Morgan East Lawrence Water Authority filed a lawsuit against 3M, arguing that the company is at fault for the pollution and potential health risks. Representatives of 3M believe that the company has done its part to work with agencies such as the EPA to handle the situation and thus think the suit is unwarranted. Along with 3M Co, Daikin and its subsidiary Dyneon LLC got sued for its water contamination in the Tennessee River. According to the West Morgan-East Lawrence Water and Sewer Authority, Daikin settled its portion of the lawsuit by paying $5 million involving with the water contamination containing PFOA and PFOS. The settlement consisted of $3.9 million going into the water's authority's temporary filtration system and $450,000 will be divided amongst the water systems in the state. In relations to the settlement, Daikin admitted that they did no wrong in the disposal of the chemicals and customers are reimbursed for their water bills during the \\"do-not-drink warning\\" period. Although the lawsuit has been ongoing for a while, the EPA issued a health advisory on May 19, 2016, to advised women of childbearing age to not use the drinking water.  Related incidences   Decatur, Alabama  The high levels of PFOA and PFOS detected in 2016 was not the first incident of PFOA and PFOS pollution in the area. In 2007, the EPA decided to test the water in Decatur, Alabama, a part of Morgan County, due to industrial activity linked to the production of PFOA and PFOS of the companies 3M, Daikin America, and Toray Carbon Fibers America.\\"Perfluorochemical (PFC) Contamination Near Decatur, AL.\\" U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Perfluorochemical (PFC) Contamination Near Decatur, AL  US EPA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT (2013): n. pag. EPA Archive. Web. The levels of PFOS and PFOA in the West Morgan-East Lawrence water system was determined to be below the current EPA acceptable levels (which were 0.4 parts per billion for PFOA and 0.2 parts per billion for PFOS). Despite the tests showing the water was safe, blood tests revealed that residents in Decatur had slightly elevated blood serum levels of PFOA and PFOS, which is something the EPA wanted to monitor.  Parkersburg, West Virginia  Parkersburg is on average a low-income community, with a median household income of $31,876 compared to $41,751 for the state of West Virginia. Parkersburg is also more impoverished compared to the state, with 24.3% of Parkersburg residents being below the poverty line compared to 18.0% for the state. In 2004, blood tests revealed higher than average concentrations of PFOA in blood serum in residents of Parkersburg, West Virginia. A DuPont Teflon producing plant operated near Parkersburg, and that plant has been identified as the likely source. It was discovered that the DuPont plant had contaminated the local water supply with perfluorooctanoic (PFOA) acid thus residents in the area are advised to drink filtered water for the time being. For decades, studies have suggested that PFOA has been linked to many drinking water supplies and other fluorochemical-containing consumer products which can cause health problems.  Hoosick Falls, New York  Hoosick Falls is a low-income community based on census data, with the median household income being $52,045 and that of the state of New York being $59,269. That being said, Hoosick Falls has a lower percentage of individuals that live below the poverty level compared to the state as a whole, with 10.9% of Hoosick Falls residents being in poverty and 15.7% of the state's residents. Hoosick Falls is a town located in New York where half of the population was seen to be exposed to water contamination. In January 2016, the EPA recommended that residents of Hoosick Falls use bottled water after finding traces of PFOA in the water supplies. The pollution was discovered in both public and private water supplies, and it is believed that facilities of the companies Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics and Honeywell International are the sources. The two companies were held responsible for the exposure of PFOA, thus they offered a settlement of over $1 million to cover the cost of the water contamination. While the settlement is still ongoing, a municipal activated-carbon filtration system has been installed and can be used by owners of private wells, but government officials still call upon the companies to pay for cleaning up the pollution and provided Hoosick Falls residents with clean drinking water.  North Bennington, Vermont  With a median household income of $47,228 compared to $55,176 for the state, North Bennington is considered a low-income community of Vermont. A higher percentage of North Bennington residents are in poverty when compared to the state of Vermont as a whole, as 16.9% of North Bennington residents live below the poverty line compared to 11.5% of the state. Following the discovery of PFOA pollution in nearby Hoosick Falls, New York, the village of North Bennington, Vermont, found varying levels of PFOA contamination in the water supply and multiple private wells. Facilities of the company Chemfab have been identified as the likely sources, and the Vermont Department of Health has offered blood tests for North Bennington residents since the levels of PFOA were higher than the department's health advisory level of 20 parts per trillion. The state and multiple agencies are continuing to look into the matter and determine the best course of action for the residents living in these communities.  New Jersey public water systems  In 2006, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection conducted a study to see if there were PFOA and PFOS contamination in the state's public water systems.New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. Division of Water Supply & Geoscience.Occurrence of Perfluorinated Chemicals in Untreated New Jersey Drinking Water Sources. N.p.: n.p., 2014. Print. The researchers chose to only include water systems that were near facilities that either produced or used PFOA and PFOS. Of the 23 systems tested, 65% contained PFOA and 30% contained PFOS. In September 2016, PFOA and PFOS contaminants were detected in the waters of Merrimack County. Merrimack County is on average a low-income community with a median household income of $65,983 compared to $72,093 for the state. Starting in January 2017, Ocean and Burlington's counties have called for testing for PFOA and PFOS in the water. Ocean County has a median household income of $61,994, and 11.3% of Ocean residents live below the poverty level compared to 10.8% for the state. Burlington, on the other hand, is not a low-income community with a median household income of $78,621 and 6.4% of residents living in poverty.

The common goals as Kramer and Kadi express typically revolve around environmental protection policies but is not limited to the environment exclusively. The goals can be social, political, or industrial depending on the context and framework used. As it was elaborated to earlier, these networks can cross borders and create a more connected global community as Meijer claims. Scholars have found a direct relationship between connected cities and the policies they choose to implement on a micro, meso and macro scale. With globalization has come the increased interconnectedness of world cities. With this interconnectedness, Romolini and Grove argue, creates more dynamic and well-rounded policies hitting the forefront of everyday life. They can be flexible as well as adaptive to changing contemporary issues allowing the participants in the network greater output from the given policy. The synergy created through these networks allows domestic based enterprises, which can include but are not limited to international airports, big business centers, cultural centers, as well as tourist areas to form, as Hall and Pain state in their book The Polycentric Metropolis: Learning from Mega-city Regions in Europe. The following subsections will bring insight into what scholars are currently finding in regards to polycentric networks. These include the European context, the American context, the rural and urban context, micro/macro/meso levels of polycentric networks, polycentric networks in metropolitan areas and the potential future for polycentric networks in the growing globalized word. As well, other scholarly work on dynamic polycentric networks, ones where change is constantly happening, will be introduced through contemporary examples.  European context  In the European context, it is also apparent that cities fairly close to one another, in different countries such as the so-called ‚ÄúPentagon‚Äù cities, which comprise Birmingham, Paris, Milan, Hamburg and Amsterdam. These countries have expanded in such a way with globalization that they are more connected through the information that each nation is sharing with one another. This close proximity has led to the European Union Ministers of planning to propose a ‚Äúcentral policy objective of polycentrism‚Äù in Potsdam, 1999. It is apparent that polycentric networks, in today's age, typically work to coordinate services between cities and nations due to service policies directly affecting a city's economic in and output. Four distinct areas of services have been identified to be core features of policy, including: ‚ÄúFinance and Business services: including banking and insurance, commercial business services such as law, accountancy, advertising and public relations, and design services including architecture, civil engineering, industrial design and fashion Power and influence (or command and control): National government, supra-national organizations like United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) or the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and headquarters of major organizations including transnational corporations Creative and Cultural industries: Including live performing arts (theatre, opera, ballet, concerts), museums and galleries and exhibitions, print and electronic media Tourism: Including both business and leisure tourism and embracing hotels, restaurants, bars, entertainment, and transportation services.‚Äù. The European context of polycentric networks can be seen in relation to transportation services offered throughout Europe. As Kathy Pain et al. explains in The Polycentric Metropolis it is clear that polycentric networks rule the European context. In their analysis of transportation routes, it is clear that more connected cities see the greater amount of flights to and from. The same can be said about rail transportation as well. Due to Europe being a fairly small land mass, travel is expedite from one end to the next, so many travelers simply take direct routes to their destination rather than non-direct routes. Without the connectivity of the different regions working in sync, this type of cross national border travel would not be as easy and seamless.  American context  The American context of polycentric networks is one not shrouded with international relations and services. In one study, done by the University of Vermont, linked Baltimore and Seattle‚Äôs environmental policies. The study found support for the connection that successful natural resource management efforts typically rely on high amounts of collaboration between organizational networks. This completely depends on the structure of the organizations and as the Vermont study claims, a higher amount of synergy can be made through organizations working together, but there is still a lack of research on the impact these efforts have on social and ecological outcomes both spatially and temporarily. In the study, they outline three main resources that are vital to inter- organizational networks success, these resources include;Information/knowledge, financial, and human (staff, volunteers). The study specifically looked at how these networks work and flow in the Baltimore and Seattle's context, two cities on opposite ends of the USA. The methodology behind why these two cities include that their populations are relatively similar as well as the land area each city covers being fairly similar in size. This study used snowball sampling to develop its list of organizations working with natural resource management as well the study breaks these organizations down into organizational attributes, relationships, and geographical scope of work. With data gathered the study hopes to see how things have changed in the two cities with different policies being implemented and how this ultimately affects the greater metropolitan.  Rural and urban context  Rural polycentric networks are nearly non-existent due to what polycentric networks entail. Urban polycentric networks draw heavily on economic network theories in respect to how polycentric networks should function. The assumption made is that ‚Äúindividual cities in these collections of distinct but proximally-located cities relate to each other in a synergetic way, making the whole network of cities more than the sum of its parts‚Äù. The interest in urban polycentric regions has increased dramatically in the last decade. As Meijers claims, even with the greater interest in these networks much more research is needed. \\"In the literature, polycentric urban regions are often defined as collections of historically distinct and both administratively and politically independent cities located in close proximity and well connected through infrastructure (see Kloosterman and Lambregts, 2001). However, as the literature on polycentric urban regions is still limited and therefore rather unconsolidated (Bailey and Turok, 2001), a diversity of concepts is applied, which are largely synonymous with the polycentric urban region concept used here.\\". Meijer notes that an increasing amount of interest has sparked politicians and urban planners to follow the trend, and this is apparent in the European context where they have very synergetic international cities.  Micro/Macro/Meso level polycentric networks  Polycentric networks are discussed on different spatial characteristics, reflecting a micro, meso, or macro level of polycentric networks in a given region. ‚Äú‚Äì micro level: intra-urban or intra-regional aspects within a certain city region. The emphasis at this level is ‚Äúurban functional and economic complementarities‚Äù which make ‚Äúcooperation and improved links‚Äù major engines of regional economic performance and ‚Äúpromote integrated spatial development strategies for city clusters‚Äù ‚Äì meso level: inter-metropolitan issues within a delimited area. The emphasis at this level is very similar to the micro level, but at the meso level cities begin to specialize and this leads into the macro level. ‚Äì macro level: inter- metropolitan issues on a European or global scale. At the European (macro) level polycentricity is considered to be ‚Äúa useful alternative model to enhance regional development more evenly across the European territory‚Äù‚Äù. These different levels of measure show the underlying normative dimensions of the polycentric networks which allow it to be flexible and convertible for spatial planning in complex regions and systems.  Polycentric networks in metropolitan areas  In metropolitan areas, the scale and intensity of collaboration is a key determinant of whether or not polycentric networks function properly. Metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) have given researchers a unique opportunity to study the scale and intensity of collaboration in these areas. In a study conducted by researchers from the University of Vermont as well as the University of La Verne, using a 2009 Government Accountability Office survey of all 381 MPOs, they found a direct link to the scale of the MPO and the performance seen. The study concluded that higher intensity of collaboration of MPOs across vertical as well as horizontal stakeholders generates a greater sense of good performance. The study found that MPOs who focus more on vertical collaboration (between the federal state and higher up agencies) saw a decrease in their perceived performance. The study looked at 15 indicators to determine its findings, these indicators include: condition of transportation network, mobility for disadvantaged populations, air quality, level of highway congestion, measure of public participation, extent of coordination and stakeholder involvement, satisfaction among general public, satisfaction among local stakeholders, compliance with federal and state rules, transportation systems security, transportation systems accessibility, transportation systems reliability, transportation systems safety, travel demand model accuracy and project implementation. The implications of this study have yet to be confirmed but Asim Zia et al. believes challenges will arise for nation-states once they are displaced as the central actor in the region. Once these more integrated organizations start to act for themselves, Asim Zia et al., believe we will see a new outlook on global governance.  Future for polycentric networks  The future for polycentric networks can be found in sustainability efforts seen around the globe. Perry Pei-Ju Yang conducted research in Singapore around the cities push for greater sustainability in relation to ecology. With globalization and the separation of land comes split ecosystems and habitats that get manipulated to form infrastructure, for human development. A big issue for the future of sustainability is how to minimize our environmental impact but continue to thrive as a species. In Yang‚Äôs research, they explored Singapore throughout different time periods. Starting in 1986 it is apparent that by 1994 and again to 2002 that much of the growth in Singapore revolves around areas of industrial development, even though these areas were spread out all throughout the island. Yang noted that most of this growth revolves around the mass-rapid transit (MRT) which connects areas of Island. The general shift seen in Singapore can be seen as the impact of polycentric networks throughout the island with the implementation of rezoning policies. From 1986 to 1994 a mass amount of rezoning occurred due to a change in policy which switched what desirable land use was in Singapore. The transformation that Singapore experienced can be used as a marker for future growth.

Where applicable, native rulers are also listed. For the purposes of this list, a current dependency is any entity listed on these lists of dependent territories and other entities. A dependent territory is normally a territory that does not possess full political independence or sovereignty as a sovereign state yet remains politically outside of the controlling state's integral area. This latter condition distinguishes a dependent territory from an autonomous region or administrative division, which forms an integral part of the 'parent' state. The administrators of uninhabited territories are excluded.

Early life  Hart describes how she was told she experienced \\"heteronormative sexual training from a really early age\\", through multiple intersex medical interventions. Despite giving consent as a child, she felt unaware of the lifelong implications. Hart describes how stigma \\"sets the scene\\" for such interventions, \\"There‚Äôs a fear that people will be maladjusted because their bodies are different, and that fear teamed with the ignorance of the realities of what it‚Äôs like to live as an adult with those bodies without surgery, kind of perpetuates a surgical intervention process\\". Growing up, Hart did not know that her sister, Phoebe Hart, also had androgen insensitivity syndrome.  Career  Hart is a \\"high-energy avant-garde performer\\" and multidisciplinary artist, assembling digital and analog filmmaking, music, and visual art. She is a cofounder of Venting Gallery and the Foundation for Contemporary Music and Culture http://fcmc.org.au/ in Brisbane, Queensland, and performs with bands including X-wave and the Unaustralians.

Princeton university Press] Gender in terms of the welfare state regime varies based on how a nation perceives and acts on the value of gender. Within gender and welfare state regimes there are three central perspectives. The first perspective is the liberal welfare state, which is utilized in the United Kingdom and Ireland. This regime believes in minimal government intervention and promotes privatization of the economy in order to create equality. The second perspective is the conservative welfare state that is utilized in Germany, France, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Italy. This regime revolves around traditional family values and believes the economy should be structured around status differentiating programs that are earnings related. The third perspective is the Social Democratic welfare state that is utilized in the Scandinavian countries. This regime is characterized by universalism and believes in full employment, income protection and a strongly interventionist state.[Eikemo, Terje Andreas, Claire Bambra, Ken Judge, and Kristen Ringdal. 2008. ‚ÄúWelfare state regimes and differences in self-perceived health in Europe: A multilevel analysis‚Äù. Social Science and Medicine. 66(11). 2281-2295] The three welfare state regimes highlight employment opportunity, wage gaps, and health status as differentiating factors when it comes to gender. In terms of employment opportunity, it is impacted by the feminization of poverty. This is when woman represent a disproportionate share of the poor population compared to men.[Ball, Jennifer and Lorne Tepperman. ‚ÄúThe Stacked Deck: An Introduction to Social Inequality‚Äù. Canada: Oxford University Press. 2016. p.40-42.] Varying beliefs between the three regimes on gender roles in the labor market effects the level of poverty pertaining toward sex. Wage gaps are affected by the differing beliefs on decommodification between the three welfare state regimes. The theory of decommodification looks to decommodify labor in order to substitute for wages, creating disparity between the pay of low-income earners (a category over-represented by women).[Mandel, Hadas and Michael Shalev. 2009. ‚ÄúHow Welfare States Shape the Gender Pay Gap: A Theoretical and Comparative Analysis‚Äù. Social Forces. 87(4). 1873-1911.] Lastly, health status is seen to be influenced by the promotion of gender equality. Those regimes, which believe in equality for all, were seen to have better overall health, compared to those regimes that do not promote gender equality.[Eikemo, Terje Andreas, Claire Bambra, Ken Judge, and Kristen Ringdal. 2008. ‚ÄúWelfare state regimes and differences in self-perceived health in Europe: A multilevel analysis‚Äù. Social Science and Medicine. 66(11). 2281-2295] Welfare State Regimes The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism written by sociologist Gosta Esping-Anderson, is the iconic work which developed the original opinions of different welfare state regimes among developed countries. Each has differing views on government intervention, citizen social capital, class equality, and other social factors. The three most commonly noted welfare state regimes are: Liberal welfare state The liberal welfare state is a governing regime that ensures that citizens are taken care of socially and economically. The liberal belief is to accomplish this with minimal government interference, allowing a free market economy to create equality. The liberal regime believes that the government monopolizes the market which only enhances class inequality and creates inefficiencies. Free markets, with little government interference, allows for competitive exchange which maintains equal opportunity for everyone to contribute to the economy and be successful. The government only provides the necessary support to alleviate poverty.[Esping-Anderson, G. 1990. ‚Äúintroduction‚Äù in The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism. Princeton university Press. pg. 9-10] Conservative welfare state The conservative welfare state, also known as the Christian welfare state, highlights a government regime with the least centralized system of governing. The conservative welfare state believes that decision-making should be directed by local levels rather than a centralized form of governing. The conservative regime is built on the foundation that there should be an authoritarian control which governs a hierarchy to control the market economy. This hierarchy creates different classes of people, which the conservative minded people believe creates stability. The conservative regime believes strong leadership and traditional gender and family roles are what allow a society to function smoothly.[Esping-Anderson, G. 1990. ‚Äúintroduction‚Äù in The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism. Princeton university Press. pg. 10-11] Social democratic welfare state The social democratic welfare state believes that by being a citizen of the nation, it grants access to universal services and state run benefits. The social democratic welfare state gives people more power in governance. The social democratic welfare state believes that improving social capital will mobilize power by making them less dependent on the market and employers. In order to positively create this, social democratic states believe that everyone requires social, health, and education resources to be efficient in society. By providing this to every citizen, it eliminates poverty, unemployment, and wage dependency, and in hand, creates a political unity with all citizens.[Esping-Anderson, G. 1990. ‚Äúintroduction‚Äù in The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism. Princeton university Press. pg. 11-12] Social capital Juha Kaariainen and Hekki Lehtonen comprised a study that focused on the relationship between social capital development and the welfare state. Two forms of social capital were looked at which were society-centered and institution-centered regimes. Society-centered social capital flourishes in societies with good family, community, and civic engagement values. Institution-centered social capital was thought to be formed through strong political support and public administration. All of the regimes seemed in favor of social capital. The conservative regime was more positive with the society-centered theory because they believe in bonding social capital through family and community ties. Voluntary civic engagement was seen to be most prevalent within liberal and social democratic state regimes. Universal trust was stronger in northern Europe who are considered social democratic, followed by the liberal and conservative regimes. These liberal and social democratic regime characteristics are said to be related to bridging social capital. This means that these societies value equal opportunity and social inclusion.[Kaariainen, Juha and Heikki Lehtonen. 2006. \\"The Variety of Social Capital in Welfare State Regimes-A Comparative Study of 21 Countries\\". European Studies. 8:1, 27-57. DOI: 10.1080/14616690500491399] This study helps to show that social capital is seen in all regimes. With that being said, how people are handled and what society values differs. That is why it is important to note that social capital has its strengths and weaknesses in all regimes. Employment opportunity One of the central topics which relates to gender and welfare state countries is the access which every individual has to good employment. In saying good employment, it is implied that a person has equal opportunity for quality part-time or full-time employment, with the same chance of advancing to desired positions. Each regime (liberal, conservative, and social democratic) has different views on the amount of social capital a person should possess. The liberal welfare state believes in laissez-faire attitude towards the market economy. As contemporary economist Adam Smith believed, the liberal welfare state ideologies would eliminate inequalities and privileges in regards to employment by having minimal government interference. The conservative welfare state views on job opportunity wanted government interference in order to create hierarchal powers and class differentiation. To conservatives, it was natural to have people with lower employment status than the select people who were developed to be leaders. This ideology to the conservatives improved efficiency. Lastly, social democratic welfare states go out of their way to make all citizens employed. The belief of having everyone employed is that equality would mobilize power and diminish the social issues which trouble a lot of governmental systems.[Esping-Anderson, G. 1990. ‚Äúintroduction‚Äù in The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism. Princeton university Press] In order to analyze how gender is impacted under these three regimes, a study conducted by Bartoll, Cortes, and Artazcoz was done to discover how working conditions, job satisfaction, health status, and psychological issues were impacted by different genders in part-time and full-time employment. The study used Esping-Anderson's welfare states to divide the data from different countries into the different regimes. The results yielded that there were generally more women who had part-time employment than males, and more males with full-time employment than females across most regimes. ‚ÄòThe lowest prevalence of females with part time employment was in conservative welfare state regimes, while the highest was with liberal welfare state regimes‚Äô.[Bartoll X, Cortes I, Artazcoz L. 2014. \\"Full- and part-time work: gender and welfare-type differences in European working conditions, job satisfaction, health status, and psychological issues\\". Scand J Work Environ Health 40:4, pg. 373] This makes sense due to the fact that women have little employment protection from the government in the liberal regime. In general, part-time employment was seen to be associated with poorer working conditions than people with full-time employment. Among the three welfare state regimes, the conservative welfare state countries did seem to be an outlier from the results. What was found in these associated countries was that there was a higher psychological demand for men, there were lower salaries and chance for promotion for both men and women (liberal and social democratic states had lower salaries and lower chance for promotion for women than men), women were more likely to have permanent contracts, men were more likely to be dissatisfied with their job, and the only differences with job satisfaction with the regimes were noticed with the conservative welfare state (men more satisfied than women).[Bartoll X, Cortes I, Artazcoz L. 2014. \\"Full- and part-time work: gender and welfare- type differences in European working conditions, job satisfaction, health status, and psychological issues\\". Scand J Work Environ Health 40:4, pg. 370-379] What this study shows was that women tend to make up a majority of the low-income employment across all the regimes. Although working conditions, job satisfaction, health status, and psychological issues vary with genders in each regime, the general trend is that females face a disadvantage when finding good employment. This phenomenon of having a disproportionate number of females in the lower-income bracket of the job market is called the feminization of poverty. The rates of females in poverty has become higher due to the fact that they are disadvantaged when it comes to good employment compared to men. Women also struggle with economic difficulties resulting from the high rates of abandonment, divorce, and widowhood which has been increasing in recent decades.[Ball, Jennifer and Lorne Tepperman. ‚ÄúThe Stacked Deck: An Introduction to Social Inequality‚Äù. Canada: Oxford University Press. 2016. p.40] Wage Gaps As was highlighted by Hadas Mandel and Michael Shalev in their theoretical analysis looking at how the welfare states shape the gender pay gap, the theories of decommodfication and defamilialization underline the key differences. ‚ÄòDecommodification believes in decommodifying labour in order to substitute a workers wage with direct means of income transfers, or indirectly through free or subsidized goods and services (social insurance, cash benefits, public housing, free public services). Defamilialization is the state taking action for care work in order to allow more females to be able to join the work force as opposed to tending to the family all day‚Äô.[Mandel, Hadas and Michael Shalev. 2009. ‚ÄúHow Welfare States Shape the Gender Pay Gap: A Theoretical and Comparative Analysis‚Äù. Social Forces. 87(4). 1877-1879.] Both of these theories combine to allow the labour force to grow with a larger female population. The liberal welfare state regime and the social democratic welfare state regime both support these theories. The liberal welfare state looks to encourage the activity of people in a free market economy and to be able to support themselves with private social and family services. The liberal regime calls for women to join the work force in order to pay for these services and contribute to the economy. The social democratic welfare state believes in universalism which means that government provides public services, and thus allows more women to join the work force. In opposition to both of these regimes, the conservative welfare state mostly rejects decommodification and defamilialization. Conservative beliefs prefer a status differentiating society and value the traditional family roles to maintain that. Thus, women are expected to tend to the family, while men remain the primary breadwinners. To help display the differences that these theories have on the gender pay gap, Hadas Mandel continued his research to discover how welfare state policies effect socio-economic positions. He did so using the Luxembourg Income Study from 21 advanced countries, looking at the gender pay gap with low and high income earners. When it comes to low income earners, the study found that there was not a significant wage gap between men and women in the liberal and social democratic regimes. Where there was a significant wage gap was in social democratic regimes and high income wage earners. The study found that this category of earners had a considerably larger gap than the liberal and conservative regimes for high income earners. Also, as was hypothesized in the study, the conservative welfare state had higher gender wage gaps than the other welfare states with low income earners and still had a recognizable gap with high income earners. The conclusion of the study was that the gender wage gap was determined by the advantage or disadvantage mothers faced with the welfare states interference.[Mandel, Hadas. 2012. \\"Winners and Losers: The Consequences of Welfare State Policies for Gender Wage Inequality\\". European Sociological Review. 28:2, pg. 241-262] A similar study done by Solomon Polachek and Jun Xiang, used the same Luxembourg Income Study, but looked at different factors that influence the gender income wage gaps. This study concluded that fertility rate, age gap between spouses in their first marriage, and the top marginal income tax rate are all factors which correlate with the results.[Polachek, Solomon W. and Jun Xiang. 2009. \\"The Gender Pay Gap Across Countries: A Human Capital Approach\\". SOEPpapers. No. 227. pg. 1-62] This states that there are external social factors which influence the pay gap between men and women, as well as the institutional factors which were noted previously. Health Status Perceived health status is impacted in a couple of ways in regards the welfare state regimes. These factors include benefits received through differing ideologies and socio-economic disadvantages which groups of people face. When focusing on benefits which people receive, liberal welfare states have minimal access to benefits because of the minimal government influence. As well, privatized care requires means testing and strict criteria in order to be considered for care. The conservative welfare state has benefits which are earnings related and depend on what the employer decides to offer their employees. Conservative regimes also believe in family ties which impact the amount of personal care a person receives. The liberal and conservative welfare state regimes provide benefits depending on an individuals engagement in the workforce. As has been noted, women tend to face a disadvantage in employment opportunity and wages.[Bambra, C. 2007. \\"Going beyond The three worlds of welfare capitalism:regime theory and public health research\\". Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health. 61:12. pg. 1098-1102] This makes it difficult to receive good health benefits in liberal and conservative regimes. The social democratic welfare state believes in universal public care services in return for full employment by society. The social democratic regime believes in creating equality for all with access to good health and health care. This regime is able to do this because it has a fully contributive market economy which agrees to decommidifying their labour for this care.[Bambra, C. 2007. \\"Going beyond The three worlds of welfare capitalism:regime theory and public health research\\". Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health. 61:12. pg. 1098-1102] A study conducted by Eikemo et al. depicts how welfare state regimes impact health issues caused by socio-economic disadvantages. The authors do so through the European Social Survey which focused on 21 different countries. The main findings were that liberal and social democratic regimes had a higher perceived health rating than the conservative regime. The study relates these findings to the decommodification theory. Liberal and social democratic regimes substitute worker wages and receive care service to compensate for that loss.[Eikemo, Terje Andreas, Claire Bambra, Ken Judge, and Kristen Ringdal. 2008. ‚ÄúWelfare state regimes and differences in self-perceived health in Europe: A multilevel analysis‚Äù. Social Science and Medicine. 66(11). 2281-2295] These services are seen to correlate with better health. On the other hand, the conservative view rejects decommodifiction, causing the access for necessary care to be lower. Socio-economic explanations for gender health also point to women being more vulnerable to health problems. Women disproportionally represent the poorer populations across the welfare state regimes. Women who are economically deprived are more vulnerable to infectious disease, arthritis, migraines, stress, mental illness (depression), and increased risk to heart disease.[Ball, Jennifer and Lorne Tepperman. ‚ÄúThe Stacked Deck: An Introduction to Social Inequality‚Äù. Canada: Oxford University Press. 2016. p.41.] Limitations Even though countries are placed into these three welfare state regimes, many are very close in ideologies with one another. The nations which are identified under each welfare state regime can be classified as ‚Äòprototypes‚Äô. This means that each welfare state regime identified should not be taken as an ideal type. This notion derives from Esping Andersen's decommodification and social stratification index. The index highlights that each country varies in the strength of how strictly they follow the welfare state it is categorized under. Due to the fact that many of the social issues which a country faces is intersectional, they may take on another welfare states ideology to target a certain issue.[Ferragina, Emanuele and Martin Seeleib-Kaiser. 2011. \\"Thematic Review: Welfare regime debate:past, present, futures?\\". Policy and Politics. 39:4. Pg. 583-611] For example, Esping-Anderson notes that, ‚ÄúEuropean conservative regimes have incorporated both liberal and social democratic impulses. Over the decades, they have become less corporatist and less authoritarian.‚Äù [Ferragina, Emanuele and Martin Seeleib-Kaiser. 2011. \\"Thematic Review: Welfare regime debate:past, present, futures?\\". Policy and Politics. 39:4. Pg. 585] A lot of the scrutiny which Esping-Anderson's research concluded was due to the legitimacy of what each welfare state represented. It is important to realize this when looking at gender issues in the welfare state regimes.

Her home and gardens became Mt. Cuba Center, a public garden and research center for Appalachian Piedmont flora that was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Early life Pamela Cunningham was born on May 5, 1906, to Seymour Cunningham and Stephanie (Whitney) Cunningham of Forked Chimney, in Litchfield, Connecticut. She attended boarding schools in the United States and, from 1920 to 1921, in France. In 1924, she graduated from the Knox School of Cooperstown, New York. For several years she took lessons in voice at the Juilliard School in New York City, travelling to Paris in January 1929 to study voice. Marriage While in Paris in 1929, Cunningham met Lammot du Pont Copeland. They married on February 1, 1930. From 1930 to 1935 they lived in Bridgeport, Connecticut. In 1935 they moved to Wilmington, Delaware. In 1935, they purchased 126.7 acres, the beginning of what eventually became a 250-acre estate. In 1937, they completed construction of the Mount Cuba house which became their permanent home. They had three children, Gerret van Sweringen Copeland, Lammot du Pont Copeland, Jr., and Louisa du Pont Copeland. Pamela Copeland was listed in Forbes Magazine in 1985 as one of the wealthiest people in America, with a fortune of $150 million based on holdings in the Du Pont Co. Mount Cuba Main house at Mount Cuba In 1937 the Copelands built Mount Cuba, at 3120 Barley Mill Rd., Greenville, New Castle County, Delaware, not far from Wilmington. It was designed by architects Victorine du Pont Homsey and Samuel Eldon Homsey. The house, in neo-Georgian style with extensive gardens, was furnished with eighteenth century American furniture and wood paneling. Copeland was well known for her collections of American furniture and Chinese export porcelain. An initial plan for formal gardens at Mount Cuba was drawn up by Thomas Warren Sears when the house was built, but it was not completed. In 1951, Marian Cruger Coffin designed an eighteenth century-style garden. In the 1960s, the Copelands worked with landscape architect Seth Kelsey in developing a system of ponds, paths, and plants.  Horticultural career Bloodroot, Sanguinaria canadensis, Mt. Cuba Center Trillium grandiflorum 'Pamela Copeland', Mt. Cuba Center Copeland became interested in native plants from the Piedmont region of the United States. In the 1940s, she created a small wildflower garden at Mount Cuba, which was later expanded. In 1979, her work at Mount Cuba was recognized when the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society awarded her their Certificate of Merit. Copeland established the Mt. Cuba Center for the Study of Piedmont Flora in 1983, with Dr. Richard W. Lighty as its first director. The Center was endowed in 2003 as a foundation for preserving and propagating native plants from the Piedmont region. Copeland competed for many years in the Philadelphia Flower Show, repeatedly winning the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society's Horticultural Sweepstakes Trophy for points in the Horticultural Classes (e.g. 1987, 1988).

The band released their first studio album, Todos los d√≠as sale el sol, in 2010; it featured their most notable hit, \\"Todos los d√≠as sale el sol\\" (also known as \\"Chipir√≥n\\"), which peaked at #12 on the Spain Songs chart. In 2012 they released their second studio album, Revoltosa, leading to extensive tours across eleven European countries. The band's first and only live album, Punk Parranda, was released in 2014. In October 2015, Bongo Botrako announced an indefinite hiatus and a six-date farewell tour, performing their last concert on December 26, 2015. History Early years (2007‚Äì2009) Bongo Botrako frontman Uri Gin√© joined punk rock band Extracto de L√∫pulo as its guitarist, backing vocalist and songwriter in 2003. Some of the songs he wrote didn't fit in the genre of the band, so he kept them apart. In October 2007, Gin√© decided to create his own band with all those songs and named it Bongo Botrako. He recorded a ten- track demo at his small home studio, programming the drums and performing all the rest of instruments himself. After passing the demo around, Gin√© quickly recruited eight more musicians: Nacho Pascual on guitar, Xavi Vallverd√∫ on keyboard, Marc Vallverd√∫ on bass, Gorka Robert on drums, Pitus Siles on percussion, Xavi Artiol on trumpet, √Älex Huguet on trombone and Merc√® Verge on backing vocals. They started rehearsing in January 2008 and they performed live for the first time on March 20, 2008 in their hometown, Tarragona. There were some line-up changes in 2008 and early 2009: Merc√® Verge left the band, Xavi Latorre replaced Pitus Siles on percussion, Xavi Barrero replaced Xavi Artiol on trumpet, Juanhito Saez replaced √Älex Huguet on trombone and Oscar G√≥mez joined the band as saxophonist. In February and March 2009, the band recorded a self-produced seven-track demo, called La maketa, in their rehearsal space. A few days before the expected release date for the demo, Uri Gin√© wrote the song \\"Todos los d√≠as sale el sol\\" while being in Granada, Spain. 500 CD copies of the demo were already being produced at that moment, so they had no time to include the new song. The demo La maketa was released on May 5, 2009 and the band sold the CD copies in their concerts. The song \\"Todos los d√≠as sale el sol\\" was premiered live in Lleida, Spain on May 7, 2009 and it became an instant success in every concert of their catalan tour, despite not being included in the demo. Uri Gin√© left Extracto de L√∫pulo on September 24, 2009 to focus entirely on Bongo Botrako. After almost two years running both bands at the same time, Bongo Botrako had become way more successful than Extracto de L√∫pulo and many gigs started to coincide, so Gin√© felt the need to make the move. In late 2009, there were some more line-up changes that finally set the current line-up: Juanhito Saez and Xavi Latorre left the band, and David Garcia replaced Marc Vallverd√∫ on bass. Todos los d√≠as sale el sol (2010‚Äì2011) As a result of the buzz created by the song \\"Todos los d√≠as sale el sol\\", the band caught the attention of Joni Sah√∫n, an A&R; rep for the independent record label Kasba Music. They recorded their debut album Todos los d√≠as sale el sol in La Atl√°ntida Studio in Barcelona and released it on September 27, 2010 in Spain on Kasba Music. The album was later also released in France, Germany, United Kingdom, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg and Japan. The band's first headline tour started in October 2010 and took them to many sold-out indoor venues across Spain. During spring and summer of 2011, they played well-received sets at festivals in Spain and France which helped add to their growing fanbase. Bongo Botrako released the music video for the album's first single \\"Todos los d√≠as sale el sol\\" on June 23, 2011. The song became very popular in Spain after the men's national basketball team, including Pau Gasol, Marc Gasol and Ricky Rubio, took the habit of singing it before every game in the EuroBasket 2011 Championship, which they eventually won. In September 2011, \\"Todos los d√≠as sale el sol\\" peaked at #12 on the Spain Songs chart and #2 on the iTunes Spain Songs chart. The song accumulates more than 15 million streamings on YouTube and more than 7 million streamings on Spotify, which ultimately makes it Bongo Botrako's most popular song by far. In October 2011, after attending a live show, Germ√°n Quimas√≥ of Sonde3 Producciones became the band's manager, a role that Uri Gin√© had played until then. Revoltosa (2012‚Äì2013) Uri Gin√© performing with Bongo Botrako at Vi√±a Rock Festival 2012 in Spain. The band's second studio album, Revoltosa, was recorded in Garate Studios in Andoain, Spain and produced by Spanish musician Amparo S√°nchez, also known as Amparanoia. It was released on November 12, 2012 in Spain, France, Germany, United Kingdom, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg and Japan on Kasba Music. The music video for the album's first single \\"Revoltosa\\" was released on November 15, 2012 amid controversy surrounding the appearance of riot police officers having fun while using brutal violence against a crowd of peaceful protesters. Uri Gin√© explained that they wanted to denounce police brutality and noted that they used sarcasm, satire and humour because they thought it would attract more attention on the issue than showing realistic images, since people is overexposed to this kind of images. During 2012 and 2013, the band embarked on an extensive tour that took them to France, Italy, Netherlands, Austria, Andorra, Belgium and Switzerland. They also became a frequent act in the line-up of Spanish major festivals such as Vi√±a Rock or Arenal Sound. Punk Parranda and hiatus announcement (2014‚Äì2015) Bongo Botrako performing their last concert before the hiatus. The band's first and only live album, Punk Parranda, was released on November 3, 2014 on Kasba Music. They recorded it performing to a crowd of more than 60,000 people at Vi√±a Rock Festival on May 2, 2014 in Villarrobledo, Spain. During 2014 and 2015, the band continued touring Europe and visited France, Italy, Netherlands, Austria, Andorra, United Kingdom, Germany and Czech Republic. They reached particular success in the Netherlands, where they played a sold-out indoor tour and some major festivals such as Lowlands 2014, Parkpop 2015 and Zwarte Cross 2015. On October 13, 2015, Bongo Botrako announced an indefinite hiatus and a six-date farewell tour in a statement via their official website: > \\"With this release we Bongo Botrako announce that we‚Äôve decided to stop. > It‚Äôs been eight years now since we started, quite a while. Eight years of > joy, of good friends, of incredible collaborations, of exhausting travels, > of wild parties and also of some wounds. But above all it‚Äôs been eight years > we wouldn‚Äôt change for anything in this world. And now it‚Äôs time to breathe. > Because the path enriches the heart but it‚Äôs also a weight for it. And we > don‚Äôt want to continue if it‚Äôs not with the same enthusiasm of the first > day. We don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a see you later or a goodbye, time will tell.\\" ‚Äì > Bongo Botrako Uri Gin√© explained that he felt exhausted after eight years of non-stop touring and noted that the band had lost the enthusiasm. However, he said he would continue to write songs and he left the door open to create a new music project in the future. Bongo Botrako performed their last and 500th concert in Gin√©'s hometown Tarragona on December 26, 2015. Musical style Gin√© has often proclaimed the band's music as \\"punk parranda\\", which translates as \\"punk party\\". He explains that it's not a very accurate label but he likes it because it comprises the punk soul, understood as social activism and fast- paced songs, and the festive tone, characterized by positive messages and danceable rhythms. Bongo Botrako has been described as alternative rock, reggae rock, ska punk, reggae and ska. Many people have also labeled their music as catalan rumba, but they have tried to distance themselves from this label claiming that they have only released three rumba-classifiable songs, all of them in their first album. The band has been known for radically transforming some of their songs when played live, often delivering fast-paced and hard-eged live versions from originally slower and quieter songs. Bongo Botrako's sound has been compared to Mano Negra, The Clash, Bob Marley and Kortatu. Indeed, current Manu Chao's Radio Bemba bassist Gambeat produced the band's live shows from 2011 to 2015. Activism Bongo Botrako has spoken out against animal torture and police brutality. They support Amnesty International and performed two benefit shows for them in Barcelona, in 2012 and 2013. They also included an Amnesty International quote in the music video for their song \\"Revoltosa\\" in 2012.

In 2005, the Shri Durgadevi Devasthanam paid a deposit of $2.05 million to secure the land of one acre at 21 Rose Crescent, Regents Park. The Foundation Ceremony was performed in August 2006. Following the construction of the Temporary Prayer Hall, in late 2006, the three deities were moved to the Temple land, with a momentous inauguration ceremony. The second stage of construction commenced in August 2009 which was building a Wedding Hall/Auditorium and an Educational Hall. The Auditorium cost came up to $1.85 million and the hall has a height elevation of 6 metres. It was completed in 2010 and it stands as the first Hindu community hall within a Temple Complex in Australia. The third & final stage of construction is building the temple, currently the temple is in the final stages of being completed. The temple complex consists of 3 levels: the basement level consists of the wedding hall & educational hall, the ground level consists of the entrance and the main carpark, and the final level consists of the main temple sitting above the carpark. The completed temple celebrated its first Maha Kumbabishekam (Consecration Ceremony) on 7 May 2017 and it marked the first day the new temple complex was opened to the public as a place of worship.

It is now located along Bonanza Creek Road south of the Klondike Highway near Dawson City, Yukon, where it is preserved as one of the National Historic Sites of Canada. It is the largest wooden-hulled dredge in North America. With its 72 large buckets, the dredge excavated gravel at the rate of 22 buckets per minute, processing of material per day. It was in use from late April or early May until late November each season, and sometimes throughout winter. During its operational lifetime, it captured nine tons of gold. Background About south of the dredge's current site, further into the Klondike Valley, is the Discovery Claim where gold was found in August 1896 by prospector George Carmack, his Tagish wife Kate, her brother Skookum Jim, and their nephew Dawson Charlie. This is considered the site where the Klondike Gold Rush began. Integral to the operation of the dredge were the services available at Dawson City. There, financial services provided by the banks, administrative services provided by the Government of Canada, and the rail and steamship transportation network terminating at the city ensured that machinery needed for operation of the dredge would be readily supplied. The Canadian Klondyke Mining Company built the Twelve Mile ditch in 1909, which would supply the water to operate hydraulic monitors on dredges. It also built dams and ditches to generate hydroelectricity, and by 1911 the North Fork Hydro Power Plant was operational about from the dredges it energized. History Canadian No. 4 in 1916 Designed by the Marion Steam Shovel Company, the bucketline sluice dredge was built on site at Claim 112 Below Discovery from mid 1912 until the onset of winter. The assembly site was near Ogilvie Bridge, named for William Ogilvie, near the current location of the bridge carrying the Klondike Highway to Dawson City. Construction was supervised by Howard Brenner, an engineer employed by the Marion Steam Shovel Company, who also supervised construction of Dredge No. 3 at the same time. A contract for the parts dated 13 March 1912 specified their shipment to the site in the summer of 1912, at a cost of $134,800 for each dredge, and the hull was built by the Canadian Klondike Mining Company. The Canadian Klondyke Mining Company began operating the dredge in May 1913. After eleven years of operation, it had cut its way to the Boyle Concession, where it sank in 1924. By 1927, it had been refloated and worked its way to Hunker Creek, where it could produce up to of gold a day at claim 67 Below Discovery. It ceased operations in the area on 11 July 1940, and was rebuilt by the Yukon Consolidated Gold Corporation on Bonanza Creek, where it resumed operations on 11 September 1941. The wooden hull of the original dredge was discarded, left in the pond where it sank, but all other parts were salvaged for use in the reconstructed dredge. It worked its way downstream on one side of the valley, then back up the other side, until being decommissioned on 1 November 1959. The immediate success of the dredge resulted in the Canadian Klondyke Mining Company ordering the construction of two more dredges the following year. Operation The electrically-powered machine required while digging, and more when moving its gangplank. With its installed hydraulic monitors, the eight-storey dredge would cut into gravel banks, washing down the released material for processing. The machine created a dredge pond by virtue of its operation, its size dependent on the valley in which it was operating, but sometimes reaching . It would rotate on two spuds, each and long. The digging ladder enabled the dredge to dig a cut with an average arc of about . This wide arc was possible because of the use of two spuds. It could reach above water level and below it, with each of the 72 buckets capable of moving loads up to . Each bucket weighed , each flange , and each securing pin . Gold was recovered in a rotating long trommel screen with diameter and 12.5% grade. A pipe was suspended within the trommel, carrying water upwards to spray the incoming material, cleaning it and breaking up larger lumps. Finer material (gold, sand, and pebbles) was sieved through holes in the screen, which rotated at 7.8 revolutions per minute, into a distributor box. From there, it flowed into sluice tables, long troughs with an area of which had a constant flow of water. About 75% of the gold was caught in a coconut matting and steel riffles at the bottom of the troughs. A smaller distributor captured another 20% of the gold, and all remaining material was washed out into the dredge pond. The larger pieces of gravel were ejected from a wide stacker at its rear, a belt moving at . These tailings remain as a \\"vast, rippled blight on the landscape\\". Particles of gold and nuggets too large to fit through the screen holes would be ejected with the gravel. In its 46 years of operations, the machine mined nine tons of gold, dredging 22 buckets of gravel every minute, about per day. Dredge No. 4 had a much greater capacity than other dredges operated in the area, and could sometimes operate through winter. In 1918, it began operating on 1 May, and continued until 3 April 1919, at which time it was stopped for repairs. It worked without interruption from late April or early May until late November every year. At the end of each season, the buckets were removed. More than twenty dredges operated throughout the same area, with the first built in 1899. Crew The electric motor was maintained by the \\"oiler\\" The crew who operated the dredge consisted of various positions. The dredge master was responsible for ensuring the productivity of the dredge, and would also serve as winter watchman. Among the position's activities were documenting crew hours and breakdowns, and preparing a dredging plan for the area to be excavated. The winchman operated the dredge from the master control room, taking over for the dredge master on the evening and night shifts. Among the winchman's tasks were supervising the crew and operating the digging ladder. An oiler lubricated and maintained all moving parts, including pumps, motors, tumblers, and the main drive, and replaced worn parts, also substituting for the winchman at times. The bow decker was responsible for the bucket line, cleaning clay away from the lip of each bucket as it passed along the digging ladder, inspected buckets and pins for damage, cracked large rocks in the buckets with a sledgehammer, removed root and log debris from the buckets, and cleaned the deck. A stern decker was responsible for the stacker, ensuring it did not interfere with the power lines, that it remained clear of the tailings, and that any debris that jammed the conveyor belt was cleared. Large dredges, such as Dredge No. 4, also employed a panner, who obtained samples of material from the bucket line to inspect its colour. The lowest-ranking group was known as the \\"bull gang\\", three to five members who were responsible for the machine's cables, the incoming power lines, and the \\"deadmen\\". The latter were two bulldozers along the shore of the dredge pond, attached to the dredge by steel cables, and were used as anchors. National Historic Site A sign at the National Historic Site depicting the parts of the dredge. The dredge lay dormant where it was decommissioned from 1959. In the spring of 1960, a dam collapse flooded the creek in which it was lay, rotating it 180¬∞ and lifting it off the shelf on which it was resting. It was purchased by Parks Canada in 1970 for $1, to become part of its proposed commemoration program for the Klondike goldfields. It was not until 1991 that it was excavated, and in 1992 it was moved to its current site, where it is protected from seasonal flooding. On 22 September 1997, Dredge No. 4 was designated a National Historic Site of Canada because of its association with Klondike gold mining and as symbolic of the evolution of gold mining from a labour-intensive activity to a mechanical process. It is one of three National Historic Sites in the Dawson City area, the others being the and the Dawson Historical Complex. In 2012, Parks Canada reduced its budget, eliminating 600 jobs and stating that historic sites with low visitation would be accessible only on self-guided tours instead of being led by a guide. Among them was Dredge No. 4. Today, a private company provides guided tours of the dredge.

It was named President's College. The president indicated his dream that this school will become a great centre of learning in the north and that he will watch its progress with keen interest.http://www.africaschoolsonline.com/institute.php?ins_id=55 Later, it was simply called Navrongo School (NAVASCO). Its mascot is the horn, an important northern Ghanaian symbol of royalty, bravery, and leadership. The school's motto is \\"LUX BOREALIS\\" in Latin. It means \\"The Light of the North\\". Old students are known as NABIA, a local word meaning Citizen. NAVASCO is one of few schools in northern Ghana with a wealth of physical infrastructure, a major reason for its ability to educate many people. It is the oldest and prestigious secondary school in the Upper East Region and among about eight elite schools in northern Ghana. In the 1970s, it became known for its agricultural activities under Mr. MacDonald, a veteran British educator.http://thechronicle.com.gh/navasco-the-great-school/ The school has a dam for irrigation farming and an orchard some few metres from the Chapel. There is the Kasadjan Sports Stadium for recreation. The famous MacDonald Hall serves assembly and entertainment purposes. The school library served the school and the community for years. A workshop also ensures that not much is bought from outside of school. Carpentry and metal works for all things on campus are carried out in this workshop. There were fourteen residential halls for students as at 2015. They are Kwegyir Aggrey, John F. Kennedy, Livingtone, Abatey, Ferguson, Garvey, Guggisberg, Nkrumah, Volta, and Abavana halls all for gentlemen. Slessor, Tono, Independence, and Luther King halls served ladies. The school offers programmes in Agricultural Science, General Science, General Business, General Arts, and Visual Arts and Home Economics. Students have numerous options to choose from in these general programmes. There is a well equipped Science Laboratory and the School Farm both of which offer practical training to science students. The Debating Society is open to all students but is practically dominated by General Arts students who use it as a public speaking training ground.http://noyawagh.com/events/navasco-overpowers- awesco-win-upper-east-debate/ It has produced many of the famed politicians who graduated from this school. The first headmaster was J.K Fiegbor. He was followed by Agyemang Dickson, Crawford, and then Mr. C.G MacDonald, probably the famous headmaster in the school's history. He used students to construct MacDonald Hall, the assembly place for students. Under him, the teaching of Mathematics so improved that it became a source of attraction for many talented students who wanted to better their Maths for progress into higher education. Mr. Adenze Kangah and Mr. Alosius Alexis Abem were also two well- known headmasters of the school in the 1980s before Madam Katumi assumed responsibility in the 1990s. She was instrumental in strengthening discipline and improving performance. Mr. Patrick Tangonyire took over in the 2000s. The school educated many of the north's elite. Others come from the southern parts of Ghana.

He established the Equator Station, or Station de l‚Äô√âquateur, today Mbandaka, and concluded a treaty with the powerful Zanzibar trader Tippu Tip at the Stanley Falls station, today Kisangani. He is known for having confirmed that the Uele River was the upper part of the Ubangi River. Early years Alphonse van G√®le was born in Brussels on 25 April 1848. He enlisted as a volunteer in the 8th Line Regiment in 1867, was made a sub-lieutenant in 1872 and became a lieutenant in the 3rd Line Regiment in 1878. He was appointed Adjoint d'√âtat-Major (Deputy Chief of Staff) in 1881. Colonial career Route to L√©opoldville (1882‚Äì1883) In 1881 Van G√®le offered his services to the International African Association as Deputy Lieutenant to the State Major, and received a short training course at the Institut Cartographique Militaire. On 5 May 1882 he embarked at Southampton for Cape Town, where he joined the engineer Lieutenant Louis Valcke, who had gone to the east coast of Africa to recruit 250 Zanzibaris there and bring them to the estuary of Congo River. They reached the mouth of the Congo on 3 July 1882, then traveled to Banana and Vivi. Henry Morton Stanley had arrived in Vivi on 4 July 1882 and was organizing an expedition up the Congo River to the Stanley Falls, which would take control of the country along the route. When Valcke and Van G√®le arrived in Vivi with their contingent, Stanley at once instructed them to work on construction of the road from Vivi to Isangila, bypassing the rapids and leading to the navigable section up to Manyanga, then to connect Manyanga to L√©opoldville. The work had to be done quickly so the dismantled Association internationale Africaine steamer and goods could be carried to L√©opoldville for the planned expedition. In the course of the work Van G√®le suffered from violent bouts of fever and had to be evacuated to Boma. He recovered, rejoined Valcke, and helped him until a post was erected on the territory of Chief Lutete as a staging point for the Manyanga-L√©opoldville transport. Van G√®le took charge of the Lutete post and ran it effectively until 1 April 1883, when he was appointed to replace Valcke, who had himself been appointed to replace Charles-Marie de Braconnier in L√©opoldville. √âquateur (1883‚Äì1884) In May 1883 Van G√®le and Camille Coquilhat were appointed to accompany Stanley in his expedition to the Upper Congo. The expedition left L√©opoldville on 9 May 1883 with all their steamers: En avant, Eclaireur, Royal and A.I.A.. The expedition had seven Europeans and 67 Africans. Stanley reached the mouth of the Ruki River on 9 June 1883 and directed Van G√®le and Coquilhat to build a station there. On 20 June 1883 Van G√®le signed a treaty with Ikenge, principal chief in the district of Ibonga-Wangata, and Ipambi, principal chief in the same district, in which they ceded all property in perpetuity, the land and the rights to exploit the resources of the country and to create and roads and establishments suitable for developing the commercial and other relations of the Committee and Expedition. Assisted by Coquilhat, Van G√®le built a model station and was named its commander. It was called Equator Station, or Station de l‚Äô√âquateur, then Equateurville, later Coquilhatville, today Mbandaka. The Belgians became involved in local power struggles. In one conflict a local ruler was killed and the spoils of war ended up in Van G√®le's ethnographic collection. While the √âquateur station was being built, Stanley explored the Lulonga River and Lake Tumba. He returned to Leopoldville, then immediately left for the Falls. He returned to √âquateurville, where he praised the station, the discipline of the soldiers and the good but not over-familiar relations with the local people. First Ubangi expedition (1884) At the beginning of April 1884 Van G√®le briefly explored the course of the Ruki River. On 17 April 1884 Edmond Hanssens, who had replaced Stanley in the Upper Congo, arrived in Equateurville. Two days later Hanssens and Van G√®le set out in the En Avant to explore the Ubangi River with the pharmacist Courtois, de Gu√©rin and the mechanic Amelot, a crew of ten Zanzibaris and a local African who was to act as their interpreter. Going downstream the steamer skirted the right bank of the Congo River, but was carried by the current into a maze of islands. After three days they saw some native fishermen in a canoe. Van G√®le managed to persuade them to act as pilots, and after four hours of full steam on 21 April 1884 entered a strong stream of yellow water, the Ubangi, which they ascended to the Bisongo village. They received a friendly reception, and Hanssens exchanged blood with Chief Mkoko. The chief agreed to place both banks of the Ubangi under the protection of the International African Association. After returning to Equateurville Hanssens left Van G√®le in charge and took Coquihat with him to found the Bangala station, the future Nouvelle Anvers. Van G√®le concluded nine treaties between 26 April and 16 July 1884, including several that were signed in the Ruki River region. Upper Congo (1884‚Äì1885) Hanssens left L√©opoldville for Belgium on 8 November after dividing his command into two regions. Guillaume Casman was given the territory from the Pool to Equateur, while Van G√®le took the territory from there to the Falls. On 11 November 1884 Casman left for √âquateur in an expedition with three steamers: the Royal, A.I.A. and En Avant. The members included Casman, Charles Liebrechts and Camille Van den Plas. They stopped at Kimpoko to embark the Swedish lieutenant Edde Gleerup, who had been appointed second to Wester at the Falls. On 24 November 1884 they reached Msuata. Casman arrived at Equateur Station on 12 December 1884, where Van G√®le handed over command in a ceremony before the native chiefs. Van G√®le then left for a visit to the Falls accompanied by the intendant Van den Plas and Gleerup. Well before reaching the Aruwimi River he noticed that the local people had been terrorized by a recent attack by the Arabs against the Basokos. He reached the Basoko villages at the mouth of the Aruwimi on 20 January 1885. The people had fled, and the Arabs had built a fortified camp there. They greeted Van G√®le with a show of friendship. The supply expedition continued on to Stanley Falls. The land upstream from the Aruwimi had all been deserted by the people, who had fled the Arabs. Soon after the expedition reached the Falls, Tippo-Tip sent his nephew Rachid to greet Van G√®le. Later that day Tippo-Tip himself visited Van G√®le and assured him he wanted cordial relations with the Europeans and would stop hunting for slaves. Van G√®le thought it was better to try to use Arab power to help the Belgians get established, as did Hanssens and Coquilhat. He left Lieutenant Gleerup at the Falls with Tippo-Tip to support Lieutenant Arvid Wester. He made many treaties with the local chiefs on his way downstream. His term over, he reached Europe on 15 May 1885, where the King named him a knight of his order. On 5 June 1885 Van G√®le left Europe for the Congo as commander of the territory between the Aruwimi and Stanley Falls. He arrived in the Congo on 25 July 1885 and reached L√©opoldville on 26 October 1885. He developed a fever, and was forced to return. He spent some time in Madeira, then returned to Brussels on 15 May 1886, completely recovered. Second Ubangi expedition (1886) Ubangi River basin The geographer Alphonse-Jules Wauters had published the theory that the Uele River which Georg August Schweinfurth had explored was the same as the Ubangi River explored by Hanssens. The Congo Free State government charged Van G√®le with exploring the Ubangi above 4¬∞ north to resolve the problem. He should also conclude treaties with chiefs of territories on the left bank of the river. Van G√®le, in the company of Raert, embarked in Ostend on 30 June 1886, en route to Vivi via London and Madeira. His mission was said to be to organize the Falls region. On 2 August 1886 Van G√®le, accompanied by lieutenant Li√©nart, left L√©opoldville on the Henry Reed of the American Baptist Missionary Union. On 11 October 1886 they left Equateur Station and entered the Ubangi the next day, passed the French post of N'Kundja and anchored upstream at a small island near Bisongo. The commander of Kundja joined them there and told Van G√®le the French government had instructed him to deny access to the Ubangi, but Van G√®le argued that the Berlin Conference had declared freedom of navigation of the Congo and its tributaries, and proceeded upstream. He noted that up to 4¬∞ the river only had relatively small tributaries on its left bank. Van G√®le reached the foot of the Zongo rapids on 20 October 1886, and docked in Crocodile Bay. For ten days Vangele and Li√©nart struggled to force the Henry Reed up through one of the five rocky channels, but were defeated and returned down the Ubangi on 4 November 1886. They explored the navigable portions of the Lobay River, Ibenga River and Ngiri River on the way. They returned to Equateurville on 4 December. They reached L√©opoldville on 29 December 1886. In February 1887 they used the Henry Reed to explore the Lulonga River and its tributary the Lopori River. Third Ubangi‚ÄìUele expedition (1887‚Äì1888) On the way back to L√©opoldville to organize a new attempt on the Ubangi, Van G√®le met Stanley coming up the river on the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition. Stanley had a letter from Brussels ordering Van Gele to try to reach the upper Ubangi by way of the Itimbiri River and Djabir. On 1 July Van G√®le left L√©opoldville on the A.I.A. and the Henry Reed with Li√©nart and Francis Dhanis, towing barges carrying 100 soldiers. He landed Dhanis at the Bangala station, then went up the Itimbiri to the G√¥ rapids. From there he tried to clear a road through the forest to the north, but gave up when it seemed impossible to make progress. He returned to the √âquateur post on 11 March 1887, where he gave the Henry Reed back to the missionaries. Van G√®le then went to meet governor-General Camille Janssen in Boma, who authorized an expedition towards the Uele by the Ubangi. He left L√©opoldville on the En-Avant towing a large pirogue from the Falls to make his another attempt on the Ubangi, again with Li√©nart. They reached Zongo on 21 November 1887. Zongo falls It was still not possible to pass the rapids, so Van G√®le decided to clear a road through the forest, disassemble the steamer, carry it round the rapids, and then reassemble it. While this was being done, he went by pirogue up to the Bonga rapids, which he decided the steamer could pass. After he returned the steamer was brought round the Zongo falls and relaunched. It passed the Bonga rapids without difficulty, and passed the Buzy rapids with the help of cables. On 1 January 1888 the steamer reached the region of the hostile Yakoma people. The Yakoma population thought the Belgians were Sudanese merchants. Lieutenant Li√©nart was attacked, and the Belgians fought back and burned the village. The expedition was now at the point where the Mbomou River joins the Uele to form the Ubangi. Van G√®le decided that the larger of the two rivers was the Uele River described by Schweinfurth, and that the geographer Wauters was correct. During a forced halt to repair the steamer, the expedition was attacked by the Yakomis in a flotilla of pirogues but managed to fight them off. Van Gele returned to Equateurville on 1 February 1888, then continued to L√©opoldville. He was charged with leading the expedition to Stanley Falls that Li√©vin Van de Valde had prepared before dying. The expedition was to supply and reorganized the station at the Falls. It left L√©opoldville on 28 April 1888 and took possession of the Falls station on 15 June 1888. The station, which Stanley had established on Usuma Island, was rebuilt on the right bank of the Congo downstream from the island. Van G√®le returned on the steamer Le Stanley. He passed lieutenant Louis Haneuse, who was going to take command at the Falls. He reached L√©opoldville on 12 July 1888, and on 15 September 1888 returned to Belgium. Fourth Ubangi‚ÄìUele expedition (1889‚Äì1891) Confluence of the Uelle and Mbomou rivers. Yakoma is the light area on the left (south) bank of the combined stream. In January 1889 the king gave Van G√®le a mission to further explore the Ubangi and its tributaries. He left Antwerp on 6 February 1889 with the rank of State Inspector. His expedition left L√©opoldville on 21 May 1889 on the En avant and the Association internationale Africaine. The expedition reached Zongo on 25 June 1889, where a station was founded as a base of operations with Captain L√©on Hanolet in command. The Association internationale Africaine was almost lost in the Zongo rapids. In September 1889 they reached what would become Banzyville. They established a post here, above Zongo, and sub-lieutenant L√©on Busine was put in command. Van G√®le and Georges Le Marinel studied the north shore of the river between Banzyville and Mokoangui and discovered the mouths of the Kuanga and Benghi rivers. On 7 December 1889 Van G√®le started a new exploration further up the Ubangi. He explored the lower course of the right tributary Kotto River, which he reached on 12 December 1889. He returned downstream to Banzyville, which he reached in January 1890. He left there on 11 May 1890, and reached the mouth of the Kotto at Bend√© on 29 May 1890. He went up this river and signed treaties with the local chiefs. Van G√®le returned to the junction of the Bomu, the Mbomo river described by Wilhelm Junker, and the large Koyou river coming from the southeast, which was Junker's Makoua and Schweinfurth's Uele. He founded a large station at the juncture of the two rivers, and placed Edouard De Rechter in command. At about 23¬∞ longitude the river was blocked by a series of rocky obstacles that the steamers could not pass. The water level rose in July and the steamers entered the Uele, but at 22¬∞04' longitude they were blocked by impassible rapids. Van G√®le continued by pirougue, passing the rapids at Banafia and Bogazo, but could not pass the Mokwangou falls. After returning to the Yakoma camp, Van G√®le decided to explore the Bomu river and visit Bangasso, but the steamers were blocked after a day by the Goui falls. Bangassou came to visit Van G√®le, who then returned to Banzyville. On 27 May 1890 the expedition of L√©on Roget and Jules Alexandre Milz reached the Uele River opposite the Djabir village. Sultan Djabir signed a treaty with Milz and a post was established on the site of the former Egyptian zeriba of Deleb. Milz began construction of the station while Roget, guided by Sultan Djabir, tried unsuccessfully to join Van G√®le in Yakoma. In July‚ÄìAugust 1890 Milz and his assistant Mahutte and Sultan Djabir led 100 fusiliers and 400 lancers in an attempt to push through the non-submissive people along the right bank, but were forced to return to Djabir after nine days. Van G√®le from a 1908 biography Van G√®le heard of the presence of a European in Djabar on 18 November 1890 and set out via a roundabout route up the Uele, reaching the village of Gamanza on 2 December. The next day he met Milz, who was coming to meet him. This resolved the Ubangi-Uele question. Milz and Van G√®le heard that the Arabs were operating in the lower Bima River and on the Rubi River and set out for that region. In December 1890 they succeeded in expelling the Muslim traders. Van G√®le then returned down the Uele to the post at Yakoma, mapping the river to its junction with the Bomu. With the French established on the upper Ubangi, Van Gele began to conclude increasing numbers of treaties. In November 1891 he handed over to Georges Le Marinel and left for Europe. He returned to Europe on 15 January 1892. Later career In July 1895 news arrived of the first mutinies in Luluabourg. Van G√®le offered to help, and his services were accepted, but before he could embark news came that another commander had been appointed in Boma to lead the troops to suppress the revolt. In December 1897 Van Gele was appointed Deputy Governor General to replace Francis Dhanis as Commander in Chief of the Arab Zone. Dhanis's vanguard had revolted during the Haut-Ituri expedition due to bad treatment of the Force Publique troops by their Belgian officers. The mutiny developed into the widespread Batetela rebellion, a resistance movement against the Belgian occupation. Van Gele reached Stanley Falls in March 1898, but due to poor communication did not gain overall command until September 1898. The next month he fell ill, and had to hand command back to Dhanis and return to Europe. He reached Europe on 10 January 1899, and retired from the army as a lieutenant colonel. Van G√®le became involved as director of various colonial companies including the Compagnie du Katanga, Compagnie Bruxelloise du Commerce du Haut-Congo, Compagnie du Kasai, Cotonco, Ciments du Katanga, Mini√®re AruwimiIturi, Safricas, Manucongo, Mini√®re de Luebo, Mini√®re de la Lueta, Kilo-Moto and Banque du Congo Belge. He died in Brussels on 23 February 1939.

It comprises two tracts of land; the main tract, located immediately adjacent Big Woods State Forest, and the Parker's Branch tract, located nearby. History The main tract of Big Woods WMA was established on land originally owned by International Paper, who had used the property for timber production. A parcel was purchased from International Paper in 2006 by The Nature Conservancy, who held the land in anticipation of eventual sale to the Commonwealth of Virginia. In 2010, the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries (VDGIF) and the Virginia Department of Forestry (VDOF) together purchased the parcel from The Nature Conservancy for $6.4 million; funding for the purchase was provided by a Virginia land conservation bond, the Virginia Land Conservation Fund, and grants from the U.S. Forest Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The parcel was divided between the two agencies, with VDGIF establishing the WMA immediately adjacent to the Big Woods State Forest, managed by VDOF. The Parker's Branch tract of the property was acquired by VDGIF in November 2016. As with the main tract, the land was purchased from The Nature Conservancy, who had again acquired the property for eventual sale to the state. The tract was purchased for $3.8 million using contributions from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Virginia Land Conservation Foundation. Description Big Woods WMA covers a total of , split between the main tract and the Parker's Branch tract. The main tract is adjacent to Big Woods State Forest, and the two units are managed with similar goals. Both units are also contiguous with The Nature Conservancy's Piney Grove Preserve, a property dedicated to restoring longleaf pine forest for the benefit of the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker. Management of both the WMA and the state forest also aims to improve habitat for the red-cockaded woodpecker though planting of longleaf pine, the installation of nesting boxes, and prescribed burns. The main tract is covered by pine forests; much of the Parker's Branch tract is covered by recently cut timber stands that will be replanted with longleaf pine. Game animals found on the WMA include bobwhite quail, white-tailed deer, eastern wild turkeys, pheasant, fox, and red squirrels. Public use and access Big Woods WMA is open to the public for hunting, trapping, fishing, hiking, and primitive camping. , hunting with hounds is forbidden on the Parker's Branch tract, but is permitted within the main tract. Access for persons 17 years of age or older requires a valid hunting or fishing permit, or a WMA access permit.

It expressed support for efforts by ECOWAS to peacefully resolve the 2016‚Äì2017 Gambian constitutional crisis, calling on President Yahya Jammeh to step down and allow a peaceful transition to the President-elect, Adama Barrow, as well as supporting the African Union and ECOWAS decisions in recognizing Adama Barrow as the new President. The measure was adopted by a vote of 15 supporting, none opposed, and none abstained.  Background   The Gambian constitutional crisis  The Gambia's presidential elections were held on 1 December 2016 with the Independent Electoral Commission previously accepting three nominees in November 2016 which included Yahya Jammeh of the Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Reconstruction (APRC), Adama Barrow of Coalition 2016, and Mama Kandeh of the Gambia Democratic Congress, respectively. On 2 December 2016, Yahya Jammeh conceded defeat to the electoral candidate Adama Barrow. However, on the 9 December, Yahya Jammeh rejected the election results, sparking the Gambian constitutional crisis. He refused to step down and allow Barrow to accede to the presidency, and demanded to remain in power until new elections could be organized and conducted.  Resolution background  The situation in the Gambia had escalated to crisis proportions, including the displacement of about 46,000 people who had fled the Gambia to neighbouring Senegal and Guinea-Bissau. President-Elect Barrow himself had left for Senegal due to fear for this safety in the Gambia and had not even been able to return for the funeral of his 8-year-old son, who died unexpectedly during this period after being attacked by dogs. More than 75% of the displaced people arriving in Senegal were children, accompanied primarily by women. Earlier on the same day the resolution was passed, Barrow was sworn in as President of Gambia in the Gambian embassy in Dakar, Senegal. The resolution did not endorse the ECOWAS military intervention in the Gambia, which also occurred on the same day the resolution was passed. Rather, it requested ECOWAS to pursue \\"political means first\\" in its efforts to resolve the crisis. In earlier proposed drafts, the Council had considered alternative language endorsing ECOWAS in \\"all necessary measures\\", which would have been an endorsement for military action. However, some members of the Council, including Egypt, Bolivia, and Russia, had objected to the stronger language. In its press release, the Council said that \\"A number of speakers ... said the adoption did not imply the Council's endorsement of possible military measures\\", and specifically mentioned that Egypt and Bolivia had expressed this view. The resolution followed a previous unanimous United Nations Security Council statement issued on 10 December 2016 that had similarly called on Jammeh to \\"respect the choice of the sovereign people of The Gambia\\" and allow Barrow to accede to the presidency. The UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon also released a statement on 10 December expressing dismay at Jammeh's rejection of the results of the election. The Secretary-General had previously commended the peaceful election process in the Gambia, and had congratulated President-elect Adama Barrow on his victory on 2 December 2016.  Passage of the resolution  The resolution was passed by a vote of 15 supporting, none opposed, and none abstained.  Aftermath  On the same day the resolution was passed, armed forces from the ECOWAS countries of Senegal, Nigeria, and Ghana cooperated to enter the Gambia with ground forces, a naval blockade, and air support in a military intervention to compel Jammeh's departure. The army and navy of the Gambia did not resist, as the navy declared support for Barrow and the army said the matter was political in nature and it would stay neutral. After a few hours and only minor clashes with pro-Jammeh MFDC forces near the border village of Kanilai, the home town of Yahya Jammeh, the incursion was halted to allow a final attempt to negotiate the peaceful departure of Jammeh. Two days later, on 21 January 2017, Jammeh agreed to step down and left the Gambia for exile in Equatorial Guinea. There were no reports of casualties. About 4,000 ECOWAS troops remained in the Gambia to establish order in preparation for Barrow to return and consolidate his presidency.

Joseph A. Suneg, ca 1973 Joseph Anthony Suneg (11 October 1897 ‚Äì 21 May 1989) was ordained a priest of the Catholic Church in the United States and later elevated to Domestic Prelate by Pope Pius XIIHonorary Alumnus Citation, Creighton University, Omaha, Nebraska, January 29, 1970 in official recognition of his valuable service to the growth of the Catholic Church in Omaha. He established the landmark 12 acre St. Margaret Mary parish campus in the heart of Omaha adjacent to University of Nebraska at Omaha, Archdiocese of Omaha Chancery, and Memorial Park (Omaha) on U.S. Route 6 (Dodge Street). His only assignment lasted forty-six years‚Äîthe entirety of his active priestly career.  Early life  Josef Anton Sunega was born in what was once part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

At the age of eight he emigrated to the United States sailing aboard the SS Zeeland (1900) from Antwerp with his mother and three sisters. Joseph arrived in New York on September 4, 1906, settling in Cleveland, Ohio (his father Johann, a peddler, arrived earlier, on July 20, 1906List or Manifest of Alien Passengers for the U.S. Immigration Officer at Port of Arrival - SS Mississippi sailing from Antwerp, July 7, 1906 arriving at Port of New York, July 20, 1906). Rev. Nicholas Pfeil, pastor of St. Peter Church (Cleveland, Ohio) encouraged Joseph to consider a vocation. \\"The good old pastor in Cleveland -- I was an altar boy for him. He'd ask me what I was going to be... Just to please the old man, I'd say a priest.\\"The Catholic Voice: Omaha, NE, 1988, June 17, \\"The Lord Has Been Good to Me\\" In 1911 after graduation from eighth grade, Joseph entered Pontifical College Josephinum in Columbus, Ohio.The Josephinum Review, Journal of the Pontifical College Josephinum, Wednesday, February 12, 1958. pp. 6-7. Before he completed his studies, his father died and it seemed as though Joseph might not be able to finish. His two older sisters went to work as seamstresses to support the family and ensure his education at the seminary.Ervin, Frank (1979). St Margaret Mary's 1919-1979 60 Years (1 ed.). Hackensack, NJ: Custombook, Inc. pp. 6‚Äì7. While at Pontifical College, Sunega became acquainted with Edward Joseph Hunkeler a fellow seminarian who told him of the wide open spaces and the fresh country air of Nebraska. The idea of a rural German-speaking community appealed to the young Sunega, who felt that Ohio was becoming too crowded. He decided to move west to Nebraska. Sunega was ordained by the Most Reverend P. Fumasoni-Biondi, D.D., Apostolic Delegate to the United States, at the Pontifical College Josephinum on Monday, June 11, 1923. He offered his first solemn mass on Sunday, June 17, 1923, at St. Ignatius of Antioch church in Cleveland.Personal Letter, Pontifical College Josephinum, Director of Alumni Relations, Msgr. Clarence M DeRuntz, May 29, 1989  Priesthood  A month after his ordination on June 11, 1923, Bishop Jeremiah James Harty appointed Suneg to St. Margaret Mary parish in Omaha; not the country setting he had hoped for. Established only four years earlier in 1919 (yet without a permanent church), the parish had been trying to pull itself out of its financial problems. Early in 1924, pastor Father Leo Patrick was transferred and Suneg was appointed administrator of the parish. Suneg chipped away steadily at the $60,000 debt. He lived frugally. He managed without an assistant, relying on part-time help first from the Jesuits at Creighton University and later from the Missionary Society of St. Columban. When Suneg's mother Mary and sister Anna came to Omaha to keep house for him, the family purchased a home on the southeast corner of 50th and California Streets.The Official Catholic Directory, P.J. Kenedy & Sons, 1928, The University of Michigan, p.495 This freed space in the former parish house, and Suneg remodeled the house to make another classroom on the first floor and a music room and lunch room for the nuns on the second floor. Whenever possible, Suneg saved the parish money by doing the work himself. One enduring feature of Suneg's character was his ability to recognize the potential utility of discarded materials, then acquire and re-purpose them for a practical new life. Among the waste materials Suneg turned to ornamental purposes include beautiful iron grills once part of the George W. Lininger Art Museum, chandeliers from the Burlington Station (Omaha, Nebraska), and wooden slabs from a beer vat in the old Metz Brewery. Suneg's recycling efforts were more than just necessity, he considered it his hobby, \\"Do not wait, therefore, until you have time to kill to follow your hobby. It will keep you mentally alert and physically fit. Your chosen life's work will not be a mere drudgery, a worrisome monotony. You will find renewed interest, enthusiasm and real joy in your daily occupation.\\" Sunday World Herald, Omaha, NE, Sept 22, 1935 Suneg maintained a close working relationship with Fr. Edward Flanagan, founder of Boys Town, Nebraska, which was until 1953 located within the boundaries of St. Margaret Mary Parish. Fellow European immigrants, Fr. Flanagan had been ordained a priest at the University of Innsbruck in 1912 in Suneg's native land. As one documented example, Suneg worked closely with Fr. Flanagan on marriage arrangements to resolve the case of Japanese Americans Raymond Uchiyamada and Barbara Saneto who had been interred at Camp Manzanar in California during the Second World War. Fr. Flanagan secured release of a number of interred Japanese-Americans out of Camp Manzanar in exchange for employment at his home for boys near Omaha. With Saneto a parishioner of St. Margaret Mary, Suneg (as pastor) approved Fr. Flanagan's request for the Uchiyamada/Saneto wedding at Boys Town in a March 10, 1944 letter followed by Flangan's thank you reply in a letter on the very day of the ceremony, March 14, 1944.Personal Letter: Fr. Flanagan to Fr. Suneg, March 14, 1944  Building a parish   Groundwork  By 1926 the congregation had grown to eighty families and it was becoming evident that the temporary worship space above the school would soon be inadequate. Suneg began to plan for a new church even though the parish was deeply in debt. When six and a half acres became available near 62nd and Dodge Streets, Suneg saw it as the site of a beautiful new church. He wanted to buy the properties, but Bishop Joseph Rummel did not think so much land was necessary. When Suneg was named pastor on April 20, 1928 the parish had expanded to nearly 200 families. As a result, the diocesan Board of Consultors proceeded to authorize the purchase of the Dodge Street property on June 4, 1929.Official Letter: Omaha Diocese Board of Consultors to Rev. Joseph Suneg, June 4, 1929 Despite struggling through the effects of the Great Depression, the mortgage on the temporary church-school had been pared to $25,000 and the parishioners were supportive of their pastor. Suneg suggested it was time to start subscriptions to raise money for the new church. A letter from Bishop Rummel dated March 12, 1931, congratulated Suneg and the parish on the reduction of the debt. A new church committee was formed in May 1931.Ervin, Frank (1979). St Margaret Mary's 1919-1979 60 Years (1 ed.). Hackensack, NJ: Custombook, Inc. pp. 6‚Äì7.

Charles Jay Connick of Boston designed the stained glass windows. The architect Leo A Daly was chosen and in May 1941 ground was broken. On Sunday, June 14, 1942 with 800 persons in attendance, Archbishop James Hugh Ryan dedicated the new church. The total cost of the building was approximately $140,000.Evening World Herald, Omaha, NE, \\"St. Margaret Mary's Church Hold Dedication Ceremony\\" June 15, 1942 Throughout his tenure as pastor, Father Suneg's leadership and vision seamlessly balanced such historical continuity with evolving liturgical functionality. For example, original 1941 Pre-Vatican II interior layout design features such as the chancel sanctuary with high altar and altar rails have been retained with the addition of a versus populum altar installed by Msgr. Suneg in the mid 1960s from a modified console table. Other examples of Father Suneg's original handicraft included the hand-hammered copper front doors and the mosaic backdrop behind the Mary statue in the bell tower chapel.Manhart, Nick (2019). ‚ÄúSt Margaret Mary Centennial 1919-2019‚Äù (1 ed.). Omaha, NE: Omaha World Herald Books. pp. 56‚Äì57.

At 4pm on Sunday, January 6, 1963, Archbishop Gerald Thomas Bergan led the dedication of the Leo A Daly designed tower and the new chapel at its base. The $200,000 addition had been completed the previous spring. The chapel is a memorial to William Foxley and the tower a memorial to Daniel J. Gross.Evening World Herald, Omaha, NE, \\"Bell Tower Dedication at St. Margaret Mary\\" January 5, 1963 The tower holds four bells. Bells number 2 and 3 were cast by Petit & Fritsen of Holland and paid for by Dr. Joseph Pleiss as a memorial to his wife Ida M. Pleiss. Bells number 1 and 4 were cast by McShane Bell Foundry of Baltimore. The 6,052 lbs (tone B‚ô≠) McShane bell was acquired by Msgr. Suneg in 1962 from Immaculate Conception parish in Leavenworth, Kansas. It was commissioned in 1885 by the first bishop of the Diocese of Leavenworth, Louis Mary Fink O.S.B. as a gift to the recently constructed Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, which stood on that site since 1868. By 1947, the Diocese of Leavenworth was suppressed and assumed into the larger Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas. And following a 1961 fire that destroyed the Cathedral, the parish no longer needed the large bell when a new, smaller church was constructed. Msgr. Suneg paid $3,600 \\"The Old Cathedral Parish 1855-1977, See of the Former Diocese of Leavenworth\\" by William J McEvoy, p55, 1977 for the bell which was installed with the others in 1965. Throughout his life, from his seminary days at the Josephinum through retirement at Marianna,Magazine of the Midlands, The Omaha World Herald, \\"Retirement to the Woodlands\\" pp.6-8, March 4, 1973 Suneg was known for his native artistic ability and craftsmanship. St. Margaret Mary parish in Omaha today stands as a lasting memorial to his priestly zeal and artistry.  Later years  In official recognition of his valuable service to the growth of the Catholic Church in Omaha, in 1957 Suneg was elevated to the title of Monsignor, a Domestic Prelate of Pope Pius XII. In 1969 Suneg retired to Marianna‚Äîa wooded retreat of 160 acres he founded near Cedar Bluffs, Nebraska in the 1930s. He decided he would share his property with other retired priests throughout the country and invited interested priests to build homes at his country retreat. Creighton University bestowed Suneg with the Honorary Alumnus Citation on January 29, 1970. He was recognized as the \\"father\\" of one of Omaha's largest parishes (1,500 families), having supervised the construction and development of both church and school from the ground up. During his tenure as pastor of St. Margaret Mary, Monsignor Suneg devoted many years of service to the Building Board of the Omaha Archdiocese. After 46 years of pastoral responsibilities, he continued to labor on behalf of the priests of the Archdiocese of Omaha. Less than one year before his death, during a June 1988 interview looking back on his long and fruitful priesthood, Monsignor Suneg remarked, \\"The sacrifice of the mass is the biggest thing in my life. There is nothing else to take its place.\\"  Death  Monsignor Joseph A. Suneg died on Sunday, May 21, 1989 at Merrick Manor in Fremont, Nebraska. He was 91. Suneg had been hospitalized since November 1988. The apparent cause of death was congestive heart failure and pneumonia, said the Rev. Tom Magnuson, assistant pastor of St. Patrick Church in Fremont.Obituary, Omaha World Herald, May 22, 1989 He is interred at Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Omaha.

Carlin (born June 25, 1950) is a Professor Emerita of Communication at Saint Louis University. She is known for her work centering on debate communication, specifically her focus on political debates. Carlin has authored several scholarly articles, and has co-authored several books, including her most recent, Gender and the American Presidency: Nine Presidential Women and the Barriers They Faced. Carlin has also been featured in The New York Times regarding the value of debate. Carlin views presidential debates as valuable due to their ability to summarize a candidates platform, put both candidates on display at once, and show how candidates respond to unexpected or difficult questions when unprepared.  Focus of Research  Much of Carlin's research looks at politics and the role that communication plays in it. Many of her articles concern practices used in presidential debates. She has participated in research looking at perceptions and reactions to Presidential debates during campaigns from 1992 to 2008. Carlin was the lead author on The Third Agenda in U.S. Presidential Debates: DebateWatch and Viewer Reactions, 1996-2004, which looked at viewer feedback of the 1996, 2000, and 2004 debates, and examined how the feedback could have affected candidate performance. She has also coauthored textbooks on debate communication and public speaking for educational use. Carlin also examines gender with an attempt to understand the biases and issues that it causes in politics. Of note is her research that considers gender's influence in Presidential campaign coverage. A popular article that she co-authored with Kelly Winfrey of the University of Kansas, \\"Have You Come a Long Way, Baby? Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin, and Sexism in 2008 Campaign Coverage\\" looks at the sexism and stereotypes that were present in the 2008 election. The article found that sexism targeted both Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin, with Clinton receiving criticism for her stern demeanor and age, and Palin being thought of largely as a cheerleader for John McCain. The article concluded that society needs to attack this sexism head on, and that the media needs to be more aware of the sexism present in their information distribution. Carlin has also co- authored the book, Gender and the American Presidency: Nine Presidential Women and the Barriers They Faced. The book looks at multiple women that the authors deemed possible Presidential contenders and examines the reasons that they struggled to achieve the status.

Six people were killed and twenty seven were seriously injured. The driver of the vehicle, Dimitrious Gargasoulas, who was in a drug-induced psychosis, was subsequently found guilty of six counts of murder and was sentenced to life in prison with a non-parole period of 46 years. Background The maroon Holden Commodore VS sedan used in the attack was stolen from his mother‚Äôs partner who lived in the same block of flats as Gargasoulas. Upon being interviewed, the car owner alleged that on the night of 18 January 2017, Gargasoulas entered his flat with a Bible, sat down, started burning it and threw it into his face. After this, he said that he flicked it on the floor and was then punched by Gargasoulas. In the early hours of 20 January 2017, Gargasoulas used the drug ice at his mother's flat in Windsor and then attacked his brother in the street stabbing him in the head and chest with a knife leaving him in a critical condition.\\"Bourke Street driver identified as James 'Jimmy' Gargasoulas\\", Tammy Mills, Beau Donelly and Chris Vedelago, The Age, 20 January 2017. He later took his pregnant girlfriend hostage; she was later released on the Bolte Bridge. Attack Gargasoulas was captured on footage driving and behaving erratically at the intersection of Flinders Street, St Kilda Road and Swanston Street, outside the entrance to Flinders Street railway station. Two men, Year 12 student Tevita Mahina and his cousin Isaac Tupou, attempted to stop him, hitting the windscreen with a baseball bat. The driver continued northbound up Swanston St's western-side footpath at speed towards the Bourke Street Mall, turned left onto Bourke Street's southern-side footpath and struck more than 20 pedestrians. The vehicle was stopped near AMP Square at 555 Bourke Street by a combination of mechanical failure and from being rammed by the Victoria Police Critical Incident Response Team. Police officers tasered and shot the driver in the arm during his arrest. A child and two adults died at the scene, another man died in hospital before the end of the day, and a three-month-old baby boy died the evening after the attack. A sixth person died on 30 January. Victims Floral tributes to victims of the attack at a memorial at the Western end of the Bourke Street Mall. Among the victims was a 10-year-old girl, who died on 20 January 2017, as well as a three-month-old baby boy who died on 21 January. The others were a 25-year-old man, a 22-year-old woman, a 33-year-old man, and a 33-year-old woman. A memorial for the victims was held in Federation Square on 23 January and floral tributes were left by members of the public at nine locations along the Bourke Street Mall. On 30 January it was announced that a permanent memorial garden would be established, and that donations approaching AU$1,000,000 had been made to the Bourke Street Fund for the families of the victims. On 31 January, the inorganic tributes were removed from the mall for storage by the Melbourne City Council and the floral tributes taken for composting for the Victims of Crime memorial near State Parliament. Perpetrator Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton confirmed that 26-year-old Dimitrious \\"Jimmy\\" Gargasoulas had previously been remanded into custody and was known to police for having a history of illicit drug use, family violence, and mental health problems. In the days before the attack, Gargasoulas began to post messages on Facebook about \\"religion, God, Satan, heaven and hell\\", which writers for The Age described as \\"rambling and often nonsensical\\". According to the Daily Express and Greece based TornosNews.gr, the perpetrator is an Australian citizen of Greek-Tongan descent.

This raised the death toll to six. Another murder charge was laid against Gargasoulas. Responses Police The Royal Children's Hospital treated many children injured in the attack Police urged eyewitnesses to provide a witness statement and collaborated with over 300 witnesses. Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton was quick to dismiss claims the attack was an act of terror and said it was related to a stabbing incident earlier that day which had developed into a crime spree. Victoria Police maintained religion was not a significant motivation. In an interview the day after the attack, Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Andrew Crisp, stated that police were hoping to interview and charge the suspect later in the day. He said that the fact that the suspect had been out on bail would be looked into by police. He congratulated everyone who dealt with the situation, stating \\"We saw the best of people yesterday. The support they gave to people on the street, it was amazing.\\"\\"Four killed, 30 injured after car mows down pedestrians in Melbourne\\", Helen Davidson, Calla Wahlquist and agencies, The Guardian, 21 January 2017. On 28 October 2019, Victoria Police announced a \\"hostile vehicle\\" policy - the first of its kind in Australia - which permits officers to use all tactical options to stop a car attack, including roadblocks, ramming an offending vehicle, boxing the vehicle in or, as a last resort, shooting an offender. The Crimes Act 1958 had been amended in 2018 to clarify the use of pre-emptive lethal force. Politicians Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull offered his prayers and deepest sympathies to the victims of the attack and their families. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews stated that \\"this was a terrible crime ‚Äì a senseless, evil act\\" and promised that \\"justice will be done\\". The Victorian Government established a fund to provide financial assistance for the families of the deceased, and made an initial donation of $100,000.\\"The Bourke Street Fund\\", State Government of Victoria. Within days of the incident, it was announced that a review of Victoria's bail laws would be undertaken and that the Magistrates' Court would introduce a Night Court to hear bail requests over weekends and after hours. In February 2017, the Magistrates' Court established a Night Court at the Melbourne Magistrates' Court operating between the hours of 5pm to 9pm seven days a week to hear Melbourne metropolitan bail and remand cases. Following a review by Paul Coghlan QC in 2017, the Bail Act 1977 was amended in 2018 to make it harder for serious and violent offenders to be granted bail, to provide senior police officers with the power to remand a person in custody for up to 48 hours and to revise the test for determining whether to grant bail. Criminal trial On Monday 23 January, Gargasoulas was interviewed by the Homicide Squad and subsequently charged with five counts of murder at the Melbourne Magistrates' Court. His defence lawyer advised the court he was too unwell to be present in the court room with the Magistrate excusing him from having to be present for future hearings due to his health and remanded him custody. In April and May 2017, at the Melbourne Magistrates' Court, Gargasoulas made claims including that \\"Muslim faith is the correct faith according to the whole world,\\" \\"I am the saviour,\\" \\"I was under extreme stress, which caused me to have a mental breakdown,\\" \\"[L]ife is being controlled by the government,\\" and \\"I'm very saddened by everything that's happened, but it's due to the Illuminati.\\" In December 2017, Gargasoulas pleaded not guilty to 39 charges, including six counts of murder, and waived his right to a committal hearing in the Magistrates' Court and was therefore committed to stand trial in the Supreme Court. In March 2018, Gargasoulas pleaded not guilty to all charges in the Supreme Court. His defence lawyers made a submission that given his current mental state he was unfit to stand trial and advised the court that they were awaiting further medical reports. Justice Lasry criticised the three month delay in holding a hearing to determine his fitness. In June 2018, a Supreme Court jury was empaneled to decide if Gargasoulas was fit to stand trial. In October 2018, the Supreme Court jury found Gargasoulas was fit to stand trial despite being diagnosed a paranoid schizophrenic. In November 2018, Gargasoulas was found guilty of six counts of murder and 27 counts of reckless conduct endangering life. Medical experts were of the opinion that on the day of the offence he was suffering from a drug-induced psychosis with paranoid delusional beliefs and was found to have Amphetamine type substances, Barbiturates and Benzodiazepines in his system. However, he was still aware of his actions and the consequences, that it would be considered to be wrongful and that he had the ability to skilfully avoid fixed obstacles whilst driving. Justice Weinberg found that he developed paranoid schizophrenia subsequent to the offence. Coronial Inquest On 21 January 2017, the State Coroner announced an inquest would be held which would investigate the decision to release Gargasoulas on bail, his conduct prior to the incident, his previous involvement with police and the police pursuit. In July 2017, as preparation was underway to hold an inquest, the Coroner adjourned the inquest until the conclusion of the criminal trial following a submission from Counsel Assisting the Coroner that to hold an inquest would create a risk of \\"compromising the criminal proceedings and the rights of the accused to a fair trial\\". In April 2019, inquest preparation recommenced with the holding of a directions hearing.

The group promotes collaborative fiction writing through workshops, public lectures, and the internet. Members Alice Campion consists of four core members: Denise Tart, a Sydney civil celebrant with a background in writing and performance; Jane Richards, a senior travel editor with Australian media group Fairfax; Jane St Vincent Welch (full name Mary Jane St Vincent Welch), an Australian film editor; and Jenny Crocker, a communications manager specialising in behaviour change campaigns. For its first novel, the Alice Campion group also included Madeline Oliver. Origins The Alice Campion collaborators met as members of an inner-city book club in Sydney, Australia, The Book Sluts. In 2010, while discussing Crime and Punishment, five members of the group decided spontaneously to write a ‚Äòbestseller‚Äô in order to fund a trip to Russia. What began as a light-hearted attempt to write a run-of-the-mill romance soon developed into a more serious attempt to write a quality genre novel. The group was also motivated by the lack of collaborative writing in commercial fiction. While other forms of creative writing ‚Äì notably screenwriting for television and movies ‚Äì thrived on collaboration, multi-author novels were rare, and the few that did exist were experimental, avant garde works, such as Wu Ming, or spoofs. Other successful collaborative pairs writing commercial Australian literature include Thomas Kenneally and his daughter Meg Kenneally as well as Florence James and Dymphna Cusack, who wrote the classic Australian novel Come In Spinner. Alice Campion remains the only multi-member commercial fiction group collaboration in the world. Writing process The Alice Campion authors, as Group Fiction, have outlined their writing process in detail and with examples of key documents in their e-book How to Write Fiction as a Group. Generally, the group meets on a Sunday to develop the plot of the book. This involves breaking the existing story into short scenes of around two to four pages. The group collaboratively decides what will happen in each scene: the action, setting the point of view, impacts on the emotion and knowledge of the participating character and the tone. Each writer then takes a single scene away and writes it as a draft. Scenes must be written and circulated to the other writers ahead of the next meeting, which generally takes place on a Thursday. At this Revision Meeting, each writer reads her own scene out loud and other participants have an opportunity to suggest improvements, which are integrated or not by agreement. In subsequent drafts, scenes are re-written by someone other than the original author and edited collaboratively to ensure a smooth and seamless narrative. Disagreements are decided by a vote.

Claude Carlier (7 September 1725 ‚Äì 25 April 1787), called the Abb√© Carlier, was a French religious, historian and agronomist. He was the prior of Andr√©sy and pr√©v√¥t royal (royal provost) of the ch√¢tellenie (castellany) of Verberie, where he was born and died. Carlier came to public notice when he participated in a contest held by the and sponsored by the intendant of finances Daniel-Charles Trudaine between 1752 and 1754. The contest asked whether France could do without foreign wool, and how French wool production could be improved in both quality and quantity. Carlier had a deep knowledge of sheep breeding, the fleece trade and the different kinds of wool produced by different sheep breeds. He won the contest with an essay arguing that Spanish and English breeds produced better wool. A few years later, the controller-general of finances, Henri Bertin, hired Carlier as a consultant-propagandist tasked with promoting new breeds of sheep and new shepherding practices.Jeremy L. Caradonna, The Enlightenment in Practice: Academic Prize Contests and Intellectual Culture in France, 1670‚Äì1794 (Cornell University Press, 2012), pp. 192‚Äì93. In 1762, Carlier published Considerations on the Means of Re- establishing in France Good Species of Wool Sheep and Bertin distributed copies to agricultural societies throughout France. In 1763, when Bertin turned his attention to Flemish sheep, Carlier produced a book on the subject, Instruction in the Manner of Raising and Perfecting the Good Species of Wool Sheep in Flanders. This book was highly influential in the subsequent adoption of Flemish breeds throughout France. Carlier was then tasked with producing a questionnaire to be sent to all the regions of France on breeding practices. This elicited over 300 responses. Carlier himself synthesised the data in a two-volume publication in 1770, Treaty on Wool Sheep, or a Method of Raising and Perfecting the Herds in the Fields and the Sheepfold, a Practical Work. Carlier wrote an important history of the County and Duchy of Valois.

Industrial pig farming, a subset of concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), poses numerous threats to the environment. CAFOs house thousands of swine and other farm animals in confined areas, where feces and waste often spread to surrounding neighborhoods, polluting air and water with toxic waste particles. Waste from these farms have the potential to carry pathogens, bacteria (often antibiotic resistant), and heavy metals that can be toxic when ingested. Pig waste also contributes to groundwater pollution in the forms of groundwater seepage and waste spray, which is essentially the usage of a sprinkler to spray vats of pig waste into neighboring areas. The contents in the spray and waste drift have been shown to cause mucosal irritation, respiratory ailment, increased stress, decreased quality of life, and higher blood pressure. This improper way to get rid of waste is an attempt for CAFOs to be cost efficient. This presents an environmental injustice problem, since the communities do not receive any benefit from the operations, and instead, suffer negative externalities, such as pollution and health problems. The Agriculture and Consumer Health Department has stated explicitly that the \\"main direct environmental impact of pig production is related to the manure produced.  North Carolina  In 2014, National Geographic wrote a piece on the extent of the contamination in North Carolina. Swine sales in the state (second largest pork producer in the nation) were nearly $3 billion in 2012, and the state received attention in 1999 when Hurricane Floyd caused waste pods on the swine ponds to overflow, polluting the water supply. National Geographic suggested that despite the execution of a $17 million research project on waste in the area, no one in the state seemed to know what to do with the pig waste, which was a huge issue considering that there are nearly as many pigs as people. Nearly two decades later when Hurricane Florence hit the coast of North Carolina in 2018, hog waste remained a major concern. According to the NC Pork Council, 98% of hog lagoons experienced minimal impact. The NC Department of Environmental Quality identified six hog farms with anaerobic lagoons that suffered structural damage and 28 farms that had lagoons overflow due to the floodwater.  Effects on water quality  A typical waste lagoon in North Carolina. Many of these CAFOS store the swine waste in giant vats often referred to as lagoons. These lagoons often contain pathogens such as salmonella, pharmaceuticals like antibiotics and antimicrobials, as well as nitrogen and phosphorus. This can lead to widespread pollution within the watershed that the CAFO is located within, if the water from these lagoons leaches out into the soil and trickles down into the water table beneath.Impacts of waste from concentrated animal feeding operations on water quality. Burkholder J, Libra B, Weyer P, Heathcote S, Kolpin D, Thorne PS, Wichman M Environ Health Perspect. 2007 Feb; 115(2):308-12. Unlike human sewage, which is always treated with chemical and mechanical filtration, the waste from these lagoons is untreated when it is released back to the environment. Spills are the most common contributor to pollution, but regardless of spills, toxic nutrients like nitrates and ammonia can seep into the water table located just below the surface, infecting the groundwater that nearby communities drink. Warrick J, Stith P. New studies show that lagoons are leaking: groundwater, rivers affected by waste. Raleigh News & Observer (19 Feb 1995) It has been estimated that 35,000 miles of river across over 20 states has been contaminated by manure leakage. Some of the causes for the environmental problems are inadequate sewage treatment and lack of developing technologies. Many farms lack adequate wastewater treatment systems, which release untreated wastewater to release into the environment in the form of contamination. Some spills and leakage of contaminated waste are not accidental. In 2014, Mark Devries used spy drones to expose pig farms in North Carolina that were spraying untreated fecal waste into the surrounding areas, allowing the waste to dissipate into far-off communities. Smithfield Foods, the company responsible for one such factory, claimed this was a tactic used to fertilize its fields. It is true that historically hog feces have been used as fertilizer and can be done safely and without runoff, but the magnitude was described by Dan Whittle, a former senior policy associate at the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources, as a \\"mass imbalance\\", with far too great a magnitude of fecal matter being sprayed for the crops being generated to not have significant spill off into neighboring plots of land. Many residents of the surrounding areas of such farms complain that the industrially concentrated fecal matter creates an unbearable odor of a different magnitude than typical farm manure. Charlotte Savage, a resident who lives on a property separated from the Smithfield farm by an 80-foot path of forest, reported seeing her husband Julian faint at one point due to the smell, and that their house was also once surrounded by a three foot deep puddle of fecal matter. This was described as a common occurrence in this community and many others.  Effects on air quality  Communities located near CAFOs experience negative health and environmental effects due to several factors associated with industrial pig farming. One main issue that arises out of intensive animal agriculture is the waste that the huge number of animals in a small space produce. In the pig farming industry, there are huge amounts of waste and farmers are pressed to find somewhere to put it and dispose of it. Pig waste is similar to human waste; filled with bacteria and high amounts of ammonia. At most CAFOs, hog waste is kept in large open-air pits called lagoons where waste is broken down by anaerobic bacteria and then sprayed onto crops as fertilizer. This is called the lagoon and sprayfield system and remains legal in the United States, including in states like North Carolina where there have been on-going efforts in the NC legislature to ban open-air lagoon and sprayfield system practices in the state and replace these with more environmentally-sound waste management practices. The waste then reaches neighboring towns, resulting in civilians not being able to even leave their house in order to avoid pig waste filled air. People living in nearby towns have suffered a variety of adverse health effects including respiratory diseases, infections, increased risk of cancer, and other health risks. The excessive amounts of nitrogen from the waste can also contribute to acid rain in the local areas; team of scientists from the US Agricultural Research Service and the US Department of the Environment has examined and noted that within wastewater lagoons in North and South Carolina, there are a host of genes involved in the process of turning ammonia into nitrogen. One case study, conducted by Environmental Health Perspectives, sought to prove that malodor and pollutant concentrations from swine operations are associated with stress, altered mood, and increased blood pressure. For two weeks, adult volunteers living near swine operations in North Carolina sat outside for ten minutes twice a day. They reported levels of hog odor, and recorded their blood pressure. The study found that like noise and other similar environmental stressors, the malodors from the swine operations were likely associated with an increase in blood pressure, which could contribute to an increase in chronic hypertension. Disease spread There are many documented incidences of disease outbreaks occurring due to the presence of pig farms in a given community, particularly industrial pig farms. MRSA (Methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus, a type of anti-biotic resistant bacteria) outbreaks have been correlated to an individual working in a pig farm, likely attributed to the strong antibiotics often used in industrialized pig farms. Other diseases can also spread in pig farms such as Salmonella, Toxoplasma, and Campylobacter. Granted that many of these diseases are preventable given proper safety precautions such as washing hands and clothes, wearing face masks, and covering any open wounds when coming into contact with pigs, but many improvements could be made to educate farmers on how to protect themselves. Improvements in these areas are often cited as the reason for the lack of increase in disease outbreaks in North Carolina despite an increase in pig population by a factor of four in the years leading up to 1998. In order to prevent disease spread in the community as well, citizens in nearby towns as well as farmers must be educated and equipped with the proper tools and resources to protect themselves from the spread of fecal matter and associated diseases. Policy implications In the 1970s, a series of laws, known as \\"Murphy's Laws\\", were passed in North Carolina to eliminate the sales tax on hog farm equipment and to prevent authorities from using authority to prevent and address odor issues.Stith P, Warrick J. Murphy‚Äôs laws: for Murphy, good government means good business. Raleigh News & Observer (22 Feb 1995). Available After the passage of Murphy‚Äôs Laws and other similar bills, there was a rapid increase in industry in North Carolina, where the population of swine was estimated around 9-10 million.NCDACS. 2012 North Carolina Agricultural Statistics. Raleigh, NC:North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services/National Agricultural Statistics Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture (2012). Each of those hogs produces eight times the feces as a human, causing a crucial need for regulation and maintenance for that waste.Edwards B, Driscoll A. From farms to factories: the environmental consequences of swine industrialization in North Carolina, 1982‚Äì2007. In: Twenty Lessons in Environmental Sociology (Gould K, Lewis T, eds.). New York, NY:Oxford University Press (2008) Regulation and laws could not keep up with the rapid explosion of the hog farming and spread of CAFOs in the early 2000s, which has caused severe harm and health impacts over time. Furthermore, agencies with jurisdiction over CAFOs are typically environmental or natural resource state-run agencies, as opposed to local health departments. This is an advantage for addressing environmental impacts but a disadvantage for human health concerns, as the majority of local health issues get overlooked by state-run agencies.Investigating the role of state and local health departments in addressing public health concerns related to industrial food animal production sites. Fry JP, Laestadius LI, Grechis C, Nachman KE, Neff RA PLoS One. 2013; 8(1):e54720. Additionally, although there are laws and regulations in place, such as the Swine Farm Environmental Performance Standards Act, which prohibits new waste lagoons and mandates that new CAFOs must use technology that will prevent discharge of waste, these regulations do not mandate for existing CAFOs to clean up or regulate the pollutants within their lagoons.General Assembly of North Carolina. House DRH30306-SB-6: Swine Farm Env. Performance Standards/Funds. Effective 1 Jul 2007 and 1 Sept 2007 These regulations also make it more costly to clean up these wastes and prevent other consequential harms, without actually assisting farms in shouldering these costs, making it difficult for them to actually act on these regulations. Ag-gag laws have made it even more difficult for farms to be held accountable for their actions, and for communities to have a transparent view of farm operations. These laws forbid the undercover video-taping or documenting of farms without the consent of the farm's owner. These laws are targeted at keeping animal rights and environmental activists away from the most damaging farm operations. These laws emerged in the 90's and are now in effect in North Carolina, Utah, Missouri, Idaho, and Iowa, and is being considered in at least five states. These bills have the potential to exacerbate animal abuse on these large scale farms and CAFOs, as well as threaten community health, social justice, and consumer health by restricting organizations and individuals from sharing pertinent information about the food supply. The EPA does require that operations with qualified number of pigs must demonstrate that there is no runoff from their farm, in order for them to acquire a permit. But, this regulation varies from state to state and most of the time, enforcement only happens in response to citizen complaints, rather than active monitoring. Further, locally developed policies often have inefficient resources and abilities to enforce regulation, and often don't address transboundary issues that arise with pig operations that exist across multiple states. And with Federal laws such as the Clean Water and Clean Air act, regulation is delegated to state agencies, but these agencies don't usually take on active regulation until the damage has been done. Further, many operations are exempt because they have been grandfathered in, meaning they have been in operation for so long that they are not subject to the new laws.

This election, alongside other local and mayoral elections across England and Wales, was originally scheduled to take place on 7 May 2020, but was delayed by the UK Government on 13 March 2020 due to the unfolding COVID-19 pandemic. The election will take place the same day as council elections within the city-region, including the election for the mayor of Salford, as well as elections across England and Wales. It will be the second election to the position of mayor. It will use the supplementary vote as its electoral system.  Background  The mayor of Greater Manchester serves as the directly elected leader of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority. The mayor has power over investment directly to the combined authority from the government of ¬£30 million a year for 30 years from 2017. The mayor also incorporates the Police and Crime Commissioner role of the Greater Manchester Police into the post. In addition to these, the mayor has authority over strategic housing planning, transport, adult education and skills, social care and others. The first election for the role was held in 2017, Labour candidate Andy Burnham won with 63% of the vote in the first round. As a result of the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the United Kingdom the government announced on the 13 March 2020 that it would postpone the mayoral election, along with all other scheduled local government elections across the UK, for one year. The Coronavirus Act 2020 received royal assent 12 days later on the 25 March 2020 giving legal effect to the government's announcement. This was the first such postponement of elections since the foot-and-mouth outbreak caused a one-month delay of the 2001 local elections.  Events prior to the election  In August, Burnham and the Mayor of Liverpool City Region Steve Rotherham pushed the government to pay workers asked to self-isolate by the contact tracing system during the COVID-19 pandemic, Burnham had also used the Mayors and Combined Authority resources to run a local contact tracing system where the national system had deficits. As the pandemic entered a period of increase in the Autumn the British government created a three tiered system for what local social and economic restrictions would be implemented. Greater Manchester was initially placed at tier 2 restrictions, however the government went into talks with the Mayor and the council leaders to put Greater Manchester into tier 3 restrictions. Burnham cited inadequate financial support for businesses and workers in the city-region- he stated he preferred a short, nation-wide lockdown known as a \\"circuit breaker\\".  Electoral system  The election will use a supplementary vote system, in which voters express a first and a second preference for candidates. * If a candidate receives more than 50% of the first preference vote, that candidate wins. * If no candidate receives more than 50% of first preference votes, the top two candidates proceed to a second round and all other candidates are eliminated. * The first preference votes for the remaining two candidates stand in the final count. * Voters' ballots whose first and second preference candidates are eliminated are discarded. * Voters whose first preference candidates have been eliminated and whose second preference candidate is one of the top two have their second preference votes added to that candidate's count. This means that the winning candidate has the support of a majority of voters who expressed a preference among the top two. All registered electors (British, Irish, Commonwealth and European Union citizens) living in Greater Manchester aged 18 or over on 7 May 2020 will be entitled to vote in the mayoral election. Those who are temporarily away from Greater Manchester (for example, away working, on holiday, in student accommodation or in hospital) will also be entitled to vote in the mayoral election. The deadline to register to vote in the election will be announced nearer the election. Candidates Conservative Party Laura Evans, a former Trafford councillor and parliamentary candidate, was selected as the Conservative candidate in February 2020. As an executive member on Trafford Council, Evans received the 'Employer Supported Policing Award' for generous changes to officers' paid leave and, in 2014, received a Hero's award for community work. Labour Party Andy Burnham, the incumbent mayor and former shadow home secretary, announced his intention to seek re-election as mayor of Greater Manchester for the Labour Party in January 2020. Liberal Democrats Andy Kelly, councillor and leader of the Liberal Democrats group in Rochdale, was confirmed as the first Liberal Democrat candidate on 17 August 2019 following a vote by Liberal Democrat members in Greater Manchester. However, on 11 August 2020 Kelly stood down, stating that the delay in the election for a year has impacted his employment. Other candidates *Melanie Horrocks was selected as the Green Party candidate in 2019. *Michael Elston is standing as an independent.  Campaign  The incumbent mayor Andy Burnham pledged to take the bus services of Greater Manchester into public ownership, establish an integrated ticket system for all buses and Metrolink trams, make the city-region carbon neutral by 2038 and build 30,000 social homes over the next decade. The BBC has noted that should the metro mayor take the buses back into public ownership it would be the first place outside of London to do so. Laura Evans is critical of Burnham's plans to build on sparser parts of the city-region and the implementation of a Clean Air Zone.

Parker Four-Row Park Carousel, is a carousel formerly installed at Portland, Oregon's Jantzen Beach, in the United States. History The carousel was built circa 1904 by C. W. Parker in Abilene, Kansas, for use at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. It was later moved to Venice Beach, California, where it began operating in 1921. In 1928, the carousel was repossessed and its parts were relocated to Portland for the opening of Jantzen Beach Amusement Park. Since then, the park became a shopping mall, Jantzen Beach Center. The carousel was removed during the mall's $50 million renovation in 2012, and reportedly remains in storage on site. In 1987, the carousel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, along with four others. However, it was delisted in 2008 because of plans for relocation to the Portland Children's Museum, which never came to fruition. The carousel has been designated \\"endangered\\" by the Architectural Heritage Center. In 2012, it was included in the Historic Preservation League of Oregon's list of Oregon's Most Endangered Places. 2015 sale and restoration In 2015, the mall's owner, a company called Edens, said the carousel was being \\"safely stored in a camera-monitored, climate-controlled\\" building at the shopping center. However, in early 2017, The Oregonian reported that the current owner and location of the carousel were unknown; Edens said the carousel was sold to Kimco Realty, while the latter company claimed its purchase of Jantzen Beach Center included the land and buildings, but not the carousel. On September 7, 2017, it was made public that the carousel had been donated in spring 2017 to Restore Oregon, a nonprofit organization; the donation had been kept private until the transfer was complete.

Where applicable, native rulers are also listed. For the purposes of this list, a current dependency is any entity listed on these lists of dependent territories and other entities. A dependent territory is normally a territory that does not possess full political independence or sovereignty as a sovereign state yet remains politically outside of the controlling state's integral area. This latter condition distinguishes a dependent territory from an autonomous region or administrative division, which forms an integral part of the 'parent' state. The administrators of uninhabited territories are excluded.

He has fallen for a wealthy rancher's wife who is used to living in luxury. Unfortunately this woman has devious motives. She tells him to prove his manhood by stealing the payroll intended for the railroad gang. Manipulated by her, he obeys her request and steals the money. Sadly he meets a tragic end before he can go with her to Mexico.

The series made its debut on TVOKids in English, as well as Ici Radio-Canada T√©l√© in French. It debuted in the United States on Qubo in October 2019. The series focuses on a 7-year-old boy named Jerry, whose life spins comically out of control when his two galactic raider action figures, Bakko and Gant (known together as The Raiders), magically spring to life. The Raiders are hyper-curious about nearly everything around them, and thus treat every moment as one big adventure. This often leads to Jerry and his 4-year- old sister Nicole, into a series of household disasters, in which Jerry often cleans up after their mess in solving the everyday mysteries that The Raiders stumble upon. The show is primarily aimed at children ages 4‚Äì8.  Premise  To commemorate Jerry's 7th birthday, he is given a pair of boxed action figures, known as Galactic Raiders. Jerry, utterly disappointed with his gifts, opts to not open them, and decides to stash them up onto his head board where he would later have intended to put them into the give-away box. Later that night, a dripping sound was heard from down the hallway, and the Galactic Raiders, Bakko and Gant, magically spring to life and break free from their packaging. In attempting to discover the mystery of this sound, the Raiders using their gadgets to navigate Jerry's room, frantically make enough noise to wake him up. Early on, Jerry is convinced that he is dreaming when he sees his action figures come to life, but once Nicole discovers them, he is ultimately faced with the truth that his toys are special, and that neither his parents nor his friends can find out about them. Every episode challenges Jerry with daunting children's tasks, from school assignments to chores, as well as one's everyday life activities, from taking care of an animal to playing safely. The Raiders' minds are boggled by these activities, and immediately treat them as some sort of great mystery, or often as a ferocious villain set to take over their neighborhood. Jerry, Nicole and the Raiders pull through each challenge and discover new and interesting things than happen around them, solidifying that things are not always as they appear to be, and simple everyday things always turn out amazing.

Son of hockey great Patrick Roy, he initially pursued hockey in junior leagues, but abandoned that path in favour of music while still a teenager. Having previously released three albums, his major-label debut, Mr. Optimist Blues, was released in 2017, and includes several songs written by 1980s pop star Corey Hart.  Early life  Roy's father is famed Montreal Canadiens goaltender Patrick Roy. He moved with his family from Montreal to Colorado when he was six years old, due to his father being traded. Roy was influenced by his mother's frequent piano playing for the family as he was growing up. He wrote poetry from the age of 13 or 14, and began putting his poems to music around age 16. At age 17, Roy played hockey for the Quebec Remparts, with his father coaching the team at the time. Although he enjoyed goaltending, he dreamed of a music career, and was listening to the Backstreet Boys, John Mayer, and Ray LaMontagne. At 18, when his father told him that his future would not be in hockey and that he needed to plan an education, Roy told his father that he wanted to be a musician and songwriter. In 2009 Roy was charged with assault following an incident during a hockey brawl where he skated the length of the ice and attacked the opposing goaltender, punching him several times.  Music career  Roy's album What I've Become came out in 2009. His second album, Found My Way, came out in 2010. He released his French-language debut album, La route, in 2011. The title track, a duet with Natasha St-Pier, received the most attention. Roy had a critically acclaimed role in the 2012 revival of the musical Don Juan.Williams, John (December 1, 2015). \\"Jonathan Roy trades goalie stick for guitar\\", Toronto Sun. Retrieved September 5, 2017. In 2012, his father helped him set up a meeting with 1980s pop singer Corey Hart, who runs Siena Records, an affiliate of Warner Music. Hart offered to sign him to his label after Roy performed a Teddy Thompson song for him at Hart's home in Nassau, Bahamas. Roy and Hart had a hit holiday release in 2016 when they duetted on the Chris Rea song \\"Driving Home for Christmas\\". In 2017, Roy released the album Mr. Optimist Blues on Siena Records, Corey Hart's music label. Hart executive-produced the album, and wrote three of the album's songs. The Montreal Gazette's music critic characterizes the style as \\"easygoing 21st-century pop with a little light reggae thrown in for good measure. Think Ed Sheeran meets Paolo Nutini and then slap on Bob Marley‚Äôs greatest hits.\\" Roy is based in Toronto.

The station is located at the Maharlika Highway, Barangay San Felipe, Padre Garcia, Batangas and operates daily from 4:30 AM to 11:00 PM. Station history 2000s-2014: Dual affiliation and inactivity Radyo Natin Padre Garcia first went on the air on 105.5 FM as a dual affiliate of MBC and the Philippine branch of the Faith Broadcasting Network, heavily carrying religious programs during Radyo Natin's clearance for local programming and preempting the latter, except during news of utmost importance. The station was noted for occasional lengthy disclaimers from FBN disassociating its religious content from that of MBC's and American broadcasters who were already fluent with Filipino providing its program stingers and sermonettes. Due to lack of funding and frequency conflicts, the station was forced to close down by mid-2014. The frequency, however, alternated between distant feeds from Calapan City and Angeles City, Pampanga during the interregnum. Notably, DZRH's Henry Uri was the station's newscaster under this timeframe, with his tenure lasting from 2000 until his promotion to the main network in 2002. 2016-present; Revival and new investors In October 2016, investors led by veteran Lipa City disk jock Queenie Kinita resurrected the station on a test broadcast, this time as a full MBC-Radyo Natin station. In the latter months, the revived station recruited more personnel, including former CitiBeat 102.3 jocks and Batangas blocktimer Larry Karangalan. Faith Broadcasting Network remained with the station, albeit as a late-night block. In March 2017, veteran Batangas freelance journalist Ron Lozano joined the station, followed by DJ Banjo Valdemor five months later. Lozano left the station in March 2018 to concentrate as a stringer for CNN Philippines and has been an on air talent at 101.5 FM since October 1, 2018. Area of coverage Radyo Natin Padre Garcia covers the central-southern part of Batangas, with the eastern barangays of Batangas City as its southernmost limit, south-central Lipa to the north, and San Antonio, Quezon to the east. Frequency assignment conflicts The station was also beset with frequency assignment conflicts with Calapan City-based DWOM at 105.5 MHz in the early 2010s. The latter, broadcasting with a stronger 1 kW output constantly posed problems to the Padre Garcia station's southern broadcast range on the eastern parts of Batangas City as both signals overlapped. Furthering the dilemma was if the former moved to 105.3 FM, it could pose problems to Tayabas-licensed DZCT. That station, however moved to 97.5 FM in 2014 but the DCG-Radio TV Network later reactivated the old frequency as a repeater to its Manila flagship. The Tayabas repeater, however, was later shut down. On January 15, 2017, Radyo Natin Padre Garcia moved to 105.3 FM after years of broadcasting at 105.5 FM. However, on January 29, 2018, the station was forced to return to its former position as Tayabas City reocuppied 105.3 FM under the banner The Big 30K, Pakakak ng Bayan (lit. The Town's Trumpet), forcing DWOM to sign-off after sunset. News operation Radyo Natin Padre Garcia provides 7 and a half-hours of local news output through Kasangga ng Bayan with Larry Karangalan on the weekdays. National outputs are provided by the network feed.

The core sections were built in 1932 and extensions were added on in 1954 and 1962. The school closed in 2005. In 2008 the building reopened as the Franklin Arts Center, which leases residential, work, and commercial space to local artists. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009 for having local significance in the theme of architecture. It was nominated for reflecting the research-based national standards for middle school design as they evolved through the first half of the 20th century. Novel, early-century features apparent in the original section include large windows for maximum sunlight, an auditorium and gymnasium designed to accommodate large community events, and rooms for specialized instruction in music, science, and vocational training. The later sections show new preferences adopted after World War II, most noticeably smaller classroom windows and a reliance on artificial lighting. Description The historic core of Franklin Junior High School, built in 1932, resembles a stubby arrow. The two classroom wings meet at a right angle with a prominent, angled-off main entry facing southwest. Extending at a 45-degree angle to the northeast is a third wing containing the auditorium and gymnasium. New additions in 1954 extended all three wings, particularly the two classroom wings. A further expansion in 1962 extended the north wing, bringing the school's total floorspace from in its original configuration to about . The building has a brick and reinforced concrete structure. The exterior is dark red-brown brick with trim of smooth limestone quarried near Mankato, Minnesota. A belt course of stone trim extends continuously just under the ground floor windows. The second-floor windows have stone lintels. The building's primary fa√ßade is the southwest corner, which is angled at 45 degrees. The main entrance is set into a stone entryway featuring a segmental arch topped by a parapet and flanked by a pair of tall piers each sporting a bronze lantern. Large windows on the second floor are topped by a series of stone lancet arches supported by stone corbels. The roofline is defined by a brick parapet which sports a medallion of pattened bricks in the very center. Projecting stone bay windows define the fa√ßade's ground floor corners. The 1954 additions use brick and stone similar to the original section. An entry door in the middle of the west and south fa√ßades indicates the corners of the original construction. A recessed bay on the west fa√ßade with another entry door defines the start of the 1962 addition. Interior The front entrance leads into a ground level foyer with administrative offices to the side and stairs to the second floor. Beyond the foyer, where the building's three wings come together, is the school's 500-seat auditorium. The north and east wings contain classrooms on either side of central halls. The northeast wing extends behind the auditorium stage and contains a gymnasium as well as a basement- level cafeteria and boiler room. Directly over the main entrance, on the second floor, was the school library. The ground floor of one classroom wing housed industrial arts workshops for boys while the other offered home economics classes for girls. The gymnasium was also originally divided in two for sex-segregated instruction. Although the architectural style of the school's exterior is Collegiate Gothic, the interior has simple details in the Streamline Moderne mode popular in the early 1930s. The foyer is tiled, while there were terrazzo floors in the hallways and maple wood flooring in the classrooms and gym. The terrazzo continues in the hallways of the later additions, but the walls are covered in ceramic tile and the classrooms are floored with vinyl tile. History Education experts began promoting separate middle schools in the early 20th century as they began recognizing seventh and eighth grade as an important transitional period. Previously these grades were included in primary school but tended to be too focused on review of previously taught material and left students ill-prepared for the high school environment, leading to a high drop-out rate. When Brainerd's high school building was destroyed by fire in 1928, the city took the opportunity to propose building a middle school in addition to a new high school. Voters approved both projects when they appeared on the ballot. By the time the two contracts went up for bid, the Great Depression had set in and construction work was scarce (federal New Deal funding for building projects would not appear for another few years). 14 architectural firms competed for Brainerd's two school bids, and the commission went to Croft & Boerner of Minneapolis. Concerned about losing jobs to outsiders, a delegation of local craftsmen lobbied the Board of Education for the construction labor to be drawn from Brainerd residents. Croft and Boerner's design drew on the established best practices for American junior high schools. These favored H-, I-, or L-shaped layouts and flat roofs, fireproofing, large windows for natural light in classrooms, good air circulation, a well-stocked library, science laboratories, and specialized rooms for music, industrial, and vocational training. Auditoriums and gyms were often planned to serve the larger community as public event spaces. Croft and Boerner's design included an auditorium stage that could be opened up to the gymnasium behind it for additional seating. A growing student population led to expansion of the school in 1954. The design, by Minneapolis architect Hubert Swanson, once again reflected the latest standards, which had evolved since the 1930s. Most notable is a reversal in opinions about windows, driven in part by improvements in artificial lighting. Where maximum sunlight and air circulation had once been deemed essential, fluorescent lighting was now considered preferable and large windows a distraction. An increased emphasis on physical education prompted an expansion of the gymnasium and improvements to the sports field northeast of the school. A further addition to the north wing was designed by the Brainerd-based firm of Stengen, Hendrickson, and McNutt in 1962. Adaptive reuse By the 2000s Franklin Junior High School was getting too small again for its student body, but the state funds that had previously helped the city expand the existing building had been eliminated. Brainerd was obliged to build a new junior high, and Franklin closed in 2005. Hoping to find an adaptive reuse for Franklin, the school district contacted Artspace Projects, Inc, a national non-profit organization specializing in converting older buildings into art centers. Artspace formally purchased the building in 2008 and completed renovations later that year. Now known as the Franklin Arts Center, the building leases space to arts organizations and rents out residential and work studios to artists. The school district retains access to the auditorium, gymnasium, and athletic field for sports programs and community events. To preserve the building's historic feel, state rules forbid major alterations to the exterior or the hallways with their rows of lockers and built-in cabinets.

Shimon Graydi), 2nd edition, Jerusalem 1987, p. 30 (Preface) assuming this role in 1934, after the death of Rabbi Yihya al-Abyadh, Resh Methivta, and which role he held for approximately two years. He is the author of the book, Sa'arat Teman, published post-mortem by the author's son, a book that documents the history of the Jews of Yemen and their culture for a little over 250 years, from the Mawza exile to the mass- immigration of Yemenite Jews to Israel in the mid-20th century. Biography Amram Qorah was born in Sana'a, Yemen, as  øImrƒÅn Qera·∏•, the son of Yihya ben Shalom Qera·∏•. At the age of ten, he was orphaned of his father. As he grew to adulthood, he was active in the study of Jewish ritual and law, which soon qualified him to work as secretary of the rabbinic court under the Av Beit Din, Rabbi Suleiman Qareh. He was also given charge over the community's treasury known as heqdesh (monies raised for the poor of Sana'a), and served as the head of the Al-Kessar Synagogue in Sana'a. In time, after the death of Rabbi Yihya Yitzhak Halevi (d. 1932), he was appointed by the community to serve, alongside Rabbi Hayyim Mishreqi, as an assistant to Rabbi Yihya al- Abyadh, the Head of the Academy and the king's minter of coins, who had succeeded Rabbi Yihya Yitzhak as Chief Rabbi.Amram Qorah, Sa'arat Teman (2nd edition), Jerusalem 1987, pp. 75‚Äì76 (Hebrew) When Rabbi Yihya al-Abyadh died in late 1934 and the office of Chief Rabbi of Yemen was left vacant, Amram Qorah assumed the role of Chief Rabbi. However, after one year of serving in this capacity, Rabbi Qorah requested of the king ImƒÅm Ya·∏•yƒÅ ·∏§amƒ´d ad-Dƒ´n (1904‚Äî1948) that he be absolved of his duties, because of a raging dispute between members of the Jewish community over the acceptance or rejection of the Zohar, which request was granted him after he had served the community for two years. Still, Qorah agreed to partially act as arbitrator in the resolution of marital matters in his community, as also to continue to serve as one of the city's ritual slaughterers and one that checks defects in such animals.Yosef Tobi and Shalom Seri (ed.), Yalqut Teman - Lexicon of Yemenite Jewry, Tel-Aviv 2000, pp. 256‚Äì257 (Hebrew) He also served as the liaison in matters relating to the Jewish community in Yemen and the king, and in 1946 he served as the chief intermediary between the Jewish Agency (JDC) responsible for Jewish immigration and the Jewish community of Yemen. This position he held until his immigration to Israel in 1950, when an operation launched by the Jewish Agency known as On Eagle's Wings brought the vast majority of Yemen's remaining Jewish community to Israel. Qorah and his family arrived in the Land of Israel on the eve of Yom Kippur, where he settled in Jerusalem. In Jerusalem, he met with ethnographer and historian, Shelomo Dov Goitein, who interviewed him on several occasions. In 1934, Rabbi Qorah wrote a letter of recommendation for the book, Emmunat Hashem, published as a rebuttal to Rabbi Yihya Qafih's Mil·∏•amot HaShem (Wars of the Lord). In Qorah's latter years in Jerusalem, he tried to no avail to enlist the help of the rabbinate in supplying educators that would teach Yemenite school-children the preservation of their own unique Hebrew pronunciation in the schools. Like many new immigrants in the late 1940s and early 1950s, wooden crates of handwritten manuscripts and Torah scrolls were sent via ship in the port of Aden to a warehouse ran by the Jewish Agency in Jaffa. Amram Qorah, upon his arrival in the country in 1950, was told that the shipment of books he had sent to the country was burnt in a conflagration.Amram Qorah, Sa'arat Teman (2nd edition), Jerusalem 1987, p. 16, Introduction (in Hebrew) Later, some of these books and religious artifacts were discovered on sale in book shops, and one handwritten manuscript belonging to the family was seen by its owner at the British Museum in London. One of the grandsons of Rabbi Amram Qorah, Rabbi Shelomo Qorah, served as the Chief Sephardic Rabbi of Bnei Barak, until his death in 2018. Works Amram Qorah's opus magnum is Sa øarat Teman, a book that documents the history of Yemen's Jewry over a 250-year period, in which he drew upon the court records of Sana'a (al-Maswaddeh), and systematically names the chief rabbis who led the community from 1680‚Äì1902.Yehuda Ratzaby, Yemenite Jewish Literature (Authors and their Writings), Kiriat Ono 1995, p. 91 His other works include: * øAlmuth Shir (◊¢◊ú◊û◊ï◊™ ◊©◊ô◊®), a commentary on some 200 liturgical poems composed by poets Yosef ben Israel and Shalom Shabazi, first published in the ·∏§efetz ·∏§ayyim Diwan, Jerusalem in 1966.Yehuda Ratzaby, Yemenite Jewish Literature (Authors and their Writings), Kiriat Ono 1995, p. 92 *Neweh Shalom (◊†◊ï◊î ◊©◊ú◊ï◊ù), a commentary on difficult words contained in Saadia Gaon's Judeo- Arabic translations and commentaries of the Hebrew Bible, covering the Pentateuch, the Five Scrolls, Isaiah, the Book of Psalms, the Book of Proverbs and Daniel.Yehuda Ratzaby, Yemenite Jewish Literature (Authors and their Writings), Kiriat Ono 1995, p. 92 References External links * Sa'arat Teman, (ed.

Since 2017, Williams has been an Assistant Professor in the Department of Drama at the University of Alberta. Career Williams jokes he had the worst career path in Canadian theatre. He worked as an encyclopedia salesman on reserve, a bartender, a drummer and joined the Reservists. Then, for 15 years, Williams dabbled in journalism, writing art and literature reviews for journals. Williams wrote a half-dozen plays before finally getting one produced: Thunderstick in 2001. The play was panned by the Globe and Mail when it premiered in Toronto, earning a half star rating. In Western Canada, the play fared better especially among native audiences. The play continued to tour for 10 years playing in every major city across Canada. In 2013 Thunderstick went on a four-city tour in Western Canada, and featured Lorne Cardinal of Corner Gas fame and Craig Lauzon of Air Farce who traded off roles in the two hander on alternate nights.
