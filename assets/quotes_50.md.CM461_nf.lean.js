History Novecento Italiano was founded by Anselmo Bucci (1887‚Äì1955), Leonardo Dudreville (1885‚Äì1975), Achille Funi, Gian Emilio Malerba (1880‚Äì1926), Pietro Marussig, Ubaldo Oppi, and Mario Sironi.Roh et al. 1997, p. 296. Motivated by a post-war \\"call to order\\", they were brought together by Lino Pesaro, a gallery owner interested in modern art, and Margherita Sarfatti, a writer and art critic who worked on Italian dictator Benito Mussolini's newspaper, The People of Italy (Il Popolo d'Italia). Sarfatti was also Mussolini's mistress. The movement was officially launched in 1923 at an exhibition in Milan, with Mussolini as one of the speakers. The group was represented at the Venice Biennale of 1924 in a gallery of its own, with the exception of Oppi, who exhibited in a separate gallery.Roh et al. 1997, p. 297. Oppi's defection caused him to be ejected from the group,Roh et al. 1997, p. 298. which subsequently split and was reformed. The new Novecento Italiano staged its first group exhibition in Milan in 1926. Several of the artists were war veterans; Sarfatti had lost a son in the war. The group wished to take on the Italian establishment and create an art associated with the rhetoric of Fascism. The artists supported the Fascist regime and their work became associated with the state propaganda department, although Mussolini reprimanded Sarfatti for using his name and the name of Fascism to promote Novecento.Saviona Mane, \\"The Jewish mother of Fascism\\", Haaretz, 6 July 2006 The name of the movement (which means 1900s) was a deliberate reference to great periods of Italian art in the past, the Quattrocento and Cinquecento (1400s and 1500s). The group rejected European avant garde art and wished to revive the tradition of large format history painting in the classical manner. It lacked a precise artistic programme and included artists of different styles and temperament, for example, Carr√† and Marini. It aimed to promote a renewed yet traditional Italian art. Sironi said, ‚Äúif we look at the painters of the second half of the 19th century, we find that only the revolutionary were great and that the greatest were the most revolutionary‚Äù; the artists of Novecento Italiano ‚Äúwould not imitate the world created by God but would be inspired by it‚Äù. Despite official patronage, Novecento art did not always have an easy ride in Fascist Italy. Mussolini was personally uninterested in art and divided official support among various groups so as to keep artists on the side of the regime. Opening the exhibition of Novecento art in 1923 he declared that ‚Äúit is far from my idea to encourage anything like a state art. Art belongs to the domain of the individual. The state has only one duty: not to undermine art, to provide humane conditions for artists, to encourage them from the artistic and national point of view.\\"Braun, E., Mario Sironi and Italian Modernism: Art and Politics under Fascism, Cambridge University Press, 2000, p.1 The movement was in competition with other pro-Fascist movements, especially Futurism and the regionalist Strapaese movement. Novecento Italiano also met outright opposition. Achille Starace, the General Secretary of the Fascist Party, attacked it in the Fascist daily press and there was virulent criticism of its ‚Äúun-Italian\\" qualities by artists and critics. In the 1930s, a group of professors and students at the Accademia di Brera established an opposition group to Novecento Italiano. Among them was the director of the academy Aldo Carpi, and students Afro, Aldo Badoli, Aldo Bergolli, Renato Birolli, Bruno Cassinari, Cherchi, Alfredo Chighine, Grosso, Renato Guttuso, Dino Lanaro, Giuseppe Migneco, Mantica, Ennio Morlotti, Aligi Sassu, Ernesto Treccani, Italo Valenti, and Emilio Vedova (and later Giuseppe Ajmone and Ibrahim Kodra), with participation from Trento Longaretti, who wasn't involved in the foundational discussions because he returned to his hometown Treviglio by train after classes. This movement became known as Corrente, which also published a magazine by that name. By 1939, a famous editorial in the magazine stated the group's opposition to fascism, Novecento Italiano, and Futurism. The unity of the group depended much on Sarfatti and it weakened in her absence from Milan. When she was distanced from Mussolini, in part due to the anti-Semitic ordinances of 1938, the group fell apart and was formally disbanded in 1943.

Fleet action is defined by combat and not just manoeuvring of the naval forces strategically, operationally or tactically without engaging. Most famous large naval battles in history were fleet actions. A fleet action is unrelated to participation of any formation that is a named naval fleet, and usually includes only major parts of such formations. A general fleet action has been defined as one > aimed to destroy, incapacitate or capture the enemy's main body and thereby > accomplish the principal strategic objective of the war at sea.p.147, Vego The Battle of Jutland, although consisting of several smaller battles and engagements, came closest to what was considered a general fleet action in the late \\"long\\" 19th century.p.150, Vego As an example of fleet action orders, the following were issued by Admiral Spruance commanding United States Fifth Fleet at 1415 on 17 June 1944: > Our air will first knock out enemy carriers, then will attack enemy > battleships and cruisers to slow or disable them.

The Battle of Leyte Gulf is considered the last ever surface battle fleet action in history, and one in which the Allied forces nearly destroyed the entire Japanese fleet, which lost three battleships, all four aircraft carriers, six cruisers, and more than a dozen destroyers.

Around AD 172, the Anartes refused to assist the Romans in their war against the Marcomanni. To punish them, the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius ordered the deportation of (all?) the Anartes from their native homelands to the Roman province of Pannonia Inferior, a movement which took place not later than AD 180.

The overwhelming majority of the personnel were ethnic Chechens, while the command personnel were mixed ethnic Russian and Chechens. The Special Battalions were formed during the Second Chechen War as a force of Chechen volunteers under the direct control of the Russian government to perform operations in the mountain-forests of Chechnya. The two units operated independently from each other, with Zapad covering the western half of Chechnya and Vostok covering the eastern half, and their own commanders subordinate to the GRU but under the command network of the 42nd Guards Motor Rifle Division. The Special Battalions Vostok and Zapad operated for most of the Second Chechen War, and were briefly deployed by Russia in conflicts outside of Chechnya, until they were disbanded in 2008. Organization Vostok and Zapad were organized at the end of 1999,Dossier: Chechen Security Forces 2000 ‚Äì 2006 initially as two special companies formed in the structure of the Mountain Grouping of the Russian Ministry of Defence; they were assigned to the commandant's offices (kommendantura) established on the territory of the Chechen Republic in 2002. The Chechen personnel were of diverse origins. Zapad servicemen were loyal to the Russian government, while the core of Vostok were former separatist fighters of the 2nd Battalion of the National Guard of Ichkeria from Gudermes, who had fought against Russian troops in the First Chechen War of 1994-1996; they then switched to the federal side and swore allegiance to Russia. The units were directly subordinate to the GRU, but operationally they were included in the structure of the 42nd Motor Rifle Division. Following the 2006 Lebanon War, members of both units were sent to protect Russian field engineers on a peacekeeping mission in Lebanon. The two battalions (each about 600-900 strong) were the only ethnic Chechen units in the structure of the Russian Ministry of Defence and outside the control of the Chechen government, which was increasingly dominated by the Chechen militia leader Ramzan Kadyrov. Zapad was commanded by career officer Said-Magomed Kakiyev while Vostok was controlled by the controversial Yamadayev clan (thus earning them the name of Yamadaevtsy, or \\"Yamadayev men\\"), which was powerful enough to rival Kadyrov.

It is a metabolic enzyme involved in the pentose phosphate pathway. It is caused by mutation in the transaldolase gene (TALDO1). It was first described by Verhoeven et al. in 2001. Signs and Symptoms The leading symptoms of Transaldolase Deficiency are coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, hepatic fibrosis and dysmorphic features. The dysmorphic features can include antimongoloid slant, low-set ears, and cutis laxa. Those affected by this disease have abnormal polyol concentrations in urine and other bodily fluids, this can determined by an abnormal liver function tests. With transaldolase deficiency there is a buildup of sedoheptulose 7-phosphate (it is increased six to sevenfold in the blood compared to normal), which decreases the change of ribose 5-phosphate into glucose 6-phosphate. This reaction is important in releasing NADPH. Reduced glutathione is essential for regulation of Mitochondrial membrane permeability and depends on the NADPH generated from the pentose phosphate pathway to be regenerated from oxidized glutathione. Transaldolase plays an important role in male fertility; this is because it maintains the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and its role in the release NADPH. Therefore, transaldolase deficiency decreases the mobility of spermatozoa and lowers male fertility. Liver cirrhosis is associated with increased apoptosis of hepatocytes and transaldolase is a regulator in apoptosis signaling processing ‚Äì therefore transaldolase deficiency can result in liver cirrhosis. Causes This pentose phosphate pathway in humans with the reaction catalysed by transaldolase underlined. TALDO1 is either mutated by the deletion of residue Ser171 or a replacement of Arg192 by His or Cys, changing the formation of the protein. The deletion of Ser171 leads to inactivation and proteasome-mediated degradation of TALDO1. This shows the pentose phosphate pathway in humans with transaldolase catalysing the following reaction: D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate + D-sedoheptulose 7-phosphate <=> D-fructose 6-phosphate + D-erythrose 4-phosphate Diagnosis There are two different techniques for the diagnosis of Transaldolase deficiency. Metabolite Analyses Autozygome analysis and biochemical evaluations of urinary sugars and polyols can be used to diagnose Transaldolase Deficiency. Two specific methods for measuring the urinary sugars and polyols are liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography with flame ionization detection. Mutation Analysis Direct sequence analysis of genomic DNA from blood can be used to perform a mutation analysis for the TALDO1 gene responsible for the Transaldolase enzyme. Treatment At this time there is no treatment for transaldolase deficiency. There is currently research being done to find treatments for transaldolase deficiency. A study done in 2009 used orally administered N-acetylcysteine on transaldolase deficient mice and it prevented the symptoms associated with the disease. N-acetylcysteine is a precursor for reduced glutathione, which is decreased in transaldolase deficient patients. Epidemiology Transaldolase deficiency is recognized as a rare inherited pleiotropic metabolic disorder first recognized and described in 2001 that is autosomal recessive. There have been only a few cases that have been noted, as of 2012 there have been 9 patients recognized with this disease and one fetus.

Maybin, A nostalgic look at Belfast Trams, Silver Link Publishing Ltd, Peterborough, 1994, . History Belfast's first trams operated in 1872 and were horse-drawn. Initially, the system was owned and operated by the Belfast Street Tramways Company. It was purchased by the Belfast Corporation on 1 January 1905 and electrified, using overhead wires, in 1905. Belfast's electric trams were originally painted red and white. Some older, unmodernised trams retained this livery until the 1950s. In 1928, a new general manager was appointed: William Chamberlain, formerly of Leeds Corporation Tramways. Chamberlain introduced a new livery of dark blue and white (although the former red and white was re-adopted in the late 1940s). He was also responsible for the modernisation of 50 of the older tramcars and the construction of 50 new vehicles. Chamberlain was succeeded by Robert McCreary in 1931, who introduced a further fleet of 50 streamlined trams in 1935 ‚Äì the last trams to be built for Belfast. These trams gained also the nickname \\"McCreary\\". Colonel McCreary retired in 1951 and was succeeded by Joseph Mackle. Closure Belfast Corporation converted the Falls Road tram service to trolleybuses in 1938. The Corporation regarded this as successful and a decision to eliminate the tram system was made in 1939. Trolleybuses continued to be introduced during the 1940s. The last trams ran in 1954 and, following a policy change, were replaced by diesel buses. The trolleybuses were themselves replaced by diesel buses in 1968. The Belfast Corporation bus fleet was transferred to Citybus (now Metro) in 1973.

(2 min 16 s, 320x240, 340 kbit/s video) Various scientists and engineers contributed to the development of internal combustion engines. In 1791, John Barber developed a turbine. In 1794 Thomas Mead patented a gas engine. Also in 1794 Robert Street patented an internal-combustion engine, which was also the first to use the liquid fuel (petroleum) and built an engine around that time. In 1798, John Stevens designed the first American internal combustion engine. In 1807, French engineers Nic√©phore (who went on to invent photography) and Claude Ni√©pce ran a prototype internal combustion engine, using controlled dust explosions, the Pyr√©olophore. This engine powered a boat on the Sa√¥ne river, France. The same year, the Swiss engineer Fran√ßois Isaac de Rivaz built and patented a hydrogen and oxygen powered internal-combustion engine. The fuel was stored in a balloon and the spark was electrically ignited by a hand-operated trigger. Fitted to a crude four-wheeled wagon, Fran√ßois Isaac de Rivaz first drove it 100 meters in 1813, thus making history as the first car-like vehicle known to have been powered by an internal-combustion engine. In 1823, Samuel Brown patented the first internal combustion engine to be applied industrially in the U.S., one of his engines pumped water on the Croydon Canal from 1830 to 1836. He also demonstrated a boat using his engine on the Thames in 1827, and an engine-driven carriage in 1828. Father Eugenio Barsanti, an Italian engineer, together with Felice Matteucci of Florence invented the first real internal combustion engine in 1853. Their patent request was granted in London on June 12, 1854, and published in London's Morning Journal under the title \\"Specification of Eugene Barsanti and Felix Matteucci, Obtaining Motive Power by the Explosion of Gasses\\". In 1860, Belgian Jean Joseph Etienne Lenoir produced a gas-fired internal combustion engine. In 1864, Nicolaus Otto patented the first atmospheric gas engine. In 1872, American George Brayton invented the first commercial liquid-fueled internal combustion engine. In 1876, Nicolaus Otto, working with Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach, patented the compressed charge, four-stroke cycle engine. In 1879, Karl Benz patented a reliable two-stroke gas engine. In 1892, Rudolf Diesel developed the first compressed charge, a compression ignition engine. In 1926, Robert Goddard launched the first liquid-fueled rocket. In 1939, the Heinkel He 178 became the world's first jet aircraft. In 1954 German engineer Felix Wankel patented a \\"pistonless\\" engine using an eccentric rotary design.

He bases his argument on the extremely low efficiency of existing compressor designs. Due to Stern's eminence, his paper is so convincing there is little official interest in gas turbine engines anywhere, although this does not last long. * 1921: Maxime Guillaume patents the axial-flow gas turbine engine. It uses multiple stages in both the compressor and turbine, combined with a single very large combustion chamber. * 1923: Edgar Buckingham at the United States National Bureau of Standards publishes a report on jets, coming to the same conclusion as W.J. Stern, that the turbine engine is not efficient enough.

The inventors claimed their engine could burn on almost any petroleum based fuel of any octane and even some alcohol based fuels‚Äîe.g. kerosene, benzine, motor oil, tractor oil, etc.‚Äîwithout the pre- combustion knock and the complete burning of the fuel injected into the cylinder.

Engine starting Early internal combustion engines were started by hand cranking. Various types of starter motor were later developed. These included: * An auxiliary petrol engine for starting a larger petrol or diesel engine. The Hucks starter is an example * Cartridge starters, such as the Coffman engine starter, which used a device like a blank shotgun cartridge. These were popular for aircraft engines * Pneumatic starters * Hydraulic starters * Electric starters Electric starters are now almost universal for small and medium-sized engines, while pneumatic starters are used for large engines. Modern vs. historical piston engines The first piston engines did not have compression, but ran on an air-fuel mixture sucked or blown in during the first part of the intake stroke. The most significant distinction between modern internal combustion engines and the early designs is the use of compression of the fuel charge prior to combustion. The problem of ignition of fuel was handled in early engines with an open flame and a sliding gate. To obtain a faster engine speed Daimler adopted a Hot Tube ignition which allowed 600 rpm immediately in his 1883 horizontal cylinder engine and very soon after over 900 rpm. Most of the engines of that time could not exceed 200 rpm due to their ignition and induction systems. The first practical engine, Lenoir's, ran on illuminating gas (coal gas). It wasn't until 1883, that Daimler created an engine that ran on liquid petroleum, a fuel called Ligroin which has a chemical makeup of Hexane-N. The fuel is also known as petroleum naphtha. Otto's first engines were push engines which produced a push through the entire stroke (like a Diesel). Daimler's engines produced a rapid pulse, more suitable for mobile engine use.

Gelli is a former coal mining village which is a district of the community of Ystrad. Early and industrial history The village of Gelli takes its name from a farm that was once found in the area, which translates from the Welsh language roughly as 'small wood or copse'. Before the industrialisation of the area there were few settlements in the area, mainly small agricultural and farm buildings. Archeological finds in the area have provided proof of earlier populations, mainly Bronze Age, though Gelli does house one of only two definite Romano-British finds in the Rhondda Valleys. Roman finds in the uplands of Glamorgan are scarce, but the settlement at Hen Dre'r Gelli, excavated in 1903, is the only undefended settlement of its type in the Rhondda. A lengthy archaeological report was published in 1906, but little remains of the site, with much destroyed during the construction of the Nant y Gwyddon refuse tip.Davis, Paul R. 'Historic Rhondda' Hackman (1989) pp.14 The farmlands of 19th century Gelli were owned by absentee landlords, like Crawshay Bailey and the Earl of Dunraven, who would gain from selling the areas when coal exploration began. The first pit sunk in Gelli was in the 1870s, undertaken by the firm owned by Edmund Thomas and George Griffiths. The Gelli Colliery was then purchased by brothers, John and Richard Cory who deepened the pit further. The colliery suffered a mining accident when a gas explosion in 1893 took the lives of five miners. Subsequently the pit was sold to the Powell Duffryn Company, who owned the mine until the nationalisation of the mining industry in 1947. A second pit was opened by David Davies in 1877, the Eastern Colliery, though this closed in 1937. Modern Gelli River Rhondda showing flood defences at Gelli As with all villages in the Rhondda Valley, since the end of the coal mining industry, the area has suffered an economic depression with a history of unemployment higher than the national average. With little employment in the area apart from retail services many people commute to work outside the valley. Gelli, which is adjoined by the communities of Ton Pentre and Ystrad, experiences fairly heavy levels of road traffic, with the B4223 ‚Äì linking Llwynypia to Cwmparc ‚Äì passing through the village. Gelli has also suffered in the past from flooding, owing to its low- lying level in relation to the River Rhondda, and after two serious floods in 1960 and 1970, the council responded by making improvements to the flood defences known as the Rhondda Wall. Gelli (Nantgwyddon) was also home to a landfill site which has been at the centre of controversial reports connecting it with birth defects in children born in the nearby vicinity. The reports resulted in a full scale environmental report, and the decision by the local authorities to cease the dumping of domestic waste at the site.Domestic dumping stops at landfill site BBC Web site 13 December 2001 Education Gelli Primary School, located on Ystrad Road, is the English language primary school that serves the village.\\"Gelli Primary School\\", Estyn, 25 June 2004.

Headlands are characterised by high, breaking waves, rocky shores, intense erosion, and steep sea cliff. Headlands and bays are often found on the same coastline. A bay is flanked by land on three sides, whereas a headland is flanked by water on three sides. Headlands and bays form on discordant coastlines, where bands of rock of alternating resistance run perpendicular to the coast. Bays form when weak (less resistant) rocks (such as sands and clays) are eroded, leaving bands of stronger (more resistant) rocks (such as chalk, limestone, granite) forming a headland, or peninsula. Through the deposition of sediment within the bay and the erosion of the headlands, coastlines eventually straighten out then start the same process all over again.

Plot  Brood of the Witch-Queen was reprinted in the January 1951 issue of Famous Fantastic Mysteries The novel begins with the strange murder of Sir Michael Ferrara. A horrifying series of events follows, leading to a woman being used against her will to prey on her husband and then abducted and killed inside a secret chamber in an old Egyptian pyramid.

Constant voltage sources  An electrochemical cell is a device capable of either generating electrical energy from chemical reactions or facilitating chemical reactions through the introduction of electrical energy. A common example of an electrochemical cell is a standard 1.5-volt cell meant for consumer use. This type of device is known as a single Galvanic cell, so an obsolete name for steady current was galvanic current. A battery consists of two or more cells, connected in either parallel or series pattern.http://hyperphysics.phy- astr.gsu.edu/hbase/chemical/electrochem.html A homopolar generator is an electrical generator comprising an electrically conductive disc or cylinder rotating in a plane perpendicular to a uniform static magnetic field. A magnetohydrodynamic generator directly extracts electric power from moving hot gases through a magnetic field, without the use of rotating electromagnetic machinery. AC generators can be used as sources of steady current with a rectifier and a good ripple filter. Pulsed DC generators can be used as sources of steady current with a good ripple filter.  Constant current power supplies  In electronics, a constant current system is one that varies the voltage across a load to maintain a constant electric current. When a component is indicated to be driven by a constant current, the driver circuit is, in essence, a current regulator and must appear to the component as a current source of suitable reliability. An important usage of constant current power supplies is with LEDs. While a high series resistance is sufficient to light an LED, sometimes the design needs to guard against high current (or risk burning out the LEDs). Another use is in fluorescent lamps which have very dynamic electrical resistance and are optimally operated within a short range of currents.

Thomas Toft (died November 1698) was an English potter working in the Staffordshire Potteries during the 17th century. He and his family are known for large earthenware plates heavily decorated by slip-trailing, often in several colours. Work in this style, even by other makers, is known as Toft ware. Pottery It is thought that Toft, who may have been of Scandinavian origin, operated in the Burslem district during at least 1671-1689. The Staffordshire potters were at that time known for the excellence of their slipware; a kind of coarse earthenware decorated with a coloured clay and water mixture of cream-like consistency called slip. Sometimes a red slip was trailed on to a lighter background, sometimes vice versa. Black and green slips were also used. According to the common practice of the time, these earthenwares were glazed with a galena lead oxide glaze, giving them their characteristic yellow tinge. A dish with the Thomas Toft signature. Designs attributed to Thomas Toft include mermaids, unicorns, pelicans, but also King Charles II and his wife Queen Catherine of Braganza, and numerous coats of arms. A cross-hatched rim was fairly typical of the style. The Toft style, combined with the slip trailing technique, was firmly established in the Staffordshire area by the middle of the seventeenth century. Over thirty signed dishes have been recorded but a few of them may have been made by his son, also called Thomas Toft. Life and family Mermaid charger by Ralph Toft Charger in the Toft style, with slip-trailed decoration of Charles II in the Boscobel Oak, c. 1685 Very little is known about Toft's life. His father died in 1669. He married to Ellena Bucknall on 21 April 1663. Toft died a pauper in 1689 and was buried at Stoke-upon-Trent, now one of the six towns making up the city of Stoke-on-Trent, on 3 December 1689. His wife Ellena died two years later in 1691. They had five children: Matthias (b.1663), John (b.1664), Thomas (1670‚Äì1723), James (b.1673) and Cornelius (1677‚Äì1728). Toft became the grandfather to seven children although he did not live long enough to witness any of their births. Two, Maria (1701‚Äì1703) and Matthew (b.1698) were the children of James. Whilst Carol (b.1706), Cornelius (b.1703), Edward (1698‚Äì1701) and Standley (b.1700) were all the children of Matthias and his wife Dorothy Dickinson (d.1713). Much later, Charles Toft, Sr. (circa 1828-1890) was a leading designer for Mintons, and his son Albert Toft (1862‚Äì1949) was a sculptor, whose career was dominated by public commemorative commissions in bronze, especially of Queen Victoria.

Ralph's name appears on many typical Toft-style dishes decorated with a double-headed eagle, cavaliers and ladies, or with a mermaid, two being dated 1676 and 1766. Ralph married Christabell Hatton (d.1693), the couple had no known children. James Toft James Toft (b.1673) was Thomas' fourth son, it is believed that he is the maker of a number of Toft dishes that bear his name.

Retrieved: 2013-03-21. is a village on the eastern bank of the River Barrow in the south of County Carlow, Ireland. It is less than 2 km off the R729 regional road. History Ruins of the monastery at St. Mullins The village is named after Saint Moling (or Mo Ling, 614‚Äì697), who founded a monastery there in the early 7th century. The monastery was said to have been built with the help of \\"Gob√°n Saor\\", the legendary Irish builder. In the 8th-century manuscript, known as \\"The Book of Mulling\\", there is a plan of the monastery - the earliest known plan of an Irish monastery - which shows four crosses inside and eight crosses outside the circular monastic wall. It is said that St Moling dug a mile-long watercourse with his own hands to power his mill, a task that took seven years. He became Bishop of Ferns, died in 697 and is buried at St. Mullins. The St Moling watercourse is still there, but the original monastery was plundered by vikings in 951 and was again burnt in 1138. An abbey was later built on the site. A 9th-century high cross, showing the crucifixion and a Celtic spiral pattern, stands outside the remains of the abbey. There are also the remains of a Norman motte and some domestic medieval buildings, including one that has an unusual diamond-shaped window. St Moling's Mill and St Moling's Well are closeby. St. Mullins Graveyard and Monastic Site In Irish folklore, St. Mullins is said to be the place where Suibhne Geilt dies, after having been welcome in the monastery by Saint Moling himself. St. Moling's Well St. Moling's Well The first reference to a holy well at St. Mullins is to be found in the Annals of Friar Clyn (1348). In those times, the plague swept across Ireland and pilgrims visited the holy well in St. Mullins out of fear of the plague. They would circle the well in a clockwise direction, known as circumambulation, while reciting prayers. For hundreds of years the holy well at St. Mullins was a place of pilgrimage. Canon John O'Hanlon, author of Lives of the Irish Saints, whose account dates from the late 1800s tells of the crowd assembling there on 17 June and on 25 July each year. They drank from the well and carried water home for those unable to visit. The pilgrims made the rounds (a prescribed walk) three times and waded barefoot through the stream. They recited prayers at each of the ruined churches where they prayed nine Our Fathers and nine Hail Marys. Patron Day was traditionally kept on 17 June as a day of rest in the parish and nobody would work. According to one account on one occasion a local family went to work in the fields as usual. Suddenly St. Moling appeared to them. One of those present attempted to run away and he was turned into a stone at the place he had reached which is called 'Stuckan-na-Drana'. The workers who remained eating their lunch were also turned into stones. This happened at a place called 'Maol Oula' the Bald or Barren Place. Fairs were held at St. Mullins on 17 June, St. Moling's Day, 25 July, St. James' Day, 8 September Feast of the Blessed Virgin Mary and on 1 November, Feast of All Saints. River Barrow River Barrow at St. Mullins As well as being visited by anglers, St. Mullins is one of the stop-off points for pleasure barges and cruisers who transit the River Barrow. The building of the canal on the Barrow began here in 1750 and the Old Grain Store was built to store goods coming up the river from the sailing ships in New Ross. The horses and carts came down the tracks from the Blackstairs Mountains to gather their supplies and sell their goods for export. Horses were kept in the old stables to pull the barges up-river and the blacksmith was on hand to repair the barges and shoe the draught horses. By 1920 the Bolinder engine had arrived and with motorized barges the long serving horses were no longer needed. St. Mullins is also the beginning and ending point for the Barrow Way long distance walk.

History Aerial view The depot was opened in 1939 on the site of Buckhill Colliery (opened 1873, closed 1932; the colliery's spoil heap remains a prominent feature of the site to this day). In 1944 the site was expanded from 800 to 1050 acres. The depot continued to be used by the Ministry of Defence until 1963, at which point it was leased to the Federal Republic of Germany. From 1977 it was used by the United States Navy for storage of armaments for its North Atlantic Squadron (the weapons were flown out of the site by helicopters shuttling back and forth over a number of days to a USN Cargo Ship lying offshore and away from the town's harbour of Workington); and from 1981 Broughton Moor was formally adopted as a NATO storage site. The site was decommissioned at the end of the Cold War, finally closing on 31 December 1992. Railway The site had a narrow gauge railway. Locomotives from this railway are preserved on the Almond Valley and Whipsnade railways. In 1970 the locomotives in use at Broughton Moor consisted of: * Navy Department standard gauge diesel locomotives: 1 x Hunslet 1 x Ruston & Hornsby Class 165DS. * Navy Department narrow gauge locomotives: 2 x Hunslet 25HP 4 x Hunslet 50HP 2 x Ruston & Hornsby Class 20DL, (Nos. R1/2) 6 x Ruston & Hornsby Class 48DL, (Nos. R4/6/7/8/10/12). * Ministry of Public Buildings & Works narrow gauge locomotives: 2 x Motor Rail 2 x Hunslet The site was connected to the main line via a branch line to Siddick Junction, north of Workington railway station and utilised a headshunt at Northside to change direction northbound on to the Cumbrian Coast Line. The branch closed on 4 June 1992, being the last part of the Cleator and Workington Junction Railway in operation. The railway equipment at RNAD Broughton Moor was sold by tender in April and July 1992 and consisted of approximately 3 miles of standard gauge track and 25 miles of narrow gauge (2 ft 6in) track. The sale also included 4 standard gauge locomotives built by Ruston & Hornsby and Hunslet, 27 narrow gauge locomotives by the same builders and 127 wagons, including 6 box vans, 4 brake vans (2 x 4tons & 2 x 6 tons) and 99 flat wagons.Source: MOD Schedule of lots, T7038 (April 1992) & T8003 (July 1992). Accidents An explosion occurred at RNAD Broughton Moor on 18 January 1944 which resulted in the death of 11 people and left 70 people injured. The coroners hearing was reported in the Cumberland Evening Star in February 1944. The explosion appears to have occurred in one of the traverse laboratories, photos showing the aftermath include a gauge box van No. 267. Present day The large majority of the buildings and bunkers remain along with underground storage and an extensive network of storage sheds and other military buildings. Ownership of the site was transferred from the Ministry of Defence to Allerdale Borough Council in 2008 who have yet to decide what to do with the site. The site was purchased by the Borough Council for ¬£1. In October 2008 Cumbria County Council called for interest in the redevelopment of the site rebranded as Derwent Forest. As yet there has been little interest due to the huge cost involved with cleaning up the site. There are unexploded ordnance and large amounts of asbestos as well as unmarked mine shafts when it was a colliery prior to World War II. Furthermore, having previously ruled out allowing the site to be used for coal mining, Allerdale council later agreed to allow mining by any prospective future owners as a way to raise funding for any potential tourism development.http://coalintheuk.org/opencast-mining-on- broughton-moor-dump-is-only-solution/ It was announced on 13 January 2011 that the two shortlisted developers for the site would not mine the site, allaying fears about the environmental impact of the development of the site.

He won the gold medal and became the first Italian Olympic Champion in wrestling in 20 years after his teacher Maenza. Abrahamian and the Swedish coach Leo Myll√§ri disputed the judges' ruling. Myll√§ri accused the judges of corruption because they initially awarded Abrahamian a point, but after the round they assigned the point and the match to Minguzzi because Abrahamian had his hand in the blue zone. Normally, having a hand in the blue zone is not penalized. Minguzzi had almost his whole body in the blue zone earlier in this match. Therefore, the Swedes demanded a video review of the match, but the referees refused to review the recording of the incidents nor consider the written Swedish protest. During the medal ceremony, Abrahamian, who won a bronze medal in the repechage, stepped off the podium and placed the medal in the center of the wrestling mat and left. Abrahamian later stated the corrupt judges had been bribed, and pointed out that the judge through marriage is related to Rapha√´l Martinetti, the President of FILA, the governing body of wrestling. The next year Minguzzi won a silver medal at the June 26, 2009 at the 2009 Mediterranean Games. He was unable to qualify to participate at the 2012 Summer Olympics.

Field flattener lenses in binoculars improve edge sharpness and lower the distortion. Field flattener lenses counteract the Petzval field curvature of an optical system. In other words, the function of a field flattener lens is to counter the field-angle dependence of the focal length of a system. The object in designing a field flattening lens is to create a lens that shifts the focal points of the Petzval surface to lie in the same plane. Consider inserting a pane of glass in a focusing beam. Due to refraction, the focal point of the beam is shifted by \\\\delta_{x} dependent on the thickness of the glass. Thus we have a thickness as a function of focal shift: :t(\\\\delta_{x})=\\\\left(\\\\frac{n}{n-1}\\\\right)\\\\delta_{x}. \\\\delta_{x}(y) is given by the radius of curvature of the Petzval surface, R_{p}. It can be shown, then, that the radius of curvature for the lens that would flatten out the field is given by :R_{f}=\\\\left(\\\\frac{n-1}{n}\\\\right)R_{p}. Examples of use In the 21st century, the New Horizons spacecraft, which was unmanned space probe sent past Pluto and the Kuiper belt, had a telescope instrument called the Long Range Reconnaissance Imager.

Header-only libraries do not need to be separately compiled, packaged and installed in order to be used. All that is required is to point the compiler at the location of the headers, and then \`#include\` the header files into the application source. Another advantage is that the compiler's optimizer can do a much better job when all the library's source code is available. The disadvantages include: * brittleness ‚Äì most changes to the library will require recompilation of all compilation units using that library * longer compilation times ‚Äì the compilation unit must see the implementation of all components in the included files, rather than just their interfaces * code- bloat (this may be disputed) ‚Äì the necessary use of inline statements in non- class functions can lead to code bloat by over-inlining. Nonetheless, the header-only form is popular because it avoids the (often much more serious) problem of packaging. For C++ templates, including the definitions in header is the only way to compile, since the compiler needs to know the full definition of the templates in order to instantiate.

He recorded over 500 tracks for DECCA and over 80 albums for RCA, and wrote the soundtrack to the 1971 film The Railway Children, plus 37 other feature films. In the 1980s, he also composed and conducted music for many television series, including the children's TV animation series Spider- Man, Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends, Dungeons & Dragons, The Incredible Hulk, G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero and The Transformers. Early years Douglas was born in Hackney, London, England, on 19 June 1920, the eldest of two sons of John and May Douglas. The family moved to Bermondsey where his mother was a housewife and his father held a secretarial position until he became Alderman of West Bermondsey Council. One of his earliest recollections was playing gramophone records on a machine that produced sound via a large green horn. By associating the music he heard with the colour and design of the labels on the 10‚Äù heavy and sometimes single sided records, he learned how to select the tune he wanted to hear. At 2¬Ω, his parents listened, not believing their own ears, when he played on the piano, one finger fashion, one of the popular tunes of the day that he had heard on one of his father‚Äôs records. He remembered playing \\"The Washington Post\\" that he learned from a record, which he felt sure was a green labelled Regal Zonophone. Douglas went to school at 3 years where he was soon asked to demonstrate his pianistic ability to the assembled teachers. At 3¬Ω years he played a duet with the head teacher at a school concert - the piece, \\"Rendezvous\\". He started piano lessons when he was 4 years old and gradually became interested in how music sounds were made. His music teacher discovered that he could name the notes with his back to the piano. This seemed not in the least extraordinary to him until she brought in all the occupants of the house to witness his ‚Äútrick‚Äù. He then began to realise that he had performed something unusual. He discovered the mysteries of arranging and orchestration at about 10 years old and gleaned knowledge of instruments and transpositions by studying printed band parts and listening to records. He won a government scholarship to St. Olaves & St. Saviours, a grammar school in Tooley Street, Bermondsey and at 13 formed a band, mainly of school friends, which won several dance band contests. He left school when he was 18 years old, continued with his band and began working as a clerk in an accounts office. Early professional career He made his first professional appearance in 1939 as pianist with the Neville Hughes Sextet and soon afterwards was called up for war service in the Royal Air Force, serving on various aerodromes in Scotland and England. He formed his own R.A.F. dance band and when, later, an arm injury prevented him from playing the piano for about two years, he concentrated on arranging and composing. He won a Melody Maker Jazz Jamboree award for the best dance band composition. After the war he sent a copy of one arrangement to all the bandleaders of the day. George Elrick replied and engaged him as staff arranger. He began arranging for many famous bands including Bert Ambrose, Ted Heath and Edmundo Ros then became pianist/arranger with the Cyril Stapleton Band and pianist with broadcasting outfits of all kinds and at society balls. Association with RCA In 1948, to gain more experience, he joined a music publisher as staff arranger and there began to write for orchestras rather than dance bands. He started scoring and conducting vocal backings for Decca in 1952 and his first hit was Tex Ritter's \\"High Noon\\", released on Capitol. During the next three years he recorded over 500 titles for Decca, backing many famous names including Al Martino, and was Musical Director on many hits. It was at this time that he started broadcasting with his own orchestra but it was not until 1958 that he was asked to score Living Strings Play Music of the Sea for RCA. It was recorded at the Kingsway Hall, London, with an orchestra of 61 musicians, an experience he was never to forget. This began his long association with RCA, New York, where it was his good fortune to work with A & R producer, Ethel Gabriel. During the next twenty-five years he scored and conducted 80 albums for RCA Living Strings alone and received a gold disc for the RCA album entitled Feelings. Broadcasting In 1955 he began broadcasting with the BBC, with his own programme entitled In the Still of the Night, and there have been countless broadcasts since. From 1960 onwards his work increased tremendously. He began composing and scoring for films, had his own programme, again on BBC radio, entitled Swing Song, which ran for two years, and was arranging for TV shows for such international stars as Shirley Jones, Howard Keel, Vera Lynn and Shirley Bassey. He was also arranging for numerous other recording artists. Douglas had to his credit over 100 albums and 36 feature films, the most well known of the latter being The Railway Children, for which he received a British Academy Film & TV Arts BAFTA Nomination, and Dulcima, for which he conducted the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. He also wrote the theme to the long-running cinema featurette series The Scales of Justice. He composed and arranged the music for the American TV children‚Äôs series Spider- Man and His Amazing Friends, Dungeons & Dragons and The Incredible Hulk and Pandamonium. He was also composer of the incidental music and arranger of all the music for The Transformers and G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero. During the 1970s Douglas was a frequent contributor to BBC Radio 2 programmes such as Open House, Top Tunes, After Seven, The Terry Wogan Show, The Tony Brandon Show, The Late Night Extra, Music to Midnight and Charlie Chester's Sunday Soapbox, either with his own orchestra or conducting one of the Radio orchestras. Tracks from his albums with The Johnny Douglas Orchestra and The Johnny Douglas Strings are frequently played on the various easy listening programmes. Record label In 1983 Douglas started his own record label, Dulcima Records, producing top quality digitally recorded easy listening albums with different artists and with his own orchestra. At the end of 1999 he completed his first classical composition - a symphonic poem. It is a light classical work with three movements, entitled \\"The Conquest\\". The work was recorded for the label and was highly acclaimed by musicians, colleagues and radio presenters. This encouraged him to write a sequel, another symphonic poem entitled \\"The Aftermath\\", as well as a descriptive composition for solo flute entitled \\"The Blue Damsel-fly\\". These compositions are available on an album of new classical works entitled Johnny Douglas in Concert, with the Dulcima Symphony Orchestra. Death and legacy Douglas had suffered from prostate cancer for several years and died on 20 April 2003, at his home in Bognor Regis. He was survived by his wife, Marion, two daughters (his son died in 1988) and three grandchildren. Since his death, Dulcima Records has continued to keep his music alive by licensing his past recordings from the records companies that he worked for throughout his career. The ninth Johnny Douglas release on the label, and one of the most successful, is The Railway Children.

It was founded by Ing. Medardo Rodriguez who desired to create a Computer Programming Research Team with headquarters in Las Villas U but formed by people with spontaneous and free ideas about what a computer team and software should be. The Merchise name per-se was an idea of the other co-founder Ing. Miguel Cepero and it refers to Mayan wizard deity . History Merchise Logo Despite the fact it was feed from students from different departments of the U like Electrical, Computer Sciences, Mechanic, Industrial and Chemistry Departments producing code and graphics during their free time and night shifts the group manage to quickly be noticed not only at its original Campus but nationwide. Fame that probably played a strong role in the rise and fall of it. As \\"free thinking\\" was one of the premises of the team, most of its members had the strong will to create a niche market for Cuban video games. But in a society where games were consider at the time harmful and thus playing was forbidden at all times at all schools a team willing to create games was soon perceived as the black sheep and set to extinction. After trying and failing with \\"Axthor\\" a 2D arcade quite similar in style to Delphine Software's Another World a good opportunity opened for the group at this activity when \\"La Fortaleza: en las entra√±as de la Bestia\\" (The Fortress:inside the Beast's guts) or just Fortaleza I, a text RPG created by Cepero himself gain positive reviews in Cuba and Mexico. Soon after several games start to develop at Merchise studios, Fortaleza II (La venganza de la bestiaThe Beast's revenge) was one of it, but must important was a project named \\"Escape del Castillo de la Fisica\\" (Escape from Physic's Castle) a visual point-and-click game in the fashion of LucasArts Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis or the Monkey Island (series). By end of 1994 Escape had a multi department team working on it with the full approval of the University authorities that so far considered the dissolution of the group. Since Escape was meant to solve Physics problems a team of two teachers from that Department join the project and it was tested several times with children from different grades and schools and it finally proved that gaming was a reliable tool to teach all along. Special mention deserves Merchise's own engine creation tool known as \\"Magister Ludi\\" what could be at that time compared, again, to LucasArt's SCUMM. All games and several other types of interactive environments were created using Magister Ludi all over the University's Departments. Proven themselves as top programmers and designers of their time, in 1995 Merchise Group finally got their dream chance when Canadian software developers Oceanus Communications came along with a very ambitious project for software developing involving Massively multiplayer online games, Internet Media Integration and more. Ottawa era  From late 1997 to 2003, year when it finally was dismantled, most of members of former Merchise group had joined Oceanus Communications in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada in their joint quest to conquer International markets.

It lies in a basin developed along a fault extending from the Mediterranean Sea to the Gulf of Suez through the Bitter Lakes region. In 1800, a flood filled the Wadi Tumilat, which caused Timsah's banks to overflow and moved water south into the Bitter Lakes about nine miles (14 km) away.Hoffmeier, p.43 In 1862, the lake was filled with waters from the Red Sea, and became part of the Suez Canal.Stanley, p.32 Geography Lake Timsah lies within a depression that spans the isthmus between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. The lowest points of the depression form shallow natural lakes, of which Timsah is one. The surface area of Lake Timsah covers 5.4 square miles. Most of the lake is marshy and depth rarely exceeds 3 feet (1 metre). It has been asserted that, in ancient times, Lake Timsah was the northern terminus of the Red Sea.The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition, s.v. \\"Suez Canal\\".

March 4, 1863, the city of Ismailia, named in honor of the viceroy Ismail Pasha, arose on Lake Timsah's northern bank.Nourse, p.54 Several beaches overlook the lake, including the Moslem Youth, Fayrouz, Melaha, Bahary, Taawen, and a few Suez Canal Authority beaches. Canals The Suez Canal at Ismailia by the northern bank of Lake Timsah, c. 1860. Completion of the segment brought waters from Lake Manzaleh to Lake Timsah. Lake Timsah possibly first became a juncture for canal construction approximately 4,000 years ago during the Middle Kingdom of Egypt,Shea, William H. \\"A Date for the Recently Discovered Eastern Canal of Egypt\\" Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, No. 226 (Apr., 1977), pp. 31-38 and was expanded by Darius I.Paice, Patricia \\"Persians\\" in Kathryn A. Bard and Steven Blake Shubert, eds. Encyclopedia of the Archeology of Ancient Egypt(New York: Routledge, 1999), Suez Canal construction in the vicinity of Lake Timsah began in 1861 on the segment north of the lake. Initial preparations included the construction of sheds to house 10,000 workers, steam sawmills, and importation of large quantities of wheelbarrows and wooden planks. 3,000 laborers dug a channel from the Nile to Lake Timsah in 1861 and 1862, which brought a fresh water supply to the area. It was also proposed to construct a halfway port at this point along the canal. The Ismailia section of the Suez Canal, which connected Lake Manzala to Lake Timsah, was completed in November 1862. Construction of the segment was completed with forced labor, which expanded the workforce to 18,000 men. The trench measured wide by four to six feet deep and connected Lake Timsah to the Mediterranean Sea. Work began south of Lake Timsah in 1862-1863 as expansion continued on the northern segment. Forced labor was used during canal construction from March 1862 until Ismail Pasha outlawed the practice in 1864. As a result of the canal, waters from Lake Manzaleh flowed into Lake Timsah. Expansion continued on the northern segment until 1867 and on the southern segment until 1876. Environment Lake Timsah is a brackish lake that experiences significant variations in salinity. Human engineering projects have impacted salinity, with resulting changes in the lake's biota. Decreases in salinity were noted as early as 1871 following Suez Canal construction, and subsequent enlargement of the channel from the Nile and other construction projects increased the inflow of fresh water to the lake. The El-Gamil outlet serves as Lake Timsah's principal source of salt water. Timsah's main source of fresh water was annual Nile flooding until the Aswan High Dam interrupted these flows in 1966, although groundwater also accounts for much of the lake's freshwater supply. Lake Timsah experiences both stratification variations in salinity and seasonal surface variations in salinity, and in recent decades freshwater taxa have been overtaking brackish taxa. In 2002, a study was conducted to check the concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in fish and shellfish species that locals consume from the lake. Samples included tilapia, crabs, bivalves, clams and gastropods. The results showed that crabs contained \\"significantly higher concentrations of both total and carcinogenic PAHs than other species, while clams contained significantly lower levels of PAHs.\\" In 2003, a number of groups attempted to relieve the lake of pollution. It was a significant event for the local community, since the lake is of economic importance to the city and its fishermen.

She was born in Lefko≈üa (Nicosia), Cyprus and spent her early youth in the United Kingdom, acquiring British citizenship and she became a hairdresser in London. Once settled in Turkey, she also obtained Turkish citizenship, marrying for convenience the janitor of the block of apartments in ƒ∞stanbul where she lived concluding for that purpose. She started in show business as a stage stripper, and she appeared in her first film in 1964. She was the mother of actress Z√ºmr√ºt Cansel. Career She started her acting career with secondary roles in Turkish cinema's mainstream movies, and who attained fame after she started to appear in seks filmleri, a particular genre of which had developed in Turkey in the mid-1970s to last until the eve of the 1980s. Her name became synonymous with the then rising wave of films of the genre, with a much reduced story line and a soft- to mid-hardcore pornographical content arranged to match the tastes of local audiences often disguised as comedy films. According to the Sinemat√ºrk database of Turkish films, Feri Cansel's career spanned 18 years during which she acted in 136 films. 120 of these films can be categorized as belonging in the erotic line. Cansel herself, on the other hand, claimed in 1978 that she had by then appeared in 350 erotic movies. Both figures could make Cansel win the career-long title for the highest number of erotic Turkish movies made by any actor/actress. The difference between the two figures is explained by the extensive practice at the time by the film producers, who viewed films that were shot not as parts of a single work but merely as source material for production of multiple films, to cut and paste. Erotic scenes, especially, were often cut and pasted to assemble new films from various parts of existing ones. This peculiar practice was called \\"par√ßa\\" (literally the \\"fragment\\"), and the term was extended into the movie theaters themselves to include the practice by the operators of inserting hardcore material, which was European most of the time, into Turkish \\"erotic\\" films. Cansel's liberal use of foul language in her films earned her the nickname of Emmanuelle of Kasƒ±mpa≈üa, a popular quarter of Istanbul notorious for its peculiar speech rich in slang. She was killed by her fianc√© in Istanbul in 1983. Cansel was survived by her daughter Zumrut Cansel who also embarked on a brief acting career after the murder of her mother.

They occupy a large stretch of the eastern coastal region of Madagascar, from Mananjary in the south to Antalaha in the north. The Betsimisaraka have a long history of extensive interaction with European seafarers and traders that produced a significant subset with mixed European- Malagasy origins, termed the zana-malata. European influence is evident in the local valse (waltz) and basesa musical genres, which are typically performed on the accordion. Tromba (spirit possession) ceremonies feature strongly in Betsimisaraka culture. Through the late 17th century, the various clans of the eastern coastal region were governed by chieftains who typically ruled over one or two villages. A zana-malata named Ratsimilaho emerged to unite these clans under his rule in 1710. His reign lasted 50 years and established a sense of common identity and stability throughout the kingdom, but his successors gradually weakened this union, leaving it vulnerable to the growing influence and presence of European and particularly French settlers, slave traders, missionaries and merchants. The fractured Betsimisaraka kingdom was easily colonised in 1817 by Radama I, king of Imerina who ruled from its capital at Antananarivo in the Central Highlands. The subjugation of the Betsimisaraka in the 19th century left the population relatively impoverished; under colonisation by the French (1896-1960), a focused effort was made to increase access to education and paid employment working on French plantations. Production of former plantation crops like vanilla, ylang-ylang, coconut oil, and coffee remain the principal economic activity of the region beyond subsistence farming and fishing, although mining is also a source of income. Culturally, the Betsimisaraka can be divided into northern and southern sub-groups. Many elements of culture are common across both groups, including respect for ancestors, spirit possession, the ritual sacrifice of zebu, and a patriarchal social structure. The groups are distinguished by linguistic sub-dialects and various fady (taboos), as well as certain funeral practices and other customs. The Betsimisaraka practice famadihana (reburial) and sambatra (circumcision) and believe in sorcery and a wide range of supernatural forces. Many taboos and folktales revolve around lemurs and crocodiles, both of which are common throughout Betsimisaraka territory. Ethnic identity Distribution of Malagasy ethnic groups The Betsimisaraka constitute approximately 15 percent of the population of Madagascar and numbered over 1,500,000 in 2011. A sub-set of the population, the zana-malata, has partly European origins resulting from generations of intermarriage between the local Malagasy population and European pirates, sailors and traders who docked or settled along the eastern coast. Like the Sakalava to the west, the Betsimisaraka are composed of numerous ethnic sub-groups that formed a confederation in the early 18th century. Most Betsimisaraka are of mixed Bantu African and Asian Austronesian descent. The Betsimisaraka occupy a long, narrow band of territory that stretches along the east coast of Madagascar from Mananjary in the south to Antalaha in the north, including the island's main port at Toamasina and the major towns of F√©n√©rive Est and Maroansetra. They are often subdivided into northern Betsimisaraka (Antavaratra) and southern Betsimisaraka (Antatsimo), separated by the Betanimena Betsimisaraka sub-clan (called the Tsikoa before around 1710). History Until the beginning of the 18th century, the peoples who would constitute the core of the Betsimisaraka were organized into numerous clans under the authority of chiefs (filohany) who each typically ruled over no more than one or two villages. Those around Antongil Bay in the north held a comparatively more official position, with regalia of leadership attested since at least 1500. The presence of natural bays along the northern coastline that became the port towns of Antongil, Titingue, Foulpointe, Fenerive and Tamatave favored the economic and political development of the Antavaratra Betsimisaraka; the southern portion of this coastline, by contrast, lacked any areas suitable for ports. Villagers in the areas surrounding the ports exported rice, cattle, slaves and other goods to the nearby Mascarene Islands. The eastern ports' strategic position for regional trade attracted the heaviest settlement of Europeans to this portion of the island, particularly including British and American pirates whose numbers dramatically increased from the 1680s to the 1720s along the coast from modern day Antsiranana in the north to Nosy Boraha and Foulpointe to the east. Intermarriage between these European pirates and the daughters of local chiefs produced a large mixed population termed zana-malata. Ratsimilaho ruled the united Betsimisaraka from his capital at modern day Foulpointe. Around 1700 the Tsikoa began uniting around a series of powerful leaders. Ramanano, the chief of Vatomandry, was elected in 1710 as the leader of the Tsikoa (\\"those who are steadfast\\") and initiated invasions of the northern ports. According to oral histories, Ramanano established an armed militia at Vohimasina which he sent on incursions to burn neighboring villages, desecrate local tombs, and enslave the women and children, contributing to his reputation as a cruel and unpopular leader. A northern Betsimisaraka zana-malata named Ratsimilaho, who was born to the daughter of a local filohany and a British pirate named Thomas Tew around 1694 and had briefly traveled with his father to England and India, led a resistance to these invasions and successfully united his compatriots around this cause despite his young age. He captured Fenerive in 1712, causing the Tsikoa to flee across soggy red fields of clay that stuck to their feet, earning them the new name of Betanimena (\\"Many of Red Earth\\"). Ratsimilaho was elected king of all the Betsimisaraka and given a new name, Ramaromanompo (\\"Lord Served by Many\\") at his capital at Foulpointe. He gave his northern compatriots the name Betsimisaraka to reaffirm their unity in the face of their enemies. He then negotiated peace with the Betanimena by offering their king control over the port of Tamatave, but this settlement fell apart after six months, leading Ratsimilaho to recapture Tamatave and force the Betanimena king to flee south. He established alliances with the southern Betsimisaraka and the neighboring Bezanozano, extending his authority over these areas by allowing local chiefs to maintain their power while offering tribute of rice, cattle and slaves; by 1730 he was one of the most powerful kings of Madagascar. By the time of his death in 1754, his moderate and stabilizing rule had provided nearly forty years of unity among the diverse clans within the Betsimisaraka political union. He also allied the Betsimisaraka with the other most powerful kingdom of the time, the Sakalava of the west coast, through marriage with Matave, the only daughter of Iboina king Andrianbaba. Ratsimilaho's son Zanahary succeeded him in 1755. A despotic leader, Zanahary launched a series of attacks against villages under his authority and was assassinated by his own subjects in 1767. Zanahary was succeeded by his son Iavy, who was detested for continuing his father's practice of attacking villages under his control, and for enriching himself by cooperating with French slave traders. During the reign of Iavy, an eastern European adventurer named Maurice Benyowsky established a settlement in Betsimisaraka country and proclaimed himself king of Madagascar, persuading several local chieftains to no longer pay tribute to Iboina. This action provoked Sakalava ire, and in 1776 Sakalava soldiers invaded the area to punish the Betsimisaraka inhabitants and kill Benyowsky, but were ultimately unsuccessful in the latter goal. Zakavolo, Iavy's son, succeeded his father upon his death in 1791. European accounts disparage Zakavolo for insisting that they provide him with gifts, and for insulting them when the Europeans refused to meet his demands. His subjects deposed him in 1803 with the assistance of then Governor General Magallon, who administered the French island territories; Zakavolo was eventually assassinated by his ex-subjects. Throughout the decades following Ratsimilaho's death, the French established control over Ile Sainte Marie and had established trading ports throughout Betsimisaraka territory. By 1810 a French envoy named Sylvain Roux effectively had economic control over the port city, although it was nominally governed by Zakavolo's uncle Tsihala. A dispute among Tsihala's male relatives over control of the city led to further fracturing of Betsimisaraka political unity, weakening the ability of the Betsimisaraka to unite against increasing foreign encroachment. He lost power the following year to another zana-malata, Jean Rene, who maintained close cooperation with the French. A pirate cemetery at Nosy Boraha. The zana-malata subset of the Betsimisaraka traced their heritage back to intermarriage between European pirates and Betsimisaraka women. The Kingdom of Imerina in the island's center had been rapidly unifying and expanding since the late 18th century. In 1817, Merina king Radama I led an army of 25,000 soldiers from Antananarivo to successfully capture Toamasina. Although Jean Rene was not complicit and had been given no forewarning of the military campaign, when Radama arrived the Europeans and zana-malata were not expelled; rather, Radama developed a cooperation with them to develop diplomatic and economic relations with the French as he had already done over the past decade with British missionaries in the Merina homeland of the central highlands. The area was effectively colonized, with Merina garrisons established at ports and across the Betsimisaraka interior. The Betsimisaraka resented Merina domination and, not receiving assistance from the French as they had hoped, mounted an unsuccessful rebellion in 1825. As Merina presence and authority in the former Betsimisaraka kingdom grew, many local farmers migrated to areas outside Merina control or sought employment with European settlers on plantations where they might be afforded some protection. Any remnants of the ruling line in Betsimisaraka were eliminated under Merina queen Ranavalona I, who ordered many nobles to undergo the deadly tangena trial by ordeal. Throughout her reign, cultural practices associated with Europeans were forbidden, including Christianity and Western musical instruments; eventually all Europeans were expelled from the island for the duration of her reign. Her son, Radama II, lifted these restrictions and gradually European presence re-emerged in Betsimisaraka territory as French entrepreneurs established plantations for growing export crops like vanilla, coffee, tea and coconuts. The growing number of Merina colonists from the turn of the 19th century and Europeans from the 1860s onward created competition for use of the ports traditionally under Betsimisaraka control, to such an extent that the local population was prohibited from trading to maximize profits for the Merina and Europeans. This severe economic constraint, coupled with the heavy Merina imposition of fanampoana (unpaid labor in lieu of taxes), severely undermined the prosperity of the local population, who resisted by refusing to grow surplus crops that would only further enrich the outside traders. Others fled the settled life of their ancestral villages to take refuge in the forest in order to live outside Merina authority. Some of these formed into groups of bandits who plundered Merina trading parties along the east coast and mounted occasional raids further into Merina territory; these groups also periodically attacked Merina settlers, European missionaries, government outposts and churches. When the French colonized Madagascar in 1896, initial Betsimisaraka satisfaction with the fall of the Merina government rapidly evolved into displeasure with French control. This led to an uprising the same year among Betsimisaraka, particularly including the bandits and other outlaws who had long been living according to their own law in the eastern rainforests; the movement extended to the broader Betsimisaraka population, who mounted a strong resistance to French rule in 1895. These efforts were eventually subdued. After regaining control, the French colonial authority took steps to address the repercussions of historical subjugation of the Betsimisaraka by the Merina kingdom, providing increased access to basic education as well as opportunities for paid labor at plantations, but often on former Betsimisaraka land that the French authorities had forced local inhabitants to relinquish to colonists. In 1947, a nationwide uprising against French colonial rule was initiated in Moramanga, a town in Bezanozano territory neighboring the Betsimisaraka. During the conflict, Betsimisaraka nationalists fought French and Senegalese soldiers in an unsuccessful attempt to regain control of the port at Tamatave, the island's most important trading port. Betsimisaraka fighters and civilians suffered very heavy losses and some of the worst human rights abuses, including execution by being thrown alive from airplanes. The country gained independence in 1960. It was led throughout the Second Republic (1975-1992) by Admiral Didier Ratsiraka, a Betsimisaraka. He was democratically elected president and again led the country from 1995 to 2001 during the Third Republic before being forced from power following contested 2001 presidential election by followers of Merina businessman and opposition leader Marc Ravalomanana. He remains an influential and controversial political figure in Madagascar. Ratsiraka's nephew, Roland Ratsiraka, is likewise a significant political figure, having run for president and serving as mayor of Toamasina, the country's main commercial port. Society Social life revolves around the agricultural year, with preparation of fields beginning in October, the harvest of rice in May, and the winter months from June to September set aside for ancestor worship and other major rituals and customs. There are clear gender divisions among the Betsimisaraka. When traveling by foot in a mixed gender group, it is forbidden for women to walk before men. Women are traditionally the ones to act as porters, carrying light items on the head and heavy items on the back; if a woman is present, it is considered ridiculous for a man to carry something. When eating, men use a single spoon to fill their plates from the communal bowl and to eat the food on their plates, whereas women are required to use two separate spoons to fill their plates and to eat. Men are generally responsible for tilling the rice fields, obtaining food, gathering firewood and building the family home and furniture, and they engage in discussion and debate about public affairs. Women's tasks include growing crops, weeding the rice fields and harvesting and processing the rice, fetching water, lighting the hearth fire and preparing daily meals, and weaving. Religious affiliation Religious rites and customs are traditionally presided over by a tangalamena officiant. Betsimisaraka communities widely believe in various supernatural creatures, including ghosts (angatra), mermaids (zazavavy an-drano) and the imp-like kalamoro. Efforts to Christianize the local population began in the early 19th century but were largely unsuccessful at first. During the colonial period the influence of Christianity among the local population grew, but where it is practiced is often blended syncretically with traditional ancestor worship. Syncretism of Christian and indigenous beliefs led to the motif that the sun (or the moon) was the original location for the Garden of Eden. Culture Although there are differences between the northern and southern Betsimisaraka, many major aspects of their culture are similar. Major customs among the Betsimisaraka include sambatra (circumcision), folanaka (the birth of a tenth child), ritual sacrifice of zebu for the ancestors, and celebrating the inauguration of a newly constructed house. Marriage, death, birth, the New Year and Independence Day are also communally celebrated. The practice of tromba (ritual spirit possession) is widespread among the Betsimisaraka. Both men and women act as mediums and spectators in these events. The indigenous raffia palm was the base fiber for the clothing traditionally worn by the Betsimisaraka. Leaves of the raffia were combed to separate the fibers, which were knotted end to end to form strands that could then be woven together to form cloth. Among the various peoples who united under the Betsimisaraka confederation, women wore a short wrapper (simbo), typically with a bandeau top (akanjo), while men wore smocks. Traditional raffia clothing is still worn by some Betsimisaraka today. The Betsimisaraka hold lemurs in high regard and tell several legends in which lemurs come to the aid of prominent Betsimisaraka figures. According to one story, a lemur saved the life of a Betsimisaraka ancestor from a grave peril. In another tale, a group of Betsimisaraka sought refuge in a forest from a marauding enemy group. Their enemies followed them into the forest, tracking the Betsimisaraka by what they believed to be the sound of their voices. Upon reaching the source of the sound they discovered a group of ghostly-looking lemurs and, believing the Betsimisaraka had been transformed into animals by magic, fled the area in terror. The spirits of Betsimisaraka ancestors are believed to reside inside the bodies of lemurs. Consequently, in general it is forbidden for the Betsimisaraka to kill or eat lemurs, and it is obligatory to free a trapped lemur and to bury a dead lemur with the same rites as a person. Crocodiles are also viewed with reverence and fear. At river banks where they are known to gather, it is not uncommon for Betsimisaraka villagers to throw them zebu hindquarters (the most favored cut), whole geese and other offerings on a daily basis. Amulets for protection against crocodiles are commonly worn or thrown into the water in areas where the animals congregate. It is commonly believed that witches and sorcerers are closely linked with crocodiles, being capable of ordering them to kill others and of walking among them without being attacked. The Betsimisaraka believe witches and sorcerers appease crocodiles by feeding them rice at night, and some are accused of walking crocodiles through Betsimisaraka villages at midnight or even being married to the crocodiles, which they then enslave to do their bidding. Fady Among some Betsimisaraka it is considered fady for a brother to shake hands with his sister, or for young men to wear shoes during their father's lifetime. Among many Betsimisaraka, the eel is considered sacred. It is forbidden to touch, fish or eat eel. Although many coastal Malagasy communities have a fady against the consumption of pork, this is not universal or common among the Betsimisaraka, who often keep pigs in their villages. Complex taboos and rites are associated with a woman's first childbirth. When about to give birth she is secluded in a special birthing house called a komby. The leaves she eats from and the waste produced by the newborn are kept in a special receptacle for seven days, at which point they are burned. The ash produced is rubbed on the forehead and cheeks of the mother and baby and must be worn for seven days. On the fifteenth day both are bathed in water in which lime or lemon leaves have been soaked. This ritual is called ranom-boahangy (bath of the leaves). The community gathers to drink rum and celebrate with wrestling matches, but the mother must stay in the komby. She is not allowed to consume anything other than saonjo greens and a chicken specially prepared for her. After this celebration she is required to leave the komby and can return to routine life. Among the Betsimisaraka, like several other Malagasy ethnic groups, there is a fady against speaking the name of a chief after his death or any word that formed part of the name. The deceased leader was given a new name after death that all were required to use, and specific synonyms were selected to replace the words composing his name for use in regular conversation; anyone who spoke the forbidden words would be harshly punished or in some instances executed. Funeral rites Some Betsimisaraka, principally those living around Maroantsetra, practice the famadihana reburial ceremony, although in a simpler form than that practiced in the Highlands. Coffins are placed in tombs only in southern Betsimisaraka; in the north, they are placed under outdoor shelters. While in mourning, women will unbraid their hair and stop wearing their akanjo, while men no longer wear a hat; the mourning period typically lasts two to four months depending on how closely related the individual was to the deceased. Dance and music The ceremonial dance music style most closely associated with the tromba among the Betsimisaraka is called basesa and is performed on accordion. The traditional basesa performed for tromba ceremonies uses kaiamba shakers to accentuate the rhythm; lyrics are always sung in local Betsimisaraka dialect. The accompanying dance is performed with arms to the sides of the body and heavy foot movements. Contemporary basesa, which has been popularized across the island, is performed using a modern drum kit and electric guitar and bass with keyboard or accordion accompaniment, and the associated dance style has been influenced by dances performed to sega and kwassa kwassa music from Reunion Island. Basesa is also performed by the Antandroy, but among Betsimisaraka the style is performed significantly more slowly. Another major musical style specific to the region is valse, Malagasy interpretations of traditional European seafarers' waltzes performed on accordion; this genre is never performed during tromba ceremonies. Language The Betsimisaraka speak several dialects of the Malagasy language, which is a branch of the Malayo- Polynesian language group derived from the Barito languages, spoken in southern Borneo. Economy A Betsimisarakian hen house and a rice barn in 1911, Fenerive. Photo by Walter Kaudern. The Betsimisaraka economy remains largely agricultural, with many cultivating vanilla and rice. Manioc, sweet potatoes, beans, taro, peanuts and a variety of greens are also commonly cultivated; other staple crops include sugar cane, coffee, bananas, pineapples, avocado, breadfruit, mangoes, oranges and lychees. Cattle are not widely raised; more commonly, the Betsimisaraka may catch and sell river crabs, shrimp and fish, small hedgehogs, various local insects or wild boar, birds and lemurs in the forest. They also produce and sell homemade sugarcane beer (betsa) and rum (toaka). The production of spices for culinary use and for distillation into perfumes remains a major economic activity, with a perfume distillery located in Fenoarivo Atsinanana. Gold, garnet and other precious stones are also mined and exported from the Betsimisaraka region.

This can occur when an approximate orbital- based wave function is represented in an unrestricted form ‚Äì that is, when the spatial parts of Œ± and Œ≤ spin-orbitals are permitted to differ. Approximate wave functions with a high degree of spin contamination are undesirable. In particular, they are not eigenfunctions of the total spin-squared operator, ≈ú2, but can formally be expanded in terms of pure spin states of higher multiplicities (the contaminants).  Open-shell wave functions  Within Hartree‚ÄìFock theory, the wave function is approximated as a Slater determinant of spin-orbitals. For an open-shell system, the mean-field approach of Hartree‚ÄìFock theory gives rise to different equations for the Œ± and Œ≤ orbitals. Consequently, there are two approaches that can be taken ‚Äì either to force double occupation of the lowest orbitals by constraining the Œ± and Œ≤ spatial distributions to be the same (restricted open-shell Hartree‚ÄìFock, ROHF) or permit complete variational freedom (unrestricted Hartree‚ÄìFock UHF). In general, an N-electron Hartree‚ÄìFock wave function composed of NŒ± Œ±-spin orbitals and NŒ≤ Œ≤-spin orbitals can be written as :\\\\Psi^{\\\\mathrm{HF}}(\\\\mathbf{r}_{1}\\\\sigma(1)\\\\cdots\\\\mathbf{r}_{N}\\\\sigma(N)) = \\\\mathcal{A}\\\\left(\\\\psi_{1}^{\\\\alpha}(\\\\mathbf{r}_{1}\\\\alpha_{1})\\\\cdots\\\\psi_{N_{\\\\alpha}}^{\\\\alpha}(\\\\mathbf{r}_{N_{\\\\alpha}}\\\\alpha_{N_{\\\\alpha}}) \\\\psi_{N_{\\\\alpha}+1}^{\\\\beta}(\\\\mathbf{r}_{N_{\\\\alpha}+1}\\\\beta_{N_{\\\\alpha}+1})\\\\cdots\\\\psi_{N}^{\\\\beta}(\\\\mathbf{r}_{N}\\\\beta_{N})\\\\right). where \\\\mathcal{A} is the antisymmetrization operator. This wave function is an eigenfunction of the total spin projection operator, ≈úz, with eigenvalue (NŒ± ‚àí NŒ≤)/2 (assuming NŒ± ‚â• NŒ≤). For a ROHF wave function, the first 2NŒ≤ spin- orbitals are forced to have the same spatial distribution: :\\\\psi^{\\\\alpha}_{j}(\\\\mathbf{r}_{j}) = \\\\psi^{\\\\beta}_{N_{\\\\alpha}+j}(\\\\mathbf{r}_{N_{\\\\alpha}+j}),\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ 1\\\\leq j\\\\leq N_{\\\\beta}. There is no such constraint in an UHF approach.  Contamination  The total spin-squared operator commutes with the nonrelativistic molecular Hamiltonian so it is desirable that any approximate wave function is an eigenfunction of ≈ú2. The eigenvalues of ≈ú2 are S(S + 1) where S can take the values 0 (singlet), 1/2 (doublet), 1 (triplet), 3/2 (quartet), and so forth. The ROHF wave function is an eigenfunction of ≈ú2: the expectation value ≈ú2 for a ROHF wave function is : \\\\langle S^{2}\\\\rangle_{\\\\mathrm{ROHF}} = \\\\langle S^{2}\\\\rangle_{\\\\mathrm{exact}} =\\\\left(\\\\frac{N_{\\\\alpha}-N_{\\\\beta}}{2}\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\frac{N_{\\\\alpha}-N_{\\\\beta}}{2}+1\\\\right). However, the UHF wave function is not: the expectation value of ≈ú2 for an UHF wave function is : \\\\langle S^{2}\\\\rangle_{\\\\mathrm{UHF}} = \\\\langle S^{2}\\\\rangle_{\\\\mathrm{exact}} + N_{\\\\beta} - \\\\sum_{i,j}^{\\\\mathrm{occupied}}\\\\langle\\\\psi_{i}^{\\\\alpha}\\\\psi_{j}^{\\\\beta}\\\\rangle^{2}. The sum of the last two terms is a measure of the extent of spin contamination in the unrestricted Hartree‚ÄìFock approach and is always non-negative ‚Äì the wave function is usually contaminated to some extent by higher order spin eigenstates unless a ROHF approach is taken. Naturally, there is no contamination if all electrons are the same spin. Also, there is often no contamination if the number of Œ± and Œ≤ electrons is the same. A small basis set could also constrain the wavefunction sufficiently to prevent spin contamination. Such contamination is a manifestation of the different treatment of Œ± and Œ≤ electrons that would otherwise occupy the same molecular orbital. It is also present in M√∏ller‚ÄìPlesset perturbation theory calculations that employ an unrestricted wave function as a reference state (and even some that employ a restricted wave function) and, to a much lesser extent, in the unrestricted Kohn‚ÄìSham approach to density functional theory using approximate exchange-correlation functionals.  Elimination  Although the ROHF approach does not suffer from spin contamination, it is less commonly available in quantum chemistry computer programs. Given this, several approaches to remove or minimize spin contamination from UHF wave functions have been proposed. The annihilated UHF (AUHF) approach involves the annihilation of first spin contaminant of the density matrix at each step in the self-consistent solution of the Hartree‚ÄìFock equations using a state-specific L√∂wdin annihilator. The resulting wave function, while not completely free of contamination, dramatically improves upon the UHF approach especially in the absence of high order contamination. Projected UHF (PUHF) annihilates all spin contaminants from the self-consistent UHF wave function. The projected energy is evaluated as the expectation of the projected wave function. The spin-constrained UHF (SUHF) introduces a constraint into the Hartree‚ÄìFock equations of the form Œª(≈ú2 ‚àí S(S + 1)), which as Œª tends to infinity reproduces the ROHF solution. All of these approaches are readily applicable to unrestricted M√∏ller‚ÄìPlesset perturbation theory.  Density functional theory  Although many density functional theory (DFT) codes simply calculate spin-contamination using the Kohn‚ÄìSham orbitals as if they were Hartree‚ÄìFock orbitals, this is not necessarily correct.

Early life Yury Patrikeyev started Greco-Roman wrestling in his hometown of Kirovo-Chepetsk under the direction of Paul Vertunova. In 1996, he enrolled in the Kuban State University of Physical Education and moved to Krasnodar, where he began wrestling under the direction of the honored coach of Russia, Igor Ivanov. Patrikeyev became a World Champion as a cadet in 1995 and a World Champion as a junior in 1999. Career Patrikeyev became a member of the Russian national Greco-Roman wrestling team in 2000. Two years later, he won a gold medal at the 2002 European Wrestling Championships and a bronze medal at the 2002 World Wrestling Championships. Patrikeyev won a gold medal at the 2004 European Wrestling Championships. Despite becoming European Champion, Patrikeyev lost in the finals of the Russian Championships against Khasan Baroyev later that year and was not included in the Russian national wrestling team at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Patrikeyev considered the decision of the coaching staff unfair because Baroyev had long been exempted from participation in international competitions and had the opportunity to conduct targeted training for the Championship of Russia. In connection with this, Patrikeyev had a conflict with the head coach of the Russian national team in Greco-Roman wrestling, Gennady Sapunov, and in 2005, he made the decision to change his Russian citizenship to Armenian. At the same time, Yury continued to live and train in Krasnodar, but later served under the flag of Armenia. He officially left the Russian national team in 2005. Now a wrestler of Armenia, Patrikeyev won a bronze medal at the 2007 World Wrestling Championships. The following year he won his third gold medal at the 2008 European Wrestling Championships. Patrikeyev competed at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. He won an Olympic bronze medal. Patrikeyev became the first Olympian to win an Olympic medal for Armenia that wasn't born in Armenia. Patrikeyev was a member of the Armenian Greco-Roman wrestling team at the 2009 Wrestling World Cup. The Armenian team came in third place. Patrikeyev personally won a silver medal.

His cover of Lloyd Price's \\"Lawdy Miss Clawdy\\" in 1958 went to number one in the New Zealand charts with sales of more than 100,000, launching a long-term career. He spent much of his time in Australia from 1959 touring in support of The Everly Brothers and making appearances on Australian television shows such as Bandstand, Six O'Clock Rock and The Go!! Show. In 1964 he toured Australia and New Zealand as a support act for The Beatles. Early years John Lockett Devlin was born on 11 May 1938, the son of a railway ganger stationed in the mid-North Island, either in Wanganui or the nearby small town of Raetihi. The family soon shifted to nearby Ohakune and then Marton before eventually settling in Wanganui, where John spent his formative years. He received a guitar for his eleventh birthday. Alongside his parents and three brothers they formed a group called the Devlin Family when he was in his early teens. The group performed country songs at Wanganui talent quests, playing songs from the Lever Hit Parade such as \\"Rock Around the Clock\\". The Devlin Family had been performing regularly until 1955, when the parents retired from the entertainment game. The four brothers, plus the odd friend or cousin, continued to perform as the River City Ramblers, playing country and western, skiffle, and later Bill Haley style rock'n'roll. Throughout 1956, enthusiasm began to ebb, and one by one the brothers dropped out, and more frequently weekends would see Johnny performing as a soloist. By the end of the year, the River City Ramblers were no more. It was then that he heard \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" and his life was changed forever. Devlin entered every amateur talent quest he could find and chasing up every Elvis Presley recording he could lay his hands on, for the next eighteen months he would perform nothing but Presley material. On weekends, Devlin would often go to Palmerston North and whenever he had the chance he would sing his Elvis songs in talent contests run at the youth club there by pioneering New Zealand rock'n'roller Johnny Cooper. The first to recognise a certain something in Devlin, Johnny Cooper took him under his wing, coached him in the art of stagecraft and persuaded him to practice his moves in front of a mirror. Cooper told Devlin that with work he could become New Zealand's Elvis Presley. In February 1957, aged 18, Devlin won his first talent quest as a rock 'n' roll performer. Other talent quests followed. In Palmerston North he met Dennis Tristram, a rock'n'roll dancer, who tried to persuade Devlin to move to Auckland. Devlin was happy to stay where he was, but did run into Tristram again later who persuaded Devlin to visit the Jive Centre and sing with the resident band. Owner Dave Dunningham gave him an audition and agreed to let him do a set that night. Devlin's debut at the Jive Centre featured an all-Presley repertoire and although there was a general buzz in the audience before he commenced, no-one was prepared for what was to follow. By the time he completed his set, girls were screaming and everyone else was in awe and disbelief. Dave Dunningham was impressed and offered him a regular spot. Back in Wanganui he thought it over and a month later, March 1958, he returned to Auckland. Dave Dunningham became his manager and within a month he had made Johnny Devlin the talk of the town. With Auckland conquered, Dunningham realised that the quickest way to break Devlin nationally was with a record release, but all the record companies in the country gave the thumbs down. They were very nervous about this type of music. Prestige Phil Warren, a part-time drummer, began working at Begg's Music Store in 1955, and later formed Prestige Records, primarily to distribute overseas releases from independent labels. Dunningham pressured Warren into recording Devlin, so they came to an agreement and selected a poor-selling Presley release, \\"Lawdy Miss Clawdy\\" for the debut single. It was recorded at the Jive Centre one Sunday afternoon in May 1958, using the Dixielanders as the backing group, and given the primitive circumstances of the session and surroundings, the quality was awful, but \\"Lawdy Miss Clawdy\\" launched Johnny Devlin as New Zealand's first superstar when it was released in June 1958 on the Prestige label. Recorded at the same session was the flipside, \\"When My Blue Moon Turns To Gold Again\\". A romping sax break replaces the guitar on Elvis's version. Although the single got very little airplay, and the broadcast panel thought it was not of sufficient quality, it was snapped up by Auckland's teens in an unprecedented frenzy. Once sales had topped the 2000 mark, the radio stations could no longer ignore it, and within a few weeks the disc was at the top of the Lever Hit Parade. By now the Dixielanders were out of the picture and Johnny was working with the Bob Paris Combo as his back-up band. Devlin was now in great demand and by August, his record sales had passed the 10,000 mark. Time to record more records. With this he entered Bruce Barton's Wellesley Street studio for his second recording session. Between August and October Devlin recorded a dozen tracks, to be released as Phil Warren saw fit. The Bob Paris Combo were used as backing on all of these tracks. Warren was receiving little-known records from American artists for distribution by his record company, but selected a few to give to Devlin to record. His second single was a cover of both sides of a Jimmy Lloyd record, \\"I Got A Rocket in My Pocket\\"/\\"You're Gone Baby\\". It received little airplay and sold only moderately well, but within a fortnight Devlin's third single appeared. \\"Slipping Around\\"/\\"Straight Skirt\\" sold a lot better and without the Presley influence, it demonstrated that New Zealand could produce credible rock'n'roll. By November 1958, his three singles had sold 50,000 copies. Between November 1958 and May 1959, Prestige released eight further singles, plus three EPs and an album, amassing total sales in excess of 200,000. Graham Dent was an employee of the Kerridge Organisation which operated a string of theatres and cinemas throughout the country. Dent had been responsible for making the Rock Around the Clock movie successful in the cinemas. He was promoted to manage a new cinema in the Auckland suburb of Point Chevalier. On Sunday afternoons he ran concerts for the local youth club and talent quests. Recognising Devlin's potential, he organised a concert there. With its success he approached his boss, Robert Kerridge, about the possibility of using their theatre chain to promote a national tour. After some initial doubt, his boss agreed to a two-week tour with extensions if successful. Dave Dunningham left the management to Phil Warren, so Phil and Graham put together a schedule. Bob Paris and his band weren't keen on going on the road, so a new backing band had to be put together. Dent asked multi-instrumentalist Claude Papesch if he could put a band together. Claude was a sixteen-year-old blind musician, who was a regular at the Point Chevalier youth club. Papesch recruited guitarist Peter Bazely, bassist Keith Graham and drummer Tony Hopkins. Together they became the Devils, one of New Zealand's first truly rock'n'roll bands. The tour kicked off at Wellington on 21 November 1958. Over the next two weeks he performed for close to 20,000 ecstatic fans in Wellington, Palmerston North, Masterton, Napier, Gisborne and Tauranga. The press raved and chaos broke out at every performance. The shows exceeded everyone's expectations, with New Zealand having never seen anything remotely like it. Back in Auckland, another two-week tour was being organised, but before setting out, Devlin was rushed back into the studio, where in one night he recorded sixteen more tracks. In late November his fourth single, recorded earlier in the year, was released. It was \\"6.5 Hand Jive\\"/\\"Play Rough\\". In December, five more records were released, three singles and two EPs. The singles were \\"Wild One\\"/\\"The Watch\\", \\"Crazy Baby Crazy\\"/\\"My True Love\\", and \\"Bony Moronie\\"/\\"Leroy\\". The first EP was a freebie called \\"Hit Tunes\\" put out by Coca-Cola, who had been part- sponsoring his tour. It contained the tracks \\"Cast Iron Arm\\", \\"Nervous\\", \\"Say Yeah\\", \\"Matador Baby\\", \\"Believe Me\\" and \\"Rave On\\". The other EP was called \\"How Would Ya Be?\\" and contained \\"Straight Skirt\\", \\"How Would Ya Be\\", \\"Slipping Around\\" and \\"I'm Grateful\\". Devlin set off on the second leg of his tour and the media followed him wherever he went. He was constantly making headlines. After his shows he was mobbed by screaming girls and on one occasion lost sleeves from his shirt. This was big news with headlines claiming \\"Girls fight over singer's shirt\\" and from then on a piece of his shirt was every girl's aim. By the end of 1958, Devlin had conquered the North Island, but was still relatively unknown in the South Island. A tour down there was going to be a challenge as there was a local lad in Christchurch who was also attracting attention. He was Max Merritt of Max Merritt & the Meteors. His fans were fiercely loyal and the bookings for the Christchurch show were light. Dent was going to cancel the show, but came up with an idea. He invited MP and Cabinet Minister Mabel Howard to a champagne party followed by the Devlin show, and after the pair would be driven off to meet up with Max Merritt. A pink convertible was used and of course the press were there, along with the usual mob of screaming fans. A stroke of genius and from there on the South Island was bedlam. By February 1959, Johnny Devlin's record sales had reached astronomical proportions. A new single was released, \\"20 Flight Rock\\"/\\"Move It\\" and another EP called \\"Johnny Sings Ballads\\". Its tracks were \\"Love Me\\", \\"I'm Counting on You\\", \\"Susie Darling\\" and \\"When My Mother Prayed For Me\\". Devlin's original recording of \\"Lawdy Miss Clawdy\\" had sold steadily since its mid-1958 release. With sales in excess of 30,000 and orders for another 10,000 after his South Island tour, it was decided to re-record the song under better conditions. The new version was released in February 1959 and well and truly out sold the original version, two to one, with combined sales exceeding 100,000. \\"Susie Darling\\" was placed on the flipside of the new version. In the next two months, two more singles and another EP were released. The first was \\"Nervous Wreck\\"/\\"Queen of the Hop\\" and the second a tribute to his backing band \\"Rock with the Devils\\" backed with \\"Devil's Rock\\", an instrumental by the Devils. The EP was just called \\"Johnny Devlin\\" and contained \\"High Heeled Shoes\\", \\"Hard To Get\\", \\"Big Green Car\\" and \\"Your Cheatin' Heart\\". In March 1959, Devlin left on what was to be his final tour of the country. He took in the smaller centres that hadn't experienced the Devlin hysteria and madness. It was same old story wherever he went, but inside the show, things were starting to fall apart. There was internal bickering, and being mobbed and screamed at was no longer a novelty. The whole touring thing was becoming a bore. The only remaining highlight came when in Wellington, he met the touring evangelist Billy Graham and the Prime Minister Walter Nash. A picture of the three of them appeared in the following day's newspaper. A week later, having had enough of the goings-on, Robert Kerridge pulled the plug on the tour. With his career in limbo, Devlin returned home to Wanganui to celebrate his 21st birthday. Meanwhile, Phil Warren received a phone call from Sydney-based American promoter, Lee Gordon, who was in the process of organising an Australasian tour for The Everly Brothers. He wanted to know if Phil could handle the New Zealand leg. Phil agreed on the condition that Devlin be placed on the bill for the Australian concerts. They agreed and with no fuss, fanfare or farewell concert, Johnny Devlin and the Devils slipped out of New Zealand in the last week of May 1959. Although he was moderately successful in Australia, his reign as a social phenomenon was over. It had lasted a mere twelve months. Another EP, also called \\"Johnny Devlin\\" was released, containing \\"Flat 13\\", \\"Queen of the Hop\\", \\"I Was Robbed\\" and \\"Patty\\". The last two Prestige singles also came out. They were \\"White Lightning\\"/\\"Doreen\\" and \\"I Was The One\\"/\\"Pointed Toe Shoes\\". Prestige also released an album called Johnny in 1959. 1959 onwards Devlin continued to record while in Australia. Between 1959 and 1981, while using at least 14 different record labels, he released a further 40 singles, ten EPs and three albums. With his new Australian manager John Collins he founded his own \\"Teen\\" label, for which he had three moderate hits: Turn the Lights Out Johnny (December 1959, written by Devlin), Gigolo (September 1960, Mitchell Torok) and Got a Zac in the Back of Me Pocket (November 1960, Nat Kipner). A \\"zac\\" was a six penny piece, worth about a dollar in today's money. Music World released an album called 24 Original Golden Greats in 1980 that contained all of his New Zealand singles. In 1963 and 1964 he recorded Stomp The Tumbarumba (written by Devlin), Blue Suede Shoes and Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On, the Bee Gees singing backup vocals on all three songs. Devlin wrote several songs for other artists, notably Good Looking Boy, a hit for Patsy Ann Noble in 1961. He wrote the official song for the 1974 Commonwealth Games in Christchurch, \\"The Games are On\\". Festival released two CDs with an overview of Devlin's recordings. The first in 1998 covered his Australian years, the second, released in 2001, a compilation of his New Zealand Prestige years. In June 2015 aged 77 Devlin suffered a heart attack while on board a P&O; cruise ship. He was transferred to St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney in a critical condition and received a triple bypass which saved his life. Johnny Devlin still continues to perform on the club level in Australia. Of the original Devils, only Claude Papesch remained in the music business. Widely traveled around Australasia, he eventually settled in NSW, working more in the jazz field than the rock'n'roll which launched him. Battling cancer during the last years of his life, he served time on the Blue Mountains City Council and was elected Deputy Mayor of Blue Mountains in 1984 but due to ill health was unable to complete his term. Claude died in February 1987, aged 45. Keith Graham went on to play with the Embers. Recognition * In 2007 Devlin won the Legacy Award (for lifetime achievement) at the New Zealand Music Awards, and was an inaugural inductee into the New Zealand Music Hall of Fame * In the 2008 New Year Honours, Devlin was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to entertainment. * In 2009 Devlin was presented with New Zealand's \\"Biggest One Hit Wonder of the Century Award\\", just edging out Ray Columbus with his \\"She's a Mod\\" * In October 2015 he was presented the Benny Award from the Variety Artists Club of New Zealand, the highest honour available for a New Zealand variety entertainer.

His current work focuses on adiabatic quantum computing and quantum annealing, areas where he has made widely cited contributions to studying the capabilities of the D-Wave Systems processors. His past interests include scattering theory and fractals. Lidar's research in quantum information processing has focused primarily on methods for overcoming decoherence. He wrote some of the founding papers on decoherence-free subspaces, most notably his widely cited paper \\"Decoherence-free subspaces for quantum computation\\", and their generalization, noiseless subsystems. These contributions were noted in his APS Fellow citation. He has also made major contributions to dynamical decoupling, in particular the invention of the concatenated dynamical decoupling (CDD) method. He has made a proposal to protect adiabatic quantum computation against decoherence, using dynamical decoupling, one of the only proposals to date dealing with error correction for the adiabatic model. Lidar has also worked on quantum algorithms, having written some of the pioneering papers in the subject on simulation of classical statistical mechanics and quantum chemistry. In his PhD work he made a widely cited observation on the limited scaling range of empirically observed fractals, which led to an exchange with Benoit Mandelbrot.

The bridge is located between Middlesbrough and Stockton-on-Tees just north of the A19's interchange with the A66 trunk road and carries the north-south traffic through Teesside avoiding the main towns but is also used extensively by local traffic. On the southern bank the bridge crosses the marshalling yard railway lines and the main Thornaby- Middlesbrough section of Tees Valley Line, the B6541 (Old A66/A67, Stockton Road) and the A66 road. On the northern bank the bridge crosses the Teesdale Way long-distance cycle/footpath, Lustrum Beck, a service road, footpath (disused railway line) and the main roundabout on the Portrack Interchange.  Design  The viaduct is a beam or girder bridge. It has reinforced concrete piers and pier bends supporting steel-plate girder beams and a composite deck with some 200 moving parts. The viaduct is 2.9 km long and 1.95 km between abutments and was at the time the largest such bridge in the British Isles. It has 68 spans on the main north south route--the largest span being that over the river at 117 m. The bridge was designed with sufficient clearance to allow ships to pass, although the port of Stockton-on-Tees up-river was virtually redundant by then. Since the Tees Newport Bridge had its lifting deck permanently fixed in the down position in 1990, large shipping can no longer reach the Tees viaduct, further reducing the need for such a high structure.  Construction  The bridge was built between 1973 and 1975 encompassing the 'Three-Day Week' and that may account for some of its subsequent problems.  Operation and maintenance  Continuing repair work on the viaduct The viaduct was opened in November 1975. The bridge has had problems with corrosion since it was opened and repairs have been necessary at times. Expansion joints cracked allowing de-icing salts to wash from the bridge carriageway into the piers, cross beams and columns giving rise to extensive chloride attack. It was then decided the best solution was the complete demolition and reconstruction of most of the piers and repair of others. The bridge was originally constructed with two-lane carriageways and a concrete apron up to the parapet but this was expanded to three lanes. River pier, drainpipe, GRP enclosure and access points From 1988 to 1989 the underside of the bridge was enclosed with a steel and GRP panelling structure to protect the primary structure from the effects of weather and to allow safe and easy inspection and maintenance. The A19 including the Tees Viaduct is operated by Autolink Concessionaires (A19) Limited, a consortium comprising Sir Robert McAlpine, Taylor Woodrow and Amey under a thirty year DBFO (Design Build Finance Operate) agreement with the Highways Agency running from 1997-2027. The bridge carried an average of 112,000 vehicles a day in 2016 and concerns that the capacity of the road is being exceeded at peak times has led to a study detailing the proposals for a new crossing. Because of this CCTV cameras were installed on the bridge to record incident related congestion and to enable a quicker response. Starting in 1997 the approach roads to the bridge were widened from two lanes to three. A detailed principal inspection report in 2006 concluded that the Tees Viaduct overall is in fair condition.

They are currently used as a means to comply with air emission standards such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Acid Rain Program,United States Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 72, Subpart A other federal emission programs, or state permitted emission standards. Facilities employ the use of CEMS to continuously collect, record and report the required emissions data. The standard CEM system consists of a sample probe, filter, sample line (umbilical), gas conditioning system, calibration gas system, and a series of gas analyzers which reflect the parameters being monitored. Typical monitored emissions include: sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen chloride, airborne particulate matter, mercury, volatile organic compounds, and oxygen. CEM systems can also measure air flow, flue gas opacity and moisture. In the U.S., the EPA requires a data acquisition and handling system to collect and report the data. emissions must be measured in pounds per hour using both an pollutant concentration monitor and a volumetric flow monitor. For NOx, both a NOx pollutant concentration monitor and a diluent gas monitor are required to determine the emissions rate in weight per volume or weight per heat value (for example lbs/million Btu, lbs/cuft, kg/kWh or kg/m3). Opacity must also be monitored. measuring is not a current requirement, however if monitored, a or oxygen monitor plus a flow monitor should be used. In monitoring these emissions, the system must be in continuous operation and must be able to sample, analyze, and record data at least every 15 minutes and then averaged hourly.  Operation  A small sample of flue gas is extracted, by means of a pump, into the CEM system via a sample probe. Facilities that combust fossil fuels often use a dilution- extractive probe to dilute the sample with clean, dry air to a ratio typically between 50:1 to 200:1, but usually 100:1. Dilution is used because pure flue gas can be hot, wet and, with some pollutants, sticky. Once diluted to the appropriate ratio, the sample is transported through a sample line (typically referred to as an umbilical) to a manifold from which individual analyzers may extract a sample. Gas analyzers employ various techniques to accurately measure concentrations. Some commonly used techniques include: infrared and ultraviolet adsorption, chemiluminescence, fluorescence and beta ray absorption. After analysis, the gas exits the analyzer to a common manifold to all analyzers where it is vented out of doors. A Data Acquisition and Handling System (DAHS) receives the signal output from each analyzer in order to collect and record emissions data. Another sample extraction method used in industrial sources and utility sources with low emission rates, is commonly referred to as the \\"hot dry\\" extractive method or \\"direct\\" CEMS. The sample is not diluted, but is carried along a heated sample line at high temperature into a sample conditioning unit. The sample is filtered to remove particulate matter and dried, usually with a chiller, to remove moisture. Once conditioned, the sample enters a sampling manifold and is measured using the same methods above. One advantage of this method is the ability to measure % oxygen in the sample, which is often required in the regulatory calculations for emission corrections. Since dilution mixes clean dry air with the sample, dilution systems cannot measure % oxygen.  Quality assurance  Accuracy of the system is demonstrated in several ways. An internal quality assurance check is achieved by daily introduction of a certified concentration of gas to the sample probe. The EPA also allows for the use of Continuous Emissions Monitoring Calibration Systems which dilute gases to generate calibration standards.\\"EPA Traceability Protocol for Assay and Certification of Gaseous Calibration Standards, \\"EPA-600/R93/224. Revised September 1993. The analyzer reading must be accurate to a certain percentage. The percent accuracy can vary, but most fall between 2.5% and 5%. In power stations affected by the Acid Rain Program, annual (or bi-annual) certification of the system must be performed by an independent firm. The firm will have an independent CEM system temporarily in place to collect emissions data in parallel with the plant CEMS. This testing is referred to as a Relative Accuracy Test Audit (RATA). In the U.S., periodic evaluations of the equipment must be reported and recorded. This includes daily calibration error tests, daily interference tests for flow monitors, and semi-annual (or annual) RATA and bias tests. CEMS equipment is expensive and not always affordable for a facility. In such cases, a facility will install non-EPA compliant analysis equipment at the emissions point. Once yearly, for the equipment evaluation, a mobile CEMS company measures emissions with compliant equipment. The results are then compared to the non-compliant analyzer system.

The simulator contains several models for structured (e.g. Chord, Kademlia, Pastry) and unstructured (e.g. GIA) peer-to- peer protocols. An example implementation of the framework is an implementation of a peer-to-peer SIP communications network. OverSim Features Some of the main features of the OverSim simulation framework include: Flexibility The simulator allows to simulate both structured and unstructured overlay networks (currently Chord, Pastry, Koorde, Broose, Kademlia, and GIA are implemented). The modular design and use of the Common API facilitate the extension with new features or protocols. Module behavior can easily be customized by specify parameters in a human readable configuration file. Interactive GUI In order to validate and debug new or existing overlay protocols you can make use of the GUI of OMNeT++, which visualizes networks topologies, messages and node state variables like the routing table. Exchangeable Underlying Network Models OverSim has a flexible underlying network scheme, which on the one hand provides a fully configurable network topology with realistic bandwidths, packet delays, and packet losses (INETUnderlay), and on the other hand a fast and simple alternative model for high simulation performance (SimpleUnderlay). Scalability OverSim was designed with performance in mind. On a modern desktop PC a typical Chord network of 10,000 nodes can be simulated in real- time. The simulator was used to successfully simulate networks of up to 100,000 nodes. Base Overlay Class The base overlay class facilitates the implementation of structured peer-to-peer protocols by providing a RPC interface, a generic lookup class and a common API key-based routing interface to the application. Reuse of Simulation Code The different implementations of overlay protocols are reusable for real network applications, so that researchers can validate the simulator framework results by comparing them to the results from real-world test networks like PlanetLab. Therefore, the simulation framework is able to handle and assemble real network packets and to communicate with other implementations of the same overlay protocol. Statistics The simulator collects various statistical data such as sent, received, or forwarded network traffic per node, successful or unsuccessful packet delivery, and packet hop count. Criticism The framework is outdated and requires an older version of the INET framework. Also, the code contains reported bugs.

It was originally developed by Eli Lilly and √âlan, and clinical trials were conducted by Eli Lilly. Phase III trials included over 3000 patients, but in August 2010, a disappointing interim analysis, in which semagacestat performed worse than the placebo, led to the trials being stopped.  Mechanism of action  Œ≤-Amyloid is a peptide of 39 to 43 amino acids. The isoforms with 40 and 42 amino acids (AŒ≤40/42) are the main constituents of amyloid plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. Œ≤-Amyloid is formed by proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Research on laboratory rats suggest that the soluble form of this peptide is a causative agent in the development of Alzheimer's. Semagacestat blocks the enzyme Œ≥-secretase, which (along with Œ≤-secretase) is responsible for APP proteolysis.  Clinical trials  Phase III double-blind clinical trials started in March 2008 with the IDENTITY study (Interrupting Alzheimer's dementia by evaluating treatment of amyloid pathology), including 1500 patients from 22 countries. This study was intended to run until May 2011. The successor trial with further 1500 patients, IDENTITY-2, started in September 2008. The open-label trial IDENTITY-XT, which included patients who have completed one of the two studies, started in December 2009. On 17 August 2010, it was announced that the phase III trials failed. Preliminary findings show that not only did semagacestat fail to slow disease progression, but that it was actually associated with ‚Äúworsening of clinical measures of cognition and the ability to perform activities of daily living‚Äù. Furthermore, the incidence of skin cancer was significantly higher in the treatment group than the placebo group.  Issues  A number of issues have already been raised during clinical trials: * Phase I and II studies showed a decrease of AŒ≤40/42 concentration in the blood plasma about three hours after application of semagacestat, but an increase of 300% 15 hours after application. No reduction was shown in the cerebrospinal fluid. As a consequence, the phase III studies worked with much higher doses. * Œ≥-Secretase has other targets, for example the notch receptor. It is not known whether this could cause long-term side effects. * In a 2008, histological analysis of post-mortem brains from deceased subjects who had previously been enrolled in a phase 1 study of an experimental vaccine (Elan AN1792) demonstrated that the drug appeared to have cleared patients of amyloid plaques but did not have any significant effect on their dementia, which in some people's mind cast doubt on the utility of approaches lowering Œ≤-amyloid levels. * A notable feature of the results of the semagacestat phase III interim analysis is that subjects on treatment did significantly worse in cognitive assessment and activities of daily living than did subjects in the placebo group. This contrasts with the results from the phase III trial of Myriad's Œ≥-secretase modulator tarenflurbil, which found that the subjects in the treatment group tracked the placebo control group very closely. The implications of this finding on other companies undertaking development of molecules targeting Œ≥-secretase is not clear.

Past Calder, it flows into Benewah County and through the town of St. Maries, where it receives its largest tributary, the Saint Maries River. It then turns northwest, passing through Heyburn State Park before reaching its mouth just north of the Kootenai County line.

About 68 percent is owned by the United States Forest Service (the St. Joe National Forest), 4 percent is owned by the Bureau of Land Management, 2 percent is owned by the State of Idaho, and the rest is privately owned. The Saint Joe River watershed is covered primarily by mixed coniferous forest, which includes species such as Douglas fir, true fir, larch, and pine. Alder is common in the riparian zones of high altitude river valleys, while cottonwood dominates the lower altitude riparian zones, much of which have been converted to agricultural land. Rush, sedge, and cattails are common in the river's floodplains, which are also used to grow wild rice.

Castalia uses the lognormal shadowing model as one of the ways to model average path loss, which has been shown to explain empirical data in WSN. It also models temporal variation of path loss in an effort to capture fading phenomena in changing environments (i.e., the nodes or parts of the environment are moving). Castalia's temporal variation modeling is designed to be fitted to measured data instead of making specific assumptions on the creation of fast fading. Other features of Castalia include: physical process modeling, sensing device bias and noise, node clock drift, and several MAC and routing protocols implemented.

It is part of the Total Force Initiative and works with the 157th Air Refueling Wing, New Hampshire Air National Guard. This was the first time that an active duty Air Force unit returned to Pease since the base was closed in 1991. On 9 January 2013, the Air Force announced that Pease would be in the running to host the first Boeing KC-46 Pegasus tankers as they entered service. In August 2014, Air Force leaders announced that the 157th would become the first Air National Guard unit to equip with the KC-46A. The Pegasus was scheduled to enter the Air Force inventory during fiscal year 2019; the first KC-46A arrived at Pease on 8 August 2019.

The charter of foundation is dated from the chateau d'Hardelot on 15 July, 1324; the church was consecrated in 1338. Early history The foundation, being close to Calais, was liable to disturbance in time of war. Thus it was often sacked by the English during the wars of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and was for a time abandoned. The religious returned when peace was restored. In 1542 the monastery was again wrecked by the Imperial troops and in the wars of religion fresh troubles attended the community. Finally the house was rebuilt by Dom Bernard Bruyant in the latter part of the seventeenth century and remained undisturbed until the French Revolution. In 1790 the monastery was suppressed and its property sold by auction the following year. Nineteenth century Eighty-two years later the Carthusians repurchased a portion of their old estate and the first stone of the new monastery was laid on 2 April 1872. The work was pushed forward by the Prior, Dom Eus√®be Bergier, and was finished in three years. The monastery contained twenty-four cells in its cloister. Montreuil took a special position among Carthusian houses, owing to the establishment there of a printing press from which has been issued a number of works connected with the order.

Both Sweden and Finland observed the bicentennial with various activities,Swedish 1809 website: \\"Kalendarium\\" (Swedish only) Retrieved 2011-06-23Finland's 1809 website: \\"The commemoration of Year 1809 culminated with various events\\" Retrieved 2011-06-23 which showed both the history of the partition and the close connection between the two countries since the mid 13th century.  Background  For 560 years, since the Second Swedish Crusade in 1249, Sweden and Finland had been one country; but after the Russian victory in the Finnish War 1808-1809, Sweden had to cede Finland to Russia at the Treaty of Fredrikshamn on 17 September 1809. Russia in turn made Finland the autonomous grand principality the Grand Duchy of Finland, a constitutional monarchy within the autocratic Russian Empire. Year 1809 was significant in many ways for both countries, beside being the year that separated Finland from Sweden. For Sweden, 1809 was also the birth year of modern Swedish constitutional monarchy, as the Constitution of 1809 returned Sweden to parliamentarism and put an end to the enlightened absolutism that Gustav III had introduced through a coup d'√©tat in 1772. It was also the year when the Parliamentary Ombudsman and the Committee on the Constitution were created. For Finland, the eventual realisation that it would never be reunited with Sweden, gave birth to Finnish nationalism, thus creating the foundation for the Finnish independence in 1917. The separation of Sweden and Finland had consequences outside the two countries. When the Finnish War started, after an attack from Russia in February 1808, Sweden had just started an invasion of Norway, having joined the British side in the Napoleonic Wars against France and its ally Denmark‚ÄìNorway. This two-front war was largely the reason for the loss against Russia. In 1812 and early 1813, the newly elected Swedish crown prince, the French marshal and former commander under Napoleon, Jean Baptiste Bernadotte held secret negotiations with both Russia, United Kingdom and Prussia, where he offered to join the battle against Napoleon in return for Sweden getting Norway as prize. They agreed, and in 1813 he allied Sweden with Napoleon's enemies of the Sixth Coalition in order to secure this. Charles John, as the Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Army, successfully defended the approaches to Berlin and was victorious in battle against Oudinot in August and against Ney in September at the Battles of Gro√übeeren and Dennewitz. But after the Battle of Leipzig he went his own way, determined at all hazards to cripple Denmark and to secure Norway, defeating the Danes at Bornh√∂ved in December. His efforts culminated in the Treaty of Kiel, where king Frederick VI of Denmark agreed to cede Norway to Sweden. The Norwegians weren't as keen, though, but after losing the Swedish-Norwegian War of 1814, Norway entered a personal union with Sweden which lasted until 1905, when Norway reached full independence.

It is categorized as being of least concern in the IUCN List of Threatened Species due to its wide range and stable population trend. Forest dormice have a diploid count (2n) of 48 chromosomes.Mitsainas, Georue GP. \\"Chromosomal Studies on Greek Populations of Four Small Rodent Species.\\" Folia Zoologica 57.4 (2008): 337-46. Even though this species lives in a variety of geographic locations, its greatest population density is in the forests of central Moldova, in Transcaucasia, and in the mountains of Central Asia. In most other locations, population density of this species is rather low. Population density is dependent on many factors. But the main features that this species depends on for choosing a location are the presence of the appropriate food sources as well as good foliage that can be used for a habitat. The reason why the forests in central Moldova have the highest population density is they provide the largest diversity of food sources which are available throughout the year. This location also provides the best type of foliage for the forest dormice to build their nests as well as swing from branches. The combination of both of these aspects allows for this species to have its highest needs met. Therefore, during mating season they produce offspring who also stay in the same general area when they mature. It makes sense not to move from an area if it is providing for your most basic needs. The common name for Eliomys is the garden dormouse. Dryomys are often compared to Eliomys as they have many similarities. However, Dryomys is smaller in size. Two more differences between the two are the braincase for Dryomys is more rounded and the auditory bullae is smaller than that of Eliomys. In addition, their tails are slightly different. The Dryomys's tail is more uniform in color than that of Eliomys.\\"Animal Diversity Web.\\" ADW: Dryomys Nitedula: INFORMATION. Web. 03 Dec. 2013. . The forest dormouse competes in artificial and natural nests with hazel dormice, fat dormice, and birds. Its biggest competitors are those species which eat similar types of food and who live in the same kind of habitat. Morphology Its appearance is squirrel- like. On average, the forest dormouse is 110 mm long with a fluffy grey tail nearly as long as its body. The head and body length can range from 80 mm to 130 mm, while the length of the tail can range from 60 mm to 113 mm. The range of its body mass is between 18 grams and 34 grams. The fur on the upper parts of the body is grayish-brown while the underparts are yellowish-white. A black stripe surrounds the eye and extends to the small ear. The whiskers form a bushy tuft about 10mm long. There are six pads on each paw. It has bilateral symmetry and is endothermic. Distribution and habitat The range of the forest dormouse is from Switzerland in the west, through central, eastern and southern Europe, the Balkan Peninsula, northward to the Baltic Sea and eastward to the Volga River and the Ural Mountains in Russia. Isolated populations occur outside this range, including in Israel, central Iran, Afghanistan, the Tien Shan mountains and Sinkiang in China. The forest dormouse lives in a wide range of habitats, including broad-leaved, mixed and coniferous woodlands. It is also found in rocky areas, dwarf montane woodland, evergreen shrubland and wood-steppe. It is reported to be found at altitudes up to 3,500 m. This species is most likely to be found in dense forests. Forest dormice tend to create their natal nests on top of lower tree branches or in the midst of thick shrubbery. These nests are usually one to seven meters above ground level. They are spherically shaped with a diameter between 150mm to 250mm. Typically these nests only have one entrance and it faces the tree trunk. The outside of the nest is made from leaves and twigs. The inside of the nest has a lining that is created from bark and moss pieces. Forest dormice tend to pay great attention to detail when they create these natal nests. They want to make sure their young are protected. Biology Depending on where this species is geographical located determines whether or not it hibernates and for how long. In Israel, forest dormice stay active throughout the year. However, during the winter they do go through a period of torpor for a certain amount of time each day. Forest dormice located in the north tend to hibernate from October until April. During this period of hibernation, northern dormice will sit on their back legs and curl up into a ball. Its tail will wrap around its body and its hands may touch its cheeks. In all hibernating species, body temperature decreases from the range of 35-37 ¬∞C to about 5 ¬∞C. Not much is known about the mating rituals of this species. It is known that this species is dependent on maternal care for the first couple of weeks after birth. Female forest dormice have eight mammary glands.\\"The Dormouse Hollow.\\" Dryomys. Web. 03 Dec. 2013. Forest dormice breed during various times of the year depending on their geographical location. For example, forest dormice who live in Israel have a breeding season that starts in March and lasts until December. However, in Europe breeding season is much shorter as it starts in March and only lasts until the end of August. There is a correlation between length of the breeding season and number of litters produced per year. For this reason, forest dormice who live in the south who have a longer breeding season usually produce two litters while the dormice who live in the north and have a very short breeding season usually only have time to produce one litter. The gestation period lasts about four weeks, and usually four or five young are born per litter. From time to time, it is possible for the female to give birth to up to seven young at one time. When the young are born, they weigh about 2 grams. The young dormice open their eyes at two weeks, and start eating solid food a week later. During the dependency period, the mother provides food, milk, grooming, and protection to the young. They leave the nest after about another three weeks and become sexually mature in the following year. There has not been much evidence for paternal care. However, it should not be ruled out. The average lifespan of forest dormice in the wild is five and a half years. The gender ratio is about 1:1, with insignificant predominance of females. Ecology When it comes out of hibernation in the spring, the forest dormouse eats small invertebrates, baby birds, buds, shoots and the green parts of plants. Later in the year, the dormouse predominately eats fruits, nuts and seeds. In fact, this species eats fruits from about twenty different tree and bush species including: apricots, apples, cherries, plums, cherry plums, pears, peaches, blackberries. The population does not fluctuate much because the young reared each year only just makes up for those that die during hibernation. Sixty percent of young individuals and the majority of elderly adults (over the age of four) do not survive the winter. Another cause of mortality is storms which may cause the death of juveniles in unprotected nests. Dormice are also preyed upon by pine marten, stone martens, wildcats, owls and crows. Two of its main predators are tawny owls (Strix aluco) and Eurasian eagle-owls (Bubo bubo). However, due to individuals being extremely careful not to travel away from brushy cover forest dormice are difficult prey to find.\\"Dryomys Nitedula.\\" Encyclopedia of Life. Web. 03 Dec. 2013. . Forest dormice are very aggressive. Not even in captivity are they tame. It has been noted that they may allow humans to pet them. However, when efforts are made to hold them, they bite with their sharp teeth. If agitated while resting they may wake up suddenly, leap high, spit, and hiss. Forest dormice may have a negative impact for humans due to raiding fruit orchards and chewing on the bark of coniferous trees. They have also been known to be vectors for such diseases as tick-borne encephalitis, leptospirosis, and possibly the Black Death. They may have a positive impact by controlling arthropod populations and scattering seeds. Behavior Forest dormice spend a great amount of time in trees. They are capable of climbing with excellent agility as well as leap to and from branches as great as 2 meters apart from one another. This species has a natural tendency to create temporary nests which are fragile. This species does not spend much time in these temporary nests because much more energy is placed in making the natal nests. This species is nocturnal. It is also very territorial. Adults live in low densities, usually only two to three per acre. Their territory range is from in diameter. Forest dormice produce a variety of noises for a variety of reasons. The most significant is the sound for an alarm call which is a melodious squeak. They also have the ability to produce ultrasounds which are used for communication. The different communication methods that forest dormice use are visual, tactile, acoustic, and chemical. It is not known exactly how these forms of communication are used specifically for this species. However, it is known that most mammals use tactile communication during mating, conflict, and raising young. Chemical communication can play a significant role in being able to identify a specific individual. Visual cues are given off by body posture as a way to designate whether it is a hostile or friendly environment. The different perception methods that forest dormice use are visual, tactile, ultrasound, and chemical. Status This species is considered endangered in the Czech Republic and as rare in a majority of the other European countries. The population is mostly threatened by the destruction of forests which is their habitat. There are many programs in place to help maintain and increase the forest dormice population. There is an international law to protect this species and it is under the EU Habitats and Species Directive (Annex IV) and the Berne Convention (Appendix III). All countries must abide by this law. In addition, a country may choose to create a national law or program in order to further provide methods to make sure this species is protected. For example, the English government rewards farmers who replant hedges. Hopefully, this will increase available shrubbery for dormice to occupy. Another program is administered by English Nature. This is a reintroduction program whose purpose is to place captive-bred dormice in locations where the population has been dwindling. In addition to these programs, the UK has created a National Dormouse Monitoring Programme. Its main purpose is to observe hazel dormice. However, the program components are used to observe and track all species of dormice. Ancestry Recently, a fossil of a dormouse-like mammal was discovered. This fossil is thought to be the earliest eutherian ancestor. The fossil was complete and well preserved in a lake bed located in China. It was given the name Eomaia, which means ancient mother. The fossil has skeletal features that are closer to modern placentals than to marsupials. This is significant as it indicates the split between these two groups that occurred more than 125 million years ago. Before this fossil was discovered, the oldest recorded fossil of a placental mammal was teeth aging 110 million years old. The oldest skull and skeleton fossil for a placental mammal is only 75 million years old.

It is the most popular Sindhi folk form of entertainment. History Bhagat developed through the years. Its origin could be traced to the ancient bards who wandered through the countryside singing and narrating the old heroic ballads of the lovers and warriors of the olden times. The Sindhi Bhagat acquired its distinct form over a century ago, gradually developing into the current popular source of cultural entertainment. Its performances became more professional and it became a collectively created folk-art form. Performance The pivotal character in the performance is the \\"Bhagat\\", after whom the art form is named. He is the prime dancer, the storyteller, and the soul of the performance. The others are the \\"Boldias\\" (supporting players) and also the players of musical instruments such as harmonium, tabla, dholak, khanjri, etc., simple rhythmical instruments. The Bhagat combines the finer qualities of different performing arts in such an effective and appealing order that the audience are kept spellbound for hours together, because the Bhagat is supposed to start late in the evening, when the village or town folk have taken their night meal and are ready to sit till the early hours of the next morning. Men, women and children partake of the bewitching pleasure of the performance, often sitting through the night. The Bhagat with his melodious voice, the delicate rhythm of his steps, body movements and very effective dramatised storytelling, keeps the audience glued to their seats without even blinking their eyes throughout the show. He has a variegated voice, creating different moods ‚Äì be it pathos, agony, humour, melody, glory, or tragedy as required for the narration. He moves the hearts of his audience, bringing laughter or tears as the situation demands. Sindhi Bhagat today Bhagat is the most important and integral part of Sindhi folk-art, a rich cultural heritage of the Sindhi community and widely acclaimed. There were once scores of these versatile artists in the countryside as well as in the urban pockets of Sind. However, after partition of the country this folk art is on the decline due to a variety of reasons, including the influence of electronic mass media and socio-economic compulsion.

The malt is used in brewing beer, whisky and in certain foods. The traditional malt house was largely phased out during the twentieth century in favour of more mechanised production. Many malt houses have been converted to other uses, such as Snape Maltings which is now a concert hall. Production process   Floor malting  The grain was first soaked in a steeping pit or cistern for a day or more. This was constructed of brick or stone, and was sometimes lined with lead. It was rectangular and no more than deep. Soon after being covered with water, the grain began to swell and increase its bulk by 25 percent. The cistern was then drained and the grain transferred to another vessel called a couch, either a permanent construction, or temporarily formed with wooden boards. Here it was piled deep, and began to generate heat and start to germinate. It spent a day or two here, according to the season and the maltster's practice. Highland Park Distillery It was then spread out on the growing floor, the depth dictated by the temperature, but sufficiently deep to encourage vegetation. It was turned at intervals to achieve even growth and over the next fourteen days or so it is turned and moved towards the kiln. The temperature was also controlled by ventilation. A day or two after the grain was turned out on to the floor, an agreeable smell was given off, and roots soon began to appear. A day or so later the future stem began to swell, and the kernel became friable and sweet-tasting. As the germination proceeded the grain was spread thinner on the floor. The process was halted before the stem burst the husk. At this stage much of the starch in the grain had been converted to maltose and the grain was left on the floor to dry. The art of malting depends on the proper regulation of these changes in the grain. Maltsters varied in their manner of working, and adapted to changes in climatic conditions. The barley was then moved into the kiln, , for between two and four days, depending on whether a light or dark malt was required. A slow fire was used to start, and then gradually raised to suit the purpose of the malt and the desired colour. The barley was then sieved to remove the shoots and stored for a few months to develop flavour.  Saladin malting  Filling a Saladin box, Sangerhausen The Saladin system of mechanical and pneumatic malting was designed for a high performance process. The inventor Charles Saladin was a French engineer. The barley is soaked for an hour to remove swimming barley. This is followed by two hours of soaking to remove attached particles and dust. The next step is a prewashing by water circulation for 30 minutes followed by washing with fresh water and removing the overfall. A dry soak with CO2 exhaustion during 4 hours follows. Several dry and wet soaking steps are to follow. The last step is the transfer to the saladin box.  Steep, Germinate and Kilning Vessel  While in the traditional malt houses the product flow is horizontal, the flow in the Steep, Germinate and Kilning Vessel is vertical. Due to high capital costs this process is used only in industrial maltings for beer malt. Malt houses in the United Kingdom Snape Maltings, photographed in 1975; it dates from the 19th century Langley Maltings, photographed in 2007 before damage by fire Many villages had a malt house in the eighteenth century, supplying the needs of local publicans, estates and home brewers. Malt houses are typically long, low buildings, no more than two storeys high, in a vernacular style. The germination of barley is hindered by high temperatures, so many malt houses only operated in the winter. This provided employment for agricultural workers whose labour was not much in demand during the winter months. During the nineteenth century many small breweries disappeared. Improved techniques allowed larger breweries and specialist maltsters to build their own maltings and operate year-round. These were often housed in multi-storey buildings. It was also more efficient to transport malt than barley to the brewery, so many large breweries set up their own maltings near railways in the barley growing districts of eastern England. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, pneumatic malting was introduced, in which the barley is aerated and the temperature carefully controlled, accelerating the germination. Large malting floors were no longer necessary, but power consumption was high, so floor malting held on well into the twentieth century. Only a handful of traditional malting floors are still in use.

The rate for malted barley was 6d. per bushel in 1697 and had risen to 2s. 7d. in 1834. In 1789 the malt tax raised ¬£ million, 11.5% of all taxes. In 1802 the malt duty rose from 1s. 4d. a bushel to 2s. 5d., then to 4s. 5d. in 1804, driven upwards by the need to finance the French Wars of 1793‚Äì1815. In 1865 the total revenue was reported to be six million sterling a year. There were also numerous regulations in place regarding the malting process. The cistern and the couch- frame had to be constructed in a particular manner, to permit the excise officer to gauge the grain. The maltster had to give notice before wetting any grain; 24 hours in the city or market-town, 48 hours elsewhere. The grain had to be kept covered with water for 48 hours, excepting one hour for changing the water. Grain could only be put in the cistern between 8am and 2pm, and taken out between 7am and 4pm. It had to remain in the couch frame for at least 26 hours. Once thrown out of the cistern, it could not be sprinkled for 12 days. A survey book or ledger had to be kept to record the process and the gauging of the grain in the cistern, the couch, and on the floor. The volume of the grain was carefully measured, based upon the mean width, length and height, and calculated by mental arithmetic, pen and paper, or slide rule. The duty to be charged was based upon the largest gauge of either the cistern, couch or floor after a multiplying factor of 1.6 was applied to the larger of the cistern or couch gauges.

Originally built at Ferrol in Galicia for the Spanish Navy in 1782‚Äì83, she was captured from the Spanish Navy at the Battle of Cape St Vincent on 14 February 1797 (when she was still named in Spanish San Jos√©). In 1809 she served as the flagship of Admiral John Thomas Duckworth.p.13, Sconce  Battle of Cape St Vincent  The San Jos√© was among the Spanish fleet during the battle, during which HMS Captain, under the command of Captain Horatio Nelson came out of the line to attack the San Nicol√°s. After exchanging fire, Nelson led his forces aboard the San Nicol√°s. While the English were fighting their way aboard the San Jos√© continued to fire upon the Captain and the San Nicol√°s. The San Jos√© then fell upon the San Nicol√°s and their rigging became tangled. Trapped, the men from the San Jos√© continued to fire on the British boarding parties with muskets and pistols. Nelson then took his men from the decks of the San Nicol√°s aboard the San Jos√©, forcing the Spanish to surrender, with their Admiral badly injured. The San Jos√© and the San Nicol√°s, both captured by Nelson, were two of the four ships captured during the battle. After their capture they were renamed HMS San Josef and HMS San Nicolas respectively. The feat of using one enemy vessel as a 'stepping stone' to capture another was afterwards known in the Royal Navy as \\"Nelson's patent bridge for boarding first rates\\".  Later career  From 1839 San Josef was used as a gunnery training ship. From 10 August 1841 she was commanded by Captain Joseph Needham Tayler, serving as a guard ship at Devonport (established gunnery school). Other captains who served in her include: Captain Frederick William Burgoyne, while serving as the flagship of Samuel Pym, Plymouth; Captain Henry John Leeke; and Captain Thomas Maitland, as the flagship of Admiral William Hall Gage, Devonport. She was broken up a Devonport in May 1849. Some small pieces of the San Josef still survive to this day. One is in the form of part of a wooden gun carriage; called a Quoin. This quoin can be found among the Valhalla figurehead collection in Tresco Abbey Gardens in the Isles of Scilly. Another is a carved Triumph of Arms from the stern rail sold at Bonhams in London in October 2014. Parts of the ship were used in the re-building of St Nicholas' Church, West Looe in 1852. Legacy San Josef Mountain on the South Coast of British Columbia, on the south side of Estero Basin on Frederick Arm to the west of the mouth of Bute Inlet, was named in 1864 by Captain Pender for the San Josef, while Departure Bay and Nanaimo Harbour at the city of Nanaimo were originally named (in 1791) the Bocas de Winthuysen after Rear-Admiral Don Francisco Xavier Winthuysen. San Josef Bay in Cape Scott Provincial Park at the north end of Vancouver Island is also named after this ship.  References  * Sconce, Robert Clement, Life and Letters of R. C.

Located at One Government Center, and constructed directly over Interstate 195, it was the first public building built over a Federal interstate highway.Bostonroads.com I-195 It replaced the city's historic 19th century city hall which had been demolished in the early 1960s as part of the construction of Interstate 195, which cuts through the center of the city's downtown area. Delayed and plagued by problems during construction, the new city hall opened in 1976. In 2008, the building and site underwent a multimillion-dollar exterior renovation. Location The current Fall River Government Center is located at the historic \\"crossroads\\" of the city, at the intersection of Central Street (Bedford Street) and Main Street. Fall River's first town hall was destroyed in the first great downtown fire of 1843, which destroyed over 200 buildings in the center of town. Old city hall Old City Hall The city's historic 19th century city hall was demolished in 1962 for construction of Interstate 195, which cut through the heart of downtown Fall River. It was a time of so-called \\"urban renewal\\" in the city after the tough years since the collapse of the city's textile industry in the 1920s and 1930s. Several other 19th and early 20th century buildings were also demolished as part of the new highway construction. The old city hall, which had survived two fires was constructed directly over the Quequechan River, the source of power for the early textile mills. As part of the highway project, the river was diverted into an underground culvert which parallels the highway, along the south side of the current city hall. Two granite columns from the front of the old city hall are located across from the current building, along Sullivan Drive, next to the Academy Building. The eagle which topped the spire of the old city hall is currently located in the foyer of the new building. Current building Government Center The new Government Center (city hall), constructed of reinforced concrete and glass, in the popular Brutalist style of the 1960s and 1970s opened in 1976, after years of construction delays and quality control problems. The main buildings occupies a space further east than the original city hall, which was closer to South Main Street. A wing of the current building, which contains the city council chambers is located at the west end of the site, closer to South Main Street. A plaza was created north of the new city hall, between the adjacent United States Post Office. The original scheme for the new city hall included a parking garage, that was later eliminated from the design. The main building is a concrete cube, approximately 144 feet (44 m) square,Patriot Properties with a smaller glass-enclosed cube forming the middle floors. The building is set atop an elevated \\"basement\\" containing mechanical and storage areas constructed atop the steel platform which spans the highway. The platform also includes South Main Street to the west and Second Street to the east, creating a 900-foot (274 m) long tunnel. 1999 tunnel incident In March 1999, several concrete slabs, which formed the ceiling of the tunnel beneath Government Center, fell onto the westbound lanes of Interstate 195. Although six vehicles crashed, including a minivan which overturned, nobody was killed in the accident. It was later determined that the support brackets which held the concrete slabs had corroded; as a result, state highway officials ordered the immediate removal of all of the concrete ceiling panels beneath Government Center.Slab falls from tunnel, shuts Fall River highway With the slabs removed, the underside of Government Center became vulnerable to fire in the event of an accident within the tunnel. State and local officials therefore decided that all trucks carrying hazardous cargo, such as gasoline or oil, would not be allowed to pass along the interstate beneath the building. For several years, these vehicles were detoured through the city streets around Government Center. In May 2008, with the replacement of the concrete panels complete, this restriction was removed.

Overview  The museum is part of the Department of Cultural Analysis of the Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK). The museum's four extensive collections (Poster, Graphics, Design and Applied Art) are of international importance. The Museum of Design is located in Z√ºrich's Kreis 5, close to Z√ºrich Hauptbahnhof. Parts of its collections are housed opposite the museum's main building on Limmatstrasse (the Plakatraum, or Poster Collection), and in a commercial building on F√∂rrlibuckstrasse (the Design Collection and Graphics Collection). Until January 2017, the museum also operated the Museum Bellerive, located in a former villa on the shores of Lake Zurich. Since 2018, the city operates the Z√ºrcher Architekturzentrum (Zurich Center for Architecture) in the former villa. History and buildings Situated in Zurich's former School of Arts and Crafts the Museum of Design's main building contains an exhibition hall, gallery, reception area, cafeteria, shop and the vestibule to the lecture hall. The Museum of Design developed out of the Museum of Arts and Crafts, which was founded in 1875. In 1933, the museum and the School of Arts and Crafts (today known as the Zurich University of the Arts) moved into its present building designed by Adolf Steger and Karl Egender. In its combination of aesthetic and functional qualities, the building exemplifies the Modern Architecture movement in Switzerland. In 1968 the Museum of Design acquired the former home of the textile manufacturer Julian Bloch and moved part of its Applied Art collection into it. Renamed the Museum Bellerive, the building housed the collection of glass, ceramic, wood, metal and textiles until 2017, when the museum was closed. Its collection was moved to a new location at Toni Areal, a building complexed opened in 2014 which is shared with the University of the Arts and the University of Applied Sciences. Exhibitions The Museum of Design shows between five and seven temporary exhibitions annually in the hall and the gallery of the main building, small interventions within the museum, and temporary exhibitions at Toni Areal and in the Plakatraum. Most of the exhibitions shown in the Museum of Design are produced in-house and are developed in dialogue with the museum collections or through research projects. Exhibitions loaned from other institutions make up a small part of the exhibition program. Exhibitions are accompanied by a program of tours, symposia, panel discussions, talks with artists, film and theatre performances and concerts. A specifically tailored educational program is devised for each exhibition. Collections The four collections of the Museum of Design emerged from a teaching collection amassed by the Museum of Arts and Crafts. Poster Collection (Plakatraum) The Poster Collection comprises 330,000 posters (of which 120,000 have been photographed and indexed) and documents the international history of the poster from its mid-19th-century origins to the present day. The collection includes political, cultural and commercial posters. For reasons explicable in terms of design history the geographical focal points are Switzerland, Europe, Japan, Cuba, the former Soviet Union and the United States. Design Collection  The Design Collection includes 10,000 products and 20,000 examples of packaging produced by famous designers, as well as representative examples of anonymous everyday design. Mass-produced products from the 20th century and the present are collected, with emphasis placed on Swiss design. Through its permanent loans from the field of product design (an area that has been subsidized by the Swiss Federal Office of Culture since 1989) the Swiss Confederation makes available objects that pertain to the current design discourse. Parallel to the collection of objects, an archive for Swiss Design is being built up that benefits and assists scholarly research in the field. The archive contains concepts, project studies, design drawings, user guides, patent specifications, advertising material and source texts, as well as parts of the archives of design studios, companies and associations.  Graphics Collection  The Graphics Collection has existed since the museum was founded. It documents the aesthetic and cultural transformation of graphics in everyday life from Gutenberg to the present. Originally intended as an international collection of examples, the Graphics Collection includes almost all graphic disciplines that were of importance for teaching at the former School of Arts and Crafts. The core was initially formed by drawings, prints and illustrated books, as well as textbooks from the 15th to the 20th century. Press work, East Asian works, artists books, photographs and commercial art were added later. Today collecting concentrates on advertising and information graphics, fonts, typography and book design. The collection is developed further by acquiring current works by innovative graphic designers, advertising agencies, the legacies of important designers as well as examples of the corporate design of important companies.  Applied Art Collection  Museum Bellerive situated on Lake Z√ºrich shore in Z√ºrich-Seefeld The Applied Art Collection includes over 15,000 pieces. Originally assembled as a study collection by the Museum of Art and Design, the collection contains diverse objects in the areas of glass, ceramics, textiles and furniture spanning the 19th and 20th centuries. In geographical terms, it concentrates on Europe, the USA and modern Japan.

This is in contrast to the effective rate of interest, which expresses the amount of interest as a percentage of the balance at the start of the period. The discount rate is commonly used for U.S. Treasury bills and similar financial instruments. For example, consider a government bond that sells for $95 and pays $100 in a year's time. The discount rate is : \\\\frac{100-95}{100} = 5.00\\\\% The interest rate is calculated using 95 as the base : \\\\frac{100-95}{95} = 5.26\\\\% For every effective interest rate, there is a corresponding effective discount rate, given by : d = \\\\frac{i}{1+i} or inversely, : i = \\\\frac{d}{1-d} Given the above equation relating \\\\,d to \\\\,i it follows that : d = \\\\frac{1+i}{1+i} - \\\\frac{1}{1+i}\\\\ = 1-v where v is the discount factor or equivalently, : v = 1-d Since \\\\, d = iv ,it can readily be shown that : id = i-d Annual discount rate convertible \\\\,pthly A discount rate applied \\\\,p times over equal subintervals of a year is found from the annual effective rate d as :1-d = \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{d^{(p)}}{p}\\\\right)^p where \\\\,d^{(p)} is called the annual nominal rate of discount convertible \\\\,pthly. :1-d = \\\\exp (-d^{(\\\\infty)}) \\\\,d^{(\\\\infty)}=\\\\delta is the force of interest. The rate \\\\,d^{(p)} is always bigger than d because the rate of discount convertible \\\\,pthly is applied in each subinterval to a smaller (already discounted) sum of money. As such, in order to achieve the same total amount of discounting the rate has to be slightly more than 1/pth of the annual rate of discount. Business calculations Businesses consider this discount rate when deciding whether to invest profits to buy equipment or whether to deliver the profit to shareholders. In an ideal world, they would buy a piece of equipment if shareholders would get a bigger profit later. The amount of extra profit a shareholder requires to prefer that the company buy the equipment rather than giving them the profit now is based on the shareholder's discount rate. A common way of estimating shareholders' discount rates uses share price data is known as the capital asset pricing model. Businesses normally apply this discount rate by calculating the net present value of the decision.

A relative of noted conductor Sergei Koussevitzky, he made many recordings in Poland and the United States.Pasternak, Velvel. The Jewish music companion, Hal Leonard Corporation, 2003, , p. 69. Moshe Koussevitzky was a lyric tenor with a spectacular and perhaps unparalleled upper register among cantors. Koussevitzky is regarded as among the greatest cantors of the 20th century. Some would place him first among peers, though that distinction is more often given to Yossele Rosenblatt or Gershon Sirota, both of whom were a generation older than Koussevitzky. Koussevitzky was born in Smarho≈Ñ, now located in Belarus, on June 9, 1899; his father, Avigdor, was a music teacher and his mother, Alta, a pianist. He moved to Vilna in 1920, and served there as cantor at the Sawel Synagogue, and, starting in 1924, at the Great Synagogue of Vilna. In 1927 or 1928 he became cantor of the Tlomackie Synagogue in Warsaw, succeeding Gershon Sirota. He soon gained an international reputation, traveling to Brussels, Antwerp, Vienna, Budapest and London. In 1934 and 1936, he performed in Palestine. Koussevitzky first performed in the United States in 1938, at New York's Carnegie Hall. Koussevitzky and his family escaped the Nazis during the Holocaust by fleeing to the Soviet Union. During the war years, he performed as an opera singer under the name Mikhail Koswitzky, appearing in Boris Godunov, Tosca and Rigoletto, and was honored for his contributions to national morale. After the war, he returned to Poland, and the audience at one of his concerts included the ambassadors from the United Kingdom and the United States. Following this concert he was granted a visa to the United Kingdom, where he stayed for a short time before emigrating in 1947 to the United States with his family. He became cantor of Borough Park, Brooklyn's Temple Beth-El in 1952, living in Great Neck, Long Island during the week and in Borough Park on the Sabbath. He died on August 23, 1966, and was buried in Israel. Koussevitzky was one of four brothers, all well-known cantors. David Koussevitzky was cantor of a Conservative synagogue, Temple Emanu-El of Borough Park, one block from Moshe's Beth-El. After Moshe's death, David would continue the tradition Moshe had started of giving an annual concert at Beth-El on Rosh Chodesh Elul, one month before Rosh Hashanah. Jacob and Simcha were also prominent cantors, albeit not as well known as Moshe and David. Jacob held positions in Kremenetze, Lemberg, London, Winnipeg, and finally Kew Gardens Hills, Queens, New York.

Playing career Fulghum began his career in 1998 playing at junior level for the Waterloo Black Hawks in Waterloo, Iowa. The Black Hawks are a Tier 1 junior level hockey team, but despite the high standard, Fulghum adapted well, playing in 52 USHL games and scoring 30 points. His production would improve the following season to a point per game in a 47-game spell, helping the Black Hawks into the post-season. In his final season in Waterloo, Fulghum featured in 21 games and scored 31 points before being traded mid-season to the Dubuque Fighting Saints, fierce rivals to the Black Hawks. Again Fulghum would consistently score points, managing 31 points in 34 games to the end of the season. For the 2001‚Äì02 season, Fulghum would move into college hockey, signing for the University of Denver in his home state of Colorado. In his first season at NCAA level, Fulghum took time to adapt but established himself as a regular player, scoring 12 points in 35 games. This would improve in the 2002‚Äì03 season to 28 points in 40 games. After four productive seasons in Denver, Fulghum would total 112 points and move on to the ill-fated AHL St. John's Maple Leafs, but would move on after just two games. He would split the 2005‚Äì06 season between the ECHL Pensacola Ice Pilots and the AHL Toronto Marlies. Fulghum would again play for the Marlies in the 2006‚Äì07 season, but spent the majority of the season again at ECHL level, this time with the Columbia Inferno. For 2007‚Äì08, Fulghum became a Bridgeport Sound Tigers player, but again failed to establish himself, playing just once before returning to ECHL level. This would be with the Stockton Thunder. After just five games another mid-season move would ensue, this time to the Elmira Jackals. With a regular run in the team, Fulghum again found his scoring touch, with 24 points in 34 games, totals that would push the Jackals into the post-season where Fulghum would score 4 points in 6 games prior to the Jackals elimination. In the summer of 2008, Fulghum made the decision to play his hockey in Europe for the first time, signing for the EIHL Manchester Phoenix, a team icing at the highest level of hockey in the United Kingdom. The deal was announced in August 2008 by head coach Tony Hand. Fulghum's first season in UK ice hockey was a positive one which showed off his high work-rate and point scoring ability - Fulghum would score 84 points in just 67 games. At the end of the season due to off-ice financial problems the Phoenix would choose to play in the EPL instead, meaning they could not keep Fulghum on their roster due to him not having a dual passport. He opted to remain in the EIHL and in June 2009 signed for the Coventry Blaze. He was released from his contract with the Coventry Blaze on December 1, 2011, and was immediately snapped up by the Sheffield Steelers On June 21, 2012, Fulghum signed with the Denver Cutthroats for their 2012‚Äì13 inaugural season. In doing so, he became the second player in franchise history to join the team, following defenseman Aaron MacKenzie. After a solitary season with the Cutthroats in which he contributed with 20 goals and 53 points in 65 games, and after initially re- signing with the Cutthroats for another year, Fulgham switched over to cross- town competitors the Colorado Eagles of the ECHL on September 12, 2013.

Located on Crescent Street and the banks of the Charles River, the surviving elements of its manufacturing facility date from the 1870s to the 1910s, and include particularly fine industrial Romanesque architecture. The buildings have been converted to a variety of commercial, industrial and residential uses since they ceased being used for watchmaking in the 1950s. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The Waltham Watch factory complex is located southwest of downtown Waltham, in South Waltham. It occupies about on the south bank of the Charles River, bounded on the north by Prospect Street, the east by Crescent Street, and the south by wood-frame residential and commercial properties. Its buildings extend for nearly , with four above-ground floors and a basement level. Built out of red brick, the facades are dominated by rows of large sash windows set in segmented-arch openings. The complex has several different roof treatments, as well as several towers, turrets, and corner finials, giving it a remarkably unified Romanesque appearance. The earliest incarnation of the Waltham Watch Company was founded on this site in 1854, and demonstrated the complete creation of a watch under a single roof. The company went through a number of management and ownership changes, and was known as the American Waltham Watch Company when the first buildings of this facility were constructed beginning in 1879, when some of the first buildings were demolished. They were lauded at the time as model facilities, dedicated to the safety and hygiene of the workers, and included amenities such as daycare facilities that were unusual for the time. Major modifications to the plant ended in 1913, and the plant was shutdown about 1962, after a series of financial difficulties and ownership changes. Following the demise of watch manufacturing, the complex was leased out in portions to light manufacturing industries. Panametrics, a manufacturer of precision equipment, occupied much of the premises until its acquisition in 2004 by General Electric. The complex has since then undergone an environmentally friendly conversion to mixed residential and commercial/industrial use.

Tanenbaum (1925‚Äì1992) was a human rights and social justice activist and rabbi. He was known for building bridges with other faith communities to advance mutual understanding and co-operation and to eliminate entrenched stereotypes, particularly ones rooted in religious teachings.Banki, Judith H. \\"Biographical Sketch.\\" A Prophet for Our Time. Eds. Judith H. Banki and Eugene J. Fisher. New York: Fordham University Press, 2002, xix He was an advocate during the Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì1965) on behalf of what eventually emerged as Nostra aetate. The landmark document overturned a long tradition of hostility toward Jews and Judaism, including the charge that the Jews were responsible for the death of Jesus; affirmed the Jewish roots of Christianity; established a new policy of outreach in dialogue to Jews; and set out a new course for Catholic-Jewish relations.Banki, Judith H. \\"Biographical Sketch.\\" A Prophet for Our Time, xiv‚Äìxxv. Tanenbaum was dubbed \\"the human rights rabbi\\" for his work on behalf of Vietnamese boat people and Cambodian refugees. He also helped to organize humanitarian relief for victims of the Nigerian Civil War.Banki, Judith H. \\"Biographical Sketch.\\" A Prophet for Our Time, xix. Early life The son of poor Orthodox Jewish Ukrainian immigrants, Tanenbaum grew up in Baltimore. He excelled in school, graduating with a scholarship to attend Yeshiva University, in New York City.Banki, Judith H. ‚ÄúBiographical Sketch‚Äù. A Prophet for Our Time, xx. He pursued both premedical rabbinical studies. Upon graduating from Yeshiva University, he was accepted into medical school, but after only one day of classes, he realized that medicine was not the path for him. Always interested in writing, both creative and journalistic, he found work at a weekly newsletter. A chance encounter with a former classmate, Harold M. Schulweis, who later became a distinguished rabbi and author, led to Tanenbaum to apply successfully to the Jewish Theological Seminary.Banki, Judith H. ‚ÄúBiographical Sketch‚Äù. A Prophet for Our Time, xxi. At the seminary, he pursued his interests in both Judaism and journalism, writing for The Eternal Light, a radio show produced by the seminary. Career After his ordination, Tanenbaum knew that he wanted to serve the Jewish community but not in what capacity. He worked in various positions as a writer and editor, and for a time, he was the religion writer for Time magazine. In 1952, he became director of the Synagogue Council of America, which was formed to represent the combined voices of Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform Judaism in the United States for policy and intergroup relations.Banki, Judith H. ‚ÄúBiographical Sketch‚Äù. A Prophet for Our Time, xxii. There, he forged contacts with Christian leaders, including televangelists and Greek Orthodox primates. Notably befriending Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., he became involved in national public affairs. He served as the vice president of the White House Conference on Children and Youth, where he invited Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel to deliver a major paper. The intersection of religion and public policy had a particular appeal for Tanenbaum, who saw it as a fertile field for interreligious co-operation. He believed that Jews needed to take an active role in public life to prevent marginalization and to counter anti-Semitism. In 1983, Tanenbaum became director of International Affairs of the American Jewish Committee (AJC), where he focused on issues of human rights and humanitarian work.Banki, Judith H. ‚ÄúBiographical Sketch‚Äù. A Prophet for Our Time, xxiv. During his career as director of first Interreligious and then International Affairs at the AJC, Tanenbaum won public recognition. The magazine Newsweek dubbed him \\"the American Jewish community's foremost apostle to the gentiles,\\" and the New York Magazine called him \\"the foremost Jewish ecumenical leader in the world today.\\" In a poll of newspaper editors ranking the ten most respected and influential religious leaders in America, he came in fourth. He served on the boards of various institutions, including the American Jewish World Service, the International Rescue Committee, the Overseas Development Council, the United Nations Association, the National Peace Academy, the A. Philip Randolph Institute, and Covenant House. He was the founder and chairman of the National Interreligious Task Force on Soviet Jewry. Under the directorship of Ann Gillen, it vigorously pursued the cause of the Soviet Union's oppressed Jews and Christians. He was awarded 15 honorary degrees and was honored by the International Council of Christians and Jews and the New York Board of Rabbis. Tanenbaum was known for his weekly radio broadcasts that addressed current events with commentary. He also wrote editorials and articles directed to the Jewish community, upholding the value of interreligious dialogue. Tanenbaum‚Äôs first marriage in 1955 to Helga Weiss ended in divorce in 1977. They had two daughters, Adina and Susan, and a son, Michael. He was married in 1982 to Dr. Georgette Bennett, an author, broadcast journalist, criminologist, and business consultant.Banki, Judith H. ‚ÄúBiographical Sketch‚Äù. A Prophet for Our Time, xxvii. Death He died in 1992 of heart failure, at the age of 66, seven weeks before the birth of his son Joshua-Marc Tanenbaum. In 1993, his widow Dr. Bennett launched the Rabbi Marc H.

The company was founded in 1877 as a spin- off from the successful American Watch Company, and was used for the production of watchmaking tools until 1904. The four-building complex traces the evolutionary history of this business. The factory was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The American Watch Tool Company complex is located on the west side of Elm Street, a short way south of the Charles River. This complex of four connected buildings was built up between 1877 and 1916. All four buildings are two stories, and are built of brick. The largest building, dating to 1901, stands closest to the street; it is seven bays wide, six of which have windows set in segmented-arch openings at the two main levels, with smaller similar windows at the basement level. An entrance occupies the rightmost bay. The American Watch Tool Company was established as a spinoff of the American Watch Company, Waltham's leading business of the late 19th century. The company was established by tool makers, many of whom had learned precision machining in other manufacturing areas, who then produced tools for use by other watch makers. This facility was used in that business until 1904, expanding the premises in 1879 and 1882. and was thereafter used by the Metz Company for the manufacture of automobiles. By 1950 the property was owned by the Belgian Spinning Company.

He was active in the period 1356-1399 and is mainly known for his panel paintings. He specialized in religious-themed works, many of which have survived. Life Giovanni del Biondo‚Äôs precise date of birth is unknown.Artist Biography: Giovanni del Biondo (Florence, active 1356-1399) at the University of Delaware, accessed 22 March 2016 From tax records it is known that Giovanni del Biondo lived and flourished in Florence where he died in 1399. He may have trained in the workshop of Andrea and Nardo di Cione where he also worked at the start of his career.Brendan Cassidy. \\"Giovanni del Biondo.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 22 March 2016 Work His earliest surviving works are frescoes. These works clearly bear the mark of the influence of Giotto's style. He later started making tempera paintings on panel. These works often show the influence of the works of Ambrogio Lorenzetti, Andrea di Cione, Jacopo di Cione and Bernardo Daddi. Nearly all of Biondo‚Äôs paintings depict religious subjects and were originally part of large-scale polyptych altarpieces. From the Saint Sebastian Triptych His earliest works are simple compositions with bright colors and typically lack dimensional depth. Gradually Biondo's figures gained more ornamentation and detail and a more naturalistic appearance. The figures also became more spontaneous in their arrangements. In his later paintings, Biondo paid more attention to foreground and background details in his composition. He created a greater sense of depth but his figures became more formalized and hardened. The idiosyncrasies of his style include the wayward proportions, sharp, spiky features and a strong sense of design.Giovanni del Biondo (d. 1399), The Virgin Annunciate c.1385-90, at the Royal Collection Trust, accessed 22 March 2016 There are only two surviving altarpieces that bear his signature. Because of his distinctive style it has been possible to confidently ascribe a significant number of works to the artist. His style remained the same in his later career. The use of studio assistants with various levels of proficiency in his later period led to a certain loss in quality.There are two paragons of Giovanni del Biondo's style of painting in the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto (\\"Vision of Saint Benedict\\", \\"Saint Benedict Restores Life to Monk\\").

The learning and skills sector is vital to increasing productivity, economic competitiveness and sustainable employment in the UK Learning and skills also refers to the actual learning which learners undertake and the skills they acquire.  Responsibility for learning and skills  Funding of provision is subject to frequent change. The former Learning and Skills Council (2001-2010) was replaced by the Skills Funding Agency (still operating April 2012) and the Young People's Learning Agency (now closed and incorporated into the Education Funding Agency from April 2012). It is wise to consult government department websites - Department for Education, and DBIS, for updated information.  Providers of learning and skills  The learning and skills sector is made up of a number of different training providers, such as colleges and private organisations, and also includes workplace learning and offender learning.  Further education colleges and adult education institutes  Further education colleges can vary considerably in size, and in the subjects and facilities they offer. Many are ‚Äògeneral‚Äô FE colleges and offer courses in a wide range of subject areas. Some further education colleges are specialist colleges, and offer subjects such as agriculture and horticulture, drama and dance. Other specialist colleges cater for students with a particular disability or learning difficulty.  Private training providers  Private training providers can include profit-making or voluntary organisations.  Schools with sixth forms and sixth form colleges  Sixth forms also vary a lot in size, and in the courses and facilities they offer. Sixth form colleges tend to be larger and more informal than school sixth forms and offer both academic style courses (such as A levels) and vocational programmes.  Workplace learning  Workplace learning falls into a number of categories. It can include training for people looking for work, for people learning how to do a job (for example through Apprenticeships or for people learning new skills in their current job (through continuing professional development or employer-facing work initiatives such as Train to Gain). Workplace learning can be offered through different mediums - classroom training, e-learning, or blended learning, a mix of the two.  Offender learning  Offender learning is provides learning activities for offenders in prison or those in the community under the supervision of the Probation Service.  Programmes offered by learning and skills providers  Programmes offered by learning and skills providers are very diverse and range from basic skills basic skills courses to Foundation Degrees, including both academic and vocational qualifications. These programmes are accredited by various awarding bodies, under the supervision of the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority which regulates the qualifications system in England.

During the initial launch and testing phases in late 1997, Planet Poker started to build a customer base, placing advertisements in Card Player magazine. By the time the first real money table opened, a handful of customers were ready to play. On 1 January 1998, after several months of planning and preparation, Planet Poker dealt a $3‚Äì$6 game of Texas hold 'em poker. As days turned to weeks, the small group of customers began to grow and the poker games started to run longer. Sometime in February 1998, a game continued through the night with enough players rotating in and out the game that it carried all the way through to the next evening. It was one of the major milestones in the history of online poker. By the early summer of 1998, Planet Poker had amassed a following, and games regularly ran around the clock. Game selection was increased to meet the demand of the steady stream of new players. For the remainder of 1998, Planet Poker continued to grow, but as with any rapidly growing business, new challenges emerged. Credit card payments were accepted to allow customers an easy means of getting money into and out of the game. However, by far the largest challenges were technical in nature, and problems often required days to fully resolve. The Internet itself was in its infancy and was often plagued by geographic outages and poor connections. Nearly all the players were using dial-up Internet access. Technical problems were further compounded by the growing demand for more features and enhancements. The site lacked many of the necessary playing features, and the backend capability did not adequately manage the cardroom. Planet Poker assembled an in-house team to address the backend issues, but the playing features were more of a challenge. An early Planet Poker lobby Implementation of new playing features required changes to the core game software and Planet had to rely on the third-party supplier to make them. Recognizing the importance of getting these features in place, agreements were renegotiated with the supplier that provided the software provider with generous payments to implement needed changes. However, the software supplier had mixed business interests, and the pace of developing the changes was less than required to keep pace with the evolving online poker industry. Maintaining a relationship with the software supplier soon became a time consuming effort that diverted resources from other aspects of the business. Competition arrives Then in 1999, without advance notice, a new cardroom called Paradise Poker emerged. Coincidentally, in the week that Paradise Poker launched, Planet Poker was plagued with technical problems that led to several days of downtime. By the time Planet Poker recovered, Paradise had established a foothold, and the online poker industry got its first taste of competition. Almost overnight, Paradise Poker attained instant success, and its customer base soon surpassed Planet‚Äôs, despite Planet‚Äôs growth continuing at a record pace. In a few short months, the number of concurrent players at peak times grew from 400 at Planet to 1500 at Planet and Paradise combined, with Paradise emerging as the clear industry leader with superior features and improved stability. Planet staff recognized that it would take time to catch up to Paradise Poker on the technical front. Planet focused on providing the highest level of integrity and security for their customers. Mike Caro was engaged as one of the most respected, recognized names in poker to guide and represent Planet Poker‚Äôs operation. The \\"mad genius of poker\\" provided instant credibility to Planet Poker and the online poker industry as a whole. Roy Cooke also joined the Planet team, as the cardroom manager. By early 2000, the capability gap between Planet Poker and Paradise Poker was continuing to widen. A new company, Acekicker.com Holdings Inc., was formed to develop software for Planet Poker. Based on Planet‚Äôs operational experience, a set of requirements was formulated that would allow Planet to re-capture the number one position in the industry. AceKicker‚Äôs initial efforts were plagued by issues with an offshore software developer, and the development of the software was delayed. By the time the issues were resolved and the development was moved to Canada, there were several new well-funded entrants in the online poker industry, and Planet was chasing a moving target. Most of Planet‚Äôs financial resources were diverted to software development. Planet now lacked the funding and expertise to compete with the industry giants in marketing. Planet would not launch its new system until 2004 and by this time, Party Poker dominated the industry, with a handful of rivals clustered near second place. From 2002 onward, Planet Poker remained a steady fixture as the industry evolved. Many new poker rooms came and went. There was continuing explosive growth in the number of online poker players, but while Planet still retained a loyal customer base, it could never seem to increase its critical mass to a point where it could compete with the larger sites. Planet Poker would peak at around 1200 players, while other cardrooms were setting new daily records that would eventually exceed 100,000. Planet Poker continued on as a small cardroom, with its friendly atmosphere as the primary attraction. Legislation In September 2006, the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) in the U.S. changed the legal landscape for the industry. By the time the act was passed, Planet Poker had registered over three quarters of a million customers. In response to the UIGEA, however, Planet Poker suspended real money operations in March 2007. Planet Poker previously operated as a free play (subscription based) poker site through 2007-2017. Ceasing Operations Planet Poker ceased operations in 2017.

He played as a centre-back and made 70 appearances in the Football League, principally for Lincoln City. League career Dunphy began his career with Barnsley before following manager Allan Clarke to Lincoln City in the summer of 1990. However, disaster struck Dunphy in a pre-season match against Leeds United when he was stretchered off with a serious knee injury. The injury would keep him out of action for almost two years and it was not until April 1992 that Dunphy made his debut for Lincoln. The 1992‚Äì93 season saw Dunphy establish a regular berth at the heart of Lincoln's defence and he would go on to make 31 league appearances that season. The 1993‚Äì94 season saw Lincoln, under the stewardship of new manager Keith Alexander, make a sticky start collecting just four points from the first six league games. Following the 1‚Äì0 home defeat to Mansfield Town on 11 September 1993, Alexander transfer-listed most of his squad and dropped a number of players, including Dunphy, from the team. Dunphy soon linked up with Doncaster Rovers on loan, making a solitary league appearance against Bury on 16 October 1993 before returning to Sincil Bank. He returned to the team towards the end of the season but found himself loaned out to Scarborough at the commencement of the 1994‚Äì95 season. Non-league career In February 1995 he joined the then Football Conference side Kettering Town where he made a single appearance before dropping down to the Northern Premier League and joining Gainsborough Trinity. After just two games he stepped back up to Conference joining Halifax Town where he made his debut in the 0‚Äì0 away draw with Bath City on 27 March 1995. He was substituted at half-time in his next, and final, appearance and returned to Gainsborough Trinity for the remainder of the season. At the beginning of the 1996‚Äì97 season, Dunphy joined Stocksbridge Park Steels and enjoyed the most productive period of his career. He made a total of 139 appearances for the Steels, scoring seven times before moving on to Hallam. In February 2008 he was appointed club coach at hometown club Maltby Main working under the newly appointed manager Robbie Barron. Barron succeeded in keeping Main in the Northern Counties East League Premier Division but resigned at the end of the season due to work commitments and it remains to be seen whether Dunphy followed him.

It is said to have the capacity for around 200 horses, many of which are of extremely high quality. The stable is currently run by Charlie Appleby. Racing silks of Godolphin History of the Moulton Paddocks estate, Suffolk At one time Moulton Paddocks was known as Fidget Hall, a possible reference to Sam Chifney's Fidget Farm of 70 acres situated at the extremity of the Bury Hill gallop. He named the farm after the sire of a horse he had ridden when young. Owners of Moulton Paddocks have since included: Sir Robert Pigot, Lord William Cansfield Gerard, George Alexander Baird, Sir Ernest Cassel and Solly Joel. In 1841 Fidget Hall was 64 acres and owned by George Samuel Ford, known in the racing fraternity as \\"Lawyer Ford\\". He was a financier to gentlemen and noblemen in distress,Death of Mr G S Ford, The Berkshire Chronicle. P. 8, 30 May 1868 and one of the creditors of the bankrupt trainer Will Chifney - brother of Sam.Ex Parte George Samuel Ford in Re William Chifney, a Bankrupt, The Times, p.4, 11 November 1836 Ford was passionately fond of racing: his horse Poison won the 1843 Oaks and Guaracha won the Coronation Stakes in 1846. In 1842 William Webber, surgeon and founder of the Norwich Royal Free Hospital for Incurables, owned Fidget Hall.Heritage Gateway state that Webber owned Fidget Hall in 1838, W M Roberts says 1842 He carried out extensive building work on the property and increased the size of the estate to 313 acres. During this period the name changed from Fidget Hall to Moulton Paddocks. Webber bred race horses and in 1842 the stallion Erymus stood at Moulton Paddocks but died there in January 1847. In 1849 Sir Robert Pigot leased the property from Webber; two of his children were later born there in 1850 and 1852. Mr Willingham Franklin purchased Moulton Paddocks from Webber in 1857, but sold in 1859 (shortly before he died). Franklin, described as ‚Äúbarrister not in practice‚Äù, was the only son of Sir Willingham Franklin (a judge in the supreme court at Madras) and nephew of explorer John Franklin. In 1861 the property was occupied by Captain Astley Paston Cooper, who inherited a baronetcy in 1866 when his father -Sir Astley Paston Cooper, 2nd Baronet - died. From the early 1860s, Moulton Paddocks belonged to the Fryer family. They more than doubled the area of land and improved the house before selling to Lord Gerard in 1885. In 1889 Gerard leased the great horse Ormonde from the Duke of Westminster to stand at Moulton Paddocks. However, the horse was ill and the fertility of the animal so poor that only one foal resulted. Gerard sold Moulton Paddocks to George Alexander Baird in 1892 who moved his stud from Kentford. It was thought that he would also move his Bedford Lodge operation to Moulton Paddocks, but he died the following year. Lillie Langtry the actress was in a relationship with Baird at this time and she would have stayed at Moulton Paddocks. Langtry had a small number of horses in training at Baird's stable and after his death moved them to Kentford - about 3 miles from Moulton Paddocks. She gradually became more interested in racing, purchased additional horses, and in 1895 bought a house in Kentford called Regal Lodge. Baird's executors let Moulton Paddocks on short leases until they found a buyer, and in 1899 Ernest Cassel took ownership. Cassel had become financial adviser to the Prince of Wales in 1897 and the two developed a close friendship. In 1892, the Prince had been persuaded by his racing manager to move his horses from John Porter‚Äôs stables at Kingsclere to those of Richard Marsh at Newmarket. This new arrangement was convenient for the royal residence of Sandringham House and when Cassel purchased Moulton Paddocks the Prince (and later when he was Edward VII) became a frequent visitor.Magnus, Phillip. King Edward the Seventh. John Murray: 1964 By the time of Cassel's death in 1921, the Moulton Paddocks estate had been expanded to 1300 acres. Solly Joel became the owner in 1922 after the death of Cassel. He and his brother Jack Joel had a long running rivalry on the turf as owners, with Jack having the greater success over the years. When Solly purchased Moulton Paddocks, he already had a well established stud at Maiden Erlegh near Reading, Berkshire. He used the stables at Moulton Paddocks to train under Walter Earl. When Joel died in 1931 the estate passed to his son Dudley. After his death in 1941 the house fell into dis-repair and by 1950 had been demolished.

Located adjacent to the campus of Saint Mary's University of Minnesota, IHM Seminary has provided college-level seminary training since 1948. Seminarians from various dioceses across the United States live at IHM Seminary and take classes from Saint Mary's University of Minnesota.http://www.smumn.edu/sitepages/pid570.php While the current bishop of the Diocese of Winona, the Most Reverend John M. Quinn, is the true head of the seminary and Chairman of the Board, the rector of the seminary oversees the day-to-day activities at the seminary. History The early years In 1912, Bishop Patrick Richard Heffron of the Diocese of Winona, founded Saint Mary's College (now Saint Mary's University) on the terraced heights of Winona's Gilmore valley. Bishop Heffron founded the all- male college just two years after being ordained the second bishop of the Winona Diocese. Saint Mary's was founded for the higher education of all young men, but especially for the formation and education of future priests. By 1933, Saint Mary's College was transferred from the Diocese of Winona to the Brothers of the Christian Schools (De La Salle Christian Brothers). This transfer, however, was not completed for ten years due to the fact that the Holy See viewed Saint Mary's as an approved seminary. The transfer was begun was Bishop Francis Martin Kelly and completed by Coadjutor Bishop Leo Binz. By 1947, five years after the completed transfer of Saint Mary's to the Christian Brothers, Bishop Binz requested advice from Archbishop Amleto Cicognani, the Apostolic Delegate at the time, about beginning a diocesan seminary in Winona where seminarians would live at Saint Mary's and take classes therein. By the fall of 1947, a core group of students became the first seminary students at Saint Mary's and were taught by Fathers George Henry Speltz and William Magee, both priests of the Diocese of Winona. The founding years Just a year after Bishop Binz's request for advice from Archbishop Cicognani, Immaculate Heart of Mary (IHM) Seminary was founded and canonically erected on July 16, 1948. Father George Speltz, one of the priest-faculty members of Saint Mary's College, was named the first rector. During its founding year, IHM had an enrollment of twenty-five students. The following year, 1949, the first seminarian, Paul Halloran, graduated from IHM Seminary. In 1950, Bishop Edward Aloysius Fitzgerald became the fourth bishop of Winona and completed the architectural plans for a new seminary dormitory. The Christian Brothers deeded a plot of land from Saint Mary's College to the Diocese of Winona for the construction of the seminary building. Ground was broken by Bishop Fitzgerald on May 1, 1950 and the cornerstone was laid by Archbishop Binz, then the coadjutor of Dubuque. In the spring of 1951, just four years after the request of advice from Archbishop Cicognani, the first students moved into the new seminary building, Kelly Hall, named in honor of Bishop Francis Kelly, the third bishop of Winona and the bishop who began the process of transferring Saint Mary's College to the Christian Brothers. The altar in the Saint John Vianney Chapel of Kelly Hall was dedicated on April 22, 1951 by Bishop Fitzgerald and on March 2, 1952, the first Solemn Mass was celebrated by Father Speltz in the chapel. The continuing years Shortly after the completion of Kelly Hall, construction on Mary Hall (nowadays referred to as the Convent or Guesthouse) was undertaken. May Hall was completed in 1954 and became the home for the first Dominican Sisters who undertook domestic duties at the seminary. Ten years after the completion of Kelly Hall, Saint Leo the Great Hall was completed in 1961. It was blessed by the Apostolic Delegate, Archbishop Egidio Vagnozzi, on March 25, 1962. Archbishop Leo Binz, in whose honor the building was named, was present during the blessing ceremony. By 1974, the Fitzgerald Retreat Center would be housed in Leo Hall. The Retreat Center, named in honor of Bishop Fitzgerald, would be the home of diocesan priest retreats. In 1963, Father Speltz was named Auxiliary Bishop of Winona and Bishop Fitzgerald named Monsignor Joseph McGinnis as the second rector of IHM Seminary. Shortly thereafter, during the 1966‚Äì1967 academic year, the highest total enrollment was reached at ninety seminarians studying at IHM Seminary. The third rector, Monsignor Roy Literski, was appointed by Bishop Fitzgerald in 1968. 1970 brought some changes to IHM Seminary. Post-conciliar reform lead to the remodeling of the Saint John Vianney Chapel. Bishop Loras Watters, fifth bishop of Winona, named Father Robert Brom as rector. Other changes occurred with the religious sisters as the Dominicans returned to Switzerland and the School Sisters of Notre Dame took over domestic duties. The post‚Äìsilver anniversary years 1973 brought the twenty-fifth anniversary of IHM Seminary; an alumni gathering was held in June of that year. During 1986‚Äì1987, IHM Seminary was studied under the Papal Seminary Study and the chapel was renovated again in 1986. In June 1988, a fortieth anniversary alumni reunion was held at IHM. Just a year later, in 1989, the IHM Seminary Endowment fund was created. Beginning in 1994, IHM Seminary and the priest faculty and staff began all sacramental ministry at Saint Mary's College, which was renamed a University in 1995. The second Papal Seminary Study was undertaken in the fall of 2005 and minor renovations of Kelly Hall were completed throughout 2002‚Äì2008. In August 2006, ground was broken on the Pope John Paul II Memorial Garden, located in front of Kelly Hall. The garden, completed by the summer of 2007 and is formed in the shape of the Celtic cross that is located atop of the bell tower of IHM Seminary. Located within the garden are the Stations of the Cross by American artist Lynn Kircher, a fountain, and an outdoor grotto with altar for outdoor Masses. Campus buildings *Kelly Hall is the original seminary building, built during 1950‚Äì1951. The construction contracts were awarded on April 25, 1950 and Bishop Edward Fitzgerald broke ground for the building on May 1, 1950. The cornerstone of Kelly Hall was laid by Archbishop Leo Binz on June 15, 1950 with all priests of the diocese present. Students moved into the building on March 3, 1951. Kelly Hall houses the main student residence, guest suites, seminary offices, the Saint John Vianney Chapel, lounges, the Loras Library, kitchen/pantry, refectory, assembly room, as well as garages, maintenance office, and boiler equipment. *Leo Hall (officially Saint Leo the Great Hall) was built adjacent to Kelly Hall in 1961 and named after IHM's founder, Bishop Leo Binz. It was blessed by the Apostolic Delegate, Archbishop Egidio Vagnozzi, in 1962. Archbishop Binz was present for the ceremony. Today, Leo Hall houses the secondary student residence, guest rooms, the rector's suite, as well as the Sedes Sapienti√¶ Chapel, named in honor of Mary under the title of Our Lady Seat of Wisdom. Also located in Leo Hall is the Leo Conference Room, student recreation room, television room, laundry facilities, housekeeping office, garages, and boiler equipment. *Mary Hall (commonly referred to as the Convent or Guesthouse) was built during 1953‚Äì1954. Built as a residence for the first Dominican sisters to work at IHM Seminary, the residence was also used by the School Sisters of Notre Dame who worked at IHM Seminary after the Dominican sisters left IHM in 1970 to return to Switzerland. As there are currently no religious sisters at IHM Seminary, the building is now used as a guesthouse for visiting prelates, priests, or families. *Belltower. The IHM Seminary belltower is directly behind Kelly Hall and faces both the seminary campus and the campus of Saint Mary's University of Minnesota. The belltower rings daily for the Angelus. The bell is also rung on the occasion of the death or election of a new pope. Chapels * Saint John Vianney Chapel. The Saint John Vianney Chapel (SJV Chapel), named after the Cur√© d'Ars, Saint John Vianney, is the main chapel of Immaculate Heart of Mary Seminary. Located in the center of Kelly Hall, the SJV Chapel is the heart of the seminary and the site of daily liturgical functions. The Blessed Sacrament is reserved in the SJV Chapel and there is daily mass and adoration of the Blessed Sacrament. As the SJV Chapel is the main chapel for the seminary, morning and evening prayer is prayed in common in the chapel. The stained-glass windows of the chapel depict various saints as well as the gifts of the Holy Spirit. The stained-glass windows in the sanctuary depict the archangels Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael. *Sedes Sapienti√¶ Chapel. The Sedes Sapienti√¶ Chapel, located in Leo Hall, is a smaller devotional chapel of Immaculate Heart of Mary Seminary used for devotions and private prayer. The Blessed Sacrament is reserved in this chapel. It is named in honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary under the title of Our Lady, Seat of Wisdom. Seminarians often meet in small groups to pray various devotions (such as the Rosary) or the Liturgy of the Hours in this chapel. Masses with a smaller congregations are held in this chapel on occasion. The stained-glass windows depict Mary, Sedes Sapienti√¶, and the seven sacraments. *Mary Hall Chapel. There was, at one time, a chapel in Mary Hall (the Convent or Guesthouse) for use by the sisters when Mary Hall was the home of the religious sisters. This chapel was removed when the religious sisters left Immaculate Heart of Mary Seminary. *Corpus Christi Chapel. There was, at one time, a second chapel in Kelly Hall used for private prayer and adoration of the Blessed Sacrament. After the construction of the Sedes Sapienti√¶ Chapel in Leo Hall, the Corpus Christi Chapel was renovated and turned into an office for spiritual directors and the office for the Director of Music. Pope John Paul II Memorial Garden Located in the front lawn of Immaculate Heart of Mary Seminary, the Pope John II Memorial Garden is a multi-acre garden which offers a serene and reflective area for seminarians and the general public. After Pope John Paul II's death in 2005, the rector at that time, was inspired to design a garden to honor the late pontiff. As the Stations of the Cross were one of the pontiff's favorite devotions, it was decided that the garden would center around the Stations of the Cross. Ground was broken for the garden in August 2006 and three months later the Stations themselves were installed. A year after groundbreaking, in August 2007, the centerpiece of the garden, the sculpture of the burial shroud of Christ was installed. Purpose The purpose of the Pope John II Memorial Garden is simply to provide additional prayer and reflection areas for seminarians discerning a call to the priesthood and for the general public for devotional use. The Stations of the Cross can be prayed at one's leisure, taking time for prayer and meditation. Also, because of the outdoor grotto and altar, the Holy Mass can be celebrated outside on occasion. Stations of the Cross Throughout the main part of the Pope John II Memorial Garden, the Stations of the Cross form the outline of a Celtic cross, the same cross that is located on the top of the seminary bell tower. In addition to the traditional fourteen stations, two extra stations were added off the main path. These two extra stations are (1) Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane and (2) the Resurrection of Jesus. The Stations were designed by American artist Lynn Kircher. Grotto and altar Set in local limestone, the outdoor grotto and altar provides a special area for outdoor gatherings and space for the Holy Mass. The area is dedicated to the Blessed Mother, with statues of Our Lady and Our Lady of Guadalupe, and provides space for votive candles and private prayer. Shroud of Christ Located in the center of the garden is the empty tomb of Christ, with a life-sized solid bronze burial shroud, designed by Lynn Kircher. Located throughout the center of the garden, cast bronze birds perch on the outdoor works of art. \\"New Life\\" water feature Located next to the empty tomb, a , solid limestone boulder sits in which water springs forth water representing the water of life and the redemptive gifts of the Lord. As the waters flows naturally down the boulder, the sounds of trickling water can be heard throughout the garden. The boulder also reminds visitors of the water God provided for the ancient Israelites brought forth from the rock by Moses. About the artist Lynn Kircher is a full- time artist living in Jaroso, Colorado. An art teacher for nearly twenty years, Kircher pioneered programs and processes which live on through his students. In 1997, he turned his passion for sculpture and became a full-time artist. His art has been accepted into the Vatican Collection and he was interviewed by Pope John Paul II in 2002. Seminary library As all students at Immaculate Heart of Mary Seminary are full students at Saint Mary's University of Minnesota, all students are welcome to use the Fitzgerald Library (named in honor of Bishop Edward Fitzgerald, fourth bishop of Winona) which has a collection of over 400,000 books, including many philosophical, theological, and canon law titles. At IHM Seminary, the Loras Library is open to all seminarians. The Loras Library is named in honor of the late Bishop Loras J. Watters, fifth bishop of Winona. The Loras Library, located on the first floor of Kelly Hall, houses a small collection of books, mainly philosophical and theological titles as well as a number of books on spirituality, scripture, and hagiography. Program of study The majority of students who study at Immaculate Heart of Mary Seminary do not come to IHM in possession of a bachelor's degree. Because of this fact, students study at IHM and Saint Mary's University to earn a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree. The majority of these students major in a specially-designed philosophy major. Other courses in theology and Latin are also required. Students are free to double major or minor in fields of their choice so long as all the philosophical requirements are met. These students usually remain at IHM for four years, or until graduation and philosophy requirements are met (for transfer students). Students who already possess a bachelor's degree (e.g., BA or BSc) are considered \\"pre-theology\\" students. Pre-Theology students are able to receive a B. Phil. in Philosophy from St. Mary's University upon completion of the requirements of Philosophy under the Program of Priestly Formation. Mission statement Flowing from its responsibility to build God's Kingdom on Earth, Immaculate Heart of Mary Seminary (IHMS) nurtures and heartens a man's calling from God to the ministerial priesthood. IHMS strengthens and deepens the seminarian's personal commitment to Jesus Christ with the highest quality programs of spiritual, intellectual, pastoral, and human formation. While supporting and encouraging the development of each man's natural gifts, IHMS strives to help the men discern and answer God's call with hearts on fire! Vision statement Always focused on the mission of God's Church, Immaculate Heart of Mary Seminary is a beacon of Christ Himself, inviting men to follow His call, preparing a new generation of priests for leadership and service. Seminary motto The official motto of Immaculate Heart of Mary Seminary is the Latin text of Psalm 133:1: Ecce quam bonum et quam iucundum habitare fratres, fratres in unum (Behold how good and how splendid where brothers dwell as one.) The Latin motto is often shortened to simply Ecce Quam Bonum (Behold How Good) as seen on the seminary crest, which was designed by the ninth rector of IHM Seminary, Father James Steffes. The English translation of Psalm 133:1 is not used for the motto. Apostolic visitations Immaculate Heart of Mary Seminary was visited by Vatican- appointed representatives during the Papal Seminary Study in February 1986 under the chairmanship of Bishop William H. Keeler of Harrisburg. The next apostolic visitation occurred in November 2005 when all U.S. seminaries and houses of formation were visited by Vatican-appointed representatives.

It is situated near the village of Croesyceiliog, about 2 km south of Carmarthen. Myrddin, the Welsh name of the legendary figure Merlin, is traditionally associated with the town of Carmarthen (Caerfyrddin: Myrddin's fort), and Bro Myrddin means \\"Myrddin's country (or vale)\\". Approximately 79% of pupils come from Welsh-speaking homes, but all pupils speak Welsh to first-language standard. History The School was founded in 1978, on the premises of the former Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School for Boys, Carmarthen. In 1996 the school was moved to its current purpose built campus at Croesyceiliog. Its first Pennaeth (Headteacher) was Mr Gareth Evans, who was succeeded upon his retirement in 1997 by Mr Eric Jones, and then by Mr Dorian Williams, in 2006. The latest Headteacher is Dr Llinos Jones, who took Mr Williams' place at his retirement in 2014.  Category change  On September 2016 the school was changed to a Category CC school, which means that it is a designated Welsh school. Bro Myrddin was first in the county to become a MW school. Furthermore, all National Curriculum subjects are taught in Welsh (except for English), from year 7 in 2016 and for every subsequent year.http://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/9941ea_11a4f9067c1548e697911c28cfbfdf01.pdf There were many consultations and discussions with Parents future, past and present, pupils past and present, members of staff and the local community. And there were some concerns raised, the main concern was studying in Universities where the Mathematics and Science training is through the medium of English after following a Welsh course at the school, some thought that this would be a disadvantage. On the other hand, there were numerous benefits of this change including that it will encourage the Welsh ethos outside the classroom. And reduce the workload of the teachers who currently have to produce bilingual resources.https://www.carmarthenshire.gov.wales/media/4180/consultation- report-ysgol-gyfun-gymraeg-bro-myrddin-english-v2.pdf Ethos The school's motto is 'Heb Ddysg Heb Ddeall', which translates as 'Without learning there is no understanding'. The school colours are lilac and black. Houses The school has four houses (which are referred to using the Welsh 'Llys'): Hengwrt (house colour: green), Hergest (red), Llwydiarth (black) and Peniarth (blue). The four houses annually compete in the school's own version of the Eisteddfod, in which there is a day of singing, playing instruments, reciting and numerous other events ‚Äì held on the nearest Friday to St David‚Äôs day, and a sports day held in the summer term, also numerous events are held during the year. Musical Approximately every 3 years a musical is performed in the local theatre. The 2016 musical was called 'Chwarae Cuddio' ('Hide and Seek' in Welsh). The 2019 musical 'Rhif 1 Heol Penlan' was staged at the Lyric Theatre between the 20th to the 22nd of November. This original musical was about the lively history of the Carmarthen Union Workhouse in 1837.

Their sound has developed and matured over the years from jangly roots rock to a hard cutting Alt-Country sound. They were formed in 1996 while living in Manhattan, Kansas and played extensively in the Midwest as an independent band. The band toured extensively nationwide, playing with many of the top acts in Christian music. They shared billing with artists such as the Newsboys, Audio Adrenaline, Skillet, Smalltown Poets, Chris Tomlin, Steven Curtis Chapman, and others. They toured extensively with Big Tent Revival, Jennifer Knapp, Eli, Clear, Jason Ingram Band, Mitch McVicker, and others. In 1997 they signed with Ardent Forefront Records and made their National debut with their self-titled first release. The band's first single, \\"Say I Am,\\" was top three on the CHR charts and began a string of top ten radio hits that lasted for several years. Follow up hit \\"Fool,\\" broke the top ten later that year and the music video \\"Either Way\\" was number one for several weeks on the Video Charts (ZooTV). \\"Wash\\" was another top ten favorite and also charted on Rock Radio. \\"Equal To the Fall\\" was the band's only Adult Contemporary hit. The follow-up record, \\"Great Big Universe,\\" had similar radio success. The record's highest charting single was \\"Revive Me,\\" which topped out at number 5. Other top ten hits were \\"Great Big Universe\\" and \\"Broken Again.\\" The record was critically acclaimed but never achieved the sales that Ardent Forefront had hoped for. The third record was a live worship album recorded at New Earth Coffeehouse in Kansas City. After a long hiatus the band reformed to record a full on alt-country record entitled \\"Straight Back to Kansas.\\" Available only online through CDBaby and digital download, the record had modest indie success. Then their fifth album was released independently in 2006. As of mid-2009, the band was putting the finishing touches on another worship album, this time a solo project for front-man Tim Suttle, but all of the same players from the band did the record.

Most activity was from November through February. According to the M√©t√©o-France office (MFR) at R√©union, there were 21 tropical disturbances, 14 of which intensified into tropical depressions. There were 12 named storms, beginning with Antoinette and proceeding sequentially until Lisette. In addition, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center also warned on storms in the region, which identified five other tropical storms. Five of the storms attained tropical cyclone status, or with 10-minute maximum sustained winds of at least 120 km/h (75 mph); of these, three strengthened further into intense tropical cyclones, with Daniella and Helinda tied for strongest storm of the season. In August, a tropical depression developed in the south-west Indian Ocean for the first time 27 years, and a month later, a rare September tropical disturbance formed. The first named storm, Antoinette, was the first of several to originate in the neighboring Australian basin, or east of 90¬∞ E; the subsequent two named storms also formed in the Australian region. In early December, Cyclone Daniella likely developed out of the remnants of previous Tropical Storm Chantelle. After reaching peak 10-minute winds of 185 km/h (115 mph), Daniella weakened and passed just southwest of Mauritius; there, the storm left heavy crop damage and indirectly caused three deaths. In early January, Tropical Storm Fabriola was the first in a succession of three storms to move over Madagascar. The next - Cyclone Gretelle - killed 152 people when it struck southeastern Madagascar. Between January and February, Cyclone Pancho-Helinda lasted about 20 days between both the Australian and south-west Indian basins. Also in February, Tropical Storm Josie killed 36 people in western Madagascar after causing severe flooding. The final named storm was Tropical Storm Lisette, which dissipated on March 3 after striking Mozambique, killing three people. Despite the early end to the named storms, there were two additional disturbances, one of which became the first July tropical depression in 25 years. __TOC__ Season summary ImageSize = width:800 height:200 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20 Legend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/08/1996 till:01/08/1997 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/08/1996 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:DT value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Tropical_Disturbance_<_50_km/h_(_<_31_mph) id:TD value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Tropical_Depression_=_51-62_km/h_(32-38_mph) id:MS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Moderate_tropical_Storm_=_63-88_km/h_(39-54_mph) id:SS value:rgb(0.80,1,1) legend:Severe_Tropical_Storm_=_89-117_km/h_(55-73_mph) id:TC value:rgb(1,1,0.80) legend:Tropical_Cyclone_=_118-165_km/h_(74-102_mph) id:IT value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25) legend:Intense_=_166-212_km/h_(103-132_mph) id:VI value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38) legend:Very_Intense_>_212_km/h_(_>_132_mph) Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:Month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:16/08/1996 till:19/08/1996 color:TD text:A1 (TDe) from:17/10/1996 till:21/10/1996 color:SS text:Antoinette (STS) from:01/11/1996 till:11/11/1996 color:IT text:Melanie-Bellamine (ITC) from:24/11/1996 till:30/11/1996 color:SS text:Chantelle (STS) from:02/12/1996 till:10/12/1996 color:IT text:Daniella (ITC) from:09/12/1996 till:16/12/1996 color:MS text:Elvina (MTS) barset:break from:02/01/1997 till:09/01/1997 color:SS text:Fabriola (STS) from:05/01/1997 till:12/01/1997 color:DT text:Phil (TDi) from:12/01/1997 till:13/01/1997 color:DT text:13S (TDi) from:19/01/1997 till:31/01/1997 color:TC text:Gretelle (TC) from:23/01/1997 till:23/01/1997 color:IT text: barset:break barset:skip barset:skip barset:skip barset:skip from:31/01/1997 till:07/02/1997 color:IT text:Pancho-Helinda (ITC) from:24/01/1997 till:30/01/1997 color:SS text:Iletta (STS) barset:break from:05/02/1997 till:16/02/1997 color:TC text:Josie (TC) from:14/02/1997 till:25/02/1997 color:SS text:Karlette (STS) from:24/02/1997 till:03/03/1997 color:SS text:Lisette (STS) from:20/07/1997 till:25/07/1997 color:TD text:M2 (TDe) bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/08/1996 till:01/09/1996 text:August from:01/09/1996 till:01/10/1996 text:September from:01/10/1996 till:01/11/1996 text:October from:01/11/1996 till:01/12/1996 text:November from:01/12/1996 till:01/01/1997 text:December from:01/01/1997 till:01/02/1997 text:January from:01/02/1997 till:01/03/1997 text:February from:01/03/1997 till:01/04/1997 text:March from:01/04/1997 till:01/05/1997 text:April from:01/05/1997 till:01/06/1997 text:May from:01/06/1997 till:01/07/1997 text:June from:01/07/1997 till:01/08/1997 text:July During the season, the M√©t√©o-France office (MFR) based on R√©union island issued warnings in tropical cyclones within the basin, as part of its role as a Regional Specialized Meteorological Center. The agency estimated intensities via the Dvorak technique, which uses images from two satellites by the American National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. On certain days, the satellites had limited coverage in the eastern portion of the region, which limited warning capability. At the time, the MFR issued warnings on tropical cyclones in the Indian Ocean from the coast of Africa to 90¬∞ E, south of the equator. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center - a joint United States Navy ‚Äì United States Air Force task force - also issued tropical cyclone warnings for the region. Wind estimates from M√©t√©o-France and most other basins throughout the world are sustained over 10 minutes, while estimates from the United States-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center are sustained over 1 minute. 10 minute winds are about 1.14 times the amount of 1 minute winds. The MFR named storms from a sequential list provided by the nation of Seychelles, beginning with Antoinette. In addition to the named storms in the year, the list included Maryse, Nelda, Ocline, Phyllis, Rolina, Sheryl, Thelma, Venyda, Wiltina, and Yolette. The season was active, about 50% above normal, and was the fourth consecutive above-normal season. There was a total of 100 days on which disturbances, depressions, storms, or cyclones were active, compared to the average of 68. There were 12 named storms, above the normal of 9. Five intensified into tropical cyclones, also above the normal of 4. The season was the longest on record, with the first depression in August 1996 and the final depression in July 1997. Despite the long season, there was minimal activity from March to May, which usually represents about 25% of total activity. In addition, February was relatively quiet despite being the climatological peak. Majority of the storms developed in the northeast portion of the basin, and the storms took a variety of tracks during their durations. Systems Severe Tropical Storm Antoinette In the middle of October, the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) was active over the northeast portion of the basin and into the adjacent Australian region, spawning a low pressure area on October 15 northwest of the Cocos Islands. With a large ridge to the south, the system tracked southwestward, crossing into the south-west Indian Ocean as a tropical depression on October 17. Also on that day, the JTWC began issuing warnings on the system as Tropical Cyclone 4S. On October 18, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Antoinette after developing a well-defined central dense overcast, and began turning more to the west-southwest. That day, Antoinette strengthened to a peak intensity of just below tropical cyclone status, or with 10-minute winds just below 120 km/h (75 mph). Around that time, the storm developed an eye feature, but that quickly dissipated. Antoinette began weakening steadily on October 20 due to increasing wind shear, and by that time it was moving quickly westward. After the circulation became largely devoid of deep convection, the storm weakened into a tropical depression on October 21\\\\. The next day, Antoinette passed about north of the northern tip of Madagascar, and dissipated on October 24 in the Mozambique Channel. Intense Tropical Cyclone Melanie-Bellamine In late October, the ITCZ developed a persistent area of convection west of the Indonesian island of Sumatra. A tropical low formed on October 28 within the Australian region, which initially failed to develop much due to persistent wind shear. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) named the system Melanie on October 31 to the north of the Cocos Islands. The newly upgraded storm tracked generally westward due to a ridge to the south, and entered the south-west Indian Ocean on November 1 as a strong tropical storm. At that time, Melanie was renamed Bellamine. After the ridged moved farther away, the storm turned more to the southwest and began quickly intensifying. Early on November 3, Bellamine attained tropical cyclone status, and the next day reached peak 10-minute winds of 175 km/h (110 mph); this made it an intense tropical cyclone. After reaching peak winds, Bellamine slowed its motion on November 4 while moving between two high pressure areas, and weakened slightly. After another ridge built, the cyclone resumed a steady west-southwest track, although its 10-minute winds decreased to 140 km/h (85 mph) by November 6\\\\. That day, Bellamine began restrengthening as the eye became increasingly well-defined, in diameter. On November 7, the storm re- attained intense tropical cyclone status, as well as its previous peak intensity according to MFR. This was a rare occurrence of an early November storm becoming an intense tropical cyclone on two occasions. Meanwhile, the JTWC estimated peak 1-minute winds of 230 km/h (145 mph). A strong approaching trough turned Bellamine to the southeast on November 8 and incurred rapid weakening due to wind shear. After the trough passed the cyclone, Bellamine turned back to the southwest on November 10 as a weakening tropical depression. Two days later, the circulation dissipated without having affected land. Severe Tropical Storm Chantelle Similar to previous storms Antoinette and Bellamine, Tropical Storm Chantelle originated from the ITCZ in the Australian region. On November 23, the MFR began tracking the system as a tropical disturbance off the west coast of Sumatra. The system fluctuated in intensity while moving westward, entering the south-west Indian as a tropical depression on November 24. Around that time, the JTWC had begun classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 7S. On November 26, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Chantelle, and the convection continued to organize despite the presence of wind shear. That day, the JTWC estimated peak 1-minute winds of 120 km/h (75 mph). On November 27, the MFR estimated peak 10-minute winds of 95 km/h (60 mph). An approaching trough imparted significant weakening, and Chantelle weakened to tropical depression status 18 hours after it was at peak intensity. A ridge behind the trough steered the weakening system to the northwest, causing Chantelle to reach the low latitude of 5¬∞ S. Widespread cloudiness made it difficult for MFR to continue tracking the circulation, and the agency issued the final advisory on November 30 northwest of Diego Garcia. The JTWC continued tracking the storm for several more days, and the remnants of Chantelle likely contributed to the formation of the subsequent Tropical Cyclone Daniella. Intense Tropical Cyclone Daniella After the previous Tropical Storm Chantelle lost its circulation near Diego Garcia on November 30, residual convection persisted and moved to the southwest due to a large ridge. A new tropical disturbance developed on December 2 after wind shear diminished. Because the remnants took longer than 48 hours to redevelop, the MFR policy at the time was to treat the disturbance as a new system. On December 3, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Daniella, and an eye began to form the next day, indicative of further strengthening. The MFR upgraded Daniella to tropical cyclone status on December 5\\\\. At 1800 UTC that day, both the MFR and JTWC estimated peak winds; the former agency estimated 10-minute winds of 185 km/h (115 mph), making Daniella an intense tropical cyclone, and the JTWC estimated 1-minute winds of 220 km/h (140 mph). Around that time, the cyclone turned to the south due to an approaching trough. The eye, previously well-defined and in diameter at its peak, gradually became less organized due to decreasing water temperatures. Daniella turned more to the southeast on December 8, bringing it between the islands of R√©union and Mauritius after weakening into a strong tropical storm. A sharp increase in wind shear removed the convection from the circulation on December 9, weakening Daniella to tropical depression status. Two days later, the circulation dissipated. Late in its duration, Daniella passed within of Mauritius, producing wind gusts of and about of rainfall. Port Louis recorded a storm surge of during the passage. About half of the island lost power and many lost water service. Daniella also left heavy crop damage, due to the heavy rainfall. All flights were canceled during the storm's passage. Three were three indirect deaths on Mauritius, including one from a road accident and another due to electrocution. After threatening to directly strike R√©union, the cyclone passed about northeast of the island. As a result, winds were not as strong as on Mauritius. Moderate Tropical Storm Elvina In early December, the ITCZ spawned an area of convection near the boundary between the south-west Indian and Australian regions. On December 8, the MFR estimated that a disturbance formed just within the Australian region, which entered this basin on December 9\\\\. After the convection developed into a central dense overcast, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Elvina on December 10\\\\. Later that day, the MFR estimated peak 10-minute winds of 85 km/h (50 mph). On December 11, the JTWC estimated peak 1-minute winds of 100 km/h (65 mph). By that time, Elvina had been moving steadily west- southwestward, although the storm slowed on December 12\\\\. A polar trough caused the storm to accelerate to the southwest on December 14 while simultaneously increasing wind shear, causing weakening. On December 16, Elvina dissipated well to the south of Diego Garcia. Severe Tropical Storm Fabriola Toward the end of December, the ITCZ produced a widespread area of convection to the northeast of Madagascar. A circulation developed on January 2 about of Tromelin Island, becoming a tropical disturbance. After the convection organized more, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Fabriola on January 3. Moving southwestward, the storm strengthened somewhat, reaching 10-minute winds of 85 km/h (50 mph) before making landfall on the Masoala Peninsula in eastern Madagascar. Around that time, the JTWC estimated peak 1-minute winds of 1-winds of 110 km/h (70 mph). Fabriola quickly weakened into a tropical depression over land and emerged into the Mozambique Channel on January 5\\\\. Due to proximity to land, the system failed to re-intensify initially despite warm waters. On January 6, while turning to the south around western Madagascar, Fabriola again attained tropical storm status. The next day, the MFR estimated peak 10-minute winds of 100 km/h (65 mph), and after turning to the southeast, Fabriola struck southwestern Madagascar near Morombe late on January 7\\\\. The storm again quickly weakened over land, emerging back into the Indian Ocean on January 8 as a tropical disturbance. After turning more to the south, Fabriola dissipated on January 10 when it was absorbed by a nearby trough. Fabriola spread rainfall across Madagascar, which proved beneficial for crops. Tropical Cyclone Gretelle The ITCZ spawned a tropical disturbance on January 19 just west of St. Brandon, and within a day intensified into Tropical Storm Gretelle. With a large ridge to the southeast, the storm moved southwestward and gradually intensified, becoming a tropical cyclone on January 22\\\\. Around that time, the storm passed about northwest of R√©union. Early on January 23, the MFR estimated peak 10-minute winds of 140 km/h (85 mph), while JTWC estimated 1-minute winds of 215 km/h (130 mph) the next day. While near peak intensity, Gretelle made landfall on southeastern Madagascar near Farafangana, the first cyclone to hit the region in 41 years. Gretelle rapidly weakened into a tropical depression over land, but gradually re-intensified into a moderate tropical storm in the Mozambique Channel. A trough turned the storm to the southeast on January 28, and three days later the storm dissipated south-southwest of Madagascar. In R√©union, Gretelle dropped nearly of rainfall in the mountainous center of the island. The cyclone produced wind gusts of over at Farafangana, Madagascar, along with heavy rainfall that washed away the local meteorological station. Flooding up to was reported in some areas, which washed away several boats and forced residents to hold onto trees to survive. Many houses were damaged or destroyed, leaving 80,000 people homeless. The World Food Programme estimated that Gretelle destroyed 7,000 tons of rice, 123,500 tons of cassava, and 8,000 tons of cash crops, mostly to coffee. Overall, about 200 people were killed or left missing in Madagascar, with 152 confirmed fatalities by two weeks after the storm, and damage was estimated at $50 million (1997 USD). Later, the storm caused power outages and knocked over trees in southeastern Mozambique. Intense Tropical Cyclone Pancho-Helinda The long-lived Cyclone Pancho- Helinda formed on January 18 in the Australian region from the monsoon trough to the north of the Cocos Islands. For several days, the system meandered in several directions before maintaining a southwest trajectory on January 21\\\\. Around that time, the system had intensified into Tropical Cyclone Pancho, reaching 10-minute winds of 205 km/h (125 mph) before weakening occurred. On January 23, the cyclone entered the south-west Indian Ocean, at which time Pancho was renamed Helinda. Around that time, the storm was located between two ridges, causing the motion to become nearly stationary, and by January 24 Helinda had re-entered the Australian region. Around that time, the storm began undergoing a large loop to the east of 90¬∞ E, during which the winds decreased below tropical storm status. The influence of the monsoon trough turned the storm back to the south on January 29, and a day later a building ridge turned the storm back to the west. On January 31, Helinda again crossed into the south-west Indian Ocean as an intensifying tropical storm. With warm waters and favorable upper-level conditions, Helinda attained cyclone status on February 1, and the MFR estimated peak 10-minute winds of 185 km/h (115 mph). Around the same time, the JTWC estimated peak 1-minute winds of 215 km/h (130 mph), slightly below its estimate for the cyclone's peak winds in the Australian region. Due to a powerful ridge near √éle Amsterdam, Helinda turned to the southeast on February 2, where cooler water temperatures induced weakening. Two days later, strong wind shear contributed to further weakening, and the storm deteriorated to tropical depression status. Turning back to the west, the circulation was declared dissipated by the MFR on February 7, although the JTWC continued tracking Helinda until February 14 when the system was off the northeast coast of Madagascar. Severe Tropical Storm Iletta On January 23, the ITCZ spawned an area of convection to the southwest of Diego Garcia, west of Helinda and east of Gretelle. The system quickly developed an organized central dense overcast, but failed to become a tropical cyclone due to the lack of a circulation in the region. Late on January 24, the system developed into a tropical depression, by which time the Mauritius Meteorological Services had named it Iletta. The depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm, but further development halted on January 25\\\\. Due to a nearby trough, the storm tracked to the southeast. Iletta resumed intensification on January 26, quickly reaching peak 10-winds of 100 km/h (65 mph); the JTWC meanwhile estimated peak 1-minute winds of 140 km/h (85 mph). Subsequently, increased wind shear weakened Iletta, and within 24 hours the storm had decreased from peak intensity to tropical depression status. After the trough passed the storm, Iletta turned to the north under the influence of a ridge to the south, dissipating on January 30 about 305 km (190 mi) east-southeast of where it initially formed. Tropical Cyclone Josie In late January into early February, the ITCZ produced areas of convection around the northern tip of Madagascar. One such convective system spawned a low pressure area between Tromelin island and Agal√©ga, which initially was still located within the ITCZ. On February 5, the system developed into a tropical depression, and failed to intensify further while executing a clockwise loop off northeastern Madagascar. After the convection increased, the depression intensified into a tropical storm on February 8 and was named Josie by the Meteorological Services of Madagascar. Subsequently, the storm moved across northern Madagascar and emerged into the Mozambique Channel on February 9 as a tropical depression, its structure deteriorated. Josie turned to the southwest around western Madagascar, and despite warm waters it initially failed to re-intensify much. On February 11, Josie re- attained tropical storm status, and subsequently turned to the south due to a broad area of low pressure in the region. The storm quickly intensified once moving far enough away from Madagascar, becoming a tropical cyclone on February 13 and soon after reaching peak 10-winds of 140 km/h (85 mph); in contrast, the JTWC estimated peak 1-minute winds of 165 km/h (105 mph). While near peak intensity, the eyewall of Josie passed over Europa Island. An approaching cold front turned the cyclone to the southeast, bringing the storm over cooler waters and causing weakening due to increased wind shear. On February 16, Josie became extratropical well to the south of Madagascar, and dissipated the next day. In northwestern Madagascar, Josie dropped heavy rainfall and caused widespread flooding. Several towns were isolated, forcing residents to travel by boat. The storm heavily damaged crops in the region, particularly to vanilla. The rains caused rivers to exceed their banks, resulting in flooding up to 3.6 m (12 ft) deep. Nationwide, at least 36 people were killed due to Josie, although there were initial reports of 500 people missing. On Europa Island, Josie produced maximum sustained winds of 130 km/h (81 mph), with gusts to , before blowing the anemometer away. Severe Tropical Storm Karlette An area of convection formed in the northeast portion of the basin, developing into a tropical disturbance on February 14\\\\. Despite the presence of easterly wind shear, the system slowly organized into Tropical Storm Karlette on February 16\\\\. By that time, the storm had a large and disorganized area of convection, which quickly weakened due to an increase in wind shear. Early on February 17, Karlette weakened to tropical depression status, although later that day re-attained tropical storm status after the shear diminished. The storm had been moving generally to the west-southwest due to a large ridge to the southeast. The storm's restrengthening was short- lived, as Karlette again weakened to tropical depression status on February 20, only to re-intensify into a tropical storm for the third time just six hours later. With the convection reorganizing, the storm developed an eye feature, indicative of the restrengthening. Late on February 21, Karlette passed about 70 km (45 mi) south of Rodrigues, where wind gusts remained below ; also on the island, the storm dropped beneficial rainfall totaling around . Subsequently, Karlette attained peak 10-minute winds of 110 km/h (70 mph) on February 22, while the JTWC estimated 1-minute winds of 120 km/h (75 km/h). Passing well to the southeast of Mauritius, the storm curved more to the south due to an approaching trough, dissipating on February 25. Severe Tropical Storm Lisette Toward the end of February, the ITCZ spawned a system along the Mozambique coast. With a circulation and warm water temperatures, the system developed into a tropical disturbance on February 24 just offshore northeastern Mozambique. The system slowly organized while drifting southward between two ridges. After an increase in convection, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Lisette on February 28 according to the MFR, although by that time the JTWC had upgraded the storm to the equivalent of tropical cyclone status. A building ridge turned the storm sharply westward. On March 1, the MFR estimated peak 10-minute winds of 95 km/h (60 mph), making Lisette a severe tropical storm with an eye feature in the center. By comparison, the JTWC estimated peak 1-minute winds of 130 km/h (85 mph). The storm failed to intensify further, making landfall at peak intensity just north of Beira, Mozambique early on March 2\\\\. Lisette turned to the west-northwest, dissipating over Zimbabwe on March 3. Lisette dropped heavy rainfall across the region it traversed, causing severe flooding in central and northern Mozambique. Most of the south-central Mozambique was drenched with rainfall totals ranging from to , setting numerous records. Due to the precursor disturbance of Lisette, the Nampula Province in Mozambique was severely flooded by the storm, severely damaging several roads. Along the coast, the storm produced a wave height of about near Beira. Lisette and its resultant flooding destroyed 17,000 houses in Mozambique, affecting 300,000 people. Throughout the country, the cyclone killed 87 people. Other storms In addition to the named storms, the MFR tracked seven tropical disturbances and two tropical depressions throughout the year. Most were short lived, often receiving few warnings. The first two systems developed before Tropical Storm Antoinette in October. For several weeks in early August - the middle of winter in the southern hemisphere - an area of warm water temperatures of over persisted in the northeast portion of the basin. The region was unaffected by the progression of troughs that would usually decrease the water temperatures. On August 13, an area of convection persisted east of the Chagos, in association with the near-equatorial trough, later developing a low pressure area and well-defined circulation. On August 16, the system organized into a tropical disturbance, becoming Tropical Depression A1 the next day; this made it the first such storm in the month of August since Tropical Depression Aline in August 1969. Also on August 17, the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 2S. The depression moved southward, developing a well-defined central dense overcast, despite the presence of northerly wind shear. On August 18, an anticyclone turned the depression eastward; that day, the JTWC estimated peak 1-minute winds of 85 km/h (50 mph), and the MFR estimated a peak 10-minute intensity of 55 km/h (35 mph). The depression later began to weaken under the influence of an approaching trough, and was dissipating as it crossed into the Australian region on August 19. The JTWC tracked the circulation for another two days, estimating that the system turned sharply to the west, and the circulation dissipated on August 23. Less than a month later, another area of convection developed within the near-equatorial trough near the Chagos archipelago, due to persistent warm water temperatures. On September 6, the MFR classified it as Tropical Disturbance A2, and the next day, the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 3S while the storm was over the northeastern portion of the basin. This was a fairly unusual event, as there is only an average of 0.4 storms in the month of September across the southern hemisphere. Located along the northern side of a ridge, the storm tracked westward, but failed to intensity beyond 1-minute winds of 75 km/h (45 mph) due to wind shear. On September 10, the storm dissipated to the west-southwest of Diego Garcia. On January 3, the BoM and the JTWC ceased issuing advisories on Tropical Cyclone Phil in the Australian region, which previously moved over Western Australia. The system continued to the west, entering the south-west Indian Ocean on January 5\\\\. On January 8, the remnants of Phil slowed and turned to the southeast. The next day, the JTWC began reissuing advisories on Phil. The storm meandered and executed a small loop, and in the process reached peak 1-minute winds of 85 km/h (50 mph). Phil turned back to the southwest, and the JTWC ceased issuing advisories on January 12. Four days later, the circulation dissipated. Also in January, the JTWC briefly tracked Tropical Cyclone 18S from the Australian region, which entered the south-west Indian Ocean on January 12\\\\. At that time, the storm had peak 1-minute winds of 85 km/h (50 mph), although it quickly weakened and dissipated on January 13. A tropical disturbance developed in late November, and two disturbances formed in the first few weeks of January. In the duration between when Iletta developed on January 23 and when Tropical Cyclone Josie formed on February 9, another two tropical disturbances formed, and the final two developed after Lisette originated in late February. The first, Tropical Disturbance M1, formed on May 11 in the northeastern portion of the basin, and later crossed into the Australian region to intensify into Tropical Cyclone Rhonda. The final disturbance of the season originated from a persistent area of convection near the equator on July 19, northeast of Diego Garcia. With warm enough water temperatures, the system developed further, becoming Tropical Depression M2 on July 20, the first July depression since 1971. That day, the JTWC classified the storm as Tropical Cyclone 01S. As the JTWC considers the tropical cyclone year to begin on July 1, and the MFR considered it beginning on August 1 at the time, the storm was in different cyclone years in different agencies. Estimates from the Dvorak technique suggested that the system approached tropical storm status on July 21 after a central dense overcast formed, although the MFR only estimated peak 10-minute winds of 55 km/h (35 mph). Moving southwestward and later to the west, the depression began weakening due to wind shear on July 23, and dissipated two days later. At the time, July was within the annual tropical cyclone year, although a change in policy shifted the end of the tropical cyclone year to June 30, beginning in 2002.

It consists of situated amidst the Cedars of Lebanon State Forest. The park and forest are approximately south of Lebanon, Tennessee. Cedars of Lebanon State Forest is known for its cedar glades, a unique type of ecosystem that has adapted to the thin (or nonexistent) soil layers that often occur in the eastern Central Basin. These glades are typically flanked by thick stands of red cedar, a type of juniper tree that can survive in soil layers too thin to support most large wooded plants. The presence of the red cedar in the basin reminded the region's early Euro- American settlers of the Lebanese cedar forests of Biblical fame. Geographical setting Cedars of Lebanon State Park is situated in the eastern Central Basin approximately west of the eastern Highland Rim, east of Nashville and north of Murfreesboro. U.S. Route 231, which runs north-to- south, splits the state forest into eastern and western sections. The state park (i.e., the developed area) is located in the eastern section along Cedar Forest Road. The western section consists of an undeveloped state forest. of the western section has been classified as a state natural area.\\"Cedars of Lebanon State Forest.\\" Retrieved: 12 August 2008. Like most karst areas, Cedars of Lebanon State Forest is drained in large part by underground streams. The water in the forest likely flows into nearby streams, such as Hurricane Creek.Charles Wilson, Jr., Geology of Cedars of Lebanon State Park and Forest and Vicinity in Wilson County, Tennessee (Tennessee Division of Geology, 1980), 9. These streams empty into the Stones River's J. Percy Priest Lake impoundment, which is located a few miles west of the park. Natural information Sinkhole along the Hidden Springs Trail Cedars of Lebanon State Forest is underlain by Ordovician period limestone, formed roughly 460 million years ago from calcareous ooze deposited by a primordial sea that once covered Middle Tennessee. Weathering of this rock has led to the creation of karst formations such as joints, underground streams, caves, and sinkholes, which are common throughout the park and forest.Charles Wilson, 18. The forest is located in a flat section of the Central Basin characterized by thin soil layers where the limestone bedrock is often exposed.Information obtained from interpretive signs at Cedars of Lebanon State Park, 9 August 2008. Cedar glade communities have adapted to the basin's harsh barrens, where the soil is too thin to support most plant types, especially large wooded plants. The glades are typically open areas resembling rock or gravel-strewn meadows. Most glades include small areas of bare rock where nothing grows, gravelly areas where only grasses grow, and patches of very thin soil that support shrubs and small red cedars. Cedar glades are typically surrounded by stands of red cedar known as cedar thickets. Beyond the cedar thickets, the soil is thick enough to support a hardwood forest consisting primarily of oak and hickory. The cedar glades of Cedars of Lebanon State Forest are home to 350 plant species, 29 of which are endemic to the cedar glades. Flowering plant species living in the glades include the formerlyMorgan Simmons, Rare Tennessee Coneflower Makes a Comeback, Knoxville News Sentinel, 4 August 2011. Retrieved: 4 August 2011. endangered Tennessee Coneflower (Echinacea tennesseensis), the Prickly Pear cactus (Opuntia humifusa), Limestone flame flower (Phemeranthus calcaricus), Gattinger's Prairie Clover (Dalea gattingeri), Glade Phlox (Phlox bifida), and Nashville Breadroot (Pediomelum subacaule). Nonflowering plants include reindeer moss and glade moss. Along with the red cedar, trees in the surrounding forest include white oak and shagbark hickory. Wildlife chiefly consists of rodents and birds. History The earliest Euro-American settlers arrived in Wilson County in the late 1790s. The city of Lebanon, established in 1802, was named after the abundance of red cedar in the area. The settlers believed (mistakenly) that the red cedar stands were similar to the cedar forests of ancient Lebanon, which were harvested by Phoenician city-states and used in the construction of the Temple of Solomon. The first Wilson County courthouse and many other early structures in the county were constructed using red cedar logs.James Drake, An Historical Sketch of Wilson County, Tennessee (Lebanon, Tenn.: The Press of the Democrat, 1976), 14. Originally published in 1879. For much of the 19th century, the barren glades were largely devoid of human habitation, with the exception of a few small farms. In an 1879 essay on the history of Wilson County, James Drake described the various soil types in the county, which included a \\"dark soil, peculiar to the cedar flats, the least desirable of any we have, and subject to drought, being usually near the rock.\\"Drake, 10. The town of Gladeville was established in 1852 just west of the modern state forest boundaries and grew into a sizeable hamlet until the outbreak of the American Civil War.Drake, 16. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the high demand for lumber led to the harvesting of most of the forests in the Central Basin. Red cedar in particular was popular for use in the making of furniture, fence rails, and pencils. In the cedar flats of Wilson County, small farmers were struggling with depletion of the already-thin soil layer caused by poor farming tactics. In 1935, as part of the New Deal, the federal government initiated a plan to resettle farmers living in badly eroded lands to allow the devastated forests to recover. As part of the Lebanon Cedar Forest Project, the federal Resettlement Administration helped move the farmers in the cedar flats to new locations, and the Works Project Administration constructed forestry and recreational facilities and planted thousands of red cedar seedlings. The work was supervised by the United States Forestry Service. \\"Lebanon Cedar Forest\\" officially opened in 1937, with local newspaper editor Dixon Merritt presiding over the opening ceremony. Although the land was managed by the Tennessee Department of Conservation, the federal government retained ownership until 1955.\\"History of Cedars of Lebanon State Park.\\" Retrieved: 13 August 2008.Sandy Suddarth, \\"Cedars of Lebanon State Park.\\" The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2002. Retrieved: 14 August 2008. Botanists began noting the ecological importance of the cedar glades as early as 1901, when German-born doctor Augustin Gattinger (1825‚Äì1903) mentioned the glades in his book The Flora of Tennessee and the Philosophy of Botany. Research conducted by Elsie Quarterman of Vanderbilt University led to the forest's designation as a National Natural Landmark in 1973. In 1995, Cedar Lodge and several other structures built by the WPA in the 1930s and 1940s were placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The park today Jackson Cave Cedars of Lebanon State Park has 117 campsites, 11 picnic shelters, of hiking trails, a group lodge, and a meeting hall. A small museum, the Merritt Nature Center, displays some of the forest's natural features. The park also maintains a disc golf course. The park's eight miles (13 km) of hiking trails range in size from . The Cedar Glades Trail, which begins at the park visitor center, is a self-guided interpretive trail that crosses several cedar glade habitats characteristic of glades found in the eastern basin. The Cedar Forest Trail, which begins near the junction of Cedar Forest Road and WPA Road, loops through a mixed oak-hickory and red cedar forest and passes several sizeable sinkholes and blockfields. The Dixon Merritt Trail begins behind the Merritt Nature Center and provides access to Jackson Cave. The Limestone Sinks Trail is another self-guided trail that passes several large limestone sinks. The Hidden Springs Trail, which starts near the picnic area, loops through multiple terrain types characteristic of the state forest, including a large limestone sink and associated dry streambed, several substantial cedar glades, and a dense stand of mixed red cedar and oak-hickory forest. Jackson Cave is one of 18 known caves located in the state forest and the immediate vicinity. The cave's entrance is wide and high, and the cave corridor has an average width of and an average height of . The cave extends approximately from its entrance to a large pool of water.Wilson, 14.

He is a major contributor to work on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide metabolism, who discovered the eukaryotic nicotinamide riboside (NR) kinase pathway. Education and career Brenner is a graduate of Wesleyan University and a veteran of biotechnology companies, having worked at Chiron Corporation and DNAX Research Institute, prior to graduate school at Stanford University School of Medicine. Brenner conducted post-doctoral research at Brandeis University with Gregory Petsko and then took his first academic position at Thomas Jefferson University in 1996, moving to Dartmouth Medical School in 2003, where he served as Associate Director for Basic Sciences at Norris Cotton Cancer Center. He was recruited to chair biochemistry at University of Iowa in 2009. Research contributions Brenner has made multiple contributions to molecular biology and biochemistry, beginning with purification and characterization of the Kex2 proprotein convertase at Stanford. He has been funded by agencies including the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the March of Dimes, the Burroughs Wellcome Fund, the Beckman Foundation, the Lung Cancer Research Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and the National Science Foundation. Significant research projects include molecular dissection of the function of the FHIT tumor suppressor gene, characterization and inhibition of DNA methylation, and discovery of new steps in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide metabolism. Notably, the Brenner laboratory discovered that yeast and humans use nicotinamide riboside to make NAD+, for which Brenner was recognized with a William E.M. Lands lectureship at University of Michigan. Dr. Brenner developed targeted, quantitative analysis of the NAD+ metabolome and made fundamental contributions to NAD metabolism including discovery of nicotinic acid riboside-dependent NAD synthesis, elucidating the mechanism of synthesis of nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate, and discovering multiple conditions in which NAD metabolism is dysregulated in disease. Brenner is also active in translating NR technologies to treat and prevent human conditions including diabetic and chemotherapeutic peripheral neuropathy,New Vitamin May Relieve a Painful Problem Focus April 20, 2008 heart failure, and central brain injury. This work includes the first human trial of NR, which demonstrated safe oral availability as an NAD+ precursor. Though Brenner was the first to show that NR increases SIR2 activity and can extend yeast lifespan, his work has not emphasized sirtuins or nonspecific anti-aging claims and instead emphasizes how NR repairs metabolic stresses that dysregulate NAD+ and NADPH. He recently showed that rodent postpartum mothers are under severe metabolic stress to their NAD system and that supplementing such mothers with NR increases maternal weight loss, advances juvenile development and provides long lasting neurodevelopmental advantages into adulthood.. Brenner is author of more than 140 publications and was the senior editor of the 2004 book, Oncogenomics: Molecular Approaches to Cancer. Educational contributions In 2012, Brenner was asked by the President of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology to develop pre- medical curriculum recommendations that would be consistent with a revised MCAT examination.Response to the new MCAT: ASBMB premedical curriculum recommendations ASBMB Today, March 2012 These recommendations, which include development of inorganic, organic and biochemistry coursework that is more geared toward the chemistry of bioorganic functional groups, have been further refined in academic journals. Brenner's work in this area was recognized by the 2016 ASBMB Award for Exemplary Contributions to Education. Industrial collaborations Brenner is a former member of the Scientific Advisory Board of Sirtris Pharmaceuticals. He is the founder of NRomics and was a co-founder of ProHeathspan prior to its acquisition by ChromaDex, for which he serves as member of the scientific advisory board and chief scientific advisor.

Plot summary After several failed attempts to seek Senate approval for his Supreme Court nominations, perpetually unpopular President Donald P. Vanderdamp (nicknamed \\"Don Veto\\" by Congress) decides to get even by nominating Judge Pepper Cartwright, star of Courtroom Six and America's most popular TV judge, to the Supreme Court. Soon, Cartwright finds herself in the middle of a Constitutional crisis, a Presidential campaign, and entanglements both political and romantic in nature. Analysis As described by Buckley on The Daily Show on October 21, 2008, the judge character is an attractive, gun- toting, glasses-wearing spitfire who is inexperienced in politics, drawing the obvious comparison to 2008 Republican Vice President Nominee Sarah Palin. However, Buckley finished the novel in January, months before Senator John McCain announced his choice. He then jokingly announced his retirement from satire, to which host Jon Stewart replied \\"Once the satirical book comes true within six months, you're done.\\" The Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dexter Mitchell has characteristics similar to Joe Biden, who chaired U.S. Supreme court nominations in his tenure. Buckley describes the character as \\"the cosmetically enhanced chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee who ran unsuccessfully for president and who never shuts up.\\" He has admitted that the chairman in the book is based on Joe Biden. Many media pundits recognized the book's main conflict between the Chairman and Judge Cartwright as directly paralleling the contest between Vice-Presidential Democratic nominee Joe Biden and Republican nominee Sarah Palin.

Opening on 30 September 1931, it branched off the Ekeberg Line at Jomfrubr√•ten and had three stops along the route‚ÄîEkebergparken, Smedstua and Simensbr√•ten. Operated by Ekebergbanen, the line was closed on 29 October 1967. It is the only light rail line in Oslo to have been closed. __TOC__ Route Tram at Jomfrubr√•ten about to divert to the left to leave the Ekeberg Line and enter the Simensbr√•ten Line The Simensbr√•ten Line was a long branch of the Ekeberg Line. It branched off south of Jomfrubr√•ten and had three stations: Ekebergparken, Smedstua and Simensbr√•ten. The line started at above mean sea level and terminated at above mean sea level. The line served the areas of Ekeberg and Simensbr√•ten. In rush hour Ekebergbanen provided direct services to the city center, but otherwise only provided a shuttle service to Jomfrubr√•ten. History In 1918, AS Ekebergbanen sent an application to build a funicular from Gamlebyen (then called Oslo) to Ekebergplat√•et. This application was recommended by Aker Municipal Council, but the idea was rejected by the Tramway Committee for Kristiania and Aker. They felt a funicular was not an appropriate and efficient means of transport for the planned residential areas at Ekebergplat√•et. Instead, they recommended a light rail. Oslo City Council stated on 27 April 1921 that instead a branch of the Ekeberg Line should be built from Sportsplassen Station to Simensbr√•ten, in addition to the funicular. A committee was established with representatives from the municipalities of Oslo, Aker, and Ekebergbanen. It saw the benefits of both lines, but recommended that the light rail be prioritized. Negotiations started between the municipalities and the company. Ekebergbanen stated that it was not possible to operate the branch line profitably, and that they could not raise sufficient capital to build the branch. In April 1922, the three made an agreement about the branch. However, at the time the plateau was being considered as one of the possible locations for the new airport to serve Oslo, and this delayed the planning. In 1927, concession was granted by royal resolution, after it had been decided to build the new airport at Fornebu. From the opening day, 30 September 1931, at Smedstua Construction of the line started in December 1928 During construction, the Ekeberg Line past Jomfrubr√•ten was moved. Instead of following Kongsveien, it was moved further up. The double-tracked Ekeberg Line was placed on the new line, while the Simensbr√•ten Line would follow the old route along Kongsveien. The Simensbr√•ten Line would thus cross under the Ekebergn Line and then through a curve turn onto its right-of-way. The Simensbr√•ten Line was completed in mid-1931 and It was officially opened on 30 September 1931. The line was never profitable, and needed municipal grants to operate. The Simensbr√•ten Line was planned extended onwards to Lambertseter. In December 1931, concession for the extension was sent, either east or west of Brannfjellet. The application was amended in 1932 all the way to Nordstrandveien. In 1938, the application was approved by the Parliament of Norway, but Oslo and Aker municipalities could not agree on the route along Brannfjellet. In addition, Aker insisted that the Ekeberg Line first be extended south of S√¶ter before the Simensbr√•ten Line be extended. A compromise was never found, and the line never extended. Tram at Simensbr√•ten World War II and the limitations on fuel gave the Ekeberg Line a large increase in traffic Unlike many other Norwegian tramways, the tram vehicles were not confiscated and moved to Germany, because no German tramways used both 1,200 volts and allowed wide vehicles. Following the end of the war, it was decided that Oslo and Aker would merge. Ekebergbanen's concession lasted until 30 June 1947, which was initially extended on year. In March 1948, Oslo Sporveier, the municipal company that operated among other things the street tramways, offered to purchase Ekebergbanen. All but eight shares were sold, and from December the board of Ekebergbanen and Oslo Sporveier was identical. However, the company retained its own name, administration, rolling stock and personnel. After the nationalization, the company started a renovation process of the infrastructure and rolling stock. Combined with a municipal policy of low fares, the company started going with a loss. Five new trams were delivered from 1948 to 1952, and built at the depot at Holtet, with used equipment from some of the older trams. An additional nine new trams were delivered between 1952 and 1955. Five additional trams were rebuilt from 1955 to 1960, by which time all the narrow trams had been rebuilt or retired. The use of a unique voltage gave operational difficulties, as fuses could regularly blow at Oslo Hospital if errors where done while switching from the one current to the other. In addition, all the trams were custom built with extra equipment with limited spare parts. All the trams delivered during the 1950s were built so they could later be converted to only use 600 volt power. The depot was expanded in 1952. Last day of operations, 29 October 1967 In 1960, the Oslo City Council voted to close the street tramway and replace all routes with either diesel buses or the Oslo Metro. The specific plans for the Ekeberg Line were not decided, although the line was considered either to be a stand-alone light rail or connected to the metro. From 30 October 1960, the route for the Simensbr√•ten Line trams in the city changed, so they instead followed the route Schweigaards gate ‚Äì Vognmannsgata ‚ÄìJernbanetorget ‚Äì Kirkeristen to Stortorvet instead of the old route via Gr√∏nland and Brugata. From 1963, the route terminated at Jernbanetorget, after the rest of the route was closed due to the construction of the metro. From 1 July 1965, Oslo Sporveier took over the operation of the Simensbr√•ten Line, which was numbered Line 16. Oslo Sporveier took over all employees and rolling stock, but Ekebergbanen remained a holding and real estate company. Immediately following the take-over, Oslo Sporveier introduced a 20-minute headway and suggested that the line be closed and replaced by buses from 29 October 1967, when the √òstensj√∏ Line of the metro opened. Following the closing of Sagene Ring, there were increased protests against closing the tramway. Traffic had decreased on the Ekeberg Line, but proponents for keeping it stated that this was because Oslo Sporveier had reduced the frequency and moved the end station out of the core of the city center. When the proposal to close the Ekeberg Line was considered by the city council, it was decided that only the Simenbr√•ten Line was to be closed. The Simensbr√•ten Line is the only light rail line in Oslo to have been closed. It was replaced by a bus route that went up the other side of the hill, and did not correspond with the Ekeberg Line.

It began on April 25, 1970, at the Forum in Inglewood, California, and ended on September 6, 1970, at the Love & Peace Festival in Fehmarn, Germany. The majority of the 37 shows were in the United States, with two each in Sweden, Denmark, and Germany, and one in England, where Hendrix was the final act at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970. After experimenting with different lineups following the breakup of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Hendrix brought back Experience drummer Mitch Mitchell with bassist Billy Cox replacing Noel Redding to record and tour. Hendrix continued to perform Experience numbers along with newer material from the live Band of Gypsys album and songs that he was developing for a fourth album. Soon after their performance at the Isle of Wight, the tour was cut short due to Cox's illness and Hendrix was left considering his options. However, he died twelve days after the Fehmarn concert. Several concerts were recorded and filmed that were later released on albums and film. Since their debut in 1971, the Berkeley, Atlanta, and Isle of Wight performances have been reissued several times, most recently as Blue Wild Angel: Live at the Isle of Wight (2002), Live at Berkeley (2003), and Freedom: Atlanta Pop Festival/Jimi Hendrix: Electric Church (2015). Concert selections continue to be included on Hendrix retrospectives and documentaries, such as Voodoo Child: The Jimi Hendrix Collection (2001), which contains five songs recorded during the tour. Background Following Noel Redding's departure from the Experience on June 29, 1969, Hendrix called on Billy Cox, an Army buddy and early bandmate, to play bass. In July, Hendrix, Cox, and Experience drummer Mitch Mitchell moved to a rural retreat in upstate New York and began rehearsing with an expanded lineup, which included rhythm guitarist Larry Lee and percussionists Juma Sultan and Jerry Velez. One month later, the group debuted at the Woodstock festival. After a couple of gigs and recording sessions, it became apparent that the group, sometimes referred to as \\"Gypsy Sun and Rainbows\\" after a comment Hendrix made at Woodstock, was not making sufficient progress. Hendrix still wanted to experiment with a different backup but return to the trio configuration, so drummer Buddy Miles replaced Mitchell with Cox remaining on bass. However, the new trio, often called the Band of Gypsys, was similarly short-lived. Hendrix's tour manager, Gerry Stickells, believed \\"Jimi's own lack of commitment to the Band of Gypsys concept [was] its fatal flaw\\". Hendrix expressed his dissatisfaction with the subsequent Band of Gypsys live album and Cox saw it as a stopgap measure to meet a contractual obligation. With the return of Mitchell alongside Cox, Hendrix's latest group had only one member change from either the Experience or the Band of Gypsys. A new name for the group was never officially adopted, but concert promoters often billed them as the \\"Jimi Hendrix Experience\\". Later, the group was informally referred to as \\"Cry of Love\\" and the name was used as the title for the first posthumous collection of Hendrix's new songs, The Cry of Love. With the March‚ÄìJune 1970 releases in the US and UK of the Woodstock film and soundtrack and Band of Gypsys, Hendrix remained one of the biggest rock concert attractions. In an interview shortly after the tour began, Hendrix explained \\"I called the tour 'the Cry of Love' because that is what it's all about... I'd like to play some festivals but I wish they would break up the events a bit for the audiences. There's no reason why these huge crowds should not be entertained by side attactions as well\\". During this period, demonstrations, riots, and clashes with the police occurred at several concerts. Some of Hendrix's performances were met with demands that they be free events, such at the Berkeley Community Theatre (May 30) and the New York Pop Festival (July 17), where they led to violent confrontations. At this time, Hendrix was also writing and recording songs for a planned fourth studio album. In early June after many delays, his new recording facility, Electric Lady Studios, was operational. Hendrix was able to get his manager, Michael Jeffery, to agree to limit his concert appearances to three-day weekends, so the group could return to New York City to record during the rest of the week. There were some stretches when the group took time off: they only performed twice between May 10 and June 5 (three gigs were cancelled due to illness); and twice between June 27 and July 17. The group spent most of August recording at Electric Lady, before the official opening party on August 26. Afterwards, Hendrix departed for England and the European segment of the tour. For his first appearance in England in eighteen months, Hendrix was one of the top-billed events at Isle of Wight Festival 1970. A few dates later, Cox became ill and had to return to the US to recover. So, after performing at only seven European concerts, the tour was cancelled. Hendrix stayed in London, where he attended parties and jammed with other musicians. He was considering whether to find a new bass player and met with Chas Chandler, the producer of Are You Experienced and Axis: Bold as Love. However, Hendrix died on September 18, 1970. Repertoire Throughout the tour, Hendrix continued to perform Experience material and introduced several newer songs. \\"Purple Haze\\" and \\"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\\" were frequent concert closers; \\"Foxey Lady\\", \\"Red House\\", \\"Fire\\", and \\"Hey Joe\\" were concert staples as they had been in Experience performances. Hendrix also continued to perform popular songs that dated back to the Experience, but not yet recorded to his satisfaction, such as \\"Lover Man\\", \\"Hear My Train A Comin'\\", and \\"Roomful of Mirrors\\". From his time with Cox and Miles, he added \\"Machine Gun\\", \\"Message to Love\\", and \\"Ezy Ryder\\". Hendrix also had a number of new songs that were still in development that he chose to include in his concerts: \\"Freedom\\" and \\"Hey Baby (New Rising Sun)\\" were among the most played new numbers; others, such as \\"Straight Ahead\\", \\"In from the Storm\\", \\"Dolly Dagger\\", and \\"Midnight Lightning\\" were performed occasionally. The songs signaled a new direction in Hendrix's music, which biographer John McDermott describes as \\"music of a more mature and refined Experience... reflecting a more subtle and intricate approach\\". Biographer David Moskowitz identifies the songs performed on July 26 at the Sick's Stadium in Seattle, Washington (Hendrix's birthplace), as representative of the Cry of Love repertoire: *\\"Fire\\" *\\"Message to Love\\" *\\"Lover Man\\" *\\"Machine Gun\\" *\\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" *\\"Purple Haze\\" *\\"Hear My Train A Comin'\\" *\\"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\\" *\\"Hey Baby (New Rising Sun)\\" *\\"Freedom\\" *\\"Red House\\" *\\"Foxey Lady\\" Despite being one of his best- selling singles, Hendrix usually ignored requests for \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" during his tours with the Experience. However, after the song's debut at the Swing Auditorium in San Bernardino, California, on June 20, he performed it more often. Cox wished to delve deeper into Hendrix's catalogue: \\"I wanted to play those songs... I wanted him to play 'Crosstown Traffic,' but we never got around to rehearsing it.\\" However, Hendrix occasionally surprised him ‚Äì at a May 16 gig at Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Cox recalled: Hendrix also performed \\"Johnny B. Goode\\" at the first show on May 30 at the Berkeley Community Theatre. During the afternoon rehearsals, the group tried out another rock and roll classic, Carl Perkins' \\"Blue Suede Shoes\\". In Europe, Hendrix reached back to his early career for a couple of performances of Howlin' Wolf's \\"Killing Floor\\" and the Muddy Waters tribute \\"Catfish Blues\\".

This centre is specialized in the study and analysis of the transmission of scientific, medical, environmental and technological knowledge to society. The journalist Vladimir de Semir, associated professor of Science Journalism at the Pompeu Fabra University, was the funder and is the current director of the centre. A multidisciplinary team of researchers coming from different backgrounds (i.e. journalists, biologists, physicians, linguists, historians, etc.) is working on various lines of research: science communication; popularization of sciences, risk and crisis communication; science communication and knowledge representation; journalism specialized in science and technology; scientific discourse analysis; health and medicine in the daily press; relationships between science journals and mass media; history of science communication; public understanding of science; gender and science in the mass media, promotion of scientific vocations, science museology, etc.\\"Between fast thinking and genuine culture\\" Interview with V. de Semir in RTD Info - Magazine on European Research, November 2005  PCST Network & Academy  The Science Communication Observatory is linked to the international network on Public Communication of Science & Technology (PCST), which includes individuals from around the world who are active in producing and studying PCST through science journalism, science museums and science centers, academic researchers in social and experimental sciences, scientists who deal with the public, public information officers for scientific institutions and others related to science in society issues. The PCST Network sponsors international conferences, electronic discussions, and other activities to foster dialogue among the different groups of people interested in PCST, leading to cross-fertilization across professional, cultural, international, and disciplinary boundaries. The PCST Network seeks to promote new ideas, methods, intellectual and practical questions and perspectives.The International Public Communication of Science and Technology Network Pierre Fayard, Paola Catapano and Bruce Lewenstein, June 2004 The first conference held by the PCST Network was at Poitiers, France in 1989. Since then biennial conferences have been held in Madrid (1991), Montreal (1994), Melbourne (1996), Berlin (1998), Geneva (2000), Cape Town (2002), Barcelona (2004), Seoul (2006), Malmo/Copenhagen (2008) and New Delhi (2010). The 2012 conference is scheduled for Florence in 2012. With events in Melbourne, Beijing, Seoul and Cape Town, the Network expanded from its European origins to become a truly international network. The Scientific Committee managing the organisation is drawn from 19 different countries ranging across the globe. The Committee is chaired by Mr Toss Gascoigne (Australia). The Science Communication Observatory hosts the PCST Academy. The PCST Academy is responsible for the creation of the documentary basis of the Public Communication of Science and Technology network (PCST) and its main task is the selection and organized collection of articles, reports and resources on particular topics in the field of communication and social understanding of sciences. As stated by the Chair of the Network from 2004 to 2006, Vladimir de Semir, the Academy looks for the necessary resources at international level to guarantee the access to the network of representatives from those countries that currently have to face more difficulties: ‚ÄúThe main aim is to represent and include the multiplicity of identities existing in the world, because the study and practice of science communication should respect the different cultural contexts and integrate the knowledge coming from all continents.‚Äù  Teaching, publishing and collaborative projects  The Science Communication Observatory runs a Master in Science, Medical and Environmental Communication in Barcelona (Spain) since 1995Master in Scientific, Medical and Environmental Communication Journal of Science Communication, March 2009 and a Diploma in Science Communication in Buenos Aires (Argentina) since 2008 and other courses and workshops about science communication and the popularization of science. The Science Communication Observatory also publishes Quark, a journal about ‚ÄúScience, Medicine, Communication and Culture‚Äù, and also carries on researches and analysis in the Science in Society field, working with other European institutions and academic groups on several European projects such as: ‚Ä¢ PLACES - Platform of Local Authorities and Communicators Engaged in Science, a four-year European project establishing and developing the concept of the European City of Scientific Culture. The project focuses on developing and strengthening City Partnerships, bringing together 67 science centres, museums, festivals and events, each partnering with local authorities, and 10 European regional networks. The project facilitates cooperation among these alliances to structure their science communication activities, sharing tools, resources and results. ‚Ä¢ KiiCS - Knowledge Incubation in Innovation and Creation for Science, the project aims to build bridges between arts, science and technology by giving evidence of the positive impacts of their interaction for creativity as well as for triggering interest in science. The project will stimulate co-creation processes involving creators and scientists, and nurture youth interest in science in a creative way. (KiiCS starts 15 February 2012) ‚Ä¢ MASIS - Monitoring Policy and Research Activities on Science in Society in Europe, project to develop structural links and interaction between scientists, policy-makers and society at large, therefore an instrumental tool in relation to stimulating further cooperation in Europe and reducing fragmentation through the identification of common resources, common trends, common interests, and common challenges. ‚Ä¢ ESCITY - Europe, Science and the City: promoting scientific culture at local level, an initiative to create the core of a network for the exchange of information and best practices in the area of promoting scientific culture, with two particular characteristics; focusing on local and regional action and emplacing strategies that situate the promotion of scientific culture under the umbrella of cultural policies. ‚Ä¢ ESConet - European Science Communication Network, which brings together experienced science communication lecturers, researchers and practitioners from across Europe to train natural scientists and technologists to communicate effectively with the media, policy-makers and the general public. As well as delivering these core communication skills, ESConet workshops encourage scientists to reflect critically on the social, cultural, and ethical dimensions of their scientific work. ‚Ä¢ E-KNOWNET - Network for ICT- enabled non-formal science learning, a project supported by the Lifelong Learning Programme of the European Commission to develop an innovative and viable ICT-enabled mechanism for fast and efficient sharing of new knowledge among larger non-expert segments of society, in forms suitable for non-formal learning. ‚Ä¢ STEPE - Sensitive Technologies and European Public Ethics project is innovative in contributing to the early identification of potentially controversial technological developments and related public ethics, by systematically considering both the view of key stakeholders in technological, political and societal life and the perceptions of European citizens in 25 European member states, thereby contextualising the findings by a systematic analysis of policy developments both on national and European levels. The interdisciplinary and multi-method approach will aim at establishing an integrated European Map of Public Ethics. It is the aim to stimulate new, empirically grounded, thinking on public ethics as a contribution to wider debates and policy making on responsible technological innovation. As a key data source, the proposal is based on the triennial Eurobarometer survey on the Biotechnology and the Life Sciences. ‚Ä¢ Benchmarking the Promotion of RTD culture and Public Understanding of Science to establish the current state of RTD culture in Member States, to provide a survey of the ongoing activities, and to recommend measures to be followed to improve the present situation. In order to clarify the meaning behind the vocabulary used in different Member States, our introduction also contains an analysis of the concepts behind ‚ÄúPublic Understanding of Science‚Äù, ‚ÄúPublic Understanding of Science and the Humanities (Wissenschaft)‚Äù and ‚ÄúCulture Scientifique‚Äù. Scientific Knowledge and Cultural Diversity The Science Communication Observatory was responsible of the organization of the 8th International Conference of the PCST Network in Barcelona (Spain), June 2004. The main theme of the conference was \\"Scientific Knowledge and Cultural Diversity\\" which opened up a field to debate on the global discourse of science in a range of local culture and knowledge environments. When talking about various cultures we are referring to the different groups sharing the same language, same traditions, ideology or religion, inhabiting in a specific geographical environment, having the same job, or being a man or a woman, a young, a child, an elder‚Ä¶ All this rich cultural diversity also reflects its stamp on scientific knowledge, in its creation and application as well as in the whole process of public communication of science and technology. The main theme of \\"Scientific Knowledge and Cultural Diversity\\", included 3 subthemes or discussion subjects. Native Knowledge & Modern Science Cultural diversity. Traditional knowledge. Local wisdom. Regional identity and globalization. Indigenous knowledge system. Citizenship participation on scientific decisions. Popular culture and scientific culture. Possibilities of native knowledge facing with new technologies. Science ethics and believes. Religion or morality influence in knowledge construction. Cohabitation between medicines with different evaluation systems. Knowledge, religion and beliefs. Parasciences. Science as a universal knowledge Intellectual property. Gender and cultural approach. New models, trends and concepts in PCST. Science Communication: Historical Perspectives And New Trends Influences of historical processes on science communication. The greatest science communicators. The role of the mass media. The role of science centres and museums. Main initiatives in the promotion of scientific culture. Results analysis methodology. International networks. New models, trends and concepts in PCST. Science Communication & Social Participation Peripheral science and science in the outskirts. Science culture and cooperation with illiterate population and marginal groups. Social inclusion. Public engagement with science policy (consensus conferences, citizen juries, deliberative polling). Science vocations in the changing world. Media impact on science opinion. Science festivals. Ethics of science communication. Public policies in scientific culture. Citizen participation on scientific decisions. Informal science education. Science centers and museums. Science communication training. New models, trends and concepts in PCST. European Forum on Science Journalism In December 2007, the Science Communication Observatory organized with the European Commission the European Forum on Science Journalism (EFSJ) where leading science journalists and editors of national newspapers and specialised science publications from across Europe and the world met in Barcelona to discuss the challenges in reporting on science, the impact of new technologies on the profession and importance of linking science to society and everyday life together with leading scientists and top science communication professionals from across Europe, the US, Canada, China and Australia. A Special Eurobarometer on scientific research in the media and a European Guide to Science Journalism Training were presented in this forum. How to strengthen science coverage in the European press?

Another DVDPG edition was released on September 26, 2002, this time entitled Kango Shichauzo Maioka Wonderful. It was localized in North America as I'm Gonna Nurse You by G-Collections. The English version was released on June 24, 2003. Since its second revision, both current Japanese and English versions have \\"Voice Plus!\\" as an additional subtitle to denote the inclusion of original voice actresses recordings for characters in the game. The game also has two erotic sequels, one being Kango Shichauzo 2 ~Joshi Ryou wa Moeteiru ka~, which was released in Japan for the PC on April 19, 2002, and released as a DVD TV game on November 27, 2003 by Trabulance. Like the first game, it was also localized in North America by G-Collections, on June 24, 2003. Lastly, the third game entitled Kango Shichauzo 3 ~Kangofu-san wa Amaenbo~ was only released in Japan for the PC on July 16, 2004. Plot Shinobu Nakagawa is a newly licensed pediatrician employed at the fictional St. Michael's General Hospital in Tokyo, Japan. One evening during work, he receives a telephone call from his foster mother, Kaede Maioka, requesting his company at her house. Though personally bothered at this inconvenience, he reluctantly agrees to visit. Upon his arrival, Shinobu receives the proposition to fill-in for a sick professor at the Saint Michael's Nursing School; an all-girls institution near the hospital. The offer is met with negative reception until Shinobu realizes his efforts upset Kaede, leading him to sympathetically accept. It is shortly after this that Shinobu learns his foster stepsister, Momiji Maioka, is also an enrolled student to the same school. The following morning he visits the school for orientation and is introduced to three affectionate young girls who happily befriend him. While each one, including Shinobu's own foster family, harbor amorous feelings for him, only through careful judgment will one particular woman outstand the rest and win his heart. Gameplay Kango Shicyauzo is played like a traditional visual novel; the player advances through scenes with character dialog, and making decisions based on scripted dilemmas which occur. Gameplay selections branch to different plotlines, usually leading to Shinobu monogamously dating, sexually engaging, and marrying one of the primary female cast members. If however, the player fails to establish a relationship, Shinobu will be called back to mandatorily work at the hospital; thus, ending the game early. An exclusive plotline, known as the Harem Route or Playboy Route, becomes available when the player completes each of the female's individual storylines. Through this special path, Shinobu will be engage in polyamorous group sex with the female characters, instead of gradually developing a relationship with just one of them. Game progress can be saved by the player at any time, and a prompt to remind a player to save at important points can be enabled. Hints can be set to give the player an additional choice at decisions to directly or indirectly show what outcome a choice may lead to. Characters ; : :A recently finished postdoctoral researcher, Shinobu Nakagawa is a physician whose main focus of practice is pediatrics. His initial idea of becoming a temporary instructor at a woman's nursing school greatly distresses him, but over time he acclimates with his new environment and becomes quite fond of it. As a handsome bachelor, he receives constant admiration from the student body, especially his closest peers, who all desire to be his girlfriend. Although he can be somewhat stubborn and tactless, Shinobu is in fact a benevolent young man who wishes to see his newly assigned students succeed. ; : :Voluptuous and enticing, Kaede Maioka is a Clinical Nurse Specialist who volunteers at the Saint Michael's General Hospital and officially works as an instructor at the school. She is Shinobu's foster mother, whose profession in health care led to both his and Momiji's interest in the field. While Kaede is proficient when it comes to her work, she often desires lecherous activity outside her medical duty at the most inappropriate of times, usually having Shinobu participate with her. Despite this, Kaede is a caring woman, who enjoys seeing her friends and patients happy. Age unknown. : ; : :Momiji Maioka is Kaede's only biological daughter and Shinobu's foster stepsister. Her personality is effervescent in nature, usually to other's chagrin, but she can and does become serious when necessary. Since childhood Momiji has stayed close to Shinobu as a friendly companion, and now as a mature adolescent, her feelings have developed into a passionate attraction to him. Fueled by ambitious determination, Momiji strives to achieve the same level of nursing expertise as her mother, and ultimately work alongside Shinobu at the hospital. Age 18. : ; : : Another enrolled student, Nanana Yoshino is Momiji's best friend. She is incredibly dainty, optimistic, shy and clumsy; usually to her own humiliation. Her attraction to Shinobu is deep, and the desire to express appreciation for his kindness is what unfortunately generates conflict within her friendship with Momiji. Having been hospitalized as a child and recuperated by a nurse, Nanana wishes to also excel in health care and, like Momiji, work alongside Shinobu. Age 18. : ; : :Emi Katakura is a Roman Catholic nun who, like Kaede Maioka, volunteers at the Saint Michael's General Hospital, works as an instructor at the school, and additionally performs religious services at the nearby Catholic Church. Gentle and slow, Emi does her best to soothe the mental health of patients and educate students in the field of medicine. Her interpretation of God's will, and the messages she claims to receive from him through prayer, however, are somewhat unorthodox, and vaguely excuse her from breaking celibacy; especially when she becomes intimate with Shinobu. Age unknown. : ; : :Gentle, focused, and intelligent, Chisa Mutsuki is the elected Class President for the student body of the Saint Michael's Nursing School. Her dedication to her studies is unusually obsessive, and as a direct result, lacks an ordinary social life and the ability to make or retain friendships. She takes a passionate interest in Shinobu for his concern of her solitary behavior, and follows his advice to become more outgoing. With parents who manage their own hospital, Chisa desires to train herself to a professional degree in nursing and, unsurprisingly, assist Shinobu in his hospital of choice. Age 18. : Music * Opening and Closing theme song: NURSING SAMBA ÔΩûÁÅºÁÜ±„ÅÆÊôÇÈñì„Å®„ÅçÔΩû (NURSING SAMBA~ Shakunetsu no Jikan Toki~) :Arrangement by Tasogare no Yume :Lyrics by Takeshi Yokoyama :Vocals by Noriko Saito : The shortened version of this song is available to freely listen to here Development Patches On March 21, 2006 G-Collections released a software patch for owners of the first original release of Kango Shicyauzo, as explicit renders had been censored.

Parc Ltd got a second loan from Omnicorp Overseas Ltd (which was part of the same group, and whose parent was managed by Mr Herzig), which got another charge. Banque Financiere de la Cite, a Swiss bank, gave Parc Ltd a third loan of DM30million but got no charge. Instead it got a ‚Äòpostponement letter‚Äô saying other companies in the group (including OOL) would not enforce their charges until BFC had been paid. Parc Ltd used the loan to pay off RTB. But OOL had given no authority to Parc Ltd to give that letter. Parc Ltd went insolvent. BFC claimed subrogation to be paid in priority of OOL, but OOL contested. Judgment The House of Lords held that BFC should be subrogated in priority to OOL, because this was the ultimate intention of the letter, and otherwise OOL would be unjustly enriched by the advance of the loan. Lord Steyn said the following. Lord Griffiths concurred. Lord Hoffmann said the following on the principles behind liability in unjust enrichment.[1999] AC 221, 227 Lord Clyde agreed, saying the claim was based in unjust enrichment, or nemo debet locupletari aliena jactura.

The Bank of Jamaica was told the money was for foreign currency purchased by its agents. They gave the money to the agents, but the agents were fraudsters. Dextra wanted restitution. Judgment The Privy Council held that the claim failed, first because Dextra had made no relevant mistake of fact, and second because the Bank of Jamaica had changed its position. On the question of the change of position defence, Dextra argued that the Bank of Jamaica were relatively at fault, and therefore their defence should fail. Lord Bingham and Lord Goff said in the course of their advice, Comment The decision in Dextra has been broadly accepted by academic lawyers, although it has been pointed out that the difference between a \\"misprediction\\" and a \\"mistake of fact\\" is a very narrow one. In the court held that where the claimant paid drachmas into an account under the mistaken belief that the drachmas would be converted into US dollars, that was a mistake of fact which could found a restitutionary claim.

The primary source of the story is \\"The Great Cherokee Children Massacre at Ywahoo Falls\\", written by Dan Troxell. The story is also mentioned in the 1999 book, Hiking the Big South Fork, which gives Troxell as its source. Eventually the tale caught the attention of Dr. Kenneth Tankersley of the Native American Studies program at Northern Kentucky University who wrote an article called \\"Yahoo Falls Massacre, McCreary County, Kentucky\\" in the mid-2000s (apparently part of his upcoming book, Kentucky Cherokee: People of the Cave), though the only references he supplies directly related to the story of the massacre itself are oral interviews with members of the Troxell family.Tankersley, Kenneth Barnett, PhD, \\"Yahoo Falls Massacre, McCreary County, Kentucky\\", http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~brockfamily/YahooFalls- byKTankersley.html The alleged massacre According to the tale, in order that the women and children of the Cumberland River valley might acquire a white-man's education, the Reverend Gideon Blackburn proposed to open a school on Cherokee land 125 miles away near Chattanooga (the story claims the school was in Sequatchie Valley), and on the day in question it was arranged that anybody seeking protection at the school should meet at Yahoo Falls at full moon. According to the story, they were to be led by the supposed \\"Cornblossom\\", alleged daughter of the War Chief Doublehead, but were instead massacred by a contingent of soldiers sent by John Sevier, who was from the State of Tennessee not the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Parts of Tennessee were at times called Kentucky. Tradition supports Cherokee Chief Arun or Aaron Brock Redbird as having been somehow connected to the events. Chief Redbird and some Cherokee Chiefs also appear to have fought in the Kings Mountain, NC area with the Colonials in the U.S. Revolutionary War in the Battle of Kings Mountain or other nearby battles. Later, many Cherokee linked to them turned against the Colonials like Shelby who supported removing and killing Indians, including Cherokee. Shelby was Kentucky's first Governor after the state gained independence from Virginia. Many of these peoples, Cherokee and white and others also had Carolina and other southern state connections. The Massacre Story seems to support oral and other stories since Kentucky did support removing the Cherokee and other indigenous people from the state. Controversy Doubt has been expressed as to whether the massacre ever actually occurred. There are apparently no contemporary records that document (or even mention) the massacre, nor any that record the existence of a \\"Princess Cornblossom\\" (not to mention that no such title as \\"Princess\\" ever existed among the Cherokee). Though the story is recorded as Cherokee oral history, it is unlikely that such an event could have gone completely undocumented, and no evidence has been found. The first written record of Cornblossom seems to occur in 1958 in a publication called Legion of the Lost Mine by Thomas H. Troxel,Troxel, Thomas H. (1958) Legion of the Lost Mine, Cumberland Publishing Company, Oneida, Tennessee but Troxel admits in the foreword to his book that some of the characters in it are fictitious (though he doesn't say which). There is no mention of the massacre in this book; the first mention of that seems to be in the 1975 book A History of the Daniel Boone National Forest 1770-1970, written by Robert F. Collins, with the Yahoo Falls section based upon information assembled by Troxel. Monument On August 12, 2006, persons unknown placed an unofficial monument to the alleged massacre in the Daniel Boone National Forest (DBNF), next to the grave of one Jacob Troxell, who died 10 October 1810. In late September 2007, DBNF officials removed the monument for two reasons: first, it is illegal to put up a monument on federal land without permission, and second, they questioned whether the incident had actually taken place.

Pam could always be relied on to help out, especially if it benefited one of her four children.\\" The BBC said Pam's most notable moment was \\"Kicking Doug out of the house after having he told her about his affair with Jill Weir.\\" Adam Willis Adam Willis, played by Ian Williams, made his first appearance on 9 August 1990. Williams was invited to play the role of Adam shortly after he appeared in Bony, another Grundy production.

He is widely regarded as a pioneer of Israeli rock due to his work in Israel in the 1960s and 1970s with his band, The Churchills, and with prominent Israeli artists such as Arik Einstein. Early life Huxley was born in Gloucester, England and educated at Sir Thomas Rich‚Äôs Grammar School. After leaving school in 1962, he joined a local band, the Vendettas, as vocalist in 1963. Professional career After the Vendettas, Huxley moved on to join the Whirlwinds as lead singer under the name \\"Robb Gayle\\". After a recording audition with Joe Meek, the Whirlwinds changed their name to the Saxons and dyed their hair blond. While still semi- pro they released a single through Joe Meek in 1965; an instrumental written by Pete Holder and Robb Huxley titled \\"Saxon Warcry\\". In December 1965, Joe Meek summoned the Saxons to London to work professionally as his house band, renamed The Tornados. They were also known as the New Tornados. During their short association with Joe Meek, they put out two singles. ‚ÄúPop-Art Goes Mozart‚Äù / ‚ÄúToo Much in Love to Hear‚Äù and ‚ÄúIs that a Ship I Hear‚Äù / ‚ÄúDo You Come Here Often‚Äù. Both singles were released in 1966. Nowadays ‚ÄúDo you Come Here Often‚Äù is recognized as being the first ever openly ‚Äúgay‚Äù song to be released on record. Almost a year after Joe Meek‚Äôs death in a shooting incident at his Holloway Road studio, with only Robb Huxley and Dave Watts remaining from the original line up, the Tornados left for a tour of Israel. Early in February 1968 in Tel-Aviv, the Tornados disbanded, which ended Joe Meek‚Äôs succession of Tornados. In Israel Huxley remained in Israel and played with a three piece group called Purple Ass Baboon for a short time. The group was probably the first ever ‚Äúpunk‚Äù style band to play in Israel. Huxley met up with Stan Solomon, Canadian singer with the Israeli band the Churchills and was invited to join the band when two members were subscripted into the Israeli army. Huxley and Solomon went on to write the music for the Churchills‚Äô only album, which was written in part for the Israeli film, A Woman‚Äôs Case. The vinyl album is acclaimed today to be the rarest psychedelic record in the world, and is also recognized for its musical content. Huxley went on to write for Israeli singers, the most prominent being Arik Einstein who had a hit ‚ÄúAkhinoam Lo Yoda'at\\" (\\"Akhinoam Doesn't Know\\", eng. \\"When You‚Äôre Gone\\") which Huxley had written for the Churchills. Huxley and Einstein collaborated on an album of children‚Äôs songs, with melodies written by Huxley and lyrics by Einstein. After Stan Solomon quit the Churchills in 1969, the band became Arik Einstein‚Äôs backing band. They were also joined by singer Danny Shoshan, a former bass player and vocalist from the Lions. In 1970, they recorded an album, Junkies, Monkeys and Donkeys at Red Bus Records in London, with music written by Huxley and Shoshan and changed their name to Jericho Jones. They went on to record a second album under the name of Jericho, again with Huxley / Shoshan compositions. In 1972, bass player Miki Gavrielov and drummer Ami Trebich returned to Israel. Shoshan took over the bass with Huxley and Haim Romano on guitars. They took on British drummer Chris Perry. They put out two singles, but after a tour of South Africa in 1973, Jericho disbanded due to management, personal and record label problems. Huxley's work in Israel, particularly with the Churchills and with Einstein, made him become widely regarded as one of the pioneers of Israeli rock. Huxley moved to Miami in 1974, where he still lives with his Israeli wife.

Account-based marketing is typically employed in enterprise level sales organizations. Account based marketing can help companies to: * Increase account relevance * Engage earlier and higher with deals * Align marketing activity with account strategies * Get the best value out of marketing * Inspire customers with compelling content * Identify specific contacts, at specific companies, within a specific market While business marketing is typically organized by industry, product/solution or channel (direct/social/PR), account-based marketing brings all of these together to focus on individual accounts. As markets become increasingly commoditized, customers see little or no difference between suppliers and their competitors, with price as the only obvious differentiators.  Background and differences with traditional business marketing  In the marketing of complex business propositions, account-based marketing plays a key role in expanding business within existing customer accounts (where, for example, wider industry marketing would not be targeted enough to appeal to an existing customer). In scenarios where the initial sale has taken several months, it is reported that account-based marketing delivers an increase in the long-term value of the customer.Account-based marketing: How it can help your company improve demand, awareness and profitability ABM can also be applied to key prospect accounts in support of the first sale. For example, Northrop Grumman employed ABM to aid in the completion of a successful $2 billion deal.How Northrop Grumman Used Account-Based Marketing to Win a $2B Deal Research demonstrates that buyers are looking for their existing suppliers to keep them updated with relevant propositions, but are often disappointed with this. In UK research, existing suppliers came top of all the different information channels that IT buyers use to look for new solutions ‚Äì but more than 50% felt that marketing by their suppliers was poor. The research also demonstrates how much easier it is for organizations to generate more sales from existing customers than from new customers - 77 per cent of decision-makers say that marketing from new suppliers is poorly targeted and makes it easy to justify staying with their current supplier. By treating each account individually, account-based marketing activity can be targeted more accurately to address the audience and is more likely to be considered relevant than untargeted direct marketing activity.  The roles of sales and marketing teams  ABM is an example of the alignment of sales and marketing teams.Kotler, Rackham and Krishnaswamy; Ending the War Between Sales and Marketing (2006) Harvard Business Review In the aligned model, organizations able to unite tactical marketing efforts with defined sales goals and use feedback from sales to identify new potential markets. For ABM to succeed, joint working relationship with sales is essential and marketing needs to be measuring and optimizing based on accounts. ABM is targeted at accounts (or companies as a whole) as opposed to traditional inbound marketing, which is targeted at leads (or people within these companies). The need for sales and marketing alignment also comes from the fact that there is an inherent disconnect between marketers, who market to people, and sales people, who sell to companies (or structured groups of people). Marketing will also take an increased role in developing intelligence on key accounts ‚Äì as proposed by Peppers and Rogers (1993): ‚ÄúWhen two marketers are competing for the same customer‚Äôs business, all other things being equal, the marketer with the greatest scope of information about that particular customer [‚Ä¶] will be the more efficient competitor.Peppers and Rogers; The One-to-One Future (1993); Page 140‚Äù  Account-based marketing and the IT industry  Organizations which are seeing the greatest current benefit from account-based marketing are IT, Services and Consulting companies. With complex propositions, long sales cycles and large customers, these organizations are ideal candidates for the approach. It is, though, spreading into other sectors and a benefit can be seen to be an increased return on time (ROT). Many suppliers have woken up to the fact that the revenues of some of their customers exceed the GDP of some nation states. They are changing the amount of their resourcing accordingly.  Choosing the key account  Key accounts are accounts that are identified within organizations as being a focus for account-based marketing. Not all accounts meet the requirements to be designated as a strategic or key account and organizations need to be careful about which accounts to focus on for their account-based marketing efforts or risk losing a valuable client. When choosing, organisations should look at revenue history, account history, margins and profitability as well as the viability that the client in question would be interested in a long-term relationship. Lastly, asking what the client and the company have in common helps in solidifying the approach that the client cannot find this kind of service anywhere else. To select the companies that bring you the highest profits you can apply the Pareto Principle. There are also some red flags that help recognize that a relationship with a key account is about to change: * Business that regularly would have come to the company goes elsewhere * A re-organization within the company forces a change in relationship * Both involved companies aren't seeing ROI from the relationship * Mutual goals are not achieved  References  Sales ","title":"Account-based marketing"},{"id":"18863463","text":"Orrin Anthony Barton (born October 17, 1969) is an American retired high jumper.

Right: \\"Chinese character\\" in Simplified Chinese The Chinese family of scripts are writing systems descended from the Chinese Oracle Bone Script and used for a variety of languages in East Asia. They include logosyllabic systems such as the Chinese script itself (or hanzi, now in two forms, traditional and simplified), and adaptations to other languages, such as Kanji (Japanese), Hanja (Korean), Ch·ªØ n√¥m (Vietnamese) and Sawndip (Zhuang). More divergent are Tangut, Khitan large script, and its offspring Jurchen, as well as the Yi script and possibly Korean Hangul, which were inspired by Chinese although not directly descended from it. The partially deciphered Khitan small script may be another. In addition, various phonetic scripts descend from Chinese characters, of which the best known are the various kana syllabaries, the zhuyin semi-syllabary, n√ºshu, and some influence on hangul. The Chinese scripts are written in various calligraphic hands, principally seal script, clerical script, regular script, semi-cursive script, and cursive script. (See Chinese calligraphy and Chinese script styles.) Adaptations range from the conservative, as in Korean, which used Chinese characters in their standard form with only a few local coinages, and relatively conservative Japanese, which has coined a few hundred new characters and used traditional character forms until the mid-20th century, to the extensive adaptations of Zhuang and Vietnamese, each coining over 10,000 new characters by Chinese formation principles, to the highly divergent Tangut script, which formed over 5,000 new characters by its own principles.  Chinese script   Origins  Ox scapula inscribed with Oracle Bone Script, the ancestor of the Chinese family of scripts An example of Chinese bronze inscriptions, on a bronze vessel dated to the early Western Zhou period, 11th century BC The earliest Chinese writing consists of divinatory texts inscribed on ox scapulae and tortoise plastrons found at the last Shang dynasty capital near Anyang and dating from 1200 BC. This Oracle Bone Script shows extensive simplification and linearization, which most researchers believe indicates an extensive period of development. Although some Neolithic symbols have been found on pottery, jade or bone at a variety of sites in China, there is no consensus that any of them are directly related to the Shang oracle bone script. Bronze inscriptions from about 1100 BC are written in a developed form of the script and provide a richer body of text. Each character of the early script represents a word of Old Chinese, which at that time was uniformly monosyllabic. The strategies used are traditionally classified into six categories (ÂÖ≠Êõ∏ li√πsh≈´ \\"six writings\\") first recorded in the second century dictionary Shuowen Jiezi. Three of these categories involved a representation of the meaning of the word: # Pictograms (Ë±°ÂΩ¢Â≠ó xi√†ngx√≠ngz√¨) represent a word by a picture (later stylized) such as r√¨ \\"sun\\", r√©n \\"person\\" and m√π \\"tree\\". # Ideograms (Êåá‰∫ãÂ≠ó zh«êsh√¨z√¨) are abstract symbols such as sƒÅn \\"three\\" and sh√†ng \\"up\\". # Semantic compounds (ÊúÉÊÑèÂ≠ó hu√¨y√¨z√¨) combine simpler elements to indicate the meaning of the word, as in l√≠n \\"grove\\" (two trees). Evolved forms of these characters are still in among the most commonly used today. Words that could not be represented pictorially, such as abstract terms and grammatical particles, were denoted using characters for similar- sounding words (the rebus strategy). These phonetic loans (ÂÅáÂÄüÂ≠ó ji«éji√®z√¨) are thus new uses of existing characters rather than new graphic forms. An example is l√°i \\"come\\", written with the character for a similar-sounding word meaning \\"wheat\\". Sometimes the borrowed character would be modified slightly to distinguish it from the original, as with w√∫ \\"don't\\", a borrowing of m«î \\"mother\\". Phono-semantic compounds (ÂΩ¢ËÅ≤Â≠ó x√≠ngshƒìngz√¨) were obtained by adding semantic indicators to disambiguate phonetic loans. This type was already used extensively on the oracle bones, and has been the main source of new characters since then. For example, the character originally representing jƒ´ \\"winnowing basket\\" was also used to write the pronoun and modal particle q√≠. Later the less common original word was written with the compound , obtained by adding the symbol zh√∫ \\"bamboo\\" to the character. Sometimes the original phonetic similarity has been obscured by millennia of sound change, as in g√© < *krak \\"go to\\" and l√π < * \\"road\\". Many characters often explained as semantic compounds were originally phono-semantic compounds that have been obscured in this way. Some authors even dispute the validity of the semantic compound category. The sixth traditional category (ËΩâÊ≥®Â≠ó zhu«énzh√πz√¨) contained very few characters, and its meaning is uncertain.  Styles  Development and simplification of the script continued during the Western Zhou and Spring and Autumn periods, with characters becoming less pictorial and more linear and regular, with rounded strokes being replaced by sharp angles. During the Warring States period, writing became more widespread, with further simplification and variation, particularly in the eastern states. After the western state of Qin unified China, its more conservative seal script became the standard for the whole country. A simplified form known as the clerical script became the standard during the Han dynasty, and later evolved into the regular script still used today. At the same time semi-cursive and cursive scripts developed. The Traditional Chinese script is currently used in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau. Mainland China and Singapore use the Simplified Chinese variant.  Dialectal writing  Until the early 20th century, formal writing employed Literary Chinese, based on the vocabulary and syntax of classical works. The script was also used less formally to record local varieties, which had over time diverged from the classical language and each other. The logographic script easily accommodated differences in pronunciation, meaning and word order, but often new characters were required for words that could not be related to older forms. Many such characters were created using the traditional methods, particularly phono-semantic compounds.  Adaptations for other languages  The Chinese script was for a long period the only writing system in East Asia, and was also hugely influential as the vehicle of the dominant Chinese culture. Korea, Japan and Vietnam adopted Chinese literary culture as a whole. For many centuries, all writing in neighbouring societies was done in Classical Chinese, albeit influenced by the writer's native language. Although they wrote in Chinese, writing about local subjects required characters to represent names of local people and places; leading to the creation of Han characters specific to other languages, some of which were later reimported as Chinese characters. Later they sought to use the script to write their own languages. Chinese characters were adapted to represent the words of other languages using a range of strategies, including * representing loans from Chinese using their original characters, * representing words with characters for similar-sounding Chinese words, * representing words with characters for Chinese words with similar meanings, * creating new characters using the same formation principles as Chinese characters, especially phono-semantic compounds, and * creating new characters in other ways, such as compounds of pairs of characters indicating the pronunciation of the initial and final parts of a word respectively (similar to Chinese fanqie spellings). The principle of representing one monosyllabic word with one character was readily applied to neighbouring languages to the south with a similar analytic structure to Chinese, such as Vietnamese and Zhuang. The script was a poorer fit for the polysyllabic agglutinative languages of the north-east, such as Korean, Japanese and the Mongolic and Tungusic languages.  Korean  Chinese characters adapted to write Korean are known as Hanja. From the 9th century, Korean was written using a number of systems collectively known as Idu, in which Hanja were used to write both Sino-Korean and native Korean roots, and a smaller number of Hanja were used to write Korean grammatical morphemes with similar sounds. The overlapping uses of Hanja made the system complex and difficult to use, even when reduced forms for grammatical morphemes were introduced with the Gugyeol system in the 13th and 14th centuries. The Hangul alphabet introduced in the 15th century was much simpler, and specifically designed for the sounds of Korean. The alphabet makes systematic use of modifiers corresponding to features of Korean sounds. Although Hangul is unrelated to Chinese characters, its letters are written in syllabic blocks that can be interspersed with Hanja. Such a Korean mixed script became the usual way of writing the language, with roots of Chinese origin denoted by Hanja and all other elements rendered in Hangul. Hanja is still used (but not very commonly like the Japanese) and is required in both North and South Korea. Historically, a few characters were coined in Korea, such as ; these are known as gukja (/).  Japanese  Katakana with man'y≈çgana equivalents (segments of man'y≈çgana adapted into katakana shown in red) Development of hiragana from man'y≈çgana Chinese characters adapted to write Japanese words are known as kanji. Chinese words borrowed into Japanese could be written with the Chinese character, while Japanese words could be written using the character for a Chinese word of similar meaning. Because there have been multiple layers of borrowing into Japanese, a single kanji may have several readings in Japanese. Other systems, known as kana, used Chinese characters phonetically to transcribe the sounds of Japanese syllables. An early system of this type was Man'y≈çgana, as used in the 8th century anthology Man'y≈çsh≈´. This system was not quite a syllabary, because each Japanese syllable could be represented by one of several characters, but from it were derived two syllabaries still in use today. They differ because they sometimes selected different characters for a syllable, and because they used different strategies to reduce these characters for easy writing: the angular katakana were obtained by selecting a part of each character, while hiragana were derived from the cursive forms of whole characters. Such classic works as Lady Murasaki's The Tale of Genji were written in hiragana, the only system permitted to women of the time. Modern Japanese writing uses a composite system, using kanji for word stems, hiragana for inflexional endings and grammatical words, and katakana to transcribe non-Chinese loanwords. A few hundred characters have been coined in Japan; these are known as kokuji (), and include natural phenomena, particularly fish, such as È∞Ø (sardine), together with everyday terms such as ÂÉç (work) and technical terms such as ËÖ∫ (gland).  Vietnamese  Vietnamese was first written from the 13th century using the Ch·ªØ n√¥m script based on Chinese characters, but the system developed in a quite different way than in Korea or Japan. Vietnamese was and is a strongly analytic language with many distinct syllables (roughly 4,800 in the modern standard language), so there was little motivation to develop a syllabary. As with Korean and Japanese, characters were used to write borrowed Chinese words, native words with a similar sound and native words with a similar meaning. In the Vietnamese case, the latter category consisted mainly of early loans from Chinese that had come to be accepted as native. The Vietnamese system also involved creation of new characters using Chinese principles, but on a far greater scale than in Korea or Japan. The resulting system was highly complex and was never mastered by more than 5% of the population. It was completely replaced in the 20th century by the Latin-based Vietnamese alphabet.  Zhuang  Zhuang has been written using Sawndip for over a thousand years. The script uses both Chinese characters and new characters formed using the traditional methods, as well as some formed by combining pairs of characters to indicate the pronunciation of a word by the fanqie method. The number of new created characters is similar in scale to the Chu nom of Vietnam. Even though an official alphabet-based writing system for Zhuang was introduced in 1957, Sawndip is still more often used in less formal situations.„ÄäÂπøË•øÂ£ÆÊóè‰∫∫ÊñáÂ≠ó‰ΩøÁî®Áé∞Áä∂ÂèäÊñáÂ≠óÁ§æ‰ºöÂ£∞ÊúõË∞ÉÊü•Á†îÁ©∂„Äã \\"Research into survey of the scripts used by Zhuang in Guangxi\\" ÂîêÊú™Âπ≥ Tang Weiping http://www.doc88.com/p-644582398739.html  Others  Several peoples in southwest China recorded laws, songs and other religious and cultural texts by representing words of their languages using a mix of Chinese characters with a similar sound or meaning, or pairs of Chinese characters indicating pronunciation using the fanqie method. The languages so recorded included Miao, Yao, Bouyei, Kam, Bai and Hani. All these languages are now written using Latin-based scripts. Chinese characters were also used to transcribe the Mongolian text of The Secret History of the Mongols.

Scripts influenced by Chinese  Bronze edict plate with Tangut characters Between the 10th and 13th centuries, northern China was ruled by foreign dynasties that created scripts for their own languages. The Khitan large script and Khitan small script, which in turn influenced the Tangut script and Jurchen script, used characters that superficially resemble Chinese characters, but with the exception of a few loans were constructed using quite different principles. In particular the Khitan small script contained phonetic sub-elements arranged in a square block in a manner similar to the more sophisticated Hangul system devised later for Korean. Other scripts in China that borrowed or adapted some Chinese characters but are otherwise distinct include Ba‚ÄìShu scripts, (only Áéã (\\"king\\") known) Geba script, Sui script, Yi script and the Lisu syllabary.

In 2007 he was the gold prize winner at the International Tchaikovsky Competition. Biography Born in Moscow in 1983 to two cellists, one a teacher at the Central Music School at the Moscow Conservatory, the other a Bolshoi Symphony Orchestra cellist, Antonov began studying the cello at age five. After graduating from the Moscow Conservatory, he studied at an advanced level with, among others, the legendary Mstislav Rostropovich. He is currently an Artist Diploma student at Boston's Longy School of Music. In 2008, he inaugurated, together with pianist Constantine Finehouse, the Trieste Chamber Music Association's Salotto Cameristico to great acclaim. Hailed as ‚Äú‚Ä¶a brilliant cellist‚Ä¶‚Äù (M.

May 2, 2008). Cellist Sergey Antonov ‚Äú‚Ä¶ literally spellbound the rapt audience ... with an expressive mastery of extraordinary maturity, realized through a technical skill exhibited without glitz but with the naturalness that characterizes a genial interpreter‚Ä¶‚Äù (Patrizia Ferialdi, Il Piccolo, Trieste, Italy. May 30, 2008). In the summer of 2007, Sergey became one of the youngest cellists to win a Gold medal at the International Tchaikovsky Competition. He has circled the globe, performing concerts in Japan, Korea, Bulgaria, Poland, Russia, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Sweden, Finland, United Arab Emirates and the US. He performs extensively with the most prominent orchestras, in the most prestigious halls of Russia, his home country, under the management of the Moscow Philharmony with whom he holds a five-year soloist contract. In the summer of 2008, Sergey had made his American debut at the Newport Music Festival followed by solo recitals at Estivales de musique en medoc 2008 in Bordeaux, France, concerts in Savonlinna, Finland as well as in St. Petersburg, Russia. In July, he performed a live concert on the Boston‚Äôs radio show ‚ÄúClassics in the Morning‚Äù with Cathy Fuller on WGBH 89.7 FM. Highlights of his 2008 season included a 10-concert tour of Japan and Korea in January/February, culminating with performances of the Brahms Double Concerto in Moscow's Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory. Other performances included appearances with the Petrozavodsk Symphony, chamber music collaborations with the Lyrica Chamber Music Series as their \\"Young Artist of the Year\\", and the Chamber Music Foundation of New England. He gave solo concerts in Trieste, Italy and chamber music concerts in Dubai, that were followed by concerts at the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory in performance of the Schumann cello concerto with Moscow Conservatory Symphony Orchestra . After his performance of the Elgar Cello Concerto with the Moscow Philharmonic in its \\"Stars of The 21st Century‚Äù series, a critic wrote ‚Äú‚Ä¶[Antonov] is ‚Ä¶unique‚Ä¶from a different world...a musician who has his own inner space‚Ä¶a performer, who turns each phrase, every deeply felt sound into an event of his own inner monologue‚Ä¶with such consciously developed nuances, sensitivity, such concentration in combination with the feeling of drama‚Ä¶‚Äù (Marina Borisova, Daily Telegraph, No.91, Moscow, Russian Federation. May 20, 2008). This season brought Sergey to Switzerland, Russia, Hungary and back to the U.S. to perform Tchaikovsky‚Äôs Rococo Variations with the Burlington Chamber Orchestra in the Lane series in Vermont and Longy Chamber Orchestra in Cambridge, Mass. In January 2009, Sergey has opened a new music series in Boston called ‚ÄúGreat Russian Years‚Äù dedicated to the Great Russian composers. In Spring 2009 he is scheduled to perform extensively in Russia (January, February, March, April), Spain (March), Italy, Sweden (April), and Serbia (May) with summer engagements in the United States at Newport and New Hampshire music festivals in July. Sergey Antonov was born in 1983 into a family of cellists. His parents guided his first years, especially his mother, Maria Zhuravleva, a leading cello pedagogue at the prestigious Central Music School at the Moscow Conservatory. His late father, Boris, was a gifted cellist and a member of the Bolshoi Symphony Orchestra.

Also known as the Merymare, Lonetree and Mae-Lou Ranch, it was a former homestead, expanded beginning in the 1920s by William Louis Johnson, then further developed in the 1930s by Alfred Berol (Berolzheimer). Johnson built a lodge, barn and boathouse in 1927, while Berol added a larger lodge, new boathouse, and cabins, all in the rustic style. After acquisition by the National Park Service, it was designated the University of Wyoming - National Park Research Station The research center is cooperatively owned by the National Park Service and the University, directed by University of Wyoming zoology professor Michael E. Dillon. Description Located on the shore of Jackson Lake north of Colter Bay Village, the ranch is notable for its high level of craftsmanship and attention to detail, comparable to that seen in contemporary National Park Service structures. The Berol Lodge is the most extensively detailed rustic structure in Grand Teton. Of the 17-building complex, 14 are considered contributing structures to the historic district. The Merymere Lodge was one of the first structures on the property. The principal buildings are the Johnson Lodge, built by William Johnson, and the Berol Lodge, built by Alfred Berol. History The original property was established in 1890 as a homestead rather than as a working ranch, the farthest north in Jackson Hole, by John Dudley Sargent and Robert Ray Hamilton. Sargent and Hamilton. Both men had been sent west by their families to put them at arms length, as remittance men. Sargent may have murdered Hamilton on Signal Mountain, which gained its name from the signal fire lit by searchers for Hamilton when they found his body. William Johnson was an executive of The Hoover Company, who acquired the Sargent Ranch in 1926, building a small lodge, garage and boathouse in 1927 using the log construction prevailing for dude ranches in Jackson Hole. Johnson died in 1931, and Berolzheimer, an officer of the Eagle (later Berol) Company, manufacturers of pencils, bought the ranch in 1936. Berol hired New York architect George W. Kosmak to design a new main lodge, boathouse, and cabins. Kosmak was assisted by Jackson architect Paul T. Colbron. In 1953 the ranch became a field research station, operated by the University of Wyoming. The AMK was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 23, 1990.

Andromeda may have been the first depiction on stage of a young man falling in love with a woman. The play has been lost; however, a number of fragments are extant. In addition, a number of ancient sources refer to the play, including several references in plays by Aristophanes. Plot Several aspects of the plot of Andromeda can be inferred from the extant fragments and references. The play opened with Andromeda alone on stage, having been chained to a rock near the sea and near a cave by her father Cepheus, King of Aethiopia, to be eaten by a sea monster. This was to mollify the sea god Poseidon after either Cepheus or his wife Cassiopeia had offended the god. Andromeda laments her fate alone, with only her echo to respond. A chorus of virgins (parthenoi) appears as Andromeda's lament continues. Then Perseus appears, using the crane to depict his flight on winged sandals, \\"planting my foot on high, cutting a path through the midst of the ether,\\" having just defeated the Gorgon Medusa. Upon appearing, Perseus believes Andromeda is a statue and remarks \\"Hold--what promontory do I see here, lapped by sea foam, and what maiden's likeness, a statue carved by an expert hand to her very form in stone?\\" When Perseus asks Andromeda if she will show his gratitude if he saves her, she responds \\"Take me, stranger, whether for servant, wife, or slave.\\" During their dialogue, Perseus apparently moved from being struck by Andromeda's beauty to feeling pity for her to falling in love with her. This may have been the first depiction of a man falling in love with a woman on stage. In fragment 136, Perseus famously demands of Eros to \\"either don't teach us to see beauty in what is beautiful, or help those who are in love to succeed in their efforts as they suffer the toils that you yourself have crafted,\\" stating further that if Eros does so he will \\"be honored by mortals\\" but if not those in love will no longer give Eros their gratitude. A messenger delivered the news that Perseus had successfully defeated the sea monster. The play also included scenes in which Perseus describes his adventure with Medusa and in which he insists on marrying Andromeda against Cepheus' wishes, but other scenes may have been included as well. Andromeda concurred that she wanted to live with Perseus rather than her parents, and some of the dialogue may have discussed the conflict between Andromeda's duty to her parents and her loyalty to Perseus, as well as the desirability of Perseus as a husband. The play most likely ended with the goddess Athena appearing as a deus ex machina to announce that Perseus and Andromeda would be married and that all the characters would become constellations. Athena likely also prophesied that the descendants of Perseus and Andromeda would become the rulers of Mycenae. Antecedents Little is known of treatments of the Andromeda myth prior to Euripides. However, Sophocles wrote a play entitled Andromeda, which covered the same story and was believed to have been performed around 450 BC. Sophocles' Andromeda is now lost except for a few fragments. Euripides treated earlier aspects of the Perseus myth in his earlier plays Danae (between 455 and 425 BC), which covered Perseus' birth, and Dictys (431 BC), which covered his defeat of Medusa. Later references to the play Information about Andromeda is largely based on later sources, including the Bibliotheca, Ovid's treatment of the story in Metamorphoses and references in astrological handbooks to the constellations Andromeda, Cepheus, and Cassiopeia, which refer to Euripides' play. There are also references to Andromeda in at least two plays by Aristophanes. In 411, a year after Euripides' plays were first produced, Aristophanes incorporated extended parodies of both Helen and Andromeda in his comedy Thesmophoriazusae. Euripides, who is a character in Thesmophoriazusae, needs to save a kinsman who was captured dressed as a woman infiltrating an all-woman festival. Euripides first attempts to do this by a parody of the scene in which Menelaus arrives dressed in rags. He then uses a parody of Andromeda in which the kinsman as Andromeda laments his fate to the response of his echo, Euripides as Perseus arrives via the crane, and falls quickly in love with her. In the parody, Perseus' love as depicted in Andromeda is transformed to lust. Aristophanes also referenced Andromeda in his 405 play The Frogs, where the god Dionysus states that while reading Andromeda he was smitten with longing for Euripides. It has been reported from antiquity that Alexander the Great was able to perform a portion of Andromeda by heart. Classicist Gilbert Murray commented that \\"Only a few fragments of the Andromeda remain, but they are curiously beautiful; and the play as a whole seems to have been the one unclouded love-romance that Euripides ever wrote. Murray also related a story told by Lucian (in \\"The Way to Write History\\") writing 500 years after Andromeda was first produced, that people in Abdera, Thrace, were stricken by the play and walked around \\"as though in a dream\\" while mumbling to themselves a speech from the play which began \\"O love, high monarch over gods and men...\\" References Plays by Euripides Lost plays ","title":"Andromeda (play)"},{"id":"18863586","text":"≈ûahverdili (also, ≈û…ôhverdili, Shakhverdili, and Shakh-Verdylyar) is a village and municipality in the Imishli Rayon of Azerbaijan.

The school, founded in 1991, was originally called Lok Sin Tong College and was situated at Hill Road, West Point. In 1993, it was renamed to Lok Sin Tong Leung Kau Kui College in appreciation of the prominent businessman and philanthropist, Dr. Leung Kau Kui. Dr. Leung had made generous contributions towards the construction of the school. The present site of the school at Hospital Road, Sai Ying Pun, was formerly occupied by multiple schools such as the Sir Ellis Kadoorie School, Helen Liang Memorial Secondary School, Yu To Sang Memorial Secondary School, and the Kennedy Town Government Secondary School.  Development  LSTLKKC is situated among traditionally prestigious schools within the Central and Western district of Hong Kong. The school faced several difficulties in the early years of its establishment, such as a shortage of school facilities, due to a rapid increase in enrollment numbers. The situation improved due to rectification efforts undertaken over the years. In 1997, the school underwent a major educational reform which led to a three- year cumulative increase of 148% in the passing rate of students undertaking the Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination. This remarkable result is testament to the effectiveness of various learning initiatives implemented that include classroom recognition, self-learning assessment, and sharing of extra-curricular reading. In a bid to remain abreast with the standards of the other prestigious schools within the locality, LSTLKKC strives to continue to improve through educational reform in areas such as subject structure, course content, teaching methods, and course preparation. From 2000 onward, LSTLKKC students achieved excellent scores in the Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination due to the educational reform efforts undertaken by the school. In addition, LSTLKKC allowed students who had good exam scores to switch from a science course to a business course, thereby attracting many students from traditionally prestigious schools who wanted to switch courses. The interaction between transfer students and elite students from LSTLKKC created a conducive learning environment that augmented the potential of LSTLKKC to improve the school's banding. In 2000, LSTLKKC gradually began rising in the banding system. This occurred in part due to lower standards in traditionally prestigious schools in the Western part of Hong Kong, and education system reforms. This has resulted in improvement in LSTLKKC students' grades, enabling LSTLKKC to absorb students from other schools. (The transfer students mainly come from Sacred Heart Canossian College, St. Louis School, and St. Stephen's School.) Immigrant students After the handover of Hong Kong, the government raised the quota of permanent residencies for children of Hong Konger parents who had been born in China. This resulted in many families migrating to Hong Kong to reunite the family. Some of these children were already in junior or senior high, making it difficult for them to find suitable schools when they entered Hong Kong. It was difficult for them to enter English schools as both getting accepted and getting used to the school was difficult. Furthermore, there were only two Chinese schools in the Central and Western administrative district, of which LSTLKKC was one of them. LSTLKKC took in many students who had migrated, most of whom enrolled in the high school. Those who entered the fourth year of high school had had senior high education in China, and as such obtained good grades in the national examinations. Release of results in national examinations In recent years, LSTLKKC has circulated the 'legendary' breakthrough results of its students in national examinations. This includes one student, who despite previously failing a science course, switched to a liberal arts entrance examination and obtained a good score of 3A1B. Students who had recently migrated also achieved decent grades in the national examinations. Criticism Some criticised the school's rules in the 90s as being too harsh.

History  During the Tsardom of Russia, Qaradonlu belonged to the Javad Khan administration. In 1906, the first School of Qaradonlu region was established, with many living-buildings, caravanserais, mills and shops in the area. In August 1930, Qaradonlu was organized in Mil-Mugan as a region. As early as the October Revolution, land-reclamation and irrigation work were made based on the intense irrigated plant-growing. In 1933, Qaradonlu Machine-Tractor Plant was built in the Qaradonlu historical region. As a result of the construction of the railway between ∆èl…ôt and Yerevan, people moved from the center of the region to suburbs of the railway stations. The population increase produced two-story brick buildings in Qaradonlu and Imishli. The regional capital was moved there and the region became Imishli Rayon. Imishli village also expanded. Government houses were constructed, completely transforming the village's appearance. In 1944, Imishli was awarded status of town-type settlement, progressing to city status in the 1960s.

The protected areas of Niger normally have a designation and status determined by the Government of Niger. Further, fourteen sites also have international designations, applied by UNESCO and the Ramsar Convention on wetlands protection. Protected lands in Niger are managed by a number of authorities, and the areas of authority and structure have changed a number of times since independence. Some of the first reserves, parks, and protected areas were designated under French Colonial rule and much of the legal regime is based on these colonial laws. Niger is also party to a number of international agreements and participates in international ecological, conservation, and resource management programs with its neighbors, region, and worldwide. Type and number of protected areas Protected lands in Niger fall under both national and international regulation, and are managed by elements of the Nigerien government, as well as regional bodies and international designation oversight bodies. Initial classification of lands as legally protected for conservation of flora, fauna, landscape, and resource protection was done under French Colonial rule beginning in 1936. Much of the legal framework of land management and protection is based on these original regulations. As of the late 1990s, most land management was the area of the Nigerien Natural Resource Management Unit (Cellule de Gestion des Resources Naturelles) of the Inter-ministerial Sub-committee for Rural Development (Sous-Comit√© Interminist√©riel charg√© de la politique de D√©veloppement Rural au Niger), which includes ministries focused on environmental issues, industrial resource extraction, economic growth, and farming. Nigerien designated protected areas were administered by the Direction of Fauna, Fisheries and Aquaculture (Direction de la Faune, de la P√™che et de la Pisciculture - DFPP) of the Ministry of Hydrology and the Environment (Minist√®re de l'Hydraulique et de l'Environnement - MHE). Actual protection is the responsibility of the DFPP's Fauna and Apiculture Management Service (Service d'Am√©nagement de la Faune et de l'Apiculture - SAFA) which in 1987 had only 40 staff actually managing or guarding sites.Niger Conservation , African Bird Club, African Birding Resources (2005-2008).

Clark, Jr. in Grand Teton National Park. The ranch was opened in 1924 with a dozen tent cabins and log buildings for a kitchen and dining hall, lounge and commissary. In 1943 Williams built log tourist cabins, followed by the larger dining hall in 1945. The 1985 Taggart Lake Fire destroyed much of the ranch, sparing only the dining hall and five cabins. The dining hall is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as an example of rustic architecture. Since 1970 the Double Diamond property has been a hostel for mountain climbers in the Teton Range, and is known as the Climbers' Ranch. History Frank Williams, originally from Colorado, was a local guide and former Bar B C Dude Ranch wrangler, who partnered with Clark, a young eastern dude from a wealthy Philadelphia family. Clark provided financial backing to open the Double Diamond in 1924 on a homestead claim that had been filed by Frank Williams' wife Emma. Clark, who had been to the Bar B C and who had met Williams at the Bar None ranch, later became mayor of Philadelphia and was a U.S. senator from 1957 to 1969. The ranch expanded from to in 1926 with the purchase of a portion of the neighboring Manges property. Catering primarily to boys from eastern families, accommodations consisted of tents, with a small dining hall, lounge and commissary. The ranch drew its clientele from the Philadelphia area, charging $800, including transportation from Philadelphia, for a June 15 - September 15 season. References were required for prospective dudes. The ranch had an initial capacity of 25 dudes, expanded in the 1930s to 35. Clark, who was launching a legal and political career, became less involved in the 1930s, finally selling his share to Harry and Nola Williams Brown in 1946, but buying back an acre for a summer cabin. Cabins were added in 1943 with a shift in emphasis to families. The main dining hall was built in 1945. Harry Brown and Nola Williams Brown, took half of the ownership in 1948. The Williams family continued to operate the Double Diamond until Frank's death in 1964, when the National Park Service bought the ranch for $315,000, retaining a lease to continue operations through 1969. The dining hall is a remnant pf the ranch complex, which was mostly destroyed by fire. Description The 1945 dining hall is a one-story U-shaped log building. It features a large stone fireplace and chimney on the north side. The former dining room is now a library and lounge, while the original commercial kitchen is a communal kitchen and dining area. The exterior is stained a uniform brown. Following local custom, the log chinking is covered with 1/4 pole strips. The five surviving original cabins (of 15 extant before the fire) are not part of the historic designation. New and relocated cabins have replaced those lost, in locations approximating the missing cabins. Two cabins, designed by Ogden, Utah architect Eber Piers, were moved from the Hunter Hereford Ranch, confusing the local historical context. The complex, including the dining hall, has been leased to the American Alpine Club since 1970. Renamed the Climbers' Ranch, the facility is a hostel for mountain climbers. The cabins are used for dormitory-style climber accommodations, while the dining hall is a shared facility. The Double Diamond dining hall was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 18, 1998.

At the 2008 Summer Olympics, her performance improved significantly, and she took home an individual bronze medal and was a scoring member of the gold-medal winning German team. She rode Bonaparte 67 at both the 2004 and 2008 Olympic Games. In 2006, Kemmer and Bonaparte also assisted the German team to a gold medal at the World Equestrian Games. Kemmer (center) with the gold medal winning German dressage team in 2008 Kemmer's international career stretches back to a silver medal win at the 1984 German Dressage Championships, followed by a lengthy break to focus on her schooling and profession as a business economist. She returned to the international competition ring in 1998, riding Caesar, and then moved to riding Albano for the 1999 season. Riding Albano, she again rose to prominence with another silver medal win at the 2000 German Dressage Championships. This was followed by a bronze at the same competition in 2001 and gold in 2005 and 2006. She also helped the Germans to team gold at the European Dressage Championships in 2001, 2003 and 2005, and was a reserve team member in 2007. Following their success at the 2008 Olympics, Kemmer and Bonaparte briefly had a successful return to the competition ring in early 2009. However, injuries later in the year prevented a return to the German team for the 2009 European Championships, and a diagnosis of Lyme disease for Bonaparte removed the possibility of competition in the 2010 competition. In 2011, Kemmer retired Bonaparte at the 2011 CDN Hanover show. In 2002, Kemmer and Bonaparte 67 were awarded the Otto Lorke Prize, which is given to the \\"most talented upcoming Grand Prix combination of the year in Germany\\", and in 2004 the horse was named Hanoverian of the Year. By 2013, she was riding two new horses at the international level: Rock My Soul at Intermediare I level and Quantico in Grand Prix competitions.

According to this approach, the interest rate is determined by the demand for and supply of loanable funds. The term loanable funds includes all forms of credit, such as loans, bonds, or savings deposits.  History  The loanable funds doctrine was formulated in the 1930s by British economist Dennis Robertson and Swedish economist Bertil Ohlin. However, Ohlin attributed its origin to Swedish economist Knut WicksellWicksell, K. (1898) Geldzins und G√ºterpreise. Jena: Gustav Fischer. and the Stockholm school, which included economists Erik Lindahl and Gunnar Myrdal.  Basic features  The loanable funds doctrine extends the classical theory, which determined the interest rate solely by saving and investment, in that it adds bank credit. The total amount of credit available in an economy can exceed private saving because the bank system is in a position to create credit out of thin air. Hence, the equilibrium (or market) interest rate is not only influenced by the propensities to save and invest but also by the creation or destruction of fiat money and credit. If the bank system enhances credit, it will at least temporarily diminish the market interest rate below the natural rate. Wicksell had defined the natural rate as that interest rate which is compatible with a stable price level. Credit creation and credit destruction induce changes in the price level and in the level of economic activity. This is referred to as Wicksell's cumulative process. According to Ohlin (op. cit., p. 222), one cannot say \\"that the rate of interest equalises planned savings and planned investment, for it obviously does not do that. How, then, is the height of the interest rate determined. The answer is that the rate of interest is simply the price of credit, and that it is therefore governed by the supply of and demand for credit. The banking system ‚Äì through its ability to give credit ‚Äì can influence, and to some extent does affect, the interest level.\\" In formal terms, the loanable funds doctrine determines the market interest rate through the following equilibrium condition: :PS + \\\\Delta B=PI, where P, S, I denote the price level, real saving, and real investment, respectively, while \\\\Delta B denotes changes in bank credit. Saving and investment are multiplied by the price level in order to obtain monetary variables, because credit comes also in monetary terms. In a fiat money system, bank credit creation equals money creation, \\\\Delta B=\\\\Delta M. Therefore, it is also common to represent the loanable funds doctrine as PS + \\\\Delta M=PI. The preceding description holds for closed economies. In open economies, net capital outflows must be added to credit demand.  Comparison with classical and Keynesian approaches  In classical theory, the interest rate i is determined by saving and investment alone: S(i)=I(i). Changes in the quantity of money do not affect the interest rate but only influence the price level (as per the quantity theory of money). Keynesian liquidity preference theory determines interest and income using two separate equilibrium conditions, namely, the equality of saving and investment, S(Y)=I(i), and the equality of money demand and money supply, L(Y, i)=M/P. This is the familiar IS-LM model. Like the classical approach, the IS- LM model contains an equilibrium condition that equates saving and investment. The loanable funds doctrine, by contrast, does not equate saving and investment, both understood in an ex ante sense, but integrates bank credit creation into this equilibrium condition. According to Ohlin: \\"There is a credit market ... but there is no such market for savings and no price of savings\\". An extension of bank credit reduces the interest rate in the same way as an increase in saving. During the 1930s, and again during the 1950s, the relationship between the loanable funds doctrine and the liquidity preference theory was discussed at length. Some authors considered the two approaches as largely equivalent but this issue is still unresolved.  Ambiguous use  While the scholarly literature uses the term loanable funds doctrine in the sense defined above, textbook authorsMankiw, N. G. (2013) Macroeconomics. Eighth edition: Macmillan, p. 68. and bloggersCf., for example, Mitchell, Bill. \\"The IMF fall into a loanable funds black hole again\\", 22 September 2009 sometimes refer colloquially to \\"loanable funds\\" in connection with classical interest theory. This ambiguous use disregards the characteristic feature of the loanable funds doctrine, namely, its integration of bank credit into the theory of interest rate determination.
