Schoenfeld, which tells the tales of a toy-maker's unhappiness with his domestic life and his seeking of an exciting adventure with an old flame who pops into town.Crowther, Bosley. \\"Screen: Domestic Tale; Palace Has There's Always Tomorrow\\" (The New York Times, January 21, 1956) Plot Toy manufacturer Clifford Groves has a life of boring routine in Pasadena. His wife Marion is busy raising their three children - Vinnie, Ellen, and Frankie. The children see their father as an annoyance and as little more than a walking wallet. Clifford feels like the robot toy his company is introducing, moving mechanically from place to place in his life. Then, a former co-worker, Norma Miller Vale, turns up at his home unexpectedly and reveals she is now a glamorous fashion designer. Just as Cliff is about to leave on a frequently mentioned but long-postponed vacation with Marion to Palm Valley, Frankie injures her ankle and Marion decides to stay home and tend to her. Since it's too late to cancel, she urges Cliff to go alone. He reluctantly agrees, scheduling a business appointment at the location, thus giving him at least some additionally justifiable reason for going. However, upon arriving and subsequently being informed that the meeting fell through, he bumps into Norma, who is revealed to be a lonely divorcee taking a brief vacation at the same resort. They enjoy the weekend together, in riding horses and dancing. Unexpectedly, Cliff's son Vinnie drives to Palm Valley with his girlfriend Ann, and two other friends. Cliff looks up his father, and finds him in Norma's room. Spying on Cliff and Norma talking, he assumes they are having an affair. Back home, Vinnie confides in Ellen about what he saw. Norma is invited to dinner with the family the next day, but the evening turns awkward as Vinnie and Ellen display open hostility towards Norma and refuse to speak to their father, while Ann, the most level-headed among the kids, privately chastises her boyfriend Vinnie for his immature behavior. Marion, however, seems oblivious to any suspicion and when Cliff angrily says that he has had enough of being treated like a wind-up robot, ready to serve everyone's needs, she soothes him with warmly comforting and gently dismissive words that his various overreactions are due to tiredness and misunderstanding, that too much excitement in life would be just that, too much, and then starts getting ready for bed. Cliff, frustrated and sleepless, gets up and leaves the bedroom to call Norma, asking her to meet him the next day, just as Vinnie comes in and overhears the key part of his father's conversation. During the dinner, Norma invites Marion and Ann to visit her design studio and, while there, Ann tries finding the right way to tell Norma that a rendez-vous with Cliff would cause unhappiness to the family, but Norma is sensitive enough to understand the import of Ann's meaning. After Marion and Ann leave, she calls off the meeting. Cliff, who can no longer control himself, goes to Norma's hotel and declares his love for her, but she tearfully asks him for time to think. In the meantime, Vinnie and Ellen go to Norma and begin with accusations, but as she points out their self-centered neglect of their father, they wind up pleading with her not to break up their parents' marriage. Ultimately, in another tearful confrontation with Cliff, Norma tells him that he would always regret abandoning his family and that she must leave alone. Cliff is left alone with his wind-up robot in his office as it goes back and forth on his desk. Later, back at the house, Vinnie reconciles with Ann, admitting that he was immature and selfish. Cliff looks longingly out a window as a plane carrying Norma flies overhead. In her seat on the plane, Norma has tears in her eyes, while Cliff is left to contemplate what is to become of his and Marion's marriage.

Released in November 1934, the film provided an infrequent leading role for character star Frank Morgan (five years before The Wizard of Oz), with Binnie Barnes as his old flame and Lois Wilson as his wife. Douglas Sirk originally wanted There's Always Tomorrow to shot in color, but Universal refused; the studio, however, did grant the director's request of having cinematographer Russell Metty work on the film. The scenes at the fictional Palm Valley Inn were filmed at the Apple Valley Inn. In this film MacMurray's character says to Stanwyck's: \\"After all these years ... it's certainly wonderful to see you again.\\", and she replies, \\"It's wonderful to see you too.\\"DVD soundtrack. MacMurray and Stanwyck had previously starred together in three other films: the Christmas romantic comedy trial film Remember the Night, a western film called The Moonlighter, and twelve years earlier, in the classic film noir Double Indemnity. Reception=Evaluation in film guides= Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide gives There's Always Tomorrow 2½ stars (out of 4) calling it a \\"sudsy but well-acted soap opera\\", while Steven H. Scheuer's Movies on TV ups the rating to a 3 star (out of 4) evaluation, describing it as a \\"mordant, intelligent soaper\\". TimeOut Film Guide's Paul Taylor goes further, stating that it is \\"a brilliant example of his [Sirk's] mastery of lacerating irony\\" and concluding that \\"her [Stanwyck's] generically-correct fairytale 'sacrifice' of self to the sanctity of the family, and the sanctioned role of the independent woman, merely intensifies the romantic agony of both dreamer victims. Tomorrow never comes.\\" Assigning 3½ stars (out of 5), The Motion Picture Guide describes it as \\"another of director Sirk's melodramatic, bitter attacks on the values of American middle-class life in the 1950s\\" and informs that Sirk's planned conclusion \\"was even darker than what appeared on the screen. The ending he filmed has MacMurray's [toy] robot [Rex] marching across a table top--making a final connection between his character and Rex. The original scenario had Rex reaching the edge of the desk and toppling to the ground. After crashing to the floor, the robot would struggle through a few final kicks before the end credits rolled.\\" In the write-up, Sirk's biographer, Michael Stern, quotes the director, \\"In tragedy the life always ends. By being dead, the hero is at the same time rescued from life's troubles. In melodrama, he lives on--in an unhappy happy end.\\" Home media availability Universal first released this film on DVD in 2010 as part of The Barbara Stanwyck Collection from its \\"Universal Backlot Series\\", a 3-disc set featuring five other films (Internes Can't Take Money, The Great Man's Lady, The Bride Wore Boots, The Lady Gambles, and All I Desire).https://www.amazon.com/Barbara-Stanwyck-Collection- Internes-Tomorrow/dp/B0037RBVLU The transfer of There's Always Tomorrow from this set was presented in an open matte 1.33:1 aspect ratio.

She had been built as a Design 1037 ship for the United States Shipping Board in World War I and had served in the United States Navy in that war as animal transport USS Liberty (ID-3461). She was also notable as the first ship constructed at Federal Shipbuilding, Kearny, New Jersey. In 1963 a volcanic eruption moved the ship off the beach, and Libertys wreck is now a popular dive site. World War I Liberty was launched on 19 June 1918 by the Federal Shipbuilding Company in Kearny, New Jersey, and acquired by the United States Navy on 7 October 1918 and commissioned the same day with Lieutenant Commander Charles Longbottom in command. Assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service, Liberty departed the New York Navy Yard on 24 October 1918, arriving at Brest, France, with her cargo of horses on 8 November. Over the next 6 months, Liberty made two additional cruises from New York to France discharging both animal and general cargo at French ports. Loaded with 436 tons of U.S. Army cargo and 2,072 tons of steel rails, Liberty arrived at Newport News, Virginia, on 30 April 1919 from her final cruise. She was decommissioned there on 7 May and was returned to the United States Shipping Board the same day. Between the wars On 20 October 1929, Liberty collided with the French tug at Le Havre, Seine Maritime, France. Dogue sank with the loss of two crew members. On 23 November 1933, Liberty collided with the American cargo ship in the Ambrose Channel. Ohioan was consequently beached near the West Bank Light. World War II By 1939, Liberty—although owned by the United States Maritime Commission (a successor to the USSB)—was employed by the Southgate-Nelson Corporation of Norfolk, Virginia. Southgate-Nelson was the operator of several packet lines, including the American Hampton Roads Line, the Yankee Line, and the Oriole Lines, but secondary sources do not indicate for which of these services Liberty sailed.Jordan, p. 418.

(see ref #4) At the time of the United States' entry into World War II in December 1941, USAT Liberty was in the Pacific.

On 11 January, Liberty was torpedoed by about southwest of the Lombok Strait, near position . US destroyer and Dutch destroyer took the damaged ship in tow attempting to reach Celukan bawang harbour at Singaraja, the Dutch port and administrative centre for the Lesser Sunda Islands, on the north coast of Bali. However she was taking too much water and so was beached on the eastern shore of Bali at Tulamben so that the cargo and fittings could be salvaged. In 1963 the tremors associated with the eruption of Mount Agung caused the vessel to slip off the beach, and she now lies on a sand slope in of water, providing one of the most popular dive sites off Bali. The wreck of USAT Liberty is often misidentified as was a Hog Islander built at the end of World War I, but survived World War II to be scrapped in Baltimore, Maryland, in November 1950. or identified by the misnomer, USS Liberty.

It was ruled by a branch of the House of Stolberg. Stolberg Castle The town of Stolberg was probably founded in the 12th century as a mining settlement. The Counts of Stolberg (Grafen zu Stolberg) probably derived from a branch of the counts of Hohnstein castle near Nordhausen in Thuringia. The castle of Stolberg was first mentioned in 1210 as Stalberg, then the seat of one count Henry originally from nearby Voigtstedt. It remained a property of the comital family until its expropriation in 1945. The Stolberg lands, which were located mostly east of the Harz, included Stolberg, Hayn, the lower County of Hohnstein (1417), as well as Kelbra and Heringen (1413/17), the two latter territories being ruled alongside the House of Schwarzburg. The Counts of Stolberg could significantly enlarge their territory when they inherited the County of Wernigerode in 1429, the County of Königstein in 1535, and the County of Rochefort in 1544. The Protestant Reformation was introduced into their territory in 1539. On 19 March 1548 the line was split between a Harz line (Stolberg-Stolberg) and a Rhenish line with the possessions in Rochefort (Stolberg-Rochefort) and Königstein im Taunus (Stolberg-Königstein).

The comital residence was at Wernigerode, now part of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. The county was ruled by a branch of the House of Stolberg from 1429 until its mediatization to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1806. Nevertheless, the county remained in existence - with one short interruption - until the dissolution of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1918.  History  The counts of Wernigerode had established themselves as relatively independent, aristocratic rulers in the Eastphalian lands north of the Harz range, rivalling with the comital House of Regenstein. For more than two centuries from the High Middle Ages, they ruled over extended estates stretching from the Oker river in the west to the glacial valley of the Großes Bruch. The male line finally died out in 1429. =Establishment= Wernigerode Castle, rebuilt in the 19th century In the early 12th century, one Count Adalbert from Haimar near Hanover, first mentioned in 1103 and named comes Adelbertus de villa Heymbere in 1117, appears on just one occasion as Adelbertus comes de Wernigerode, when he is listed as one of the witnesses to a document issued by Bishop Reinhard of Halberstadt on 18 October 1121. This first appearance of a Wernigerode count is also the first record of the clearing settlement of Wernigerode, whose beginnings, however, date roughly to a century earlier. Wernigerode Castle is first mentioned in 1213 as a castrum and served as the permanent residence of the subsequent Counts of Wernigerode. The counts of Wernigerode remained in possession of important property in the region between Hildesheim, Burgdorf and the Steinwedel Forest until the end of the 14th century. The extent of those estates has led to conjecture that the comital estate at the foot of the Harz in Wernigerode was even greater and more valuable still, encouraging the counts to abandon their old seat in Haimar and settle here. Nevertheless, estimates of the size and wealth of the comital estate are always hampered by the difficulty of being able to compare it with any suitable benchmark or population figures. Consequently, it is also probable, that the centres of power of Wernigerode and Haimar existed alongside one another. The family seat of Wernigerode was located in the middle of Imperial domains (Reichsgut),Albrecht Heine, Grundzüge der Verfassungsgeschichte des Harzgaues im XII. und XIII. Jahrhundert. Diss. Göttingen 1903, p. 49 f. and according to the preface of the Sachsenspiegel the counts of Wernigerode descended from Swabia.Anselm Heinrichsen, Süddeutsche Adelsgeschlechter in Niedersachsen im 11. und 12. Jahrhundert, Niedersächsisches Jahrbuch für Landesgeschichte 26 (1954), p. 24-116, here 86 ff. Since the Salian emperor, Henry IV, preferred to employ mainly free knights and ministeriales from Swabia to encounter the Saxon Revolts, a delegation of former vassals of his noble family appearing on the northern edge of the Harz seems to make sense.Heinrichsen, Süddeutsche Adelsgeschlechter, p. 86 ff.; Walther Grosse, Aus der Frühgeschichte der Grafschaft Wernigerode. Vom Ursprung der ersten Grafen von Wernigerode, Zeitschrift des Harzvereins für Geschichte und Alterthumskunde 68 (1935), p. 126-135. Furthermore, the counts of Wernigerode held the Steinberg estates near the Imperial domains of Goslar, on the spur of which Henry IV had tasked the Saxon count Otto of Nordheim, later his fiercest rival, to construct a castle. In view of the conflict between the emperor and Otto of Nordheim and the political superiority of the pro-imperial nobility at the Harz after Otto's death in 1083, there was a legal succession awarded to Count Adalbert I or to one of his ancestors, achieved by the allocation of estates, at the instigation of Henry IV.Jan Habermann, Verbündete Vasallen: Die Netzwerke von Grafen und Herren am Nordwestharz im Spannungsgefüge zwischen rivalisierenden Fürstgewalten (ca. 1250-1400). Norderstedt 2011, p. 43. Threatened by the neighbouring Welf dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg during the Great Interregnum, the Wernigerode counts lost Imperial immediacy as early as 1268, when they chose to become vassals of the Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg and, subsequently, of the Prince-archbishops of Magdeburg in 1381, after a protracted dispute about the former Imperial castle at Pabstorf. The counts had hoped that they would receive greater protection of the castle and town of Wernigerode against the overpowering pressure from their Brunswick neighbours, however, their expectations were not fulfilled in the long run. When they acquired further territories from the Counts of Regenstein in 1343, they held these fiefs as vassals of the Halberstadt bishops and the Wernigerode counts as well as their Stolberg successors were issued with separate deeds of enfeoffment for their estates until the transfer of the Halberstadt territories to the Brandenburg electors by the 1648 Peace of Westphalia. =House of Stolberg= Stolberg-Wernigerode coat of arms Count Henry of Wernigerode was the last male representative of the dynasty. He demanded from Archbishop Günther II of Magdeburg the enfeoffment of the castle and town of Wernigerode for himself and his two Stolberg cousins Henry and his brother Bodo the Elder, then ruling over the Thuringian County of Stolberg south of the Harz range. The inheritance was secured on 30 June 1414. As one of the heirs chosen by the last Wernigerode count, Henry of Stolberg, died young, Count Henry of Wernigerode in 1417 had the people of the county swear fealty to Count Bodo of Stolberg as the future owner of the lordship of Wernigerode. As Count Bodo had the fortune to become the sole Stolberg heir at that same time, it became necessary, however, for him to establish his permanent seat of power at Stolberg Castle. This was a setback for the further development of Wernigerode because, after the death of Count Henry of Wernigerode in 1429, no count resided permanently in the town. The demise of Wernigerode was reinforced by the fact that Count Bodo started in 1438, to pledge the castle and its associated lordship. It was a very lucrative fief that included the spiritual fiefdom of the Monastery of St. George and St. Sylvester at Wernigerode, the abbeys of Himmelpforten, Ilsenburg and Drübeck, and the villages of Drübeck, Reddeber, Langeln with its Teutonic Order, Wasserleben with its nunnery, and Veckenstedt with its important aristocratic seat (Adelshof). The lordship of Wernigerode was thus much more significant than that of the stem county of Stolberg which did not have a single monastery within its borders. The actual county reduced in size during the 16th century to the comital district (gräfliche Amt) of Wernigerode that, for example, had the following tax receipts (Schoss) in 1543/44: * Wernigerode Altstadt - 100 marks * Wernigerode Neustadt - 13 marks, 16 pieces * Drübeck - 30.5 marks * Wasserleben - 21.5 marks * Langeln - 22 marks * Silstedt - 5 marks * Ilsenburg - 2 marks * Darlingerode - 3 marks * For the abandoned village of Steinbruch near Drübeck - 4 Vierdung * Inheritance tax from Wernigerode, Veckenstedt, Silstedt, Langeln, Wasserleben and the chapter of St. Sylvester and George at Wernigerode etc. In toto the Amtmann of Wernigerode collected 5,120 guilders in 1543/44, compared with just 4,247 guelders the year before. Against that the expenditure for the district was 3,456 guelders, leaving a profit of 1,664 guelders. That was a considerable sum, if one considers that in that year a new minting workshop had been built for 50 guelders. For more than 200 years, both territories were ruled in personal union by the House of Stolberg. Held by the Stolberg-Stolberg line from 1548, the comital dynasty again divided their dominions when in 1710 Count Christian Ernest received the Stolberg- Wernigerode territory from the estate of his uncle Count Ernest of Stolberg. He relocated his residence to Wernigerode Castle which he had extensively restored. Nevertheless, in 1714 he had to acknowledge the overlordship of the Prussian Principality of Halberstadt. Finally mediatized, the county was incorporated into the Prussian Province of Saxony in 1815.

The screenplay is based on her novel of the same name. It features an ensemble cast including Robin Wright, Alan Arkin, Maria Bello, Monica Bellucci, Blake Lively, Julianne Moore, Keanu Reeves, and Winona Ryder. The film premiered on February 9, 2009, at the 59th Berlin International Film Festival and was shown at the Sydney Film Festival and the Edinburgh Film Festival before opening in the United Kingdom on July 10. Following a showing at the Toronto International Film Festival, it received a limited release in the United States on November 27, 2009.  Plot  The film chronicles the life of Pippa Lee (Robin Wright), with flashbacks to her tumultuous past. Pippa Sarkissian (Blake Lively) was the youngest child and only girl in her large Christian family. Her mother Suky (Maria Bello) was a neurotic mother with an obsessive fixation on her daughter's looks. By her teen years, Pippa discovers that her mother takes amphetamines to self- medicate vast mood swings. She has a confrontation with her mother by taking drugs and Pippa moves to her aunt and roommate, who are in a lesbian menage. The aunt discovers Pippa participating in erotic photo sessions with the roommate and her friends; Pippa is banished again and goes on to live a bohemian life of drugs and work as an exotic dancer. On a weekend jaunt with like-minded friends, she meets a charismatic publisher named Herb Lee who is 30 years older than her and a romance develops between them. The couple marry, have two children and later move into a retirement home in Connecticut. Through her marriage, Pippa has become the \\"perfect wife\\", loving, supportive, everything to everyone and no-one to herself. The couple grow apart; Herb has an affair with one of Pippa's friends and middle-aged Pippa has encounters with a younger man named Chris. After Herb dies from a heart attack, Pippa breaks with her life of subservience and refuses to set up the burial, leaving the details to her children. The film ends with Pippa driving off with Chris.  Cast  * Robin Wright as Pippa Lee * Blake Lively as Young Pippa * Alan Arkin as Herb Lee * Keanu Reeves as Chris Nadeau * Maria Bello as Suky Sarkissian * Zoe Kazan as Grace Lee * Winona Ryder as Sandra Dulles * Mike Binder as Sam Shapiro * Monica Bellucci as Gigi Lee * Ryan McDonald as Ben Lee * Julianne Moore as Kat * Shirley Knight as Dot * Robin Weigert as Trish  Production  The film was shot on location in Danbury, New Milford, Stamford, Newtown, Southbury and Derby, Connecticut.  Critical response  On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 69% based on 75 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads: \\"Reverential and offbeat, the road trip film Private lives of Pippa Lee takes emotional detours and is elevated by great performances, particularly that of Robin Wright-Penn.\\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 49% based on 16 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". David Gritten of The Telegraph observed: \\"Buttressed by a formidable cast . . . Miller navigates her story between sharp satire, dark comedy and wrenching drama. Pippa feels like a character from films of an earlier vintage, including Diary of a Mad Housewife and The Graduate; however she is less of a rebel than \\"Housewife's\\" protagonist and more non-conformist than Mrs. Robinson. Hints and traces of a playful, late 1960s mood abound. Yet Miller's film is a triumph. Uniformly well acted, it boasts a psychologically knowing script, clearly written by a smart, assertive human being rather than a software programme.\\" Philip French of The Observer said, \\"The humour is forced, the shocking revelations too sudden and not altogether convincing, but it's enjoyable in an uninvolving way.\\" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian rated the film two out of five stars, calling it a \\"hugely overegged pudding of a film,\\" \\"indulgent,\\" \\"complacent,\\" and \\"a film that is very pleased with itself.\\" Trevor Johnston of Time Out London rated the film three out of five stars and commented: \\"No challenge to surmise where all this is heading, but there are pleasures to be had while it takes the scenic route. With the story structure working backwards and forwards at the same time, the lack of tension is no surprise, nor does Miller help herself by flitting through a variety of moods, from period satire, whimsical imagining and character comedy to more sinewy drama. On a scene-by-scene basis, though, it's classily effective, mainly because of Wright Penn's skill in nailing the precise tenor of every moment. She's a great actress, and a subtle one, too. Anyone who can wrestle scenes away from a lovably grouchy Alan Arkin must be on top of their game.\\" Hannah Forbes Black from Channel 4 rated the film 2½ out of five stars, calling it a \\"soft-focus, chocolate-box fairytale.\\" She continued: \\"The whole thing is vaguely reminiscent of post-war domestic dramas aimed at a daytime audience of housewives – like a photo-negative of Brief Encounter ... Miller's self-adapted script is no more strained and compromised than the average book- to-film adaptation, but one wishes that she'd seized this amazing opportunity to take liberties with her own work ... Toured rapidly around Pippa's life, we can see the outline of the traumas and choices that have shaped her personality, but the film doesn't seem to know what it wants to say about any of it.\\"Channel 4 review Darren Amner of Eye For Film rated it three out of five stars and called the script \\"very wry, funny and emotionally charged.\\" Peter Brunette of The Hollywood Reporter called it \\"the kind of film that most critics desperately want to like\\" and added: > \\"Unfortunately, writer-director Rebecca Miller's script tries so hard to be > nervous and edgy that it ultimately succeeds only in making its viewers > nervous and edgy. It's as though Miller threw a really loud party for all > her Hollywood friends, but forgot to invite the audience ... The acting is > top-notch (if consistently over-the-top) and the direction is perky (not to > say frenzied), but the script is just immensely too much of a good thing. > Virtually every character in the film, and virtually everything they say, is > so self-consciously quirky that viewers quickly start wincing when they > should be laughing or crying ... The film's basic structure is to alternate > between Pippa's present-day life as a suburban Mom and her wild youth, but > the transitions are often awkward and the polar opposite moods of each part > tend to work against rather than reinforce each other. The ultimate intent > of the film seems to be to make some honest points about seeking one's own > happiness rather than living for the sake of others, but it also wants to be > outrageous and outrageously funny at the same time, and the clash of tones > is fatal.\\" Alissa Simon of Variety noted: \\"Cardboard characters and severe problems of tone fatally flaw the awkward satirical relationship drama [that] feels as schizophrenic as its eponymous heroine ... While the film marks a change of pace from the intense seriousness of Miller's earlier work, she never finds the dark comic edge that would make Pippa more satisfying viewing. Indeed, she never sustains any tone at all. The dialogue teeters from flat comedy to wince-worthy whimsy, with detours through blithe and earnest. Visual style, too, is all over the place ... Period music does a better job of evoking the era than the laughable costumes, hair and makeup.\\"  References  External links  * 2009 films 2009 romantic comedy-drama films American films American romantic comedy-drama films Films about drugs Films about runaways Films based on American novels Films based on romance novels Films directed by Rebecca Miller Films set in Connecticut Films set in New York City Films shot in Connecticut Plan B Entertainment films 2009 comedy films 2009 drama films ","title":"The Private Lives of Pippa Lee"},{"id":"18599475","text":"Ultamatix was a tool that automates the addition of applications, codecs, fonts and libraries not provided directly by the software repositories of Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu.

The album was re-issued in 1977 as The Early Years, re-issued once more on Compact disc in 1991, and was re-released again in December 2017 in both Remastered, 180 Gram Vinyl and CD formats. History Columbia Records, recognising Harper's potential, hired American producer Shel Talmy to produce the album. Talmy later claimed that 'Harper was difficult... truculent... we battled. But we got round to it'. Musically, the album was notable for the 11-minute track \\"Circle\\" comprising several movements, \\"a soundscape of Harper's difficult youth\\" that, according to Harper, was \\"totally unlike anything anyone else was doing. The Beatles weren’t doing anything like that at the time. The Stones weren’t doing anything like it, either. No-one was\\" Career-wise, the album was notable for establishing a broadening in Harper's musical style away from the more traditional side of contemporary folk music then played. Harper had an interest in traditional folk but did not consider himself a Bona fide member of the folk scene. He later explained:- Harper's record company had different expectations. \\"They wanted me to write commercial pop songs and when they heard the album...they didn’t have a clue. They wanted hits. And I gave them \\"Circle\\"\\". Bert Jansch contributed sleeve notes for the album. During this period, Harper was managed by American music entrepreneur Jo Lustig; manager of The Pentangle and former agent to Julie Felix. Re-releases In 1977 the album was re-issued by CBS with different cover art under the title The Early Years. In 1991 the album was re-released again by Awareness Records with new artwork and additional content. The 2017 remastered album removed those 1991 bonus tracks, reverting to the original 1968 tracklist.

The February 26 attacks were followed by similar bloody attacks on other Wiyot villages later that week.

They had never fought with white settlers and were not expecting an attack.Indian Island Tuluwat The killings followed two years of open hostility by a group of local whites against the residents of Indian Island, numerous editorials in the local newspapers, and the formation of volunteer militia groups. A pattern of hostility had developed between local Indians and the settlers, who let their cattle stray onto Indian lands. Indians utilized the cattle, but the cattle owners struck back in retaliation. On the night of 26 February 1860, a small group of settlers crossed Humboldt Bay and to avoid drawing attention from nearby Eureka residents, many of whom may not have condoned the killings, carried out the attack primarily with hatchets, clubs and knives. Contrary to a commonly held view, guns were also used, with some Eureka residents reported hearing shots that night, but knowledge of the attack was not widespread at the time. News accounts report only the shooting of adult men, with handheld weapons used against women and children. =Deaths= Based upon Wiyot Tribe estimates, 80 to 250 Wiyot people were murdered. Another estimate states the number of American Indian people killed at 150. Because most of the adult able-bodied men were away gathering supplies as part of continuing preparation for the World Renewal Ceremony, nearly all the Wiyot men murdered are believed to have been older men, which is one reason why the Wiyot were largely defenseless. It is untrue to say the Wiyot were killed with ease because they were \\"exhausted from the annual celebration.\\" The celebration usually lasted seven to ten days, and the men traditionally left at night for the supplies while the elders, women and children slept. That is why most victims were children, women and older men. Arcata's local newspaper, the Northern Californian, described the scene as follows: > Blood stood in pools on all sides; the walls of the huts were stained and > the grass colored red. Lying around were dead bodies of both sexes and all > ages from the old man to the infant at the breast. Some had their heads > split in twain by axes, others beaten into jelly with clubs, others pierced > or cut to pieces with bowie knives. Some struck down as they mired; others > had almost reached the water when overtaken and butchered. =Survivors= There were few survivors. One woman, Jane Sam, survived by hiding in a trash pile. Two cousins, Matilda and Nancy Spear, hid with their three children on the west side of the island and later found seven other children still alive. A young boy, Jerry James, was found alive in his dead mother's arms. Polly Steve was badly wounded and left for dead, but recovered. One of the few Wiyot men on the island during the attack, Mad River Billy, jumped into the bay and swam to safety in Eureka. Another woman, Kaiquaish (also known as Josephine Beach) and her eleven-month-old son William survived by not being on the island in the first place. Kaiquaish had set out in a canoe with her son to take part in the ceremonies, but became lost in the fog and was forced to return home before the attacks began. =Coordinated attacks= The Tuluwat/Indian Island massacre was part of a coordinated simultaneous attack that targeted other nearby Wiyot sites, including an encampment on the Eel River. The same day the same party was reported to have killed 58 more people at South Beach, about south of Eureka even though many of the women worked for the white families and many could speak \\"good English.\\" On 28 February 1860, 40 more Wiyot were killed on the South Fork of the Eel River, and 35 more at Eagle Prairie a few days later. Though the attack was widely condemned in newspapers outside Humboldt County, no one was ever prosecuted for the murders. Bret Harte, wrote an editorial from Uniontown (now Arcata, California) against the massacre and would soon need to leave the area due to the threats against his life. In the editorial, Harte wrote: > [A] more shocking and revolting spectacle was never exhibited to the eyes of > a Christian and civilized people. Old women, wrinkled and decrepit, lay > weltering in blood, their brains dashed out and dabbled with their long gray > hair. Infants scarce a span long, with their faces cloven with hatchets and > their bodies ghastly with wounds.\\" Several prominent local citizens also wrote letters to the San Francisco papers angrily condemning the attacks and naming suspected conspirators. =Investigation= The local sheriff, Barrant Van Ness, stated in a newspaper editorial published in the San Francisco Bulletin a few days after the massacre that the motive was revenge for cattle rustling. Ranchers in the inland valleys claimed as much as one-eighth of their cattle had been stolen or slaughtered by Indians over the previous year and one rancher, James C. Ellison, was killed while pursuing suspected rustlers in May 1859. However, the area where the ranches were located was occupied by the Nongatl tribe, not the Wiyot, so the victims of the massacre would not have been responsible for any rustling. Van Ness closed his written statement by saying he did not excuse the killers for their deeds. Major Gabriel J. Rains, Commanding Officer of Fort Humboldt at the time, reported to his commanding officer that a local group of vigilantes had resolved to \\"kill every peaceable Indian - man, woman, and child.\\" The vigilantes, calling themselves the Humboldt Volunteers, Second Brigade, had been formed in early February 1860 in the inland town of Hydesville, one of the ranching communities in the Nongatl area. They spent most of February \\"in the field\\" attacking Indians along the Eel River. A petition had been sent to California Governor John G. Downey asking that the Humboldt Volunteers be mustered into service and given regular pay. Downey declined the petition, stating that the U.S. Army was sending an additional Company of Regulars to Fort Humboldt. A review of subsequent communications to Governor Downey revealed the true motive for the series of massacres that included Indian Island. The volunteer company led by Seman Wright wanted to become officially recognized as state militia, thereby becoming eligible for state funding. Hydesville rancher E. L. Daivs, who had presided at the meeting where the company was formed, wrote Downey just after the massacre, stating that \\"This company is needed for the protection of lives & property & if we do not get it we will never ask the state again & I for one shall oppose paying any more state Taxes & [we will] fight our own battles in our own way-- exterminate the Indians from the face of the earth as far as this county is concerned. In fact, the little mess at Indian Island is only a beginning if we can't get our just protection from [the] state or [federal] government that the citizens are entitled to.\\"E. L. Davis, letter to Governor Downey, April 3, 1860, Indian War Papers, folder F3753:568. =Consequences= The Wiyot Tribe said their people were not allowed to return to the island or their other land and they often found their land stolen or destroyed. Soldiers from Fort Humboldt took many of the surviving Wiyot into protective custody at the fort, later transporting them to the Klamath River Reservation. However, the Indians did not leave their former home without any resistance. In fact, many Wiyots returned home shortly after arriving at the Fort and attacks on white settlements were stronger in areas with sparse settlement of whites. Recently the Wiyot have been repurchasing the land in order to perform their annual World Renewal Ceremony. See also * Wiyot Tribe * Henry P.

In Canada, Internet service providers (ISPs) generally provide Internet service in a neutral manner. Some notable incidents otherwise have included Bell Canada's throttling of certain protocols and Telus's censorship of a specific website critical of the company.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/telus-cuts-subscriber-access-to-pro- union-website-1.531166 However, the telecommunications concept currently is explicitly enforced by Canada's federal telecommunications regulatory body, The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), with the open support of the current federal government under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. History  In Canada, under the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1993, internet providers are considered utilities which are subject to regulations which in spirit predate later debates about net neutrality that state that service providers can't give \\"undue or unreasonable preference,\\" nor can they influence the content being transmitted over their networks. Furthermore, the CRTC, unlike the more directly political appointees of the American Federal Communications Commission (FCC), is a more arms-length regulatory body with more autonomous authority over telecommunications. For example, the CRTC's decisions rely more on a more judiciary process relying on evidence submitted during public consultations, rather than along party lines as the American FCC is prone to do. In 2005, when Telus blocked access to labour union blogs during an employee strike, the question of net neutrality became more prominent. In March 2006, the then Conservative government led by then Industry Minister Maxime Bernier updated the Telecommunications Policy Objectives and Regulation with new objectives to focus on three broad goals: * Promoting affordable access to advanced telecommunications services in all regions of Canada, including urban, rural, and remote areas * Enhancing the efficiency of Canadian telecommunications markets and the productivity of the Canadian economy * Enhancing the social well-being of Canadians and the inclusiveness of Canadian society by meeting the needs of the disabled, enhancing public safety and security, protecting personal privacy and limiting public nuisance through telecommunications networks. On February 7, 2007, The Canadian Press obtain documents where the Conservative government is reluctant to implement Net neutrality legislation. However, Bernier and his advisers, despite acknowledging the arguments made by telecom companies, stated that \\"it would be premature at this time to draw any conclusions.\\" The documents point to statements like public policy must consider consumer protection and choice, but it should also \\"enable market forces to continue to shape the evolution of the Internet infrastructure, investment and innovation to the greatest extent feasible. On May 28, 2008, the federal New Democratic Party (NDP) introduced a private member's bill, C-552, to the House of Commons that would explicitly entrench the principle of \\"net neutrality\\" and enact rules to keep the Internet free from interference by service providers. This bill died on the order paper at 1st reading on September 7, 2008, when Prime Minister Stephen Harper asked the Governor General for the dissolution of the 39th Session of Parliament. On June 8, 2008, a private member's bill, C-555, entitled \\"The Telecommunications Clarity and Fairness Act\\" was introduced by Liberal MP David McGuinty (Ottawa–South) that sought to undertake, among other things, \\"an assessment of network management practices that favour, degrade or prioritize any packet transmitted over a broadband network based on source, ownership or destination\\". Like the NDP bill, this proposed legislation fell after the 39th Parliament was dissolved by the Governor General. In November 2008, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) scheduled a review of the Internet traffic management of ISPs and is still in the review process. The CRTC took comments from the public until Monday, February 23, 2009. In May 2009 An Act to amend the Telecommunications Act (Internet neutrality) was introduced during the second session of the 40th Parliament to ensure net neutrality. This act (Bill C-398) did not become law. On January 25, 2011, the CRTC ruled that usage-based billing could now be introduced. Prime Minister Harper signalled that the government may be looking into such a ruling: \\"We're very concerned about CRTC's decision on usage-based billing and its impact on consumers. I've asked for a review of the decision\\". Some have suggested that this adversely affects net neutrality, since it discriminates against media that is larger in size, such as audio and video. The new ruling significantly throttles the availability of access by small business owners as they would have to pay for services. In April 2017, the CRTC took a series of decisions to support net neutrality but also allow ISP's to offer differential pricing to customers, but only in the areas of speed rates, monthly data usage etc. but not based on content. On November 22, 2017, in an interview with Vice Motherboard, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressed concern when the FCC in the United States proposed decreasing regulations concerning net neutrality. He stated that \\"Net neutrality is something that is essential for small businesses, for consumers, and it is essential to keep the freedom associated with the internet alive.\\" On December 14, 2017, Navdeep Bains, Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development concurred with that policy stating, \\"We believe that an open and accessible Internet is vital to the free flow of content and information, which, in turn, is vital to our democracy. Freedom, equality, diversity and openness are important values for our government, and we firmly intend to uphold these values.\\" Cases of net neutrality violation=Telus vs. Telecommunications Workers Union= In July 2005, while its union workers were locked out, Telus blocked its subscribers access to Voices for Change, which was a community website run by and for Telecommunications Workers Union members. Telus claimed the site suggested striking workers jam Telus phone lines and that it posted pictures of employees crossing the union picket lines. A Telus spokesperson said advocating jamming lines hurt the company, and access to those pictures threatened the privacy and safety of employees. Telus said in a news release that it had reached an agreement with the operator of Voices for Change to allow re-enabled access to the website. The agreement included the removal of all content, including photographs, posted with the intent of intimidation. =Bell Canada traffic shaping= On April 3, 2008, the Canadian Association of Internet Providers requested that the CRTC require Bell Canada to immediately cease its traffic shaping and Internet traffic throttling. On November 20, 2008, the CRTC ruled that Bell Canada's traffic shaping was not discriminatory because it was applied to both wholesale and retail customers. The CRTC also called for public hearings to ensure that network management practices are administered fairly in the future. = Xplornet throttling complaints = In 2014, Xplornet faced 12 complaints over the use of throttling technologies. However, the CRTC decided not to impose penalties due to the fact that Xplornet had disclosed its policies before pledging to fix the problem. = Videotron's unlimited music service= In April 2017, the CRTC announced a ruling that required all data to be counted against a user's data cap, regardless of its source. The decision was made necessary by the introduction by Videotron of a cellular data plan that didn't count against the user's data cap any use of a \\"music over streaming\\" service in a restricted list of services (like Apple Music, Spotify and others). The rationale behind the decision was that the plan would give an unfair advantage to the services allowed on the list and would disadvantage small services that would want to enter the marketplace. The chairman of the CRTC, Jean-Pierre Blais, said at the time that \\"the aim [of] the decision was to encourage Internet service providers to compete on price, speed and network quality instead of acting as a gatekeeper.\\"  Opinion on legislation  In 2007, Bell Canada spokeswoman Jacqueline Michelis in an e-mail to The Canadian Press argued that introducing net neutrality legislation was not necessary by stating \\"Our position on network diversity/neutrality is that it should be determined by market forces, not regulation.\\" On June 18, 2009, the Conservative Party of Canada was non- committal on the issue, arguing that free market competition is preferable to regulation. TekSavvy, Velcom, Acanac Inc. argue that throttling by Bell Canada at the ISP level makes it difficult to differentiate their services against Bell Canada, concerning issues about Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) and security, and the quality of service. According to TekSavvy, Bell Canada's congestion report to the CRTC shows that the “data suggests no congestion problems for at least 95 percent of the network in Ontario and Quebec.” Wholesale ISPs do not throttle bandwidth, but since wholesalers do not have a full network infrastructure, they rely on Bell Canada's network for the last stretch of cabling to customers. When Bell Canada receives packets on the network, it may be throttled, slowing down the connection between the wholesale ISP and the customer. TekSavvy and Velcom support MLPPP which circumvents Bell Canada's throttling. Yahoo! and Microsoft argue that net neutrality law is necessary because without such a law, ISPs will destroy the free and open nature of the Internet and also create a tiered, dollar-driven net that favours the wealthiest corporations over everyone else. Rogers Communications Inc. supports Canada net neutrality framework. Michael Geist has been writing about net neutrality in the Toronto Star. When he had an interview with CARTT.CA, he said that \\"from a policy and law perspective, we ought to be thinking about what kind of rules the government might consider to help facilitate some of that.\\" Geist has used the Xplornet throttling complaints to indicate how Canada's current net neutrality framework does not uphold its principles. However, Ken Engelhart writing about net neutrality in the Financial Post argues that Canada's net neutrality framework can lead to over-regulation which can limit consumer choice. Montreal Economic Institute: an op-ed published in the Morning Consult by a couple of staff members—former policy advisers to then Industry minister Maxime Bernier—argues in favor of net neutrality principles. However they favor a more \\"light touch regulatory regime that that can adapt to new business models and technological change \\" instead of \\"\\"strict preventive rules\\" when enforcing it. In addition, both of them feel like both sides are misinterpreting the debate about net neutrality While Marcel Boyer, in a 2009 article argued that net neutrality should be handled by anti-trust enforcement agencies such as the Canadian Competition Bureau instead of the CRTC.

The film is the second in a trilogy produced during the Golden Age of Mexican cinema, starting with Nosotros los Pobres (We the Poor) earlier in 1948 and followed by Pepe the Bull (Pepe, el toro) in 1953. Ismael Rodríguez directed all three films, with Pedro Infante as Pepe the Bull and Evita Muñoz as his daughter Chachita, while Blanca Estela Pavón only appeared as Celia in the first two, as she died in a plane crash in 1949. Synopsis A carpenter named Pepe el Toro is in a car accident and Pepe gets into a fight with the passenger, which draws a crowd and the attention of the police. Afterwards Pepe tells Celia that the man he fought with is Chachita's birthfather, Manuel. Later, the father of Chachita and his mother goes to Chachita's house to talk to her to give her a better life. They want to Chachita to live with them so they can leave poverty, but she is not getting along with the rich comments over the poverty and also she is making friends with El Atarantado, a silly but loyal boy from the vicinity. In the other side, Pepe get some jobs and soon is being pulled apart from his family by one of his old friends in jail, who is making him becoming closer to Ledo \\"El Tuerto\\" who has escaped from jail and wants to take revenge of losing his eye. Finally Chachita decides that she wants to go home and leave her birth family, her birth father, surprised that Chachita's wants to leave and go back to poverty. When El Camello, a hunchback Lottery vendor learns that Lido is free and tries to tell Pepe, but is discovered by Lido's henchmen and throw him onto the tramway rails just at the moment the tramway passes over his legs losing them in the process. In his agony he sees Pepe but he does not live enough to warn him about the impending danger to his family and friends. All the adults in the vicinity brings El Camello body to be buried, while this is happening, Lido set fire on Pepe's carpentry where Chachita and Emilio Giron, El Torito are trapped, Chachita's father saves her life but he dies in the process while Emilio Giron, el Torito is trapped in the fire. Pepe arrives too late to save his baby that is horribly burned to death. Some days later, Chachita goes to his grandmother home to seek counsel from her, but she finds her also alone, because she finds that no one is really paying respects to her son and only wants to wait more money. In Pepe's house, he is crying over his dead son remembering all the happy moments that he shared with him, finally he went out to leave his kid with La Chorreada. Just moments later, his friend makes him know about the guilty of the fire and guides him to the Energy Company building where he is confronted by Lido El Tuerto and his henchmen, a fight begins with Lido shooting at Pepe but he only hits him in an ear, then the fist fight turns to Lido's side, until one of his allies dies electrocuted when failing in a high voltage room. The fight continues and Lido and his partner is getting Pepe to the board of the roof, but Pepe is able to pull both Lido and his partner to make them fall to their death. Some time later, a meeting is done to celebrate the new born kid of Pepe and La Chorreada. Chachita's grandmother decides to live with them as long as she learned her lesson that money does not bring love and everyone is happy again.

The expansion era of the National Hockey League (NHL) began when six new teams were added for the 1967–68 season, ending the Original Six era. The six existing teams were grouped into the newly created East Division, and the expansion teams—the Los Angeles Kings, Minnesota North Stars, Oakland Seals, Philadelphia Flyers, Pittsburgh Penguins and St. Louis Blues—formed the West Division. The NHL added another six teams by 1974 to bring the league to 18 teams. This continued expansion was partially brought about by the creation of the World Hockey Association (WHA), which operated from 1972 until 1979 and sought to compete with the NHL for markets and players. Bobby Hull was the most famous player to defect to the rival league, signing a $2.75 million contract with the Winnipeg Jets. When the WHA ceased operations in 1979, the NHL absorbed four of the league's teams—the Edmonton Oilers, Hartford Whalers, Quebec Nordiques and Winnipeg Jets. This brought the NHL to 21 teams (the Cleveland Barons had ceased operations in 1978), a figure that remained constant until the San Jose Sharks joined as an expansion franchise in 1991. The NHL became involved in international play, starting with the Summit Series in 1972, which pitted the top Canadian players of the NHL against the top players of the Soviet Union. Canada won the eight-game series four wins to three with one tie. The success of the series led to the creation of the Canada Cup, held five times between 1976 and 1991. NHL teams also faced Soviet League teams that toured North America between 1975 and 1991 in what was known as the Super Series. The fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989 saw many former Soviet-Bloc players stream into the NHL, joining several players who had defected in the 1980s. This was the highest scoring period in NHL history. It was led in the 1980s by the Edmonton Oilers and Wayne Gretzky, who scored 200 points or more four times, including a current league-record 215 in 1985–86. Gretzky's 92 goals in 1981–82 also remains a league record. No other player in NHL history has scored 200 points, although Mario Lemieux came close in 1988–89 with 199.  Background  Expansion had been a major topic of discussion among NHL owners since 1963, when William M. Jennings of the New York Rangers proposed adding two new teams on the West Coast to counter fears that the Western Hockey League intended to compete as a major league. After several years of discussion, the NHL announced in February 1966 that it would expand by six teams, doubling the league's size. The Los Angeles Kings, Minnesota North Stars, California Seals, Philadelphia Flyers, Pittsburgh Penguins and St. Louis Blues began play in the 1967–68 season. They formed the newly created West Division, and the existing teams were grouped into the East Division. The playoff format was constructed so that an established team would face an expansion team in the Stanley Cup Finals. The Clarence S. Campbell Bowl was created in honour of league president Clarence Campbell, and was awarded to the West Division champion. The new teams were stocked by the NHL's first expansion draft, as each team selected 20 players from the existing franchises. There was much debate over how many players each existing team could protect: the strongest clubs wished to protect more players, while the weaker clubs hoped that protecting fewer players would help improve the balance of competition. Montreal Canadiens manager Sam Pollock's suggestion to allow each team to protect eleven players to start, then add an additional player to their protected list for each player selected in the draft, was ultimately agreed to as a compromise solution. In addition, an \\"intra-league draft\\" was held following the 1968 and 1969 seasons to help accelerate the improvement of the expansion teams. Each team protected two goaltenders and fourteen skaters, leaving their remaining players open to be selected by any other team. Some teams created instant farm systems by buying existing minor league franchises. The Kings bought the Springfield Indians of the American Hockey League the night before the expansion draft, leading the Flyers to purchase the Quebec Aces. Expansion also changed how the amateur draft was handled. The old system, in which franchises sponsored junior teams and players, was abandoned by 1969 when all junior-aged players were made eligible for the entry draft.  Expansion years  In their inaugural season, the Flyers finished atop the West Division, recording 73 points in 74 games. The California Seals, a pre-season favourite to win the division, changed their name to the Oakland Seals a month into the season. The team disappointed both on the ice and at the gate, finishing last in the NHL with 14 wins. The Blues defeated the Flyers and North Stars to become the first expansion team to play for the Stanley Cup, where they were defeated in four consecutive games by the Canadiens. The Blues reached the finals again in both 1969 and 1970, but were similarly swept in both years, losing to the Canadiens and Boston Bruins, respectively. On January 13, 1968, North Stars' rookie Bill Masterton became the first and, to date, only player to die as a result of injuries suffered during an NHL game. Early in a game against the Seals, Masterton was checked hard by two players, Ron Harris and Larry Cahan, causing him to flip over backwards and land on his head. He was rushed to hospital with massive head injuries, and died there two days later. The National Hockey League Writers Association presented the league with the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy later in the season; the trophy is awarded annually to the player who best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey. Following Masterton's death, players slowly began wearing helmets; starting in the 1979–80 season, the league mandated that all players entering the league wear them. = Bobby Orr = Bobby Orr in the process of being tripped, scores the Stanley Cup winning Goal. Notice the puck in the net and the goal light has not yet come on. Bobby Orr flies through the air after scoring the Stanley Cup winning goal, May 10, 1970. In the 1968–69 season, second-year defenceman Bobby Orr scored 21 goals, an NHL record for a defenceman, en route to winning his first of eight consecutive Norris Trophies as the league's top defenceman. At the same time, Orr's teammate, Phil Esposito, became the first player in league history to score 100 points in a season, finishing with 126 points. He was one of three players to break the century mark that year, including Bobby Hull and 41-year- old Gordie Howe. A gifted scorer, Orr revolutionized defencemen's impact on the offensive side of the game, as blue-liners began to be judged on how well they created goals in addition to how well they prevented them. Orr scored the Stanley-Cup-winning goal in overtime of the fourth game against the Blues in 1970, which gave the Bruins their first championship in 29 years. The goal was highlighted by his famous flight through the air after being tripped up following his shot. Orr twice won the Art Ross Trophy as the NHL's leading scorer, still the only defenceman in NHL history to do so. His plus/minus of +124 in 1970–71 is a league record. Orr signed a five-year contract that paid him $200,000 per season in 1971, the first $1 million contract in league history. Chronic knee problems plagued Orr throughout his career. In 1972, he tore ligaments in his left knee after a hard hit, leading to the first of six knee operations. He played 12 seasons in the NHL before injuries forced his retirement in 1978. Orr finished with 270 goals and 915 points in 657 games and won the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's Most Valuable Player three times. The customary three-year post-retirement waiting period for entry into the Hockey Hall of Fame was waived as he was enshrined in 1979. = Buffalo and Vancouver = In Canada, there was widespread outrage over the denial of an expansion team to Vancouver in 1967. Three years later, the NHL added a third Canadian team when the Vancouver Canucks, formerly of the Western Hockey League, were admitted as an expansion team for the 1970–71 season, along with the Buffalo Sabres, another team whose owners had bid unsuccessfully for an expansion team in 1967. The Canucks were placed in the East Division, despite being on the west coast, while the Chicago Black Hawks were shifted to the West in an attempt to equalize the divisions' strength. The league also gave the Sabres and Canucks the first two picks in each round of the 1970 NHL Amateur Draft, offering them a better opportunity to build their rosters than the 1967 expansion teams had. Buffalo's first round pick was Gilbert Perreault, a future Hall of Famer who would play seventeen seasons in Buffalo. Before the 1971–72 season, Gordie Howe and Jean Beliveau announced their retirements. Beliveau finished his 18-year career with 10 Stanley Cups, 2 Hart Trophies and 1,219 career points; his points total was the second-highest in NHL history. After playing 25 seasons in the NHL, Howe retired as the league's all-time leader in games played, goals, assists and points. Howe was a six- time league scoring champion, and also won six Hart Trophies. Both players had the customary three-year waiting period waived for entry into the Hockey Hall of Fame in acknowledgement of their achievements.  World Hockey Association  In 1972, the NHL faced competition from the newly formed World Hockey Association (WHA). The WHA lured many players away from the NHL, including Derek Sanderson, J. C. Tremblay and Ted Green. The WHA's biggest coup was to lure Bobby Hull from the Black Hawks to play for the Winnipeg Jets. Hull signed a 10-year deal: five years as a player for $250,000 per season, and five more for $100,000 per season in a front-office position. It also included a $1 million signing bonus. The deal totaled $2.7 million, and lent instant credibility to the new league. After Hull signed, several other players quickly followed suit. Bernie Parent, Gerry Cheevers, Johnny McKenzie and Rick Ley jumped to the WHA as the NHL suddenly found itself in a war for talent. By the time the 1972–73 WHA season began, 67 players had switched from the NHL to the WHA. Defections continued following the season, and the WHA scored another major coup when it signed Gordie Howe's sons Mark and Marty. The league then convinced Gordie to come out of retirement to play with them on the Houston Aeros. The NHL tried to block several of the defections. The Bruins attempted to restrain Cheevers and Sanderson from joining the WHA, though a United States federal court refused to prohibit the signings. The Black Hawks were successful in having a restraining order filed against Hull and the Jets pending the outcome of legal action the Black Hawks were taking against the WHA. The WHA was eager for the court action, intending to challenge the legality of the reserve clause, which bound a player to their NHL team until that team released him. In November 1972, a Philadelphia district court placed an injunction against the NHL, preventing it from enforcing the reserve clause and freeing all players who had restraining orders against them, including Hull, to play with their WHA clubs. The decision effectively ended the NHL's monopoly on major league professional hockey talent. The NHL also found itself competing with the WHA for markets. Initially, the league had no intention to expand past 14 teams, but the threat the WHA posed changed this. Hoping to keep the WHA out of the newly completed Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, New York and the Omni Coliseum in Atlanta, Georgia, the league hastily announced the creation of the New York Islanders and Atlanta Flames as 1972 expansion teams. Following the 1972–73 season, the NHL announced it was further expanding to 18 teams for the 1974–75 season, adding the Kansas City Scouts and Washington Capitals., which marked the end of the league's first major expansion period. In just eight years, the NHL had tripled in size to 18 teams.  Summit Series  Frank Lennon's award-winning photograph of Cournoyer (12) and Henderson's celebration became the defining image of the Summit Series, and has been reproduced in books, stamps and coins. Internationally, Canada had long been protesting the Soviet Union's use of \\"professional amateurs\\" at the World Championships and the Olympic Games, which were amateur events. Canada withdrew from international competition in 1969 and boycotted the 1972 Olympic hockey tournament. As an alternative, NHL Players' Association executive director Alan Eagleson negotiated a deal with Soviet authorities to hold an eight-game series between the Soviet national team and Canada's top professionals. The tournament was the NHL's response to the defection of players to the WHA. Bobby Hull was barred from playing, as was any other player who signed a contract with the rival league, which was a heavily criticized move. Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau sent a telegram to NHL president Clarence Campbell, expressing his \\"intense interest which I share with millions of Canadians ... that Canada should be represented by its best hockey players, including Bobby Hull\\". Echoing the feelings of the public, Hull called the decision \\"crazy\\", and stated that \\"I'm a Canadian and I want to play for my country. I don't know why the NHL has to be so petty over this. I want to do this for Canada.\\" The NHL did not relent. The series was tied at three wins apiece and a tie entering the eighth and deciding game, with millions of Canadians watching \\"the game of the century\\". With the game tied at five late in the third, the Soviets were met with a concerted Canadian attack in the final seven minutes. With 34 seconds remaining in the game, Esposito took a shot at Vladislav Tretiak from 12 feet out. Paul Henderson scooped up the rebound and put it past the fallen Soviet goalie to score the goal that won the game, 6–5, and the series. Later, Alexander Yakolev, the former Soviet ambassador to Canada, argued that the Summit Series planted the seeds of glasnost and perestroika in the Soviet Union, as it was one of the first times that the Soviet people had seen so many foreigners who had not come to do harm, but to share in the game. = Legacy = The series forced the NHL and the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association to reassess all aspects of how the game was played in North America. Journalist Herb Pinder described the NHL to that point in this way: \\"The Europeans took our game and evolved it, while we stood still or even went backwards. The Russians had a style, and the Czechs' style was different from that ... There was this hockey world evolving through international competition, and we're back here, stuck, just playing ourselves. It was a business monopoly. And like any monopoly, the NHL got stagnant.\\" Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Canadian hockey encouraged the adoption of new coaching and training methods used in Europe, and emphasized conditioning and skills development. The NHL took a greater interest in international play. The Canada Cup, a tournament that featured the top professional players in the world, was held first in 1976, and then four more times until 1991. It was succeeded by the World Cup of Hockey in 1996. Beginning in 1975, Soviet club teams began touring North America, playing NHL clubs in exhibition games that were known as the Super Series. The Calgary Flames and Washington Capitals similarly toured the Soviet Union in 1989 in the first \\"Friendship Series\\". The Soviet national team defeated an NHL all- star team in a 1979 challenge series, two games to one, and split Rendez-vous '87, a two-game series held in Quebec City.  1970s = Broad Street Bullies = The 1970s were associated with aggressive, and often violent, play. Known as the \\"Broad Street Bullies\\", the Philadelphia Flyers are the most famous example of this style. The Flyers established league records for penalty minutes—Dave \\"the Hammer\\" Schultz's total of 472 in 1974–75 remains a league record—and ended up in courtrooms multiple times when players went into the stands to challenge fans who got involved. One such incident occurred in Vancouver in December 1972, when a fan reached over the glass to pull the hair of Don Saleski, who had a chokehold on Vancouver's Barry Wilkins. Bobby Taylor and several Flyers teammates followed the fan into the stands. The next time Philadelphia went to Vancouver, several players were brought before the courts on charges that ranged from use of obscene language to common assault. Six players were fined, and Taylor received a 30-day suspended sentence. Despite these incidents, the Flyers won: they captured the 1974 Stanley Cup, becoming the first expansion team to win the league championship, and repeated as champions in 1975. In 1975, Soviet club teams began to tour North America in the first Super Series. The Canadiens played Central Red Army to a 3–3 draw on New Year's Eve 1975, in a game that is considered one of the finest ever played. Red Army lost only one of four games against the NHL in the first tour, a 4–1 defeat to Philadelphia, who intimidated them as the Flyers did to their NHL opponents. At one point, Red Army threatened to forfeit the game after Ed Van Impe decked Valeri Kharlamov. Red Army was persuaded to complete the game after Alan Eagleson threatened to withhold their appearance fee if the team did not return to the ice. Super Series games continued until 1991, when Soviet players were allowed to enter the NHL after the collapse of the Soviet Union. = End of the two-league era = The Colorado Rockies battle the Atlanta Flames in 1978. These teams are now the New Jersey Devils and Calgary Flames respectively. On February 7, 1976, Maple Leafs star Darryl Sittler set an NHL record, scoring 10 points in one game in an 11–4 victory over the Bruins. His six-goal, four-assist effort broke Maurice Richard's record of eight points in a game. The game came shortly after the Bruins lured Gerry Cheevers back from the WHA, though Cheevers was given an extra night to rest, and rookie Dave Reece was the victim of all 11 Toronto goals. It was his 14th, and final, NHL game. By 1976, both leagues were dealing with serious financial problems. Talks of a merger between the NHL and the WHA were growing. Bobby Hull declared that a merger was \\"inevitable\\", though WHA president Bill MacFarland stated that his league had no interest in joining with the NHL. In 1976, for the first time in four decades, the NHL approved franchise relocations; the Scouts moved after just two years in Kansas City to Denver to become the Colorado Rockies, while the California Golden Seals became the Cleveland Barons. In its wake, the league quietly shelved provisional expansion franchises granted to Seattle and Denver to take place in the 1977 season. Two years later, after failed overtures towards merging the Barons with Washington and Vancouver, they merged with the Minnesota North Stars, reducing the NHL to 17 teams for 1978–79. The WHA's last triumph was to lure junior prodigy Wayne Gretzky to their league in 1978–79. Nelson Skalbania, owner of the Indianapolis Racers and part owner of the Edmonton Oilers, was convinced to sign Gretzky to play for the Racers. The 17-year-old Gretzky scored 110 points in his first professional season, split between the Racers and the Oilers. The move towards a merger picked up in 1977 when John Ziegler succeeded Campbell as NHL president. After several years of negotiations, WHA owners thought they had an agreement in March 1979. The motion to merge failed when supporters in the NHL lost by one vote. Word got out that the Montreal Canadiens, owned by Molson Brewery, and the Vancouver Canucks, who served Molson products at their games, had voted against the merger. Fans across Canada quickly organized a boycott of Molson products, while the House of Commons unanimously passed a motion urging the NHL to reconsider. Another vote was held, and both Montreal and Vancouver switched their votes, allowing the motion to pass. The WHA folded following the 1978–79 season, and the Edmonton Oilers, New England Whalers, Quebec Nordiques and Winnipeg Jets joined the NHL as expansion teams.  Twenty-one teams  Ray Bourque in 1981, before he switched to his familiar number 77; one of the great stars of the 80s and 90s, he retired as the highest scoring defenseman of all time. The merger brought Gordie Howe back to the NHL for one final season in 1979–80. At age 51, Howe played all 80 games for the Whalers, scoring 15 goals to bring his NHL career total to 801. He entered his second retirement as the league's all-time scoring leader with 1,850 points. Howe's final season was also the last for the Atlanta Flames. The team averaged an attendance of only 9,800 fans per game and lost over $2 million in 1979–80. They were sold for a record $16 million, and relocated north to become the Calgary Flames in 1980–81. Two years later, the Rockies were sold for $30 million, and left Denver to become the New Jersey Devils for the 1982–83 season. The St. Louis Blues nearly relocated to Saskatoon in 1983, as Bill Hunter, an original investor in the WHA, announced an intention to purchase and relocate the team. Hunter quickly convinced 18,000 people to commit to season tickets in a proposed arena for the city. The other team owners rejected the sale and relocation by a 15–3 vote, prompting the Blues' owner, Ralston Purina, to file a $60 million anti-trust lawsuit against the league. Both the league as a whole and the individual teams filed $78 million counter suits against Purina. As part of the conflict, Purina turned the team over to the NHL at the beginning of June 1983 to \\"operate, sell or dispose of in whatever manner the league desires\\", while the Blues refused to participate in the 1983 NHL Entry Draft, forfeiting all of their draft picks. By the end of July, the league had sold the team to Harry Ornest, who vowed the team would remain in St. Louis. Ralston Purina and the NHL settled their legal issues in 1985, though terms of the settlements were not released. In 1980, the New York Islanders won their first of four consecutive Stanley Cups. With the likes of Billy Smith, Mike Bossy, Denis Potvin, and Bryan Trottier, the Islanders dominated both the regular season and the playoffs. In 1981, Bossy became the first player to score 50 goals in 50 games since Maurice Richard in 1945. In 1982–83, the Edmonton Oilers won the regular season championship. The Islanders and Oilers met in the Finals and New York swept Edmonton for their last Stanley Cup. They were the second franchise to win four straight championships, after the Canadiens. The 1984 playoffs would be the site of the infamous Good Friday Massacre between the Quebec Nordiques and the Montreal Canadiens. The following season, the Oilers and Islanders met again in the playoffs. The Oilers won the rematch in five games, marking the start of another dynasty. Led by Wayne Gretzky and Mark Messier, the Oilers won five Stanley Cup championships between 1984 and 1990. The Oilers won two consecutive Cups in the 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons, and in the 1986–87 and 1987–88 seasons. They also won a Cup in the 1989–90 season. The Oilers' Cup streaks were interrupted in the 1985–86 and 1988–89 seasons by two other Canadian teams. Edmonton's hopes for a third consecutive title in 1986 were dashed by their provincial rival, the Calgary Flames, after Oilers' rookie Steve Smith accidentally bounced the series-winning goal off goaltender Grant Fuhr and into his own net. Smith's error remains one of the most legendary blunders in hockey history. The Flames were defeated by the Canadiens in the finals, as rookie goaltender Patrick Roy led Montreal to their 23rd Stanley Cup. The 1989 final was a rematch between the Flames and the Canadiens and was won by Calgary, which captured its only championship in franchise history. The Flames also became the only team to defeat the Montreal Canadiens for the Stanley Cup at the Montreal Forum. The league would move its headquarters from Montreal to New York City in 1989. The 21-team era ended in 1990, when the league revealed ambitious plans to double league revenues from $400 million within a decade and bring the NHL to 28 franchises during that period. The NHL quickly announced three new teams: the San Jose Sharks, who began play in the 1991–92 season, and the Ottawa Senators and Tampa Bay Lightning, who followed a year later. The Sharks' creation forestalled a unilateral franchise move by North Stars owners George and Gordon Gund to the San Francisco Bay Area. A settlement with the league granted them the expansion franchise, while they sold the North Stars to Howard Baldwin's group in 1990. Prior to the 1991–92 season, the Sharks and North Stars participated in a unique expansion draft, which saw San Jose select unprotected players from Minnesota (including future All-Star goalie Arturs Irbe) before both teams picked players from the remainder of the league. The Sharks would struggle in their inaugural season, finishing with a league-low 17 wins and 39 points while playing out of the Cow Palace, while the North Stars (who were sold again, to Norman Green, during the 1990–91 season) would make the playoffs for what proved to be the final time before their eventual relocation to Dallas in 1993. = Wayne Gretzky = A statue of Wayne Gretzky raising the Stanley Cup in front of Edmonton's Rogers Place In the latter part of the 1980s, the Oilers won five Stanley Cup titles in seven years, becoming the only team to score 400 or more goals in a season, which they did four times. With future Hall of Famers Grant Fuhr, Paul Coffey, Jari Kurri, Mark Messier, and Glenn Anderson, they established numerous new scoring records. The Oilers were led by Wayne Gretzky, who remained with the Oilers when they joined the NHL in 1979. At and , some observers doubted that Gretzky could match his offensive performance from his lone WHA season. \\"I heard a lot of talk then that I'd never get 110 points like I did in the WHA,\\" said Gretzky. He proved his critics wrong, scoring 137 points in 1979–80 and winning the first of nine Hart Trophies (including 8 consecutive awards from 1980–1988) as the NHL's most valuable player. Over the next several seasons, Gretzky established new highs in goals scored in a season, with 92 in the 1981–82 season; in assists, with 163 in the 1985–86; and in total points, with 215 in 1985–86. He also scored 50 goals in 39 games, the fastest any player had reached the total in a single season. Gretzky scored his 1,000th NHL point in his 424th game, breaking Guy Lafleur's old record of 720 games. Gretzky's teammates set records of their own. Fuhr's 14 assists in the 1983–84 season set a record for most points by a goaltender in a season. In 1985–86, Coffey set a record for the most goals in a season by a defenceman, with 48. Adding 90 assists, Coffey wound up a point short of tying Bobby Orr's record for most points in a season by a blue-liner. On August 9, 1988, Oilers owner Peter Pocklington, in financial trouble, traded Gretzky, along with Marty McSorley and Mike Krushelnyski, to the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for Jimmy Carson, Martin Gelinas, US$15 million and three first-round draft picks. Gretzky left Edmonton with a tear-filled news conference, and later said that Edmonton was the only place he ever dreaded playing. Gretzky's trade to the Kings popularized ice hockey in the United States, making hockey \\"cool\\" in Hollywood, and shocked fans across Canada. The Kings were the most popular Los Angeles sports team, and Gretzky's fame rivaled that of his peers with baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers and basketball's Los Angeles Lakers. With the Kings, Gretzky broke Gordie Howe's record for career points. On October 15, 1989, against his former Oilers' teammates, and with Howe in attendance, Gretzky tied the record with a first period assist before notching his 1,851st career point with a third period goal. \\"An award such as this takes a lot of teamwork and help and both teams here today definitely have a part of the 1,851 [points].\\" said Gretzky.  Fall of the Iron Curtain  Alexander Mogilny, pictured in 2006, was among the first Soviets to play in the NHL in 1989. While European-born players were a part of the NHL since its founding, it was still rare to see them in the league until 1980. The WHA turned to the previously overlooked European market in search for talent, signing players from Finland and Sweden. Anders Hedberg, Lars-Erik Sjoberg and Ulf Nilsson signed with the Jets in 1974 and thrived in North America, both in the WHA and later the NHL. The Jets won three of the six remaining WHA championships after signing European players, and their success sparked similar signings league- wide. Borje Salming was the first European star in the NHL. He signed with the Maple Leafs in 1973, and played 16 seasons in the NHL, retiring in 1990. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1996. His fellow Swede, Pelle Lindbergh, was one of the top goaltenders in the world in the early 1980s. He led the Flyers to the 1985 Stanley Cup Finals before dying in a car accident during the 1985–86 season. Finns Jari Kurri and Esa Tikkanen helped lead the Oilers dynasty of the 1980s. While the WHA opened the door, and players slowly joined the NHL, those behind the Iron Curtain were restricted from following suit. In 1980, Peter Stastny, his wife, and his brother Anton secretly fled Czechoslovakia with the aid of Nordiques owner Marcel Aubut. The Stastnys' defection made international headlines, and contributed to the first wave of Eastern Europeans' entrance into the NHL. Hoping that they would one day be permitted to play in the NHL, teams drafted Soviet players in the 1980s, 27 in all by the 1988 draft. However, defection was the only way such players could join the teams that drafted them. Michal Pivonka defected from Czechoslovakia in 1986, while Russian Alexander Mogilny defected following the 1989 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in Anchorage, Alaska. Czech teenager Petr Nedved walked into a Calgary police station in January 1989 after playing in the Mac's AAA midget hockey tournament. Shortly before the end of the 1988–89 regular season, Flames general manager Cliff Fletcher announced that he had reached an agreement with Soviet authorities that allowed Sergei Pryakhin to play in North America. It was the first time a member of the Soviet national team was permitted to play for a non-Soviet team. Shortly after, Soviet players began to flood into the NHL. Teams anticipated that there would be an influx of Soviet players in the 1990s, as 18 Soviets were selected in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft. The entire \\"KLM\\" line, the Soviet team's top line, joined the NHL in 1989 as Vladimir Krutov and Igor Larionov played for the Canucks, while Sergei Makarov went to Calgary. Makarov won the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year in 1990, a selection that caused controversy; he was 32 years old and had played 11 pro seasons in the Soviet League. In the wake of the controversy, the NHL amended its rules: players over the age of 26 were no longer considered for the award. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the demise of the Iron Curtain paved the way for more Eastern European players to play in North America. Only six European players were selected at the 1979 NHL Entry Draft. That number increased to 32 in 1989, while a record 123 Europeans were drafted in 2000. Europeans made up 22.5% of the NHL in 2013–14, totalling 232 players.  Rules and innovations  The early 1980s saw many tie games. The 1982–83 North Stars and Capitals both finished with 16 ties in 80 games, while 17 of 21 teams tied 10 or more games. The season before, the North Stars recorded 20 ties. As a result of the frequent ties, the NHL reintroduced overtime for the 1983–84 season. The effect was immediate, as only seven teams had ten or more ties. Before its discontinuation during World War II, the NHL played a full 10-minute overtime period. The modern overtime format was set as a five-minute, sudden death period; the game ended when either team scored. The NHL changed its divisional alignment and playoff formats numerous times as it grew. The league's doubling in 1967 also led to the expansion of the playoffs to eight teams from four the previous year. Expansion to 18 teams in 1974 caused the league to realign into two conferences and four divisions, each named after important figures in league history. The teams were split into the Campbell Conference, consisting of the Patrick and Smythe divisions, and the Prince of Wales Conference, consisting of the Adams and Norris divisions. The playoffs were expanded to 12 teams, and each division winner was granted a bye in the first round of the playoffs. The addition of the four WHA teams in 1979 saw the playoffs expanded to 16 teams. In 1981, the league realigned all teams by geography, although the historical names of the divisions remained. Eastern teams played in the Adams and Patrick divisions of the Wales Conference, and Western teams played in the Norris and Smythe divisions of the Campbell Conference. In addition, the playoff format was changed to have the top four teams in each division qualify rather than the top 16 teams overall. The first two playoff rounds were played entirely within each division. This format lasted until 1993. = Entry Draft = During the late 1960s, the concept of sponsoring junior players and teams had been dismantled, meaning that for the 1969 NHL Amateur Draft, every player aged 20 or above was eligible to be selected. The Montreal Canadiens, however, exercised a special \\"cultural option\\" that allowed them to select two players of French-Canadian heritage, before any other players were selected. These players counted as Montreal's first two choices. After the Canadiens took Rejean Houle and Marc Tardif, the rest of the league voted to end the rule in 1970, just before future star Gilbert Perreault was selected first in the 1970 expansion draft by the Buffalo Sabres. In 1974, Sabres general manager Punch Imlach decided to play a joke on the league during the draft. He selected Taro Tsujimoto of the \\"Tokyo Katanas\\" with his 11th round pick. Other teams were shocked that the Sabres had scouted for players in Japan, and the league made the pick official. Weeks later, Imlach admitted that he made the player up, choosing the name out of a phone book. The league reformatted the Amateur Draft into the NHL Entry Draft in 1979 and simultaneously lowered the draft age to 19. It was first opened to the public in 1980, when 2,500 fans attended the draft in the Montreal Forum. The public draft has grown such that it is now held annually in NHL arenas and televised internationally.

Apart from being a marvel to contemporary Charlestonians, it was a strategic naval artillery platform that took part in the bombardment of Fort Sumter on April 12 and April 13, 1861, making it the first floating battery to engage in hostilities during the Civil War.Suhr Background Following the November 6, 1860, election of Abraham Lincoln, there was a popular outcry for secession in Charleston, South Carolina. Relations between the local citizens and the U.S. Army forces that occupied various posts around the Charleston harbor area began to deteriorate. On November 8, Colonel John L. Gardner, federal garrison commander, angered Charlestonians when he attempted to remove all of the small-arms ammunition from the Charleston Arsenal.Swanberg, pp. 19-20. Gardner attempted to pacify the angry crowd by returning the ammunition which may have saved him at the time but he would eventually be relieved of his command for his actions nonetheless. Governor F. W. Pickens ordered South Carolina State troops to stand guard over the arsenal. When the new garrison commander, Major Robert Anderson, sent Captain J. G. Foster to get 100 muskets for the workmen of Castle Pinckney and Fort Sumter, he was flatly refused by Colonel B. H. Huger who cited that special orders from Washington would be necessary.Swanberg, p. 44. Maj. Robert Anderson, photo by Mathew Brady Maj. Anderson consolidated the majority of his troops at Fort Moultrie but found this to be a poorly defensible position. Sand dunes rose almost to the height of the parapet walls on the inland side and neighboring houses towered above the fort walls affording too many opportunities for militia sharpshooters.Swanberg, p. 38. Following the December 20 secession of South Carolina from the Union, Anderson planned an evacuation across the harbor channel to Ft. Sumter. State troops sounded alarms on the morning of December 27 when they discovered that Anderson's forces had abandoned Ft. Moultrie during the evening of December 26, spiking the guns and setting fire to the gun carriages before the last troops left. This infuriated the citizens of Charleston who viewed the evacuation and destruction as a breach of good faith.Hanson, 2003. Governor Pickens ordered that all remaining federal positions except Ft. Sumter were to be seized. State troops quickly occupied Ft. Moultrie (capturing 56 guns), Ft. Johnson, and the Morris Island Battery. At about 4 p.m. on December 27, an assault force of 150 men seized the Union- occupied Castle Pinckney fortification capturing 24 guns and mortars without bloodshed. On December 30, the federal arsenal was captured with the Union crew held in their quarters. The capture from the arsenal was massive with more than 22,000 ordnance pieces being appropriated by the militia.Ripley, p. 6. The Confederates promptly made repairs, unspiked the guns, built new gun carriages, and reinforced the fortifications at Ft. Moultrie. Dozens of new batteries and defense positions were constructed throughout the Charleston harbor area and armed with weapons captured from the arsenal. Intent on gaining a strategic advantage in artillery position, the Confederates adopted the contemporary military idea of implementing floating batteries. The French Navy had enjoyed success using floating batteries in the Battle of Kinburn (1855) to demolish Russian forts during the Crimean War.Wilson, p. xxxiv. Construction Drawing of the Floating Battery of Charleston Harbor The battery was constructed on the waterfront of Charleston, South Carolina in view of the Union forces at Ft. Sumter near the mouth of Charleston harbor. Construction began in January 1861, under the leadership of Lieutenant John R. Hamilton formerly an officer in the United States Navy and the son of a former governor of South Carolina.Suhr, p. 1. Built of pine heartwood logs sawn twelve inches (305 mm) square, it was buttressed by palmetto logs on the bow and the exterior of the vessel was clad in two layers of railroad iron vertically and four layers of boiler iron horizontally.Bostick, p. 57. Its dimensions were approximately twenty-five feet wide by one hundred feet long. The massive front bow of the battery resembled a peaked barn to onlookers who branded it with that nickname. Along the barn face were four evenly-spaced casemate windows suitable for the naval guns to fire through. The battery's armament consisted of two 42 lb and two 32 lb naval artillery guns. A detailed drawing by a Confederate officer illustrates the guns (the fourth is not depicted).Appleton's Annual Cyclopædia incorrectly lists the armament as 4 42-pounders, p. 666. To offset the weight of the barn with the armament added, the vessel was counterbalanced at the rear with 6 ft. thick sandbag emplacements along the length of the stern. The powder magazines were below the sandbags while shot was stored behind the guns in covered bins beneath the deck. Positioned behind the stern and on its own separate raft was a small floating hospital. Hospital interior drawing from Frank Leslie's Newspaper The March 30, 1861, issue of Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper contains a detailed sketch of the hospital interior. There appears to be at least eight hospital beds and two operating tables. Access was gained by a steeply-angled staircase through a hatch in the roof. A framed wooden door allowed for entry and exit on the starboard side of the hospital closer to the waterline while two framed glass sash windows allowed in light on the port side. Window casements framed into the roof allowed for some additional light and ventilation.Interior, p. 292. Reaction Capt. John G. Foster, photo by Mathew Brady circa 1863. Captain John G. Foster, a Union Army engineering officer observing from Fort Sumter, wrote reports to his superiors about the progress of the battery construction. Foster's assessment of the battery was dismissive, \\"...I think it can be destroyed by our fire before it has time to do much damage...\\" and he followed a few days later with, \\"...I do not think this floating battery will prove very formidable...\\" Nonetheless, his superior, Major Robert Anderson was apprehensive enough that he inquired for specific instructions from Washington regarding the threat of the battery. He was instructed that if he became convinced that the battery was advanced for the purpose of immediate attack then he would be justified in firing on it but if it was only being moved for the purposes of general emplacement that he should exercise forbearance.Ripley, p. 10. Charleston Harbor, showing forts and the Confederate artillery positions that bombarded Fort Sumter. The Floating battery is at the tip of Sullivan's Island. Members of the Confederate crew were apprehensive about the battery as well but for different reasons. Some of them feared that it would capsize and began referring to it as \\"the slaughter pen\\". Union soldiers glibly named it \\"the raft\\". Crowds gathered on the waterfront of Charleston to marvel at and celebrate the completed battery in ceremony on March 15 despite cold weather. A seven gun salute was fired to honor the seven states that had already seceded and after a pause, an additional gun was fired on behalf of Arkansas whose secession was pending.FROM 1861. Public reaction in the North to the floating battery was as marked as had been their Southern counterparts' enthusiasm. The New York Herald invited readers to visit their offices so they could see a palmetto log similar to those used in the battery. The Herald also posted that another log had been brought north to sell to showman P.T. Barnum but that Barnum had balked at the $150 asking price. Bombardment of Fort Sumter Artistic depiction of the Floating Battery of Charleston Harbor while engaged in the Battle of Fort Sumter Sometime in the dark hours between April 9 and April 10,LATEST 1861. the battery was towed and emplaced near the western end of Sullivan's Island by order of Brigadier General P. G. T. Beauregard. It was manned by members of Company D of the South Carolina Artillery Battalion and commanded by Capt. Hamilton. On April 12, Hamilton's floating battery commenced in a 34-hour intermittent artillery siege against Union army forces occupying Ft. Sumter.Ripley, p. 9. The battery was struck several times by artillery fire from Ft. Sumter. According to Appleton's Annual Cyclopædia, \\"... The guns that bore on the three batteries at the west end of 'Sullivan's Island' were 10 32-pounders, situated on the left face, and on at the pan- coupe of the salient angle, (four embrasures being bricked up.)\\"Appletons, p. 667. By midday, a shortage of cartridges in Ft. Sumter forced the Union troops to lower the number of guns to only two in active battery against the batteries at the western end of Sullivan's Island. \\"The so-called 'floating battery' was struck very frequently by shot, one of them penetrating at the angle between the front and the roof, entirely through the iron covering and wood work beneath, and wounding one man. The rest of the 32-pounder balls failed to penetrate the front or the roof, but were deflected from their surfaces, which were arranged at a suitable angle for this purpose.\\" The damage was considered minimal and with Maj. Anderson's surrender of Ft. Sumter, the Confederates and the crew of Hamilton's floating battery were victorious. Newspapers and magazines proliferated details of the battle and surrender. \\"On Friday, 12th, at 27 minutes past 4 A. M., General Beauregard, in accordance with instructions received on Wednesday from the Secretary of War of the Southern Confederacy, opened fire upon Fort Sumter. Forts Johnson and Moultrie, the iron battery at Cumming's Point, and the Stevens Floating Battery, kept up an active cannonade during the entire day, and probably during the past night. The damage done to Fort Sumter is stated by the Confederate authorities to have been considerable. Guns had been dismounted, and a part of the parapet swept away.\\"Beginning  Harper's Weekly Beauregard commended Capt. Hamilton in his battle report written at the Provisional Army Headquarters, Charleston, S.C., April 27, 1861. He wrote \\"...I would also mention in the highest terms of praise Captains Calhoun and Hallonquist, assistant commandants of batteries to Colonel Ripley; and the following commanders of batteries on Sullivan's Island: Capt. J. R. Hamilton, commanding the floating battery and Dahlgren gun; Captains Butler, South Carolina Army, and Bruns, aide-de-camp to General Dunovant, and Lieutenants Wagner, Rhett, Yates, Valentine, and Parker.\\" Fate Remains of the Floating Battery, Charleston Harbor, 1863 Damage was assessed with reports and twenty-two photographs \\"showing the condition of Forts Sumter and Moultrie and of the floating battery after the surrender of the former fort\\" and sent to LeRoy Pope Walker, Secretary of War for the Confederate States of America, in Montgomery, Alabama on April 27, 1861.Beauregard, 1861. Details of the battery's history beyond this point are somewhat elusive. According to a United States Coast Survey chart of 1863, the battery is depicted as anchored in the harbor between Middle Ground and Ft. Johnson but later charts rendered in 1865 do not indicate the existence of the battery. The Confederates apparently ended up stripping the iron off the battery at some point to construct a navigable ironclad.Suhr 1996c. There may be evidence that the dismantled battery broke up later during a storm as early as the latter part of 1863. One diarist, serving on Morris Island, wrote that they had a shortage of fuel until one morning after a storm when they found logs purportedly from the battery washed up on the beach. In 1865, a visitor to Charleston described the harbor entrance with this description, \\"... Just beyond the ruin (of Ft. Sumter) at the left, lies the wreck of the famous old floating battery ... A portion of one of its sides, with four portholes visible, still remains above the water. ...\\" NotesReferences *Appletons' Annual Cyclopædia and Register of Important Events of the Year... 1867.

According to Gujarat police, the breakthrough in the 2008 Ahmedabad serial blasts case came from five 'switched-off' mobile phone numbers. Joint Commissioner of Police (crime) Ashish Bhatia said that the terrorists had procured five SIM cards of phones that were switched off on the day of the blasts – 26 July. The analysis of the phone calls made to those SIM cards from PCOs provided them the key leads. The arrest of ten suspects included the leader, Mufti Abu Bashir Ishlahi alias Abdul Wasir, who was arrested with the help of Uttar Pradesh police at his father's home at Sarai Mir in Azamgarh, Uttar Pradesh\\"Hang him if he is a terrorist, says Abu Bashir's father\\" on 14 August 2008. Bashir studied in the local Madarsatul Islah and later in Deoband in Saharanpur. According to the reports, Bashir claimed that the bombings cost Rs 75,000. A SIMI activist sold his house in Kutch to get the amount.\\"Mufti Abu Bashir admits involvement In Ahmedabad blasts: Police!\\" Bashir, who had stayed in Ahmedabad along with Abdul Subhan Qureshi alias Tauqeer, a co-conspirator, had bought five SIM cards using local names and addresses.The art of mastering SIMple cards He had used these cell phone numbers to remain in touch with the other members of the module at the planning stage of the conspiracy. Bashir had given the SIM cards to the bomb planters on 26 July, who had used them carefully. Each member had contacted the others through STD-PCO booths after successfully planting the bombs. These numbers were used only for receiving calls. Many of the calls were from Juhapura, where Zahid Shaikh, one of the key members of the group, lived at Sandhi Avenue near the Sarkhej highway. These numbers had become inactive immediately after the blasts. The Government also suspects Indian Mujahideen for the two blasts in Hyderabad on 21 February 2013 at 7:01 pm.

They were arrested in Jaipur and Jodhpur in Rajasthan. Ejaz Sheikh, wanted in several cases including a terror strike in Jama Masjid in New Delhi, was arrested on 6 September 2014 from the Saharanpur area of western Uttar Pradesh by the Special Cell of the Delhi Police. He is considered a \\"technical expert\\" and considered a key member of Indian Mujahideen (IM).  Jamia Nagar encounter  On 19 September 2008, the police raided an apartment in Jamia Nagar, near Jamia Millia Islamia In Delhi. There is speculation that the prime suspect in the Ahmedabad blasts, Mufti, a madrasa teacher from Azamgarh, may have pointed out the apartment. The raid resulted in the death of terrorists Bashir alias Mohammed Atif Amin (son of Mohammed Amin, cloth merchant in Bhiwandi, Mumbai) and Mohammad Sajid, and a decorated police officer, Mohan Chand Sharma, in the gunfight. Mohammad Saif (the son of Samajwadi Party leader Shadab Ahmed) was arrested while two hostiles managed to flee by possibly jumping the rooftops. All of the suspects were from the town of Sarai Mir in Azamgarh district. They claimed to be students, but that was denied by Jamia Millia. The five were responsible for manufacturing bombs used in the Ahmedabad, Jaipur and Delhi blasts. Atif claimed to have been studying for a diploma in human resources development from Jamia Milia Islamia University.\\"Atif didn't shy from tenant verification\\" However Jamia Milia denied having him as a student. Some residents of Sarai Mir thought he was pursuing his bachelor's degree in technology from Jamia Hamdard. Atif was said to have been the leader of a group of 14 young men belong to Azamgarh in Uttar Pradesh, all claiming to have been studying in Delhi: Atif (24), Sajid alias Pankaj (19) (both now dead), Shehzad alias Pappu (22), Junaid (27), Shahdab Bhai alias Mallick (27), Sajid (24), Mohammad Khalid (25), Arif (22), Shakil (26), Zia Khan (24) and Salman (25), Zeeshan (24) and Mohammad Saif (23). Zeeshan Jawed was arrested from the offices of a private TV station. He worked for a private company, Monarch International on Vikas Marg, and is also said to be studying management. Both he and Saif claim to have been recruited by Atif. It is reported that Mohammad Saif has said that the plans to carry out several blasts across the country were mooted about three years ago when the Indian Mujahideen (IM) was formed. Although the blasts spanned a period of 10 months (the first blasts took place in August 2007 in Hyderabad), the planning was made far back in 2005. After that a series of explosions occurred in Uttar Pradesh, Jaipur, Ahmedabad and Delhi. There is considerable resentment in Sarai Mir over the death of the local boys. Villagers have blamed the media for giving a bad name to Azamgarh by calling it a \\"nursery of terror\\". Mafia don Abu Salem hails from here. Azamgarh used to export its famous country-made pistols, known as \\"kattas\\", whose factories dot the region. The district was also known for young sharpshooters who joined Mumbai gangs. Individuals from the area have been accused of the murders of Bollywood producer Gulshan Kumar in Mumbai and Left leader Shankar Guha Niyogi in Chhattisgarh.

The first newspaper report was published in the Point Pleasant Register dated November 16, 1966, titled \\"Couples See Man-Sized Bird ... Creature ... Something\\". The national press soon picked up the reports and helped spread the story across the United States. The Mothman was introduced to a wider audience by Gray Barker in 1970Skeptical Inquirer, Volume 33 (Pennsylvania State University, Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal., 2009).Gray Barker, The Silver Bridge (Saucerian Books, 1970). Reprinted in 2008 entitled The Silver Bridge: The Classic Mothman Tale (BookSurge Publishing). , and was later popularized by John Keel in his 1975 book The Mothman Prophecies, claiming that there were supernatural events related to the sightings, and a connection to the collapse of the Silver Bridge. The Mothman appears in popular culture. The 2002 film The Mothman Prophecies, starring Richard Gere, was based on Keel's book.Paul Meehan, Cinema of the Psychic Realm: A Critical Survey, page 130 (McFarland & Company, Inc., 2009). An annual festival in Point Pleasant is devoted to the Mothman legend. History On November 15, 1966, two young couples from Point Pleasant, Roger and Linda Scarberry and Steve and Mary Mallette, told police they saw a large grey creature whose eyes \\"glowed red\\" when the car's headlights picked it up. They described it as a \\"large flying man with ten-foot wings\\", following their car while they were driving in an area outside of town known as \\"the TNT area\\", the site of a former World War II munitions plant. During the next few days, other people reported similar sightings. Two volunteer firemen who saw it said it was a \\"large bird with red eyes\\". Mason County Sheriff George Johnson commented that he believed the sightings were due to an unusually large heron he termed a \\"shitepoke\\". Contractor Newell Partridge told Johnson that when he aimed a flashlight at a creature in a nearby field its eyes glowed \\"like bicycle reflectors\\", and blamed buzzing noises from his television set and the disappearance of his German Shepherd dog on the creature. Wildlife biologist Dr. Robert L. Smith at West Virginia University told reporters that descriptions and sightings all fit the sandhill crane, a large American crane almost as high as a man with a seven-foot wingspan featuring circles of reddish coloring around the eyes, and that the bird may have wandered out of its migration route. This particular crane was unrecognized at first because it was not native to this region. After the December 15, 1967, collapse of the Silver Bridge and the death of 46 people, the incident gave rise to the legend and connected the Mothman sightings to the bridge collapse. 'The Mothman Prophecies' (2002) is a major motion picture, loosely based on the 1975 book of the same name by John Keel. According to Georgian newspaper Svobodnaya Gruziya, Russian UFOlogists claim that Mothman sightings in Moscow foreshadowed the 1999 Russian apartment bombings. (English translation of the article.) In 2016, WCHS-TV published a photo purported to be of Mothman taken by an anonymous man while driving on Route 2. Science writer Sharon A. Hill proposed that the photo showed \\"a bird, perhaps an owl, carrying a frog or snake away\\" and wrote that \\"there is zero reason to suspect it is the Mothman as described in legend. There are too many far more reasonable explanations.\\" Analysis Folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand notes that Mothman has been widely covered in the popular press, some claiming sightings connected with UFOs, and others claiming that a military storage site was Mothman's \\"home\\". Brunvand notes that recountings of the 1966–67 Mothman reports usually state that at least 100 people saw Mothman with many more \\"afraid to report their sightings\\" but observed that written sources for such stories consisted of children's books or sensationalized or undocumented accounts that fail to quote identifiable persons. Brunvand found elements in common among many Mothman reports and much older folk tales, suggesting that something real may have triggered the scares and became woven with existing folklore. He also records anecdotal tales of Mothman supposedly attacking the roofs of parked cars occupied by teenagers. Conversely, Joe Nickell says that a number of hoaxes followed the publicity generated by the original reports, such as a group of construction workers who tied flashlights to helium balloons. Nickell attributes the Mothman stories to sightings of barn owls, suggesting that the Mothman's \\"glowing eyes\\" were actually red-eye effect caused from the reflection of light from flashlights or other bright light sources. Benjamin Radford points out that the only report of glowing \\"red eyes,\\" was secondhand, that of Shirley Hensley quoting her father. According to University of Chicago psychologist David A. Gallo, 55 sightings of Mothman in Chicago during 2017 published on the website of self-described Fortean researcher Lon Strickler are \\"a selective sample\\". Gallo explains that \\"he's not sampling random people and asking if they saw the Mothman – he's just counting the number of people that voluntarily came forward to report a sighting.\\" According to Gallo, \\"people more likely to visit a paranormal- centric website like Strickler's might also be more inclined to believe in, and therefore witness the existence of, a 'Mothman'.\\" Some pseudoscience adherents (such as ufologists, paranormal authors, and cryptozoologists) claim that Mothman was an alien, a supernatural manifestation, or a previously unknown species of animal. In his 1975 book The Mothman Prophecies, author John Keel claimed that the Point Pleasant residents experienced precognitions including premonitions of the collapse of the Silver Bridge, unidentified flying object sightings, visits from inhuman or threatening men in black, and other phenomena.Clark, Jerome (2000). Extraordinary Encounters: An Encyclopedia of Extraterrestrials and Otherworldly Beings Santa Barbara, California: ABC-Clio, , pp. 178-179. Festival and statue Point Pleasant held its first Annual Mothman Festival in 2002. The Mothman festival began after brainstorming creative ways for people to visit Point Pleasant. The group organizing the event chose the Mothman to be center of the festival due to its uniqueness, and as a way to celebrate its local legacy in the town. According to the event organizer, Jeff Wamsley, the average attendance for the Mothman is an estimated 10-12 thousand people per year. A 12-foot-tall metallic statue of the creature, created by artist and sculptor Bob Roach, was unveiled in 2003. The Mothman Museum and Research Center opened in 2005.Mothman StatueMark Moran, Mark Sceurman, Matt Lake, Weird U. S. The ODDyssey Continues - Your Travel Guide to America's Local Legends and Best Kept Secrets, page 260 (New York: Sterling Publishing Co., Inc., 2008). \\"Legend of the Mothman\\" plaque on base of statue The festival is held on the third weekend of every September, hosting guest speakers, vendor exhibits, pancake-eating contests, and hayride tours of locally notable areas. In June of 2020, a petition was started to replace all Confederate statues in the United States with statues of Mothman. As of July 2020, the petition has garnered over 2,000 signatures.

Biography Murray was born in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 1886. He received his education at Christ's College. All Black Toby Murray was his cousin. After school, he went to the local architect Frederick John Barlow as an apprentice. Murray was the New Zealand champion hurdler from 1906 to 1910 over 440 yards. He competed for Australasia in the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, England. He competed in two athletic events. In the 110 metres hurdles he was second in the heat (1-4.58). In the 400 metres hurdles he was second in the heat (59.8). As the heats were held as sudden death events, he did not qualify. He is listed as New Zealand Olympian number 2 by the New Zealand Olympic Committee. He married Ismene Nola Simms on 5 April 1916 in Brisbane. She was the daughter of H. G. Simms from London who had lately lived in Christchurch. From later that year, Murray served with the 11th Field Company of the Royal Australian Engineers in WWI. In 1917, he won a Military Cross for bravery. The citation reads: As an architect, Murray undertook many commissions for the Catholic Church. His best-known work in the Church of the Holy Name in Ashburton, which is registered by Heritage New Zealand as a Category I historic structure. The two other buildings designed by him that are registered by Heritage New Zealand, both as Category II, are the Scottish Hall in Invercargill and the Rangiora Town Hall. Another notable structure that he designed is the Akaroa War Memorial. Murray was a member of the Royal New Zealand Air Force during WWII. On Saturday, 10 April 1943, he was in a jeep that skidded on loose gravel near Whangarei Harbour and overturned. He died from his injuries early the following Monday morning. Murray's funeral was held at St Mary's Catholic Church in Central Christchurch and he was buried at Ruru Lawn Cemetery in Bromley.

MI6 Branch: Universal Exports – United Kingdom=M – Head of MI-6=Bernard Lee In the Bond films, Bernard Lee's character, M, is Admiral Sir Miles Messervy (only ever named, besides as 'M', as 'Admiral' and 'Miles' on screen in his appearances), Bond's irascible boss who sends him out on assignments. He also portrays M along with Lois Maxwell as Moneypenny in the 1975 French comedy \\" Bons baisers de Hong Kong\\". Lee was succeeded by Robert Brown, though not necessarily playing the same character (Brown had played another admiral in the series previously). Dame Judi Dench, a friend of Lee, would later take over the role of a brand-new M, starting in 1995 with some references to her predecessor, including an oil painting of Lee in the role seen in MI6's secondary HQ (a Scottish castle). Lee starred in eleven James Bond films. * Dr. No (1962) * From Russia with Love (1963) * Goldfinger (1964) * Thunderball (1965) * You Only Live Twice (1967) * On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969) * Diamonds Are Forever (1971) * Live and Let Die (1973) * The Man with the Golden Gun (1974) * The Spy Who Loved Me (1977) * Moonraker (1979) Robert Brown After Lee's death in 1981, the producers hired actor Robert Brown to continue the role in the Bond films. Brown picks up the role in Octopussy, however it is never explicitly stated on screen whether Robert Brown's character is intended to be the same person played by Lee, if he was intended to be Admiral Hargreaves, the role played by Brown in 1977's The Spy Who Loved Me, or if he is supposed to be another character altogether. Brown played M in the following James Bond films: * Octopussy (1983) * A View to a Kill (1985) * The Living Daylights (1987) * Licence to Kill (1989) Judi Dench In 1995, actress Dame Judi Dench became known to an international audience after taking over the role of M (James Bond's boss) with the James Bond film series, starting with GoldenEye. She is the only actor from Pierce Brosnan's Bond films to remain in the rebooted franchise. She appeared with Daniel Craig was cast as Bond in 2006's Casino Royale, 2008's Quantum of Solace and 2012's Skyfall. Dench played M in a total of eight films. * GoldenEye (1995) * Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) * The World Is Not Enough (1999) * Die Another Day (2002) * Casino Royale (2006) * Quantum of Solace (2008) * Skyfall (2012) * Spectre (2015) Ralph Fiennes In 2012, following the death of Judi Dench's M in Skyfall, the character of Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes) takes over from her in the role as M. Fiennes played M in the following films: * Skyfall (2012) * Spectre (2015) * No Time to Die (2020) =Q – Quartermaster=Desmond Llewelyn Starting with the second film in the James Bond series, From Russia with Love (1963), Desmond Llewelyn appeared as Q (the quartermaster of the MI6 gadget lab known as Q-branch) in every Bond film, except Live and Let Die (1973), until The World Is Not Enough (1999). He had originally been chosen for the role as he had previously worked with the director Terence Young on the 1950 war film They Were Not Divided. In the 2002 film Die Another Day, John Cleese, who played the character R, the assistant to Q in The World Is Not Enough, was promoted to the head of Q-branch, thus taking on the title of Q. In all, Llewelyn appeared in 17 Bond films, more than any other actor, and worked with the first five James Bond actors. He also portrayed Q in a 1967 made-for- television special (produced by Eon Productions) entitled, Welcome to Japan, Mr. Bond which was included in the 2006 special edition DVD release of You Only Live Twice. Desmond Llewelyn appears as Major Boothroyd/Q in the following films: * From Russia with Love (1963) * Goldfinger (1964) * Thunderball (1965) * You Only Live Twice (1967) * On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969) * Diamonds are Forever (1971) * The Man with the Golden Gun (1974) * The Spy Who Loved Me (1977) * Moonraker (1979) * For Your Eyes Only (1981) * Octopussy (1983) * A View to a Kill (1985) * The Living Daylights (1987) * Licence to Kill (1989) * Goldeneye (1995) * Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) * The World Is Not Enough (1999) John Cleese In 1999, comedian John Cleese appeared in the James Bond movie, The World Is Not Enough as Q's assistant, referred to by Bond as R. In 2002, when Cleese reprised his role in Die Another Day, the character was promoted, making Cleese the new quartermaster (Q) of MI6. In 2004, Cleese was featured as Q in the video game James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing, featuring his likeness and voice. Cleese appears as R/Q in the following films: * The World Is Not Enough (1999) * Die Another Day (2002) Ben Whishaw Actor Ben Whishaw took over the role in 2012's Skyfall. Q was absent from the two previous movies, Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace and it was Daniel Craig who had expressed concern over the character's absence, and expressed his hope that Q would return in Skyfall. Whishaw appears as Q in the following films: * Skyfall (2012) * Spectre (2015) =Moneypenny – Secretary=Lois Maxwell Lois Maxwell lobbied for the role in James Bond, as her husband had had a heart attack and they needed the money. Director Terence Young, who once had turned her down on the grounds that she looked like she \\"smelled of soap\\", offered her either Moneypenny or the recurring Bond girlfriend, Sylvia Trench, but she was uncomfortable with a revealing scene the latter had in the screenplay. The role as M's secretary guaranteed just two days' work at £100 per day; Maxwell supplied her own clothes. The Trench character, however, was eliminated after From Russia with Love. In 1967, Maxwell angered Sean Connery for a time by appearing in the Italian spy spoof Operation Kid Brother with the star's brother Neil Connery and Bernard Lee. In 1971, Maxwell was nearly replaced for Diamonds Are Forever after demanding a pay raise; her policewoman's cap disguises hair she had already dyed for another role. In 1975, she plays Moneypenny weeping for the death of James Bond in a short scene with Bernard Lee as M in the French comedy Bons Baisers de Hong Kong. For the filming of A View to a Kill, her final appearance, Bond producer Albert \\"Cubby\\" Broccoli told her that the two of them were the only ones from Dr. No still working on the series. Maxwell asked that her character be killed off, but Broccoli recast the role instead. As Moneypenny, according to author Tom Lisanti, she was seen as an \\"anchor\\", with her flirtatious repartee with Bond lending the films realism and humanism. For Moneypenny, Bond was \\"unobtainable\\", freeing the characters to make outrageous sexual double entendres. At the same time, her character did little to imbue the series with changing feminist notions. Her total screen time as Moneypenny in 14 films was less than two hours, and she spoke fewer than 200 words.http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/local/articles/1003death1003LoisMaxwell.html ; As Miss Moneypenny : * Dr. No (1962) * From Russia with Love (1963) * Goldfinger (1964) * Thunderball (1965) * You Only Live Twice (1967) * On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969) * Diamonds are Forever (1971) * Live and Let Die (1973) * The Man with the Golden Gun (1974) * The Spy Who Loved Me (1977) * Moonraker (1979) * For Your Eyes Only (1981) * Octopussy (1983) * A View to a Kill (1985) Caroline Bliss Caroline Bliss was only featured in two James Bond movies (the only two Timothy Dalton starred in as James Bond). Although, her role in Licence to Kill was little more than a cameo. She is the only actress to play Moneypenny while wearing glasses. She is also the youngest actress to play Moneypenny. * The Living Daylights (1987) * Licence to Kill (1989) Samantha Bond Samantha Bond starred in four James Bond films as Miss Moneypenny. She retired from her role with the departure of Pierce Brosnan as James Bond. She appeared as Miss Moneypenny in: * GoldenEye (1995) * Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) * The World Is Not Enough (1999) * Die Another Day (2002) In a commercial for London's 2012 Olympic bid, Bond once again suited up as Miss Moneypenny. She appeared alongside Roger Moore, who played 007 between 1973–1985. Naomie Harris The role of Miss Moneypenny was not cast in the following Bond films, Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace. The character eventually returned in the 2012 film, Skyfall, under the alias 'Eve'. Harris played Moneypenny in the following films: * Skyfall (2012) * Spectre (2015) =Sir Frederick Gray, the Minister of Defence=Geoffrey Keen He played the role of Frederick Gray, the Minister of Defence in six James Bond films between 1977 and 1987: * The Spy Who Loved Me (1977) (in this film Bond calls him \\"Freddie\\" – in private, after the briefing at the naval base – when Gray tells him that he is to go to Egypt.) * Moonraker (1979) * For Your Eyes Only (1981) * Octopussy (1983) * A View to a Kill (1985) * The Living Daylights (1987) =Bill Tanner – Chief of Staff=Michael Goodliffe Michael Goodliffe appeared in only one Bond film The Man with the Golden Gun in an uncredited appearance. * The Man with the Golden Gun (1974) Michael Kitchen Michael Kitchen appeared in two Bond films Goldeneye and The World Is Not Enough. * GoldenEye (1995) * The World Is Not Enough (1999) Rory Kinnear Rory Kinnear appeared as Bill Tanner in the three latest Bond films: Quantum of Solace, Skyfall and Spectre. * Quantum of Solace (2008) * Skyfall (2012) * Spectre (2015) =Charles Robinson – Chief of Staff=Colin Salmon Colin Salmon appeared in three Bond films as Chief of Staff Charles Robinson: Tomorrow Never Dies, The World Is Not Enough and Die Another Day. * Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) * The World Is Not Enough (1999) * Die Another Day (2002) Central Intelligence Agency/US Armed Forces – United States=Agent Felix Leiter=David Hedison David Hedison is also notable as the first actor to have played James Bond's ally Felix Leiter in more than one film (Live and Let Die and Licence to Kill) (The second was Jeffrey Wright, who appeared as Leiter in Casino Royale (2006), and reprised the role in Quantum of Solace). As Felix Leiter: * Live and Let Die (1973) * Licence to Kill (1989) Jeffrey Wright In 2006, Jeffrey Wright featured as Felix Leiter in the 21st James Bond movie, Casino Royale. This makes him the first African-American man to play the character in an Eon- produced Bond film (Bernie Casey played Leiter in the non-Eon Never Say Never Again). He also reprised the role in Quantum of Solace, making him only the second actor to appear as Leiter twice since David Hedison played the character in Live and Let Die and Licence to Kill. As Felix Leiter: * Casino Royale * Quantum of Solace =General Brad Whitaker/Agent Jack Wade=Joe Don Baker In 1987, Joe Don Baker got the role of the villain Brad Whitaker in the Bond film The Living Daylights, starring Timothy Dalton as James Bond. In 1995 and 1997 Baker returned to the series, this time playing a different character, CIA agent Jack Wade, in GoldenEye and Tomorrow Never Dies with Pierce Brosnan as Bond. The character of Wade is similar to that of CIA agent Darius Jedburgh, played by Baker in the 1985 BBC Television serial Edge of Darkness. He was nominated for \\"Best Actor\\" by the British Academy Television Awards. This serial was directed by Martin Campbell, who also cast Baker as Wade in GoldenEye. Baker was said to have actually tried out for the role of James Bond once for Live and Let Die. Baker also shares a birthday with fellow Bond girl Maud Adams. As General Brad Whitaker: * The Living Daylights (1987) As CIA Agent Jack Wade: * GoldenEye (1995) * Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) Other actors=Michael G. Wilson= In 1972 Michael G. Wilson joined Eon Productions, the production company responsible for the James Bond film series dating back to 1962 that began with his stepfather Albert R. 'Cubby' Broccoli and Harry Saltzman. Wilson specifically worked in Eon Productions's legal department until taking a more active role as an assistant to Cubby Broccoli for the film The Spy Who Loved Me (1977). In 1979 Wilson became executive producer of the film Moonraker and since has been an executive producer or producer in every James Bond film, currently co-producing with his half-sister Barbara. ; Cameo Roles : * Goldfinger (1964) – soldier at Fort Knox (uncredited) * The Spy Who Loved Me (1977) – audience member at pyramid show (uncredited) * Moonraker (1979) – tourist in Venice; NASA technician (uncredited) * For Your Eyes Only (1981) – priest at Greek wedding (uncredited) * Octopussy (1983) – member of Soviet Security Council; tourist on river boat in India (uncredited) * A View to a Kill (1985) – voice heard when Bond enters San Francisco city hall (uncredited) * The Living Daylights (1987) – audience member at Vienna Opera House (uncredited) * Licence to Kill (1989) – voice of DEA agent in pre-title sequence \\"If they hurry, they might just be able to grab the bastard\\" (uncredited) * GoldenEye (1995) – member of Russian Security Council (uncredited) * Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) – Tom Wallace, Carver employee, appearing in video conference scene \\"Consider him slimed\\" (uncredited) * The World Is Not Enough (1999) – employee in Baku casino scene (uncredited) * Die Another Day (2002) – General Chandler (credited); tourist leaning against car in Havana (uncredited) * Casino Royale (2006) – corrupt Montenegrin police chief (credited) * Quantum of Solace (2008) – Man sitting in green armchair in Haitian hotel lobby (uncredited) * Skyfall (2012) – Pallbearer at the funeral of MI6 agents (scene cut from final film) * Spectre (2015) – Government official seen discussing positive result of Nine Eyes vote with Max Denbigh (C), alongside his son Gregg Wilson in his first cameo appearance. =Walter Gotell= A German-British actor, Walter Gotell is known for his role as General Gogol, head of the KGB, in the Bond films. Gotell won the role of General Alexis Gogol in The Spy Who Loved Me for being a look-alike of the former head of Soviet secret police Lavrentiy Beria. His first role in the James Bond films came in 1963, when he played the henchman Morzeny in From Russia with Love. Starting in the late 1970s, he played the recurring role of General Gogol in the James Bond series, beginning with The Spy Who Loved Me in 1977.

His best performance as a striker came in 1999 while playing for Cerro Porteño, as he was the top scorer for the Copa Libertadores 1999 of the same year with 6 goals and the Paraguayan 1st Division topscorer with 22 goals. Today defends the colors of Treze club of soccer of the city of Campina Grande in the State of Paraiba, in Brazilian championship of 2009 Series D  Biography  Gauchinho was born in small Selbach situated in the North part of the State of Rio Grande Do Sul, in day 7 May 1976, Brazil.  Early Life  Paulo Roberto Junges, or simply Gauchinho for the Selbachenses, always had as passion to play soccer and as dream to defend the colors of a great team. It did not measure efforts for the accomplishment of this dream. “Since the four years, it did not change the ball for nothing” as its Ilária mother said. In 1991 to the 15 years the dream of if becoming a football player started to materialize. It passed for the tests played in children-youth of Sport Club Internacional of Porto Alegre where he played for more than a year. In the year of 1992 moved to Tuna Luso of the city of Belém of the State of Pará, where he played in the basic categories by the year 1995 when awakened interest of big clubs in Brazil. It was loaned to São Paulo to participate in the tournament Copa São Paulo de Juniores. The technical team of junior, Dario Pereyra was with the team ready, so he had no chance to play, returned to the home club and signed the first professional contract.  Professional career  Gauchinho began work as a professional for 20 years when it belonged to the cast of junior, in Brazilian championship of 1996 – Series B at the time it was called the Second Division defending Tuna Luso of Belém in 3 games and scored 5 goals. In 1997, his contract was negotiated the entrepreneur Sergio Malucelli Luiz and transferred to Iraty Sport Club of the State of Paraná. This year disputed the Regional Championship of the State of Paraná, and was the highlight of this team. The success earned him a transfer to the team of Paraná – PR for the dispute of Brazilian championship of soccer 1997 – Series A. Playing by the Paraná Club scored 12 goals, almost half of the 30 goals marked by the team this year in the Brazilian Championship of Soccer of the Series A. In 1998 it transferred to the staff of team XV November of the City Piracicaba in the State of São Paulo. disputed for this team Brazilian championship of 1998 – Series B. It was the greatest striker of the competition with 16 goals. In 1999 Gauchinho has achieved an old dream, to participate of an international championship. For Cerro Porteno of Paraguay, participated and got great success in Copa Libertadores 1999, was one of the highlights of this competition and ballers up with 6 goals. Beyond the excellent participation in the Copa Libertadores 1999 . Was champion of the Clausura Tournament – National Championship in Paraguay in 1999. It was the greatest striker of the tournament with 14 goals, greatest striker Apertura Tournament that same year with 12 goals. That year was also the South American tournament for clubs and made 1 goal. In 2000 it had its bigger jump in the career, when defended Gremio – RS, however disputed with Ronaldinho Gaúcho a vacant in the attack, did not have great chances and finished leaving. In 2001 played in four major football clubs of Brazil. Started in Atletico – PR after few games was to dispute Regional Championship of the State São Paulo, for Botafogo – SP which has important and decisive goals that led the team to end the tournament won by Corinthians.

University of Hamburg. last change: 31 July 2003 Osmosis can be made to do work. Osmotic pressure is defined as the external pressure required to be applied so that there is no net movement of solvent across the membrane. Osmotic pressure is a colligative property, meaning that the osmotic pressure depends on the molar concentration of the solute but not on its identity. Osmosis is a vital process in biological systems, as biological membranes are semipermeable. In general, these membranes are impermeable to large and polar molecules, such as ions, proteins, and polysaccharides, while being permeable to non-polar or hydrophobic molecules like lipids as well as to small molecules like oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and nitric oxide. Permeability depends on solubility, charge, or chemistry, as well as solute size. Water molecules travel through the plasma membrane, tonoplast membrane (vacuole) or protoplast by diffusing across the phospholipid bilayer via aquaporins (small transmembrane proteins similar to those responsible for facilitated diffusion and ion channels). Osmosis provides the primary means by which water is transported into and out of cells. The turgor pressure of a cell is largely maintained by osmosis across the cell membrane between the cell interior and its relatively hypotonic environment.

The word \\"osmosis\\" descends from the words \\"endosmose\\" and \\"exosmose\\", which were coined by French physician René Joachim Henri Dutrochet (1776–1847) from the Greek words ἔνδον (éndon \\"within\\"), ἔξω (éxō \\"outer, external\\"), and ὠσμός (ōsmós \\"push, impulsion\\").Etymology of \\"osmosis\\" : * Henri Dutrochet, L'Agent Immédiat du Movement Vital Dévoilé dans sa Nature et dans son Mode d'Action chez les Végétaux et chez les Animaux [The immediate agent of living movement, its nature and mode of action revealed in plants and animals] (Paris, France: Dentu, 1826), pp. 115 and 126. * The intermediate word \\"osmose\\" and the word \\"osmotic\\" were coined by Scottish chemist Thomas Graham. See: Thomas Graham (1854) \\"VII. The Bakerian Lecture – On Osmotic Force,\\" Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society (London), vol. 144, pp. 177–288; see especially pp. 177, 178, and 227. See also: Thomas Graham and Henry Watts, Elements of Chemistry: Including the Applications of the Sciences in the Arts, 2nd ed. (London, England: Hippolyte Bailliere, 1858), vol. 2, p. 616. * The word \\"osmosis\\" first appeared in: Jabez Hogg, The Microscope: Its History, Construction, and Application..., 6th ed. (London, England: George Routledge and Sons, 1867), p. 226. * The etymology of the word \\"osmosis\\" is discussed in: In 1867, Moritz Traube invented highly selective precipitation membranes, advancing the art and technique of measurement of osmotic flow. Mechanism Osmosis is the movement of a solvent across a semipermeable membrane toward a higher concentration of solute (lower concentration of solvent). In biological systems, the solvent is typically water, but osmosis can occur in other liquids, supercritical liquids, and even gases. When a cell is submerged in water, the water molecules pass through the cell membrane from an area of low solute concentration to high solute concentration. For example, if the cell is submerged in saltwater, water molecules move out of the cell. If a cell is submerged in freshwater, water molecules move into the cell. Water passing through a semi-permeable membrane When the membrane has a volume of pure water on both sides, water molecules pass in and out in each direction at exactly the same rate. There is no net flow of water through the membrane. The mechanism responsible for driving osmosis has commonly been represented in biology and chemistry texts as either the dilution of water by solute (resulting in lower concentration of water on the higher solute concentration side of the membrane and therefore a diffusion of water along a concentration gradient) or by a solute's attraction to water (resulting in less free water on the higher solute concentration side of the membrane and therefore net movement of water toward the solute). Both of these notions have been conclusively refuted. The diffusion model of osmosis is rendered untenable by the fact that osmosis can drive water across a membrane toward a higher concentration of water. The \\"bound water\\" model is refuted by the fact that osmosis is independent of the size of the solute molecules—a colligative property—or how hydrophilic they are. It is hard to describe osmosis without a mechanical or thermodynamic explanation, but essentially there is an interaction between the solute and water that counteracts the pressure that otherwise free solute molecules would exert. One fact to take note of is that heat from the surroundings is able to be converted into mechanical energy (water rising). Many thermodynamic explanations go into the concept of chemical potential and how the function of the water on the solution side differs from that of pure water due to the higher pressure and the presence of the solute counteracting such that the chemical potential remains unchanged. The virial theorem demonstrates that attraction between the molecules (water and solute) reduces the pressure, and thus the pressure exerted by water molecules on each other in solution is less than in pure water, allowing pure water to \\"force\\" the solution until the pressure reaches equilibrium. Osmotic pressure is the main cause of support in many plants. The osmotic entry of water raises the turgor pressure exerted against the cell wall, until it equals the osmotic pressure, creating a steady state. When a plant cell is placed in a solution that is hypertonic relative to the cytoplasm, water moves out of the cell and the cell shrinks. In doing so, the cell becomes flaccid. In extreme cases, the cell becomes plasmolyzed – the cell membrane disengages with the cell wall due to lack of water pressure on it. When a plant cell is placed in a solution that is hypotonic relative to the cytoplasm, water moves into the cell and the cell swells to become turgid. Osmosis is responsible for the ability of plant roots to draw water from the soil. Plants concentrate solutes in their root cells by active transport, and water enters the roots by osmosis. Osmosis is also responsible for controlling the movement of guard cells. Osmosis can be demonstrated when potato slices are added to a high salt solution. The water from inside the potato moves out to the solution, causing the potato to shrink and to lose its 'turgor pressure'. The more concentrated the salt solution, the bigger the difference in size and weight of the potato slice. In unusual environments, osmosis can be very harmful to organisms. For example, freshwater and saltwater aquarium fish placed in water of a different salinity than that to which they are adapted to will die quickly, and in the case of saltwater fish, dramatically. Another example of a harmful osmotic effect is the use of table salt to kill leeches and slugs. Suppose an animal or a plant cell is placed in a solution of sugar or salt in water. # If the medium is hypotonic relative to the cell cytoplasm — the cell will gain water through osmosis. # If the medium is isotonic — there will be no net movement of water across the cell membrane. # If the medium is hypertonic relative to the cell cytoplasm — the cell will lose water by osmosis. Essentially, this means that if a cell is put in a solution which has a solute concentration higher than its own, it will shrivel, and if it is put in a solution with a lower solute concentration than its own, the cell will swell and may even burst. Chemical gardens demonstrate the effect of osmosis in inorganic chemistry. Factors=Osmotic pressure= As mentioned before, osmosis may be opposed by increasing the pressure in the region of high solute concentration with respect to that in the low solute concentration region. The force per unit area, or pressure, required to prevent the passage of water (or any other high-liquidity solution) through a selectively permeable membrane and into a solution of greater concentration is equivalent to the osmotic pressure of the solution, or turgor. Osmotic pressure is a colligative property, meaning that the property depends on the concentration of the solute, but not on its content or chemical identity. =Osmotic gradient= The osmotic gradient is the difference in concentration between two solutions on either side of a semipermeable membrane, and is used to tell the difference in percentages of the concentration of a specific particle dissolved in a solution. Usually the osmotic gradient is used while comparing solutions that have a semipermeable membrane between them allowing water to diffuse between the two solutions, toward the hypertonic solution (the solution with the higher concentration). Eventually, the force of the column of water on the hypertonic side of the semipermeable membrane will equal the force of diffusion on the hypotonic (the side with a lesser concentration) side, creating equilibrium. When equilibrium is reached, water continues to flow, but it flows both ways in equal amounts as well as force, therefore stabilizing the solution. Variation=Reverse osmosis= Reverse osmosis is a separation process that uses pressure to force a solvent through a semi- permeable membrane that retains the solute on one side and allows the pure solvent to pass to the other side, forcing it from a region of high solute concentration through a membrane to a region of low solute concentration by applying a pressure in excess of the osmotic pressure. =Forward osmosis= Osmosis may be used directly to achieve separation of water from a solution containing unwanted solutes. A \\"draw\\" solution of higher osmotic pressure than the feed solution is used to induce a net flow of water through a semi- permeable membrane, such that the feed solution becomes concentrated as the draw solution becomes dilute. The diluted draw solution may then be used directly (as with an ingestible solute like glucose), or sent to a secondary separation process for the removal of the draw solute. This secondary separation can be more efficient than a reverse osmosis process would be alone, depending on the draw solute used and the feedwater treated. Forward osmosis is an area of ongoing research, focusing on applications in desalination, water purification, water treatment, food processing, and other areas of study.

The hiccup is an involuntary action involving a reflex arc. Once triggered, the reflex causes a strong contraction of the diaphragm followed about a quarter of a second later by closure of the vocal cords, which results in the \\"hic\\" sound. Hiccups may occur individually, or they may occur in bouts. The rhythm of the hiccup, or the time between hiccups, tends to be relatively constant. A bout of hiccups generally resolves itself without intervention, although many home remedies are often used to attempt to shorten the duration. Medical treatment is occasionally necessary in cases of chronic hiccups.  Signs and symptoms  A hiccup consists of a single or a series of breathing diaphragm spasms, of variable spacing and duration, and a brief (less than one half second), unexpected, shoulder, abdomen, throat, or full body tremor. Hiccups may present as an audible chirp, squeak, \\"hupp\\", or if controlled, a quick inhaling gasp, sigh, or sniff. They may also present as brief but distracting or painful interruptions in normal breathing, with sudden momentary pain of the throat, chest, or abdomen.  Causes =Pathophysiological causes= * Swallowing air excessively * Gastroesophageal reflux * Hiatal hernia * Rapid eating * Carbonated beverages, alcohol, dry breads, and some spicy foods * Opiate drug use * Laughing too much Hiccups may be triggered by a number of common human conditions. In rare cases, they can be a sign of serious medical problems. Pre-phrenic nucleus irritation of medulla * Kidney failure CNS disorders * Stroke * Multiple sclerosis * Meningitis Nerve damage * Damage to the vagus nerve after surgery Other known associations * Although no clear pathophysiological mechanism has been described, hiccups is known to have been the initial symptom of Plasmodium vivax malaria in at least one documented case. =Evolutionary causes=Clearance of air from stomach One suggestion is that hiccups may have evolved along with other reflexes developed in mammals that allow them to coordinate suckling milk and breathing. Hiccups are only found in mammals, and are most common in infants, becoming rarer as mammals age. This may suggest that they evolved to allow air trapped in the stomach of suckling infants to escape, allowing more milk to be ingested. The hypothesis suggests that the air bubble in the stomach stimulates the sensory limb of the reflex at receptors in the stomach, esophagus and along the diaphragm. This triggers the hiccup, which creates suction in the chest, pulling air from the stomach up and out through the mouth, effectively burping the animal. This theory is supported by the strong tendency for infants to get hiccups, the component of the reflex that suppresses peristalsis in the esophagus, and the existence of hiccups only in milk-drinking mammals. Phylogenetic hypothesis An international respiratory research group composed of members from Canada, France, and Japan proposed that the hiccup is an evolutionary remnant of earlier amphibian respiration. Amphibians such as tadpoles gulp air and water across their gills via a rather simple motor reflex akin to mammalian hiccuping. The motor pathways that enable hiccuping form early during fetal development, before the motor pathways that enable normal lung ventilation form. Thus, the hiccup is evolutionarily antecedent to modern lung respiration. Additionally, this group (C. Straus et al.) points out that hiccups and amphibian gulping are inhibited by elevated CO2 and may be stopped by GABAB receptor agonists, illustrating a possible shared physiology and evolutionary heritage. These proposals may explain why premature infants spend 2.5% of their time hiccuping, possibly gulping like amphibians, as their lungs are not yet fully formed. Fetal intrauterine hiccups are of two types. The physiological type occurs prior to twenty-eight weeks after conception and tend to last five to ten minutes. These hiccups are part of fetal development and are associated with the myelination of the phrenic nerve, which primarily controls the thoracic diaphragm. The phylogeny hypothesis explains how the hiccup reflex might have evolved, and if there is not an explanation it may explain hiccups as an evolutionary remnant, held over from our amphibious ancestors. This hypothesis has been questioned because of the existence of the afferent loop of the reflex, the fact that it does not explain the reason for glottic closure, and because the very short contraction of the hiccup is unlikely to have a significant strengthening effect on the slow-twitch muscles of respiration. Treatment Hiccups are normally waited out, as any fit of them will usually pass quickly. Folkloric 'cures' for hiccups are common and varied, but no effective standard for stopping hiccups has been documented. Hiccups are treated medically only in severe and persistent (termed \\"intractable\\") cases. Numerous medical remedies exist but no particular treatment is known to be especially effective, generally because of a paucity of high-quality evidence. Many drugs have been used, such as baclofen, chlorpromazine, metoclopramide, gabapentin, and various proton-pump inhibitors. Hiccups that are secondary to some other cause, like gastroesophageal reflux disease or esophageal webs, are dealt with by treating the underlying disorder. The phrenic nerve can be blocked temporarily with injection of 0.5% procaine, or permanently with bilateral phrenicotomy or other forms of surgical destruction. Even this rather drastic treatment does not cure some cases, however. Haloperidol, metoclopramide, and chlorpromazine are used in cases of intractable hiccups. Effective treatment with sedatives often requires a dose that renders the person either unconscious or highly lethargic. Hence, medicating with sedatives is only appropriate short-term, as the affected individual cannot continue with normal life activities while under their effect. A vagus nerve stimulator has been used with an intractable case of hiccups. \\"It sends rhythmic bursts of electricity to the brain by way of the vagus nerve, which passes through the neck. The Food and Drug Administration approved the vagus nerve stimulator in 1997 as a way to control seizures in some patients with epilepsy.\\" Persistent digital rectal massage has also been proven effective in terminating intractable hiccups. = Folk remedies = There are many superstitious and folk remedies for hiccups, including headstanding, drinking a glass of water upside-down, being frightened by someone, breathing into a bag, eating a large spoonful of peanut butter and placing sugar on or under the tongue. A simple treatment involves increasing the partial pressure of CO2 and inhibiting diaphragm activity by holding one’s breath or rebreathing into a paper bag. Other potential remedies suggested by NHS Choices include pulling your knees up to your chest and leaning forward, sipping ice-cold water and swallowing some granulated sugar. Society and culture The word hiccup itself was created through imitation. The alternative spelling of hiccough results from the incorrect assumption that it originates from the word cough. American Charles Osborne had hiccups for 68 years, from 1922 to February 1990,In pictures  Guinness medical record breakers  Longest attack of hiccups. BBC News. Retrieved on 2 June 2013. and was entered in the Guinness World Records as the man with the longest attack of hiccups, an estimated 430 million hiccups. In 2007, Florida teenager Jennifer Mee gained media fame for hiccuping around 50 times per minute for more than five weeks. Christopher Sands, a Briton, hiccupped an estimated 10 million times in a 27-month period from February 2007 to May 2009. His condition, which meant that he could hardly eat or sleep, was eventually discovered to be caused by a tumor on his brain stem pushing on nerves causing him to hiccup every two seconds, 12 hours a day. His hiccups stopped in 2009 following surgery. In Slavic, Baltic, German, Hungarian, Turkish, Romanian and Indian folklore it is said that hiccups occur when the person experiencing them is being talked about by someone not present.

Hodder & Stoughton) The Spring Madness of Mr. Sermon is a 1963 novel by R. F. Delderfield. It was published in the United States in 1970 as Mr. Sermon. Plot summary At the age of 49, schoolmaster Sebastian Sermon has become vaguely dissatisfied with his life. Distant from his wealthy, ten- years-younger wife, Sybil, and teenage children, he works competently at his ill-paid job at a boys' preparatory school. One spring afternoon, he reacts to a schoolboy prank by repeatedly hitting the perpetrator. The headmaster hears the commotion and breaks things up. The headmaster is willing to hush things up, but Sermon defends himself, throws up his job and goes home. Rebuffed by his wife sexually (though she immediately regrets it), he takes a few belongings, and sets out, he knows not where. He takes a bus to London and then a train to the West Country. He meets up with a junk/antique dealer, Tapper, on the road and helps him out with his trade (for which Sermon proves to have quite a knack), and goes with him to the fictitious upscale Devon seaside resort of Kingsbay. Sermon captivates several women, first a barmaid, and then his Kingsbay landlady, Olga Boxall. When Sermon and Boxall take a bus excursion, and when the bus driver is injured, Sermon must drive the bus back to Kingsbay. That evening, the two have sex—and Boxall, who has long figured out that Sermon is married, leaves the next day on a trip to give the two time to figure out if they are right for each other, while renting her house to Sermon. Sermon saves a little girl from drowning, whose nanny (who is immediately discharged) is a young woman he's met before in his time at Kingsbay and in fact briefly taught at his school. The woman, Rachel Grey, proves to be the daughter of the headmaster of Barrowdene, a (fictitious) highly regarded public school near to Kingsbay. She brings him to the school to meet her father, and Sermon and Headmaster Fred Grey hit it off, while Sermon feels very much at home at the school. Upon his return from the school, Sermon finds a policeman waiting for him—his using a cheque to pay for the rent has alerted Sybil to his location. Sermon tells the policeman that he will mail a letter to his wife, which he does. Sermon's heroics bring him to the attention of the town authorities, who hire him to supervise the various public works by the shore, including the pay toilets, and he gets the Town Clerk to hire Rachel Grey to run the small zoo. Sermon's summer settles into a routine; days supervising foreshore operations with lunch with Rachel Grey, Saturdays at Barrowdene, Sunday running the antique shop. Things are rudely interrupted when Sermon, rescuing a woman from a pay toilet with a jammed lock, finds his wife and daughter staring at him. He has lunch with his wife, and says they need to make a new start in someplace like Kingsbay. Sybil is taken aback by Sermon's new confidence, but is unwilling to move from the London area. She returns home with her daughter. Rachel Grey, who observed part of the tête à tête between the spouses, later behaves sexually provocatively towards Sermon. Sermon, fearing the effect both on his relationship with her, and with Fred Grey, does not take up the invitation. Sermon returns to his routine, now and then teaching a class or two at Barrowdene. The Headmaster offers Sermon a job teaching at Barrowdene, and gives him time to think about it, telling Sermon that his prospects would be much brighter if he could persuade Sybil to join him. Boxall simplifies Sermon's romantic life somewhat by sending a letter indicating that she has become infatuated with another tourist, and later, offering to sell her house. He informs Sybil by phone. She is hostile to the idea, but willing to talk it over if Sermon comes home. In fact, she has a male friend over, Scott-James, who volunteers to go down to Kingsbay and seek evidence towards a divorce. Against her better judgment, Sybil agrees. Scott-James arrives, and takes photographs of Sermon and Rachel in Sermon's Kingsbay house together—for Sermon has had Rachel spend the night (in separate bedrooms) after the two were soaked after a flood at the zoo. When Scott-James introduces himself, and states the purpose of his business, Sermon punches him, and confiscates and burns the film, and, after Scott-James staggers off, Sermon has sex with Rachel. Tired of being ruled by events, Sermon sets out to his home and Sybil. Realizing that he owns the family home, Sermon sells the house to his mother in law, and accepts Boxall's offer to sell her house to him. Sermon confronts his wife and tells her this, and when the enraged Sybil stabs him with nail scissors, he (as suggested by his mother in law) spanks her. This clears the air, and the two reconcile, and consummate their renewed relationship. A short epilogue looks ahead to Sermon's fiftieth birthday. Sermon is immersed in his duties at Barrowdene. Sybil is pregnant with their third child. Fred Gray makes Sermon a housemaster, and Sybil is much more acquiescent to the prospect of moving from Kingsbay to the school grounds than she was about the first move. 1963 British novels Novels by R.

Established for competitive amateur girl soccer players, it currently competes in the Elite Clubs National League, among others. It is the first and oldest all girls' soccer club in the country. History=1970s= Sting was founded in 1973 by Bill Kinder who, with Lamar Hunt and a few key soccer pioneers put together teams of female athletes at the high school age who played in the newly created Dallas league called the High School Girls Soccer League (which became the Lake Highlands Girls Classic League). Players voted to call themselves The Sting, taking the name from the 1973 hit movie starring Robert Redford and Paul Newman.Townsend, Brad, \\"Where it all started: How Dallas-area Sting team paved the way for the United States’ Women’s World Cup team\\" (3 July 2015) In 1976, Sting became the first girls or women's soccer team to travel outside the United States and the first to travel to Mexico. Sting faced Mexico's national champion team in Mexico City, playing before 35,000 fans in Mexico City's Olympic Stadium prior to a division one men's professional match. In 1977, Sting became the first American girls soccer team to play in Europe, playing in Sweden's Gothia Cup and falling to a team from Taiwan in the championship game. In 1978, Sting represented the United States in the first triennial global invitational tournament for national and club teams, the Women's World Invitation Tournament (the Chunghua Cup) in Taipei, Taiwan, tying for third place. When the tournament was held again in 1981, Sting again represented the U.S., playing in front of 45,000 fans and ultimately tying for ninth place. Starting in 1979, Sting added teams in new age groups until they had established a team at every age group level from U11-U19. =1980s= In 1980 at the first-ever United States Youth Soccer Association Women's U19 National Championship, decades after the first men's youth soccer National Amateur Cup. The Sting U19 team won the first-ever national championship, defeating St. Louis 5-0 in the championship match. It went on to win five of the first nine U.S. U19 national titles, including in 1982, 1985, 1987 and 1988, in addition to the 1980 win. Upon finishing the 1981-82 season with 47 wins and 0 losses, Sting's collective nine-year record was 400 wins and just 9 losses. In 1984, Sting was selected by the U.S. Soccer Federation to represent the U.S. in Xi-an, China at the first ever FIFA tournament for women's national teams. Sting faced off against established National Teams from countries all over the world, defeating Australia,Australia women's national soccer team Japan,Japan women's national football team and ChinaChina women's national football team to advance to the finals. Sting beat ItalyItaly women's national football team in the Championship game becoming the first American team, male or female, to win a major international tournament. Sting participated in the largest youth tournament in the world at the time during 1985, playing in the Norway Cup,http://www.norwaycup.no featuring more than 1,500 male and female teams. The team earned 1st place and was chosen as the Team of the Tournament (out of both male and female teams) for their level of professionalism, discipline, and sportsmanlike conduct.

Pearson (1829–1908) of New York state. Anna was a native of Virginia and the only surviving daughter of Eston Hemings Jefferson and his wife Julia Ann Isaacs. Albert worked as a carpenter in Madison; he served as a captain in the Union Army during the war. Walter had an older brother Fred and an older sister Julia. Their mother died prematurely, at the age of 30, when Walter was just four years old. The three children were educated in public schools. Pearson's maternal grandfather Eston Hemings Jefferson was born into slavery at Monticello. Seven-eighths European in ancestry, he was legally white under Virginia law and freed in 1826 by the will of his master (and father) Thomas Jefferson. Julia Ann Isaacs, a free woman of color, was of African, European-American and German-Jewish descent. They moved their family from Ohio to Wisconsin in 1852 for added security after passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. Although all their family was free, slave catchers often kidnapped and enslaved free blacks in those years, as well as capturing fugitive slaves.Carol Wilson, Freedom at Risk: The Kidnapping of Free Blacks in America, 1780–1865, University of Kentucky Press, 1994. The historian Carol Wilson documented 300 such cases in her book, and noted there were likely thousands more. In 1852 the Hemings family had changed their surname to Jefferson and entered the white community in Madison, Wisconsin. Anna Jefferson was 16 that year.Justus, Judith, Down from the Mountain: The Oral History of the Hemings Family Lesher Printers, Inc., 1999, pp. 90–96 Both Anna and her brother Beverly Jefferson married white spouses, and all their descendants have identified as white. Career Pearson had gone into business in Chicago. By the late 19th century, he operated a small manufacturing company that made screws and developed technology which made his company valuable enough to sell to Standard Screw (based in Connecticut) in 1900. When appointed as president in 1904, Pearson soon doubled the company's subsidiaries from four to eight, increasing their skilled workforce and facilities. He led Standard Screw Company to dominance in the industry through the early twentieth century. Together with two other leaders, Pearson introduced the \\" 'new Standard Automatic,' a machine that reduced the cost of making screws nearly 40 percent.\\" In 1904 he reduced prices, which gave the company an edge with the new auto manufacturers, whose rapid expansion as an industry fed Standard's profits. The coming of World War I led to a major increase in profits, as Pearson won contracts from the British and US governments for bullets and fuses. The 1916 profit was 10 times higher than the previous year, and returns increased by 340 percent in 1917. Pearson had established a dominance among companies that manufactured screw machine products; his skilled shops could make complex parts for many different industries, and held the edge for decades. Pearson was described as the company's \\"first outstanding leader.\\"\\"Stanadyne Automotive Corporation\\", Gale Directory of Company Histories, 2006, Answers.com, accessed 14 June 2012 Marriage and family Walter Pearson married Helena Snyder (her name was later anglicized to Helen; born in Illinois, she was the daughter of German immigrants.)

Provo, UT, USA At his death in 1917, Pearson left an estate valued at $2,000,000. The executors of his will were his wife Helen and his cousin Carl Jefferson, the son of his maternal uncle Beverly Jefferson. Pearson left a $50,000 annuity to his wife, $12,000 annuities to his daughter Beatrice and son Frederick, and a $50,000 bequest to his cousin Frederick Jefferson. Pearson's son Frederick was to receive $2 million, the bulk of the Pearson fortune, on his 35th birthday. In 1920, the widow Helen Pearson and her children were living in Miami, Florida.

He died in Chicago at age 30 on February 20, 1926 in a fire at the Claridge Hotel. After a night of heavy drinking with friends; he had fallen asleep smoking a cigarette and a fire started in his room. By the time it was discovered, he could not be saved.\\"Heir to $2,000,000 Fortune Burned to Death\\", New York Times, February 21, 1926, accessed 20 March 2011 Beatrice was a semi-invalid at the time of her brother's death and never married. Pearson has no known descendants. Family In 1974 the historian Fawn McKay Brodie published a biography of Thomas Jefferson in which she explored the evidence related to his alleged relationship with Sally Hemings. Her book Thomas Jefferson: An Intimate History (1974) noted that Jefferson was in residence at Monticello for the conception period of each of Hemings' children, and that Sally Hemings never conceived when he was not there. Her book met mixed reactions: excellent reviews from literary critics and opposition to her psychological approach and conclusions about Jefferson's paternity from mainline biographers of the president. After she published her biography, descendants of Carl Jefferson (a grandson of Eston Hemings Jefferson) read it and contacted her. Their knowledge of the family connection to Thomas Jefferson had been lost in the 1940s, as the Jefferson brothers decided not to pass on the story, for fear their children would face racial discrimination because of descent from the slave Sally Hemings. The senior Jeffersons instead told their children that they were descended from an uncle of Jefferson. In 1976 Brodie published an article in American Heritage magazine about the grandchildren of Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson, and covered the Pearson family. A 1998 DNA study found that a male descendant of Eston Hemings Jefferson matched the rare Y-chromosome of the Jefferson male line. Most historians took this result as affirming other historical evidence related to the paternity issue, and have acknowledged that the president and Sally Hemings had a 38-year relationship in which he fathered her six children of record. While some historians disagree, most Jeffersonian scholarship has changed to incorporate this. Pearson and his Jefferson cousins were great- grandchildren of Thomas Jefferson. As the Monticello Website says: > Through his celebrity as the eloquent spokesman for liberty and equality as > well as the ancestor of people living on both sides of the color line, > Jefferson has left a unique legacy for descendants of Monticello's enslaved > people as well as for all Americans.\\"The Legacies of Monticello\\", Getting > Word, Monticello, accessed 19 March 2011 In 2012 the Smithsonian and Monticello collaborated on an exhibit entitled Slavery at Jefferson's Monticello: The Paradox of Liberty, which explored several slave families and their descendants, including the Hemingses.

It was made by Paramount Pictures. The screenplay was written by Ken Englund, Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse. Plot The story starts off with Joan Bennett playing Patricia Harper, the heiress daughter of a billionaire oil tycoon, James Harper, having dinner with Mrs. Isabel Channing and Elliott Winthrop, whom Mrs. Channing wants Patricia to marry. Caught up in Mrs. Channing's need to behave ‘proper’ Patricia expresses her wish to live a normal life and enjoy simple mundane things. Elliott announces his promotion as U.S. ambassador to France. He is then called away to the consulate to handle a problem at the gate. This is where Elliott meets the American dance troupe, led by Buck Boswell (Jack Benny), asking for an emergency fare back to the U.S. Elliott declares that there is no such contingency in the budget for such an occasion (or else no one would buy a return flight home) and wishes them luck before, presumably, returning to dinner. Buck then promises the troupe that he'll get them back and brings them to an expensive hotel on the premise that they don't have the money to pay for it regardless so they might as well live it up. Upon their arrival, Buck and The Yacht Club Boys (named Swifty, Dopey, Jimmy, and Kelly in the film) convince the owner of the hotel that they have money and are used to paying at the end of their stay instead of the beginning. The owner, mesmerized by the thought that all Americans have money, allows them to move into their rooms, against the will of his wife. However the next day, while the troupe is practising their cowboy & Indians routine, the hotel owner's wife locks them out of their rooms, and in order for their rooms to be unlocked she insists that they pay their bill. To get their belongings back, the girls push the guys to go out and find jobs. Buck receives 5 francs from one of the girls, the last 5 francs to the name of any troupe member. Walking down the street, Buck is called on by Patricia Harper, who recognizes him as American by his cowboy outfit. She tells him that she has left her money in her hotel room and asks him to cover the 3 franc bill for her breakfast, which he does. Then, thinking she's a scammer who also has not a penny to her name, he invites her to act with his troupe. Seeking adventure as a normal person, Patricia keeps her wealth a secret and plays along. They go back to the hotel, and Patricia pretends to be suicidal to lure the staff to the roof, so the troupe can grab the keys to get their belongings from their rooms. After this, the staff wises up and calls the police on the troupe, joined by Patricia's’ father, who found her after she let Mrs. Channing know she wasn't coming home. The troupe is now forced to climb through the window and climb to another building, in order to escape the police. Still running from the police, they manage to hide out in an old studio full of mannequins that they think is abandoned. After evading the police by posing as mannequins, they decide to spend the night. Upon waking up, they hear people talking. Thinking it's the police, they prepare to run. Overhearing a producer's conversation, Buck realizes that it's a theater that's putting on a show. Buck runs into another troupe from Russia, that then thinks he is the producer. He turns them away, and his troupe takes the Russians' place. After rehearsals, Patricia's father sees the royal jewels in a case and asks if he can buy them, not realizing what they are. After being declined he steals them before the troupe leaves. This leads to a mad hunt for the jewel thieves. Patricia's father has a copy of the jewels made for Patricia, as a present. The jewels get mixed up when Patricia's father shows them to Ms. Channing. Buck is back at Patricia's father's hotel, where he planned on gifting the replica necklace to her. He hides it, but Buck finds it while snooping around, suspicious of her father. There is a knock on the door, and a mad scramble to leave the hotel room. While this is going on, Buck stays behind and is introduced to a man while the troupe is running away because they think it's the police still after them. The man turns out to be an oil magnate to whom Patricia's father plans to sell his oil, and Buck, thinking that the old man is running a scam on the oil magnate, rips up the contract. Buck then becomes wise and tells the troupe that he'll get them home by returning the jewels, so that either the French will be grateful and give them the fare home, or will think they stole it and deport them. The French lock him and the troupe up, but upon realizing the jewels were a replica, they let Buck go, and send people to follow him. Buck goes to confront Patricia and her father, who are out at dinner with Elliot and Ms. Channing. There is a struggle, and the jewels get stuck on the roof. After retrieving them, they are all arrested. Back at the police station, everyone's real identity is revealed. Everyone is released, and Buck & Patricia get married. Cast *Jack Benny as Buck Boswell *Joan Bennett as Patricia Harper * Mary Boland as Mrs. Isabel Channing * Charley Grapewin as James Harper * Fritz Feld as Dubois * Yacht Club Boys Production According to the Production Encyclopedia,Production Encyclopedia 1952 Paramount started production in 1937. In the Spanish magazine Cine--Mundial it is mentioned that in one of the pool scenes they used foam instead of water in order to prevent the actresses from getting sick. In the Paramount International News volume 5 no. 5 in May 1938, Mary Boland and Joan Bennett were added to the film whose name was confirmed as \\"Artists & Models Abroad\\". In volume 5 no. 6 in June 1938, Jean Sablon, French singer, was added to the cast for a specialty number. In July 1938, the cast was augmented and Evelyn Keys was brought in to play Marie Antoinette in a beauty pageant. Promotion This being a sequel to the successful Artists & Models, Paramount promoted this film heavily for its holiday release. This included several interviews and articles published months in advance of the film's release. They even got the National Board of Review Magazine to give it a classification of ‘Movies worth an audience's patronage’. Among print ads put up in newspapers and journals, they also had radio ads for the film according to a Dec 1938 article in The Film Daily. The whole premise of its advertising campaign was that the best gift you could give for the holidays was a ticket to see this movie. There were a few interviews in Photoplay Magazine with the famous designer Edith Head who was in charge of designing the clothes for Joan Bennett to wear in the film. Several posters were made for the film, some of which are in different languages including Spanish. The film was marketing to multiple regions & Spanish magazines reviewed the film. Advertising was heavily marketed to fashion-conscious women. Reception The U. S. theatrical release of the film was on December 20, 1938. The film opened at the Paramount theater in NYC where it played at capacity over the holidays, according to a December 1938 article in The Film Daily. There were many reviews of this film ahead of its release on December 20. \\"Watch this clean up at the box office with its appeal both to the femmes and the men.\\" - The Film Daily (pre-release) \\"Mass Entertainment at its best\\"- Motion Picture Herald (pre-release) Upon its initial release at the Paramount, the reviews were mixed. \\"Few came to see it, less liked the show\\" - H.

Founding and inaugural season  In 1914, Jess and Ed McMahon, brothers who had previously founded the Lincoln Giants, formed the Lincoln Stars.Riley, pp. 484, 539–540. In the team's first summer, its roster included second baseman William Parks, left fielder Jap Payne, power-hitting first baseman Bill Pettus, and catcher Bill Pierce.Riley, pp. 604, 610–611, 622–623, 626. In the fall of 1914, the Lincoln Stars toured Cuba. A number of players were recruited from the Lincoln Giants, including manager and center fielder Spottswood Poles, pitchers Dick Redding and Dizzy Dismukes, catcher Louis Santop, and left fielder Jules Thomas. In 14 games played against Habana and Almendares between October 9 and November 2, the Stars won 4, lost 9, and tied 1. Researcher Gary Ashwill has tabulated complete statistics for 13 of the 14 games. In a pitching-dominated series, the Stars' top hitters in these games were Poles, who hit .313, and Santop, who hit .289. Redding had 2 wins and 3 losses with a 2.59 total run average and 32 hits, 17 walks, and 27 strikeouts in 48⅔ innings pitched. Both of Redding's wins were shutouts—a 4-hit, 1–0 victory over Habana on October 15 and a 3-hit, 3–0 win over the same team on October 19.  1915 season  The 1915 team was regarded as perhaps the strongest black team in the East.Holway, p. 105; Riley, p. 484. The team comprised Redding and Doc Sykes as pitchers, Pierce as catcher, Pettus at first base, Bill Kindle at second base, Sam Mongin at third base, John Henry Lloyd at shortstop, Jude Gans in left field, Poles in center field, and Santop in right field and as backup catcher.Clark and Lester, p. 67; Holway, p. 106. They played a championship series against the Chicago American Giants, but the series ended in controversy. Each team won five games, and the deciding eleventh game was called in the fourth inning with the Stars ahead by a run, but the game was never completed or replayed.Riley, p. 484. After the series, Lloyd and Gans jumped the Stars to rejoin the American Giants.Riley, pp. 302, 487.  1916 season  The 1916 Lincoln Stars again were one of the strongest teams in the East. This season has the most complete statistics of any of their seasons, based on league statistics compiled by Ashwill. The Stars played 23 known games against major Negro league opponents. Their overall record was 10–13, with a 5–3 record against Eastern opponents and 5–10 against Western teams. The Stars' roster consisted of pitchers Sykes, Gunboat Thompson, and Ad Langford, catcher Santop, first baseman Pettus, second baseman C. Johnston, third baseman Lee Miller, shortstop Parks, left fielder Ashby Dunbar, center fielders Bruce Hocker and Oscar Charleston, and right fielder Peter Green. Statistics for individual players were compiled from box scores for 18 of their games. Their top hitters were Pettus, who hit .408, Santop (.318), Parks (.311), Charleston (.308), and Dunbar (.294). The highlight of their season was another championship series against the Chicago American Giants, 7 games played from August 6 through August 18. Just before the series, Oscar Charleston jumped the team to rejoin the Indianapolis ABCs, with whom he had played the previous season. Despite the absence of Charleston, the Stars took a 3–2 lead in the series, but then lost the last two games.  Demise during 1917 season  The 1917 Stars team failed to finish the season. Many of the players moved on to play with the Pennsylvania Red Caps of New York.Clark and Lester, pp. 71–72.

Utah leads the series 79–29–4. For much of its history, whenever the two teams played in Salt Lake City, it was held on Thanksgiving Day. However, this aspect of the rivalry ended in 1958. Since 1959, no meeting has been played on Thanksgiving Day; and more recently, the meeting has been held in September as one of the first games of the season for both teams. Utah and Utah State have not competed in the same conference since 1961, meaning each meeting since then has been a voluntary non-conference game. In the 1970s, Utah and its fans turned their sights towards Brigham Young University as their biggest rival, and the Holy War became the main rivalry in the state of Utah. Following the Utes' 2015 win, no further meetings have been scheduled, and it is unclear when the rivalry will resume. It is the oldest contest in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of NCAA Division I college football, between two public universities, in the same state, that have a game named \\"University of _ vs. _ State University.\\" Game results Until 1957, the Aggies were known as the Utah State Agricultural College, or Utah A.C.

Since the late 1990s, it has been cultivated in North Carolina as a specialty crop and has increased in popularity in recent years. A sprite melon has a round shape and is typically about the size of a grapefruit. It generally ranges in weight from 1.0 to 1.5 lbs. The flesh of a sprite melon is ivory in color and firm, while the peel ranges from ivory (unripe) to yellowish (ripe). As the melon reaches optimal ripeness, horizontal brown markings will appear near the stem. Sprite melon contains seeds. The firm, juicy, sweet flesh of the sprite melon is usually eaten for dessert and tends to resemble the flavor of both pears and honeydew, however it is much sweeter than either of these and can often consist of 18% sugar (25% to 30% more than other melons). The melon is a part of the family Cucurbitaceae, grouped in with cucumbers, gourds, and pumpkins.

He started his career in a variety of companies where his analytical skills were valuable. Based on his work at the North Eastern Railway Company, he published a book on railway rates. In 1907, he was chosen to chair a commission to reorganize the British Columbia civil service. His interest in calendar reform began when he was working at a railroad company. He found that monthly accounting was greatly complicated by the fact that months did not divide evenly into weeks. He devised what is now known as the International Fixed Calendar, a solar calendar in which each of 13 months has 28 days. In 1922, he founded the International Fixed Calendar League in an effort to gain adoption of his calendar by businesses and government. American entrepreneur George Eastman adopted the calendar for use in his Eastman Kodak Company, where it was used from 1928 to 1982. Later in life Cotsworth moved to British Columbia. He died in Vancouver. Legacy and honors Cotsworth was elected as a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, of the Royal Statistical Society, and of the Geological Society.

Libertad was named an Ambassador for Peace by UNESCO, Comendadora by the Peruvian government, a member of the Order of Rio Branco by the Brazilian government, among other honors. In 2009, she received the Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award for musical excellence. With more than 44 albums and sales of over 12 million copies, her work is widely known throughout the Americas, Europe and Africa.http://localmusicvibe.com/show/tania- libertad-50th-anniversary She has performed concerts in France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Holland, England, Morocco, Angola, Senegal, the United States, Peru, Ecuador, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Uruguay, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Panama, El Salvador, Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. The year 2012 marked 50 years as a performer with two sold-out performances at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City, launching a tour throughout Latin America. Early life Tania Libertad in concert at the Feria Internacional de Libro in Guadalajara in November 2005 Libertad was born in Zaña, a small town in the Lambayeque Region on the coast of northern Peru and was raised in the regional capital of Chiclayo. Her mother was a nurse of indigenous descent, and her father was a policeman of Portuguese descent with very traditional views on gender roles. She grew up with eight older brothers. She found growing up in such a male-dominated environment difficult. She first sang on stage at the age of five in Chiclayo. Because her parents worked long hours, her family didn't know she was singing. In early performances, she sang traditional Peruvian and Mexican songs, including waltzes and boleros. When her father discovered her musical talent, he had her sing songs he had written to his mistresses; she found these songs were of poor quality and helped her distinguish between good and bad music. She further developed her repertoire with traditional and rock music on the radio, and recalls singing in competitions at age seven, knowing 300 boleros by eight, and making records by nine. Career As a teenager, Libertad moved to the Peruvian capital of Lima. She sang in nightclubs there, and her father worked as her manager. She was soon offered a contract with RCA Victor and had her first national hit in Peru, \\"La Contamanina.\\" While Libertad pursued her musical career she convinced her father to let her study engineering in the university. Because her father wanted to study what one of her brothers did, she studied science and engineering in fisheries. She never used this education later in life, but she credits her university experience with exposing her to other people who were interested in art and left-wing politics, especially anti-war movements. During this time, Libertad's interest in Afro-Peruvian music, which flourished in her native north, grew. The nationalist Peruvian government wanted to encourage expressions of Peruvian culture, going so far as to establish an Afro-Peruvian ballet company. She also became uncomfortable singing in nightclubs due to the sexism and racism prevalent there, which motivated her to begin singing socially conscious music in universities and union halls. But as her father became more protective of her as a teenager, he wanted her to give up her musical career, so at the age of 20, she ran away from home and lived with friends for two weeks until her father accepted her desire to sing full-time. Tania Libertad with Los Tigres del Norte on 17 May 2007 In 1976, Libertad began to travel abroad, and was inspired by the musical traditions and political consciousness she encountered in the places she visited, such as Cuba. Unsuccessful in Peru with her new brand of music, she decided to emigrate to Mexico. She arrived there penniless and bonded with Latin American artists who fled their home countries for political reasons. Soon, she found her first job at the Blanquita Theatre in Mexico City. There, Libertad was given a contract by PolyGram singing trova, Afro-Peruvian music, salsa, and bolero. In 1985, she released her first album of boleros. She has lived in Mexico since, and has sung in over 20 countries on every inhabited continent. Tania Libertad sings at the Cultural Festival in Zacatecas on 13 April 2006 During her career, Libertad shared the stage with other international artists such as Mercedes Sosa, Joan Manuel Serrat, Silvio Rodríguez, Pablo Milanés, Alberto Cortez, León Gieco, Juan Carlos Baglietto, Guadalupe Pineda, Chico Buarque, Gal Costa, Alfredo Zitarrosa, Cesária Évora, Vicente Fernández, Eugenia León, Juan Gabriel, Miguel Bosé, Plácido Domingo, Armando Manzanero, Simón Díaz, Willie Colón, Tito Puente, Oscar Chávez, Iván Lins, Ricardo Cocciante, Soledad Pastorutti, Marco Antonio Muñiz, Soledad Bravo, Amália Rodrigues, Susana Rinaldi, Phil Manzanera, Lucha Villa and the group Inti Illimani, among others. The Nobel Prize winning Portuguese author Jose Saramago writes of her work: \\"The first time I heard Tania Libertad sing, it was a revelation from on high - from a place where only a naked voice might go, alone in the world, unaccompanied by any instrument. Tania was singing the Rafael Alberti composition \\"La Paloma\\" a capella, and each note touched a string in my soul until I was completely dazzled.\\" - José Saramago Influences Despite not being of African descent, Libertad is inspired by the Afro-Peruvian music indigenous to the area of Peru in which she was born, an area primarily populated by descendants of African slaves. Her albums Costa Negra and Color Negro, from 2003 and 2004 respectively, are recordings of Afro-Peruvian songs. Her appreciation of Afro-Antillan music has been reflected on works which reference Trova and Nueva canción, and have included arranged renditions to compositions by Silvio Rodriguez. Additionally, she has collaborated with Armando Manzanero. Personal life Libertad is married to a businessman and has a son; they live in Mexico City. She considers herself a citizen of the world, and ascribes to the ideas of Simón Bolívar, especially that Latin America should be a unified body without borders. She identifies as anti-war, but does not like to be labeled a protest singer.

It was formed on 1 May 1948, although it draws its lineage from units that were originally formed in the 1880s. It is currently a Light Cavalry unit equipped with Bushmaster Protected Mobility Vehicles. The regiment forms part of the 11th Brigade, attached to the 2nd Division and draws its members from regional centres in northern New South Wales, hence the reference to the Hunter River. Since 2000 the regiment has provided individuals as reinforcements to round-out Regular Army units deploying overseas on peacekeeping operations and in the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. History The origins of the Hunter River Lancers can be traced back to 1885 when cavalry enthusiasts in Sydney first obtained permission to form a Cavalry troop. Interest soon stirred and shortly thereafter troops were formed in many country areas, one of which was in the Hunter River area. All these Cavalry troops were to some extent independent and were known as the 'Cavalry Reserves'. In 1889 these troops were welded into a Regiment called, 'New South Wales Cavalry Regiment', which was subsequently renamed the 'New South Wales Lancers' in 1894. In June 1897, a volunteer cavalry regiment of bushmen was raised and designated the 'Australian Horse'.Hall 1968, p. 60. Some of the sub units from this regiment were the forerunners of the New England Light Horse (NELH). In 1900, E Squadron was raised from Gunnedah, Boggabri, Tamworth and Armidale and rapidly mobilised a detachment to serve in the South African War. After Federation in January 1901, the colonial military forces were reorganised. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Australian Light Horse Regiments were formed in New South Wales at this time. In 1907, the 1st Australian Light Horse was split to form two regiments: the 1st and 4th, with the 4th assuming the designation of the Hunter River Lancers, while the 2nd Australian Light Horse was split to form the 2nd and 5th New South Wales Mounted Rifles, and the 3rd Australian Light Horse was split to form the 3rd and 6th Australian Horse. In 1912, the 6th Australian Horse became the 5th Light Horse (New England Light Horse), while the 4th Hunter River Lancers became 6th Light Horse (Hunter River Lancers). Each regiment received their own badges and mottoes and remained on the order of battle until 1918. At the outbreak of World War I, new light horse regiments were formed as part of the Australian Imperial Force. Distinct from the Australian Military Forces regiments, they were raised specifically for overseas service. The 5th and 6th Regiments virtually ceased to exist as most of their available manpower joined the AIF. The 12th Light Horse Regiment (AIF) was raised at Liverpool in early 1915 and was deployed as part of the 1st AIF to continue its training in Egypt. Most of its members were from the areas covered by both the 4th and 6th ALH. In July 1915 the regiment trained as infantry in preparation for deployment to Gallipoli. In late August 1915 the regiment departed Egypt to support the ANZAC forces at Gallipoli. Upon landing at Anzac Cove the regiment were split up to reinforce the three other Light Horse regiments from New South Wales (1st, 6th & 7th) already in place. Following the Gallipoli campaign, the regiment was redeployed to Egypt, where it took part in the Sinai campaign of 1916–1917 and the Palestine campaign of 1917–1918. In 1917 the regiment saw extensive service in Palestine where it took part in the Battle of Beersheba, the last great cavalry charge in modern warfare. Following this the regiment continued to be heavily involved in the Palestine campaign until the cessation of hostilities in October 1918. After the war, the designation of the pre-war regiments was altered to maintain the traditions and battle honours of the AIF Light Horse regiments.Grey 2008, p. 125. In 1918, the 5th Light Horse Regiment became the 12th Light Horse Regiment (New England Light Horse), and in 1927 was awarded the battle honours won by the 12th Light Horse Regiment (AIF).Festberg 1972, p. 47. The 6th ALH (HRL) became the 16th Light Horse Regiment (Hunter River Lancers), and was awarded battle honours for the Middle East campaign,Festberg 1972, pp. 49–50. despite never having seen overseas service. This was because many of the members of the regiment had seen active service with other regiments. In 1936, the 12th Light Horse regiment was designated the 12th/24th Light Horse Regiment and then in early 1939 the regiment was split to form the 12th Light Horse Regiment (New England Light Horse) and the 24th Light Horse Regiment (Gwydir Light Horse). The Gwydir Regiment had its headquarters at Moree. With the outbreak of World War II, the 12th and the 16th were called up for one month's training and raised to their war establishment. In early 1940 both regiments attended a three month training activity. Towards the end of 1941 the 12th and the 16th were placed on full-time duty with new designations – the 12th Light Horse Regiment (NELH), was now the 12th Motor Regiment (NELH) (effective 14 March 1942) and the 16th was renamed the 16th Light Horse (Machine Gun) Regiment (HRL) (effective December 1941).Festberg 1972, pp. 47 & 49. In 1942, the 12th Motor Regiment was re-designated as the 12th Australian Armoured Car Regiment (NELH). At the same time 16th Light Horse (Machine Gun) Regiment was re- designated the 16th Motor Regiment (HRL). By 1942, the threat of Japanese invasion had passed and with island warfare not generally suited to armour, it was apparent three Australian armoured divisions, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd, would be disbanded. As a result, on 3 July 1943 the 16th Motor Regiment (HRL) was disbanded and the 12th Australian Armoured Car Regiment (NELH) followed on 19 October 1943, with the last men being marched out in March 1944. However, most of their soldiers from the 12th and 16th were posted to active service in other armoured, anti-tank, field artillery, infantry and service units of the Second Australian Imperial Force. In 1948, the 12th/16th Armoured Regiment (Hunter River Lancers) was raised as part of the new Citizen Military Force (CMF), which replaced the pre-war militia, and it was equipped with Matilda tanks,Hopkins 1978, p. 340. Staghound Armoured Cars and Canadian Scout Cars (known as \\"doodle bugs\\")—similar to the British Daimler Dingo but manufactured in Canada. The first regimental camp was held in February 1949 and the Regiment was the first CMF unit to go into camp. Regimental Headquarters and Headquarters Squadron was located at Muswellbrook with tank squadrons in Newcastle, Tamworth and Armidale. The regiment was retitled 12th/16th Hunter River Lancers on 31 July 1949, forming part of the 1st Armoured Brigade.Hopkins 1978, pp. 180 & 183. In the following years Regimental HQ was moved to Tamworth and the Regiment was re-roled in the reconnaissance role. The regiment was still equipped with Staghounds and Canadian Scout Cars (the Canadian Scout Cars were replaced by Ferret scout cars, in the late 1950s). In the 1960s the regiment was again reorganised, this time as an Armoured Personnel Carrier regiment equipped with Humber 4 x 4 trucks,Hopkins 1978, p. 341. Ferret scout cars, M3 Personnel Carriers and a solitary Saracen APC. By 1970, the regiment was operating M113A1 APCs. In 1976, the regiment received M113A1 Medium Reconnaissance Vehicles and became a Medium Reconnaissance Regiment. 12/16 HRL reverted to the APC role in 1987, a role which it maintained until 2005 when it was announced that 12/16 HRL would become a Light Cavalry Regiment, and be equipped with new Bushmaster PMVs. Since 2000 many members of the regiment have been attached to regular RAAC units and seen active service in East Timor, Solomon Islands, Iraq and Afghanistan. In September 2007, the regiment received 11 Bushmasters. From 1 January 2018 the regiment went through a number of organisational changes. It was removed from the 8th Brigade and came under the command of the 11th Brigade, Support Squadron in Tamworth was removed from the regiment's ORBAT and at the same time B Squadron was relocated from Muswellbrook in NSW to Caboolture in Queensland. However, no soldiers were involved in this move. All soldiers in the Tamworth, Armidale and Muswellbrook depots became members of A Squadron and the personnel of the new B Squadron were all sourced/recruited from the South-East Queensland region. Current organisation The Regiment is currently organised as follows: * Regimental Headquarters — Tamworth, NSW *'A' Squadron — Armidale, Muswellbrook, Tamworth, NSW *'B' Squadron — Caboolture, QLD. Alliances * — The Royal Scots Dragoon Guards (Carabiniers and Greys) * — The Queen's Royal Lancers - this alliance ceased sometime after 2015 (official date unknown) when the Queens Royal Lancers were amalgamated with the 9th/12th Royal Lancers (Prince of Wales's) on 2 May 2015 to form the Royal Lancers.

Granger is an English and American TV producer, writer, executive and media consultant. Early life and career Born in South Africa and raised both there and in London, Granger studied art and worked for a time as an animation artist. Granger opened and ran Granada TV's American operations. Later, as VP of Time-Life Films, she was responsible for all co-productions with the BBC. One of Granger's projects with Time-Life and the BBC was the historical aviation documentary Reaching for the Skies, which she produced in 1987. It aired on the BBC the following year, and was subsequently re-packaged for American cable network TNT for broadcast in 1989. The version that aired on TNT featured narration by Robert Vaughn, which substituted the English- accented voiceover heard on the BBC version. ABC's Loving In the early 1990s, Granger relocated to the United States when she became a network executive at ABC. She was asked to replace vacating executive producer Fran Sears on the network's lowest rated daytime serial, Loving. The first Loving episode under Granger's watch aired on Tuesday, May 26, 1992. After a falling out between Granger and the head writer left from the Sears era, Addie Walsh, Loving went several months without a replacement head writer. This had an adverse effect on stories which were starting to show new promise for Loving. It was Granger who acted as head writer during that time. Paul Anthony Stewart, who played Casey Bowman from just before Granger's arrival in 1992 until 1995, cited that \\"Loving has great potential, and the cast really works hard. But we were without a head writer for so long that we suffered from a lack of follow-through with some storylines. Haidee [Granger] has worked hard to develop the characters and make them more interesting. And she is really receptive to suggestions, which makes it easier for the actors to embrace the characters. She is absolutely committed to the success of the show.\\" In the fall of 1992, Granger brought back writer Millee Taggart (who had previously acted as head writer from 1988 to 1991), to pair up with Robert Guza, Jr. as the new head writing team. In October 1993, after 17 months of turbulency at Loving, Granger was fired from the position because the show hardly rose from its last position in the daytime ratings. She was replaced by JoAnn Emmerich, ABC's Vice President of Daytime Programming. Later ventures Granger was hired at CBS Studios International in the mid-1980s and later produced a series on sports for the international market and a number of programs for the home video market. Prior to entering real estate, she ran her own boutique media and production company with clients in the Fortune 500. Granger helped negotiate the ITT purchase of WBIS from the city of New York and was chosen to help launch and run the station.

Written by Toto Belano, the film is about a group of beauty contest finalists stranded in a desert island without food, water and shelter. It was re-released in 2008 at the Festival Paris Cinéma together with a retrospective on Gosiengfiao. Plot The film focuses on four young ladies from different social backgrounds, each of them, for their own various reasons, enlists in the fictional \\"Miss Manila Sunshine Beauty Pageant\\". The first of which is Dina (Bonnevie), a college student who entered the contest in order to earn independence from her family and buy her own car. Next is spoiled, rich socialite, Suzanne (Cortez), whose every whim is attended to by her maid, Maria (Sun), and who learned of the contest when fliers, dropped from a helicopter, interrupted her sunbathing at the family pool. Out of sheer vanity and boredom, she decided to sign up. Thirdly, Bambi (Arambulo), while planning her 18th birthday party, when she and her mother argue over the budget, since her once rich family cannot afford the grand debut, Bambi is forced to settle for a much simpler party. But during their argument, Bambi falls on her birthday cake; when she sees the pageant's TV spot, her frustrations over her current situation inspire her to join. Rounding up the group is Azenith (Briones), a con artist who plans to rig the contest by using her and her boyfriend's sexuality to influence the judges into voting for her. The ladies later became the finalists for the competition. En route to the evening gown competition, the ship they boarded catches fire, and the passengers scramble to evacuate and be marooned on an island. The four women, Maria, Joshua (the gay pageant coordinator played by Jonas Sebastian) and his boyfriend Ricardo (Ricky Belmonte), Umberto (one of the ship's waiters played by Domingo Sabado) and Alfredo (played by Alfie Anido) land on a desert island.

Early life He was born James O'Connor in Paddington, west London, England in 1918. His father, James O'Connor, was a merchant mariner and fish monger from Ireland; his mother a part-time prostitute.O'Connor, Jimmy (1976). The Eleventh Commandment. London: Penguin. pp. 191. Growing up in the slums of West London, O'Connor learned the trade of petty theft. Doing the \\"honorable thing\\" he married Mary Agnes Davey, four years his senior, in the spring of 1936. She was Church of England, while he was Irish Catholic. Their son, James William O'Connor, was born on 19 September 1936. Mary O'Connor divorced her husband in 1946 after he attempted to have their son removed from her care and raised Catholic. With the beginning of World War II, O'Connor enlisted and served with the British Expeditionary Forces in France. He was one of the few survivors of the sinking of the ship RMS Lancastria on 17 June 1941, and shared a life raft with Cunard Line Captain Harry Grattidge. After an honorable discharge, he went back to theft and was sentenced to six months in prison in late 1941.\\"Jimmy O'Connor\\". Telegraph.co.uk (2001-11-22). Retrieved on 2008-07-27. When O'Connor was released in 1952, his son, not eager for a reunion, went to sea and eventually served for a few years on The Queen Mary under Capt. Grattidge. Grattidge later wrote about both O'Connor and his son (under the pseudonym \\"Terry\\"). Murder conviction In January 1942, O'Connor was arrested for the murder of George Ambridge on 14 April 1941. In spite of questionable testimony and poor forensic evidence (O'Connor was in the possession of a pocket watch police claimed belonged to the murdered man), he was found guilty and sentenced to death. Two days before he was to hang which would have been on his birthday O'Connor was given a reprieve. While in Dartmoor Prison, O'Connor entered into a correspondence course through Ruskin College. Later life When O'Connor was released from prison in 1952, he became a reporter for the Empire News. Still trying to clear his name with a full pardon, O'Connor met and fell in love with barrister Nemone Lethbridge, who had joined his cause for complete exoneration. They were secretly married in 1959. When their marriage was made public in 1962, with the stigma of O'Connor still being out \\"At Her Majesty's Pleasure\\", Lethbridge was forced out of chambers and left unable to practice law.\\"Jimmy O'Connor\\". Guardian Unlimited (2001-10-03). Retrieved on 2008-07-27 In 1968, O'Connor and Lethbridge petitioned the courts for a pardon based on new information concerning the pocket watch and the confession to O'Connor by the real killer. Although the evidence against O'Connor was in grave doubt, in 1970 the courts denied O'Connor a full pardon. With his earnings as an author, as well as a few well-received tele-plays by Lethbridge, the couple bought a villa on the isle of Mykonos, spending time with the likes of Aristotle and Jackie Onassis. O'Connor and Lethbridge's first son, Ragnar O'Connor, was born in 1970. O'Connor was still bitter about the denial of his pardon and drank most his money away, causing Lethbridge to leave him in 1971 and return to London seeking a restraining order. The couple reconciled long enough to have a second son, Milo O'Connor, in 1973, but shortly thereafter they divorced. O'Connor continued to drink heavily, and returned to London. In 1994, O'Connor was given access to a small selection of files from his 1942 trial. One memo suggested that the actual killer was the same man O'Connor claimed had confessed in 1968.\\"Jimmy O'Connor\\". Guardian Unlimited (2001-10-03). Retrieved on 2008-07-27. Shortly after the discovery, O'Connor suffered a series of strokes and was placed in a Catholic charity nursing home by Lethbridge, just a few blocks from her home in Stoke Newington. On 29 September 2001, Jimmy O'Connor died after another series of strokes at the age of 83. In 2007 (six years after O'Connor's death) Lethbridge (having now been re-instated to chambers) was allowed to bring O'Connor's case once again before the courts. After careful consideration, the courts decided they had serious misgivings concerning O'Connor's conviction. Career O'Connor became a noted and successful tele-playwright with his scripts for The Wednesday Play BBC television series. Released in 1965, Tap on the Shoulder, Three Clear Sundays, and The Profile of a Gentleman drew from O'Connor's experiences in prison and the people he grew up with in the West End. He won critical acclaim for The Coming Out Party in 1967. O'Connor continued to write for television and regained some acclaim with the 1973 Play for Today episode \\"On Her Majesty's Pleasure\\" which brought critical attention to a young actor by the name of Bob Hoskins. In 1976, O'Connor's autobiography The Eleventh Commandment became a best-seller.

Definitions A ribosome is a biological machine that utilizes protein dynamics At the first C.E.C. Workshop, in Brussels in November 1991, bioelectronics was defined as 'the use of biological materials and biological architectures for information processing systems and new devices'. Bioelectronics, specifically bio-molecular electronics, were described as 'the research and development of bio-inspired (i.e. self-assembly) inorganic and organic materials and of bio-inspired (i.e. massive parallelism) hardware architectures for the implementation of new information processing systems, sensors and actuators, and for molecular manufacturing down to the atomic scale'. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce, defined bioelectronics in a 2009 report as \\"the discipline resulting from the convergence of biology and electronics\\". Sources for information about the field include the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) with its Elsevier journal Biosensors and Bioelectronics published since 1990. The journal describes the scope of bioelectronics as seeking to : \\"... exploit biology in conjunction with electronics in a wider context encompassing, for example, biological fuel cells, bionics and biomaterials for information processing, information storage, electronic components and actuators. A key aspect is the interface between biological materials and micro and nano-electronics.\\" History The first known study of bioelectronics took place in the 18th century, when scientist Luigi Galvani applied a voltage to a pair of detached frog legs. The legs moved, sparking the genesis of bioelectronics. Electronics technology has been applied to biology and medicine since the pacemaker was invented and with the medical imaging industry. In 2009, a survey of publications using the term in title or abstract suggested that the center of activity was in Europe (43 percent), followed by Asia (23 percent) and the United States (20 percent).  Materials  Organic bioelectronics is the application of organic electronic material to the field of bioelectronics. Organic materials (i.e. containing carbon) show great promise when it comes to interfacing with biological systems. Current applications focus around neuroscience and infection. Conducting polymer coatings, an organic electronic material, shows massive improvement in the technology of materials. It was the most sophisticated form of electrical stimulation. It improved the impedance of electrodes in electrical stimulation, resulting in better recordings and reducing \\"harmful electrochemical side reactions.\\" Organic Electrochemical Transistors (OECT) were invented in 1984 by Mark Wrighton and colleagues, which had the ability to transport ions. This improved signal-to-noise ratio and gives for low measured impedance. The Organic Electronic Ion Pump (OEIP), a device that could be used to target specific body parts and organs to adhere medicine, was created by Magnuss Berggren. As one of the few materials well established in CMOS technology, titanium nitride (TiN) turned out as exceptionally stable and well suited for electrode applications in medical implants.  Significant Applications  Bioelectronics is used to help improve the lives of people with disabilities and diseases. For example, the glucose monitor is a portable device that allows diabetic patients to control and measure their blood sugar levels. Electrical stimulation used to treat patients with epilepsy, chronic pain, Parkinson's, deafness, Essential Tremor and blindness. Magnuss Berggren and colleagues created a variation of his OEIP, the first bioelectronic implant device that was used in a living, free animal for therapeutic reasons. It transmitted electric currents into GABA, an acid. A lack of GABA in the body is a factor in chronic pain. GABA would then be dispersed properly to the damaged nerves, acting as a painkiller. Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) is used to activate the Cholinergic Anti-inflammatory Pathway (CAP) in the Vagus Nerve, ending in reduced inflammation in patients with diseases like arthritis. Since patients with depression and epilepsy are more vulnerable to having a closed CAP, VNS can aid them as well. At the same time, not all the systems that have electronics used to help improving the lives of people are necessarily bioelectronic devices, but only those which involve an intimate and directly interface of electronics and biological systems.  Future  The improvement of standards and tools to monitor the state of cells at subcellular resolutions is lacking funding and employment. This is a problem because advances in other fields of science are beginning to analyze large cell populations, increasing the need for a device that can monitor cells at such a level of sight. Cells cannot be used in many ways other than their main purpose, like detecting harmful substances. Merging this science with forms of nanotechnology could result in incredibly accurate detection methods. The preserving of human lives like protecting against bioterrorism is the biggest area of work being done in bioelectronics. Governments are starting to demand devices and materials that detect chemical and biological threats. The more the size of the devices decrease, there will be an increase in performance and capabilities.

He brought with him a bundle of apple scions. From his bundle he started a nursery business, which was officially incorporated in 1889. In 1893, Stark Bro's held their first International New Fruit Fair. Jesse Hiatt, who owned an orchard in Peru, Iowa, sent samples of his fruit to compete in the contest for the best new fruit. Hiatt's apples won the judging, but his nametag could not be found. He submitted samples of the same apple the following year and won again. This, time there was a nametag and the apples could be identified. The Stark brothers traveled to the Hiatt farm and bought the rights to the Red Delicious apple in 1894. In 1914, the Stark Golden Delicious apple was discovered and developed. The original tree was found on the Mullins' family farm in Clay County, West Virginia and was locally known as Mullin's Yellow Seedling and Annit apple. Anderson Mullins sold the tree and propagation rights to Stark Bro's Nurseries & Orchards Co., which first marketed it as a companion to their Red Delicious apple in 1914. They collaborated with Luther Burbank who willed over 750 of his varieties to the company. In June 2001 the possibility of closure to Stark Brothers Nurseries, Louisiana, Missouri's oldest and largest employer, famous worldwide for the fruit trees it grew and sold was a reality.\\"Louisiana, Mo., Survives by Adapting to Change\\".

Undubbing is not sanctioned by game publishers. A typical candidate for an undub is a Japanese game which has been published in the United States, with voice acting dubbed in English and text content translated into English, but lacking an in- game option to use the original Japanese audio. The process of undubbing consists of identifying the location and format of the relevant audio content in both the localized and the original versions of the game, then grafting the audio data extracted from the original language version into the localised game. Oftentimes, dialogue will be completely rewritten in translation, which prompts for some to do a total or partial retranslation of the game in order for the displayed text to fit the actual context of the audio content. Content present in the original game, but cut in the process of localization (due to reasons such as censorship, or, in some cases, a lack of time) may also be restored in an undub.  Reasons for undubbing  Voice acting is a considerably bigger business in Japan than it currently is in English-speaking countries (see also Voice acting in Japan). It is not uncommon for acclaimed TV animation voice actors to be signed by a video game publisher to provide voice acting for a high-profile game. In the west, on the other hand, voice localization projects usually have smaller budgets, and as such, do not have as professional a market as the Japanese one. Due to this, there is a perceived notion that Japanese voice acting is of higher quality, and as such many fans prefer to listen to the Japanese audio track while playing the game, even if they do not speak or understand the Japanese language. Undubbing thus caters either to an audience who does not speak the original language or has not mastered it well enough to enjoy the untranslated text in an imported version of the original game, but still prefers the original audio for the reasons mentioned above, or to an audience that speaks the original language, but prefers to read in the Latin alphabet (or simply hear the original voice- actors chosen by the original studio, as it's not uncommon in Japan to create a character with a specific voice-actor in mind). Because the localized text is left in place where present, an undubbed game can usually still be fully played by those who could not play the import.  Notable undubs  The U.S. versions of some Final Fantasy games have been undubbed, including Final Fantasy X-2, a PlayStation 2 game by Square, released in 2003 and undubbed in 2008. Other series that have been undubbed include Mega Man (Rockman in Japan), .hack, Xeno, Megami Tensei, Persona, and Tales.

It is located on the site previously occupied by the El Rancho Hotel and Casino and the Algiers Hotel. Excluding the nearby Stratosphere observation tower, the Drew's 63-floor, 735-foot hotel building is the tallest building in Las Vegas and in the state. The project was announced as Fontainebleau Las Vegas in May 2005, with initial plans to begin construction by March 2006, and to have the resort opened by 2008. It was intended to be a sister property to the Fontainebleau Miami Beach hotel. Construction began in February 2007, but was stopped in 2009, when the project went into bankruptcy. The project, upon completion, was expected to include: a casino, a spa, 3,300-seat performing arts theater, 2,871 hotel rooms, 1,018 condominium units, of retail space, of indoor and outdoor conference space, nightclubs, and 24 restaurants and lounges. The building was designed by Carlos Zapata Studio with Bergman Walls Associates as the architect of record. In August 2017, the unfinished resort was sold to investment firms Witkoff Group and New Valley LLC for $600 million. In February 2018, Witkoff and Marriott International announced a partnership to open the resort as The Drew Las Vegas in late 2020. The opening was later delayed, and the resort is now expected to be opened by November 2022. Upon completion, the project will include three hotels with 3,780 rooms. Witkoff Group founder Steve Witkoff named The Drew after his deceased 22-year-old son, Andrew Witkoff, who died of an OxyContin overdose in 2011. History=Early history= Fontainebleau logo (2008) The property was initially occupied by the Thunderbird hotel and casino, opened in 1948. It was later renamed as the Silverbird, and then as the El Rancho, before closing in 1992. In May 2000, Turnberry Associates purchased the property for $45 million and imploded the El Rancho later that year, to make room for a London-themed resort. The London project was ultimately cancelled because of an economic downturn caused by the September 11 attacks. A privately held company known as Fontainebleau Resorts was later co-founded by Jeff Soffer, who was the chairman and majority owner of Turnberry Associates. In March 2005, Turnberry Associates paid $97 million to purchase of adjacent property – south of the former El Rancho – that had previously been occupied by the Algiers Hotel. The Algiers was to be replaced by the Krystle Sands, a high-rise condominium project that was cancelled earlier that month. The purchase gave Fontainebleau Resorts and Turnberry a total of . Fontainebleau Resorts and Turnberry announced the Fontainebleau Las Vegas on May 12, 2005, as a casino and 4,000-room hotel. The project would be a sister property to the Fontainebleau Miami Beach hotel, purchased by Fontainebleau Resorts earlier that year. The Fontainebleau would be built on the former property of the El Rancho and Algiers, located immediately west of the Turnberry Place high-rise condominium complex. Groundbreaking was expected to occur by March 2006, with the project planned to be opened by 2008. At the time, the company was considering the addition of condominiums to the project, but was still working on the final design plans. Glenn Schaeffer, the former president of Mandalay Resort Group, was hired to oversee the new project as the president and chief executive officer of Fontainebleau Resorts. In August 2006, the project was approved for a 735-foot hotel tower with 2,929 hotel rooms and 959 condominiums. Also approved was a casino, meeting space, restaurants, and show rooms. In September 2006, zoning for the $1.5 billion project was delayed because of concerns from Turnberry Place residents regarding potential traffic increases that would be caused by the new resort. =Construction= The Fontainebleau during construction in July 2008 Turnberry West Construction began construction of the Fontainebleau Las Vegas in February 2007. In April 2007, Publishing and Broadcasting Limited purchased 19.6 percent of Fontainebleau Resorts for $250 million. Preparation work on the property was underway that month, although an official groundbreaking ceremony was not held. At that time, the project was expected to cost $2.8 billion, and was to include a 63-story tower with 3,889 hotel and condo hotel units, as well as a casino. In June 2007, Fontainebleau Resorts secured approximately $4 billion from various financial institutions to pay off debts and to finish its projects, including the Fontainebleau Las Vegas, which was expected to open in fall 2009. At the time, Schaeffer predicted that less than one-third of the resort's revenues would come from its casino. The resort's parking garage was to stand seven stories, with the first two floors to be located underground. In July 2007, plans were approved to increase the garage from seven stories to 23 stories. In August 2007, a construction worker died after a 30-foot fall on the property. Several days later, a large concrete slab in the parking garage fell and caused slabs on two lower floors to collapse. No workers were injured or killed by the three large slabs. Fontainebleau and Turnberry Place in 2010 In October 2007, residents of Turnberry Place alleged that they were deceived by Turnberry, saying they were never notified of the increased size of the Fontainebleau's parking garage. Other residents were concerned about the impact of noise and pollutants from the new project. Soffer said Turnberry did a \\"respectful job\\" of building the Fontainebleau hotel tower away from Turnberry Place residents. Soffer also stated that the property was zoned for a hotel and casino, and said that residents knew such a project would ultimately be built on the property: \\"We're not going to buy a 20-acre property and leave it as a vacant lot. It's a property with proper zoning and nothing was ever promised. It's as simple as that. […] The bottom line is you can't please everyone.\\" Turnberry Place residents planned to have a district judge rule on whether the Clark County Commission should have approved the garage re-design, which was alleged to be in violation of a county ordinance. The judge ruled in favor of the project, stating that the re-design was legally approved. In April 2008, Fontainebleau Resorts stated that the project was fully financed and that progress was continuing despite other local projects that had suffered financial problems, including Crown Las Vegas and the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas. At the time, the project had $2.4 billion in debt. The company planned to put the Fontainebleau's 1,018 condominium units on sale in September 2008. Between $700 million and $900 million in presales was expected to come from the sales. Condominiums were to range between to ; 17 units would be built on each floor, in the center of the tower. A total of 6,000 people were expected to be employed at Fontainebleau upon its opening. The casino was to feature 1,700 slot machines and 125 table games. The tower was topped out in November 2008. =Bankruptcy= Schaeffer left Fontainebleau Resorts without comment in May 2009. Schaeffer was primarily responsible for securing more than US$3 billion in loans for the project. Bank of America, in its capacity as agent for a syndicate of term lenders, refused to disburse additional funds for construction around this time. As a result, the resort's operator, Fontainebleau Las Vegas LLC, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in June 2009. Litigation against Bank of America ensued, alleging that it had wrongfully withheld funds, but the case was resolved in favor of Bank of America in 2012. In a move seen as an attempt to force creditors to supply funding, Fontainebleau's owner sued himself in the form of the general contractor suing the hotel ownership company – both controlled by the same individual, Turnberry Associates CEO Jeffrey Soffer. Construction work has stopped on the project, which was about 70 percent complete; the grand opening had been scheduled for October 2009. Restaurants were among the uncompleted portions of the resort, although many hotel rooms had been finished. In July 2009, the resort sought permission in bankruptcy court to cancel events that were scheduled for the first half of 2010, as well as permission to cancel a lease for office space which was to be used for Fontainebleau's employee recruitment center. In October 2009, Penn National Gaming was considering purchasing the partially completed resort and the of land for US$300 million. At that rate the land was being sold for US$12.25 million per acre. Two years earlier land was going for over US$30 million per acre on the Strip. Over US$2 billion had already been invested in the topped-out building on the site. =Carl Icahn ownership= In a Miami bankruptcy court in November 2009, corporate raider and financier Carl Icahn – who previously controlled American Casino & Entertainment Properties – offered US$156 million in cash and financing, outbidding Penn National Gaming for control of the Fontainebleau. Icahn's bid includes a US$51 million debtor-in-possession loan, which, until the resort is auctioned, will provide funding to stabilize the building, cover employees' salaries, cover previous costs and eliminate the need for the resort to ask the bankruptcy court each week to borrow and spend money. Penn National dropped out of the bidding after going as high as US$145 million; they had offered US$101.5 million in cash and loans. As of November 2009, the cost to complete the resort is an estimated US$1 to 1.5 billion. On February 18, 2010, Carl Icahn assumed part-ownership of the project without an auction by being the only qualified bidder, paying US$150 million. In October 2010, Icahn auctioned off the furnishings previously intended for the building. For example, the Plaza Hotel & Casino in Downtown Las Vegas bought rugs, furniture and mattresses from the sale and used them in a refurbishment that was completed in late 2011. In November 2015, Icahn listed the hotel for sale at an asking price of $650 million. The hotel was listed through the CBRE Group. According to CBRE Group, \\"It will cost about $1.2 billion to finish Fontainebleau. Combined with a purchase price of $650 million, it would take less than $2 billion for a buyer to enter or expand on the Strip market. That's about $500,000 per room, just half of the $1 million or more per room to build new.\\" In April 2017, plans were announced to cover exposed construction areas of the resort's lower floors with cosmetic wrapping, at a cost of $2 million. The exposed construction areas, located along the Las Vegas Strip, were considered an eyesore, and the unfinished resort had become a reminder of the Great Recession. The wrap project began in July 2017. =The Drew= In August 2017, investment firms Witkoff Group and New Valley LLC purchased the resort for $600 million, with plans to rename it. Additional plans were not disclosed for the project at that time. The purchase and planned improvements were financed through Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. In subsequent months, the Las Vegas-based Grand Canyon Development Partners became involved with the project, which also had new hotel operators. The company planned to water-proof the building immediately and eventually complete it, with a substantial interior and exterior redesign. The Fontainebleau was referred to as Project Blue in county records at the time. Penta Building Group was hired to finish the resort, with construction expected to resume in 2018. Plans to finish the project's design and to obtain a construction loan were expedited in December 2017, after the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The project will create 5,000 construction jobs, and 6,000 jobs upon opening. On February 12, 2018, Witkoff and Marriott International announced a partnership to open the renamed project as The Drew Las Vegas in late 2020. In addition to The Drew hotel, the resort will also house hotels from two Marriott brands - EDITION and JW Marriott Hotels, making it the first JW Marriott hotel to open on the Las Vegas Strip. Marriott will manage the three hotels. The resort will feature 3,780 hotel rooms and more than of convention and meeting space. The project's new name received puzzled reactions because of its unclear meaning. A representative for Steve Witkoff's company stated that The Drew \\"feels familiar and approachable, but also fresh and modern – it reflects what people are craving in Las Vegas and signals the experiences Witkoff and Marriott will deliver.\\" The new name is also a tribute to Witkoff's deceased 22-year-old son, Andrew Witkoff, who died of an OxyContin overdose in 2011. Before his purchase, Steve Witkoff said he had heard \\"nasty rumors\\" about the building being in poor condition. He said that such rumors turned out to be false and that the building was in exceptional condition. Witkoff has plans for a bridge to connect The Drew to the expanded Las Vegas Convention Center, which is scheduled to complete its expansion in 2020. In April 2019, Witkoff announced that the opening would be delayed until the second quarter of 2022. The delay was attributed to the amount of time spent working on the project's design. The project's total cost would be $3.1 billion, including the $600 million purchase price, approximately $1.2 billion in construction, and hundreds of millions of dollars for pre-opening costs. The building interior was cavernous and included unfinished escalators, walls, and ceilings, as well as exposed beams and columns. The interior also contained a partially built theater. Witkoff stated the delay would give him better certainty regarding the construction budget. He also announced that a substantial amount of the eventual resort's profits would go to a family foundation that fights drug addiction, in honor of his son. The resort was designed by the architecture firm Diller Scofidio + Renfro. Bobby Baldwin was announced as the chief executive officer of The Drew Las Vegas in November 2019. Witkoff expected to finalize a construction loan of approximately $2 billion during early 2020. At the time, Witkoff said the interior of the building was active with hundreds of workers, and that a much larger construction presence would be noticeable later in the year with potentially 2,000 workers. The resort is expected to be opened by November 2022.

As reported in the Chicago Tribune, \\"It was a supernova in the local and national nightlife firmament.\\" Mr. Kelly’s was owned and operated by brothers Oscar and George Marienthal, whose Chicago empire included the London House, an upscale jazz supper club, and the theatrically oriented Happy Medium.Chicago Sun-Times, August 21, 2005 Early days Mister Kelly’s opened on November 24, 1953 on Rush Street in ChicagoChicago Social Magazine, Klobuchar, January, 2000 as a restaurant featuring steaks and Green Goddess salad as a house special.Chicago Tribune, January 11, 1959 In 1954, entertainment was added with two singer- pianists, Buddy Charles and Audrey Morris, as the first entertainers.Chicago Tribune, October 17, 1954Chicago Tribune, October 24, 1954 The nightclub was destroyed on December 8, 1955 when a fire started in a grease chute and spread through a ventilator into the club.2 Mister Kelly’s was rebuilt and reopened on August 29, 1956Chicago Tribune, Tower Ticker, August 29, 1956 with a new policy of standup singers.

The new color television show was entitled Here’s Music – At London House and Mister Kelly's.

This combination remained the club's format for the next 16 years. New talent and established entertainers were featured. For example, in April, 1960 comedian Bob Newhart, and songstress Janice Halpern were featured.Chicago Tribune, On the Town, April 10, 1960 In 1963, Oscar Marienthal discovered a young singer at a small New York nightclub and booked her several months before she was to appear.

Thomas Pollard was christened on 11 December 1597 in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. His date of death is not known. Career Pollard starting as a boy player specializing in women's roles. He was trained by John Shank, a noted comic actor; and after he matured and left female roles behind, Pollard acquired his own reputation as a gifted comic performer. His most notable part was the title role in Fletcher's The Humorous Lieutenant. He had the comical role of Timentes the cowardly general in Arthur Wilson's The Swisser. He played Silvio in Webster's The Duchess of Malfi, in the productions of c. 1614 and c. 1621.Halliday, p. 144. He appeared in Shakespeare's Henry VIII, probably in the 1628 revival at the Globe Theatre. Pollard played the role of Pinac in The Wild Goose Chase in the 1632 revival, and was in a number of other Fletcherian plays, The Lovers' Progress,The Maid in the Mill, The Queen of Corinth, Sir John van Olden Barnavelt, and The Spanish Curate. Pollard acted parts in plays by Philip Massinger, including The Roman Actor (Aelius Lamia and Stephanus), Believe as You List (Berecinthius), and The Picture (Ubaldo). He also acted in works by John Ford, including The Laws of Candy and The Lover's Melancholy; and by James Shirley, including The Cardinal. He \\"doubled\\" several small parts in John Clavell's The Soddered Citizen (1630). (The text of Believe as You List draws humor from the fatness of Berecinthius, the character played by Pollard. By 1631, the year the play was acted, Pollard seems to have grown corpulent.) Controversy Pollard was intimately involved in a major controversy that marked the King's Men company in the 1630s. When the troupe had acquired its two theatres, the Globe (1598–99) and the Blackfriars (1608), prominent members of the company owned shares in the theatres, and so gained additional shares in their profits, beyond what they earned as actors. They were termed \\"housekeepers\\" of the theatres. Over the next generation, actors died and passed their shares to their heirs; their replacements, in the next generation of actors, were cut out of the housekeepers' income (though as sharers in the acting company, they received their own portions of the profits). In 1635, three prominent actors, Pollard, Eliard Swanston, and Robert Benfield, petitioned the Lord Chancellor, Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke, to be allowed to purchase theatre shares from the present housekeepers; and Pembroke agreed. Those existing shareholders, principally Cuthbert Burbage and John Shank, did not want to sell their lucrative shares, however. The dispute generated a body of documents, sometimes called the Sharers' Papers, that reveal valuable information on the theatrical conditions of the Caroline era.Halliday, p. 449. The Sharers' Papers indicate that Pollard had an annual income of £180 at the time, purely as a sharer in the acting company. Later years Pollard continued with the company even after the closing of the London theatres in September 1642, at the start of the English Civil War. He was one of the ten King's Men who signed the dedication to the first Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1647, and one of the seven who tried to re-activate the company in 1648. He was also one of the performers arrested on 1 January 1649, when soldiers of the Commonwealth regime raided the Cockpit Theatre and caught actors in the midst of an illegal performance -- of Rollo Duke of Normandy, as chance had it. Pollard was playing the Cook. The actors spent a short time incarcerated in Hatton House, then were released.Milhous and Hume, pp. 491-2. The Interregnum years were rough-and-tumble for unemployed or under-employed actors. In 1655 Theophilus Bird filed a lawsuit that claimed that Pollard and fellow King's Man Michael Bowyer, along with \\"some others\\", had sold the company's playbooks and its expensive costumes, and owed Bird a share in the proceeds.Gurr, p. 203. Bird claimed in his 1655 suit that Pollard was worth £500 when he died; but the date of his death is unknown. James Wright's Historia Histrionica (1699) states that Pollard \\"Lived Single, and Had a Competent Estate; Retired to some relations he had in the Country, and there ended his Life\\".Gurr, p. 237.

The ballroom has a decorated balcony on three sides, It was requisitioned by the Admiralty in 1918 for military use during World War I to assemble gas envelopes for the R.33 airship, before being handed back a year later. The floor was replaced in late 1934 with 10,000 pieces of oak, mahogany, walnut and greenwood, laid over 1,320 four-inch springs. It is one of the few remaining sprung dancefloors in Britain. A new stage was also built, with space for a lift provided for the Wurlitzer organ console. The Wurlitzer organ that was installed in the Empress Ballroom in the winter of 1934/35 was originally from the Tower Ballroom. Its specification was enlarged to match the specification of the new organ at the Tower Ballroom. The console was placed on a lift in the centre of the stage, and the pipe chambers directly above the stage. Horace Finch, pianist and accordionist for Bertini's Tower Ballroom band, was appointed the position of Empress Ballroom Organist from 1935-1962. The organ was removed in 1969 and was installed in the BBC Playhouse Studio in Manchester. It was in use there until its removal in 1988 after which it was purchased and parted out by the Sussex Theatre Organ Trust The Empress Ballroom was a popular dance venue until the 1960s with British dance bands playing summer residences of four weeks during the summer seasons. They included the bands of Geraldo, Joe Loss, Ted Heath, John Dankworth, Jack Parnell, and Ken McIntosh. In 1964, the Rolling Stones caused a riot at the ballroom during a series of UK dates. Fifty fans and two policemen were treated at Blackpool Victoria Hospital. Four of the offending fans appeared in court the following day. The band was banned from performing in the town; the ban was lifted in 2008, 44 years after the event.\\"Sympathy for the Stones as Blackpool buries the hatchet over 1964 riot\\" - The Independent, 28 March 2008 In the late 1970s, some of the floor space was adapted for other purposes to reduce the venue's over-capacity. It was used in the summer seasons of 1970-74 as a cabaret-dining venue called The Stardust Garden. The ballroom has been used as a conference venue for many years by the Labour Party, Conservative Party and Liberal Democrats. The ballroom has hosted the World Matchplay darts tournament, run by the Professional Darts Corporation, since 1994, which is shown live on Sky Sports It also hosts numerous dance competitions, such as the British Sequence Championships and the Blackpool Dance Festival, an annual ballroom dance competition, since its inception in 1920. On 1 March 1974, the ballroom was the venue for the opening concert of Queen's first ever headlining tour of the UK. On 14 and 15 January 2017, the ballroom hosted a two-day tournament to crown the first-ever WWE United Kingdom Champion. On 12 January 2019, it hosted NXT UK TakeOver: Blackpool, the first-ever NXT UK TakeOver event. This was followed one year later with NXT UK TakeOver: Blackpool II on 12 January 2020.

It is conceptually different, and often confused with value noise. This method consists of a creation of a lattice of random (or typically pseudorandom) gradients, dot products of which are then interpolated to obtain values in between the lattices. An artifact of some implementations of this noise is that the returned value at the lattice points is 0. Unlike the value noise, gradient noise has more energy in the high frequencies.

He worked in Government Secretariat and Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). He was the Chairman of Consumer Council from 2007 to 2012. Political Activism Cheung joined Meeting Point, a moderate pro-democratic party. He became Chairman from 1989 to 1994. After the merge of United Democrats of Hong Kong and Meeting Point, Cheung was the Vice-Chairman until 2004, when he resigned after a series of internal conflicts between him and the more radical Young Turks (少壯派). In 2002, he and Andrew Fung co-founded SynergyNet (新力量網絡), a policy think tank. Research Cheung joined City Polytechnic of Hong Kong (now City University of Hong Kong) in 1986. He specializes in Hong Kong politics, especially on civil service and public administration. He describes the narrative of administrative efficiency proposed by the colonial government as the effort to re-establish legitimacy and power amid the growing assertiveness of China and increasing influence of political parties, as the move diverts political pressure to respective departments. He argues that post-Handover Hong Kong government should change its mindset and pay more attention to public opinion. Instead of following the colonial approach of administrative absorption of politics (a term coined by Ambrose King), leaders and administrators should develop creative and effective strategies to respond to influential business sector, vocal political parties and an assertive China. As the Secretary for Transport and Housing, Cheung wrote in 2013 that the polarization and fragmentation of Hong Kong society is harmful and destructive to its political and economic well-being. He called for better coordination with the legislature, more attention to responsiveness and representation as well as \\"stronger social policy emphasis in public administration.\\" Works Books * (Editor) * (Co-edited with Ian Scott) * (Co-edited with Jane Lee) Articles *\\"Public Governance Reform in Hong Kong: Rebuilding Trust and Governability.\\" International Journal of Public Sector Management 26.5 (2013): 421–36. *\\"Can There Be An Asian Model of Public Administration?.\\" Public Administration and Development 33.4 (2013): 249–61. *\\"One country, two experiences: administrative reforms in China and Hong Kong.\\" International Review of Administrative Sciences 78.2 (2012): 261–83. *\\"Public administration in East Asia: legacies, trajectories and lessons.\\" International Review of Administrative Sciences 78.2 (2012): 209–16. *\\"Global aspirations and strategising for world-class status: new form of politics in higher education governance in Hong Kong.\\" Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management 33.3 (2011): 231–51.

Settled in 1872, the community is located between Hillsboro and Newberg, in the southern portion of the Tualatin Valley in the foothills of the Chehalem Mountains. The community retains its agricultural heritage.Mandel, Michelle. Scenic sojourn. The Oregonian, November 4, 1999. Laurel is served by the Hillsboro School District and includes the century-old Laurel Valley Store building, which is in the process of being turned into a restaurant. History When Euro-American settlers came to what is now Washington County, the area was inhabited by the Atfalati Native American group. Smallpox epidemics struck the Atfalati and by the mid-1830s, only 10 percent of the tribe was left. An 1855 government treaty removed the remaining Atfalati to the Grand Ronde Indian Reservation, where there are still about 20 individuals who identify themselves as Atfalati. In 1872, the Mulloy family settled the area that is now Laurel.Mulloy, E.C. \\"Laurel receives post office in 1879 after long wait\\". Hillsboro Argus, October 19, 1976, Communities, p. 12. Laurel received its name in the spring of 1879 when a number of citizens in the surrounding area met at the Union Schoolhouse, which was located a quarter mile east of the crossroads, to petition for a post office. C. W. Williams, who then lived on what was later the Mainland place, suggested the name of Laurel and there being many trees in the vicinity that they thought were Laurel trees, the name seemed appropriate and was accepted. (Later it was discovered that those were Madrone trees and not Laurel trees.) In May 1879, the Laurel post office was established with Alfred Mulloy, Sr. as postmaster. Mail was delivered once per week until 1881 when deliveries increased to twice per week. The population was 150 people in 1880, but dropped to 29 in the 1900 census. The post office was closed in 1935. The Laurel Valley Store was opened in 1893 by Gus, Maud, and Jacob Messinger. In 1913 Ewell and Ella Turner purchased the store and in 1913 moved the store building and attached residence a short distance South and erected the present Laurel store building with residence attached.Gardner, Fran. Laurel Valley Store has survived nearly a Century. The Oregonian, August 1, 1991. The last manager of the store was Hyun Chung Lee who in 2017 sold the store to Sean and Quin Denfeld. Renovation work is currently in progress. On June 14, 1856 the Laurel School District became the third elementary district formed in Washington County. The first building, a small one-room schoolhouse was built in 1858 and was located north of the Laurel intersection. In 1881 the present location was chosen for a new building and in 1925 the current building was built with an addition made in 1952. In 1962 voters of Laurel and Farmington View voted to consolidate the districts and Laurel's students were moved to Farmington. Seventh and eighth graders went to a junior high school in Hillsboro. Laurel School was made into apartments. A telephone line was extended to Laurel in 1904 from Hillsboro with four customers. The population grew to 50 residents in 1910. In 1923, Laurel Community Hall was constructed for about $5,000. The purpose of the hall was \\"to promote sociability and friendship amongst its members and all people of the community.\\" Finis Brown was the founder. The hall was dedicated on February 2, 1924; the mortgage was paid off in 1928. 400 people came to one of the fund raising chicken dinners and they paid $1.00 each. The hall has been used as a school gym, dance hall, Farmers Union meeting site, school Christmas programs and graduations, family gatherings, and is now the location of the Laurel Valley School of Dance. Churches In 1876, community members started a congregation at Mountain Top with W.C. Kantner as preacher.Felton, Charles. \\"Evangelical mission work started Laurel Church in early 1870s\\". Hillsboro Argus, October 19, 1976, Schools and Churches, p. 6. A Baptist church was also started that year by the Brown, Steventon, Shamly, and Messinger families. The Mulloy family donated to the church in 1878 for a chapel and cemetery, and a church was built and named the Mount Olive Baptist Church during the summer. The cemetery was laid out in 1880. Church in the community Laurel Church had its beginnings around 1888 when J.M. Beaumont, an Evangelical preacher, started preaching at the Baptist church. In 1892, the church was transferred to the Hillsboro mission of the church from the Newberg mission. In 1897, Rosilla and George Hathorn donated land and a new church was built, named Bethany United Evangelical Church. In 1800, the United Brethren Church was organized by Phillip Otterbein, with the churches merging in 1946. In 1947, Lester Moore began as the church's first full-time pastor. On September 22, 1948, the original church building burned down. A new structure was erected, and a dedication ceremony was held on January 29, 1950. In 1960, a new parsonage was added, followed by an expansion started in 1974. The multi-purpose building where services are now held was dedicated in 1997.  Present  The community has several agricultural farms and plant nurseries, although most of its residents commute to Portland, Hillsboro, or Beaverton for work. The Laurel Valley School of Dance has provided dance lessons in the Laurel Hall for over 30 years.Luedloff, Rebecca. Neighborhood Roundup – Metro West Hillsboro. The Oregonian, July 26, 2007.

It demonstrated widespread antisemitism in rural Austria in the time between the World Wars.  Crime  On September 10, 1928, Latvian Jewish dentist Morduch Halsman was murdered while on a hiking tour in the Zillertal valley in the Austrian Tyrol with his son, Philippe Halsman, then a 22-year-old student of engineering in Dresden. Philippe said he was walking some steps ahead of his father, then heard a cry and saw him falling down the precipice.Marin Pollack: Anklage Vatermord. Der Fall Philipp Halsmann. Fischer, Frankfurt, 2004 (german) By the time Philippe found a path and scrambled down to the river bank below, his father had been robbed and killed. His empty wallet was found alongside the body. A series of unsolved crimes in the area and its growing antisemitism empowered local officials, who, without evidence or motive, arrested Philippe Halsman and charged him with his father’s death.Marin Pollack: Anklage Vatermord. Der Fall Philipp Halsmann. Fischer, Frankfurt, 2004 (german) The next day the body of Morduch Halsman was recovered and autopsied. Soon after, Philippe was brought to Innsbruck to stand trial.  Trials  The trial began on December 13, 1928 at the Innsbruck state court. Many relatives and friends from the Halsman family's hometown, Riga, came to support Philippe, but his position was desperate from the start.Marin Pollack: Anklage Vatermord. Der Fall Philipp Halsmann. Fischer, Frankfurt, 2004 (german) The testimony against him came from witnesses in Breitlahner, the town nearby (some connected to the Heimwehr movement, a network of proto-Nazi activity) who claimed to have found Philippe’s behavior at the crime scene suspicious. There was also circumstantial evidence: a stone had been found with the victim’s blood and hair, but there was no evidence linking the stone to Philippe. The most powerful argument for his defense was the lack of a motive, supported by testimony of Halsman's relatives which upheld the loving relationship between father and son.Oliver Halsman Rosenberg: Unknown Halsman. DAP, New York, 2008 Nevertheless, after four days of trial, the jury voted 9-3 for conviction, and Philippe Halsman was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment in solitary confinement. The legitimacy of that judgement was immediately challenged by journalists and legal scholars all over Austria and Germany. The Supreme Court of Austria reversed the verdict and sent the case back to Innsbruck. At the second trial on October 19, 1929, Halsman was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to four years of imprisonment.  Aftermath  Observers of the trial noted the widespread antisemitism in Tyrol and the public condemnation of Halsman. Halsman’s sister Liouba worked for his release and drew international attention to the case. Leading intellectuals of the time, among them Sigmund Freud, Albert Einstein and Thomas Mann endorsed his innocence. Freud's opinion emphasized that the Oedipus Complex, which the experts who testified at trial offered as the motive for Halsman's behavior was, in fact, universal and should not have been offered as a motive weighing toward Halsman's guilt. Finally, on October 1, 1930 the President of Austria Wilhelm Miklas pardoned Halsman. Philippe left Austria for Paris, where he joined his mother and sister and began his career as a photographer.

History  In the search for a new, fast, goods train locomotive, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG) in 1934 was attracted by the proposal from the Berliner Maschinenbau (BMAG, formerly Louis Schwartzkopff) for a 2-8-2 (1'D1'h2) engine. The design, produced by Friedrich Wilhelm Eckhardt (1892–1961), differed from the DRG's original requirement for a 2-8-0 (1'D) engine, because the required performance with an 18-ton axle load was easier to generate on a 2-8-2 engine rather than one with a 2-8-0 wheel configuration. Continued adherence to this instruction would in the end have given the new engine no significant advantage over the Prussian goods train locomotives which were to be withdrawn. The Reichsbahn Central Office Engineering Works (RZM) eventually agreed to this proposal; the BMAG was tasked to develop the proposed design and produce two prototypes. In January 1937 the two prototype locomotives, 41 001 and 41 002, were delivered to the DRG, who subsequently tested them thoroughly and bought them. The prototypes soon proved themselves, with their power, performance and quiet riding qualities, as well as their exceptional acceleration. In developing the Class 41, the principle of having standard locomotives (Einheitsloks) demonstrated the financial advantages of standardization. For example, the construction costs of the engine, through the use of components from the simultaneously developed Class 03, 06 and 45 engines, was under 10,000 Reichsmarks. From October 1938, the first full-scale production Class 41 locomotives were ordered by the now renamed (since February 1937) Deutsche Reichsbahn (DRB). All the well-known locomotive manufacturers in Germany participated in the building of the locomotives, including BMAG, Borsig, Maschinenfabrik Esslingen, Henschel & Sohn, Arnold Jung Lokomotivfabrik, Krauss-Maffei, Krupp, Orenstein & Koppel and Schichau. Unlike the prototype locomotives, corner valve pressure compensators were omitted from the production locos and Nicolai pressure compensating tubular valves (later Karl Schultz valves) were used to give a better ride when running light. On the valve gear, the normal lifting link (Hängeeisen) replaced the Kuhn slides of the prototypes which were expensive to manufacture. As with Classes 03, 45 and 50, the 20-bar boiler, which was made of St 47 K and not a non-aging steel, soon caused major problems. As early as 1941, the DRB decreed a reduction of the permissible operating pressure to 16 bar. In this way the wear and tear on the boiler could at least be slowed. The axle load of the locomotive could be switched between 18 t and 20 t by inserting bolts into different sockets in the equalising beams. This was supposed to enable the locomotive to be more versatile in its use. Little or no use was made of this flexibility however. The Deutsche Bundesbahn and East German DR later left the bolts in the 18 t setting. The locomotives were, with the exception of the prototypes, coupled to 2'2'T34 tenders. The prototypes, 41 001 and 41 002, had 2'2'T32 tenders on delivery. From their use of 20m turntables, it is also known that some engines were running with 2'2T30 tenders. The advent of war increasingly stifled the purchase of fast goods train locomotives until, in January 1941, the existing orders were cancelled completely. On 2 June 1941, MF Esslingen delivered the last Class 41 locomotive, no. 41 352, to the DRB. With that a total of 366 engines of this class had been built in just under four years.  Preserved Locomotives  After the Second World War, 216 engines went into the Deutsche Bundesbahn fleet and 122 were left in the hands of the DR in East Germany. There is evidence that, in addition, 22 locomotives were left in the former Reichsbahn railway division of Breslau in Poland and later incorporated into the Polish State Railways (PKP) as Ot 1-1 to Ot 1-19. Number 41 153 was listed on the books of the Czechoslovakian State Railways (CSD) after 1945. Number 41 034 as well as other locomotives (41 076, 41 082 and 41 312) from locomotive convoys (reparations) were left in the territory of the Soviet State Railway (SZD) and later transferred to the PKP. The fate of other locomotives is unknown. As a result of the employment of the two prototype locomotives at Schneidemühl (present-day Piła) locomotive shed in heading express cattle trains to Berlin, the engines were unflatteringly christened Ochsenlok (Oxen loco).  DB Rebuild  Because the boiler of these engines suffered from metal fatigue, they began to be repaired in the 1950s. Between 1957 and 1961, 107 vehicles were fitted with fully welded boilers, like those installed on the Class 03.10. In addition the front part of the frame and the running plate were changed. Forty examples were converted to oil-firing with heavy oil. From 1968, these were designated as Class 042. The last Class 042 steam locomotives were retired in 1977 at Rheine locomotive shed. The photograph (right) shows one as a museum loco, now reclassified to Class 41 (the pre-1968 designation). The former DB locomotives, 41 105 and 41 241, have been preserved as representatives of their class by Stoom Stichting Nederland in the Netherlands. Number 41 018, an operational loco owned by the Munich Steam Locomotive Company, is stabled at the Augsburg Railway Park and 41 113 is exhibited in the Technical Museum at Sinsheim. The Osnabrück Steam Engine Friends are working hard to restore 41 052 to operational status, after it had stood for a long time as a monument at Osnabrück-Schinkel. Number 41 096 is preserved as operational loco at Klein-Mahner. Number 41 360 is operated by the Dampflok-Tradition Oberhausen e.V. Since the end of ban on steam locomotives, she has provided a comprehensive programme of journeys on the Deutsche Bahn's railway network. * 41 018 oil-fired Dampflok-Gesellschaft München e.V. * 41 096 oil-fired Dampflok-Gemeinschaft 41 096 e.V.

The reduction of boiler overpressure from 20 to 16 bar had certainly slowed their susceptibility to damage, but could not prevent it entirely. Of the 112 locomotives recorded in the DR fleet in 1955, only 12 had already been equipped with a '1943 Type' replacement boiler and were therefore safe. Problems with the St 47 K boilers, however, increased massively. Repair welding did not produce the desired effect, but made the material even more brittle and the danger of cracks developing and boiler explosions was greater than before. And it was not just the Class 41 that was affected. Classes 03, 03.10 and 50, with boilers made of non-aging St 47 K, were also prone to damage. As a result of increasing difficulties the DR had to withdraw over 300 locomotives from service in 1956 which abruptly led to an enormous shortage of engines. The urgent call for action which then resulted led at last to the development and subsequent ordering of a new boiler (later called the 39E) that, with a few minor alterations, was also usable on locomotive classe 03, 03.10 and 39. Because the delivery of the new boilers kept being delayed, 21 Class 41 locomotives were simply fitted with replacement boilers to the old design by January 1959. Even the Meiningen repair shop made a complete copy of the old boiler for 41 075\\\\. Other damaged boilers were fully repaired and many parts replaced. Combustion chamber boiler of type 39E (Meiningen, 2003) Regardless of that, DR engineers worked on a \\"reconstruction programme for the recovery of the steam locomotive fleet.\\" This envisaged, amongst other things, the modernisation of 102 Class 41 locomotives. The German term used for reconstruction was Rekonstrucktion or Reko for short, hence the subsequent designation of the locomotives as Rekolokomotiven or Rekoloks. Demarcation disputes, disagreements over the detail of the reconstruction programme and the continued non-delivery of the Reko boiler, delayed the start of work still further. Only the explosion of 03 1046's St47K boiler in 1958 at Wünsdorf led to pressure from the then transport minister, Erwin Kramer (1902–1979), to get started on the Reko programme. The mighty drive of a Reko 41, (2006) Heating locomotive from Rekolokomotive 41 1303, (Röbel 2007) Class 41 for scrapping, sidelined in Stendal, (1979) From 1959 onwards, 80 Class 41 locomotives were to be given the new 39E Reko boilers in the Zwickau and Karl Marx Stadt Reichsbahn repair shops (Reichsbahnausbesserungswerke or RAW). As part of the rebuild, IfS/DR mixer preheaters, pressure-compensating piston valves (Trofimoff valves) and new Stühren ash pans were installed. The wider outer firebox needed new front walls to the driver's cab, the front windows of which were equipped with demisting equipment. For the larger and heavier VMP 15-20 compounded mixer pump (Verbundmischpumpe) a new pump mount had to be built. This and the new mixer preheater apparatus required a different arrangement for the main air reservoir. The outside cylinders with a diameter of just , originally designed for boiler pressures of 20 bar, were retained however. In the course of the rebuild, the brakes on the front carrying axle were removed. The 39E Reko boiler fitted to the engines is a combustion chamber boiler and can generate 15 tons of steam per hour, thanks to the improved ratio of radiative to tube heating area. This is considerably higher than, for example, the new DB boiler which generates only 13.3 tons of steam per hour. Fitted with this boiler, the engine was able to exceed the performance requirements that it originally had for the 20 bar boilers, in spite of its small cylinders. The engines rebuilt in this way are classified as Rekolokomotiven. Following their conversion, the DR gave all Class 41 locomotives the extra digit 1 under their 1970 renumbering scheme, so that e.g. number 41 122 became number 41 1122-5. In contrast to other classes, the Class 41 was not given a separate sub-class to distinguish Reko from non-Reko locomotives. Class 41 Rekoloks could be seen in regular train service until 1988. The second oil crisis in 1979/80, and its effect on the GDR's economy, granted quite a number of Class 41 engines a short return to operational duties. Even several locomotives earmarked for scrapping were refurbished and were given a new general inspection service. The Meiningen repair shed refurbished a total of 23 locomotives of this class between 1980 and 1983. But by the end of September 1984, Oebisfelde shed withdrew the 41s and transferred its locomotives to Güsten shed. Göschwitz station, a satellite of Saalfeld shed was the next to send its 41s to the storage sidings in November 1986, and at the beginning of May 1988, Staßfurt (Bw Güsten) parted company with the last Class 41 locomotive, 41 1231, in regular service in the DR. The Class 41 was the most versatile steam locomotive in the DR's engine fleet and hauled high- profile express and fast trains, as well as goods and passenger services. Number 41 1185 was a DR heritage locomotive, now in the ownership of the Nuremberg Transport Museum. As of 2009 the following are the only two operational locomotives remaining: * 41 1144 IGE Werrabahn-Eisenach e.V. * 41 1150 Bavarian Railway Museum (Nördlingen) A further 8 Rekolokomotiven are in varying states of repair.

He became coadjutor bishop of Derry. Life He was the son of Patrick Maginn, a farmer, and his wife, Mary Slevin. He was educated by his uncle, parish priest of Monaghan, and later by Thomas MacColgan, at Buncrana, Donegal, and entered the Irish College, Paris, in 1818. He was ordained in 1825 at Derry, and was soon appointed curate of Moville, where he remained till 1829, becoming known as a preacher. He opposed the efforts made by the Episcopalians body to proselytize his flock, and took a prominent part in a public controversy held at Derry concerning Catholic doctrines, a report of which was published later in book form (Dublin, 1828). In 1829 he became parish priest of Fahan, and applied himself to the suppression of agrarian secret societies, while appealing to the Government to protect the peasantry against the abuse of power by the local non-Catholic magistrates. He endeavoured to heal the breach between the young Irelanders and O'Connell. He accepted the \\"national school\\" system, and by his protests prevented the withdrawal of the schools from clerical control. He repudiated the Queen's Colleges, and helped to bring about their condemnation at Rome. He was an advocate the establishment of a Catholic university, which, however, he did not live to see. On 18 January 1846, he was consecrated titular Bishop of Orthosia, and coadjutor to Dr. John McLaughlin of Derry. Seized with typhus fever on 14 January 1849, he died three days later in St. Columb's College and was buried at Buncrana, Donegal. Maginn was an important factor in the rehabilitation of the Catholic Church in Ulster after Emancipation. His letters on land and the Poor Law administration, together with his evidence before the Devon Commission (Report published at Dublin, 1847), contain valuable information on the social condition of Ireland in the first half of the nineteenth century. The conduct of government officials during the Irish Famine of 1847-49 inspired him with an abhorrence of English misrule. A series of letters was in reply to Lord Stanley, who in the House of Lords, 23 November 1847, had accused the Irish Catholic clergy of using the confessional to encourage lawlessness and crime (\\"Refutation of Lord Stanley's Calumnies against the Catholic Clergy of Ireland\\", reprint, Dublin, 1850).

In this game, a hare is trying to get past three dogs who are trying to surround it and trap it. The three dogs are represented by three pieces which normally start on one end of the board, and the hare is represented by one piece that usually starts in the middle of the board or is dropped on any vacant point in the beginning of the game. Hare games are similar to Bear games and hunt games. One side has more pieces than the other with the larger side attempting to hem in the smaller side. The smaller side though is usually compensated with more powers. Where Hare games differ is that the hounds can only move forward or sideways, and not backwards. The hunters in the Bear games can move in all directions. Furthermore, the dog in the Hare games cannot capture any of the hares, unlike the tigers, leopards, jaguars, and foxes in the hunt games which can capture their respective prey counterparts. There are several different Hare game boards depending upon the country of origin. Many preferred the narrow double- ended spearhead-like boards with orthogonal and diagonal lines running through them. There were several variations on this design. However, one in Denmark used a round board, and another design is found in Latvia. Hare games are referred to by different names. In 19th century France, a hare game that was popular among the military was called The Soldiers' Game. The dog is sometimes referred to as a hound, and hence the alternative title to this game as Hare and hounds. Other names are French Military Game, Game of Dwarfs, The Devil among tailors, and Trevolpa or Volpalejden . As the rules of the game are simple to program, there are many electronic implementations of the game. The second link below allows you to play this game. In this computer game, the hares and hounds are reversed. Instead, it is the hounds attempting to surround and immobilize the hare. Goal The three hounds attempt to surround and immobilize the hare. The hare attempts to pass the hounds, and/or reach the other end of the board. Equipment There are a variety of Hare game boards. The more common one is a two-ended spearhead-like board with orthogonal and diagonal lines running through it. Three pieces representing the hounds are of one color, and one piece representing the hare is of another color. Gameplay and rules # Players decide which animal to play. Depending on the versions, the hounds will usually be placed on one end of the board while the hare will be placed in the middle of the board or dropped onto any vacant point on the board in the first move. # It is unknown exactly which animal traditionally starts first, and it may actually depend on which Hare game version is played, or perhaps there was no traditional first player, and it was up to the players themselves to decide who goes first. Players alternate their turns. # Hounds can only move straight forward, diagonally forward, or sideways. They cannot move backwards in any way. They can only move one space per turn onto a vacant point, and follow the pattern on the board. Only one hound can be moved per turn. There are no captures in this game by either the hounds or the hare. # The hare can move one space in any direction onto a vacant point following the pattern on the board. # If the hare successfully passes the three hounds or reaches the other end of the board, the hare wins. If the hounds surround and immobilize the hare, the hounds win. Variants=Hare and Hounds= Rules of the game A starting position for a game of Hare and Hounds * One player represents the three Hounds, which try to corner the other player's Hare as it seeks to win by escaping them. * The Hounds move first. Each player can move one piece one step in each turn. The Hounds can only move forward or diagonally (left to right) or vertically (up and down). The Hare can move in any direction. * The Hounds win if they \\"trap\\" the Hare so that it can no longer move. * The Hare wins if it \\"escapes\\" (gets to the left of all the Hounds). * If the Hounds move vertically ten moves in a row, they are considered to be \\"stalling\\" and the Hare wins. Analysis and modern implementations Hare and Hounds is a classic example of the type of game studied in combinatorial game theory, giving it some similarities to checkers (draughts), Go, Fox and Geese and other such games. Mathematician Martin Gardner in his October 1963 Mathematical Games column in Scientific American stated that Hare and Hounds \\"combines extreme simplicity with extraordinary strategic subtlety\\".The Sixth Scientific American Book of Mathematical Puzzles and Diversions (1971), Simon & Schuster. With perfect play, the game is a win for the hare by stalling. For Hare and Hounds in Variants, with perfect play, the game is a win for the hounds without changing starting position that the hare escapes trivially.Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays, Volume 3 (2018), Berlekamp, E.

Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences, 47(9), 1159-1181. dating to ~68.5 million years ago. Albertonykus is interpreted as having fed on wood-nesting termites because the forelimbs appear specialized for digging, but are too short for burrowing. Albertonykus is the earliest-known North American alvarezsaurid. Isolated bones of alvarezsaurids are known from late Maastrichtian rocks in Montana and Wyoming (USA). The type species is A. borealis, described by Nicholas Longrich and Philip Currie in 2009. The specific name (borealis) means \\"north\\".

The bones of Albertonykus were discovered through a coincidental association with a much larger theropod dinosaur. In 1910, paleontologist Barnum Brown and his crew found a site filled with the bones of the gigantic tyrannosaurid Albertosaurus sarcophagus. They unearthed the remains of at least nine different specimens of Albertosaurus in the single site, but stopped digging after just two weeks.Nick Longrich, University of Calgary, Renewed quarrying in the Albertosaurus bonebed in Dry Island Provincial Park again produced the remains of over twenty specimens of Albertosaurus, and the quarry has yet to be fully excavated. It is not known why so many tyrannosaurs were found in one place: paleontologist Nick Longrich speculated that the site was part of a predator trap, where trapped prey animals drew predators to their deaths. At the same site, over a dozen arm and leg bones belonging to an unknown species of small theropod were in 2002 excavated by a team of scientist led by Philip John Currie of the University of Alberta. The bones were then stored at the Royal Tyrrell Museum in Alberta.Ken Than, National Geographic News, http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/09/080925-smallest- dinosaur.htmlJeanna Bryner, MSNBC.com, http://www.nbcnews.com/id/26856262 In 2005 Nick Longrich, then a student at the University of Calgary , happened upon the small fossils while comparing Albertosaurus claws to other dinosaur species. Longrich recognized the fossils as alvarezsaurid, concluding that they represented a new species. Other fragments of Albertonykus were then recognized in the collections, which had not been identified as a separate species. Description Albertonykus borealis foraging for termites Albertonykus is the smallest known alvarezsaurid ever discovered in North America, measuring only 70 centimeters (2.5 ft) in length. Other estimates are 1.1 meters and 5 kg.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 127 Alvarezsaurs typically had slender hind legs, long rigid tails, and unusually short arms that were powerfully built to support a large claw. Although no skull bones of Albertonykus have been found, related animals from Mongolia show that they likely had long, slender snouts filled with tiny teeth similar to those of armadillos and anteaters. It is likely that Albertonykus ate insects, using its large thumb claw to tear open rotten logs to find its prey. As in other alvarezsaurs, the forelimbs of Albertonykus were specialized for digging, but were too short to permit burrowing. Unfortunately at this time the skeleton of Albertonykus is not complete, but its Mongolian relatives give us a distinct idea of what the rest of the skeleton would have looked like. Possible prey items were evaluated and compared with the fossil record of social insects. Ants were not an important part of the ecosystem during the Cretaceous, and mound-building termites do not appear until the Eocene. This leaves the possibility that Albertonykus preyed on wood-nesting termites. This hypothesis was tested by examining petrified wood from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, where Albertonykus was found. The wood found there frequently contains borings, which resemble those of termites. Classification Albertonykus is a member of an unusual theropod group known as the Alvarezsauridae and is one of only a few alvarezsaurid fossils that has been found outside of South America and Asia. After a phylogenetic analysis, it was shown that Albertonykus is the sister taxon of the Asian clade Mononykinae, which supported the hypothesis that the alvarezsaurs originated in South America, and then dispersed to Asia through North America. The unearthing of Albertonykus provided important information into the biology of the Alvarezsauridae.

Owned by Marsha Berman (Linden Realty Associates) from approximately 1960 to 2005, it was home to countless examples of low rent alternative entrepreneurialism and cultural experimentation. It also provided off-and-on illegal housing to a number of marginal types. The building itself is a two-storey, mixed-use, commercial brick building constructed somewhere around 1900. It is still in use today but is no longer owned by Berman. Enterprises Some of the better-known enterprises in this second-floor area were the Primal Plunge Bookstore (1987–1995), 88 Room art gallery (1988–1998), Naked City Coffee House, the office of Quimby Magazine (1985–1990), Garage Video (1995-2000) and the broadcast space of Radio Free Allston (1997). =The Primal Plunge Bookstore= The Primal Plunge Bookstore was founded and operated by Michael McInnis in 1987, who later sold it to Steven Svymbersky, founder of Quimby's Bookstore in Chicago. The store was primarily an outlet for the then burgeoning genre of “Zines”, self-published and usually photocopied magazines that created an outlet for a variety of D.I.Y. inclinations. Additionally, the Primal Plunge organized events in the huge central hall around which individual stores and offices were arranged. Notable events included an exhibition of paintings by convicted serial killer John Wayne Gacy, screenings of films by Nick Zedd, and a performance by punk rocker GG Allin. Jack Stevenson had a weekly series of films on various topics. The Brookline TAB, Gary S. Kadet, Around Town Culture, no date, c1990 =88 Room= 88 Room was an alternative visual arts space that concentrated on thematic and conceptually oriented exhibitions. It was founded by Andrew Guthrie, Angela Mark, and Michael Shores in 1988 (hence the name: 88 Room). After one year Mark and Shores dropped out leaving Guthrie to run the space for another nine years. The space was decidedly non-profit, addressing some of the social and cultural issues of the times, most notably the withdrawal of NEA grants from controversial artists in the late 1980s. Gaining a positive reputation among local emerging artists, the gallery was under-reported in the local media. Some notable show were “Pillow Talk”, an exhibition that addressed human sexuality, curated by the collaborative team “Dear Me Suz”: Guthrie, Cheri Eisenberg, and Ron Platt (then an assistant curator at MIT List Visual Arts Center) and “Unknown NY”, a group show curated by Winston C. Robinson that featured a hardly-known-at-the-time Karen Kilimnik. The 88 Room was incorporated as a tax exempt non-profit under the name Local Idea Council, Inc., which occasionally mounted exhibitions at the same location after 88 Room had folded. =The Naked City Coffee House= The Naked City Coffee House grew out of Naked City magazine (which for a time had offices at 107 Brighton Avenue) published by Al Nidle who later founded the Zeitgeist Gallery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Naked City Coffee House was a weekly open mic forum for singer/songwriters and poets. It is where folk singer/songwriter Dar Williams performed for the first time.Acoustic Guitar Sessions Presents Dar Williams, Published on Aug 7, 2014 =Quimby Magazine= Quimby Magazine was a monthly magazine organized by a group of local artists and friends headed by Steven Svymbersky. It shared offices with The Primal Plunge space. The magazine included comics, writing, and visual art. Svymbersky later moved to Chicago and used the name of the magazine for his bookstore. =Garage Video= Garage Video was a specialty video store that focused on hard to get B-movies and foreign films. Also, Garage video hosted video nights and live music events locally. In 1995, during the difficult first year of the business, the owner-manager of the shop, Will Colwell, was an example of an illegal tenant living in the Allston Mall. When business improved, so did his living arrangements and he moved into an apartment. =Radio Free Allston/Allston-Brighton Free Radio= Radio Free Allston was started by Steve Provizer using a 20-watt FM broadcaster bought through a mail order supplier. It was on the air from May to October 1997. Radio Free Allston broadcast from the 88 Room, which at this stage had been only intermittently producing exhibitions. The station was technically illegal, operating without a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) license, but Provizer sought to distance himself and Radio Free Allston from the descriptive “Pirate Radio” by providing a community service in the form of news programming, senior citizen shows, minority forums, and interviews with local businesses, politicians, artists, and social activists. In addition, a wide range of music programming included, but was not limited to, Hip-Hop, Latin, and all genres of Rock, Roots, and R&B.; Day-to-day operations, fund raising, equipment maintenance, and logistics depended on a core of dedicated volunteers. The station was awarded a certificate of merit by the Boston City Council, but was shut down by the FCC a few days before its first 72-hour broadcast featuring a House, Drum and Bass, Hip-Hop DJing marathon. Allston-Brighton Free Radio followed in Radio Free Allston's footsteps, a free-form AM radio station that existed off and on in the Mall from 2000 to 2005 and featured a wide array of programming.

He appeared in 83 films between 1924 and 1971. Life and career Born in Naples, Taranto started his career as a child actor in 1918 starring in some local stage companies. After studying mime and dance he joined the company of Salvatore Cafiero. In 1928 he successfully entered into the sceneggiata genre: invited on tour in the United States, he returned with \\"a pianola tape and a thousand dollars\\", used to finance his first company of variety, which lasted only fifteen days and ended in total disaster. In 1933 he debuted on dramatic theater and in revue, a genre he focused until the 1950s. Taranto achieved large notoriety thanks to two macchiette (i.e. comic musical monologues caricaturing stock characters), Ciccio Formaggio and the Baron Carlo Mazza, two caricatural characters of proven success that he reprised several times during his career. He debuted in cinema in 1938, but achieved some success just in the fifties. In 1953 he won a Nastro d'Argento for Best Actor for his performance in Luigi Zampa's Anni facili. In the sixties he was several times sidekick of Totò in a number of successful comedies and starred in numerous musicarelli films. Taranto also starred in a number of TV-films, took part to several television and radio variety shows and recorded several songs. In 1985 RAI honored the artist with a monographic documentary series in four parts, Taranto Story.

The larger yellow-rimmed brown marks are damage. The eye of a mantis shrimp has three regions, each with its own pseudopupil. In the compound eye of invertebrates such as insects and crustaceans, the pseudopupil appears as a dark spot which moves across the eye as the animal is rotated. This occurs because the ommatidia that one observes \\"head-on\\" (along their optical axes) absorb the incident light, while those to one side reflect it. The pseudopupil therefore reveals which ommatidia are aligned with the axis along which the observer is viewing.  Pseudopupil Analysis Technique  The pseudopupil analysis technique is used to study neurodegeneration in insects like Drosophila. It is especially useful for study of neurodegenerative diseases. An adult Drosophila eye consists of nearly 800 unit ommatidia which are repeated in a symmetrical pattern. Each ommatidium contains 8 photoreceptor cells each of which forms a rhabdomere (7 and 8 rhabdomere are overlapping therefore, only 7 are visible at any given plain focus). Neurodegeneration leads to loss or degradation of photoreceptors. By visualising and counting the intact rhabdomeres, degradation level can be measured. Thus, analysing the pseudopupil can permit empirical study of neurodegeneration.

The park, which was one of the first New York City parks in Manhattan on the working waterfront of the Hudson River, is named for DeWitt Clinton, who had created a business boom of Hudson commerce when he opened the Erie Canal. It is the biggest city park in the neighborhood, and since 1959, the neighborhood has frequently been referred to as \\"Clinton\\". It is the only park on the west side of Manhattan to have lighted ball fields. The park was the first community garden in New York City. History Looking north from the park toward the 59th Street Gasworks around 1910. The park's arbor (since torn down) is on the left The garden area in 1906 with the unobstructed views of the Palisades =Site= The land for the park was part of the Striker and Hopper homestead farms which had been in those families for more than 200 years. The home of General Garrit Hopper Striker built in 1752 had been torn down in 1895. Another farmhouse called the Mott farmhouse built in 1796 on 54th Street was torn down in 1896. The city announced plans to purchase the land (called \\"Sriker's Lane\\") in 1896. Other buildings on the site were torn down in 1902 and a tent was placed on the site in 1903. In 1906 the hilly terrain was graded at a cost of $200,000. At the same time, the De Witt Clinton High School opened nearby on Tenth Avenue. The park's original 1901 design by Samuel Parsons Jr. encompassed a bigger park that was much less developed than the current park. Since Navy requirements set length limits on piers, the city was able to lengthen the piers by removing land from Manhattan so that longer piers could be built that would not extend beyond the Navy limits. The park was originally and stretched nearly to the Hudson River, and it featured a recreation/bathing pavilion, gymnasium, running track, playgrounds, and a series of curving paths with viewing desks of the Hudson River and the Palisades. The park's centerpiece was a children's farm garden, which operated from 1902 to 1932. The farm, which was the first of its kind in New York City, was championed by Frances Griscom Parsons (no relation to the landscaper Samuel Parsons). It featured flower beds, observation plots, a pergola, and 356 4' × 8' vegetable gardens each assigned to a \\"little farmer\\". Parsons himself also described the park: =Development and decline= In 1930 a sculpture Flanders Field Memorial featuring a doughboy by Burt Johnson, a brother-in-law of Augustus Saint- Gaudens, was dedicated in the park. Johnson also designed a similar statue in Doughboy Park in Woodside, Queens. The gardens were discontinued in 1932 when wide swath on the west side of the park was removed to be used as part of the West Side Elevated Highway. The removed earth was transported to Central Park where it was used to fill in the Lower Reservoir for what would become the park's Great Lawn. The park's unobstructed views of the Hudson were further diminished with the construction in 1935 of the New York Passenger Ship Terminal. In the shrinking of land, a wide swath on the west of the park was removed in the 1930s for the Terminal and West Side Elevated Highway. The park's unobstructed views of the Hudson River and New Jersey Palisades have been affected by the construction of the New York Passenger Terminal (although a sidewalk along a sycamore lined curved path on the west side is a popular vantage point for viewing cruise ships at the terminal). The children's garden was removed in 1932. The undulating lawn, music stands, and lengthy arbor have been removed. In their place is a fenced-in lighted area for three baseball fields, an asphalt basketball and handball courts and a children's playground as well as a dog park. In 1959, residents sought to soften Hell's Kitchen and decided to rename the neighborhood Clinton, after the park. By the 1980s and 1990s, the area around the park had little residential population and it developed a reputation as an outpost for illegal drug use and homeless encampments. In October 1986 three teenagers murdered a homeless man in the park with a kitchen knife. Various attempts to clean the park included an instance in 1995, when a German company set up a tent for seven months on the lawn for a dinner show production of Pomp Duck and Circumstance. The company promised to pay $100,000 for improvements to the park. The dinner show was intensely opposed by residents objected to commercialization of the neighborhood lone major park (Hell's Kitchen is the jurisdiction of Manhattan Community Board 4 which ranked 57th out of 59 Community Boards for open space in New York City). Following the dinner show, the park was extensively renovated with a new Erie Canal Playground designed around a granite outcropping. Other changes included new fencing and gates so that the park could be locked at night. A dog park was added to a converted Bocce court. =Today= In 1998, legislation passed creating the Hudson River Park across Twelfth Avenue from the park along the Hudson River between 59th Street and Battery Park. The new park is a joint New York City and New York State park whereas the DeWitt Clinton Park is a city park. Currently, there is no direct connection between the two parks, as the New York Passenger Terminal is built along the entire west side. In 2005, ENK International Trade Events applied to erect a tent for two weeks in September over the handball and basketball courts in exchange for some minor repairs to the park facilities for a Fashion week event. After a subcommittee approved it, a storm of protest prompted the Community Board to veto it. Today, the park hosts sporting events as well, such as the International Quidditch Association's fourth World Cup, which was held in the park on November 13–14, 2010. Poems Flanders Field Memorial The base of the sculpture bears part of the famous poem, In Flanders Fields, If ye break faith with those who died We shall not sleep, though poppies grow On Flanders fields. However, this is a misquotation (those, not us; died, not die; and In, not On), of the actual poem by John McCrae, Take up our quarrel with the foe To you from failing hands we throw The torch; be yours to hold it high. If ye break faith with us who die We shall not sleep, though poppies grow In Flanders fields.

The Northern Reaches Restoration Group is a waterway society in Lancashire and Cumbria, England, UK. The purpose of the NRRG is to campaign for the re-opening of the final 14-mile stretch of the Lancaster Canal between Tewitfield Locks and Kendal. The Northern Reaches, as they are so named, became isolated from the rest of the canal following the construction of the M6 motorway in the 1960s. The navigation authority for the waterway is the Canal & River Trust, formerly British Waterways. Background By the 1940s large parts of the British canal network had begun to be abandoned as freight moved on to road transport. The northern part of the Lancaster Canal was no exception, with certain sections being filled in and other parts allowed to drain (dewater). While the canal between Preston and Tewitfield remained classed as a \\"cruising waterway\\", the Northern Reaches was deemed to be \\"remainder waterway\\" (i.e. obsolete) following a 1955 Act of Parliament. Despite some local opposition, highway engineers building the UK's new motorway system therefore had little interest in protecting the permanent way of the canal; construction of embankments and a culvert completely blocked the original route. Purpose Since the 1960s, the Lancaster Canal Trust and the Inland Waterways Association recognised the value of preserving inland waterways. Both groups lobbied for the restoration of this northern stretch of canal to navigable standard. In the 1990s the NRRG was specifically formed to continue the campaign for the waterway's restoration. These aims include increasing awareness and promoting interest amongst local communities and all potential users (boaters, walkers, cyclists, and anglers) of the historic waterway. The NRRG is also committed to maintaining the surviving canal infrastructure found along the route of the Northern Reaches. As a result of its efforts, many of the original structures have been protected, further loss to cruising waterway has halted, and improvements have been made to the towpath by erecting interpretative panels at various sites along the disused canal. Restoration partnership The NRRG is part of the Lancaster Canal Restoration Partnership based at Levens Hall, Kendal. This is an umbrella organisation that brings together all organisations that support the canal's restoration. They are: *Canal & River Trust *Cumbria County Council *Inland Waterways Association *Kendal Town Council *Lancashire County Council *Lancaster Canal Trust *Lancaster City Council *South Lakeland District Council *Waterways Trust Additional support is provided by the Waterway Recovery Group.

History The line was opened in 1850–51 with a station at Launton some two miles away. The original intention had been to call this station Poundon Bridge, however the name never seems to have been used. Marsh Gibbon and Poundon opened on 7 August 1880. The era of extravagantly designed and built country stations had long passed, and what was provided were simple but practical timber buildings without awnings. Oddly the station still retained the low platforms of earlier stations on the line. Even though there were proposals to raise them in the early 20th century, they remained until closure. Small moveable steps had to be provided to allow passengers to board and alight easily. left Another feature was the bay window in the main building which was on the down Oxford platform. This projected out onto the platform since it was the signal box. There was a clock in the centre which was visible on the platforms as required by the Board of Trade. There was a small waiting shed on the up Bletchley-bound platform, and a single siding off the down, running at an angle in front of the main building At grouping in 1923 it became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway; it duly passed to British Railways in 1948, as part of the London Midland Region. Diesel trains were provided for passenger services from 2 November 1959. The station stopped handling goods traffic on 2 November 1964; the signalbox was closed in January 1965 and passenger services were withdrawn when the whole of the route from Bletchley to Oxford closed on 1 January 1968.

It was hosted on Myspace as part of Dark Horse Presents. It won a 2008 Eisner Award for best digital comic. The comic is about a struggling rock band that goes on zany, sci-fi oriented adventures. The tone of the comic is light and humorous. The band is anchored by a spunky, red-haired Asian girl named Dandelion who really hates Vikings (despite probably being one) and engages in nonsensical discussions that sometimes turn out to be true. Issue 1:Sugarshock!: Battle Royal With Cheese Issue 1 starts off with unnamed band singing a song that incorporates the \\"I'm rubber, you're glue, everything you say bounces off of me and sticks to you\\" mantra. Dandelion is singing, a robot and L'Lihdra playing guitar, and Wade playing drums. After an unspecified period of time, Dandelion anxiously wait backstage to hear the winners of \\"the South Fairville Hormer's Shrimp 'N' Taco Rock-Off\\", which they hope to win, but they lose to a solo act by the name of \\"Sensitive Guy\\", whom Dandelion thinks \\"was great\\". On the ride home, Dandelion cries and asks rhetorically \\"...Why do we fail...?\\" despite being comforted by their groupie (who is later revealed to be a mechanic), \\"I thought you guys kicked ass.\\", whom Wade, the band's drummer, is planning to use for sex. Wade silences him, saying \\"You remember you're not allowed to talk until after I've used you for sex, right?\\". L'Lihdra then calmly blames Dandelion for their defeat, saying that she was \\"offkey on the chorus of 'God bites Man.' In this way, we were denied the victory\\", much to the shock of everyone in the car and to the anger of Dandelion. Dandelion accuses L'Lihdra of calling her a Viking. This starts a heated argument that is cut short when an unknown object(s) lands on the roof of the car with much force.

Stylistically a simplistic yet monumental structure, it is located on 2 Vitosha Boulevard, surrounded by Alabin Street, Laveleye Street and Positano Street. The need for a common building to house all the courts in Sofia was raised in 1926 with the foundation of the Judicial Buildings fund. Construction began in 1929 and finished in 1940. While it was the first structure in this strict monumental style in the city, it was followed by the Bulgarian National Bank in the 1930s and the Largo in the 1950s. The initial architectural plan was the work of Nikola Lazarov, later redesigned by Pencho Koychev. The Court House has a syenite plinth, a facing of white limestone and a noticeable cornice below the top floor. The four-storey building (with two additional underground floors) spreads over a ground area of 8,500 square metres and has 430 premises, of which 24 courtrooms, a library and a bank hall, totalling 48,000 square metres of used area. The facade features five large gates and 12 columns. In its style, the Court House is eclectic, uniting several Classical themes, with a fourth floor instead of a baluster, as well as Roman and Byzantine style decorations on the doors, windows and corbels.

He won 15 caps for Wales and played county rugby for Glamorgan. Rugby career Jones, along with Dicky Owen, created one of the most devastating half-back pairings to play for Swansea. Known as the 'Dancing Dicks',Smith (1980), pg 133. Jones and Owen replaced the James brothers for Swansea, and would later bring their partnership to the Welsh team. The Welsh selectors tended to choose club pairings at half back, and when Newport's Lou Phillips was injured in a match against Scotland, he and his partner Llewellyn Lloyd were gradually replaced by Jones and Owen.Smith (1980), pg 131-132. The partnership would last for 15 games, a Welsh record for half-backs that was unbeaten until Barry John and Gareth Edwards in 1971.Thomas (1979) pg.32. Jones played for Swansea for 12 seasons and was a member of the 'All White' team that beat the touring Australians in 1908. Jones made his debut against Ireland in 1901. Although dropped for a time between 1902 and 1904, he reestablished himself with some excellent kicking and running against Scotland. Unfortunately for Jones he broke his instep in a club game in 1905 and did not play rugby again until late 1907. His return in 1908 was against France in a Grand Slam decider, Jones scored the winning try to lift the trophy for Wales. Jones scored two other tries in his international career, against Scotland in 1904 and England in 1905. Jones should have also scored against Ireland, which would have given him a try against all the tournament teams, but had a try disallowed in the 1903/04 season in Belfast through poor refereeing.Parry-Jones (1999) p 113. In 1911 Owen and Jones were dropped after a terrible Welsh display against England, in which Jones was constantly harried throughout the game by England's wing-forward, 'Cherry' Pillman.Smith (1980), pg 197. Wales only lost the match 11-6, mainly due to a first minute error by Bridgend's Benjamin \\"Ben\\" Gronow that allowed England to score, but Wales couldn't get back into the game. The fact that this was the first time a Welsh team had lost to England since 1898 gave the selectors a big enough reason to change personnel for the next few matches. Although Owen would be selected again, Jones suffered a serious accident that ended his playing career. =International matches played= WalesSmith (1980), pg 468. * 1908 * 1902, 1904, 1905, 1909, 1910 * 1905, 1908, 1909, 1910 * 1901, 1904, 1908, 1909 * 1904, 1909 Personal history Jones is the great-grandfather of New Zealand comedian Dai Henwood.

The text is notoriously difficult to understand and its corresponding translations do not allow an unambiguous interpretation. There is no real agreement either about the meaning or the value of the number. It also has been called the \\"geometrical number\\" or the \\"nuptial number\\" (the \\"number of the bride\\"). The passage in which Plato introduced the number has been discussed ever since it was written, with no consensus in the debate. As for the number's actual value, 216 is the most frequently proposed value for it, but 3,600 or 12,960,000 are also commonly considered. An incomplete listfor more names and references see Dupuis J., Le Nombre Geometrique de Platon, Paris: Hachette, 1885 of authors who mention or discourse about includes the names of Aristotle, Proclus for antiquity; Ficino and Cardano during the Renaissance; Zeller, Friedrich Schleiermacher, Paul Tannery and Friedrich Hultsch in the 19th century and further new names are currently added.McNamee K., and Jacovides M., Annotations to the Speech of the Muses (Plato \\"Republic\\" 546B-C), Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik, Bd. 144, (2003), pp. 31-50 Further in the Republic (9.587b) another number is mentioned, known as the \\"Number of the Tyrant\\". Plato's text Great lexical and syntactical differences are easily noted between the many translations of the Republic. Below is a typical text from a relatively recent translation of Republic 546b-c: > \\"Now for divine begettings there is a period comprehended by a perfect > number, and for mortal by the first in which augmentations dominating and > dominated when they have attained to three distances and four limits of the > assimilating and the dissimilating, the waxing and the waning, render all > things conversable and commensurable [546c] with one another, whereof a > basal four-thirds wedded to the pempad yields two harmonies at the third > augmentation, the one the product of equal factors taken one hundred times, > the other of equal length one way but oblong,-one dimension of a hundred > numbers determined by the rational diameters of the pempad lacking one in > each case, or of the irrational lacking two; the other dimension of a > hundred cubes of the triad. And this entire geometrical number is > determinative of this thing, of better and inferior births.\\"Translation by > Paul Shorey, Plato: The Collected Dialogues, Eds. Edith Hamilton & > Huntington Cairns, Princeton University Press, Princeton, N. J., 1961, > (p.775) The 'entire geometrical number', mentioned shortly before the end of this text, is understood to be Plato's number. The introductory words mention (a period comprehended by) 'a perfect number' which is taken to be a reference to Plato's perfect year mentioned in his Timaeus (39d). The words are presented as uttered by the muses, so the whole passage is sometimes called the 'speech of the muses' or something similar.Erhardt E., The word of the muses, Classical Quarterly (New Series) (1986), 36: 407-420 Indeed, Philip Melanchthon compared it to the proverbial obscurity of the Sibyls.Selectae declamationes. Declamatio de periodis imperiorum, v.3, p. 722, Strasbourg, 1559 Cicero famously described it as 'obscure' but others have seen some playfulness in its tone. Interpretations An illustrated interpretation of Plato's number as Shortly after Plato's time his meaning apparently did not cause puzzlement as Aristotle's casual remark attests.Aristotle, Politics, Book V, 12, 8: \\"He only says that nothing is abiding, but that all things change in a certain cycle: and that the origin of the change is a base of numbers which are in the ratio of 4:3 and this when combined with a figure of five gives two harmonies: he means when the number of this figure becomes solid.\\" Half a millennium later, however, it was an enigma for the Neoplatonists, who had a somewhat mystic penchant and wrote frequently about it, proposing geometrical and numerical interpretations. Next, for nearly a thousand years, Plato's texts disappeared and it is only in the Renaissance that the enigma briefly resurfaced. During the 19th century, when classical scholars restored original texts, the problem reappeared. Schleiermacher interrupted his edition of Plato for a decade while attempting to make sense of the paragraph. Victor Cousin inserted a note that it has to be skipped in his French translation of Plato's works. In the early 20th century, scholarly findings suggested a Babylonian origin for the topic.Barton G., On the Babylonian Origin of Plato's Nuptial Number, Journal of the American Oriental Society, v.29, (1908), p.210-9 Most interpreters argue that the value of Plato's number is 216 because it is the cube of 6, i.e. , which is remarkable for also being the sum of the cubes for the Pythagorean triple (3, 4, 5): . Such considerations tend to ignore the second part of the text where some other numbers and their relations are described. The opinions tend to converge about their values being 480,000 and 270,000 but there is little agreement about the details. It has been noted that 6 yields 1296 and .

Early and personal life Laura Camaur was born on 5 January 1913, in Trieste, then part of Austria-Hungary. She was the daughter of sculptor and artist Antonio Camaur (1875-1919) and his wife, Maria Taucer. In addition to being prominent in Triestine art and intellectual circles, Antonio Camaur was a prominent Irredentist and advocated annexation of Trieste by Italy. In late 1915, Camaur went into exile because of his pro-Italian sympathies, and Laura lived in Northern Italy until her family's return to Trieste in 1919. After World War I, Laura Camaur came under the tutelage of the Taucer family who sent her to be educated in Vienna. In 1930, she married an older Hungarian army officer, Oscar Szemere, but the couple separated after his business failed. They were divorced in Reno, Nevada, in 1940. Camaur later married Arthur Roper Caldbeck, a colonel in the British army. Film career Camaur was spotted by a talent scout, who was taken by her beauty, at a function at the La Scala theater in Milan. She was recruited as a motion picture actress by the fledgling Italian film industry and acquired the stage name \\"Laura Solari\\". Beginning with Regina della Scala in 1936, she appeared in 30 films between 1936 and 1969. Solari participated in the legitimate stage in Trieste's Nuovo Teatro. She also appeared on television in programs such as the 1955 drama television series Police Call. Solari retired in 1969 and moved to Switzerland. She died in Bellinzona, Ticino, Switzerland on 13 September 1983, survived by three sons.

Ukrainian vyshyvanka is distinguished by local embroidery features specific to Ukrainian embroidery. Vyshyvanka is not present in the traditional Russian women's costume with the sarafan consisting of a long full skirt hanging just below the arms with straps or an extremely abbreviated bodice that secures it over the shoulders. Etymology In English translations of Ukrainian texts, the word \\"vyshyvanka\\" is a loanword. Same way as kilt speaks about its Scottish origin, or moccasins attribute to American Indians heritage, vyshyvanka proudly defines Ukrainian people. The term originated from the word \\"vyshyvka\\" meaning \\"stitch patterns\\". In Ukraine=Embroidery= The embroidery is a fundamental element of the Ukrainian folk costume. Ukrainian vyshyvanka is distinguished by local embroidery features specific to Ukrainian embroidery: In Ukrainian embroidery, black, red, and white colours are basic, and yellow, blue, and green are supplementary. On the territory of Ukraine, embroidery existed already in the 5th century B.C, and was a creation of Scythian fine art. Ukraine is famous throughout the world for its highly artistic embroidery. It is important for the embroiderer today to use folk art as a source without altering stitches or colours because every change devalues a piece of embroidery and distorts it. =Artistic influence=Other national dresses Southern Russian dress, which shows a propensity for bright, polychromatic garments, was most certainly affected by the influence of vividly coloured Ukrainian costume from the significant influx of Ukrainian settlers since the 17th century. High fashion During Paris Fashion Week 2015, Ukrainian fashion designer Vita Kin was featured in Vogue magazine and Harper's Bazaar for introducing vyshyvankas as modern Bohemian style designs that attracted fashion icons like Anna Dello Russo, Miroslava Duma, and Leandra Medine. In its US May issue Vogue wrote that the vyshyvanka has \\"made waves far past the Eastern European country\\".

Queen Máxima of the Netherlands wore a vyshyvanka dress when visiting the 2016 Summer Olympics. =Meaning=Traditional beliefs Vyshyvanka is used as a talisman to protect the person wearing it and to tell a story. A geometric pattern weaved in the past by adding red or black threads into the light threads, which was later imitated by embroidery, was believed having the power to protect a person from all harm. Patriotism Archduke Wilhelm wearing a vyshyvanka Archduke Wilhelm of Austria was a Ukrainian patriot who preferred wearing the vyshyvanka and was therefore known in Ukrainian as Vasyl Vyshyvanyi (Basil the Embroidered). The Vyshyvanoho Square was named in his honour in the city of Lviv. Vyshyvanka and other national symbols became extremely popular in Ukraine following Euromaidan, including in LGBT+ communities signalling their belonging to the nation. Celebration Vyshyvanka Day originated in 2006 at Chernivtsi National University by its student Lesya Voronyuk and gradually became international as the International Day of Vyshyvanka. It is celebrated on the third Thursday of May. It is intended to unite all Ukrainians over the world, regardless of religion, language they speak or their place of residence. It is a flash mob holiday, which is not attached to any public holiday or feast day. On this day many Ukrainians wear vyshyvankas to demonstrate commitment to the idea of national identity and unity and to show their patriotism. State officials, including municipal, court, and the government officials and the head of the state, may take part in celebration.

The Polar Urals tend to the northeast and the Usa runs parallel to them. It is in the Komi Republic of Russia and the largest tributary of the Pechora, which it joins from the right. It is long, with a drainage basin of . The Usa has an average discharge of , but this varies from a maximum of in June to a minimum of in April. It freezes over in October or November and is icebound until the spring thaw begins in May or June. Its largest tributaries are, from the left: Yelets, Lemva, Bolshoy Kochmes and Kosyu, and from the right: Vorkuta, Syoyda, Adzva and Kolva. The river has its sources in the northern Ural Mountains, and it flows towards the southwest, roughly parallel to the mountain range. The main river is formed by the confluence of the Bolshaya Usa (Large Usa) and the Malaya Usa (Little Usa) some 30 km east of Vorkuta. The two tributaries are steep, with many rapids and waterfalls. After the confluence the main river is calm, with only a few rapids in its upper sections. Its banks here are high and cliff-like, but further downriver they become lower, wooded and boggy, except for a section around the settlement of Adak (Russian: Адак), where the river cuts through the Chernyshov Hills. Below the settlement of Sivomaskinsky (Russian: Сивомаскинский) the river gets much wider, and in its lower reaches it is from wide. It also starts forming meanders and sand islands, and it keeps this appearance all the way to its mouth. Some from its mouth lies the town of Usinsk and the river port of Parma. The Usa flows into the Pechora River at the settlement of Ust-Usa. The river is navigable upstream from its mouth, and there are river ports at Abez, Petrun, Makarikha, Parma and Ust- Usa. Within the Usa basin is the large Pechora coalfield, and in its lower parts, by the town of Usinsk, there are several big petroleum and natural gas fields. The Usa valley has been inhabited for 40,000 years, as evidenced by the archaeological site Mamontovaya Kurya (Russian: Мамонтовой Курьи, \\"the mammoth curve\\"). With the Russian conquest of Siberia it became one of the main routes into Siberia. The route ran from the Pechora, which connects to other rivers in northern Russia, up the Usa, across the low Kamen Portage and down the Sob River to Ob River where there were customhouses at the Sob barrier and Obdorsk. During the short summer season this route was preferred by west-bound travellers since most of the sailing was down-river. For other Ural crossings see Verkhoturye.

They lived in refugee camps in neighbouring countries, mainly Sudan and Kenya, some for as long as 20 years before they found a country willing to resettle them. More left as refugees after Eritrea gained independence in 1993. The United States, rather than Australia, was the first- choice destination for most refugees; as a result, the Ethiopians in Australia tend to have less educational background and occupational skills than Ethiopian populations who relocated elsewhere. The peak of Ethiopian refugee resettlement to Australia came in 2003, when 700 came to the country. Late in the following year, 350 more Ethiopians from the Abu Rakham camp in Sudan, largely single or widowed mothers and their families, were resettled in Australia. These were mostly Christians of Amhara and Tigray descent. In total, about 3,000 Ethiopians settled in Australia between 2000 and 2005. Numbers and distribution According to the 2006 Australian census 5,633 Australians were born in Ethiopia while 5,600 claimed Ethiopian ancestry, either alone or with another ancestry. The similar figures for ancestry and place of birth are indicative of the very recent immigration of this group. Australia's 2001 census found about 3,600 residents of the country who reported their place of birth as Ethiopia. This made them the 15th-largest group of Ethiopian-born people in a country outside of Ethiopia, ahead of the United Arab Emirates and behind Norway. About 85% of those lived in Melbourne, alongside communities of immigrants from other countries in the Horn of Africa, mainly Eritrea and Somalia; they are primarily settled in Footscray and neighbouring suburbs such as Ascot Vale, Braybrook, Flemington, Kensington, and Sunshine. Other communities of Ethiopians can be found in New South Wales and Tasmania. Education and employment According to the 2011 Census, 51.3 per cent of Ethiopia-born Australians 15 years and over in age had some form of higher non-school qualifications. 19.7 per cent of the Ethiopia-born aged 15 years and over were still attending an educational institution. Ethiopia-born individuals in Australia aged 15 years and over participated in the labour force at a rate of 62.3 per cent; the unemployment rate was 15 per cent. Of the 3,775 Ethiopia-born immigrants who were employed, 26.2 per cent worked in a professional, skilled managerial or trade occupation. In Footscray, some have set up ethnic-oriented businesses, such as hair salons, clothing shops, and restaurants with a mostly Ethiopian customer base. Religion Religious divisions among migrants from Ethiopia follow ethnic lines. The Amhara and Tigray are largely members of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church while the Gurage are almost evenly divided between members of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and followers of Islam. Most Oromo are Muslim or members of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church or various Pentecostal churches, and the Harari and Afar are almost all Muslims. There were two Ethiopian Pentecostal churches in the Melbourne area as of 2001, as well as an Ethiopian Orthodox church in Maribyrnong. However, there were no mosques specifically devoted to Muslims from Ethiopia; instead, they worship alongside believers from other countries.

Founded in 1967 as a manufacturer of shutters, it currently operates its own extrusion facilities in twelve countries. It also operates representative offices in more than forty countries, including the United Arab Emirates and India. History VEKA was founded in 1967 in Sendenhorst, West Germany, as Vekaplast, initially only producing roller shutters. Two years later, Heinrich Laumann, one of the company's eight employees at the time, purchased the company. In 1970, VEKA began work on designing their own window profile, which they released in 1971. In 1974, VEKA began producing front doors and sliding door systems. Having outgrown their rented 15,000 square foot factory, the company purchased 115,000 square meters of land at an industrial site in Sendenhorst to build a new extrusion factory. In 1977, the first 10,500 square meters of the company's new factory was completed. Extensions to the factory were added onto it in 1979 and 1980, tripling its size to 31,500 square meters. In 1981, VEKA opened its first mixing plant in Sendenhorst. In 1983, due to economic stagnation in West Germany, VEKA decided to increase its exports to foreign markets, establishing subsidiaries in Spain, France, and the United States within a year. In 1985, the company began manufacturing PVC sheets. In 1986, VEKA established a subsidiary in the United Kingdom, which quickly began production for the British market. It also acquired the Belgian PVC and PE foil producers Isoblec, Azotherm, and ACE. The factory in Sendenhorst was expanded with a powerful mixing plant and a production hall for more sheet extruders. In 1990, VEKA incorporated under the name of VEKA GmbH. The next year, the company established a waste management subsidiary called VEKA Umwelttechnik GmbH in Behringen, Germany. In 1992, VEKA GmbH became a public limited company, with the Laumann family keeping their control over the company. In 1993, VEKA opened a 120,000 square meter recycling center. They also established the subsidiary VEKA West, Inc. in Reno, Nevada to serve the Western United States. VEKA Holdings Inc. was also created to manage VEKA's operations in the United States. Between 1994 and 1999, VEKA established subsidiaries in Poland, Russia, Argentina, and Singapore. In 1999, VEKA celebrated their 30th anniversary, with 2,200 guests from 37 countries attending. Heinrich Laumann received honorary citizenship from the city of Sendenhorst and was decorated by the Federal Republic of Germany for his entrepreneurial performance. In 2000, Heinrich Laumann stepped down from the Board of Directors and became the chairman of the Supervisory Board. Hubert Hecker was named the new chairman of the Board of Directors. That year, VEKA established subsidiaries in Romania, Mexico, and Brazil. In 2002, VEKA Holdings Inc. acquired the Canadian extruder Berlinex, renaming it to VEKA Canada Holdings Comp. Between 2003 and 2006, subsidiaries were established in India, Malaysia, and Ukraine. In 2006, VEKA established VEKA South in Terrell, Texas to serve the Southern United States, Central America, and the Caribbean.

The Lüneburg Heath consists of pushed moraines made from Neogene sand deposits. These form nutrient-poor soils and are generally shrublands covered in heaths. A push moraine or pushed moraine is in geomorphology a moraine (a landform formed by glacial processes) that forms when the terminus advance of a lowland glacier pushes unstratified glacial sediment into a pile or linear ridge in front of it. A push moraine is identified by its ability to push sediment upwards from its original horizontal position. Push moraines are limited in size by the advance of a glacier front and its tendency to shear over the top of any ridge large enough to resist the movement of ice. Pushed moraines generally occur in low, flat plains at higher latitudes and were formed during the glacial stages of the Quaternary ice age. They can be up to 100 km long and several hundreds of metres in height. Pushed moraines can be found in the North American plains, in Siberia and in Northern Europe. They were formed during cool, glacial stages, when glaciers advanced and covered large parts of North America and Eurasia. In some regions pushed moraines of more than one glacial stage can be recognised, or different generations from a single glacial phase. Since new glacial advances tend to destroy older pushed moraines, most were formed during the last (110,000 to 10,000 years ago) or second-last (238,000 to 128,000 years ago) glacial advances. Today push moraines can be found anywhere an advancing glacier is pushing sediment into a ridge at the terminus. Examples can be found in Alaska.

The Musée national des Monuments Français is today a museum of plaster casts of French monuments located in the Palais de Chaillot, 1, place du Trocadéro et du 11 Novembre, Paris, France. It now forms part of the Cité de l'Architecture et du Patrimoine, and is open daily except Tuesday. An admission fee is charged. The collection was a re-founding in plaster of a collection opened in 1795 by Alexandre Lenoir as the Musée des monuments français of actual monuments of French Medieval and Renaissance art, removed from churches and châteaux after the French Revolution. This remained open until the Bourbon Restoration of 1816, and was highly influential on French taste, making the medievalism of the Troubadour style popular, and providing inspiration to its artists. History Jean-Lubin Vauzelle: The Musée des Monuments français in the chapel of the Petits Augustins convent in 1795. = Alexandre Lenoir = Molding of the portal of the Church of Saint-Pierre d'Aulnay, Aulnay-de- Saintonge, mid-12th century. In 1795, Alexandre Lenoir opened the Musée des monuments français to the public in the Petits Augustins convent, now the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, and served as its administrator for 30 years, but he had to restore most of its collections to their former private and public owners on the Bourbon Restoration in 1816.Stara 2013. What remained would be partly moved to the Louvre in 1824 (in the galerie d'Angoulême under the generic term of musée de la sculpture française) and partly to the musée de Versailles in 1836. = Viollet-le-Duc = The architect Eugène Viollet-le- Duc suggested gathering reproductions of French sculpture and architecture at a single site in the palais du Trocadéro in 1879, in buildings left vacant after the Exposition universelle in 1878. His proposal was accepted on 4 November. Alexandre du Sommerard would be designated on 20 December to form the musée de la Sculpture comparée. The institution opened its four rooms to the public on 28 May 1882, three more in 1886 and finally its library and foundational documents in 1889. The palais du Trocadéro, refaced and widened by a second gallery but deprived of its central hemispherical hall, under the direction of architect Jacques Carlu for the Exposition universelle of 1937, became the palais de Chaillot. Wholly redesigned, the museum became the musée des Monuments français. Very avant-garde in terms of its museographic conception and intellectual experimentation, notably through the efforts of the archaeologist Paul Deschamps, it had to close down due to an insufficient budget. In July 1995, a fire partially destroyed the building. Its planned reopening in 1998 was pushed back to 15 September 2007 in connection with the creation of the Cité de l'Architecture et du Patrimoine. =Today= Galerie Carlu It occupies the aile Paris of the Palais de Chaillot and is made up of three galleries. The galerie Davioud (1878) and galerie Carlu (1937) form a gallery of plaster casts. The upper gallery serves as an exhibition space for modern and contemporary architectural models. Wall paintings and stained glass windows are located at the end of the modern and contemporary architecture gallery; they are shown on two levels. There is also a library as well as rooms for temporary exhibitions. Collections It contains about 6,000 casts of sculptures of all periods including ancient Greece, Italy, Germany, and Switzerland, but with a strong emphasis on French sculptures of the Romanesque and Gothic periods. It also contains scale models of buildings, copies of architectural elements, sculpture, frescoes, and stained glass from French churches and châteaux, as well as a collection of about 200,000 photographs. Most copies were made in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Of particular interest is the Galerie Davioud, which displays casts of sculptures from the Strasbourg Cathedral (13th century), Bourges Cathedral (late 13th century), and the Notre-Dame de Reims. The museum also contains copies of elements from Angoulême Cathedral, Aulnay, Autun, Cluny, Conques, Jouarre, Moissac, Sainte- Marie-des-Dames at Saintes, Saint-Gilles-du-Gard, Saint-Trophime d'Arles, Saint-Génis-des-Fontaines, Saint-Sernin at Toulouse, and Notre-Dame du Port at Clermont-Ferrand.

Michael Foale can be seen exercising in the foreground. Weightlessness is the complete or near-complete absence of the sensation of weight. This is also termed zero-G, although the more correct term is \\"zero G-force\\". It occurs in the absence of any contact forces upon objects including the human body. Weight is a measurement of the force on an object at rest in a relatively strong gravitational field (such as on the surface of the Earth). These weight-sensations originate from contact with supporting floors, seats, beds, scales, and the like. A sensation of weight is also produced, even when the gravitational field is zero, when contact forces act upon and overcome a body's inertia by mechanical, non- gravitational forces- such as in a centrifuge, a rotating space station, or within an accelerating vehicle. When the gravitational field is non-uniform, a body in free fall experiences tidal effects and is not stress-free. Near a black hole, such tidal effects can be very strong. In the case of the Earth, the effects are minor, especially on objects of relatively small dimensions (such as the human body or a spacecraft) and the overall sensation of weightlessness in these cases is preserved. This condition is known as microgravity, and it prevails in orbiting spacecraft. Weightlessness in Newtonian mechanics In the left half, the spring is far away from any gravity source. In the right half, it is in a uniform gravitation field. a) Zero gravity and weightless b) Zero gravity but not weightless (Spring is rocket propelled) c) Spring is in free fall and weightless d) Spring rests on a plinth and has both weight1 and weight2. In Newtonian mechanics the term \\"weight\\" is given two distinct interpretations by engineers. :Weight1: Under this interpretation, the \\"weight\\" of a body is the gravitational force exerted on the body and this is the notion of weight that prevails in engineering. Near the surface of the earth, a body whose mass is has a weight of approximately , independent of its state of motion, free fall, or not. Weightlessness in this sense can be achieved by removing the body far away from the source of gravity. It can also be attained by placing the body at a neutral point between two gravitating masses. : Weight2: Weight can also be interpreted as that quantity which is measured when one uses scales. What is being measured there is the force exerted by the body on the scales. In a standard weighing operation, the body being weighed is in a state of equilibrium as a result of a force exerted on it by the weighing machine cancelling the gravitational field. By Newton's 3rd law, there is an equal and opposite force exerted by the body on the machine. This force is called weight2. The force is not gravitational. Typically, it is a contact force and not uniform across the mass of the body. If the body is placed on the scales in a lift (an elevator) in free fall in pure uniform gravity, the scale would read zero, and the body said to be weightless i.e. its weight2 = 0. This describes the condition in which the body is stress free and undeformed. This is the weightlessness in free fall in a uniform gravitational field. (The situation is more complicated when the gravitational field is not uniform, or, when a body is subject to multiple forces which may, for instance, cancel each other and produce a state of stress albeit weight2 being zero. See below.) To sum up, we have two notions of weight of which weight1 is dominant. Yet 'weightlessness' is typically exemplified not by absence of weight1 but by the absence of stress associated with weight2. This is the intended sense of weightlessness in what follows below. A body is stress free, exerts zero weight2, when the only force acting on it is weight1 as when in free fall in a uniform gravitational field. Without subscripts, one ends up with the odd- sounding conclusion that a body is weightless when the only force acting on it is its weight. The apocryphal apple that fell on Newton's head can be used to illustrate the issues involved. An apple weighs approximately . This is the weight1 of the apple and is considered to be a constant even while it is falling. During that fall, its weight2 however is zero: ignoring air resistance, the apple is stress free. When it hits Newton, the sensation felt by Newton would depend upon the height from which the apple falls and weight2 of the apple at the moment of impact may be many times greater than . It is this weight2 which distorts the apple. On its way down, the apple in its free fall does not suffer any distortion as the gravitational field is uniform. = Stress during free fall = #In a uniform gravitational field: Consider any cross-section dividing the body into two parts. Both parts have the same acceleration and the force exerted on each is supplied by the external source of the field. There is no force exerted by one part on the other. Stress at the cross-section is zero. Weight2 is zero. #In a non-uniform gravitational field: Under gravity alone, one part of the body may have a different acceleration from another part. This would tend to deform the body and generate internal stresses if the body resists deformation. Weight2 is not 0. Throughout this discussion on using stress as an indicator of weight, any pre- stress which may exist within a body caused by a force exerted on one part by another is not relevant. The only relevant stresses are those generated by external forces applied to the body. The definition and use of 'weightlessness' is difficult unless it is understood that the sensation of \\"weight\\" in everyday terrestrial experience results not from gravitation acting alone (which is not felt), but instead by the mechanical forces that resist gravity. An object in a straight free fall, or in a more complex inertial trajectory of free fall (such as within a reduced gravity aircraft or inside a space station), all experience weightlessness, since they do not experience the mechanical forces that cause the sensation of weight. =Force fields other than gravity= As noted above, weightlessness occurs when # no resultant force acts on the object # uniform gravity acts solely by itself. For the sake of completeness, a 3rd minor possibility has to be added. This is that a body may be subject to a field which is not gravitational but such that the force on the object is uniformly distributed across the object's mass. An electrically charged body, uniformly charged, in a uniform electric field is a possible example. Electric charge here replaces the usual gravitational charge. Such a body would then be stress free and be classed as weightless. Various types of levitation may fall into this category, at least approximately. =Weightlessness and proper acceleration= A body in free fall (which by definition entails no aerodynamic forces) near the surface of the earth has an acceleration approximately equal to with respect to a coordinate frame tied to the earth. If the body is in a freely falling lift and subject to no pushes or pulls from the lift or its contents, the acceleration with respect to the lift would be zero. If on the other hand, the body is subject to forces exerted by other bodies within the lift, it will have an acceleration with respect to the freely falling lift. This acceleration which is not due to gravity is called \\"proper acceleration\\". On this approach, weightlessness holds when proper acceleration is zero. = Ways to avoid weightlessness = Weightlessness is in contrast with current human experiences in which a non-uniform force is acting, such as: *standing on the ground, sitting in a chair on the ground, etc., where gravity is countered by the support force of the ground, *flying in a plane, where a support force is transmitted from the lift the wings provide (special trajectories which form an exception are described below), *during atmospheric reentry, or during the use of a parachute, when atmospheric drag decelerates a vehicle, *during an orbital maneuver in a spacecraft, or during the launch phase, when rocket engines provide thrust. In cases where an object is not weightless, as in the above examples, a force acts non-uniformly on the object in question. Aero- dynamic lift, drag, and thrust are all non-uniform forces (they are applied at a point or surface, rather than acting on the entire mass of an object), and thus create the phenomenon of weight. This non-uniform force may also be transmitted to an object at the point of contact with a second object, such as the contact between the surface of the Earth and one's feet, or between a parachute harness and one's body. Tidal forces Two rigid cubes joined by an elastic string in free fall near a black hole. The string stretches as the body falls to the right. Tidal forces arise when the gravitational field is not uniform and gravitation gradients exist. Such indeed is the norm and strictly speaking any object of finite size even in free-fall is subject to tidal effects. These are impossible to remove by inertial motion, except at one single nominated point of the body. The Earth is in free fall but the presence of tides indicates that it is in a non-uniform gravitational field. This non-uniformity is more due to the moon than the sun. The total gravitational field due to the sun is much stronger than that of the moon but it has a minor tidal effect compared with that of the moon because of the relative distances involved. Weight1 of the earth is essentially due to the sun's gravity. But its state of stress and deformation, represented by the tides, is more due to non uniformity in the gravitational field of the nearby moon. When the size of a region being considered is small relative to its distance from the gravitating mass the assumption of uniform gravitational field holds to a good approximation. Thus a person is small relative to the radius of Earth and the field for a person at the surface of the earth is approximately uniform. The field is strictly not uniform and is responsible for the phenomenon of microgravity. Objects near a black hole are subject to a highly non-uniform gravitational field. Frames of reference In all inertial reference frames, while weightlessness is experienced, Newton's first law of motion is obeyed locally within the frame. Inside the frame (for example, inside an orbiting ship or free-falling elevator), unforced objects keep their velocity relative to the frame. Objects not in contact with other objects \\"float\\" freely. If the inertial trajectory is influenced by gravity, the reference frame will be an accelerated frame as seen from a position outside the gravitational attraction, and (seen from far away) the objects in the frame (elevator, etc.) will appear to be under the influence of a force (the so-called force of gravity). As noted, objects subject solely to gravity do not feel its effects. Weightlessness can thus be realised for short periods of time in an airplane following a specific elliptic flight path, often mistakenly called a parabolic flight. It is simulated poorly, with many differences, in neutral buoyancy conditions, such as immersion in a tank of water. Zero-g, \\"zero gravity\\", accelerometers Zero-g is an alternative term for weightlessness and holds for instance in a freely falling lift. Zero-g is subtly different from the complete absence of gravity, something which is impossible due to the presence of gravity everywhere in the universe. \\"Zero-gravity\\" may also be used to mean effective weightlessness, neglecting tidal effects. Microgravity (or µg) is used to refer to situations that are substantially weightless but where g-force stresses within objects due to tidal effects, as discussed above, are around a millionth of that at the Earth's surface. Accelerometers can only detect g-force i.e. weight2 (= mass × proper acceleration). They cannot detect the acceleration associated with free fall.Note: Accelerometers can detect a sudden change to free fall (as when a device is dropped), but they do this by measuring the change of acceleration from some value to zero. An accelerometer using a single weight or vibrating element and not measuring gradients across distances inside the accelerometer (which could be used to detect microgravity or tidal forces), cannot tell the difference between free fall in a gravity field, and weightlessness due to being far from masses and sources of gravitation. This is due to Einstein's strong equivalence principle. Sensation of weight The force on the feet is approximately double that on the cross-section through the navel.Humans experience their own body weight as a result of this supporting force, which results in a normal force applied to a person by the surface of a supporting object, on which the person is standing or sitting. In the absence of this force, a person would be in free-fall, and would experience weightlessness. It is the transmission of this reaction force through the human body, and the resultant compression and tension of the body's tissues, that results in the sensation of weight. Because of the distribution of mass throughout a person's body, the magnitude of the reaction force varies between a person's feet and head. At any horizontal cross-section of a person's body (as with any column), the size of the compressive force being resisted by the tissues below the cross-section is equal to the weight of the portion of the body above the cross-section. In the pose adopted in the accompanying illustration, the shoulders carry the weight of the outstretched arms and are subject to a considerable torque. A common misconception A common conception about spacecraft orbiting the earth is that they are operating in a gravity free environment. Although there is a way of making sense of this within the physics of Einstein's general relativity, within Newtonian physics, this is technically inaccurate . A geostationary satellite above a marked spot on the Equator. An observer on the marked spot will see the satellite remain directly overhead unlike the other heavenly objects which sweep across the sky. Spacecraft are held in orbit by the gravity of the planet which they are orbiting. In Newtonian physics, the sensation of weightlessness experienced by astronauts is not the result of there being zero gravitational acceleration (as seen from the Earth), but of there being no g-force that an astronaut can feel because of the free-fall condition, and also there being zero difference between the acceleration of the spacecraft and the acceleration of the astronaut. Space journalist James Oberg explains the phenomenon this way: A geostationary satellite is of special interest in this context. Unlike other objects in the sky which rise and set, an object in a geostationary orbit appears motionless in the sky, apparently defying gravity. In fact, it is in a circular equatorial orbit with a period of one day. =Relativity= To a modern physicist working with Einstein's general theory of relativity, the situation is even more complicated than is suggested above. Einstein's theory suggests that it actually is valid to consider that objects in inertial motion (such as falling in an elevator, or in a parabola in an airplane, or orbiting a planet) can indeed be considered to experience a local loss of the gravitational field in their rest frame. Thus, in the point of view (or frame) of the astronaut or orbiting ship, there actually is nearly-zero proper acceleration (the acceleration felt locally), just as would be the case far out in space, away from any mass. It is thus valid to consider that most of the gravitational field in such situations is actually absent from the point of view of the falling observer, just as the colloquial view suggests (see equivalence principle for a fuller explanation of this point). However, this loss of gravity for the falling or orbiting observer, in Einstein's theory, is due to the falling motion itself, and (again as in Newton's theory) not due to increased distance from the Earth. However, the gravity nevertheless is considered to be absent. In fact, Einstein's realization that a pure gravitational interaction cannot be felt, if all other forces are removed, was the key insight to leading him to the view that the gravitational \\"force\\" can in some ways be viewed as non-existent. Rather, objects tend to follow geodesic paths in curved space-time, and this is \\"explained\\" as a force, by \\"Newtonian\\" observers who assume that space-time is \\"flat,\\" and thus do not have a reason for curved paths (i.e., the \\"falling motion\\" of an object near a gravitational source). In the theory of general relativity, the only gravity which remains for the observer following a falling path or \\"inertial\\" path near a gravitating body, is that which is due to non-uniformities which remain in the gravitational field, even for the falling observer. This non- uniformity, which is a simple tidal effect in Newtonian dynamics, constitutes the \\"microgravity\\" which is felt by all spacially-extended objects falling in any natural gravitational field that originates from a compact mass. The reason for these tidal effects is that such a field will have its origin in a centralized place (the compact mass), and thus will diverge, and vary slightly in strength, according to distance from the mass. It will thus vary across the width of the falling or orbiting object. Thus, the term \\"microgravity,\\" an overly technical term from the Newtonian view, is a valid and descriptive term in the general relativistic (Einsteinian) view. =Microgravity= The term micro-g environment (also µg, often referred to by the term microgravity) is more or less a synonym of weightlessness and zero-G, but indicates that g-forces are not quite zero, just very small. Weightless and reduced weight environments Zero gravity flight maneuver =Reduced weight in aircraft= Airplanes have been used since 1959 to provide a nearly weightless environment in which to train astronauts, conduct research, and film motion pictures. Such aircraft are commonly referred by the nickname \\"Vomit Comet\\". To create a weightless environment, the airplane flies in a six-mile long parabolic arc, first climbing, then entering a powered dive. During the arc, the propulsion and steering of the aircraft are controlled such that the drag (air resistance) on the plane is cancelled out, leaving the plane to behave as it would if it were free-falling in a vacuum. During this period, the plane's occupants experience 22 seconds of weightlessness, before experiencing about 22 seconds of 1.8 g acceleration (nearly twice their normal weight) during the pull-out from the parabola. A typical flight lasts around two hours, during which 30 parabolae are flown. NASA's KC-135A plane ascending for a zero gravity maneuver NASA's Reduced Gravity Aircraft Versions of such airplanes have been operated by NASA's Reduced Gravity Research Program since 1973, where the unofficial nickname originated.Reduced Gravity Research Program NASA later adopted the official nickname 'Weightless Wonder' for publication. NASA's current Reduced Gravity Aircraft, \\"Weightless Wonder VI\\", a McDonnell Douglas C-9, is based at Ellington Field (KEFD), near Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center. NASA's Microgravity University - Reduced Gravity Flight Opportunities Plan, also known as the Reduced Gravity Student Flight Opportunities Program, allows teams of undergraduates to submit a microgravity experiment proposal. If selected, the teams design and implement their experiment, and students are invited to fly on NASA's Vomit Comet. European Space Agency A310 Zero-G The European Space Agency flies parabolic flights on a specially-modified Airbus A310-300 aircraft, in order to perform research in microgravity. As well European ESA, French CNES and German DLR fly campaigns of three flights on consecutive days, each flying about 30 parabolas, for a total of about 10 minutes of weightlessness per flight. These campaigns are currently operated from Bordeaux - Mérignac Airport in France by the company Novespace, a subsidiary of French CNES, while the aircraft is flown by test pilots from DGA Essais en Vol. The first ESA Zero-G flights were in 1984, using a NASA KC-135 aircraft in Houston, Texas. , the ESA has flown 52 campaigns and also 9 student parabolic flight campaigns. Other aircraft it has used include the Russian Ilyushin Il-76 MDK before founding Novespace, and using then a French Caravelle, then an Airbus A300 Zero-G and now an Airbus A310 Commercial flights for public passengers Inside Zero Gravity Corporation's airplane Novespace created Air Zero G in 2012 to share the experience of weightlessness to 40 public passengers per flight, using the same A310 ZERO-G than for scientific experiences. These flights are sold by Avico, are mainly operated from Bordeaux-Merignac, France, and intend to promote European space research, allowing public passengers to feel weightlessness. Jean-François Clervoy, Chairman of Novespace and ESA astronaut, flies with Air Zero G one-day- astronauts on board A310 Zero-G. After the flight, he explains the quest of space and talks about the 3 space travels he did along his career. The aircraft has also been used for cinema purposes, with Tom Cruise and Annabelle Wallis for the Mummy in 2017. The Zero Gravity Corporation, founded in 1993 by Peter Diamandis, Byron Lichtenberg, and Ray Cronise, operates a modified Boeing 727 which flies parabolic arcs to create 25–30 seconds of weightlessness. Flights may be purchased for both tourism and research purposes. =Ground-based drop facilities= Zero-gravity testing at the NASA Zero Gravity Research Facility Ground-based facilities that produce weightless conditions for research purposes are typically referred to as drop tubes or drop towers. NASA's Zero Gravity Research Facility, located at the Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio, is a 145-meter vertical shaft, largely below the ground, with an integral vacuum drop chamber, in which an experiment vehicle can have a free fall for a duration of 5.18 seconds, falling a distance of 132 meters. The experiment vehicle is stopped in approximately 4.5 meters of pellets of expanded polystyrene and experiences a peak deceleration rate of . Also at NASA Glenn is the 2.2 Second Drop Tower, which has a drop distance of 24.1 meters. Experiments are dropped in a drag shield, in order to reduce the effects of air drag. The entire package is stopped in a 3.3 meter tall air bag, at a peak deceleration rate of approximately . While the Zero Gravity Facility conducts one or two drops per day, the 2.2 Second Drop Tower can conduct up to twelve drops per day. NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center hosts another drop tube facility that is 105 meters tall and provides a 4.6 second free fall under near-vacuum conditions. Humans cannot utilize these gravity shafts, as the deceleration experienced by the drop chamber would likely kill or seriously injure anyone using them; is about the highest deceleration that a fit and healthy human can withstand momentarily without sustaining injury. Other drop facilities worldwide include: * Micro-Gravity Laboratory of Japan (MGLAB) – 4.5 s free fall * Experimental drop tube of the metallurgy department of Grenoble – 3.1 s free fall * Fallturm Bremen University of Bremen in Bremen – 4.74 s free fall * Queensland University of Technology Drop Tower - 2.0 s free fall =Neutral buoyancy= Conditions similar to some in weightlessness can also be simulated by creating the condition of neutral buoyancy, in which human subjects and equipment are placed in a water environment and weighted or buoyed until they hover in place. NASA uses neutral buoyancy to prepare for extra-vehicular activity (EVA) at its Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory. Neutral buoyancy is also used for EVA research at the University of Maryland's Space Systems Laboratory, which operates the only neutral buoyancy tank at a college or university. Neutral buoyancy is not identical to weightlessness. Gravity still acts on all objects in a neutral buoyancy tank; thus, astronauts in neutral buoyancy training still feel their full body weight within their spacesuits, although the weight is well-distributed, similar to force on a human body in a water bed, or when simply floating in water. The suit and astronaut together are under no net force, as for any object that is floating, or supported in water, such as a scuba diver at neutral buoyancy. Water also produces drag, which is not present in vacuum. =Weightlessness in a spacecraft= The relationship between acceleration and velocity vectors in an orbiting spacecraft US astronaut Marsha Ivins demonstrates the effect of weightlessness on long hair during STS-98 Long periods of weightlessness occur on spacecraft outside a planet's atmosphere, provided no propulsion is applied and the vehicle is not rotating. Weightlessness does not occur when a spacecraft is firing its engines or when re-entering the atmosphere, even if the resultant acceleration is constant. The thrust provided by the engines acts at the surface of the rocket nozzle rather than acting uniformly on the spacecraft, and is transmitted through the structure of the spacecraft via compressive and tensile forces to the objects or people inside. Weightlessness in an orbiting spacecraft is physically identical to free-fall, with the difference that gravitational acceleration causes a net change in the direction, rather than the magnitude, of the spacecraft's velocity. This is because the acceleration vector is perpendicular to the velocity vector. In typical free-fall, the acceleration of gravity acts along the direction of an object's velocity, linearly increasing its speed as it falls toward the Earth, or slowing it down if it is moving away from the Earth. In the case of an orbiting spacecraft, which has a velocity vector largely perpendicular to the force of gravity, gravitational acceleration does not produce a net change in the object's speed, but instead acts centripetally, to constantly \\"turn\\" the spacecraft's velocity as it moves around the Earth. Because the acceleration vector turns along with the velocity vector, they remain perpendicular to each other. Without this change in the direction of its velocity vector, the spacecraft would move in a straight line, leaving the Earth altogether. =Weightlessness at the center of a planet= The net gravitational force due to a spherically symmetrical planet is zero at the center. This is clear because of symmetry, and also from Newton's shell theorem which states that the net gravitational force due to a spherically symmetric shell, e.g., a hollow ball, is zero anywhere inside the hollow space. Thus the material at the center is weightless. Human health effects Astronaut Clayton Anderson as a large drop of water floats in front of him on the Discovery. Cohesion plays a bigger role in space. Following the advent of space stations that can be inhabited for long periods, exposure to weightlessness has been demonstrated to have some deleterious effects on human health. Humans are well-adapted to the physical conditions at the surface of the Earth. In response to an extended period of weightlessness, various physiological systems begin to change and atrophy. Though these changes are usually temporary, long term health issues can result. The most common problem experienced by humans in the initial hours of weightlessness is known as space adaptation syndrome or SAS, commonly referred to as space sickness. Symptoms of SAS include nausea and vomiting, vertigo, headaches, lethargy, and overall malaise. The first case of SAS was reported by cosmonaut Gherman Titov in 1961. Since then, roughly 45% of all people who have flown in space have suffered from this condition. The duration of space sickness varies, but in no case has it lasted for more than 72 hours, after which the body adjusts to the new environment. NASA jokingly measures SAS using the \\"Garn scale\\", named for United States Senator Jake Garn, whose SAS during STS-51-D was the worst on record. Accordingly, one \\"Garn\\" is equivalent to the most severe possible case of SAS., pg 35, Johnson Space Center Oral History Project, interview with Dr. Robert Stevenson: > \\"Jake Garn was sick, was pretty sick. I don't know whether we should tell > stories like that. But anyway, Jake Garn, he has made a mark in the > Astronaut Corps because he represents the maximum level of space sickness > that anyone can ever attain, and so the mark of being totally sick and > totally incompetent is one Garn. Most guys will get maybe to a tenth Garn, > if that high. And within the Astronaut Corps, he forever will be remembered > by that.\\" The most significant adverse effects of long-term weightlessness are muscle atrophy (see Reduced muscle mass, strength and performance in space for more information) and deterioration of the skeleton, or spaceflight osteopenia. These effects can be minimized through a regimen of exercise, such as cycling for example. Astronauts subject to long periods of weightlessness wear pants with elastic bands attached between waistband and cuffs to compress the leg bones and reduce osteopenia.\\"Health Fitness \\", Space Future Other significant effects include fluid redistribution (causing the \\"moon-face\\" appearance typical of pictures of astronauts in weightlessness),\\"The Pleasure of Spaceflight \\", Toyohiro Akiyama, Journal of Space Technology and Science, Vol.9 No.1 spring 1993, pp.21-23 a slowing of the cardiovascular system as blood flow decreases in response to a lack of gravity, a decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, and a weakening of the immune system. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, excess flatulence, and puffiness of the face. These effects begin to reverse quickly upon return to the Earth. In addition, after long space flight missions, astronauts may experience severe eyesight problems. Such eyesight problems may be a major concern for future deep space flight missions, including a crewed mission to the planet Mars. Exposure to high levels of radiation may influence the development of atherosclerosis also. On December 31, 2012, a NASA-supported study reported that human spaceflight may harm the brains of astronauts and accelerate the onset of Alzheimer's disease. In October 2015, the NASA Office of Inspector General issued a health hazards report related to human spaceflight, including a human mission to Mars. =Effects on non-human organisms= Russian scientists have observed differences between cockroaches conceived in space and their terrestrial counterparts. The space-conceived cockroaches grew more quickly, and also grew up to be faster and tougher. Chicken eggs that are put in microgravity two days after fertilization appear not to develop properly, whereas eggs put in microgravity more than a week after fertilization develop normally. A 2006 Space Shuttle experiment found that Salmonella typhimurium, a bacterium that can cause food poisoning, became more virulent when cultivated in space. On April 29, 2013, scientists in Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, funded by NASA, reported that, during spaceflight on the International Space Station, microbes seem to adapt to the space environment in ways \\"not observed on Earth\\" and in ways that \\"can lead to increases in growth and virulence\\". Under certain test conditions, microbes have been observed to thrive in the near- weightlessness of space and to survive in the vacuum of outer space. Technical adaptation in zero gravity Candle flame in orbital conditions (right) versus on Earth (left) Weightlessness can cause serious problems on technical instruments, especially those consisting of many mobile parts. Physical processes that depend on the weight of a body (like convection, cooking water or burning candles) act differently in free-fall. Cohesion and advection play a bigger role in space. Everyday work like washing or going to the bathroom are not possible without adaptation. To use toilets in space, like the one on the International Space Station, astronauts have to fasten themselves to the seat. A fan creates suction so that the waste is pushed away. Drinking is aided with a straw or from tubes.

The Guayas forms to the north of Guayaquil, where the Daule and the Babahoyo Rivers converge. The Babahayo arises from its tributaries in the Andes. The Guayas basin covers 40,000 square kilometers. The most important rivers in the Oriente are the Pastaza, Napo, and Putumayo. The Pastaza includes the Agoyan Waterfall, Ecuador's highest. Economy Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the indigenous people of Ecuador used the rivers for fishing and transportation, although frequent waterfalls limited canoe travel in the Andes. The rivers long continued to be an important means of transportation, especially as the mountains made road and railroad building difficult. Since the 20th century, rivers have become an important source of electric power in Ecuador. As of 2006, hydroelectric dams have a capacity 1,750 megawatts.Terry Some critics have noted that these projects have tended to be \\"substantially oversized\\" without \\"delivering the promised energy benefits.\\" In 2008, President Rafael Correa announced that the government planned to build eleven new hydroelectric power plants.Xinhua Almost all of the dam projects face opposition from local communities that fear negative environmental impacts on the land and a lack of transparency in decision-making. Recreational rafting on the rivers has become an important part of Ecuador's tourism-based economy.

He was a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984 and 1988 and served as a shadow U.S. Senator for the District of Columbia from 1991 to 1997. He is the founder of the organizations that merged to form Rainbow/PUSH. Former U.S. Representative Jesse Jackson Jr. is his eldest son. Jackson hosted Both Sides with Jesse Jackson on CNN from 1992 to 2000. Early life and education Jackson was born in Greenville, South Carolina, to Helen Burns (1924–2015), a 16-year-old high school student, and her 33-year-old married neighbor, Noah Louis Robinson (1908–1997). The family has some Cherokee roots.Blue Clark, Indian Tribes of Oklahoma: A Guide, University of Oklahoma Press (2012), p. 75 Robinson was a former professional boxer who was an employee of a textile brokerage and a well-known figure in the black community. One year after Jesse's birth, his mother married Charles Henry Jackson, a post office maintenance worker who later adopted the boy. Jesse was given his stepfather's name in the adoption, but as he grew up, he also maintained a close relationship with Robinson. He considered both men to be his fathers. As a young child, Jackson was taunted by other children about his out-of-wedlock birth, and has said these experiences helped motivate him to succeed. Living under Jim Crow segregation laws, Jackson was taught to go to the back of the bus and use separate water fountains—practices he accepted until the Montgomery bus boycott of 1955. He attended the racially segregated Sterling High School in Greenville, where he was elected student class president, finished tenth in his class, and earned letters in baseball, football and basketball. Upon graduating from high school in 1959, he rejected a contract from a minor league professional baseball team so that he could attend the University of Illinois on a football scholarship. After his second semester at that predominantly white school, Jackson transferred to North Carolina A&T;, a historically black university in Greensboro, North Carolina. Accounts of the reasons for this transfer differ. Jackson has said that he changed schools because racial prejudice prevented him from playing quarterback and limited his participation on a competitive public-speaking team. Writing on ESPN.com in 2002, sociologist Harry Edwards noted that the University of Illinois had previously had a black quarterback, but also noted that black athletes attending traditionally white colleges during the 1950s and 1960s encountered a \\"combination of culture shock and discrimination\\". Edwards also suggested that Jackson had left the University of Illinois in 1960 because he had been placed on academic probation, but the school's president reported in 1987 that Jackson's 1960 freshman year transcript was clean, and said he would have been eligible to re-enroll at any time. At A&T;, Jackson played quarterback and was elected student body president. He became active in local civil rights protests against segregated libraries, theaters and restaurants. He graduated with a B.S. in sociology in 1964, then attended the Chicago Theological Seminary on a scholarship. He dropped out in 1966, three classes short of earning his master's degree, to focus full-time on the civil rights movement. He was ordained a minister in 1968, and in 2000 was awarded a Master of Divinity Degree based on his previous credits earned plus his life experience and subsequent work. Civil rights activism=The Greenville Eight= On July 16, 1960, while home from college, Jackson joined seven other African Americans in a sit-in at the Greenville Public Library in Greenville, South Carolina, which only allowed white people. The group was arrested for \\"disorderly conduct\\". Jackson's pastor paid their bond, the Greenville News said. DeeDee Wright, another member of the group, later said they wanted to be arrested \\"so it could be a test case.” The Greenville City Council closed both the main library and the branch black people used. The possibility of a lawsuit led to the reopening of both libraries September 19, also the day after the News printed a letter written by Wright. =SCLC and Operation Breadbasket= Jackson has been known for commanding public attention since he first started working for Martin Luther King Jr. In 1965 he participated in the Selma to Montgomery marches organized by James Bevel, King and other civil rights leaders in Alabama. Impressed by Jackson's drive and organizational abilities, King soon began giving Jackson a role in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), though he was concerned about Jackson's apparent ambition and attention-seeking. When Jackson returned from Selma, he was charged with establishing a frontline office for the SCLC in Chicago. In 1966 King and Bevel selected Jackson to head the Chicago branch of the SCLC's economic arm, Operation Breadbasket and he was promoted to national director in 1967. Operation Breadbasket had been started by the Atlanta leadership of the SCLC as a job placement agency for blacks. Under Jackson's leadership, a key goal was to encourage massive boycotts by black consumers as a means to pressure white-owned businesses to hire blacks and to purchase goods and services from black-owned firms. T. R. M. Howard, a 1950s proponent of the consumer boycott tactic, soon became a major supporter of Jackson's efforts – donating and raising funds, and introducing Jackson to prominent members of the black business community in Chicago. Under Jackson's direction, Operation Breadbasket held popular weekly workshops on Chicago's South Side featuring white and black political and economic leaders, and religious services complete with a jazz band and choir. Jackson became involved in SCLC leadership disputes following King's assassination on April 4, 1968. When King was shot, Jackson was in the parking lot one floor below. Jackson told reporters he was the last person to speak to King, and that King died in his arms – an account that several King aides disputed. In the wake of King's death, Jackson worked on SCLC's Poor People's Crusade in Washington, D.C., and was credited with managing its 15-acre tent city – but he began to increasingly clash with Ralph Abernathy, King's successor as chairman of the SCLC. In 1969 The New York Times reported that several black leaders viewed Jackson as King's successor and that Jackson was one of the few black activists who was preaching racial reconciliation. Jackson was also reportedly seeking coalition with whites in order to approach what were considered racial problems as economic and class problems. \\"When we change the race problem into a class fight between the haves and the have-nots, then we are going to have a new ball game\\", he said. In the 21st century, some public school systems are working on an approach for affirmative action that deals with family income rather than race, recognizing that some minority members have been very successful. The Times also indicated that Jackson was being criticized as too involved with middle-class blacks, and for having an unattainable goal of racial unity. In the spring of 1971 Abernathy ordered Jackson to move the national office of Operation Breadbasket from Chicago to Atlanta and sought to place another person in charge of local Chicago activities, but Jackson refused to move. He organized the October 1971 Black Expo in Chicago, a trade and business fair to promote black capitalism and grass roots political power. The five-day event was attended by black businessmen from 40 states, as well as politicians such as Cleveland Mayor Carl Stokes, and Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley. Daley's presence was seen as a testament to the growing political and economic power of blacks. In December 1971 Jackson and Abernathy had a complete falling out, with the split described as part of a leadership struggle between Jackson, who had a national profile, and Abernathy, whose prominence from the Civil Rights Movement was beginning to wane. The break began when Abernathy questioned the handling of receipts from the Black Expo, and then suspended Jackson as leader of Operation Breadbasket for not obtaining permission to form non-profit corporations. Al Sharpton, then youth group leader of the SCLC, left the organization to protest Jackson's treatment and formed the National Youth Movement. Jackson, his entire Breadbasket staff, and 30 of the 35 board members resigned from the SCLC and began planning a new organization. Time magazine quoted Jackson as saying at that time that the traditional civil rights movement had lost its \\"offensive thrust.\\" =Operation PUSH and the Rainbow Coalition= The Rainbow/PUSH national headquarters in Kenwood, Chicago People United to Save Humanity (Operation PUSH) officially began operations on December 25, 1971; Jackson later changed the name to People United to Serve Humanity. T. R. M. Howard was installed as a member of the board of directors and chair of the finance committee. At its inception, Jackson planned to orient Operation PUSH toward politics and to pressure politicians to work to improve economic opportunities for blacks and poor people of all races. SCLC officials reportedly felt the new organization would help black businesses more than it would help the poor. In 1978 Jackson called for a closer relationship between blacks and the Republican Party, telling the Party's National Committee that \\"Black people need the Republican Party to compete for us so we can have real alternatives ... The Republican Party needs black people if it is ever to compete for national office.\\" In 1983 Jackson and Operation PUSH led a boycott against beer giant Anheuser- Busch, criticizing the company's level of minority employment in their distribution network. August Busch IV, Anheuser-Busch's CEO was introduced in 1996 to Yusef Jackson, Jesse's son, by Jackson family friend Ron Burkle. In 1998 Yusef and his brother Jonathan were chosen by Anheuser-Busch to head River North Sales, a Chicago beer distribution company, leading to controversy. \\"There is no causal connection between the boycott in 1983 and me meeting in the middle '90s and me buying this company in 1998,\\" said Yusef. In 1984 Jackson organized the Rainbow Coalition and resigned his post as president of Operation PUSH in 1984 to run for president of the United States, though he remained involved as chairman of the board. PUSH's activities were described in 1987 as conducting boycotts of business to induce them to provide more jobs and business to blacks and as running programs for housing, social services and voter registration. The organization was funded by contributions from businesses and individuals. In early 1987 the continued existence of Operation PUSH was imperiled by debt, a fact that Jackson's political opponents used during his race for the 1988 Democratic Party nomination. In 1996 the Operation PUSH and Rainbow Coalition organizations were merged. International activism Jackson's influence extended to international matters in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1983 he traveled to Syria to secure the release of a captured American pilot, Navy Lt. Robert Goodman, who was being held by the Syrian government. Goodman had been shot down over Lebanon while on a mission to bomb Syrian positions in that country. After Jackson made a dramatic personal appeal to Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, Goodman was released. The Reagan administration was initially skeptical about Jackson's trip, but after Jackson secured Goodman's release, Reagan welcomed Jackson and Goodman to the White House on January 4, 1984. This helped to boost Jackson's popularity as an American patriot and served as a springboard for his 1984 presidential run. In June 1984 Jackson negotiated the release of 22 Americans being held in Cuba after an invitation by Cuban president Fidel Castro. On the eve of the 1991 Persian Gulf War, Jackson made a trip to Iraq to plead with Saddam Hussein for the release of foreign nationals held there as a \\"human shield\\", securing the release of several British and 20 American individuals. In 1997 Jackson traveled to Kenya to meet with Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi as United States President Bill Clinton's special envoy for democracy to promote free and fair elections. In April 1999, during the Kosovo War, he traveled to Belgrade to negotiate the release of three U.S. POWs captured on the Macedonian border while patrolling with a UN peacekeeping unit. He met with then-Yugoslav president Slobodan Milošević, who later agreed to release the three men. His international efforts continued into the 2000s. On February 15, 2003, Jackson spoke in front of over an estimated one million people in Hyde Park, London at the culmination of the anti-war demonstration against the imminent invasion of Iraq by the U.S. and the United Kingdom. In November 2004 Jackson visited senior politicians and community activists in Northern Ireland in an effort to encourage better cross-community relations and rebuild the peace process and restore the governmental institutions of the Belfast Agreement. In August 2005 Jackson traveled to Venezuela to meet Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, following controversial remarks by televangelist Pat Robertson that implied that Chávez should be assassinated. Jackson condemned Robertson's remarks as immoral. After meeting with Chávez and addressing the Venezuelan Parliament, Jackson said there was no evidence that Venezuela posed a threat to the U.S. He also met representatives from the Venezuelan African and indigenous communities. In 2005 Jackson was enlisted as part of the United Kingdom's \\"Operation Black Vote\\", a campaign Simon Woolley ran to encourage more of Britain's ethnic minorities to vote in political elections ahead of the May 2005 General Election. In 2009 Jackson served as a speaker for The International Peace Foundation on the topic \\"Building a culture of peace and development in a globalized world\\". He visited multiple locations in Malaysia, including the Institute of Diplomacy and Foreign Relations of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and in Thailand, including NIST International School in Bangkok. Political activism During the 1980s Jackson achieved wide fame as a politician and a spokesman for civil rights issues. In 1980, for example, he mediated in a firefighters' strike. =1984 presidential campaign= Jackson in 1983 On November 3, 1983, Jackson announced his campaign for President of the United States in the 1984 election, becoming the second African American (after Shirley Chisholm) to mount a nationwide campaign for president as a Democrat. In the Democratic primaries, Jackson, who had been written off by pundits as a fringe candidate with little chance at winning the nomination, surprised many when he took third place behind Senator Gary Hart and former Vice President Walter Mondale, who eventually won the nomination. Jackson garnered 3,282,431 primary votes, or 18.2% of the total, in 1984, and won primaries and caucuses in Louisiana, the District of Columbia, South Carolina, and Mississippi. More Virginia caucus-goers supported Jackson than any other candidate, but Mondale won more Virginia delegates. In May 1988 Jackson complained that he had won 21% of the popular vote but was awarded only 9% of the delegates. He afterwards stated that he had been handicapped by party rules. While Mondale (in the words of his aides) was determined to establish a precedent with his vice presidential candidate by picking a woman or visible minority, Jackson criticized the screening process as a \\"p.r. parade of personalities\\". He also mocked Mondale, saying that Hubert Humphrey was the \\"last significant politician out of the St. Paul–Minneapolis\\" area. =Relations with Jewish community= Jackson was criticized in the early 1980s for referring to Jews as \\"Hymies\\" and New York City as \\"Hymietown\\" in remarks to a black Washington Post reporter. (\\"Hymie\\" is a pejorative term for Jews.) He had mistakenly assumed the references would not be printed. Louis Farrakhan made the situation worse by issuing, in Jackson's presence, a public warning to Jews that \\"If you harm this brother [Jackson], it will be the last one you harm.\\" During a speech before national Jewish leaders in a Manchester, New Hampshire synagogue, Jackson publicly apologized to Jews for the pejorative remarks, but did not denounce Farrakhan's warning. A rift between Jackson and many in the Jewish community endured at least through the 1990s. Shortly after President Jimmy Carter fired U.N. Ambassador Andrew Young for meeting with Palestine Liberation Organization representatives, Jackson and other black leaders began publicly endorsing a Palestinian state, with Jackson calling Israel's prime minister a \\"terrorist\\" and soliciting Arab-American financial support. Jackson has since apologized for some of these remarks, but they badly damaged his presidential campaign, as \\"Jackson was seen by many conservatives in the United States as hostile to Israel and far too close to Arab governments.\\" According to a 1987 New York Times article, Jackson began attempting to improve his relationship with the Jewish community after 1984. In 2000 he was invited to speak in support of Jewish Senator and Vice Presidential candidate Joe Lieberman at the Democratic National Convention. On March 8, 2020, Jackson endorsed Jewish candidate Bernie Sanders for president. =1988 presidential campaign= In 1988 Jackson again sought the Democratic presidential nomination. According to a November 1987 New York Times article, \\"Most political analysts give him little chance of being nominated – partly because he is black, partly because of his unretrenched liberalism.\\" But his past successes made him a more credible candidate, and he was both better financed and better organized than in 1984. Jackson once again exceeded expectations as he more than doubled his previous results, prompting R.W. Apple of The New York Times to call 1988 \\"the Year of Jackson\\". Jesse Jackson (right) with Curt Anderson (center) and Decatur \\"Bucky\\" Trotter (left) during a Maryland Legislative Black Caucus meeting in Annapolis, Maryland (1988) In early 1988 Jackson organized a rally at the former American Motors assembly plant in Kenosha, Wisconsin, approximately two weeks after new owner Chrysler announced it would close the plant by the end of the year. In his speech he spoke out against Chrysler's decision: \\"We have to put the focus on Kenosha, Wisconsin, as the place, here and now, where we draw the line to end economic violence!\\" He compared the workers' fight to that of the 1965 Voting Rights Movement in Selma, Alabama. As a result, the UAW Local 72 union voted to endorse Jackson, even against UAW rules. After winning 55% of the vote in the Michigan Democratic caucus, Jackson was considered the front-runner for the nomination, as he surpassed all the other candidates in total number of pledged delegates. But Jackson's campaign suffered a significant setback less than two weeks after the UAW endorsement when he narrowly lost the Colorado primary to Michael Dukakis and was defeated handily the following day by Dukakis in the Wisconsin primary. Jackson's showing among white voters in Wisconsin was significantly better than in 1984, but was also noticeably lower than pre-primary polling had predicted. The back-to-back victories established Dukakis as the front-runner. He went on to win the party's nomination, but lost the general election in November. Jackson's campaign was also interrupted by allegations regarding his half-brother Noah Robinson Jr.'s criminal activity. Jackson had to answer frequent questions about Noah, who was often called \\"the Billy Carter of the Jackson campaign\\". At the conclusion of the Democratic primary season, Jackson had captured 6.9 million votes and won 11 contests: Seven primaries (Alabama, the District of Columbia, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Puerto Rico and Virginia) and four caucuses (Delaware, Michigan, South Carolina and Vermont). Jackson also scored March victories in Alaska's caucuses and Texas's local conventions, despite losing the Texas primary. =Campaign platform= In both races Jackson ran on what many considered to be a very liberal platform. In 1987 The New York Times described him as \\"a classic liberal in the tradition of the New Deal and the Great Society\\". Declaring that he wanted to create a \\"Rainbow Coalition\\" of various minority groups, including African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Arab- Americans, Asian Americans, Native Americans, family farmers, the poor and working class, and homosexuals, as well as European American progressives who fit into none of those categories, Jackson ran on a platform that included: * Creating a Works Progress Administration-style program to rebuild America's infrastructure and provide jobs to all Americans, * Re-prioritizing the War on Drugs to focus less on mandatory minimum sentences for drug users (which he views as racially biased) and more on harsher punishments for money-laundering bankers and others who are part of the \\"supply\\" end of \\"supply and demand\\" * Reversing Reaganomics-inspired tax cuts for the richest ten percent of Americans and using the money to finance social welfare programs * Cutting the budget of the Department of Defense by as much as fifteen percent over the course of his administration * Declaring Apartheid-era South Africa to be a rogue nation * Instituting an immediate nuclear freeze and beginning disarmament negotiations with the Soviet Union * Supporting family farmers by reviving many of Roosevelt's New Deal–era farm programs * Creating a single- payer system of universal health care * Ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment * Increasing federal funding for lower-level public education and providing free community college to all * Applying stricter enforcement of the Voting Rights Act and * Supporting the formation of a Palestinian state. Jackson making a speech at the Goodwill Games in Seattle, 1990 With the exception of a resolution to implement sanctions against South Africa for its apartheid policies, none of these positions made it into the party's platform in either 1984 or 1988. =Stance on abortion= Although Jackson was one of the most liberal members of the Democratic Party, his position on abortion was originally more in line with pro-life views. Less than a month after the 1973 Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade legalized abortion, Jackson began a PUSH campaign against the decision, calling abortion murder and declaring that Jesus and Moses might not have been born if abortion had been available in ancient times. Jackson's strong rhetoric on abortion temporarily alienated one of his major supporters, T. R. M. Howard, a black physician who performed abortions. In 1975 Jackson endorsed a plan for a constitutional amendment banning abortion. He also endorsed the Hyde Amendment, which bars the funding of abortions through the federal Medicaid program. In a 1977 National Right to Life Committee News report Jackson argued that the basis for Roe v. Wade – the right to privacy – had also been used to justify slavery and the treatment of slaves on the plantations. Jackson decried what he believed was the casual taking of life and the decline in society's values. But Jackson later adopted the view that women have the right to an abortion and that the government should not interfere. =Later political activities=1990s Jackson with Maude Barlow Jackson ran for office as \\"shadow senator\\" for the District of Columbia when the position was created in 1991, and served as such through 1997, when he did not run for reelection. This unpaid position was primarily a post to lobby for statehood for the District of Columbia. In the mid-1990s Jackson was approached about being the United States Ambassador to South Africa but declined the opportunity in favor of helping his son Jesse Jackson Jr. run for the United States House of Representatives. Jackson was initially critical of Bill Clinton's moderate, \\"Third Way\\" policies. According to journalist Peter Beinart, Clinton was \\"petrified about a primary challenge from\\" Jackson in the 1996 election. But Jackson became a key ally in gaining African American support for Clinton and eventually became a close adviser and friend of the Clinton family. His son Jesse Jackson Jr. was elected to the United States House of Representatives from Illinois. On May 2, 1999, during the Kosovo war, three US soldiers who had been held captive were released as a result of talks with Jackson.SUSAN SACHS, CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: PRISONERS; Serbs Release 3 Captured U.S. Soldiers May 2, 1999 New York Times Jackson's negotiation was not sanctioned by the Clinton administration. On November 18, 1999, seven Decatur, Illinois high school students were expelled for two years after participating in a brawl at a football game. The incident was caught on home video and became a national media event when CNN ran pictures of the fight. After the students were expelled, Jackson argued that the expulsions were unfair and racially biased. He called on the school board to reverse its decision. 2000s On January 20, 2001, Bill Clinton's final day in office, Clinton pardoned Congressman Mel Reynolds, John Bustamante, and Dorothy Rivers, all of whose pardons Jackson had requested. Jackson had also requested a pardon for his half-brother Noah Robinson, who had been convicted of murdering Leroy Barber and sentenced to life imprisonment, but Clinton did not pardon Robinson on the grounds that Robinson had already submitted three pardon appeals, all of which the Justice Department had denied.Timmerman, Kenneth, \\"Shakedown, Exposing the Jesse Jackson Racket\\" Jackson was a target of the 2002 white supremacist terror plot. anti-war rally in 2007 with Sean Penn In early 2005 Jackson visited the parents in the Terri Schiavo case; he supported their unsuccessful bid to keep her alive. In 2005 the Federal Election Commission ruled that Jackson and the Democratic National Committee had violated electoral law and levied on them a $200,000 fine. In March 2006 an African-American woman accused three white members of the Duke University men's lacrosse team of raping her. During the ensuing controversy, Jackson stated that his Rainbow/PUSH Coalition would pay for the rest of her college tuition regardless of the outcome of the case. The case against the three men was later thrown out and the players were declared innocent by the North Carolina Attorney General. Jackson took a key role in the scandal caused by comedic actor Michael Richards's racially charged comments in November 2006. Richards called Jackson a few days after the incident to apologize; Jackson accepted Richards's apology and met with him publicly as a means of resolving the situation. Jackson also joined black leaders in a call for the elimination of the \\"N-word\\" throughout the entertainment industry. On June 23, 2007, Jackson was arrested in connection with a protest at a gun store in Riverdale, a poor suburb of Chicago, Illinois. Jackson and others were protesting due to allegations that the gun store had been selling firearms to local gang members and was contributing to the decay of the community. According to police reports, Jackson refused to stop blocking the front entrance of the store and let customers pass. He was charged with one count of criminal trespass to property. In March 2007 Jackson declared his support for then-Senator Barack Obama in the 2008 democratic primaries. He later criticized Obama in 2007 for \\"acting like he's white\\" in response to the Jena 6 beating case. On July 6, 2008, during an interview with Fox News, a microphone picked up Jackson whispering to fellow guest Reed Tuckson: \\"See, Barack's been, ahh, talking down to black people on this faith-based... I want to cut his nuts off.\\" Jackson was expressing his disappointment in Obama's Father's Day speech chastisement of black fathers. Subsequent to his Fox News interview, Jackson apologized and reiterated his support for Obama. On November 4, 2008, Jackson attended the Obama victory rally in Chicago's Grant Park. In the moments before Obama spoke, Jackson was seen in tears. 2010s Jackson with Charlie Strong and George W. Bush in April 2014 Jackson in 2012 Jackson at the Islamic Society of North America convention in Chicago in September 2016 In 2012, he commended Obama's 2012 decision to support gay marriage and compared the fight for same-sex marriage to the fight against slavery and the anti- miscegenation laws that once prevented interracial marriage. He favored federal legislation extending marriage rights to gays. In the 2016 United States presidential election he endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. In the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, he endorsed Bernie Sanders. Electoral historyAwards and recognition Ebony Magazine named Jackson to its \\"100 most influential black Americans\\" list in 1971. In 1979, Jackson received the Jefferson Award for Greatest Public Service Benefiting the Disadvantaged. In 1989, he was awarded the Spingarn Medal from the NAACP. In 1991, Jackson received the American Whig-Cliosophic Society's James Madison Award for Distinguished Public Service. In 1999 he received the Golden Doves for Peace journalistic prize issued by the Italian Research Institute Archive Disarmo.http://www.archiviodisarmo.it/images/pdf/list.pdf Clinton awarded Jackson the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest honor bestowed on civilians in August 2000. In 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante included Jackson on his list of 100 Greatest African Americans. In 2008, Jackson was presented with an Honorary Fellowship from Edge Hill University. In an AP-AOL \\"Black Voices\\" poll in February 2006, Jackson was voted \\"the most important black leader\\". Jackson inherited the title of the High Prince of the Agni people of Côte d'Ivoire from Michael Jackson. In August 2009, he was crowned Prince Côte Nana by Amon N'Douffou V, King of Krindjabo, who rules more than a million Agni tribespeople. Personal life Jackson at the 2012 Bud Billiken Parade Jackson married Jacqueline Lavinia Brown (born 1944) on December 31, 1962, and together they have five children: Santita (1963), Jesse Jr. (1965), Jonathan Luther (1966), Yusef DuBois (1970), and Jacqueline Lavinia (1975). Jackson's younger brother, Charles \\"Chuck\\" Jackson, was a singer with the vocal group The Independents and as a solo artist who issued two albums in the late 1970s. Along with his songwriting partner and fellow producer, Marvin Yancy, he was largely responsible for launching the career of Natalie Cole. On Memorial Day, May 25, 1987, Jesse was made a Master Mason on Sight by Grand Master Senter of the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Illinois; thereby making him a Prince Hall Freemason. In 2001, it was revealed Jackson had an affair with a staffer, Karin Stanford, that resulted in the birth of a daughter Ashley in May 1999. According to CNN, in August 1999, the Rainbow Push Coalition had paid Stanford $15,000 in moving expenses and $21,000 in payment for contracting work. A promised advance of an additional $40,000 against future contracting work was rescinded once the affair became public. This incident prompted Jackson to withdraw from activism for a short time. Jackson was paying $4,000 a month in child support as of 2001. In November 2017, Jackson was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.

It was established in 1901 by W. G. Collingwood, an artist and antiquarian who had worked as secretary to art critic John Ruskin. The museum is both a memorial to Ruskin and a local museum covering the history and heritage of Coniston Water and the Lake District. The museum is a registered charity in England & Wales, constituted as The Coniston Institute and Ruskin Museum.Charity No. 222234 - The Coniston Institute and Ruskin Museum Collections & exhibits Fragment of Bluebird K7 at the Ruskin Museum Its collections include material on the copper and slate mines of the region, geology, lace making, farming, and writer Arthur Ransome. A larger collection is devoted to the life and work of John Ruskin. A specialist collection covers the achievements of Donald Campbell, who died while attempting a new water speed record on Coniston Water. In December 2006, his daughter Gina Campbell donated the salvaged remains of Bluebird K7 to the Ruskin Museum on behalf of the whole Campbell family. There is now uncertainty about the future of the boat, partly due to the conflicting desires of both parties: The Bluebird Project wishes to be able to exhibit it on water periodically, as a working racing speedboat, and the museum, in contrast, wishes to keep it as a permanent exhibit as per the wishes of the 2006 deed of gift. The original recovered material is now the property of the museum while the restored and replaced parts of the boat remain under the control of The Bluebird Project who retain ownership ownership of their materials. In the grounds of the museum stands 'Riverdale', an extensive collection of over sixty miniature structures including houses, bridges and farm buildings which were hand-made by local builder John Usher (1940-1993). Based on local vernacular architecture, the slate and stone structures were removed from Usher's former home Brow Head after his death, with the largest collection being rehomed at the museum in 1999. Developments In the 1980s, the museum was at risk, and a project was launched to secure its long-term future. An £850,000 development scheme (funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, European Regional Development Fund, Foundation for Sport and the Arts, the Rural Development Commission and others) was started. The interpretive design for the Ruskin Museum received an Association for Heritage Interpretation Interpret Britain Award in 1999. The restored museum with its new extension re-opened to the public in May 1999Visit Cumbria: \\"Coniston - The Ruskin Museum\\" and was officially opened by the then Culture Secretary, the Rt. Honourable Chris Smith on 23 May 2000. In 2017/18, architect Takeshi Hayatsu worked with tutors and students from Central Saint Martins in London and Grizedale Arts to design and install a kiosk adjacent to the museum, with surface copper tiles decorated by local people. The kiosk provides information on the area's copper mining history. The museum grounds also include a community bread oven by Hayatsu and students, a project that was shortlisted for the Architects Journal Small Projects Awards 2018.

Front Cover United States. Foreign Broadcast Information Service. p. 38. Trained as a psychiatrist, he co-founded the Serb Democratic Party in Bosnia and Herzegovina and served as the first President of Republika Srpska from 1992 to 1996. He was a fugitive from 1996 until July 2008, after having been indicted for war crimes by the ICTY. The indictment concluded there were reasonable grounds for believing he committed war crimes, including genocide against Bosniak and Croat civilians during the Bosnian War (1992–1995). While a fugitive, he worked at a private clinic in Belgrade, specializing in alternative medicine and psychology, under an alias. He was arrested in Belgrade on 21 July 2008 and brought before Belgrade's War Crimes Court a few days later. Extradited to the Netherlands, he was placed in the custody of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the United Nations Detention Unit of Scheveningen, where he was charged with 11 counts of war crimes. He is sometimes referred to by the Western media as the \\"Butcher of Bosnia\\", a sobriquet also applied to former Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) General Ratko Mladić. On 24 March 2016, he was found guilty of the genocide in Srebrenica, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, 10 of the 11 charges in total, and sentenced to 40 years' imprisonment. On 22 July 2016, he filed an appeal against his conviction. The appeal was rejected on 20 March 2019, and the sentence was increased to life imprisonment. Early life and education Publicity photo of Karadžić in 1971 Radovan Karadžić was born to a Serb family on 19 June 1945 in the village of Petnjica in the People's Republic of Montenegro, Democratic Federal Yugoslavia, near Šavnik. Karadžić's father, Vuko (1912–1987), was a cobbler from Petnjica. His mother, Jovanka ( Jakić; 1922–2005), was a peasant girl from Pljevlja. She married Karadžić's father in 1943, aged twenty. Karadžić claims to be related to the Serbian linguistic reformer Vuk Stefanović Karadžić (1787–1864), although as of 2014 this claim had not been confirmed. His father had been a Chetnik – i.e. a member of the army of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia's government-in-exile during World War II – and was imprisoned by the post-war communist regime for much of his son's childhood. Karadžić moved to Sarajevo in 1960 to study psychiatry at the Sarajevo University School of Medicine.Robert J. Donia. (2014). Radovan Karadzic: Architect of the Bosnian Genocide, p. 27, Cambridge University Press. In spite of the fact that his father fought in a war, Karadžić himself held no military-orientated ambitions. It is widely believed that he never served his then-obligatory 1-year long military service within the Yugoslav People's Army, as such claim was given by Stjepan Kljujić, who was a Croat- member of the Bosnian rotating presidency.https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl;=hr&tl;=en&u;=https%3A%2F%2Fdnevnik.hr%2Fvijesti%2Fsvijet%2Fkaradzic- nije-sluzio-vojsku-i-piskio-je-u-krevet.html Karadžić studied neurotic disorders and depression at Næstved Hospital in Denmark in 1970, and during 1974 and 1975 he underwent further medical training at Columbia University in New York. After his return to Yugoslavia, he worked in the Koševo Hospital in Sarajevo. He was also a poet, influenced by Serbian writer Dobrica Ćosić, who encouraged him to go into politics. During his spell as an ecologist, he declared that \\"Bolshevism is bad, but nationalism is even worse\\". Financial misdeeds File picture taken upon Karadžić's arrest in November 1984 Soon after graduation, Karadžić started working in a treatment centre at the psychiatric clinic of the main Sarajevo hospital, Koševo. According to testimony, he often boosted his income by issuing false medical and psychological evaluations to healthcare workers who wanted early retirement or to criminals who tried to avoid punishment by pleading insanity. In 1983, Karadžić started working at a hospital in the Belgrade suburb of Voždovac. With his partner Momčilo Krajišnik, then manager of a mining enterprise Energoinvest, he managed to gain a loan from an agricultural-development fund, and they used it to build themselves houses in Pale, a Serb town above Sarajevo turned into a ski resort by the government. On 1 November 1984, the two men were arrested for fraud and spent 11 months in detention before their friend Nikola Koljević managed to bail them out. Due to a lack of evidence, Karadžić was released and his trial was brought to a halt. The trial was revived, however, and on 26 September 1985 Karadžić was sentenced to three years in prison for embezzlement and fraud. As he had already spent over a year in detention, Karadžić did not serve the remaining sentence in prison. Political life Following encouragement from Dobrica Ćosić, later the first president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and Jovan Rašković, leader of the Croatian Serbs, Karadžić cofounded the Serb Democratic Party () in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1989. The party aimed at unifying the Republic's Bosnian Serb community and joining Croatian Serbs in leading them in remaining as part of Yugoslavia in the event of secession by those two republics from the federation. Throughout September 1991, the SDS began to establish various \\"Serb Autonomous Regions\\" throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina. After the Bosnian parliament voted on sovereignty on 15 October 1991, a separate Serb Assembly was founded on 24 October 1991 in Banja Luka, to exclusively represent the Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The following month, Bosnian Serbs held a referendum which resulted in an overwhelming vote in favour of staying in a federal state with Serbia and Montenegro, as part of Yugoslavia. In December 1991, a top secret document, For the organisation and activity of organs of the Serbs people in Bosnia-Herzegovina in extraordinary circumstances, was drawn up by the SDS leadership. This was a centralised programme for the takeover of each municipality in the country, through the creation of shadow governments and para-governmental structures through various \\"crisis headquarters\\", and by preparing loyalist Serbs for the takeover in co- ordination with the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA). On 9 January 1992, the Bosnian Serb Assembly proclaimed the Republic of the Serb People of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Република српског народа Босне и Херцеговине/Republika srpskog naroda Bosne i Hercegovine). On 28 February 1992, the constitution of the Serb Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was adopted. It declared that the state's territory included Serb autonomous regions, municipalities, and other Serbian ethnic entities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as \\"all regions in which the Serbian people represent a minority due to the Second World War genocide\\" (although how this was established was never specified), and that it was to be a part of the federal Yugoslav state. On 29 February and 1 March 1992 a referendum on the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina from Yugoslavia was held. Many Serbs boycotted the referendum and pro-independence Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims) and Croats turned out.Nettelfield, Lara J. (2010). Courting Democracy in Bosnia and Herzegovina (p. 67). Cambridge University Press. . =President of Republika Srpska= Radovan Karadžić during a visit in Moscow, 3 March 1994 On 6 and 7 April 1992, Bosnia and Herzegovina was recognized as an independent state by the European Community and the US. It was admitted to the UN on 22 May 1992. Karadžić was voted President of Republika Srpska, the Bosnian Serb administration, in Pale on about 13 May 1992 after the breakup of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. At the time he assumed this position, his de jure powers, as described in the constitution of the Bosnian Serb administration, included commanding the army of the Bosnian Serb administration in times of war and peace, and having the authority to appoint, promote and discharge officers of the army. Karadžić made three trips to the UN in New York in February and March 1993 for negotiations on the future of Bosnia. He went to Moscow in 1994 for meetings with Russian officials on the Bosnian situation. In 1994, the Greek Orthodox Church declared Karadžić \\"one of the most prominent sons of our Lord Jesus Christ working for peace\\", and decorated him with the nine-hundred-year-old Knights' Order of the First Rank of Saint Dionysius of Xanthe. Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew announced that \\"the Serbian people have been chosen by God to protect the western frontiers of Orthodoxy\\". On Friday 4 August 1995, with a massive Croatian military force poised to attack the Serb-held Krajina region in central Croatia, Karadžić announced he was removing General Ratko Mladić from his commandant post and assuming personal command of the VRS himself. Karadžić blamed Mladić for the loss of two key Serb-held towns in western Bosnia that had recently fallen to the Croats, and he used the loss of the towns as the excuse to announce his surprise command structure changes. General Mladić was demoted to an \\"adviser\\". Mladić refused to go quietly, claiming the support of the Bosnian Serb military and the people. Karadžić countered by attempting to pull political rank as well as denouncing Mladić as a \\"madman\\", but Mladić's popular support forced Karadžić to rescind his order on 11 August.The Hague's Most Wanted – timeline of events. SETimes.com (21 July 2008). Retrieved 13 November 2010. =War crimes charges= Karadžić was accused by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) of personal and command responsibility for numerous war crimes committed against non- Serbs, in his roles as Supreme Commander of the Bosnian Serb armed forces and President of the National Security Council of the Republika Srpska. He was accused by the same authority of being responsible for the deaths of more than 7,500 Bosniaks (Muslims). Under his direction and command, Bosnian Serb forces initiated the Siege of Sarajevo. He was accused by the ICTY of ordering the Srebrenica genocide in 1995, directing Bosnian Serb forces to \\"create an unbearable situation of total insecurity with no hope of further survival of life\\" in the UN safe area. He was also accused by the ICTY of ordering that United Nations personnel be taken hostage in May-June 1995.Prosecutor v. Radovan Karadžić, Decision of 11 December 2012, ICTY He was jointly indicted by the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in 1995, along with General Ratko Mladić. The indictment charged Karadžić on the basis of his individual criminal responsibility (Article 7(1) of the Statute) and superior criminal responsibility (Article 7(3) of the Statute) with: * Five counts of crimes against humanity (Article 5 of the Statute – extermination, murder, persecutions on political, racial and religious grounds, persecutions, inhumane acts (forcible transfer)); * Three counts of violations of the laws of war (Article 3 of the Statute – murder, unlawfully inflicting terror upon civilians, taking hostages); * One count of grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions (Article 2 of the Statute – willful killing). * Unlawful transfer of civilians because of religious or national identity. The United States government offered a $5 million reward for his and Ratko Mladić's arrests. Fugitive Authorities missed arresting Karadžić in 1995 when he was an invitee of the United Nations. During his visit to the United Nations in 1993, he was handed a service of process for a civil claim under the United States of America's Alien Tort Act. The Courts ruled that Karadžić was properly served and the trial was allowed to proceed in United States District Court.Kadić v. Karadžić, 70 F.3d 232 (2d Cir. 1995) Karadžić's ability to evade capture for over a decade increased his esteem among some Bosnian Serbs, despite an alleged deal with Richard Holbrooke. Some sources allege that he received protection from the United States as a consequence of the Dayton Agreement. Holbrooke, however, repeatedly denied that such a deal was ever made. During his time as fugitive he was helped by several people, including Bosko Radonjich and in 2001, hundreds of supporters demonstrated in support of Karadžić in his home town. In March 2003, his mother Jovanka publicly urged him to surrender. British officials conceded military action was unlikely to be successful in bringing Karadžić and other suspects to trial, and that putting political pressure on Balkan governments would be more likely to succeed. In May 2004, the UN learned that: \\"the brother of a war crimes suspect allegedly in the process of providing information on Radovan Karadžić and his network to the ICTY, was mistakenly killed in a raid by the Republika Srpska police\\" and added that \\"It is being argued that the informer was targeted in order to silence him before he was able to say more.\\" In 2005, Bosnian Serb leaders called on Karadžić to surrender, stating that Bosnia and Serbia could not move ahead economically or politically while he remained at large. After a failed raid earlier in May, on 7 July 2005 NATO troops arrested Karadžić's son, Aleksandar, but released him after 10 days. On 28 July, Karadžić's wife, Ljiljana, made a call for him to surrender after what she called \\"enormous pressure\\". See also: The BBC reported that Karadžić had been sighted in 2005 near Foča: \\"38 km (24 miles) down the road, on the edge of the Sutjeska national park, Radovan Karadžić has just got out of a red Mercedes\\" and asserted that \\"Western intelligence agencies knew roughly where they were, but that there was no political will in London or Washington to risk the lives of British, or U.S. agents, in a bid to seize\\" him and Mladić. On 10 January 2008, the BBC reported that the passports of his closest relatives had been seized. On 21 February 2008, at the time Kosovo declared independence, portraits of Karadžić were on display during Belgrade's \\"Kosovo is Serbia protest\\".Photos at Since 1999 Karadžić had been masquerading as a \\"new age\\" expert in alternative medicine using the fake name \\"D.D. David\\" printed on his business cards. The initials apparently stood for \\"Dragan Dabić\\"; officials said he was also using the name \\"Dr. Dragan David Dabić\\". He lectured in front of hundreds of people on alternative medicine. He had his own website, where he offered his assistance in the treatment of sexual problems and disorders by using what he called \\"Human Quantum Energy\\". =Allegedly evading capture in Austria= There were reports that Karadžić evaded capture in May 2007 in Vienna, where he lived under the name Petar Glumac, posing as a Croatian seller of herbal solutions and ointments. Austrian police talked to him during the raid regarding an unrelated homicide case in the area where Karadžić lived but failed to recognize his real identity. He had obtained a Croatian passport in the name of Petar Glumac and claimed to be in Vienna for training. The police did not ask any further questions nor demanded to fingerprint him as he appeared calm and readily answered questions. Nevertheless, this claim came into doubt when a man named Petar Glumac, an alternative medical practitioner from Banatsko Novo Selo, Serbia, claims to have been the person the police talked with in Vienna. Glumac reportedly bears a striking resemblance to Karadžić's appearance as Dragan Dabić. Dragan Karadžić, his nephew, claimed in an interview to the Corriere della Sera that Karadžić attended football matches of Serie A and visited Venice under the name of Petar Glumac. Trial=Arrest and trial= The arrest of Radovan Karadžić took place on 21 July 2008 in Belgrade. He was in hiding, posing as a doctor of alternative medicine mostly in Belgrade but also in Vienna, Austria. Karadžić was transferred into ICTY custody in the Hague on 30 July. Karadžić appeared before judge Alphons Orie on 31 July, in the tribunal, which has sentenced 64 accused since 1993. During the first hearing Radovan Karadžić expressed a fear for his life by saying: \\"If Holbrooke wants my death and regrets there is no death sentence at this court, I want to know if his arm is long enough to reach me here.\\" and stated that the deal he made with Richard Holbrooke is the reason why it took 13 years for him to appear in front of the ICTY. He made similar accusations against the former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Muhamed Sacirbey, Bosnian foreign minister at the time, claimed that a Karadžić-Holbrooke deal was made in July 1996. In August 2008 Karadžić claimed there is a conspiracy against him and refused to enter a plea, whereupon the court entered a plea of not guilty on his behalf to all 11 charges. He called the tribunal, chaired by Scottish judge Iain Bonomy, a \\"court of NATO\\" disguised as a court of the international community. On 13 October 2009, the BBC reported that Karadžić's plea to be granted immunity from his charges was denied. However, the start of his trial was moved to 26 October so he could prepare a defense. On Monday 26 October 2009 Karadžić's trial was suspended after 15 minutes after he carried out his threat to boycott the start of the hearing. Judge O-Gon Kwon said that in the absence of Karadžić, who was defending himself, or any lawyer representing him, he was suspending the case for 24 hours, when the prosecution would begin its opening statement. On 5 November 2009, the court imposed a lawyer on him, and postponed his trial until 1 March 2010. On 26 November 2009, Karadžić filed a motion challenging the legal validity and legitimacy of the tribunal, claiming that \\"the UN Security Council lacked the power to establish the ICTY, violated agreements under international law in so doing, and delegated non-existent legislative powers to the ICTY\\", to which the Prosecution response was that \\"The Appeals Chamber has already determined the validity of the Tribunal’s creation in previous decisions which constitute established precedent on this issue\\", therefore dismissing the Motion. The prosecution started its case on 13 April 2010, and completed it on 25 May 2012. The discovery of more than 300 previously unknown bodies in a mass grave at the Tomasica mine near Prijedor in September 2013 caused a flurry of motions which ended with the court denying reopening prosecutorial evidence. The defence began its case on 16 October 2012 and completed it in March 2014; Karadžić decided not to testify. Closing arguments in the case began on 29 September 2014 and were concluded on 7 October 2014,Case information sheet: Radovan Karadžić, ICTY Karadžić having failed in his demand for a re-trial. =Bosnian genocide trial= Karadžić and Mladić were placed on trial for charges of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes committed in Srebrenica, Prijedor, Ključ, and other districts of Bosnia. They were charged, separately, with:Paul R. Bartrop. (20116). Bosnian Genocide: The Essential Reference Guide, p. 113\\\\. ABC-CLIO. . * Count 1: Genocide. On 28 June 2012, the trial chamber granted a defence motion for acquittal on this count as \\"the evidence, even if taken at its highest, did not reach the level from which a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that genocide occurred in the municipalities [in question]\\". Motions for acquittal on nine other counts were dismissed. The Appeals Chamber subsequently concluded that the court had erred and reinstated Count 1 on 11 July 2013. ** Municipalities: Bratunac, Foča, Ključ, Kotor Varoš, Prijedor, Sanski Most, Vlasenica and Zvornik. * Count 2: Genocide. ** Municipality: Srebrenica. * Count 3: Persecutions on Political, Racial and Religious Grounds, a Crime Against Humanity. ** Municipalities: Banja Luka, Bijeljina, Bosanska Krupa, Bosanski Novi, Bratunac, Brčko, Foča, Hadžići, Ilidža, Kalinovik, Ključ, Kotor Varoš, Novo Sarajevo, Pale, Prijedor, Rogatica, Sanski Most, Sokolac, Trnovo, Vlasenica, Vogošća, Zvornik, and Srebrenica. * Count 4: Extermination, a Crime Against Humanity. * Count 5: Murder, a Crime Against Humanity. * Count 6: Murder, a Violation of the Laws or Customs of War. * Count 7: Deportation, a Crime Against Humanity. * Count 8: Inhumane Acts (forcible transfer), a Crime Against Humanity. * Count 9: Acts of Violence the Primary Purpose of which is to Spread Terror among the Civilian Population, a Violation of the Laws or Customs of War. * Count 10: Unlawful Attacks on Civilians, a Violation of the Laws or Customs of War. * Count 11: Taking of Hostages, a Violation of the Laws or Customs of War. The Yugoslav war crimes court rejected on 27 June 2012 one of the two genocide charges against Karadžić. However, on 11 July 2013, the Appeals Chamber reinstated these charges. =Conviction and sentence= On 24 March 2016, he was found guilty of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, and sentenced to 40 years imprisonment. He was found guilty of genocide for the Srebrenica massacre, which aimed to kill \\"every able-bodied male\\" in the town and systematically exterminate the Bosnian Muslim community. He was also convicted of persecution, extermination, deportation and forcible transfer (ethnic cleansing), and murder in connection with his campaign to drive Bosnian Muslims and Croats out of villages claimed by Serb forces.

History  The Australian National University (ANU) Library has its foundations in the appointment of the first University Librarian, Arthur Leopold Gladstone McDonald (1898–1981) in early 1948 . The importance of the establishment of the ANU Library in the development of the University was such that McDonald was appointed by the Interim Council before any of the professors . Initially McDonald and several assistants were housed in Ormond College at the University of Melbourne , where they began to form the collection. At the end of 1950 the collection, which had grown to approximately 40, 000 volumes, was transferred to Canberra, to be located in the Canberra Community Hospital and nearby huts . Over the course of the 1950s the collection grew steadily, and by the time of McDonald's retirement in 1960 the collection had grown to 150,000 volumes (excluding pamphlets) .

ANU Archives  The ANU Archiveshttp://archives.anu.edu.au/home preserves the university's own archives and collects archives of business, trade unions, professional associations and industry bodies, to support research by the University community and the general public. It collects in two areas, the University Archives and the Noel Butlin Archives Centre. = University Archives = The University Archiveshttp://archives.anu.edu.au/anu-archives hold a range of material dating from the late 1920s relating to the history of The Australian National University. This material is available under a 30-year rule (progressing to a 20-year rule by 2021) which means that records up to the mid-1980s can be generally used for research. The collection includes minutes of the ANU Council and other University committees, correspondence files, photographs, plans, and publications such as annual reports and the ANU Reporter. The papers of academic and senior staff of the University and University organisations are also part of the University Archives. The acquisition of material is governed by a collecting policy. = Noel Butlin Archives Centre = The entrance to the Acton Underhill facility which houses the Noel Butlin Archives. The archives' reading room is located in the Menzies Library. The Noel Butlin Archives Centre (NBAC)http://archives.anu.edu.au/collections collects business and labour records from Australian companies, trade unions, industry bodies and professional organisations. They are a national organisation interested in material from all states and territories. The NBAC holds the records of large companies such as the Australian Agricultural Company, Burns Philip, CSR Ltd, Dalgety's,Tooth and Company and the Adelaide Steamship Company as well as those of smaller businesses such as pastoral stations. They hold records of federally registered trade unions and their predecessors, and of peak councils such as the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and the National Farmers Federation. The records date from the 1820s to the early 21st century and include files, photographs, minutes of meetings, some staff and membership records, maps and plans, and publications such as trade journals and union newsletters. Some material may be closed because it is very recent or the owners' permission may be required before it can be used. The collection supports research on topics such as industrial relations, immigration, working women, indigenous employment, architecture, economic history, family history, social history in Australia and the Pacific, and on particular industries such as agriculture, timber, shipping, mining, brewing, advertising and finance. In addition, the Archives contain the National AIDS Archive Collection, which documents the history of HIV/AIDS education and prevention throughout Australia. The Noel Butlin Archives collection is divided into the following categories: Companies, Organisations including trade unions and professional associations, Personal Papers, National AIDS Archive Collection, Maps, Photographs. The acquisition of material is governed by a collecting policy. The site, and the collection, received considerable public attention after it was featured by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's station, ABC Local Radio 666AM, in early January 2014, including an online story.

Actually, until the late 1990s, the highest waterfalls in Serbia are believed to be 25 to 30 meters. Since then, several waterfalls were discovered in the previously geologically unexplored areas of the south-eastern Serbia (namely, the Visok region), including some of the highest ones, changing the geography of Serbia.  Kaluđerski skokovi  Kaluđerski Skokovi () is the highest waterfall in Serbia. It was discovered in 2012 and measured on 9 June 2012. It is 232 meters high.  Kopren Waterfall  Kopren Waterfall () is the second highest waterfall in Serbia. It is located on Stara Planina mountain in southeast Serbia, in Pirot municipality. Kopren height is 103,5 meters, and its altitude is 1,820 meters.vodopadisrbije.com Kopren (Stara planina)  Jelovarnik  Jelovarnik waterfall (Јеловарник); with the reported combined height of 71 or 80 meters in three cascades, it is the third highest waterfall in Serbia.

Close to the higher Čungulj and Pilj waterfalls. It is 27 meters high and also known as Kurtuljski skok (Kurtulj jump).  Lisine (Veliki Buk)  Lisine or Veliki Buk waterfall (Лисине or Велики Бук); located on the Resava River in the east Serbia. It is carved in the karst area, where the sinking river of the Resava springs again from the ground in the canyon-type valley of Sklop. With the height of 25 meters, it was considered the highest waterfall in Serbia until the 1990s when three higher ones were discovered in the Visok region.  Radavac  Radavac waterfall (Радавац); located right after the strong spring of the White Drin which here resurfaces after flowing underground for a while. The spring and the 25 meters high waterfall were protected by the state in 1982.  Miruša  Miruša / Miruša waterfall Miruša waterfalls (Мируша, Albanian: Mirusha); located on the Miruša river, a tributary to the White Drin, in the Metohija region of Kosovo. The river carved a 10 kilometers long canyon and created 13 river lakes with waterfalls between them, earning the name \\"Plitvice of Metohija\\". The highest waterfall, between the sixth and seventh lake, is 22 meters high. It is next to the hamlet Bublje and town of Mališevo. It is in the Režin Dol valley. Near the hamlet of Kijevski Potok.  Sopotnica  Sopotnica waterfalls (Сопотница); located in the south-western Serbia, near the town of Prijepolje, on the Sopotnica river. Combined height of several cascades is over . Its name is derived from an old Slavic word sopot, meaning strong spring or sudden waterfall (cf. Sopot). The name is onomatopoeic for the sound of running water falling down the cascades (\\"murmur\\", modern Serbian šapat, \\"whisper\\"). The Sopotnica river springs at an altitude of and flows down the slopes of the Jadovnik mountain to . The waterfall is loud, especially in spring when the snow melts. During winter, the waterfall partially freezes. The falling of the water begins almost right after the source, over the tufa terraces. The highest section is the Veliki Vodopad (\\"Big Waterfall\\"), with . There used to be much higher waterfalls, but local residents exploited the tufa stones during history, destroying waterfalls.  Skakalo  Skakalo waterfall (Скакало); located on the Manastirica river, near the mountain resort of Divčibare on the Mount Maljen, in the west Serbia. It is 20 meters high. The name means \\"jumping one\\" in Serbian.  Izubra  Čungulj waterfall Izubra waterfalls (Изубра); located on the Izubra river, a tributary to the Studenica river, in the south-western Serbia.

The matches were held on Saturday 26 July 2008 at the Rose Bowl in Southampton. Middlesex and Kent qualified for the final at the expense of Durham and Essex respectively. Middlesex eventually emerged as champions by 3 runs, posting a score 187/6 and Kent could only make 184/5 in their 20 overs. Semi-finals= 1st Semi-Final = Kent Spitfires v Essex Eagles  Kent progressed to the final after a 14-run victory in the first semi-final at the Rose Bowl. Having won the toss and electing to bat, openers Joe Denly and captain Robert Key compiled the opening fifty in just five overs. Key was first to fall, clean bowled to Danish Kaneria with the score on 58. Yasir Arafat was next in, and lasted 9 balls and 10 runs before falling to the same bowler. Denly top scored with 36, but he was the third man down, neatly stumped by James Foster. Most of the middle order chipped in with good runs, Martin van Jaarsveld with sixteen, Darren Stevens with 29 and Azhar Mahmood with 24. A late flourish from 2007 Finals Day hat-trick hero Ryan McLaren who faced just three balls for his unbeaten ten, as the Spitfires managed to compile a target of 174. Essex's opening stand of Ravinder Bopara, who was top bowler in the Kent innings (3-36 off 4 overs) and Mark Pettini started very well, putting on 78 for the first wicket before Bopara was caught off the bowling of James Tredwell. The dangerous Graham Napier followed almost straight away, and the steady rate of wickets to fall continued to the end of the innings. Pettini was the top scorer, hitting a 47-ball 54 but with a lack of support, the Eagles were always going to fall short. Three run outs didn't help either as the Eagles' chance at the Stanford Super Series ended. = Second semi-final = Middlesex Crusaders v Durham Dynamos  Middlesex put paid to the Dynamos' challenge with a convincing eight wicket win in the afternoon semi-final. Dale Benkenstein had won the toss and followed the earlier game in putting his own team in to bat first. Losing Michael Di Venuto for a third-ball duck didn't seem to help matters. It was then left to Paul Collingwood, Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Will Smith to hit the runs. However, as the innings wore on, the conditions began to favour the slower bowlers. This was reflected in the bowling of Shaun Udal and Murali Kartik. In the eight overs that they bowled, only 36 runs were conceded. The Dynamos were thus limited to just 138 off their twenty overs, Chanderpaul top scoring with 48. The Crusaders got off to a steady start with openers Billy Godleman and Ed Joyce, as they began to eke into the target. They had almost reached halfway by the time the first wicket fell. It was almost like London buses in that Middlesex went from 65 without loss, to 65 for 2 with the loss of Godleman for 20 and Joyce for 41. But no more wickets were to fall as an unbeaten partnership of 76 between Owais Shah and Tyron Henderson allowed the Crusaders to advance. Henderson kept much of the strike, hitting a quite superb unbeaten 59 off only 21 balls, including 7 sixes, of which 3 came in the one over. This earned him man of the match, and earned the Crusaders a spot in the Twenty20 Champions League.

Etymology The ethnonym Yanomami was produced by anthropologists on the basis of the word , which, in the expression , signifies \\"human beings.\\" This expression is opposed to the categories (game animals) and (invisible or nameless beings), but also (enemy, stranger, non-Indian). According to ethnologist : History The first report of the Yanomami to the Western world is from 1759, when a Spanish expedition under Apolinar Diez de la Fuente visited some Ye'kuana people living on the Padamo River. Diez wrote: From approximately 1630 to 1720, the other river-based indigenous societies who lived in the same region were wiped out or reduced as a result of slave-hunting expeditions by the conquistadors and bandeirantes.John Hemming, Red Gold: The Conquest of the Brazilian Indians, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1978. How this affected the Yanomami is unknown. Sustained contact with the outside world began in the 1950s with the arrival of members of the New Tribes MissionRitchie, Mark Andrew. Spirit of the Rainforest: A Yanomamo Shaman's Story. as well as Catholic missionaries from the Society of Jesus and Salesians of Don Bosco. In Roraima, the 1970s saw the implementation of development projects within the framework of the \\"National Integration Plan\\" launched by the Brazilian military governments of the time. This meant the opening of a stretch of perimeter road (1973–76) and various colonization programs on land traditionally occupied by the Yanomami. During the same period, the Amazonian resources survey project RADAM (1975) detected important mineral deposits in the region. This triggered a progressive movement of gold prospectors, which after 1987 took the form of a real gold rush. Hundreds of clandestine runways were opened by gold miners in the major tributaries of the Branco River between 1987 and 1990. The number of gold miners in the Yanomami area of Roraima was then estimated at 30 to 40 thousand, about five times the indigenous population resident there. Although the intensity of this gold rush has subsided greatly since 1990, gold prospecting continues today in the Yanomami land, spreading violence and serious health and social problems. Increasing pressure from farmers, cattle ranchers, and gold miners, as well as those interested in securing the Brazilian border by constructing roads and military bases near Yanomami communities, led to a campaign to defend the rights of the Yanomami to live in a protected area. In 1978 the Pro-Yanomami Commission (CCPY) was established. Originally named the Commission for the Creation of a Yanomami Park, it is a Brazilian non-governmental nonprofit organization dedicated to the defense of the territorial, cultural, and civil and political rights of the Yanomami. CCPY devoted itself to a long national and international campaign to inform and sensitize public opinion and put pressure on the Brazilian government to demarcate an area suited to the needs of the Yanomami. After 13 years the Yanomami indigenous land was officially demarcated in 1991 and approved and registered in 1992, thus ensuring that indigenous people had the constitutional right to the exclusive use of almost located in the States of Roraima and Amazonas. The Alto Orinoco-Casiquiare Biosphere Reserve was created in 1993 with the objective of preserving the traditional territory and lifestyle of the Yanomami and Ye'kuana peoples. However, while the constitution of Venezuela recognizes indigenous peoples’ rights to their ancestral domains, few have received official title to their territories and the government has announced it will open up large parts of the Amazon rainforest to legal mining. Organization Location of the Yanomami peoples The Yanomami do not recognize themselves as a united group, but rather as individuals associated with their politically autonomous villages. Yanomami communities are grouped together because they have similar ages and kinship, and militaristic coalitions interweave communities together. The Yanomami have common historical ties to Carib speakers who resided near the Orinoco river and moved to the highlands of Brazil and Venezuela, the location the Yanomami currently occupy. Mature men hold most political and religious authority. A tuxawa (headman) acts as the leader of each village, but no single leader presides over the whole of those classified as Yanomami. Headmen gain political power by demonstrating skill in settling disputes both within the village and with neighbouring communities. A consensus of mature males is usually required for action that involves the community, but individuals are not required to take part. Local descent groups also play important roles in regulating marriages and settling disputes within villages. Domestic life Yanomami shabono Groups of Yanomami live in villages usually consisting of their children and extended families. Villages vary in size, but usually contain between 50 and 400 people. In this largely communal system, the entire village lives under a common roof called the shabono. Shabonos have a characteristic oval shape, with open grounds in the centre measuring an average of . The shabono shelter constitutes the perimeter of the village, if it has not been fortified with palisades. Under the roof, divisions exist marked only by support posts, partitioning individual houses and spaces. Shabonos are built from raw materials from the surrounding rainforest, such as leaves, vines, and tree trunks. They are susceptible to heavy damage from rains, winds, and insect infestation. As a result, new shabonos are constructed every 4 to 6 years. The Yanomami can be classified as foraging horticulturalists, depending heavily on rainforest resources; they use slash- and-burn horticulture, grow bananas, gather fruit, and hunt animals and fish. Crops compose up to 75% of the calories in the Yanomami diet. Protein is supplied by wild resources obtained through gathering, hunting, and fishing. When the soil becomes exhausted, Yanomami frequently move to avoid areas that have become overused, a practice known as shifting cultivation. Yanomami women in Venezuela Children stay close to their mothers when young; most of the childrearing is done by women. Yanomami groups are a famous example of the approximately fifty documented societies that openly accept polyandry,Starkweather and Hames, 2012 though polygyny among Amazonian tribes has also been observed. Many unions are monogamous. Polygamous families consist of a large patrifocal family unit based on one man, and smaller matrifocal subfamilies: each woman's family unit, composed of the woman and her children. Life in the village is centered around the small, matrilocal family unit, whereas the larger patrilocal unit has more political importance beyond the village. Males of the Yanomami are said to commit significant intervals of bride service living with their in-laws, and levirate or sororate marriage might be practiced in the event of the death of a spouse. Kin groups tend to be localized in villages and their genealogical depth is rather shallow. Kinship is critical in the arrangement of marriage and very strong bonds develop between kin groups who exchange women. Their kinship system can be described in terms of Iroquois classificatory pattern. To quote anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon, “In a word, everyone in Yanomamo society is called by some kinship term that can be translated into what we would call blood relatives.” The Yanomami are known as hunters, fishers, and horticulturists. The women cultivate cooking plantains and cassava in gardens as their main crops. Men do the heavy work of clearing areas of forest for the gardens. Another food source for the Yanomami is grubs.Ya̦nomamö: the fierce people (Chagnon 1968; Chagnon 1977; Chagnon 1983; Chagnon 1992; Chagnon 1998; Chagnon 2012) Often the Yanomami will cut down palms in order to facilitate the growth of grubs. The traditional Yanomami diet is very low in edible salt. Their blood pressure is characteristically among the lowest of any demographic group.\\"Yanomami Indians in the INTERSALT study\\" (accessed 14 January 2007) For this reason, the Yanomami have been the subject of studies seeking to link hypertension to sodium consumption. Rituals are a very important part of Yanomami culture. The Yanomami celebrate a good harvest with a big feast to which nearby villages are invited. The Yanomami village members gather large amounts of food, which helps to maintain good relations with their neighbours. They also decorate their bodies with feathers and flowers. During the feast, the Yanomami eat a lot, and the women dance and sing late into the night. Hallucinogens or entheogens, known as yakoana or ebene, are used by Yanomami shamans as part of healing rituals for members of the community who are ill. Yakoana also refers to the tree from which it is derived, Virola elongata. Yopo, derived from a different plant with hallucinogenic effects (Anadenanthera peregrina), is usually cultivated in the garden by the shaman. The Xamatari also mix the powdered bark of Virola elongata with the powdered seeds of yopo to create the drug ebene. The drugs facilitate communication with the hekura, spirits that are believed to govern many aspects of the physical world. Women do not engage in this practice, known as shapuri. The Yanomami people practice ritual endocannibalism, in which they consume the bones of deceased kinsmen. The body is wrapped in leaves and placed in the forest some distance from the shabono; then after insects have consumed the soft tissue (usually about 30 to 45 days), the bones are collected and cremated. The ashes are then mixed with a kind of soup made from bananas, which is consumed by the entire community. The ashes may be preserved in a gourd and the ritual repeated annually until the ashes are gone. In daily conversation, no reference may be made to a dead person except on the annual \\"day of remembrance\\", when the ashes of the dead are consumed and people recall the lives of their deceased relatives. This tradition is meant to strengthen the Yanomami people and keep the spirit of that individual alive. The women are responsible for many domestic duties and chores, excluding hunting and killing game for food. Although the women do not hunt, they do work in the gardens and gather fruits, tubers, nuts and other wild foodstuffs. The garden plots are sectioned off by family, and grow bananas, plantains, sugarcane, mangoes, sweet potatoes, papayas, cassava, maize, and other crops.Napoleon A. Chagnon (1992). Yanomamo. NY: Harcourt Brace College Publishers. Fourth edition. Yanomami women cultivate until the gardens are no longer fertile, and then move their plots. Women are expected to carry of crops on their backs during harvesting, using bark straps and woven baskets.Kenneth Good (1991). Into the Heart: One Man's Pursuit of Love and Knowledge Among the Yanomami. NY: Simon and Schuster. In the mornings, while the men are off hunting, the women and young children go off in search of termite nests and other grubs, which will later be roasted at the family hearths. The women also pursue frogs, terrestrial crabs, or caterpillars, or even look for vines that can be woven into baskets. While some women gather these small sources of food, other women go off and fish for several hours during the day.Alcida Rita Ramos (1995). Sanuma Memories: Yanomami Ethnography in Times of Crisis. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press. The women also prepare cassava, shredding the roots and expressing the toxic juice, then roasting the flour to make flat cakes (known in Spanish as casabe), which they cook over a small pile of coals.Schwartz, David M, with Victor Englebert. Vanishing Peoples Yanomami People of The Amazon. New York: Lothrop, Lee & Shepard Books. Yanomami women are expected to take responsibility for the children, who are expected to help their mothers with domestic chores from a very young age, and mothers rely very much on help from their daughters. Boys typically become the responsibility of the male members of the community after about age 8. Using small strings of bark and roots, Yanomami women weave and decorate baskets. They use these baskets to carry plants, crops, and food to bring back to the shabono. They use a red berry known as onoto or urucu to dye the baskets, as well as to paint their bodies and dye their loin cloths. After the baskets are painted, they are further decorated with masticated charcoal pigment. Female puberty and menstruation The start of menstruation symbolizes the beginning of womanhood. Girls typically start menstruation around the age of 12 to 13. Girls are often betrothed before menarche and the marriage may only be consummated once the girl starts menstruating, though the taboo is often violated and many girls become sexually active before then. The Yanomami word for menstruation (roo) translates literally as \\"squatting\\" in English, as they use no pads or cloths to absorb the blood. Due to the belief that menstrual blood is poisonous and dangerous, girls are kept hidden away in a small tent-like structure constructed of a screen of leaves. A deep hole is built in the structure over which girls squat, to \\"rid themselves\\" of their blood. These structures are regarded as isolation screens.Chagnon, Napoleon A. (1992). Yanomamo. New York: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston.An Yanomami girl at Xidea, Brazil in August 1997 The mother is notified immediately, and she, along with the elder female friends of the girl, are responsible for disposing of her old cotton garments and must replace them with new ones symbolizing her womanhood and availability for marriage. During the week of that first menstrual period the girl is fed with a stick, for she is forbidden from touching the food in any way. While on confinement she has to whisper when speaking and she may speak only to close kin, such as sisters or her mother, but never a male.Good, Kenneth, with David Chanoff (1988) Into the Heart. London: The Ulverscroft Foundation. Up until the time of menstruation, girls are treated as children, and are only responsible for assisting their mothers in household work. When they approach the age of menstruation, they are sought out by males as potential wives. Puberty is not seen as a significant time period with male Yanomami children, but it is considered very important for females. After menstruating for the first time, the girls are expected to leave childhood and enter adulthood, and take on the responsibilities of a grown Yanomami woman. After a young girl gets her period, she is forbidden from showing her genitalia and must keep herself covered with a loincloth. The menstrual cycle of Yanomami women does not occur frequently due to constant nursing or child birthing, and is treated as a very significant occurrence only at this time.Chagnon, Napoleon A.. (1974). Studying the Yanomamo. New York: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston. Language Yanomaman languages comprise four main varieties: Ninam, Sanumá, Waiká, and Yanomamö. Many local variations and dialects also exist, such that people from different villages cannot always understand each other. Many linguists consider the Yanomaman family to be a language isolate, unrelated to other South American indigenous languages. The origins of the language are obscure. Violence Traditional face painting In early anthropological studies the Yanomami culture was described as being permeated with violence. The Yanomami people have a history of acting violently not only towards other tribes, but towards one another.R. Brian Ferguson (1995). Yanomami Warfare: A Political History. Santa Fe: School for American Research Press.Ramos, A. R. (1987), Reflecting on the Yanomami: Ethnographic Images and the Pursuit of the Exotic. Cultural Anthropology, 2: 284–304. An influential ethnography by anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon described the Yanomami as living in \\"a state of chronic warfare\\". Chagnon's account and similar descriptions of the Yanomami portrayed them as aggressive and warlike, sparking controversy amongst anthropologists and creating an enormous interest in the Yanomami. The debate centered around the degree of violence in Yanomami society, and the question of whether violence and warfare were best explained as an inherent part of Yanomami culture, or rather as a response to specific historical situations. Writing in 1985, anthropologist , who had lived among the Yanomami for more than twenty years, stated: Anthropologists working in the ecologist tradition, such as Marvin Harris, argued that a culture of violence had evolved among the Yanomami through competition resulting from a lack of nutritional resources in their territory.Harris, Marvin. 1984. \\"A cultural materialist theory of band and village warfare: the Yanomamo test\\". in Warfare, Culture, and Environment, R.B. Ferguson (ed.) pp. 111–40. Orlando: Academic Press.Marvin Harris. 1979. \\"The Yanomamö and the cause of war in band and village societies.\\" In Brazil: Anthropological Perspectives, Essays in Honor of Charles Wagley. M. Margolis and W. Carter (eds.) pp. 121–32. New York Columbia University Press. However, the 1995 study \\"Yanomami Warfare\\", by R. Brian Ferguson, examined all documented cases of warfare among the Yanomami and concluded: Ferguson stresses the idea that contrary to Chagnon's description of the Yanomami as unaffected by Western culture, the Yanomami experienced the effects of colonization long before their territory became accessible to Westerners in the 1950s, and that they had acquired many influences and materials from Western culture through trade networks much earlier. Lawrence Keeley questioned Ferguson's analysis, writing that the character and speed of changes caused by contact with civilization are not well understood, and that diseases, trade items, weapons, and population movements likely all existed as possible contributors to warfare before civilization.Lawrence H. Keeley (1996). War Before Civilization: The Myth of the Peaceful Savage. Oxford University Press. Percentage of male deaths due to warfare in two Yanomami subgroups, as compared to other indigenous ethnic groups in New Guinea and South America and to some industrialized nations Violence is one of the leading causes of Yanomami death. Up to half of all of Yanomami males die violent deaths in the constant conflict between neighboring communities over local resources. Often these confrontations lead to Yanomami leaving their villages in search of new ones. Women are often victims of physical abuse and anger. Inter-village warfare is common, but does not too commonly affect women. When Yanomami tribes fight and raid nearby tribes, women are often raped, beaten, and brought back to the shabono to be adopted into the captor's community. Wives may be beaten frequently, so as to keep them docile and faithful to their husbands. Sexual jealousy causes much of the violence. Women are beaten with clubs, sticks, machetes, and other blunt or sharp objects. Burning with a branding stick occurs often, and symbolizes a male’s strength or dominance over his wife. Yanomami men have been known to kill children while raiding enemy villages. Helena Valero, a Brazilian woman kidnapped by Yanomami warriors in the 1930s, witnessed a Karawetari raid on her tribe: Controversies Gold was found in Yanomami territory in the early 1970s and the inevitable influx of miners brought disease, alcoholism, and violence. Yanomami culture was severely endangered. In the mid-1970s, garimpeiros (small independent gold-diggers) started to enter the Yanomami country. Where these garimpeiros settled, they killed members of the Yanomami tribe in conflict over land. In addition, mining techniques by the garimpeiros led to environmental degradation. Despite the existence of FUNAI, the federal agency representing the rights and interests of indigenous populations, the Yanomami have received little protection from the government against these intrusive forces. In some cases the government can be cited as supporting the infiltration of mining companies into Yanomami lands. In 1978, the militarized government, under pressure from anthropologists and the international community, enacted a plan that demarcated land for the Yanomami. These reserves, however, were small \\"island\\" tracts of land lacking consideration for Yanomami lifestyle, trading networks, and trails, with boundaries that were determined solely by the concentration of mineral deposits. In 1990, more than 40,000 garimpeiros had entered the Yanomami land.Kottak, Conrad Phillip (2004) Anthropology: the exploration of human diversity, 10th ed., p. 464, New York: McGraw-Hill. In 1992, the government of Brazil, led by Fernando Collor de Mello, demarcated an indigenous Yanomami area on the recommendations of Brazilian anthropologists and Survival International, a campaign that started in the early 1970s. Non-Yanomami people continue to enter the land; the Brazilian and Venezuelan governments do not have adequate enforcement programs to prevent the entry of outsiders.Chagnon, N. Yanomamo: Case Studies in Cultural Anthropology. 6th edition, Wadsworth Publishing, January 1, 2012; pp. 231–232. Ethical controversy has arisen about Yanomami blood taken for study by scientists such as Napoleon Chagnon and his associate James Neel. Although Yanomami religious tradition prohibits the keeping of any bodily matter after the death of that person, the donors were not warned that blood samples would be kept indefinitely for experimentation. Several prominent Yanomami delegations have sent letters to the scientists who are studying them, demanding the return of their blood samples. As of June 2010 these samples were in the process of being removed from storage for shipping to the Amazon, pending the decision as to whom to deliver them to and how to prevent any potential health risks in doing so.Couzin-Frankel, Jennifer (June 4, 2010). \\"Researchers to return blood samples to the Yanomamö\\". Science. Vol. 328, No. 5983: 1218. Members of the American Anthropological Association debated a dispute that has divided their discipline, voting 846 to 338 to rescind a 2002 report on allegations of misconduct by scholars studying the Yanomami people. The dispute has raged since Patrick Tierney published Darkness in El Dorado in 2000. The book charged that anthropologists had repeatedly caused harm—and in some cases, death—to members of the Yanomami people whom they had studied in the 1960s.\\"Never Mind\\", Inside Higher Ed, 29 Jun 2005 In 2010, Brazilian director José Padilha revisited the Darkness in El Dorado controversy in his documentary Secrets of the Tribe. Population decrease From 1987 to 1990, the Yanomami population was severely affected by malaria, mercury poisoning, malnutrition, and violence due to an influx of garimpeiros searching for gold in their territory. Without the protection of the government, Yanomami populations declined when miners were allowed to enter the Yanomami territory frequently throughout this 3-year span. In 1987, FUNAI President Romero Jucá denied that the sharp increase in Yanomami deaths was due to garimpeiro invasions, and José Sarney, then president of Brazil, also supported the economic venture of the garimpeiros over the land rights of the Yanomami. Alcida Rita Ramos, an anthropologist who worked closely with the Yanomami, says this three-year period \\"led to charges against Brazil for genocide.\\" = Massacres = The Haximu massacre, also known as the Yanomami massacre, was an armed conflict in 1993, just outside Haximu, Brazil, close to the border with Venezuela. A group of garimpeiros killed approximately 16 Yanomami. In turn, Yanomami warriors killed at least two garimpeiros and wounded two more. In July 2012 the government of Venezuela investigated another alleged massacre. According to the Yanomami, a village of eighty people was attacked by a helicopter and the only known survivors of the village were three men who happened to be out hunting while the attack occurred. However, in September 2012 Survival International, who had been supporting the Yanomami in this allegation, retracted their support after journalists could find no evidence to support the claim. =COVID-19 pandemic= On April 3, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a 15-year-old Yanomami boy from the Uraricoera River area was confirmed to have COVID-19 and was admitted to the intensive care unit at Roraima General Hospital in Boa Vista, before dying on April 10. According to the Brazilian Ministry of Health, this was the first confirmed Yanomami death and the third death due to COVID-19 in an indigenous tribe, and raised fears over the virus' impact on Brazil's indigenous peoples. Groups working for the Yanomami David Good, son of Yarima and her husband anthropologist Kenneth Good, created The Good Project to help support the future of the Yanomami people. UK-based non-governmental organization Survival International has created global awareness-raising campaigns on the human rights situation of the Yanomami people. In 1988 the US-based World Wildlife Fund (WWF) funded the musical Yanomamo, by Peter Rose and Anne Conlon, to convey what is happening to the people and their natural environment in the Amazon rainforest. It tells of Yanomami tribesmen/tribeswomen living in the Amazon and has been performed by many drama groups around the world.Yanomamo: An Ecological Entertainment The German-based non-governmental organization Yanomami-Hilfe e.V. is building medical stations and schools for the Yanomami in Venezuela and Brazil. Founder Rüdiger Nehberg crossed the Atlantic Ocean in 1987 in a Pedalo and, together with Christina Haverkamp, in 1992 on a self- made bamboo raft in order to draw attention to the continuing oppression of the Yanomami people.Rüdiger Nehberg ist tot, Die Zeit, 3 April 2020 (German) The Brazilian-based Yanomami formed their own indigenous organization Hutukara Associação Yanomami and accompanying website. =Comissão Pró-Yanomami (CCPY)= CCPY (formerly Comissão pela Criação do Parque Yanomami) is a Brazilian NGO focused on improving health care and education for the Yanomami. Established in 1978 by photographer Claudia Andujar, anthropologist Bruce Albert, and Catholic missionary Carlo Zacquini, CCPY has dedicated itself to the defense of Yanomami territorial rights and the preservation of Yanomami culture. CCPY launched an international campaign to publicize the destructive effects of the garimpeiro invasion and promoted a political movement to designate an area along the Brazil-Venezuela border as the Yanomami Indigenous Area.Berwick, Dennison. \\"Savages, The Life And Killing of the Yanomami\\" Macfarlane Walter & Ross (1992) This campaign was ultimately successful. Following demarcation of the Yanomami Indigenous Area in 1992, CCPY's health programs, in conjunction with the now-defunct NGO URIHI (Yanomami for \\"forest\\"), succeeded in reducing the incidence of malaria among the Brazilian Yanomami by educating Yanomami community health agents in how to diagnose and treat malaria. Between 1998 and 2001 the incidence of malaria among Brazilian Yanomami Indians dropped by 45%.The work of URIHI in the Yanomami Area, 2000–2004 In 2000, CCPY sponsored a project to foster a market for Yanomami- grown fruit trees. This project aimed to help the Yanomami as they transition to an increasingly sedentary lifestyle because of environmental and political pressures. In a separate venture, the CCPY, per the request of Yanomami leaders, established Yanomami schools that teach Portuguese, aiming to aid the Yanomami in their navigation of Brazilian politics and international arenas in their struggle to defend land rights. Additionally, these village schools teach Yanomami about Brazilian society, including money use, good production, and record-keeping.

She created an all-female group of ninja agents (Kunoichi) in service of the Takeda clan.Thomas A. Green, Martial Arts of the World (2001), p. 671.吉丸雄哉（三重大学人文学部准教授） (2017年4月). “望月千代女伝の虚妄”. In 吉丸雄哉、山田雄司 編. 忍者の誕生. 勉誠出版. . p. 282 Biography Chiyome, a descendant of the 15th-century ninja Mochizuki Izumo-no-Kami () of the Kōga-ryū, was the wife of Mochizuki Moritoki, a samurai lord of Shinano's Saku District and himself a distant relative of Izumo-no-Kami. After Moritoki was killed in the Fourth Battle of Kawanakajima in 1561, Chiyome was left in the care of the daimyō Takeda Shingen, the leader of the Takeda clan and an uncle of her late husband. It was then when Shingen approached her and gave her an important mission to recruit women and create an underground network of kunoichi (female ninja) and employ them against the rival warlords. Takeda's plan was to have fully trained female operatives who could act as spies and agents used to gather information and deliver coded messages to his allies; Chiyome was the best candidate for this, since she came from a long line of Kōga ninja. She accepted the task, set up her operation in the village of Nezu (jp:祢津村) in the Shinshū region (the present- day city of Tōmi, Nagano), and began her search for potential candidates for training. Chiyome recruited prostitutes and other wayward women, victims of the civil wars of the Sengoku period, and young girls who were either orphaned, lost or abandoned. Many people believed that she was helping these women and giving them an opportunity to start up a new life, but in reality they were trained to become information gatherers and verifiers, seductresses, messengers and, when necessary, assassins. The women were taught all the skills of a miko (Shinto shrine maiden or a wandering priestess), which allowed them to travel virtually anywhere without suspicion, receiving religious education to complete their disguise. Over time, Chiyome's kunoichi learned to effectively use more disguises such as actresses, prostitutes or geisha, which allowed them to move freely within villages, towns, castles and temples, and get access to their targets. Eventually, Chiyome and her kunoichi had set up an extensive network of some 200–300 agents that served the Takeda clan and Shingen was always informed of all activities, putting him one step ahead of his opponents at all times until his mysterious death in 1573, after which she disappeared from historical records.Stephen K.

Historicity dispute It has been alleged that her name has appeared only after the 1971 book Investigation of Japanese History (考証日本史) was written by non-academic writer Shisei Inagaki (稲垣史生).Yoshimaru In this book, Inagaki: # Describes the details of the Fourth Battle of Kawanakajima.Yoshimaru # Claims that Moritoki Mochizuki was a husband of Chiyome and that he died at this battle.Yoshimaru # Presents a historical written permission to Chiyome issued by Shingen and claims that, due to this permission, the \\"miko village\\" emerged.Yoshimaru # Claims that the miko of the village became spies.Yoshimaru # Claims that Chiyome then became a ninja. However, Katsuya Yoshimaru (吉丸雄哉), an associate professor of Mie University who studies Japanese Edo period literature and the ninja, claims that Chiyome did not actually exist and lists the allegedly erroneous points of Inagaki's book: # There is no historical document describing the details of this battle.Yoshimaru # Moritoki did not die in this battle.Yoshimaru # This written permission is not extant.Yoshimaru Generally speaking, most of such kind of written permissions are forged ones.Yoshimaru # The claim of spy activities of the miko is groundless; it is based only on guess of Inagaki.Yoshimaru # This is groundless as well. Although Inagaki refers History of Japanese Miko (日本巫女史), 1930, written by Taro Nakayama (中山太郎), this book says nothing about ninjaYoshimaru and all mentions first appear in Inagaki's book. The name of Chiyome became popular after a two-page article about her was published in a 1991 special issue of the magazine History Reader (歴史読本) titled Extraordinary Special Issue: All the Definitive Types of Ninja (臨時増刊号『決定版「忍者」の全て』).Yoshimaru This article said that Chiyome was an upper ninja (上忍); according to Yoshimaru, historically there was no such rank in a ninja hierarchy.Yoshimaru In popular culture Mochizuki Chiyome is featured in many video games (mostly Japan-exclusive social games) in which she is often shown in a partial or full miko costume, including Ayakashi: Ghost Guild, Blood Brothers, Chain Chronicle, Full Boko Heroes, Hero Hunter, Hyakuhime Ryoran!

One of several titles published by Evo Media, Queensland Pride is distributed throughout Brisbane and major regional centres in Queensland. The publication covers local, national and international news of interest to the gay and lesbian community, and has a strong focus on community news, arts and entertainment. Queensland Pride was first published as a monthly in January 1991, one month after the state of Queensland decriminalised male homosexuality. It was originally published as a newspaper, in a black-and- white newsprint format. It was the state's first gay and lesbian publication. Its founding editor was Raymond 'Wally' Cowin, who remained in the editorial role until February 2001. He was succeeded as editor by the then news editor Iain Clacher, who remained editor of the title until January 2009 when he died of a heart attack. Clacher was succeeded as editor by Peter Hackney. Scott McGuinness and Andrew Blythe also served in the role, before Andrew Shaw took over from June 2012 - April 2017. Shaw was previously editor of Melbourne LGBTI magazine MCV (Melbourne Community Voice) from 2000 to 2003 and 2009 to 2012. In March 2001, Queensland Pride began publishing fortnightly. It reverted to a monthly publication schedule in March 2004, shortly after publication of the title was taken over by a new company, Special Publications Australia. Special Publications Australia sold the title to Sydney-based Evolution Publishing in June 2007. From June 2007 the publication changed from a newsprint format to a high-quality, full-colour, full-gloss format. On 9 November 2012, under Evolution Publishing, fortnightly publication began and continued when the title was licensed to Evo Media in May 2013. In June 2015, following a major redesign, QP returned to a monthly publication schedule.  Controversy  In 2013, Queensland Pride became and remains under investigated by the Office of Fair Trading in Queensland for claiming in media kits that it was distributing 15,740 copies per issue at the end of 2012 when only 4,970 copies were going out, having the effect of misleading advertisers and the GLBTI community that were exposed to Queensland Prides claims.

He played junior basketball at an elite level, starting out with the strong Dandenong Rangers program and progressing to the Nunawading Spectres senior team in the ABA. Along with his academic merit, his basketball abilities earned him a scholarship at Haileybury College and in 2003, the same year Martin made the Australian under-20s representative side.http://www.theage.com.au/news/rfnews/a-player-with-a-lot-to-learn-and-a- history-of-achievement/2009/05/23/1242498972794.html He played a test series for Australia in New Zealand as a raw 17 year-old shooting guard.http://pakenham.starcommunity.com.au/gazette/2009-02-11/fun-turns-to- demon-desire/ Martin would graduate from Haileybury College with an entrance score of 99.75 in 2004 to finish in the top 40 Victorian students.https://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/brisbane-lions-player-stefan-martin- was-just-a-man-on-the-street-when-vox-popped-by-herald-sun/news- story/3d93e66ff31bf6a19a78f07255ad5675 He would go on in 2006 to study a science/law double degree. In 2006, while still playing basketball, Martin decided to give in to his mates and join them at amateurs football club, Old Haileybury. He was 19 and had never played a football game before. He shocked everyone when he arrived up to his first game with a slurpee and doughnut. Martin ended his first season by winning the under 19 best and fairest after polling 23 of a possible 24 votes, he had been given best on ground in eight of the nine games he played.http://www.theage.com.au/news/rfnews/a-player- with-a-lot-to-learn-and-a-history-of-achievement/2009/05/23/1242498972794.html Martin had an article written about him in the Herald Sun and some AFL clubs were interested in him, most notably Melbourne Football Club who invited him to train and although he was overlooked in the 2007, Martin was asked to play at the Demons' VFL affiliate side, Sandringham, so they could watch his development. Martin started 2007 in Sandringham’s reserves, but was playing for the seniors as a ruckman soon after. He impressed enough to be selected in the VFL Under 23 South side.http://websites.sportstg.com/club_info.cgi?c=1-118-10447-0-0&sID;=56266&articleID;=4882505&news;_task=DETAIL Later that year, much to his surprise, he was Melbourne's No. 3 pick in the 2008 pre-season draft. AFL Career=Melbourne= He made his debut in Round 14 for Melbourne's match against the Brisbane Lions at the MCG as a 22 year old.Debutant may match up on Brown He put in a solid performance and Melbourne managed its second win of the season. Despite playing most of his time at VFL level as a ruckman Martin was used as a defender for Melbourne showcasing his great leap, versatility, speed and agility for his height. He went on to play the next 8 games for Melbourne averaging 13 disposals and 4 marks a game. He competed in the 2008 AFL Grand Final Sprint, narrowly placing second to Richmond speedster Matthew White who won off scratch. Martin was used as utility in 2009, beginning the season in the backline before being trialled in the ruck and up forward. He kicked six goals for the year from 19 games. Persistent hip injuries cruelled his 2010 campaign and Martin only managed two games in round 5 and 6. A late season return through the Casey Demons reserves failed to win him a recall to the senior side and the injuries eventually finished his season.http://demonwiki.org/Stefan+Martin 2011 was a breakout year for Martin, as he played the number one ruck role in the absence of the injured Mark Jamar. He played 21 games, mostly in the ruck, he also proved dangerous when moved forward, kicked 10 goals for the season. He averaged 17 disposals, 14 hitouts and 2 tackles per game and ended up finishing 8th in Melbourne's club best and fairest. Martin was expected to spend more time forward with the return of Jamar but injury and an inability to break into the side hurt Martin's 2012 campaign, and he played just seven matches for the season. After playing in round 1 and 3 he wasn't seen in the team again until round 14, but then played five in a row before a hip injury ended his year. =Brisbane Lions= On 26 October 2012, Martin was traded to the Brisbane Lions in exchange for Picks 52 (Matt Jones) & 71 (Daniel Nicholson). The Lions had planned Martin to play as a forward/ruck rotating with the first choice ruckman Matthew Leuenberger and first round draft pick Billy Longer. Martin's first season at Brisbane started well, with him playing a key role in the team's NAB Cup premiership side. He kicked goals in each of his first three AFL games with the Lions, before injuring his ankle early in the Round 4 clash against North Melbourne. Three weeks later he came back in the NEAFL but reinjured his ankle. It was not until round 19 that Martin would play in the NEAFL after his ankle injury.http://www.aflplayerratings.com.au/Ratings/Player/112327/Stefan-MARTIN He impressed for the Lions reserves and was back in the AFL side for round 20, he only gathered 6 disposals and 10 hitouts vs Richmond in a loss however suffered a hamstring strain that would effectively end his campaign. Martin only managed 5 senior games in 2013. After an injury plagued season in 2013, the start of 2014 looked to be another year of frustration for Martin as he continued through his second pre-season with the Lions with a combination of hamstring and back injuries, keeping him on the sidelines until round 9 of the AFL season. He played two NEAFL games and was back in the AFL team for round 12. With the trade of Longer to St Kilda and injury to Leuenberger and season- ending injury to Trent West, Martin was selected as Brisbane's first ruck vs the Bulldogs, he gathered 17 disposals, 32 hit-outs and six clearances against Will Minson who the All Australian ruckman the previous year.http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/teams/brisbane/brisbane-utility- stefan-martin-knows-hes-on-last-chance-to-prove-himself/news- story/352d96e009fa7cfa05631ecf1b47321f Martin would then relish the responsibility as first ruck and went on to be one of the Lions' best performers in the second half of the season, producing career best numbers almost every game.http://www.lions.com.au/player-profile/stefan-martin Martin's name was being thrown around in All Australian discussions, with his stats more than matching up against the best in the competition. He was ultimately overlooked in the All Australian squad due to only playing 12 games, but earned the first Brownlow Medal votes of his career, finishing on 3 votes in total. finish 11th overall in the Merrett-Murray Medal, but ranked second behind eventual winner Tom Rockliff in votes per game with 85 votes from his 12 games, an average of seven per game. Martin used his mobility and agility as a ruckman to average 22 disposals a game, which was the most of any ruckman. Stefan's breakout year was rewarded with a new contract too see him out until the end of 2016. Stefan continued on his great form from 2014 into 2015, he was the joint winner of the Merrett–Murray Medal as Brisbane's best and fairest, alongside Dayne Beams, Mitch Robinson and Dayne Zorko. He averaged 32 hit outs and 21 disposals from 20 games in 2015 (missing two games due to suspension). He finished off the year with a huge performance in round 23 against the Western Bulldogs with 50 hitouts and 32 disposals in a win, gaining 2 Brownlow votes. After two outstanding seasons Martin dropped his performance in 2016 due to a number of injuries and setbacks including a head knock from Steven May that made global headlines in Round 4 against the Gold Coast Suns. Martin surprised with a return the very next week but it wasn't until round 7 that he looked like his old self with a career high 51 hitouts and 22 disposals vs Port Adelaide. Martin's performance dropped in rounds 9 to 12 as Trent West was selected for Brisbane however once West was dropped back to the NEAFL, Stefan improved his numbers as the sole ruck.http://www.aflplayerratings.com.au/Ratings/Player/112327/Stefan-MARTIN Martin missed rounds 19 and 20 as he was rested due to soreness, he would play 20 games, averaged 16 disposals and 27 hitouts a game.http://afltables.com/afl/stats/players/S/Stefan_Martin.html# He claimed the Alastair Lynch Trophy for 3rd place in the Merrett–Murray Medal.

It was established in 1938, and was abolished in 1984. The main activity of the Commission was the construction tens of thousands of houses and flats in Melbourne and many country towns between the late 1940s and the early 70s, providing low rent housing for low income families. The most visible legacy of the Commission is the 47 or so high-rise apartment towers in inner Melbourne, all built using the same pre-cast concrete panel technology. History Establishment Through the 1920s and early 1930s, a campaign highlighting the dreadful conditions and moral dangers of the 'slums' of inner city Melbourne was led by social reformer Oswald Barnett. During the depression Oswald Barnett wrote a first major broadside entitled “The undisputed slums, an illustrated summary of a thesis submitted to the University of Melbourne exploring the slum problem in Melbourne.Oswald Barnett received high praise for his thesis which was later published by the Melbourne Herald Group and resulted in his appointment of the Housing commission in Victoria, serving from 1938-1948. In the run-down rented housing in the inner city areas deteriorated during the Great Depression, creating a 'housing crisis'. Barnett's campaigning against slums led to the establishment the Housing Investigation and Slum Abolition Board (HISAB) in July 1936. The HISAB's 1937 report found 3,000 houses 'unfit for habitation' and recommended the establishment of a Housing Commission. John O’Connor was the Commission's first chairman, while Oswald Barnett, Oswald Burt and Frances Pennington were appointed as part-time commissioners. The Housing Commission of Victoria was established under the Housing Act 1937 to improve existing housing conditions and to provide adequate housing for persons of limited means; the Slum Reclamation Act 1938 and the Reclamation and Housing (Financial) Act 1938 provided the framework for the Commission's work. On the passing of the legislation, the Victorian Premier, Albert Dunstan, declared the beginning of the Commission's activities as a 'war on slums', but also recognised the magnitude of the task before it. The legislation not only gave the Commission powers for housing construction and improvement, but also made it 'a planning authority in its own right'. Victorian Premier Albert Dunstan made a personal tour of the slum with the guidance of Oswald Barnett’s Slum Abolition Group, which proposed to use unemployment relief funds for the rehousing of slum occupants to rentals based on social rather than economic conditions. Commission's chief concerns however, were the 'slum pockets' which required 'excision' for the 'common good'. The Commission developed a plan of action in March 1938, concentrating its attention on 1,240 houses in lanes, rights-of-way and slum pockets, referred to in HISAB's earlier report. Slums were to be reclaimed and people rehoused. To house the people moved from the slum areas, the Commission needed to provide new homes. The Commission's first estate was an extension to the Garden City Estate in Port Melbourne, where pre-cast concrete technologies were employed for the first time. Next was the development of flats at Pigdon Street, Carlton, though the original proposal for three storey flats was reduced to two storeys after local opposition. The Commission then began to acquire cheap land in the northern suburbs of Coburg, Brunswick, Preston and Northcote as well as in inner suburban areas such as North Melbourne, Fitzroy and Richmond. The few estates built by the Commission before World War Two comprised modestly scaled suburban style housing, in simple brick construction, mostly as duplexes, such as the Racecourse Estate in Richmond, and the Railton Grove Precinct in Preston. The Commission's acquisition plans were ambitious and it was bound to come across difficulties. The synchronisation of the 'demolition program' was proving difficult and by June 1940, only 53 families had moved into new houses while only 99 houses had been ordered for demolition. The Commission also had difficulties dealing with local municipalities, in acquiring properties in the North Melbourne reclamation area as well as with the labour movement, who believed that the government should subsidise loans to enable workers to buy homes rather than rent them. The rehousing of those from the slums was a difficult task. As a landlord, the Commission also experienced problems. Tenants were initially reluctant to move, while rents on the estates were more expensive than in their former accommodation. At Fisherman's Bend, there was tension between tenants of the Commission's estate and those who had bought homes under an earlier housing program; vandalism was also a problem, both at Fisherman's Bend and in the West Brunswick estate. Frances Penington, who was also a social worker, advocated for community facilities to be built at the estates to alleviate some of these problems, these were built after protracted debate by others on the Commission. Transportation costs from the new estates to places of employment were also an issue. Despite these issues, residents 'adjusted to their new homes and locations' and appreciated the 'better home environment'. By 1942, building had halted as the Commission shifted its focus to post-war planning. It continued to acquire land though, taking advantage of low prices by purchasing land in industrial areas in the western suburbs as well as in the middle class eastern and southern suburbs. The Commission, in its planning authority capacity had also drawn up plans for the future development of Melbourne but by 1944, it was lacking resources to deal with backlogs of council plans. The Commission recruited Frank Heath from its advisory Architects Panel to deal with these problems but it was stripped of its town planning powers later in the same year. The Commission's 1944 report found that housing was required in 'large numbers as quickly as possible to house those recently returned to civilian life and catch up on the lag of construction over the war years'. The end of the slum abolitionism was in part due to the ambiguity surrounding what constituted a slum. Slum abolitionists were left disappointed because the sensationalism carried by the slum problem were communicated to the mainstream community over messages such as social inequity and social reform. While the Commission was planning for the future, so were its commissioners. Barnett and Burt published Housing the Australian Nation, reviewing the slum reclamation, but also putting forward their plans for a national housing policy. Barnett, Burt and Heath published We Must Go On calling for a fairer society and centralised planning. By now, housing for growing numbers was the main concern. Post War After World War Two, with greater funding and a severe housing shortage, the Commission's activities greatly expanded through the late 1940s into the 1950s. The began to build larger and larger estates of housing in the suburban fringes, as well as country towns, of both single homes and duplexes, from stylish Old English style double brick to simple unadorned prefabricated weatherboard. The compulsory purchase and demolition of blocks of 'slums' in the inner and middle ring suburbs also gathered pace, usually replaced by apartment buildings of various designs, from long two storey blocks of prefabricated construction placed diagonally on the blocks in a garden setting to concentrated blocks of concrete and brick four storey walk-ups. The Commission was keen to produce the largest number of house at the lowest cost, and in an era when prefabrication was widely regarded as the most efficient construction method, the Commission continued its pre-war development of precast concrete houses. In 1946 the former Commonwealth Tank factory building in suburban Holmesglen was leased to the Victorian Housing Commission, and transformed into a 'Housing Factory' for the production of prefabricated concrete houses and flats. The entire operation became a production line process and by 1948, 1,000 houses had been produced. In the middle 1950s, the factory was producing two to four storey walk up flats, and by 1964 the Concrete House Project was turning out pre-cast walls for villas as well as walk-ups and would soon be producing the components for high rise towers. Approximately 27 of these precast concrete 20 to 30 storey height buildings were constructed around Melbourne, until the type of development fell into disrepute. By 1970 nearly 4000 privately owned dwellings had been compulsory acquired and replaced by nearly 7000 high rise flats. Production then moved to low rise walk up and single dwelling units, with about 10,000 homes using locally engineered design and erection methods constructed using the technology. Public housing was also built in regional Victorian cities, such as Wangaratta, Wodonga and Geelong. In the period of the 1960s-70s large scale redevelopment of the Housing Commission of Victoria caused the displacement of low-income residents, living in boarding houses, cheap rental accommodation and public housing. For many of the former residents residing in the inner-city areas whose houses were demolished by the Housing Commission of Victoria, few were resettled in the inner city. In the early 1970s with the towers out of favour, the Commission turned back to building large suburban estates, including the creation of satellite towns in Pakenham, Sunbury and Melton. The purchase of the land however was poorly handled, the Commission spending $11 million on land, some of which was not suitable for housing, and handing handsome profits to speculators. This 'land scandal' led to a Royal Commission in 1979 which found no evidence of corruption. The Commission became part of a new Ministry of Housing in 1973, and in 1984 the Commission structure was abolished in favour of an Office of Housing within the Ministry of Housing and subsequent similar Ministries. In 2018, Public housing is administered by the Housing, Infrastructure, Sport and Recreation division of the Department of Health & Human Services.  Victorian Public Tenants Association  Victoria is the only State which has a peak body to represent people who live in public housing, and people on the waiting list. The Victorian Public Tenants Association was first formed in 2000 as a peak body for Tenant Groups. The organisation now represents people who live in public housing individually, as well as those who have applications on the joint public and community housing waitlist, the Victorian Housing Register. They operate a free telephone advice line, as well as advocate directly for system wide improvements to policies and procedures, urgent construction of more public housing and on other social justice issues that impact on people who are homeless, insecurely housed or living in public housing. 1960s high rises Housing commission in Carlton, Victoria. Collingwood There are 28 sites, spread across 19 suburbs in inner Melbourne that contain around 47 high rises in total. The largest sites contain four towers each as well as a numerous walk-up flats (many replaced in the 2010s); Elizabeth St, Richmond, Atherton Gardens, Fitzroy, Lygon Street Carlton and Racecourse Rd, Flemington. Other large sites contain three buildings; Boundary Rd, North Melbourne and Malvern Rd, South Yarra. The towers vary between 20–30 storeys in height and come in a variety of plan forms; S, T, Y, I, L and C-shape, the most common being the S-shape. The high- rises have become somewhat iconic, the instantly recognisable image of the Melbourne 'Housing Commission Tower Block' has been used in artworks, film and TV, and as a graphics on T shirts, bags and the like. =Sites= *Albert Park :*Victoria Avenue (Corner of Reed St), 1 building (I-Shaped) *Brunswick :*Barkly Street (Corner of McKay St), 1 building (S-Shaped) *Carlton :*Elgin Street (Corner of Nicholson St), 2 buildings (I-Shaped) :*Lygon Street (Lygon St), 4 buildings (2 S-Shaped, 1 Y-Shaped, 1 T-Shaped) *Collingwood :*Hoddle Street (Between Perry & Vere Streets), 2 buildings (S-Shaped) :*Wellington Street (Between Perry & Vere Streets), 1 building (S-Shaped) *Fitzroy :*Atherton Gardens (Brunswick St), 4 buildings (S-Shaped) *Flemington :*Crown St, 1 building (I-Shaped) :*Racecourse Road (Racecourse Rd), 4 buildings (4 S-Shaped) *Footscray :*Gordon Street (Corner of Shepherd St), 1 building (T-Shaped) *Kensington :*56 Derby Street, 1 building (L-Shaped) :*72 Derby Street, 1 building (L-Shaped) (demolished 1999) :*94 Ormond St, 1 building (I-Shaped) *North Melbourne :*Boundary Road (Boundary Rd), 3 buildings (1 S-Shaped, 1 Y-Shaped, 1 T-Shaped) :*Canning Street (Corner of Boundary Rd), 1 building (I-Shaped) *South Melbourne :*Park Towers (Corner of Park St and Cecil St), 1 building (C-Shaped) :*Emerald Hill Court (200 Dorcas St), 1 building (2 conjoined rectangular towers) *Northcote :*Heidelberg Road (Near Merri Creek), 1 building (S-Shaped) *Port Melbourne :*Evans Street, 2 buildings *Prahran :*King Street (Corner of Little Chapel St), 2 buildings (T-Shaped) *Richmond :*112 Elizabeth Street, 4 buildings (S-Shaped) :*Highett Street (Corner of Lennox St), 1 building (S-Shaped) *St. Kilda :*Inkerman Street (Corner of Henryville St), 1 building (T-Shaped) *South Yarra :*Malvern Road (Between Bray St & Surrey Rd), 3 buildings (2 Y-Shaped, 1 S-Shaped) *Williamstown :*Floyd Lodge (Corner of Thompson St and Hanmer St), 1 building (I-Shaped) :*Nelson Heights (Corner of Nelson Pl and Pasco St), 1 building (S-Shape) *Windsor :*Union Street, 1 building (S-Shaped) *Windsor :*Raleigh Street, 1 building *Various sites in: :Broadmeadows :Braybrook :Sunshine :Doveton See also * Public housing in Australia *HomeGround Services * Bendigo street housing campaign References *1960s High Rises: *New houses for old: fifty years of public housing in Victoria 1938–1988, edited by Renate Howe, Ministry of Housing and Construction, Melbourne. 1988. *Museum Victoria Website *Victorian Government Housing Website *Fitzroy: Melbourne’s First Suburb, cutten History Committee of the Fitzroy History Society, Melbourne University Press, Melbourne, 1991.

The top two teams from each of the three groups progressed to the quarter finals along with the two best placed third teams. The teams were redrawn and played one knockout match to decide the semi-finalists. Finals day was held on 26 July 2008. Quarter- Finals= 7 July = Durham Dynamos v Yorkshire Carnegie  The match at the Riverside was postponed in bizarre circumstances. The ECB received allegations about Yorkshire fielding an ineligible player in their final group game, against the Nottinghamshire Outlaws. In an original meeting on 10 July, Yorkshire were summoned to Old Trafford and were told that they were to be thrown out of the tournament, with Nottinghamshire to be reinstated in the draw.Yorkshire thrown out of Twenty20 However, Yorkshire appealed and at a second meeting held on 14 July, their appeal was heard and rejected, but this time Glamorgan were placed into the draw on a superior run rate. This was because Nottinghamshire were not awarded the points to the 27 June game.  Essex Eagles v Northamptonshire Steelbacks  Essex qualify for Finals Day, after a 59-run win at Chelmsford. Ravi Bopara top scored with a 26-ball 47, and was backed up by Graham Napier who added a 20-ball 40, to his record knock of 152* in the group stages. Grant Flower also added 33 from 31 deliveries, as Essex enjoyed the best of conditions, recording three 50+ partnerships. They ended on a total of 192 for 9, after losing their last five wickets for the princely sum of two runs, with South Africans Nicky Boje and Andrew Hall picking up two wickets each. Rain revised the Northamptonshire target to 175 in 18 overs, and never looked likely to reach that target, with the top five batsmen only scoring eleven runs between them. In fact, only three batsmen made double figures, as the Steelbacks fell a long way short, having recovered from 27 for 5. Boje top scored with an unbeaten knock of 58 from 43 balls, as Napier took 4-10 from his allotted four overs, earning him the man of the match. = 8 July = Middlesex Crusaders v Lancashire Lightning  Middlesex sealed their place in Finals Day, after a 12-run win at their \\"home\\" for one game, The Oval. This was of course down to their normal home of Lord's being used for the First Test against South Africa beginning 10 July. Middlesex made an uncertain start, losing openers Billy Godleman and Owais Shah with only two runs on the board. Things got worse and at one point, the Crusaders were 21 for 4. Coming in at number 6, was Dawid Malan who would go on to record the 24th century in the history of the tournament. Lasting 56 minutes, he scored 103 off 54, and helped to lift the total to 176 for 7 after their 20 overs. This performance also gave Malan man of the match. Only Eoin Morgan and Tyron Henderson would also reach double-figures as Andrew Flintoff was pick of the bowlers, taking 3-17 off his four overs. Lancashire's reply got off to a similar start to the Middlesex innings, with both openers Gareth Cross and Lou Vincent going cheaply. The third wicket of Stuart Law, fell with only fourteen runs on the scoreboard, and it looked ominous for the Lightning. Flintoff then stepped up, and hit a 41-ball 53, but when he fell to Steven Finn, it looked as if the game was up. Steady knocks from Kyle Hogg and Glen Chapple left the Lightning with eighteen to win, off the final six balls. However, Middlesex held out for victory, and progress to the second semi-final on Finals Day. = 9–10 July = Warwickshire Bears v Kent Spitfires  Kent kept their chances of retaining the Twenty20 Cup by hammering the Bears by 42 runs in a rain-delayed match at Edgbaston. The match was played on Thursday, as persistent rain had called off the game, 90 minutes before play on Wednesday. Having been put into bat, the Spitfires reached 37, before losing their first wicket, Joe Denly for 27. Coming to the crease with the score at 54 for 3, was hero of Finals Day last season and the man of the match in this game, Darren Stevens. He then proceeded to make a rapid-fire 69, coming from just 32 deliveries. He was the last wicket to fall, as Azhar Mahmood hit big runs towards the end of the innings, hitting two sixes in a 13-ball 25*. This set the Bears, a target of 176. Losing Neil Carter in the second over, did not help matters for Warwickshire, as they struggled at the beginning of their reply. Jim Troughton and Jonathan Trott fell in quick succession leaving Warwickshire on 42 for 3. The returning Darren Maddy and Ant Botha pushed the score higher, with Maddy scoring 27 off 18 deliveries and Botha top-scored with 35 off nineteen. However, it was to all be in vain, as the Spitfires' bowling attack always kept them below the 8.8 required run rate. Yasir Arafat was the pick of the bowlers with 3-29. = 22 July = Durham Dynamos v Glamorgan Dragons  Having waited fifteen days to play their quarter-final, Durham progressed to Finals Day on Saturday after a 44-run win at the Riverside. Having been put into bat, the visitors took three early wickets, removing dangermen Phil Mustard, Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Paul Collingwood, with the score only on 26. After Michael Di Venuto fell, Durham looked to be in some trouble. However, a fifth wicket partnership of 53 between Will Smith and captain Dale Benkenstein pushed the score up. Smith made 51 as Durham set a target of 164, for Glamorgan to chase. It could've been somewhat lower had it not been for virtuoso innings by Gareth Breese, smashing 20 off just 9 balls, and Liam Plunkett who hit 12* off 3. James Harris took 3 wickets, but accounted for around a quarter of the runs conceded. The Glamorgan reply could not have gotten off to a worse start, losing opener Richard Grant very first ball. David Hemp soon followed, becoming Plunkett's second victim, with only seven runs on the board. Glamorgan were always struggling with the run-rate, with most of the top-order recording strike rates of below 100. Only four players made it to double figures, with Jamie Dalrymple top scoring with 32, and had stern support from wicket-keeper Mark Wallace, who fired 26 off sixteen deliveries. However, Glamorgan fell a long way short with Plunkett, the pick of the Durham attack, taking 3-16 off three overs. Finals Day Durham, Middlesex, Kent and Essex qualified for the semi-finals from their quarter final ties. Durham were drawn to play Middlesex and Essex played Kent on 26 July 2008. Kent and Middlesex progressed to the final, which was won by Middlesex by 3 runs.

She served at the Battle of Camperdown in 1797 and captured two privateers before she disappeared in 1800. Construction and commissioning Martin was a , built to a design by John Henslow and ordered from Woolwich Dockyard on 17 January 1788. Master Shipwright John Nelson worked on her until August 1790, after which William Rule completed her. She was launched on 8 October 1790 and commissioned on 13 January 1791, having cost a total of £8,732 to build, with a further £1,674 spent on fitting out. Career Martins first commander was George Duff, under whom she sailed off the East coast of Scotland. On 17 March 1792, in the Firth of Forth, the brig Paisley ran into Hales Castle, which sank. Paisley rescued three of Hales Castles six crew and Martin rescued the other three. Martin came under the command of Commander Richard Lane in February 1793, followed by Commander James Newman in May 1794 and then Commander Charles Garnier in August 1794. Commander William Lobb took over Martin in April 1795, during which time she served as a Royal escort for Princess Caroline of Brunswick. Samuel Sutton received promotion to Commander on 1 September 1795 and replaced Lobb.United service Magazine (1832), pp. 499–501. Martin departed Britain for the West coast of Africa on 10 December 1795, followed by a voyage to Jamaica. Returning to British waters, on 14 February 1797 Martin and HMS Espion captured the privateer Buonaparte in the North Sea. Buonaparte was armed with sixteen 6-pounder guns (eight of which she threw overboard during the chase), and one long 12-pounder gun. She had a crew of 110, of whom 82 were on board. She had sailed from Cherburg on the 1st of the month, but had captured only a sloop in ballast, which the British were able to recapture. While Martin was in the North Sea she also transported the Duc d'Angoulême, the future Charles X of France, from Leith to Cuxhaven. On 27 June Sutton's service brought him promotion to post-captain. Martin immediately came under the command of Charles Paget, under whom she was present at the Battle of Camperdown on 11 October 1797. There she served to repeat signals for the starboard, or weather division under Admiral Adam Duncan, who was also the overall commander. In 1847 the Admiralty issued the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Camperdown\\" to the 298 surviving claimants from the action. In November 1797 Martin came under the command of Commander John Cleland; less than three months later, in January 1798, Commander William Renton replaced Cleland. In August, Martin captured \\"Three Greenland Vessels and One Dogger\\". Martin also shared in the capture on 24 October of the Dutch frigate Waakzaamheid. The primary captor was , which took Waakzaamheid and Furie in the Texel. Waakzaamheid was under the command of Senior Captain Neirrop. She was armed with twenty-four 9-pounder guns on her main deck and two 6-pounders on her forecastle. She had 100 Dutch seamen aboard her, as well as 122 French troops, and was carrying 2000 stands of arms as well as other ordnance stores. Waakzaamheid put up no struggle. The sloop , and the hired armed cutter Diligente, also shared in the capture. Renton, while dining with another naval officer in Harwich in February 1799, went to an adjoining room and committed suicide with a pistol. Renton apparently \\"had for some time discovered the symptoms of a deranged mind\\".The Monthly Magazine: Or, British Register ..., Vol. 7 (January 1799), p. 86. His successor was Commander the Hon. Michael Sinclair or St. Clair, the brother of Lord Sinclair. Commander Sinclair and Martin then escorted convoys in the North Sea to Denmark. On 28 April 1799 Martin captured the privateer cutter Vengeur some five leagues off The Skaw. Vengeur was in company with a lugger and another cutter, both of which escaped. Vengeur was armed with 14 guns and had a crew of 105 men under the command of Citizen Charles Louis Tack. (She may have thrown two guns overboard in the chase, and apparently only had 98 men aboard at the time of her capture.) She was out of Christiansand and had taken nothing. At this time Martin operated out of Leith. John Brougham, youngest brother of Lord Brougham, was appointed to her as a midshipman and as did Charles John Napier, the future admiral, whose father was a friend of Sinclair; Martin was Napier's first ship. Brougham left her at Yarmouth in early 1800 and Napier transferred to HMS Renown in May 1800. On 27 July Martin captured Hoffnung. Then on 8 and 9 October she captured Noodster and Jonge Isabella. Fate Martin disappeared without trace and with all hands in the North Sea in October 1800. She is presumed to have foundered in heavy seas.

When Petersen died in 2003,Bos Wars development team page on the official website François Beerten became the project's leader. The first v1.0 public release was in March 2004. In June 2007, the Stratagus game engine was merged with BOS and the game became known as . The game's community continued the development of the game for a time, but the last release was 2.7.0 in 2013.  Gameplay  The game map initially starts with a fog of war covering all areas which is not covered by the player's units range of view. As the units explore the map, the darkness is removed. Revealed areas which are not in view range are again darkened to hide enemy unit movement on those areas. All players have the same buildings and units. There is no research in the game so you can instantly build new buildings, aircraft, land vehicles and troops after you have collected enough resources to build them. The resources in the game are magma and energy. Magma is gathered by engineers or harvesters from rocks or manufactured by magma pumps from hot spots. Energy is gathered by engineers or harvesters from trees or morels, or manufactured by power plants. There are three types of structures: basic, unit, and defense. The basic structures are power plants, magma pumps, radar, cameras, and vaults. The unit structures are training camps, vehicle factories, hospitals and aircraft factories. Lastly, the defensive buildings are gun turrets, cannons, and missile silos.  Technical features  The game is written in C++ and Lua with the SDL library. The game uses a game engine based on the Stratagus engine. Originally the game data structure was separated from the graphical engine, but it was merged into the game in 2007, and the Stratagus project was merged into the Bos Wars project shortly after the engine change.

The Illyrian languages () were a group of Indo- European languages that were spoken in the western part of the BalkansIf the Messapian language was close enough to the Illyrian languages to be considered an Illyrian language, then Illyrian would also have been spoken in southern Italy. in former times by groups identified as Illyrians: Ardiaei, Delmatae, Pannonii, Autariates, Taulantii (see list of ancient tribes in Illyria). Some sound changes from Proto-Indo-European to Illyrian and other language features are deduced from what remains of the Illyrian languages, but because there are no examples of ancient Illyrian literature surviving: \\"While the Illyrians are a well-documented people of antiquity, not a single verifiable inscription has survived written in the Illyrian language.\\" (aside from the Messapian writings, if they can be considered Illyrian), it is difficult to clarify its place within the Indo-European language family. Because of the uncertainty,: \\"Though almost nothing of it survives, except for names, the Illyrian language has figured prominently in several theories regarding the spread of Indo- European languages into Europe.\\" most sources provisionally place Illyrian on its own branch of Indo-European, though its relation to other languages, ancient and modern, continues to be studied. Classification Illyrian was part of the Indo-European language family. Its relation to other Indo-European languages—ancient and modern—is poorly understood due to the paucity of data and is still being examined. Today, the main source of authoritative information about the Illyrian language consists of a handful of Illyrian words cited in classical sources, and numerous examples of Illyrian anthroponyms, ethnonyms, toponyms and hydronyms. Given the scarcity of the data it is difficult to identify the sound changes that have taken place in the Illyrian languages; the most widely accepted one is that the Indo-European voiced aspirates , , became voiced consonants , , ... A grouping of Illyrian with the Messapian language has been proposed for about a century, but remains an unproven hypothesis. The theory is based on classical sources, archaeology and onomastics. Messapian material culture bears a number of similarities to Illyrian material culture. Some Messapian anthroponyms have close Illyrian equivalents. A grouping of Illyrian with the Venetic language and Liburnian language, once spoken in northeastern Italy and Liburnia respectively, has also been proposed. The consensus now is that Illyrian was quite distinct from Venetic and Liburnian.: \\"We may begin with the Venetic peoples, Veneti, Carni, Histri and Liburni, whose language set them apart from the rest of the Illyrians.\\": \\"In Roman Pannonia the Latobici and Varciani who dwelt east of the Venetic Catari in the upper Sava valley were Celtic but the Colapiani of the Colapis (Kulpa) valley were Illyrians (north Pannonian), exhibiting names such as Liccaius, Bato, Cralus, Lirus and Plassarus.\\" =Centum vs. Satem= In the absence of sufficient lexical data and texts written in the Illyrian languages, the theories supporting the Centum character of the Illyrian language have been based mainly on the Centum character of the Venetic language, which was thought to be related to Illyrian, in particular regarding Illyrian toponyms and names such as Vescleves, Acrabanus, Gentius, Clausal etc.; . The relation between Venetic and Illyrian was later discredited and they are no longer considered closely related.. Scholars supporting the Satem character of the Illyrian languages highlight particular toponyms and personal names such as Asamum, Birzinimum, Zanatis etc. in which these scholars claim that there is clear evidence of the Satem character of the Illyrian language. They also point to other toponyms including Osseriates derived from /*eghero/ (lake). or Birziminium from PIE /*bherǵh/. or Asamum from PIE /*aḱ-mo/ (sharp).. Even if the above-mentioned Venetic toponyms and personal names are accepted as Illyrian in origin, it is not clear that they originated in a Centum language. Vescleves, Acrabanus, Gentius and Clausal are explained by proponents of the hypothesis that the Illyrian languages had a Centum character, through comparison with IE languages such as Sanskrit or Ancient Greek, or reconstructed PIE. For example, Vescleves has been explained as PIE *wesu-ḱlewes (of good fame).; ; . Also, the name Acrabanus as a compound name has been compared with Ancient Greek /akros/ with no signs of palatalization, or Clausal has been related to /*klew/ (wash, rinse).: \\"Clausal, river near Scodra, may be derived from an IE theme *klew- 'wash, rinse (: Gk. κλύζω, Lat. cluō, 'purge').\\" In all these cases the supporters of the Centum character of the Illyrian language consider PIE *ḱ > /*k/ or PIE *ǵ > /*g/ followed by an /l/ or /r/ to be evidence of a Centum character of the Illyrian language. However, it has been shown that even in Albanian and Balto-Slavic, which are Satem languages (with some uncertainty surrounding Albanian), the palatovelars have been generally depalatized (the depalatization of PIE *ḱ > *k and *ǵ > *g before /r/ and /l/ regularly in Albanian) in this phonetical position.; ; ; . The name Gentius or Genthius does not help either as there are two Illyrian forms for it, Genthius and Zanatis. If Gentius or Genthius derives from *ǵen- (\\"to be born\\"), this is proof of a Centum language, but if the name Zanatis is similarly generated (or from *ǵen-, \\"know\\") then Illyrian is a Satem language. Another problem related to the name Gentius is that it cannot be stated whether the initial /g/ of the sources was a palatovelar or a labiovelar.. Taking into account the absence of sufficient data and sometimes the dual nature of their interpretation, the Centum/Satem character of the Illyrian language is still uncertain and requires more evidence. Illyrian dialects The Greeks were the first literate people to come into frequent contact with the speakers of Illyrian languages. Their conception of \\"Illyrioi\\", however, differed from what the Romans would later call \\"Illyricum\\". The Greek term encompassed only the peoples who lived on the borders of Macedonia and Epirus. Pliny the Elder, in his work Natural History, still applies a stricter usage of the term Illyrii when speaking of Illyrii proprie dicti (\\"Illyrians properly so-called\\") among the native communities in the south of Roman Dalmatia. For a couple of centuries before and after the Roman conquest in the late 1st century BC, the concept of Illyricum expanded towards the west and north. Finally it encompassed all native peoples from the Adriatic to the Danube, inhabiting the Roman provinces of Dalmatia, Pannonia and Moesia, regardless of their ethnic and cultural differences. An extensive study of Illyrian names and territory was undertaken by Hans Krahe in the first decades of the twentieth century. He and other scholars argued for a broad distribution of Illyrian peoples considerably beyond the Balkans,. though in his later work, Krahe curbed his view of the extent of Illyrian settlement.. The further refinements of Illyrian onomastic provinces for that Illyrian area included in the later Roman province were proposed by Géza Alföldy.. He identified five principal groups: (1) \\"real Illyrians\\" south of the river Neretva and extending south of the provincial boundary with Macedonia at the river Drin to include the Illyris of north and central Albania; (2) the Delmatae who occupied the middle Adriatic coast between the \\"real Illyrians\\" and the Liburni; (3) the Venetic Liburni of the northeast Adriatic; (4) the Japodes who dwelt north of the Delmatae and beyond the Liburni, where names reveal a mixture of Venetic, Celtic and Illyrian; and (5) the Pannonian people north in Bosnia, Northern Montenegro, and western Serbia. These identifications were later challenged by Radoslav Katičić.; . who on the basis of personal names which occur commonly in Illyricum distinguished three onomastic areas: (1) South-Eastern Illyrian, extending southwards from the southern part of Montenegro and including most of Albania west of the river Drin, though its demarcation to the south remains uncertain; (2) Central Illyrian consisting of most of ex-Yugoslavia, north of southern Montenegro to the west of Morava, excepting ancient Liburnia in the northwest, but perhaps extending into Pannonia in the north; (3) Liburnian, whose names resemble those of the Venetic territory to the northeast. The onomastic differences between the South-Eastern and Central areas are not sufficient to show that two clearly differentiated dialects of Illyrian were in use in these areas. However, as Katičić has argued, the core onomastic area of Illyrian proper is to be located in the southeast of that Balkan region, traditionally associated with the Illyrians (centered in modern Albania)..Suić and Katičić question the existence of a separate people of Illyrii. For them, Illyrii proprie dicti are peoples inhabiting the heartland of the Illyrian kingdom; Suić, M. (1976) \\"Illyrii proprie dicti\\" ANUBiH 11 gcbi 11, 179-197. Katičić, R. (1964) \\"Illyrii proprie dicti\\" ZAnt 13-14, 87-97 Katičić, R. (1965) \\"Nochmals Illyrii proprie dicti\\" ZAnt 16, 241-244. This view is also supported in Papazoglu, F. (1989) \\"L'organisation politique de l'Illyrie meridionale (A propos du livre de P. Cabanes sur \\"Les Illyriens de Bardylis a Genthios\\")\\" ZAnt. 39, 31-53. Traditionally Illyrian has referred to any non-Celtic language in the northwestern Balkans. Recent scholarship from the 1960s and on tends to agree that the region inhabited by Illyrian tribes can be divided into three distinct linguistic and cultural areas, of which only one can be properly termed \\"Illyrian\\". No written texts regarding self-identification exist from the Illyrians and no inscriptions in Illyrian exist, with the only linguistic remains being place names (toponyms) and some glosses. Illyrian vocabulary Since there are no Illyrian texts, sources for identifying Illyrian words have been identified by Hans Krahe as being of four kinds: inscriptions, glosses of Illyrian words in classical texts, names—including proper names (mostly inscribed on tombstones), toponyms and river names—and Illyrian loanwords in other languages. The last category has proven particularly contentious. The names occur in sources that range over more than a millennium, including numismatic evidence, as well as posited original forms of placenames. There are no Illyrian inscriptions (Messapian inscriptions are treated separately, and there is no consensus that they are to be reckoned as Illyrian). The spearhead found at Kovel and thought by some to be IllyrianGustav Must, reviewing Krahe 1955 in Language 32.4 (October 1956), p. 721. is considered by the majority of runologists to be Eastern Germanic, and most likely Gothic, while a votive inscription on a ring found near Shkodër which was initially interpreted as Illyrian was shown to actually be Byzantine Greek.. Era The Illyrian languages were likely extinct between the 2nd and 6th centuries AD,: \\"Romanisation was total and complete by the end of the 4th century A.D. In the case of the Illyrian elements a Romance intermediary is inevitable as long as Illyrian was probably extinct in the 2nd century A.D.\\"Eastern Michigan University Linguist List: The Illyrian Language. with the possible exception of the language that developed into Albanian according to the theory of Albanian descent from Illyrian. It has also been posited that Illyrian was preserved and spoken in the countryside, as attested in the 4th-5th century testimonies of St. Jerome.: \\"Although they were to play an important role in the Roman army and even furnished later Rome with several famous emperors (including Diocletian, Constantine the Great and Justinian I), the Illyrians never became fully assimilated Romans and kept their language.\\": \\"Alongside Latin the native Illyrian survived in the country areas, and St Jerome claimed to speak his 'sermo gentilis' (Commentary on Isaiah 7.19).\\" See also *Albanian language *List of ancient cities in Illyria *Thraco-Illyrian *Messapian language *Thracian language *Paeonian language *Venetic language *Liburnian language *Pan-Illyrian theories ReferencesSources          Further reading  External links *Short Illyrian Glossary Paleo- Balkan languages Illyria Languages of ancient Macedonia Unclassified languages of Europe Unclassified Indo-European languages ","title":"Illyrian languages"},{"id":"18603828","text":"Polunin (feminine: Polunina) is a Russian-language family name.

He retired in October 2008 due to Italian government work regulations, after having served the company for 40 years. To pay tribute to him in occasion of his retirement, Lamborghini had labeled a 2009 edition to the Gallardo line-up, the LP550-2 Valentino Balboni. Biography Balboni started working for Lamborghini on 21 April 1968, as a mechanic apprentice in the company. Eventually, he was personally asked by the company's founder, Ferruccio Lamborghini, to test-drive the newly built cars alongside Bob Wallace. Valentino Balboni has reportedly driven about 80% of all Lamborghinis ever built. Among the marque aficionados, Balboni has risen to cult status. In 2008, Balboni was still active for the company as the chief test-driver and ambassador. Fluent in English and German, he often appeared at different Lamborghini-related events, such as new models' unveiling. In July 2009, Lamborghini announced a special edition run of 250 Gallardo LP550-2 \\"Valentino Balboni edition\\" supercars; the company stated that the new car was rear-wheel driven in accordance with Balboni's preference for the thrill of cornering a rear-wheel driven vehicle. These vehicles were also made special with a white and gold stripe that runs the center of the car, inspired by sports cars of the 1970s. Balboni, even though officially retired as chief test driver, has signed a two-year contract with Lamborghini as a consultant through 2010 that can be renewed multiple times. Valentino Balboni said that the first car that got him excited about cars was a silver Bizzarrini GT 5300 that he saw at the Turin car show in 1966. Media Valentino Balboni has made several appearances on television in different documentaries related to Lamborghini such as Top Gear, Jeremy Clarkson's Motorworld, Rides, as well as an episode of 60 Minutes from 1987.

They are closely related to the oligochaetes, which include the earthworm, and like them have soft, muscular, segmented bodies that can lengthen and contract. Both groups are hermaphrodites and have a clitellum, but leeches typically differ from the oligochaetes in having suckers at both ends and in having ring markings that do not correspond with their internal segmentation. The body is muscular and relatively solid, and the coelom, the spacious body cavity found in other annelids, is reduced to small channels. The majority of leeches live in freshwater habitats, while some species can be found in terrestrial and marine environments. The best-known species, such as the medicinal leech, Hirudo medicinalis, are hematophagous, attaching themselves to a host with a sucker and feeding on blood, having first secreted the peptide hirudin to prevent the blood from clotting. The jaws used to pierce the skin are replaced in other species by a proboscis which is pushed into the skin. A minority of leech species are predatory, mostly preying on small invertebrates. The eggs are enclosed in a cocoon, which in aquatic species is usually attached to an underwater surface; members of one family, Glossiphoniidae, exhibit parental care, the eggs being brooded by the parent. In terrestrial species, the cocoon is often concealed under a log, in a crevice or buried in damp soil. Almost seven hundred species of leech are currently recognised, of which some hundred are marine, ninety terrestrial and the remainder freshwater. Leeches have been used in medicine from ancient times until the 19th century to draw blood from patients. In modern times, leeches find medical use in treatment of joint diseases such as epicondylitis and osteoarthritis, extremity vein diseases, and in microsurgery, while hirudin is used as an anticoagulant drug to treat blood-clotting disorders. Diversity and phylogeny Haemadipsa zeylanica, a terrestrial leech Placobdelloides siamensis, a parasite of turtles in Thailand. The ventral face (right) shows many young leeches. Some 680 species of leech have been described, of which around 100 are marine, 480 freshwater and the remainder terrestrial. Among the true leeches, Euhirudinea, the smallest is about long, and the largest is the giant Amazonian leech, Haementeria ghilianii, which can reach . Except for Antarctica, leeches are found throughout the world but are at their most abundant in temperate lakes and ponds in the northern hemisphere. The majority of freshwater leeches are found in the shallow, vegetated areas on the edges of ponds, lakes and slow- moving streams; very few species tolerate fast-flowing water. In their preferred habitats, they may occur in very high densities; in a favourable environment with water high in organic pollutants, over 10,000 individuals were recorded per square metre (over 930 per square foot) under rocks in Illinois. Some species aestivate during droughts, burying themselves in the sediment, and can lose up to 90% of their bodyweight and still survive. Among the freshwater leeches are the Glossiphoniidae, dorso-ventrally flattened animals mostly parasitic on vertebrates such as turtles, and unique among annelids in both brooding their eggs and carrying their young on the underside of their bodies. The terrestrial Haemadipsidae are mostly native to the tropics and subtropics, while the aquatic Hirudinidae have a wider global range; both of these feed largely on mammals, including humans. A distinctive family is the Piscicolidae, marine or freshwater ectoparasites chiefly of fish, with cylindrical bodies and usually well-marked, bell-shaped, anterior suckers. Not all leeches feed on blood; the Erpobdelliformes, freshwater or amphibious, are carnivorous and equipped with a relatively large, toothless mouth to ingest insect larvae, molluscs, and other annelid worms, which are swallowed whole. In turn, leeches are prey to fish, birds, and invertebrates. The name for the subclass, Hirudinea, comes from the Latin hirudo (genitive hirudinis), a leech; the element -bdella found in many leech group names is from the Greek βδέλλα bdella, also meaning leech. The name Les hirudinées was given by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in 1818. Leeches were traditionally divided into two infraclasses, the Acanthobdellidea and the Euhirudinea (true leeches). The Euhirudinea are divided into the proboscis-bearing Rhynchobdellida and the rest, including some jawed species, the \\"Arhynchobdellida\\", without a proboscis. The phylogenetic tree of the leeches and their annelid relatives is based on molecular analysis (2019) of DNA sequences. Both the former classes \\"Polychaeta\\" (bristly marine worms) and \\"Oligochaeta\\" (including the earthworms) are paraphyletic: in each case the complete groups (clades) would include all the other groups shown below them in the tree. The Branchiobdellida are sister to the leech clade Hirudinida, which approximately corresponds to the traditional subclass Hirudinea. The main subdivision of leeches is into the Rhynchobdellida and the Arhynchobdellida, though the Acanthobdella are sister to the clade that contains these two groups. =Evolution= Fossil of a possible leech from the Silurian of Wisconsin The most ancient annelid group consists of the free- living polychaetes that evolved in the Cambrian period, being plentiful in the Burgess Shale about 500;million years ago. Oligochaetes evolved from polychaetes and the leeches branched off from the oligochaetes. Both the oligochaetes and the leeches, having no hard parts, do not fossilise well. The oldest leech fossils are from the Jurassic period around 150;million years ago, but a fossil with external ring markings found in Wisconsin in the 1980s, with what appears to be a large sucker, seems to extend the group's evolutionary history back to the Silurian, some 437;million years ago. Anatomy and physiology Leeches show a remarkable similarity to each other in morphology, very different from typical annelids which are basically cylindrical, with a fluid-filled space, the coelom (body cavity). In leeches, the coelom is reduced to four slender longitudinal channels, and the interior of the body is filled with a solid dermis in between the various organs. Typically, the body is dorso-ventrally flattened and tapers at both ends. Longitudinal and circular muscles in the body wall are supplemented by diagonal muscles, giving the leech the ability to adopt a large range of body shapes and show great flexibility. Most leeches have a sucker at both the anterior (front) and posterior (back) ends, but some primitive leeches have a single sucker at the back. Leech anatomy in cross-section: the body is solid, the coelom (body cavity) reduced to channels, with circular, longitudinal, and transverse muscles making the animal strong and flexible. Like other annelids, the leech is a segmented animal, but unlike other annelids, the segmentation is masked by external ring markings (annulations). The number of annulations varies, both between different regions of the body and between species. In one species, the body surface is divided into 102 annuli, but the body consists of 33 segments, a number constant across all leech species. Of these segments, the first five are designated as the head and include the anterior brain, several ocelli (eyespots) dorsally and the sucker ventrally. The following 21 mid-body segments each contain a nerve ganglion, and between them contain two reproductive organs, a single female gonopore and nine pairs of testes. The last seven segments contain the posterior brain and are fused to form the animal's tail sucker. The body wall consists of a cuticle, an epidermis and a thick layer of fibrous connective tissue in which are embedded the circular muscles, the diagonal muscles and the powerful longitudinal muscles. There are also dorso-ventral muscles. The coelomic channels run the full length of the body, the two main ones being on either side; these have taken over the function of the hemal system (blood vessels) in other annelids. Part of the lining epithelium consists of chloragogen cells which are used for the storage of nutrients and in excretion. There are 10 to 17 pairs of metanephridia (excretory organs) in the mid-region of the leech. From these, ducts typically lead to a urinary bladder, which empties to the outside at a nephridiopore. =Reproduction and development= Leeches are protandric hermaphrodites, with the male reproductive organs, the testes, maturing first and the ovaries later. In hirudinids, a pair will line up with the clitellar regions in contact, with the anterior end of one leech pointing towards the posterior end of the other; this results in the male gonopore of one leech being in contact with the female gonopore of the other. The penis passes a spermatophore into the female gonopore and sperm is transferred to, and probably stored in, the vagina. Some jawless leeches (Rhynchobdellida) and proboscisless leeches (Arhynchobdellida) lack a penis, and in these, sperm is passed from one individual to another by hypodermic injection. The leeches intertwine and grasp each other with their suckers. A spermatophore is pushed by one through the integument of the other, usually into the clitellar region. The sperm is liberated and passes to the ovisacs, either through the coelomic channels or interstitially through specialist \\"target tissue\\" pathways. Some time after copulation, the small, relatively yolkless eggs are laid. In most species, an albumin-filled cocoon is secreted by the clitellum and receives one or more eggs as it passes over the female gonopore. In the case of the North American Erpobdella punctata, the clutch size is about five eggs, and some ten cocoons are produced. Each cocoon is fixed to a submerged object, or in the case of terrestrial leeches, deposited under a stone or buried in damp soil. The cocoon of Hemibdella soleae is attached to a suitable fish host. The glossiphoniids brood their eggs, either by attaching the cocoon to the substrate and covering it with their ventral surface, or by securing the cocoon to their ventral surface, and even carrying the newly hatched young to their first meal. When breeding, most marine leeches leave their hosts and become free-living in estuaries. Here they produce their cocoons, after which the adults of most species die. When the eggs hatch, the juveniles seek out potential hosts when these approach the shore. Leeches mostly have an annual or biannual life cycle. =Feeding and digestion= About three quarters of leech species are parasites that feed on the blood of a host, while the remainder are predators. Leeches either have a pharynx that they can protrude, commonly called a proboscis, or a pharynx that they cannot protrude, which in some groups is armed with jaws. In the proboscisless leeches, the jaws (if any) of Arhynchobdellids are at the front of the mouth, and have three blades set at an angle to each other. In feeding, these slice their way through the skin of the host, leaving a Y-shaped incision. Behind the blades is the mouth, located ventrally at the anterior end of the body. It leads successively into the pharynx, a short oesophagus, a crop (in some species), a stomach and a hindgut, which ends at an anus located just above the posterior sucker. The stomach may be a simple tube, but the crop, when present, is an enlarged part of the midgut with a number of pairs of ceca that store ingested blood. The leech secretes an anticoagulant, hirudin, in its saliva which prevents the blood from clotting before ingestion. A mature medicinal leech may feed only twice a year, taking months to digest a blood meal. Leech bites on a cow's udder The bodies of predatory leeches are similar, though instead of a jaw many have a protrusible proboscis, which for most of the time they keep retracted into the mouth. Such leeches are often ambush predators that lie in wait until they can strike prey with the proboscises in a spear-like fashion. Predatory leeches feed on small invertebrates such as snails, earthworms and insect larvae. The prey is usually sucked in and swallowed whole. Some Rhynchobdellida however suck the soft tissues from their prey, making them intermediate between predators and blood-suckers. Leech attacking a slug Blood-sucking leeches use their anterior suckers to connect to hosts for feeding. Once attached, they use a combination of mucus and suction to stay in place while they inject hirudin into the hosts' blood. In general, blood- feeding leeches are non host-specific, and do little harm to their host, dropping off after consuming a blood meal. Some marine species however remain attached until it is time to reproduce. If present in great numbers on a host, these can be debilitating, and in extreme cases, cause death. Leeches are unusual in that they do not produce amylases, lipases or endopeptidases. This lack of endopeptidases means the mechanism of protein digestion cannot follow the same sequence as it would in all other animals in which endopeptidases first split proteins into peptides, and the exopeptidases then degrade the peptides. Leeches produce intestinal exopeptidases which remove amino acids from the long protein molecules one by one, possibly aided by proteases from endosymbiotic bacteria in the hindgut. This evolutionary choice of exopeptic digestion in Hirudinea distinguishes these carnivorous clitellates from oligochaetes, and may explain why digestion in leeches is so slow. A deficiency of digestive enzymes and of B complex vitamins is compensated for by enzymes and vitamins produced by endosymbiotic microflora. In Hirudo medicinalis, these supplementary factors are produced by an obligatory mutualistic relationship with two bacterial species, Aeromonas veronii and a still-uncharacterised Rikenella species. Non-bloodsucking leeches, such as Erpobdella punctata, are host to three bacterial symbionts, Pseudomonas, Aeromonas, and Klebsiella spp. (a slime producer). The bacteria are passed from parent to offspring in the cocoon as it is formed. =Nervous system= A leech's nervous system is formed of a few large nerve cells; their large size makes leeches convenient as model organisms for the study of invertebrate nervous systems. The main nerve centre consists of the cerebral ganglion above the gut and another ganglion beneath it, with connecting nerves forming a ring around the pharynx a little way behind the mouth. A nerve cord runs backwards from this in the ventral coelomic channel, with 21 pairs of ganglia in segments six to 26. In segments 27 to 33, other paired ganglia fuse to form the caudal ganglion. Several sensory nerves connect directly to the cerebral ganglion; there are sensory and motor nerve cells connected to the ventral nerve cord ganglia in each segment. Leeches have between two and ten pigment spot ocelli, arranged in pairs towards the front of the body. There are also sensory papillae arranged in a lateral row in one annulation of each segment. Each papilla contains many sensory cells. Some rhynchobdellids have the ability to change colour dramatically by moving pigment in chromatophore cells; this process is under the control of the nervous system but its function is unclear as the change in hue seems unrelated to the colour of the surroundings. Leeches can detect touch, vibration, movement of nearby objects, and chemicals secreted by their hosts; freshwater leeches crawl or swim towards a potential host standing in their pond within a few seconds. Species that feed on warm-blooded hosts move towards warmer objects. Many leeches avoid light, though some blood feeders move towards light when they are ready to feed, presumably increasing the chances of finding a host. =Gas exchange= Leeches live in damp surroundings and in general respire through their body wall. The exception to this is in the Piscicolidae, where branching or leaf-like lateral outgrowths from the body wall form gills. Some rhynchobdellid leeches have an extracellular haemoglobin pigment, but this only provides for about half of the leech's oxygen transportation needs, the rest occurring by diffusion. =Movement= Leeches move using their longitudinal and circular muscles in a modification of the locomotion by peristalsis, self-propulsion by alternately contracting and lengthening parts of the body, seen in other annelids such as earthworms. They use their posterior and anterior suckers (one on each end of the body) to enable them to progress by looping or inching along, in the manner of geometer moth caterpillars. The posterior end is attached to the substrate, and the anterior end is projected forward peristaltically by the circular muscles until it touches down, as far as it can reach, and the anterior end is attached. Then the posterior end is released, pulled forward by the longitudinal muscles, and reattached; then the anterior end is released, and the cycle repeats. Leeches explore their environment with head movements and body waving. The Hirudinidae and Erpobdellidae can swim rapidly with up-and-down or sideways undulations of the body; the Glossiphoniidae in contrast are poor swimmers and curl up and fall to the sediment below when disturbed. File:Leech looping locomotion.jpgalt=Sketches of the looping movement of a leech using its front and back suckersLeeches move by looping using their front and back suckers. File:20100214 Leech climbing door at Lake Leake, Tasmania.ogvalt=Video of looping movementVideo of looping movement Interactions with humans Leeches can be removed by hand, since they do not burrow into the skin or leave the head in the wound. =Bites= Leech bites are generally alarming rather than dangerous, though a small percentage of people have severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions and require urgent medical care. Symptoms of these reactions include red blotches or an itchy rash over the body, swelling around the lips or eyes, a feeling of faintness or dizziness, and difficulty in breathing.Victorian Poisons Information Centre: Leeches Victorian Poisons Information Centre. Retrieved 28 July 2007 An externally attached leech will detach and fall off on its own accord when it is satiated on blood, which may take from twenty minutes to a few hours; bleeding from the wound may continue for some time. Internal attachments, such as inside the nose, are more likely to require medical intervention. Bacteria, viruses, and protozoan parasites from previous blood sources can survive within a leech for months, so leeches could potentially act as vectors of pathogens. Nevertheless, only a few cases of leeches transmitting pathogens to humans have been reported. Leech saliva is commonly believed to contain anaesthetic compounds to numb the bite area, but this has never been proven. Although morphine-like substances have been found in leeches, they have been found in the neural tissues, not the salivary tissues. They are used by the leeches in modulating their own immunocytes and not for anaesthetising bite areas on their hosts. Depending on the species and size, leech bites can be barely noticeable or they can be fairly painful. =In human culture= The leech appears in Proverbs30:15 as an archetype of insatiable greed. More generally, a leech is a persistent social parasite or sycophant. The medicinal leech Hirudo medicinalis, and some other species, have been used for clinical bloodletting for at least 2,500 years: Ayurvedic texts describe their use for bloodletting in ancient India. In ancient Greece, bloodletting was practised according to the theory of humours found in the Hippocratic Corpus of the fifth centuryBC, which maintained that health depended on a balance of the four humours: blood, phlegm, black bile and yellow bile. Bloodletting using leeches enabled physicians to restore balance if they considered blood was present in excess. Pliny the Elder reported in his Natural History that the horse leech could drive elephants mad by climbing up inside their trunks to drink blood. Pliny also noted the medicinal use of leeches in ancient Rome, stating that they were often used for gout, and that patients became addicted to the treatment. In Old English, lǣce was the name for a physician as well as for the animal, though the words had different origins, and lǣcecraft, leechcraft, was the art of healing.

Lithograph by F.-J.-V. Broussais from a cartoon by J. J. Grandville, William Wordsworth's 1802 poem \\"Resolution and Independence\\" describes one of the last of the leech- gatherers, people who travelled Britain catching leeches from the wild, and causing a sharp decline in their abundance, though they remain numerous in Romney Marsh. By 1863, British hospitals had switched to imported leeches, some seven million being imported to hospitals in London that year. In the nineteenth century, demand for leeches was sufficient for hirudiculture, the farming of leeches, to become commercially viable. Leech usage declined with the demise of humoral theory, but made a small-scale comeback in the 1980s after years of decline, with the advent of microsurgery, where venous congestion can arise due to inefficient venous drainage. Leeches can reduce swelling in the tissues and promote healing, helping in particular to restore circulation after microsurgery to reattach body parts. Other clinical applications include varicose veins, muscle cramps, thrombophlebitis, and joint diseases such as epicondylitis and osteoarthritis. Leech secretions contain several bioactive substances with anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant and antimicrobial effects. One active component of leech saliva is a small protein, hirudin. It is widely used as an anticoagulant drug to treat blood- clotting disorders, and manufactured by recombinant DNA technology. In 2012 and 2018, Ida Schnell and colleagues trialled the use of Haemadipsa leeches to gather data on the biodiversity of their mammalian hosts in the tropical rainforest of Vietnam, where it is hard to obtain reliable data on rare and cryptic mammals. They showed that mammal mitochondrial DNA, amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, can be identified from a leech's blood meal for at least four months after feeding. They detected Annamite striped rabbit, small- toothed ferret-badger, Truong Son munjtac, and serow in this way. =Water pollution= Exposure to synthetic estrogen as used in contraceptive medicines, which may enter freshwater ecosystems from municipal wastewater, can affect leeches' reproductive systems. Although not as sensitive to these compounds as fish, leeches showed physiological changes after exposure, including longer sperm sacs and vaginal bulbs, and decreased epididymis weight.

Headquartered in Toronto, the company was founded in 1990 and went public on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 1996 with additional shares being listed on the New York Stock Exchange beginning in 2005. The company formerly owned or had stakes in the Sadiola and Yatela gold mines in Mali, the Mupane gold mine in Botswana, the Niobec niobium mine in Quebec, as well as a royalty in the Diavik Diamond Mine. Operations Entering 2020, Iamgold controlled three productive mines that had combined to produced 762,000 ounces in 2019. In addition, the company owned controlling interest in two developing mines with stakes exploration activities in numerous locations in west Africa, Canada, Nicaragua, Brazil. The company's largest operating mine is located in Burkina Faso. Iamgold subsidiary company Essakane S.A. operates the Essakane gold mine with the Government of Burkina Faso owning a 10% stake. It is an open pit mine, with heap leach processing, along the Gorouol River near the town of Falagountou and the border with Niger. It was acquired by Iamgold in 2009 from Orezone Resources who had conducted exploration and development activities. The mine began commercial production in July 2010. With 3.8 million ounces in proved and probable reserves as of 2020, the mine has produced approximately 350,000-450,000 ounces of gold per year. In Suriname, Iamgold subsidiary company Rosebel Gold Mines N.V. operates the Rosebel gold mine with the Government of Suriname owning a 5% stake. It is an open pit mine located near the town of Brownsweg. Golden Star Resources and Cambior had conducted the exploration and development work to bring the mine into commercial production in 2004. Iamgold acquired Cambior in 2006 while Golden Star sold its stake to Euro Ressources S.A. which Iamgold acquired in 2008. With 2.9 million ounces in proved and probable reserves as of 2020 (with additional reserves in the neighboring Saramacca expansion property and potential for zinc extraction), the mine has produced approximately 300,000 ounces of gold per year. In the Abitibi Municipality of Quebec, Iamgold acquired the Doyon Division mining property with its 2006 acquisition of Cambior. As its older Doyon mine ceased production in 2009, the facilities were re-purposed to support the developing and operation of the new Westwood gold mine which began commercial production in 2014. The ore from the open pit mine is processing at the refurbished Doyon mill using the carbon in pulp method. Zinc deposits. With 1.2 million ounces in proved and probable reserves as of 2020, the mine has produced around 100,000 ounces of gold per year. Iamgold's two developing mines are the Côté Gold project in the Sudbury District of Ontario, and the Boto Gold project in the Kédougou Region of Senegal. The company involvement in the Côté Gold project began in 2012 when it acquired Trelawney Mining and Exploration which held the mineral rights. In 2017, with a preliminary economic assessment estimating a 21-year mine life producing an average of 302,000 ounces of gold annually at an all-in sustaining cost of $686/oz, Iamgold sold a 30% stake in Côté Gold to Sumitomo Metal Mining. A feasibility study completed the next year estimated the open pit mine would require an initial capital cost of $1.15 billion and adjusted the estimated production numbers to 367,000 ounces of gold annually over 16 year life span. Meanwhile, feasibility studies for the Senegalese Boto Gold project estimated a potential for approximately 160,000 ounces of gold annually over 11-year mine life. Corporate history The Iamgold International African Mining Gold Corporation (re-named Iamgold Corporation in 1997) was founded on March 27, 1990, by businessmen Mark Nathanson and William Pugliese to pursue a mining concession being offered in Mali. Headquartered in Markham, Ontario, the company partnered with South African gold mining company Anglo American's AngloGold Ashanti to develop the Sadiola Gold Mine. To fund this, Iamgold raised $60 million in an initial public offering becoming a publicly-listed company on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 1996, with an additional $13 million worth of shares being issued the following year. With the success of developing the Sadiola Gold Mine, Iamgold and AngloGold Ashanti developed a second mine, the Yatela Mine, which began production in 2001. With profits now being realized, Iamgold was listed on the TSE 300 index and began issuing dividends to shareholders, uniquely the dividends were aid in bullion instead of cash. Additional shares were issued in 2002 and they company became listed on the American Stock Exchange. The company incurred a court-ordered $1.7 million fine, payable to Kinbauri Gold for withdrawing from a merger agreement. Also in late-2002, in a $218 million in all-stock deal, Iamgold acquired royalty company Repadre Capital Corp. which had stakes in several gold and diamond mines in Canada and Africa, most significant of which was a 19% interest in Gold Fields's Tarkwa and Damang mines in Ghana. With Repadre's Joseph Conway taking over as CEO of the combined company, the merger boosted Iamgold's attributable gold production to 421,000 ounces from 290,000 ounces the year before. After moving its headquarters from Markham to Toronto, the directors and CEOs of Iamgold and Wheaton River Minerals Ltd. agreed to a merger deal that would create a new company to be called Axiom Gold, valued at about $2.9 billion in 2004. However Iamgold stakeholders fought the proposal. BMO Nesbitt Burns and CIBC World Markets organized competing offers, Golden Star Resources Ltd. to acquire Iamgold for $1.2-billion and Coeur d'Alene Mines Corp. to acquire Wheaton River for $2.56 billion, whose rejection by the Iamgold and Wheaton River board of directors was fought in court. While the shareholder votes were delayed due to the court cases, Wheaton River shareholders voted in favour of the merger but Iamgold shareholders rejected it. The company subsequently made a failed bid to acquire assets of Gold Fields. With the failed merger and acquisition behind them, in the next two years the company acquired Australian company Gallery Gold and its Mupane gold mine in Botswana in an $235 million all-stock deal, and Cambior with its Rosebel mine in Suriname, a Niobium mine in Quebec and several older Quebec gold mines in a $1.2 billion deal. With 100% interest in the Mupane, Doyon & Mouska, Sleeping Giant and Niobec mines, as well as a 95% interest in the Rosebel mine, the mergers transitioned the company from an investor into an operator and increased their attributable gold production from 642,000 ounces in 2006 to 965,000 ounces in 2007, and peaking at 997,000 ounces in 2008. The company fared well during the 2008 recession with its stock falling from $8 per share at the beginning of the year to bottoming out at $4 in October and peaking again at $20 by November 2009. They sold off numerous non-core assets, such as royalties acquired from Repadre, the La Arena copper project in Peru acquired from Cambior, and closed the Sleeping Giant (selling the mill and remaining property), and Doyon mines. In the same timeframe, they initiated plans to develop the Westwood mine using the Doyon property and acquired Orezone Resources Inc. and its Essakane Project in Burkina Faso. While 2008 proved to be their best year in terms of gold production, the company's stock price peaked in 2011 at $21.40. After CEO Joseph Conway stepped down in January 2010, replaced by interim CEO Peter Jones until Enbridge executive Stephen Letwin was hired, the Essakane mine had commenced production in July 2010. In June 2011, Iamgold sold its 19% stake in the Tarkwa and Damang gold mines in Ghana to Gold Fields Limited for $667 million and its Mupane gold mine in Botswana to Galane Gold Ltd. for $34 million. In 2012, in a $608-million purchase, Iamgold acquired Trelawney Mining and Exploration and its Côté Lake gold deposit, near Sudbury, Ontario which they believed could be developed into a significant mine; although a 30% stake had to be sold to Sumitomo Metal Mining to help fund its development. While the sales also helped finance the expansion of Essakane and the development of the Westwood mine, production would peak again at 882,000 ounces in 2017 and 2018, before falling to 762,000 ounces in 2019 as the Yatela mine became exhausted and Sadiola mine was sold in December 2019. Looking towards future projects, Iamgold purchased Merrex Gold and its Siribaya-Diakha exploration property in Mali. =Past mines (divested and closed)= Since opening the Sadiola Gold Mine in 1996, Iamgold has held stakes or outright owned numerous mines that later sold or ceased operation. * The Sadiola Gold Mine in Mali was operated by joint-venture partner AngloGold Ashanti, each with a 41% working interest.

Dowdall publicly avowed that he rejected the supremacy of Elizabeth I of England, and only recognized that of the Pope. The earl forwarded the examination to Sir Robert Cecil, and had Dowdall committed to Exeter jail. Whilst in prison he was tortured and put to the rack, but continued unchanged in his Catholicism. On 18 June 1599, the Earl of Bath wrote to Sir Robert Cecil for instructions in regard to James Dowdall, who had been detained in prison almost a year. Accordingly, he was tried at the Exeter assizes, and was ordered to be hanged, drawn, and quartered.

While his work as a conductor left him little time to compose, the last 17 years of his life were devoted to writing music.Corneel Mertens and Diana von Volborth-Danys., Sternefeld, Daniel on Grove Music Online Style In his writings, a clear evolution can be traced from a late romantic musical language, by way of the chromaticism of Wagner and the sonority of Mahler and Richard Strauss, to lyrical expressionism. One of his most admired composers was Igor Stravinsky.

American Tobacco Company, , was a decision by the United States Supreme Court, which held that the combination in this case is one in restraint of trade and an attempt to monopolize the business of tobacco in interstate commerce within the prohibitions of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. As a result, the American Tobacco Company was split into 4 competitors. FactsJudgment The Sherman Antitrust Act was created in 1890, and in 1907 the American Tobacco Company was indicted in violation of it.Brandt, Alan M.: The Cigarette Century: The Rise, Fall, and Deadly Persistence of the Product that Defined America, p. 39. Basic Books, 2007 In 1908 when the Department of Justice filed suit against the company, sixty-five companies and twenty-nine individuals were named in the suit. The Supreme Court ordered the company to dissolve in 1911 on the same day that it ordered the Standard Oil Trust to dissolve. The ruling in United States v. American Tobacco Co. stated that the combination of the tobacco companies “in and of itself, as well as each and all of the elements composing it whether corporate or individual, whether considered collectively or separately [was] in restraint of trade and an attempt to monopolize, and a monopolization within the first and second sections of the Anti-Trust Act.”Jenkins, John Wilber: James B. Duke: Master Builder, p. 153. George H. Doran Company, 1927. Significance In order to promote market competition, four firms were created from the American Tobacco Company's assets: American Tobacco Company, R. J. Reynolds, Liggett & Myers, and Lorillard. The monopoly became an oligopoly. In 1938 Thurman Arnold in the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division began hosting hearings in the Temporary National Economic Committee to determine whether the four companies were further engaged together in monopolistic practices. , citing That committee found that 3 of the 4 companies were guilty of the charges presented to the court.

Soon after, he entered the company of Wanda Osiris, the undisputed queen of the revue of that time in Italy. Between the two wars he became in a short time one of the most popular comedians of the revue theater. Macario made his film debut in 1933 with Aria di paese but the success came just six years later with two comedy films directed by Mario Mattoli and co-written by a young Federico Fellini, Imputato alzatevi! and Lo vedi come sei... lo vedi come sei?. After a series of successful comedies directed by Carlo Borghesio since the early fifties Macario appeared in short characterizations in anthology films and was sidekick of Totò in a number of films.

The choir's music repertoire varied from sacred to popular, early to contemporary. It disbanded in 2018, with most of its choristers remaining in the newly-formed St. Monica Vocal Ensemble. History The choir was founded in 1964 by Sr Beniamina Portelli. For over 20 years, it collaborated with other entities, exchanging visits with foreign choirs and travelling to European countries. The choir presented concerts at the Liverpool Philharmonic Theatre, the Vatican City, St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna, Esztergom Cathedral in Hungary and St Mary's Cathedral in Edinburgh, as well as televised and radio recordings for renowned media stations such as the BBC and the ARD. Its collaboration with foreign choirs included the Knox Academy Choir from Scotland and the Beethoven Society of Australia. With the latter, the St Monica Choir presented a production of Beethoven's 9th Symphony with Orkestra Nazzjonali under the baton of Dr Steve Watson at the Teatru Manoel in May 1999. The St Monica Choir was also commissioned to premiere local compositions, such as Stabat Mater by prolific Maltese composer Carmelo Pace together with Orkestra Nazzjonali (the national orchestra) and Mro Michael Laus. Early 2007 saw yet another collaboration come to fruition, this time together with Vocalise, when, for the first time in Malta, Johann Sebastian Bach's Christmas Oratorio Parts I, II & III were performed at St John's Co-Cathedral under the direction of international conductor and musicologist Hans Jürgen Nagel. In November 1999, the St Monica Choir became the first Maltese choir to win the Malta International Choir Festival. Delegated to represent Malta during the first edition of the choral Olympics held in Linz, Austria in 2000, the choir was awarded bronze from amongst over twenty participants in the mixed choirs’ category. In 2002, the choir was invited to make a guest appearance during a choral festival at the Dorog House of Culture in Hungary. Two years later, the choir was once again invited to participate in the “XIII Festival de Musica en Navidad” organized by the Cultural Department of Madrid. The St Monica Choir, the only foreign choir invited to participate, held its concert at the Sagrada Familia church in Madrid. In 2004, to commemorate the 40th Anniversary of its foundation, the choir launched a comprehensive website and a documentary on DVD encompassing forty years of existence and achievements. The choir's own productions of its Easter and Christmas concerts helped raise funds for various religious missions. In 2006, the St Monica Choir performed a concert in Haddington, Scotland to help raise funds for the local church there. The choir was an affiliated member of Förderverein Interkultur, organizers of the Choir Olympics and other Musica Mundi concerts worldwide. The Augustinian sisters were unable to continue with their commitments towards the Choir in late 2018, and the choir was disbanded. A majority of the choristers now form part of the St. Monica Vocal Ensemble. Founder and Director Hailing from the city of Vittoriosa, Sr Beniamina Portelli, baptized Marion, is the eldest of 5 daughters and a son born to Carmelo and Ines née Calleja. The Portelli family took refuge in Siggiewi during the Second World War. Portelli started her religious life with the Augustinian nuns at the age of sixteen. She took up piano lessons at the age of five, pursued her studies with Sr Teresina Saliba and conducted her finals and LRSM under the guidance of Ms Bascetta. Portelli attended various courses both in Malta and abroad. Of note were here trips to the Vatican City in connection with choral singing (1953); Derbyshire regarding professional music teaching (1964); Harrogate for choral direction (1983); the London Royal Schools of Music with Mr A Kelly (1985); Edinburgh and London with EPTA (1993) and an LLCM for choral direction for which she was awarded the Society of Music Medal, having been the first successful candidate worldwide. In the early 1950s, Portelli spent a year teaching music in Rome. On her return to Malta, she took up music teaching and broadened her students’ horizons by encouraging their involvement in a wider musical spectrum. She organized end-of-year concerts to encourage students to experience different dimensions of music, such as dancing and choral singing. She also the set up an accordion band. In September 2000, the Mosta Local Council conferred upon Portelli “Gieh il-Mosta”, and in November 2000, she was awarded the Society Music Medal by the Council of Arts, Manufacture and Commerce. On 13 December 2003 at the Grandmaster's Palace in Valletta, the then President of the Republic Guido de Marco, awarded Portelli the Midalja għall-Qadi tar- Repubblika in appreciation of her efforts to promote music and the establishment of the St Monica Choir. Portelli has had a number of students, such as composer Ray Agius, virtuoso pianists Mark Darnford and Stefan Cassar who also teaches music in France, John Attard who teaches music in Austria and Fr Aurelio Mule’ Stagno who obtained a distinction in all his examinations and is presently studying abroad. Others include Claire Massa, Simone Attard and Maureen Galea who graduated from the University of Malta. Administration The administrative committee was elected by the choristers for a two-year term and chaired by Portelli. Voice-leaders sub-committee were headed by a coordinator acting in close liaison with the committee. Leaders from each voice-section were selected by Portelli in consultation with the coordinator and the committee president. Awards and achievements=The 11th Malta International Choir Festival= St Monica Choir participated in the 11th Malta International Choir Festival in November 1999. The final night was held on 12 November 1999 at the Mediterranean Conference Centre.

Boswell Ranch, considered a historical location of Wyoming today. He also helped to settle Laramie, Wyoming. Impact on Laramie, Wyoming, Steve Long lynching Boswell ventured into Wyoming Territory around 1865 towards the end of the American Civil War. He is believed to have served in the Union Army, but it is not certain as to from which state he originated, although it is believed he may have come from New Jersey. Boswell arrived in the area of present-day Laramie, Wyoming, as one of its first settlers. He was joined there by his brother George Boswell and his family. At the time, that area was extremely rough and wild, with numerous outlaws drawn to it due to the lack of law enforcement. Three of those would be early western gunman \\"Big\\" Steve Long, and his half brothers Ace and Con Moyer. Long would become the Marshal of Laramie, whereas Boswell would be the first Sheriff of Albany County, Wyoming, where Laramie is located. Almost immediately the two lawmen were at odds. Boswell was an original member of the local \\"Vigilance Committee\\", organized to help bring order to the lawless area. Long and his brothers, however, opened a saloon called the Bucket of Blood, and began strong arming settlers into signing away their property. If they refused, they were more times than not killed. At times, Long would goad them into a fight and shoot them down, at others they were merely killed under mysterious circumstances. In May 1868, Melville C. Brown was elected mayor, but he soon resigned due to the incompetence of city's other officials.Frontier Index. 16 June 1868. By October 1868, Long had killed thirteen men in gunfights, and several others were suspected to have been killed by him, but only those thirteen are confirmed to have died from his hand. Boswell organized the citizens, and suggested they wait, and eventually Long would put himself in a position to where they could act against him. On October 18, 1868 Long attempted to rob a prospector named Rollie \\"Hard Luck\\" Harrison. Harrison produced a pistol, and a gunfight erupted between the two. Long was wounded and retreated. Harrison was killed, dying as a result of his wounds before he was able to relay who shot him to anyone else. Long confessed to his fiancé how he was wounded, and she in turn told Sheriff Boswell. Boswell organized several men in the town, and they entered the saloon owned by Long and his brothers on October 28. The mob overwhelmed the three and led them to an unfinished cabin in town. Long was quiet throughout the process, having only one request, that he be allowed to remove his boots, stating \\"My mother always said I'd die with my boots on\\". Barefoot, he was lynched along with Con and Ace Moyer by hanging them from the rafters of the cabin. There were no legal actions taken against the members of the lynch mob. Later life By this time, Boswell's ranch had become one of the largest and most productive in the territory. One of his fellow lynching vigilantes, L. P. Griswold, moved to Denver, Colorado. He formed a \\"Vigilance Committee\\" there in 1872, but was arrested for doing so. Believing he stood no chance if brought to trial, he escaped, and was shot and killed while doing so. Boswell, however, continued to be a prominent figure in Wyoming. In 1872, Boswell served as the first warden of the Wyoming Territorial Prison. He died of unknown causes in 1921. His ranch in Wyoming is now listed on the National Register of Historical Places. ReferencesExternal links *Cattlemans Commonwealth of the Western Range *Hal Mansfield Writings, N. K.

Hedsor Water was once the main navigation of the Thames but was by-passed by the construction of Cookham Lock in 1830. Navigation is only possible for the first from the downstream end, where a few temporary moorings are available, except for smaller boats. Cookham Lock opened in 1830, but no weir was built at this time. In 1832 Lord Boston of Hedsor House claimed compensation for loss of towpath rights along Hedsor Water which he was granted. In 1837 a weir was found necessary and built across Hedsor Water, leading to further litigation from Lord Boston for loss of trade to the wharf he owned there. Hedsor Wharf, on the upper reach of Hedsor Water had been an important trading post. The paper made at nearby Cookham Paper Mill was shipped from there and the stone used to build Shardeloes was brought from Oxford to Hedsor Wharf. This time the only compensation he received was the building of a flash lock in the weir. This was removed when the lock was rebuilt in 1869, as Lord Boston had built eel bucks in the stream in the meantime.Fred. S.

It was the culmination of a year of feuding between Clan MacLeod of Dunvegan and the Clan MacDonald of Sleat, that ended with a MacDonald victory in Coire na Creiche on the northern slopes of the Cuillin hills. It was the last clan battle in Skye. Background The Macleod and MacDonald Clans had been long at feud. Rory Mòr MacLeod (Ruaraidh MacLeòid) attempted to make peace, offering the hand of his sister, Margaret Macleod, in marriage to Donald Gorm Mòr MacDonald (Dòmhnall Gorm Mòr MacDhòmhnall). The marriage itself was subject to a contract called a handfast. In a handfast arrangement, a man and woman lived together as man and wife for up to a year and a day. If, during this period, the woman bore a male child to be heir, then marriage would result. If not, then both parties returned to their respective families. After a year and a day, Margaret MacLeod had not borne a child, male or female. Furthermore, at some point during this year, she had lost the sight in one eye. Donald MacDonald, having no further use for Margaret MacLeod, decided to send her back to her brother. He tied her, facing backwards, onto a one-eyed horse, led by a one-eyed servant and followed by a one-eyed mongrel dog, and sent all four back to Dunvegan Castle. Rory MacLeod, incensed by the insult to his sister, and ultimately to himself and his clan, once again declared war on the clan MacDonald. He devastated the Trotternish peninsula in the north of Skye, which prompted MacDonald to attack MacLeod land in Harris. These battles became known as the Wars of the One-Eyed Woman. Carinish MacLeod responded with a raid on North Uist, sending 40 men under his cousin Donald Glas MacLeod to seize goods that the locals had put for safety in the Trinity Temple at Carinish. As the raiders ate breakfast in the church, they were surprised by twelve MacDonalds led by Donald MacIain 'ic Sheumais (Donald, son of John, son of James) of Clan Ranald, who led the MacLeods into an ambush. Only two MacLeods survived the Battle of Carinish; Donald MacLeod was among the dead. On his way back to Skye to report his victory, a storm forced Donald MacIain 'ic Sheumais to seek shelter at Rodel in Harris. He was entertained there by Rory MacLeod, even after Rory learned the identity of his guests. However the MacDonalds wisely left secretly during the night; before dawn, MacLeod clansmen set fire to their quarters without the knowledge of their chief. The final battle at Coire na Creiche The feud continued to escalate, causing much suffering among the people. MacDonald decided to end it with a decisive battle. When Rory MacLeod went to seek the assistance of Archibald Campbell, 7th Earl of Argyll, MacDonald took the opportunity to launch an all- out invasion of northern Skye. The cattle seized in this attack were driven south to a traditional refuge for raiders, the Coire na Creiche () overlooking Glen Brittle below Bruach na Frìthe. Here the MacLeod forces led by Rory's brother Alasdair caught up with the MacDonalds. They joined battle late in the day and continued well into the night. The MacLeods were utterly defeated, with the capture of Alasdair MacLeod and 30 of his kinsmen. Aftermath The Privy Council now intervened to end the feud. MacDonald was ordered to surrender himself to George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly, and Rory MacLeod was to surrender to the Earl of Argyll. MacDonald agreed to release his prisoners, and the end of the feud was celebrated with three weeks of feasting and festivities at Dunvegan Castle. Aside from a brief flare-up in 1603, that was the end of violence between the two clans. In popular culture The events are the subject of a comic folk song by Glasgow folk singer Matt McGinn. The song is called The One-Eyed Woman. Also referenced in Season 1, Episode 3 of the Amazon series Good Omens.

In June 1947 it was equipped with Spitfires Mk IX and XVI, which were retained until October 1953, when the squadron, now based at Elefsis, was equipped with jet aircraft: the US-made F-84 Thunderjet fighter-bombers and RT-33A reconnaissance aircraft. The redesignated 335th Fighter-Bomber Squadron (335 Μοίρα Διώξεως-Βομβαρδισμού) came under the 111th Combat Wing at Nea Anchialos until September 1957, when it redeployed to 110th Combat Wing at Larissa, where it was equipped with F-84F jets. In November 1960, the squadron was transferred to Tanagra and assigned to ground strike duties as the 335th Strike Squadron (335 Μοίρα Κρούσης), where it remained until its transfer to Araxos in June 1977. In May 1965 the squadron was equipped with the F-104G, and would continue flying the Starfighters until May 1992. In December 1987 the squadron received 10 RF-104 aircraft and formed a separate Photoreconnaissance Flight. These aircraft remained in service until the type was decommissioned in May 1992. On 3 April 1993, the squadron was established as the 335th Bomber Squadron (335 Μοίρα Βομβαρδισμού), flying the A-7H Corsair, from a batch of 62 aircraft handed over by the US Air Force as surplus following the First Gulf War. The squadron operated the aircraft until 2008, when it began receiving new F-16 Block 52+ Advanced aircraft. Converted to a multirole squadron, it became operational with the type in February 2010.

It is the official Arabic- localised variant of Nickelodeon and until 2011, it was the last remaining channel to retain the 'splat' logo that was used from 1984 to 2009 in the United States. History It was the second channel in the joint venture between Viacom International Media Networks and Arabian Television Network, part of Arab Media Group, the largest media group in the United Arab Emirates, after the successful launch for MTV Arabia (later known as MTV Middle East). The website was nickarabia.com. As of 2011, it was currently the only Nickelodeon channel worldwide that had not changed its logo from the orange splat to the orange text after the mother company's 2009 rebrand. Since late 2010, the channel had been suffering a frozen broadcast, broadcasting its usual programmes repetitively without any evidence of upcoming updates. Its official website went down, and there were no clear indications or citations for why the channel was being heavily neglected, albeit oddly remaining live for the time being. Regardless, the channel remained live for many months into 2011. A similar situation was happening with its sister channel MTV Arabia. On 8 September 2011, at one minute past midnight in U.A.E. time, and without a mainstream warning, the channel closed and went on an indefinite hiatus without any explanation. The broadcast signal initially displayed nothing but a static message indicating Nickelodeon Arabia's viewers to continue watching Nickelodeon programmes via the Nickelodeon block on MBC 3. The signal then reverted to a casual test card a few days later , and the channel was de- listed by various satellite television providers. , the signal itself disappeared completely.http://en.kingofsat.net/channelhistory.php?ch=6495 On 17 December 2014, it was announced that Viacom International Media Networks would launch a related feed of Nickelodeon Arabia (also in HD) on the Dubai- based pay-TV service OSN, along with a Nick Jr. channel. Both channels launched on 5 January 2015 in Arabic only, but later launched an additional English audio track in February 2015. A dedicated Nickelodeon website, social media accounts and an exclusive Nick app were launched.

The live-action TeenNick shows originally aired in English with Arabic subtitles. However, original social shows produced by Nickelodeon Arabia's own studio, such as Shoof Kids and Jamaatna, were also in Arabic. Most of the network shows were outdated, older series at the time that have already been cancelled or have ended before their debut, with the exception of SpongeBob SquarePants, although they are considered fairly never-before-seen by most of the Arab audience at one time, in either their English or Arabic formats. There were even several series yet to debut on Nickelodeon Arabia, with exception of The Fairly OddParents, which apparently already settled on Disney Channel Arabia in 2006, and settled on Nicktoons Arabia years later in 2017. Although Fairly OddParents characters did appear in activity segments from Nickelodeon Magazine cutouts. Like most Arab channels, Nickelodeon did feature censorship, but this is by far limited to simply scenes of French kissing, although any mention of said kisses are retained.

Ladeuzeplein is a square (plein is Dutch for square) in the center of Leuven (.). The square was named after a former rector of the Catholic University of Louvain, Monseigneur Paulin Ladeuze. The Ladeuzeplein is the largest square in Leuven. Until World War II it was called the Volksplaats or People's Place. Among the local population the square was known as the Jerkarlisse. This name is derived from the Clarisse religious order who used to have a monastery at this location, when it still was a sandy hill (Jer refers in the local dialect to dirt, thus unpaved, as contrary to the adjacent Stiënkarlisse, the former paved Graanmarkt, now Herbert Hooverplein). In 1783 the monastery was abolished and the city of Leuven bought the estate from the Belgian authorities, who had inherited it, in order to establish a market dedicated to the sale of wood. The hill was leveled off and the first house on the square was erected in 1812. At this time the square was named Place Napoleon, later it was renamed the Volksplaats and eventually it became the Mgr. Ladeuzeplein.  University Library  The square is dominated visually by the monumental library of the University. Even though the neo-Renaissance exterior implies otherwise, the building is relatively recent, dating from 1921. The library was a gift from the American people to the city of Leuven, after the original 17th-century library near the Grote Markt was burned down by the German occupying forces in August 1914. The fire destroyed not only a large part of the cultural patrimony of the medieval city, but it also caused the loss of countless and irreplaceable historical manuscripts and books, many dating back centuries. This act of violence caused uproar throughout the world and several, mostly American, charities were established to compensate the loss, so in 1921 work was begun to build a new library, on the square now known as Ladeuzeplein. The new building also contains one of the largest carillons in Europe, it was created and offered as a gift in 1928, by US engineers as a monument of remembrance for all colleagues who lost their lives during World War I. The carillon originally contained 48 bells, that being the number of states in the Union at the time of the gift. The main bell, which rings every hour on the hour, is named the Liberty Bell of Louvain and the fourth largest bell contains an inscription calling for world peace. In May 1940, in the first year of World War II, the German occupiers again destroyed, almost completely, the (new) University Library. After the war the building was reconstructed almost completely along the original plans. After a substantial renovation from 1999 to 2003 the exterior, carillon and roof structure are once again restored to their former beauty and dominate views of the square. In January 2014 a permanent exhibit on these wartime events was installed over five floors of the bell tower.  Art  In 2005 the Katholieke Universiteit te Leuven celebrated the 575th anniversary of the foundation of the Old University of Leuven, and decided to thank the city of Leuven for its hospitality by asking renowned artist Jan Fabre to create a fitting sculpture and present it as a gift to the city. Fabre designed a modern art installation called the Totem. It consists of a huge Thai jewel beetle stuck on a high steel needle. According to the author, the juxtaposition of the surreal view of the bug on a needle in front of the neo-classical library building perfectly captures the spirit of the city and university of Leuven. The ancient art of citywide musical recitals also still is very much alive. There are regular recitals carried out on the carillon, which was completely restored in 1983 and expanded to 63 bells.

Characteristics The lyretails have an oblong shaped body which has a depth that is less than the length of the head and which has a standard length that is 2.8 to 3.2 times its depth. They have a slightly convex dorsal profile of the head and a snout which is longer than the diameter of the eye. Both species have a rounded preopercle with a finely serrated margin and a fleshy lower margin. There are three flat spines on the gill cover which has a straight upper margin. Both the upper and lower jaws have a pair of large canine teeth at the front and there are also 1 to 3 large canines in the middle of the lower jaw There are teeth on the roof of the mouth.

He kept his ideas to himself for over 12 years, concerned that he might be ridiculed and also because he did not have the funds to build such a vessel. A friend convinced him that his idea must be brought to life, and that sufficient funds could be found from friends and the general public.

In September 1857 he returned to Barcelona, where he organized the first commercial society in Spain dedicated to submarine navigation, Monturiol, Font, Altadill y Cia. with a capital of 10,000 pesetas. In 1858 he presented his project in a scientific thesis titled \\"El Ictíneo o barco-pez\\", (The Ictíneo or fish-ship). On 28 June 1859, Monturiol was ready for the Ictíneo's first voyage and the submarine was launched into Barcelona harbour. Unfortunately, she hit some underwater pilings, which Monturiol estimated would exhaust his funds to properly repair. He performed some hasty repairs on the damaged portholes, exterior hull, and ballast tanks, and limited his diving depth to . During the summer of 1859 Monturiol performed more than 20 test dives in the Ictíneo, with his business partner and shipbuilder as crew. He gradually increased the depth he dived to until he reached his limit and learned that the crew could remain dived for about 2 hours using only the oxygen sealed inside the pressure hull, and that their endurance could be doubled using compressed oxygen and his carbon dioxide scrubber. The Ictíneo turned out to possess good handling, but its top speed was disappointing, powered as it was by human muscle power. Ictíneo I was eventually destroyed in January 1862 after some 50 dives, when a cargo vessel ran into it while it was berthed. It was succeeded by the much improved Ictíneo II. A modern replica of the Ictíneo I stands in the garden entrance to the Marine Museum in Barcelona. Description Monturiol realized that the ideal shape for a submarine from the point of view of hydrodynamics and steerage was that of a fish. However, the optimum shape for a hull to withstand water pressure was a sphere. He therefore combined the two, with an inner, ellipsoidal pressure hull and an outer, streamlined, fish-shaped hull, inventing what is now called a light hull, with a space between the two hulls which was open to the sea and free-flooding. Monturiol had originally wanted to build his pressure hull out of metal in the interests of strength but he and his financial backers lacked sufficient funds, so he instead settled for wood, with which he was familiar since his father was a cooper. The pressure hull was constructed from olive wood, supported with oak rings, and covered in 2 mm of copper, and measured long, at its highest, and wide. Monturiol calculated that it should be able to maintain its integrity to a depth of , although he only rated it to for the sake of safety. The outer streamlined hull was long, high, and displaced 10 tonnes. Several thick glass ports were installed on the sides, top, and bow of the Ictíneo; these were semi-conical in shape so that water pressure would tend to force them more firmly into their seats and so avoid leaks. Four ballast tanks (or bladders, as he called them) were installed in the free-flooding area between the submarine's two hulls, two located forward and two towards the rear, all controlled from inside the pressure hull using valves to admit water and pumps to force in air. An emergency system was fitted to ensure that the submarine could surface even if the ballast tank system failed, consisting of two sets of large weights fitted to the exterior which could be jettisoned to give the vessel positive buoyancy. Monturiol also included a large weight mounted inside the submarine on a longitudinal metal track, which could be moved back and forth to counteract shifts in the vessel's centre of gravity. For propulsion, Monturiol used hand-cranked propellers. He invented a chemical air scrubber to remove carbon dioxide from the interior by forcing the air through a container of calcium hydroxide, thus allowing the vessel to remain underwater for longer periods. He also devised a method of producing oxygen which unfortunately proved impractical because it also produced sulfuric acid as a byproduct. For interior illumination he used a simple candle, which had the advantage of turning red when oxygen was beginning to run low and so alerted the crew.

An earlier tavern in Southwark used the same name, and an inn of the name in Whitechapel was used as a theatre. A number of other taverns and inns have since used the name, typically with reference to Shakespeare. In London=Eastcheap= The Boar's Head Tavern on Eastcheap is featured in historical plays by Shakespeare, particularly Henry IV, Part 1, as a favourite resort of the fictional character Falstaff and his friends in the early 15th century. The landlady is Mistress Quickly. It was the subject of essays by Oliver Goldsmith and Washington Irving. Though there is no evidence of a Boar's Head inn existing at the time the play is set, Shakespeare was referring to a real inn that existed in his own day. Established before 1537, but destroyed in 1666 in the Great Fire of London, it was soon rebuilt and continued operation until some point in the late 18th century, when the building was used by retail outlets. What remained of the building was demolished in 1831.Henry C. Shelley, Inns and Taverns of Old London, Boston, L.C. Page, 1909, p.21. The boar's head sign was kept, and is now installed in the Shakespeare's Globe theatre.Asbury, Nick, White Hart Red Lion: The England of Shakespeare's Histories, Oberon, 2013, p.52. The site of the original inn is now part of the approach to London Bridge in Cannon Street. Near the site on modern Eastcheap, architect Robert Lewis Roumieu created a neo-Gothic building in 1868; this makes references to the Boar's Head Inn in its design and exterior decorations, which include a boar's head peeping out from grass, and portrait heads of Henry IV and Henry V. Roumieu's building originally functioned as a vinegar warehouse, though it has since been converted into offices.Crawford, David, The City of London: its architectural heritage: the book of the City of London's heritage walks, Woodhead-Faulkner, 1976, p.56. Nicholas Pevsner described it as \\"one of the maddest displays in London of gabled Gothic brick.\\" Ian Nairn called it \\"the scream you wake on at the end of a nightmare.\\"Christopher Hibbert et al, The London Encyclopedia, Macmillan, 2011, p.263. =Others= There was another Boar's Head Inn, at Whitechapel, the courtyard of which was used from 1557 onwards as an inn-yard theatre to stage plays, known as the Boar's Head Theatre. It was refurbished in 1598–1599.Herbert Berry, The Boar's Head Playhouse, Associated University Presses, 986, pp.81 ff. There was yet another Boar's Head Inn, at Southwark, owned by Sir John Fastolf, who is the source for the character-name of Falstaff.Wm. E. Baumgaertner, Squires, Knights, Barons, Kings: War and Politics in Fifteenth Century England, Trafford Publishing, 2010, chapter \\"Sir John Fastolf\\". While the Eastcheap Boar's Head Inn is not known to have existed during the reign of Henry IV, this inn may have. Other Boar's Head establishments The Boar's Head Inn in Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, England, is a historic building dating to the 16th or 17th century. The Boar's Head Inn may also refer to the Boar's Head Resort of Charlottesville, Virginia, aka \\"Boar's Head Inn\\", a hotel and resort located in Charlottesville, Virginia. Owned by the University of Virginia, it was likely named after the London establishments. There is also a Boar's Head Pub located at 161 Ontario Street, in Stratford, Ontario, Canada. Stratford is noted for its long-running annual Shakespeare Festival and its Shakespeare-themed street names, restaurants, hotels and craft shops.

History The Ictíneo II was originally intended as an improved version of the handpowered Ictíneo I. The Spanish Navy pledged support to Monturiol but did not actually supply it, so he had to raise funds himself, writing a letter to the nation to encourage a popular subscription which raised 300,000 pesetas from citizens of Spain and was used to form the company La Navegación Submarina to develop the Ictíneo II. The Ictíneo II made her maiden voyage under human power on 20 May 1865, submerging to . A few months later, Monturiol attempted to attract government funding by installing a cannon that could be aimed and fired from inside the submarine. After reading about the American Civil War and the attempts at submarine construction such as the CSS Hunley, the financially desperate Monturiol wrote to the US Secretary of the Navy; however, the Civil War had ended by the time the Secretary responded. Dissatisfied with the limitations placed on him by human propulsion, Monturiol realized that the only option was steam power, but contemporary steam engines required a fire which was not an option for a submarine. To this end he invented an air independent engine, which ran on a chemical reaction that provided its own oxygen for combustion. Monturiol envisaged a new vessel, custom built to house his new engine, which would be entirely built of metal with the engine housed in its own separate compartment. However, due to the state of his finances, construction of a new vessel was out of the question, and instead he managed to assemble enough funds to fit the engine into the Ictíneo II. On 22 October 1867 the Ictíneo II made its first surface journey under steam power, averaging with a top speed of . Two months later, on 14 December, Monturiol submerged the vessel and ran his chemical engine, but without attempting to travel anywhere. On 23 December, La Navegación Submarina went bankrupt, having completely exhausted its funds. Monturiol had spent 100,000 Duros — which could have purchased several frigates, or of gold — and could attract no more investment. The chief creditor called in his debt, and Monturiol was forced to surrender the Ictíneo II, which was his sole asset. The creditor subsequently sold it on to a businessman, and the authorities, who taxed all ships, issued its new owner with a tax bill. Rather than pay, he dismantled the entire submarine and sold it for scrap. The ship's surface motor was removed to a textile factory; the viewports ended up as bathroom windows.Cindy Lee Van Dover. A Utopian's Submarine. Retrieved on 2008-08-01 Description Plan of Ictíneo II Ictíneo II close up of replica at the harbour of Barcelona. The Ictíneo II was long, wide, and high. Her displacement was 46 tonnes and her interior volume was . She was built of olive wood with oak reinforcements, and a 2 mm thick layer of copper. Her upper side had a deck wide and a hatch with three glazed portholes in diameter and thick glass blocks. The submarine could be steered from the conning tower by means of an endless screw gear. Four ballast tanks of capacity were located symmetrically on each side in the free flooding areas between the streamlined outer light hull and the inner pressure hull. The ballast tanks would be flooded at will to submerge and surfacing was achieved by forcing air into them with a pump. Pitch during diving was controlled by a weight which could be moved longitudinally along a rail, remotely controlled by the helmsman. The submarine also had an emergency mechanism intended to jettison the ballast to allow it to surface quickly. The most important innovation in the Ictíneo II was its air independent propulsion for underwater navigation. A reaction of zinc, manganese dioxide and potassium chlorate heated the boiler of a steam engine to provide propulsion and illumination and the oxygen released by the reaction could be used for breathing. Monturiol purchased a six-cylinder steam engine and divided it in half; one half was powered by a coal-burning boiler for surface propulsion while the other half was powered by a separate boiler heated by his chemical mixture.

History Founded in 1914 with eight students, the school originally operated out of a number of army surplus tents on the university grounds, then moved to a bicycle shed before finally settling in a newly built wooden building. The next journalism building was completed in 1936. In June 2007, the journalism program relocated again to the newly constructed Don Anderson Hall. Studies The j-school offers both undergraduate and graduate level studies in five main areas: *print reporting and editing *broadcast reporting and editing *photojournalism *Radio-TV production *Master's in Environmental Science and Natural Resource Journalism The program is accredited and is in partnership with the Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communications. Graduate Program The University of Montana's Master's program in Environmental Science and Natural Resource Journalism was created in 2010. The program was announced less than a month after Columbia University, in New York City, suspended their Earth and Environmental Science Journalism dual master's degree program. Accepting eight students a year who wish to specialize in reporting environmental issues, the Master's program invites applicants with undergraduate degrees in science and environmental studies, along with applicants with degrees or professional experience in journalism. Applications are only accepted for fall semester. The application deadline is February 15. The two year interdisciplinary program requires course work in both journalism and hard sciences. The program trains graduate students to communicate environmental issues through various platforms such as print and photo stories, multimedia projects, and web and broadcast documentaries. =Curriculum= The program is based on a total of 36 credits. Graduate level journalism courses consist of 18 credits, while 12 credits must be earned in non-journalism graduate courses in environmental sciences. The journalism graduate courses available to students range from skill focused classes like learning documentary photojournalism to covering and reporting on Native American issues across the Montana's seven reservations. An internship is also required for the degree, but the program challenges students to apply for intern positions at natural resource and environmental science organizations, like the United States Forest Service. The program's website explains how the \\"externship\\" works. \\"The purpose of the externship is to \\"switch sides\\": Rather than working as reporters, editors or communications specialists, as they would during an internship, students work as firefighters, field technicians, farmhands, lab assistants or contract laborers. They shadow company executives and contribute to research, but they don't help develop publications or write press releases.\\" Graduate students are required to produce a professional project. The project is an in-depth story covering an environmental science or natural resource issue. The project may be one large, documentary style piece or a series of shorter thematically related stories. The topic is subjected to approval by the student's project committee. Features The Montana Kaimin became a daily newspaper in 1938, allowing students to hone their journalism skills in a real-world environment. Likewise, the campus radio station KBGA provides opportunities for students in broadcast journalism, and radio production programs.

Faupala was officially crowned Lavelua on July 25, 2008, succeeding Tomasi Kulimoetoke II, who died in May 2007. He was removed from office in September 2014.  Biography  Faupala is locally known as Kalae Kivalu before his coronation, by Wallisians. He was chosen by the late King of 'Uvea Tomasi Kulimoetoke II, to become the holder of the \\"Kalae Kivalu\\" Title (Prime Minister). He is from the village of Ahoa, which is located in the center of Wallis Island. Faupala is a retired public servant, who worked for the French administration of Wallis and Futuna as well as the local Wallisian public works department until his retirement in 1995. As Kalae Kivalu, Faupala was head of the Customary Council of Ministers for four years from approximately 2004 until his coronation in 2008. The Customary Council of Ministers enjoys a certain level of official recognition from the government of France under the 1961 treaty signed by Tomasi Kulimoetoke II which made Wallis and Futuna a French overseas territory (Territoire d'Outre- Mer).  Lavelua  Faupala's predecessor as Lavelua of Wallis, Tomasi Kulimoetoke II, died in May 2007. Kulimoetoke had served as the King for 48 years since his coronation in 1959. A six-month period of mourning was held after Kulimoetoke's death, when it was considered taboo by Wallisians to discuss a possible successor to the throne. Kulimoetoke had a sometimes strained relationship with French authorities during the final years of his reign. The period of mourning officially ended in November 2007, at which time discussions for a possible successor formally began. A Council of Ministers had taken up the role of royal duties after Kuliemoetoke's death and was charged with finding his successor. Two main feuding royal families of Wallis had been engaged in a behind the scenes fight for the previous three years to secure the throne of Uvea. Their struggle to succeed Kulimoetoke had begun before the previous King's death in 2007. The royal Wallisian families, or clans, were from the North (Hihifo) and South (Mu'a) of Wallis Island. Each offered their own candidate to succeed Kuliemoetoke. Each royal clan also claimed to be the rightful next-in-line to the throne, which led to an impasse in negotiations for months. Ultimately, after months of deliberations, the traditional Council of Ministers chose Kapiliele Faupala to become the new King of Wallis (Uvea) in an announcement held in mid July 2008. Kuliemoetoke had originally chosen Faupala as his hand-picked successor before his death in May 2007. The candidates from the other feuding chiefly clans and royal families on Wallis were rejected by the Council. The announcement of Faupala as the new King sparked protests by the other royal families and clans across Wallis. Critics charged that the Council of Ministers should have more actively worked toward reconciling the different arguing clans on Wallis before announcing a final choice for King of Uvea. The North and South royal families also claimed that they should have been actively consulted by the Council in choosing the new monarch for the island. The Kulitea of the minority called \\"Rénovateurs\\", Po'oi Fotofili, called for calm and denounced calls for violence saying, \\"We have decided not to move for the time being. We will let this crowning take its own course. We are calling on our people to remain calm in order to maintain peace on the territory. But this doesn't mean that we will just sit back and watch.\\" He hinted at future action by the disgruntled royal clans following the coronation, including the possibility of appointing additional, new rival Kings on Wallis Island who are not endorsed by the Council of Ministers. As Fotofili said to the three main royal family clans on Wallis - Mu'a, Hahake and Hihifo - \\"Should we have one King for each district, or just one King for all three districts? Should the current situation be reviewed? All this will be put on the table and discussed with all the great families.\\" = Coronation = Kapiliele Faupala was formally crowned the 51st Lavelua of Wallis on July 25, 2008. He chose to retain the title and name of Lavelua. His coronation took place in Mata-Utu, the capital of Wallis and Futuna, on the main grounds of Malae Sagato Soane and gathered more than 3,000 persons, where Faupala's predecessor, Tomasi Kulimoetoke II, is buried. The coronation ended several days of formal traditional Wallisian celebrations, which included a kava ceremony and the presentation of gifts to the new King. Faupala was 68 years old at the time of his coronation. Several of Wallis's chiefly royal families, only in the North (Hihifo), chose not to attend Faupala's coronation due to the ongoing dispute over the royal succession. The coronation took place in the presence of the French Secretary General to the Administrator Superior of Wallis and Futuna, since the current Administrator Superior, Richard Didier, was traveling outside of Wallis and Futuna at the time. A large delegation from New Caledonia, which is also a French overseas possession, also attended the coronation. There are currently over 23,000 citizens of Wallis and Futuna residing in New Caledonia, which makes them an important community. New Caledonian dignitaries included Marie- Claude Tjibaou, the current Chair of Agency for the Development of Kanak Culture. A number of pro-French New Caledonian political parties were also represented including the president of Future Together, Didier Leroux. Other New Caledonian political and traditional figures, such as the Chairman of South Province Philippe Gomès and the High Chief of Lifou Island, Evanes Boula, also attended Faupala's coronation on invitation. The New Caledonian delegation was careful not to become involved with the internal Wallisian royal succession dispute. Didier Leroux said in an interview with the local Réseau France Outre-mer television station that, \\"We were invited to attend the ceremonies. But I'd like to point out that we come as external observers and I would not like to take sides in the current quarrel between one side or the other.\\"  References  Living people Wallis and Futuna monarchs 1940 births ","title":"Kapeliele Faupala"},{"id":"18604503","text":"George Llewellyn Lloyd (1877-1 August 1957) was a Welsh international half- back who played club rugby for Newport and county rugby with Kent.

Some authors say the Infante was also made Duke of Trancoso (in Portuguese, Duque de Trancoso) at the same date (according to Arquivo do Conselho Nobiliárquico de Portugal, Vol I, 78). However, the majority of historians maintain that the Dukedom of Trancoso did not exist, and that the confusion comes from the fact that Infante Ferdinand (Fernando, in Portuguese) was also Lord of Trancoso. Finally, others say he was Duke of Guarda and Trancoso (a joint dukedom). Whatever the truth of this, it is certain that Infante Ferdinand was the sole bearer of the title of Duke of Guarda. According to the will of his father, King Manuel I, Infante Ferdinand was intended to marry the rich and prestigious heiress Dona Guiomar Coutinho, 5th Countess of Marialva and 3rd Countess of Loulé. But when the Infante's marriage was announced, the Marquis of Torres Novas (who later became the 1st Duke of Aveiro) declared that he had already secretly married the rich heiress. The scandal in the Court ended when King John III ordered the imprisonment of the marquis for several years, allowing the celebration of the Infante Ferdinand's marriage. The marriage was short but apparently happy: the couple had two children (a boy and a girl), who died at a very young age, before their parents.

Biography Attanasio was born in Milan. After studies at the Academy of Arts of Milan, Dino Attanasio started to work in illustration and animation in the 1940s. He moved to Belgium in 1948 with his brother Gianni, also an artist. Shortly after his arrival, the young artist got in contact with Tintin magazine, for which he drew some illustrations, and decided to devote himself to comics. In the 1950s, he published Criche e Croc in the Italian magazine Il Giornalino and Fanfan et Polo in La Libre Belgique with scripts by Jean-Michel Charlier and then René Goscinny. At that time, he also worked for Spirou magazine with some contributions to Les Belles Histoires de l'Oncle Paul. In 1954, he published \\"Pastis et Dynamite\\" in Line with Greg. He became popular in the late 1950s and 1960s thanks to The Adventures of Signor Spaghetti, a comic series he created with Goscinny, published in Tintin after 1957. From 1959 à 1962 he published in Femmes d'aujourd'hui the comics series version of Les Aventures de Bob Morane, a series of novels written by Henri Vernes and for which he made some illustrations and art covers in the Marabout Junior collection. However, he is replaced for this job by Gérald Forton. Then, from 1961 to 1968, he took over the series Modeste et Pompon, originally created by Franquin. After his departure from Tintin in 1968, Attanasio started working for the Dutch market, creating the series Johnny Goodbye with Martin Lodewijk and Patty Klein for Eppo and Pep, with Bandoneon (with Delporte) in Pep and with De Macaroni's (with Dick Matena), but also for Italian magazines with \\"Ambroise et Gino\\" in Corriere dei piccoli. From 1974 to 1986 he took on the Spaghetti series again in Formule 1, published in albums by Archers. In 1991 Attanasio created a comic adaptation of Boccaccio's literary classic Decameron with his son, published by Lefrancq. In 1994, he took over the series Bob Morane for one story only. Since then, new works have made rarer and some have publishers rediscovered some of his works, as Carnets de route in 1999 by Point Image and since 2002 some shorts stories originally published in Tintin, by Loup.

It is bordered by Ir Ganim to the south and east, Mount Ora to the west, and the Jerusalem hills to the north. To the west are steep hills that descend toward streams that flow into Nahal Sorek to the north of Hadassah Ein Karem Hospital. The neighborhood overlooks the village of Ein Karem, Nahal Sorek, and the ruins of Sataf. Name The neighborhood was named for American Zionist leader Max (Menachem) Bressler, head of the Jewish National Fund, during his lifetime. (See also full text.) Demographics Kiryat Menachem and Ir Ganim are a single geographic unit with a population of about 15,000. The neighborhood's population is quite heterogeneous, with veteran residents and new immigrants from Ethiopia and the former Soviet Union. There are various types of housing in the neighborhood, in keeping with the population's mixture of socioeconomic levels. These include low-rise buildings and homes with gardens, mainly in Ir Ganim A and Ir Ganim B, and high-rise buildings of 4–8 stories with very small apartments throughout most of the rest of the neighborhood. Some of these buildings, particularly in Ir Ganim C and parts of Kiryat Menachem, were erected in the 1950s as temporary housing for immigrants, and are now in serious disrepair. In the 1990s urban renewal projects were carried out in these neighborhoods and some of the buildings were renovated and expanded. Since this neighborhood is on the outskirts of Jerusalem and has a mixture of populations that have no easy access to the cultural and leisure activities in the city center, the Kiryat Menachem-Ir Ganim neighborhood has developed social solidarity and community institutions that make this area a desirable place to live. Educational institutions Kiryat Menachem has many educational institutions, including the Henrietta Szold Institute, National Institute for Research in the Behavioral Sciences, Guatemala School, Chabad School and Reishit state religious school built by the urban kibbutz located in the neighborhood. The local Amit high school is for both religious and non-religious students, with the vast majority of the students coming from outside the neighborhood. Kiryat Menachem's youth belong to chapters of three youth movements: Scouts, Ezra and Acharai. Community organizations Various community organizations operate in Kiryat Menachem, such as: *Ganim Community Council *Food Cooperative (Established by the Community Advocacy organization) *Yad Marlene (Support center for elementary school children) *Urban Kibbutz \\"Reishit\\" *Tzeva (Center for mentoring immigrant children) *Educational welfare (a branch of the government project for investing in education) *Social neighborhood renewal *Kidum Noar (youth guidance organization) *Garin Dvash (an ecological group for community environmental development) *Shachen Tov (Good Neighbor - distribution of food for families in need) *Machshava Tova (Accessing computers to the community) *The National Program for Children and Youth at Risk *\\"Rachel\\" Child Development Center There are many active volunteer groups in Kiryat Menachem, joined each year by graduates of the \\"Scouts\\" and \\"Acharai\\" youth movements. Further more there is also a group of national service girls from the \\"Bat Ami\\" organization. Ganim Community Council Kiryat Menachem water tower Ganim Community Council serves the Kiryat Menachem, Ir Ganim and Givat Massuah neighborhoods. The Community Council was established in the 1980s as part of the organization of Community Council throughout the city. The Community Council is administered by publicly elected leaders who serve as mediators between the community and the authorities. Ganim Community Council provides services in the areas of education, social services and leisure to a mixed population of various ages.

Part of the route is still in use today as the Oxford to Bicester Line.  History =Origins= The origins of the Buckinghamshire Railway can be traced back to the gauge and territorial wars which took place in Buckinghamshire in the 1840s. The London and Birmingham Railway (L&B;) had opened a standard gauge line from to on 16 October 1837, extending to Birmingham in September 1838. In June of that year, the Great Western Railway (GWR) opened the first part of its broad gauge line from to Bristol and a further branch from to had been opened by June 1844. The GWR subsequently looked to expand beyond Oxford by depositing bills for the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway and the Oxford and Rugby Railway which would take it into the heart of the Midlands. Seeking to prevent the GWR from annexing Buckinghamshire into its empire, the L&B;, supported by the Midland Railway, countered with the London, Worcester and South Staffordshire Railway from Tring to Wolverhampton via Aylesbury. The scheme included loop lines from Bicester to Oxford and Banbury to Rugby. A third company, Mark Huish's Grand Junction Railway, supported the GWR's schemes as a means of forcing the London and Birmingham to merge with it; it proposed a Birmingham and Oxford Junction Railway which would join with the Oxford and Rugby at Fenny Compton. The GWR's schemes subsequently received Parliamentary approval, whilst the London and Birmingham was obliged to withdraw its proposal. The Grand Junction Railway's scheme was also passed, giving the GWR its route to Birmingham, and it merged with the L&B; in 1846 to form the London and North Western Railway (LNWR). The remains of the loop lines became the Buckingham and Brackley Junction Railway and the Oxford and Bletchley Junction Railway. =Authorisation= Three bills were presented to Parliament in 1846-47 for the formation of railway companies to construct the relics of the thwarted L&B; and LNWR ambitions in Buckinghamshire. The first two bills were for the establishment of the Buckingham and Brackley Junction Railway and the Oxford and Bletchley Junction Railway to construct lines from Bletchley to Oxford via Winslow and Bicester, and another from a point near Claydon House to Brackley and Buckingham. The third bill was for the amalgamation of the two companies into the Buckinghamshire Railway and the authorisation of an extension from Buckingham to Banbury. The bills were passed and, under the direction of the LNWR, the Buckinghamshire Railway was formed on 22 July 1847. The second Duke of Buckingham was chairman until he encountered financial difficulties and was replaced by Sir Harry Verney, with Buckingham's son, the Marquess of Chandos, taking a seat on the board. =Later history= Robert Stephenson was employed to construct the line, with Thomas Brassey as the civil engineering contractor. The line opened between Bletchley and Banbury (via Verney Junction) on 30 March 1850, and between Verney Junction and Oxford on 20 May 1851. The line was worked by the LNWR, which originally leased the line, eventually absorbing the Buckinghamshire Railway on 21 July 1879. The Buckinghamshire Railway made modest profits until its valuable freight was re- routed through Oxford and Didcot, leaving it to sink into losses from which it never re-emerged. It continued until the Chairman of the LNWR, Richard Moon, was elected to the board on 23 February 1878 and by 15 July in the same year the company's shares had been consolidated with those of the LNWR. In 1879, the LNWR also absorbed the Bedford Railway which had constructed a line between Bletchley and . It had already absorbed the Bedford and Sandy Railway in 1865, which had constructed a line between Bedford and . Present status The line between Oxford and Cambridge was subsequently known as the Varsity Line and that between Banbury and Bletchley was worked as a separate line, the Banbury to Verney Junction Branch Line. The second line closed to all traffic by the end of 1966, while the Bedford to Cambridge section of the first line was closed as from the beginning of 1968. The section from Bedford to Bletchley remains as the Marston Vale Line and that between Oxford and Bicester was closed, but reopened to passenger traffic in 1986. Reopening plans , the - section of the line is in operation. By 2025, the line is scheduled to reopen from Bicester through as far as , with a new station at . In the longer term, the route to is to be re-established via a new junction with the East Coast Main Line, between and (near the site of the former ). The BedfordCambridge section is to use a new route because the trackbed of the former Varsity Line has been built over.

History Dorot was established during Hanukkah in 1941 by Jewish refugees from Germany, who farmed grain, fruit trees, and vegetables. Soil erosion was a particular problem for the kibbutz. It was named after three members of the Hoz family, Dov, Rivka and Tirtza, who had died in a car accident the year before. The founders were later joined by native Israelis and immigrants from Czechoslovakia and Latvia. In 1947 it had a population of 300. In the summer of 1946, Dorot and the neighbouring village of Ruhama were occupied by the British army. In their search for illicit arms in the village, the British troops inflicted considerable material damage on the village. During the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, and the battle for the Negev, Dorot was cut off and had to be supplied by air until it was liberated in October 1948. After 1948, Dorot expanded on the land of the Palestinian Arab village of Huj, which was depopulated during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.

A feud took place between the Mackenzies, led by Kenneth Mackenzie, 1st Lord Mackenzie of Kintail and the Clan MacDonell of Glengarry. The Mackenzies wanted the MacDonell Laird of Glengarry to appear before the Justice court at Edinburgh for previous crimes against them. Meanwhile, two MacDonells were killed.

As he did not appear in court the Mackenzies wasted the MacDonell country of Morar. The two sides met and a battle took place with (according to some accounts) great slaughter on both sides. According to historian Alexander Mackenzie the Clan Mackenzie were supported by the Clan Ross at the battle of Morar. This was due to Kenneth Mackenzie, 1st Lord Mackenzie of Kintail being married to Ann Ross daughter of George Ross of Balnagowan, chief of Clan Ross. After this they came to an agreement to obtain peace where Glengarry MacDonald was glad to requite and renounce to the Lord MacKenzie of Kintail, and give him the inheritance of the lands of Strome.

It has the distinction of being one of small number of collections intended by the respective authors to contain only authentic hadith. The author of this Sahih is , from Bust in Khorasan in present-day southern Afghanistan (former name of Helmand province capital was bost or bust , its new name is Lashkargah). He was a prominent Shafi'i hadith specialist and prolific author who died in 965 CE., by al-Kattani, pg. 20-1, Dar al-Basha'ir al-Islamiyyah, seventh edition, 2007. Overview The actual name of this collection is al Musnad al Sahih al-Taqasim wa al-Anwa\`, however, it is commonly referred to as Sahih ibn Hibban. The author utilized an innovative method in the arrangement of this work as it is not arranged in topical chapters nor is it based upon a musnad arrangement and is therefore difficult to navigate. Instead, it was arranged first by bab, or chapter, and then under each chapter, by naw\`, or type. The book opens with a lengthy introduction.Bustan al-Muhaddithin, by 'Abd al-'Aziz al-Dihlawi, pg. 90, Dar al-Gharab al-Islami, Beirut, first edition, 2002. The Sahih remains in its entirety as of the late Nineteenth Century or early Twentieth Century, according to al-Kattani, who died in 1926. Description The book contains almost seven and a half thousand (7500) hadiths according to Maktaba Shamila. Authenticity According to al-Kattani, \\"it has been said that Ibn Hibban, after ibn Khuzaymah, authored the most authentic hadith collection, after Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim\\". However, al-Suyuti spoke more definitively when saying that Sahih Ibn Khuzaymah was the most authentic collection after Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim, followed by Sahih Ibn Hibban which, in turn, was more authentic than Al-Mustadrak alaa al-Sahihain,Tadrib al-Rawi, vol. 1, pg. 148, Dar al-'Asimah, Riyadh, first edition, 2003. making Sahih Ibn Hibban the fourth most authentic hadith collection in Suyuti's view. Derivative Works Al-Ihsan: Ali ibn Balban (d. 739/1339) rearranged the hadith chapters of Sahih Ibn Hibban according to the topics of jurisprudence and published them as al-Ihsan fi Taqrib Sahih Ibn Hibban.

It is based at Araxos Air Base in the Peloponnese, and, following the withdrawal of the type from 335th Squadron, it is the last HAF unit equipped with the A-7 Corsair. History=Foundation and service in World War II= After the fall of Greece to the German Wehrmacht, the Greek government in exile established Greek armed forces to fight alongside the Allies in the Middle East. By 1942, two Greek squadrons, the 13th Light Bomber Squadron and the 335th Fighter Squadron, were operating under British command. Their good service record and the existence of sufficient numbers of Greek pilots, newly graduated from aviation schools in Rhodesia, led to the establishment of a third squadron. The 336th Royal Hellenic Pursuit Squadron (336 Βασιλική Ελληνική Μοίρα Διώξεως, 336 Β.Ε.Μ.Δ.), designated within the British Royal Air Force as No 336 (Greek) Squadron, was established on 25 February 1943 at LG 219.RAF Squadron Histories Equipped with 21 Hurricane Mk IIc aircraft and under the command of Flight Lieutenant Spyridon Diamantopoulos, it counted many veteran pilots from 335 Squadron in its ranks.The Desert Squadrons, p. 73 This allowed the unit to quickly begin operations: its first combat mission was carried out on 1 March,The Desert Squadrons, p. 74 and the unit was declared operational on 11 April.336 Bomber Squadron, Hellenic Air Force website It was subsequently employed in shipping protection and air defence duties along the Libyan coast, as well as fighter sweeps. The squadron received its first six Spitfire Mk Vc aircraft on 12 October, and over the month of November it participated in several Allied raids against Crete. Although successful, these missions involved great danger from the German air defence and the Luftwaffe, and resulted in several losses. By March 1944, the unit had been completely re-equipped with Spitfires, and on 15 September, the squadron was moved along with its sister unit to the Italian theatre, from where it carried out operations primarily over occupied Yugoslavia.The Desert Squadrons, p. 75 In November the Greek squadrons returned to liberated Greece, where they were engaged in operations from the Ellinikon airfield against the remaining German garrisons in the Aegean islands and Crete. In May 1945, the squadron moved to Sedes airfield near Thessaloniki, where, on 31 July 1945, the squadron was disbanded from the RAF and transferred to Greek control. =Post-war history= F-104G Starfighter painted in the special \\"Olympus\\" scheme for the type's decommissioning from 336 Squadron. Subsequently, 336 Squadron took part in the air operations of the Greek Civil War (1946–49). In February 1949 it was rebased to Larissa under the 110th Combat Wing. In August, the squadron was equipped with the US- made Curtiss SB2C Helldiver dive bombers, being redesignated as the 336th Light Bomber Squadron (336 Μοίρα Ελαφρού Βομβαρδισμού). In 1953 it was equipped with Republic F-84G Thunderjets and redesignated 336th Fighter-Bomber Squadron (336 Μοίρα Διώξεως-Βομβαρδισμού). On 28 December 1953, the squadron was transferred to 111th Combat Wing at Nea Anchialos, where it received the new Republic F-84F Thunderstreak in 1958. Redeployed again to Larissa in March 1959, it was transferred to 116th Combat Wing in December 1962. On 25 September 1963 it was redesignated as a Strike Squadron (Μοίρα Κρούσης) as a reflection of its new role. On 15 January 1965 the squadron was partially equipped with the new Lockheed F-104G Starfighter fighters, and the F-104 section moved to the 114th Combat Wing at Tanagra, while the remainder of the squadron, still equipped with the F-84F, remained at Araxos. In August, the F-84F-equipped section was designated as the 349 Fighter-Bomber Squadron, before being transferred to Larissa in November 1966. In December, the F-104G-equipped 336 Squadron returned from Tanagra to Araxos, where it remains to this day. The squadron would continue to fly the Starfighter until March 1993, following which the squadron was equipped with the Vought A-7E Corsair (from a batch of 62 handed over by the US Air Force as surplus following the First Gulf War), and established in its present form as the 336 Bomber Squadron on 3 April 1993.

Rival techniques for rearing queen bees generally require grafting the honeybee larvae by hand. As such, the development of this kit by Karl Jenter is a significantly useful tool to assist in beekeeping. Application Beekeepers once had to graft the honeybee eggs or larvae by hand, using tiny scoup-like tools and in some cases by using tools such as tweezers. This fiddly approach would frequently result in the damaging of the egg or larva that was being grafted thus halting the development into a queen bee. The Jenter kit uses a system of plastic cups or 'cells' in which a queen bee can lay her eggs. The cells containing the eggs can then be removed from the laying box and placed into an isolated box for larval development - with no direct handling of the larvae. As the first queen bee to hatch will kill rival hatchlings, the eggs are covered with a small plastic cage. This prevents a newly hatched queen from approaching the other eggs, and thus harming them. This allows a beekeeper to return to the hive to find a large number of newly hatched queen bees. Within 30 days, it is possible to rear as many as 50 queens using a single Jenter kit. Challenges with using the Jenter kit range from queens taking several days to decide to use the cups to lay in, to having to carefully observe the eggs and larvae which are hard to see due to the coloration of the cups in the kit. Usage In modern times, the Jenter kit is in use by Western European and North American apiarists. The kit allows for Queen bees to be produced commercially to supply other beekeepers, or a beekeeper may increase their number of hives. Both uses have become increasingly important as a mechanism to maintain large numbers of bee colonies worldwide in the fight against Varroa mites and Colony collapse disorder.

Conservation status This species is classified as Vulnerable (VU) on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species with the following criteria: B1ab(iii) (v3.1, 2001). A species is listed as such when the best available evidence indicates that the geographic range, in the form of extent of occurrence, is estimated to be less than 20,000 km², that estimates indicate it to be severely fragmented or known to exist at no more than 10 locations, and that a continuing decline has been observed, inferred or projected, in area, extent and/or quality of habitat. It is therefore considered to be facing a high risk of extinction in the wild. In 2007 when it was last assessed, the population trend was down. Behavior Night-time temperatures throughout its range are low, and this species only seems to be active during the day. Individuals have frequently been seen coiled on or near fallen logs, as well as in bushes and small trees above the ground. Feeding The diet consists of rodents and lizards.

Sumas Mountain, also referred to as Canadian Sumas to distinguish it from an identically-named mountain just south in Washington state, is a mountain rising from the floodplain of the Fraser River in the Lower Mainland of southwestern British Columbia, Canada. Its western end is in the urban area of Abbotsford and is home to a number of suburban areas of that city, notably Clayburn. In its central portion is the historic community of Straiton, officially named in 1904 for Thomas Bell Straiton who founded a homestead on Sumas Mountain in 1893 and also a store and post office. Its higher eastern reaches tower over Greendale, a community within the City of Chilliwack and is mostly wilderness; the mountain's summit, Sumas Peak, is located in this area, along with Chadsey Lake. The mountain is separated from the Cascade Mountains by the drained lake now called Sumas Prairie, south of which is its American sister, Sumas Mountain, and which is part of the greater floodplain of the Fraser River (the Fraser Lowland). West of the mountain is Matsqui Prairie, another floodplain, and north of the Fraser, which lies along the mountain's north flank, are similar floodplains - Nicomen Island and Hatzic Prairie. Sumas Mountain Provincial Park is located in the higher, northern reaches of the mountain. Historic industry on the mountain includes livestock and crop farming, logging, and mining, notably brick-clay, which gave rise to the mining community of Clayburn. Farming, gravel mining, and logging continue on the mountain to the present day. Located on the mountain's north foot, adjacent to the Fraser, is a Canadian Forces base naval station. On its south side is the reserve of the Sumas First Nation.

Prasad was born in 1858 in the north Indian city of Moradabad, then in the United Provinces. Prasad was born without his right hand. He later worked as a journalist in Moradabad when he became involved in the emerging nationalist movement. He was at this time the editor of the Peshwa. His editorials were noted for sarcastic and unsparing criticisms of the Punjab government policies. He was incarcerated twice in 1897. In 1900, Prasad became involved in the agrarian movement that was emerging in Punjab. His associates at the time included Sardar Ajit Singh (uncle of Bhagat Singh), Mahasha Ghaseeta Ram, Kartar Singh and Lala Lajpat Rai. In 1906, Prasad was one of the key founding members of the Bharat Mata Society. A crackdown later forced him to flee India for Nepal in 1907, where he was granted asylum by Deva Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana. Prasad later fled India for Persia. Around 1910, Indian nationalists groups, especially pan- Islamic ones, were growing in the Ottoman Empire and Persia under the leadership of Sardar Ajit Singh and Sufi Amba Prasad who began their work there around 1909. The recruits to these groups included young radicals of the likes of Rhishikesh Letha, Zia-ul-Haq, and Thakur Das. By 1910, the activities of these groups and their publication, the Hayat, had come under the observation of British intelligence. However, Ajit Singh's departure in 1911 brought the Indian revolutionary activities to a grinding halt, while British representations to Persia successfully curbed whatever activity that remained in the country. However, as World War I began, Prasad again became involved in the Hindu-German Conspiracy. He was at this time associated with Indian revolutionaries of the likes of Har Dayal and Mahendra Pratap. Sufi worked with the revolutionaries of the Berlin Committee in Mesopotamia and Middle East, attempting to spread propaganda among Indian troops of the Indian expeditionary force. His attempts were directed at organising Indian troops into a nationalist force incursions from the western border of India from Persia, through Baluchistan, to Punjab. Amba Prasad was joined during the war by Kedar Nath Sondhi, Rishikesh Letha and Amin Chaudhry. These Indian troops were involved in the capture of the frontier city of Karman and the detention of the British consul there, and also successfully harassed Percy Sykes' Persian campaign against the Baluchi and Persian tribal chiefs who were aided by the Germans. The Aga Khan's brother was killed while fighting the rebels. The rebels also successfully harassed British forces in Sistan in Afghanistan, confining them to Karamshir in Baluchistan, and later moving towards Karachi. Some reports indicate they took control of the coastal towns of Gawador and Dawar. The Baluchi chief of Bampur, having declared his independence from British rule, also joined the Ghadarites. It was not before the war in Europe turned for the worse for the Ottoman Empire and Baghdad was captured by the British forces that the Ghadarite forces, their supply lines starved, were finally dislodged. They retreated to regroup at Shiraz, where they were finally defeated after a bitter fight during the siege of Shiraz. Amba Prasad Sufi was killed in this battle, but the Ghadarites carried on guerrilla warfare along with Iranian partisans until 1919. The works of Amba Prasad had a significant impact on Bhagat Singh.

DeSylva and Lew Brown, music by Ray Henderson and additional songs by Dorothy Fields (lyrics) and Jimmy McHugh (music). The cast featured Bert Lahr, Charlotte Greenwood, Pat O'Brien, Charles Winninger and Hedda Hopper, with Gus Arnheim and his orchestra. Plot Waitress Pansy Botts (Charlotte Greenwood) places an ad in the Pilot's Gazette for a husband, offering a $500 reward, but is unsuccessful. At the nearby airfield, inventor Rusty Krouse (Bert Lahr) has built the \\"Aerocopter\\", intending to enter it in the upcoming 10th Annual Air Show. With finances depleted, Rusty looks to Sport Wardell (Pat O'Brien) for help in finding a wealthy investor. Soon, Fred Smith (Guy Kibbee) and his daughter Eileen (Kathryn Crawford) show some interest in the Aerocopter, but have no ready cash. Rusty is worried that his partner will go to jail after accepting a check from Mr. Smith. Sport convinces him to marry Pansy and use her $500 dowry to salvage the company's future. Sport convinces Pansy that she is marrying the man in the picture (Clark Gable) he shows her. Nevertheless, she is instantly attracted to Rusty. The deal with the Smiths falls through when both Smith and Sport are arrested for shady dealing. Sport tells his new love, Eileen, that he has to find bail money and the only way is for Rusty to fly his invention at the air show and win the prize money. In order to qualify as a pilot, Rusty ends up being examined by Doctor Brown (Charles Winninger), who thinks he is mad. Pansy chases after the reluctant groom, who has gotten cold feet, and finally traps him. During the air show, both Pansy and Rusty end up at the airport and in the Aerocopter. After taking off clumsily, crashing through the roof of a hangar, once in the air, Rusty tells Pansy that an important part is out on the wing and they need it to land. Pansy climbs onto the wing, but has to parachute to safety. Rusty keeps flying higher, reaching a height of 53,000 feet before he releases fuel and eventually descends, passing Pansy on her way down.

Adapted from original made by R.S. Bhalerao. Quark–gluon plasma or QGP is an interacting localized assembly of quarks and gluons at thermal (local kinetic) and (close to) chemical (abundance) equilibrium. The word plasma signals that free color charges are allowed. In a 1987 summary, Léon van Hove pointed out the equivalence of the three terms: quark gluon plasma, quark matter and a new state of matter. Since the temperature is above the Hagedorn temperature—and thus above the scale of light u,d-quark mass—the pressure exhibits the relativistic Stefan-Boltzmann format governed by fourth power of temperature and many practically mass free quark and gluon constituents. We can say that QGP emerges to be the new phase of strongly interacting matter which manifests its physical properties in terms of nearly free dynamics of practically massless gluons and quarks. Both quarks and gluons, must be present in conditions near chemical (yield) equilibrium with their colour charge open for a new state of matter to be referred to as QGP. Quark–gluon plasma filled the entire Universe before matter was created. Theories predicting the existence of quark–gluon plasma were developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Discussions around heavy ion experimentation followed suit and the first experiment proposals were put forward at CERN and BNL in the following years. Quark–gluon plasma was detected for the first time in the laboratory at CERN in the year 2000. Timeline of the CERN-SPS relativistic heavy ion program before QCG discovery.  General introduction  Quark–gluon plasma is a state of matter in which the elementary particles that make up the hadrons of baryonic matter are freed of their strong attraction for one another under extremely high energy densities. These particles are the quarks and gluons that compose baryonic matter. In normal matter quarks are confined; in the QGP quarks are deconfined. In classical QCD quarks are the fermionic components of hadrons (mesons and baryons) while the gluons are considered the bosonic components of such particles. The gluons are the force carriers, or bosons, of the QCD color force, while the quarks by themselves are their fermionic matter counterparts. We study quark–gluon plasma to recreate and understand the high energy density conditions prevailing in the Universe when matter formed from elementary degrees of freedom (quarks, gluons) at about 20μs after the Big Bang. Experimental groups are probing over a ‘large’ distance the (de)confining quantum vacuum structure, the present day relativistic æther, which determines prevailing form of matter and laws of nature. The experiments give insight to the origin of matter and mass: the matter and antimatter is created when the quark–gluon plasma ‘hadronizes’ and the mass of matter originates in the confining vacuum structure.  How the quark–gluon plasma fits into the general scheme of physics  QCD is one part of the modern theory of particle physics called the Standard Model. Other parts of this theory deal with electroweak interactions and neutrinos. The theory of electrodynamics has been tested and found correct to a few parts in a billion. The theory of weak interactions has been tested and found correct to a few parts in a thousand. Perturbative forms of QCD have been tested to a few percent. Perturbative models assume relatively small changes from the ground state, i.e. relatively low temperatures and densities, which simplifies calculations at the cost of generality. In contrast, non- perturbative forms of QCD have barely been tested. The study of the QGP, which has both a high temperature and density, is part of this effort to consolidate the grand theory of particle physics. The study of the QGP is also a testing ground for finite temperature field theory, a branch of theoretical physics which seeks to understand particle physics under conditions of high temperature. Such studies are important to understand the early evolution of our universe: the first hundred microseconds or so. It is crucial to the physics goals of a new generation of observations of the universe (WMAP and its successors). It is also of relevance to Grand Unification Theories which seek to unify the three fundamental forces of nature (excluding gravity).Five reasons to study quark–gluon plasma. The background of the slide is based on the Sistine Chapel ceiling fresco \\"The Creation of Adam\\" by Michelangelo. This picture ornamented the poster of the first quark–gluon plasma summer school \\"Particle Production in Highly Excited Matter\\". = Reasons for studying the formation of quark–gluon plasma = The generally accepted model of the formation of the Universe states that it happened as the result of the Big Bang. In this model, in the time interval of 10−10–10−6 s after the Big Bang, matter existed in the form of a quark–gluon plasma. It is possible to reproduce the density and temperature of matter existing of that time in laboratory conditions to study the characteristics of the very early Universe. So far, the only possibility is the collision of two heavy atomic nuclei accelerated to energies of more than a hundred GeV. Using the result of a head-on collision in the volume approximately equal to the volume of the atomic nucleus, it is possible to model the density and temperature that existed in the first instants of the life of the Universe. = Relation to normal plasma = A plasma is matter in which charges are screened due to the presence of other mobile charges. For example: Coulomb's Law is suppressed by the screening to yield a distance-dependent charge, Q \\\\rightarrow Q e^{-r/\\\\alpha}, i.e., the charge Q is reduced exponentially with the distance divided by a screening length α. In a QGP, the color charge of the quarks and gluons is screened. The QGP has other analogies with a normal plasma. There are also dissimilarities because the color charge is non-abelian, whereas the electric charge is abelian. Outside a finite volume of QGP the color-electric field is not screened, so that a volume of QGP must still be color-neutral. It will therefore, like a nucleus, have integer electric charge. Because of the extremely high energies involved, quark-antiquark pairs are produced by pair production and thus QGP is a roughly equal mixture of quarks and antiquarks of various flavors, with only a slight excess of quarks. This property is not a general feature of conventional plasmas, which may be too cool for pair production (see however pair instability supernova). = Theory = One consequence of this difference is that the color charge is too large for perturbative computations which are the mainstay of QED. As a result, the main theoretical tools to explore the theory of the QGP is lattice gauge theory. The transition temperature (approximately ) was first predicted by lattice gauge theory. Since then lattice gauge theory has been used to predict many other properties of this kind of matter. The AdS/CFT correspondence conjecture may provide insights in QGP, moreover the ultimate goal of the fluid/gravity correspondence is to understand QGP. The QGP is believed to be a phase of QCD which is completely locally thermalized and thus suitable for an effective fluid dynamic description. = Production = Production of QGP in the laboratory is achieved by colliding heavy atomic nuclei (called heavy ions as in an accelerator atoms are ionized) at relativistic energy in which matter is heated well above the Hagedorn temperature TH= 150 MeV per particle, which amounts to a temperature exceeding 1.66×1012 K. This can be accomplished by colliding two large nuclei at high energy (note that is not the energy of the colliding beam). Lead and gold nuclei have been used for such collisions at CERN SPS and BNL RHIC, respectively. The nuclei are accelerated to ultrarelativistic speeds (contracting their length) and directed towards each other, creating a \\"fireball\\", in the rare event of a collision. Hydrodynamic simulation predicts this fireball will expand under its own pressure, and cool while expanding. By carefully studying the spherical and elliptic flow, experimentalists put the theory to test. = Diagnostic tools = There is an overwhelming evidence for production of quark–gluon plasma in relativistic heavy ion collisions. The important classes of experimental observations are *Strangeness production *Elliptic flow *Jet quenching *J/ψ melting *Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect and Bose–Einstein correlations *Single particle spectra (photons and dileptons)  Expected properties = Thermodynamics = The cross-over temperature from the normal hadronic to the QGP phase is about . This \\"crossover\\" may actually not be only a qualitative feature, but instead one may have to do with a true (second order) phase transition, e.g. of the universality class of the three-dimensional Ising model. The phenomena involved correspond to an energy density of a little less than . For relativistic matter, pressure and temperature are not independent variables, so the equation of state is a relation between the energy density and the pressure. This has been found through lattice computations, and compared to both perturbation theory and string theory. This is still a matter of active research. Response functions such as the specific heat and various quark number susceptibilities are currently being computed. = Flow = The discovery of the perfect liquid was a turning point in physics. Experiments at RHIC have revealed a wealth of information about this remarkable substance, which we now know to be a QGP. Nuclear matter at \\"room temperature\\" is known to behave like a superfluid. When heated the nuclear fluid evaporates and turns into a dilute gas of nucleons and, upon further heating, a gas of baryons and mesons (hadrons). At the critical temperature, TH, the hadrons melt and the gas turns back into a liquid. RHIC experiments have shown that this is the most perfect liquid ever observed in any laboratory experiment at any scale. The new phase of matter, consisting of dissolved hadrons, exhibits less resistance to flow than any other known substance. The experiments at RHIC have, already in 2005, shown that the Universe at its beginning was uniformly filled with this type of material—a super-liquid—which once the Universe cooled below TH evaporated into a gas of hadrons. Detailed measurements show that this liquid is a quark–gluon plasma where quarks, antiquarks and gluons flow independently.Letter from Berndt Müller to Johann Rafelski, reproduced in \\"Discovery of Quark–Gluon Plasma: Strangeness Diaries\\". The European Physical Journal Special Topics. 229 (1): pp.40–41 doi:10.1140/epjst/e2019-900263-x. ISSN 1951-6401. Schematic representation of the interaction region formed in the first moments after the collision of heavy ions with high energies in the accelerator. In short, a quark–gluon plasma flows like a splat of liquid, and because it's not \\"transparent\\" with respect to quarks, it can attenuate jets emitted by collisions. Furthermore, once formed, a ball of quark–gluon plasma, like any hot object, transfers heat internally by radiation. However, unlike in everyday objects, there is enough energy available so that gluons (particles mediating the strong force) collide and produce an excess of the heavy (i.e. high-energy) strange quarks. Whereas, if the QGP didn't exist and there was a pure collision, the same energy would be converted into a non-equilibrium mixture containing even heavier quarks such as charm quarks or bottom quarks. The equation of state is an important input into the flow equations. The speed of sound (speed of QGP-density oscillations) is currently under investigation in lattice computations. The mean free path of quarks and gluons has been computed using perturbation theory as well as string theory. Lattice computations have been slower here, although the first computations of transport coefficients have been concluded. These indicate that the mean free time of quarks and gluons in the QGP may be comparable to the average interparticle spacing: hence the QGP is a liquid as far as its flow properties go. This is very much an active field of research, and these conclusions may evolve rapidly. The incorporation of dissipative phenomena into hydrodynamics is another active research area. = Jet quenching effect = Detailed predictions were made in the late 1970s for the production of jets at the CERN Super Proton–Antiproton Synchrotron. UA2 observed the first evidence for jet production in hadron collisions in 1981, which shortly after was confirmed by UA1. The subject was later revived at RHIC. One of the most striking physical effects obtained at RHIC energies is the effect of quenching jets. At the first stage of interaction of colliding relativistic nuclei, partons of the colliding nuclei give rise to the secondary partons with a large transverse impulse ≥ 3–6 GeV / s. Passing through a highly heated compressed plasma, partons lose energy. The magnitude of the energy loss by the parton depends on the properties of the quark–gluon plasma (temperature, density). In addition, it is also necessary to take into account the fact that colored quarks and gluons are the elementary objects of the plasma, which differs from the energy loss by a parton in a medium consisting of colorless hadrons. Under the conditions of a quark–gluon plasma, the energy losses resulting from the RHIC energies by partons are estimated as dE / dx = 1 GeV / fm. This conclusion is confirmed by comparing the relative yield of hadrons with a large transverse impulse in nucleon-nucleon and nucleus-nucleus collisions at the same collision energy. The energy loss by partons with a large transverse impulse in nucleon-nucleon collisions is much smaller than in nucleus-nucleus collisions, which leads to a decrease in the yield of high-energy hadrons in nucleus-nucleus collisions. This result suggests that nuclear collisions cannot be regarded as a simple superposition of nucleon-nucleon collisions. For a short time, ~ 1 μs and in the final volume, quarks and gluons form some ideal liquid. The collective properties of this fluid are manifested during its movement as a whole. Therefore, when moving partons in this medium, it is necessary to take into account some collective properties of this quark–gluon liquid. Energy losses depend on the properties of the quark–gluon medium, on the parton density in the resulting fireball, and on the dynamics of its expansion. Losses of energy by light and heavy quarks during the passage of a fireball turn out to be approximately the same. In November 2010 CERN announced the first direct observation of jet quenching, based on experiments with heavy-ion collisions. = Direct photons and dileptons = Direct photons and dileptons are arguably most penetrating tools to study relativistic heavy ion collisions. They are produced, by various mechanisms spanning the space-time evolution of the strongly interacting fireball. They provide in principle a snapshot on the initial stage as well. They are hard to decipher and interpret as most of the signal is originating from hadron decays long after the QGP fireball has disintegrated. = Glasma hypothesis = Since 2008, there is a discussion about a hypothetical precursor state of the quark–gluon plasma, the so-called \\"Glasma\\", where the dressed particles are condensed into some kind of glassy (or amorphous) state, below the genuine transition between the confined state and the plasma liquid. This would be analogous to the formation of metallic glasses, or amorphous alloys of them, below the genuine onset of the liquid metallic state. Although the experimental high temperatures and densities predicted as producing a quark–gluon plasma have been realized in the laboratory, the resulting matter does not behave as a quasi-ideal state of free quarks and gluons, but, rather, as an almost perfect dense fluid. Actually, the fact that the quark–gluon plasma will not yet be \\"free\\" at temperatures realized at present accelerators was predicted in 1984 as a consequence of the remnant effects of confinement.  In-laboratory formation of deconfined matter  A quark–gluon plasma (QGP) or quark soup is a state of matter in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) which exists at extremely high temperature and/or density. This state is thought to consist of asymptotically free strong-interacting quarks and gluons, which are ordinarily confined by color confinement inside atomic nuclei or other hadrons. This is in analogy with the conventional plasma where nuclei and electrons, confined inside atoms by electrostatic forces at ambient conditions, can move freely. Experiments to create artificial quark matter started at CERN in 1986/7, resulting in first claims that were published in 1991. It took several years before the idea became accepted in the community of particle and nuclear physicists. Formation of a new state of matter in Pb-Pb collisions was officially announced at CERN in view of the convincing experimental results presented by the CERN SPS WA97 experiment in 1999, and later elaborated by Brookhaven National Laboratory's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. Quark matter can only be produced in minute quantities and is unstable and impossible to contain, and will radioactively decay within a fraction of a second into stable particles through hadronization; the produced hadrons or their decay products and gamma rays can then be detected. In the quark matter phase diagram, QGP is placed in the high-temperature, high-density regime, whereas ordinary matter is a cold and rarefied mixture of nuclei and vacuum, and the hypothetical quark stars would consist of relatively cold, but dense quark matter. It is believed that up to a few microseconds (10−12 to 10−6 seconds) after the Big Bang, known as the quark epoch, the Universe was in a quark–gluon plasma state. The strength of the color force means that unlike the gas-like plasma, quark–gluon plasma behaves as a near-ideal Fermi liquid, although research on flow characteristics is ongoing. Liquid or even near-perfect liquid flow with almost no frictional resistance or viscosity was claimed by research teams at RHIC and LHC's Compact Muon Solenoid detector. QGP differs from a \\"free\\" collision event by several features; for example, its particle content is indicative of a temporary chemical equilibrium producing an excess of middle- energy strange quarks vs. a nonequilibrium distribution mixing light and heavy quarks (\\"strangeness production\\"), and it does not allow particle jets to pass through (\\"jet quenching\\"). Experiments at CERN's Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) begun experiments to create QGP in the 1980s and 1990s: the results led CERN to announce evidence for a \\"new state of matter\\" in 2000. Scientists at Brookhaven National Laboratory's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider announced they had created quark–gluon plasma by colliding gold ions at nearly the speed of light, reaching temperatures of 4 trillion degrees Celsius. Current experiments (2017) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) on Long Island (NY, USA) and at CERN's recent Large Hadron Collider near Geneva (Switzerland) are continuing this effort,http://www.bnl.gov/rhic/news2/news.asp?a=1074&t;=pr 'Perfect' Liquid Hot Enough to be Quark Soup by colliding relativistically accelerated gold and other ion species (at RHIC) or lead (at LHC) with each other or with protons. Three experiments running on CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC), on the spectrometers ALICE, ATLAS and CMS, have continued studying the properties of QGP. CERN temporarily ceased colliding protons, and began colliding lead ions for the ALICE experiment in 2011, in order to create a QGP. A new record breaking temperature was set by ALICE: A Large Ion Collider Experiment at CERN in August 2012 in the ranges of 5.5 trillion (5.5×1012) kelvin as claimed in their Nature PR. The formation of a quark–gluon plasma occurs as a result of a strong interaction between the partons (quarks, gluons) that make up the nucleons of the colliding heavy nuclei called heavy ions. Therefore experiments are referred to as relativistic heavy ion collision experiments. Theoretical and experimental works show that the formation of a quark–gluon plasma occurs at the temperature of T ≈ 150–160 MeV, the Hagedorn temperature, and an energy density of ≈ 0.4–1 GeV / fm3. While at first a phase transition was expected, present day theoretical interpretations propose a phase transformation similar to the process of ionisation of normal matter into ionic and electron plasma. = Quark–gluon plasma and the onset of deconfinement = The central issue of the formation of a quark–gluon plasma is the research for the onset of deconfinement. From the beginning of the research on formation of QGP, the issue was whether energy density can be achieved in nucleus-nucleus collisions. This depends on how much energy each nucleon loses. A influential reaction picture was the scaling solution presented by Bjorken. This model applies to ultra-high energy collisions. In experiments carried out at CERN SPS and BNL RHIC more complex situation arose, usually divided into three stages: * Primary parton collisions and baryon stopping at the time of complete overlapping of the colliding nuclei. * Redistribution of particle energy and new particles born in the QGP fireball. * The fireball of QGP matter equilibrates and expands before hadronizing. More and more experimental evidence points to the strength of QGP formation mechanisms—operating even in LHC-energy scale proton-proton collisions.

On one finger is a heart-shaped leaf which German painters of the time used as a symbol for the colour green, taken to represent an emerald ring. The same leaf symbol appears in Lady Meutas’s oval medallion. The web site of the Tate Gallery gives the date of the drawing as \\"about 1536\\", and if this is correct, the words 'The Lady Meutas' must have been added some years later, as Peter Meutas was not knighted until 1544. The drawing of Jane Meutas can be compared with another by Holbein, of her royal mistress Jane Seymour, which is also in black and coloured chalks on pink paper.

Blahyi travels Liberia preaching peace and love, denouncing his old way of life.  Early religious beliefs  Blahyi is a member of the Sarpo tribe in Liberia. Krahn elders later appointed him as high priest, a position that would lead him to become the spiritual advisor to Liberian President Samuel Doe. Blahyi adhered to a complex traditional belief system as a Krahn priest. Blahyi himself said, \\"I was a high priest for the biggest god under the Krahn tribe, and the late Samuel K. Doe, being a fellow tribesman, was automatically placed under my jurisdiction . . . I also placed Nyanbe-a- weh amongst the first three high-ranking gods in West Africa’s black-witch coastal line division.\\" Nyanbe-a-weh was Blahyi's idol who—according to him—demanded ritual sacrifice; Blahyi would come to believe that Nyanbe-a-weh was the Devil. He said that the Krahn tribe selects leaders based upon physical prowess rather than birthright. The selection process takes place through an annual fight:  In battle  Blahyi has said he led his troops naked except for shoes and a gun. He believed that his nakedness was a source of protection from bullets. Blahyi stated he would regularly sacrifice a victim before battle. \\"Usually it was a small child, someone whose fresh blood would satisfy the devil.\\" He stated to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer: In January 2008, Blahyi confessed to taking part in human sacrifices which \\"included the killing of an innocent child and taking out the heart, which was divided into pieces for us to eat.\\" Blahyi claimed to a South African Star reporter that he \\"met Satan regularly and talked to him\\" and that from age of 11 to 25 he took part in monthly human sacrifices. Describing a typical battle, Blahyi said: Blahyi also purported that during this period he had \\"magical powers that made him invisible\\" and a \\"special power\\" to capture a town singlehandedly, then call in his troops afterwards to \\"clean up\\". Some of Blahyi's soldiers—often boys in their early teens and younger—would enter battle naked; others would wear women's clothes. In June 2006, Blahyi published his autobiography that included pictures of him fighting with a rifle, wearing nothing but sneakers. During the First Liberian Civil War he led a mercenary unit, many of whom were child soldiers, which was known as the Butt Naked Brigade. They were funded by Roosevelt Johnson and fought alongside the United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy (ULIMO) militia against militias led by Charles Taylor and Prince Yormie Johnson. ULIMO was loyal to Samuel Doe, who was captured and executed personally by Prince Johnson. Taylor eventually took control of the country.  Conversion to Christianity Blahyi's rampage ended in 1996, when the civil war in Liberia was coming to an end. He states his conversion was bolstered by a church in Liberia where Bishop Kun Kun is a pastor. They claimed to have heard from God to fast 54 days for his deliverance. After the fast, they claim God gave them spiritual powers to infiltrate his coven in Monrovia and preach to him. Shortly after, he had a theophany in which Jesus Christ appeared to him as a blinding light, spoke to him as a son, and told him that he would die unless he repented his sins. In 1997, Blahyi traveled to the Buduburam refugee camp in Ghana. It was at the camp, he recounts, that he made confession for his sins at a church and \\"had his life saved\\". Subsequently, when he preaches, he says he sometimes encounters relatives of his victims. \\"I feel very bad, so bad\\", he said, but he insists it was satanic powers that possessed him in the past and he cannot be held responsible. Blahyi is the President of the End Time Train Evangelistic Ministries Inc., with headquarters in Liberia. He is married to Pastor Mrs. Josie and has four children: Michaela, Joshua Milton Jr., Janice Marva and Jackie MaryBeth. In 2004, Liberian-American director Gerald Barclay traveled to Buduburam to shoot a documentary which included interviews with Blahyi. In January 2008, Blahyi returned to Liberia from Ghana and said before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Liberia that between approximately 1980 and 1996 he and his men were responsible for the deaths of more than 20,000 people. Blahyi was the subject of a 2010 documentary film: True Stories: The Redemption of General Butt Naked by the Sundance Institute, produced and directed by Eric Strauss and Daniele Anastasion. In October 2016, Blahyi appealed to donors to donate half a million dollars to his Journeys Against Violence NGO which trains child soldiers and drug addicts in farming and construction.  In popular culture  * General Butt Naked's current life as an evangelist was a significant focus of Vice magazine's documentary The Vice Guide to Liberia. * In their musical The Book of Mormon, Trey Parker, Robert Lopez, and Matt Stone renamed a character to \\"General Butt Fucking Naked\\" after General Butt Naked following rewrites when they felt that General Kony (on whom the character is based) became too controversial following Kony 2012. In footage from early previews of the production, characters can still be heard referring to the character as \\"Warlord Kony\\".

The axis of symmetry passes perpendicularly through the center of the rectangle. Bricard octahedron with an antiparallelogram as its equator. The axis of symmetry passes through the plane of the antiparallelogram. In geometry, a Bricard octahedron is a member of a family of flexible polyhedra constructed by Raoul Bricard in 1897.. Translated into English as \\"Memoir on the theory of the articulated octahedron\\", E. A. Coutsias, 2010. That is, it is possible for the overall shape of this polyhedron to change in a continuous motion, without any changes to the lengths of its edges nor to the shapes of its faces. These octahedra were the first flexible polyhedra to be discovered.. The Bricard octahedra have six vertices, twelve edges, and eight triangular faces, connected in the same way as a regular octahedron. However, unlike the regular octahedron, the Bricard octahedra are all non-convex self-crossing polyhedra. By Cauchy's rigidity theorem, a flexible polyhedron must be non-convex, but there exist other flexible polyhedra without self-crossings. However, avoiding self- crossings requires more vertices (at least nine) than the six vertices of the Bricard octahedra.. In his publication describing these octahedra, Bricard completely classified the flexible octahedra. His work in this area was later the subject of lectures by Henri Lebesgue at the Collège de France. Construction The Bricard octahedra all have an axis of 180° rotational symmetry, and are formed from any three pairs of points such that each pair is symmetric around the same axis and there is no plane containing all six points. (For instance, the six points of a regular octahedron can be paired up in this way by an axial symmetry around a line through two opposite edge midpoints, although the Bricard octahedron resulting from this pairing would not be regular.) The octahedra have 12 edges, each of which connects two points that do not belong to the same symmetric pair as each other. These edges form the octahedral graph . Each of the eight triangular faces of these octahedra connects three points, one from each symmetric pair, in all of the eight possible ways of doing this... =As a linkage= It is also possible to think of the Bricard octahedron as a mechanical linkage consisting of the twelve edges, connected by flexible joints at the vertices, without the faces. Omitting the faces eliminates the self-crossings for many (but not all) positions of these octahedra. The resulting kinematic chain has one degree of freedom of motion, the same as the polyhedron from which it is derived.. Explanation The quadrilaterals formed by the edges between the points in any two symmetric pairs of points can be thought of as equators of the octahedron. These equators have the property (by their symmetry) that opposite pairs of quadrilateral sides have equal length. Every quadrilateral with opposite pairs of equal sides, embedded in Euclidean space, has axial symmetry, and some (such as the rectangle) have other symmetries besides. If one cuts the Bricard octahedron into two open-bottomed pyramids by slicing it along one of its equators, both of these open pyramids can flex, and the flexing motion can be made to preserve the axis of symmetry of the whole shape. But, by the symmetries of its construction, the flexing motions of these two open pyramids both move the equator along which they were cut in the same way. Therefore, they can be glued back together into a single flexing motion of the whole octahedron. The property of having opposite sides of equal length is true of the rectangle, parallelogram, and antiparallelogram, and it is possible to construct Bricard octahedra having any of those flat shapes as their equators. However, the equator of a Bricard octahedron is not required to lie in a plane; instead, it can be a skew quadrilateral. Even for Bricard octahedra constructed to have a flat equator, the equator generally does not remain flat as the octahedron flexes. However, for some Bricard octahedra, such as the octahedron with an antiparallelogram equator shown in the illustration, the symmetries of the polyhedron cause its equator to remain planar at all times. Additional properties The Dehn invariant of any Bricard octahedron remains constant as it undergoes its flexing motion.. This same property has been proven for all non-self-crossing flexible polyhedra. However, there exist other self-crossing flexible polyhedra for which the Dehn invariant changes continuously as they flex.. Extensions It is possible to modify the Bricard polyhedra by adding more faces, in order to move the self- crossing parts of the polyhedron away from each other while still allowing it to flex. The simplest of these modifications is a polyhedron discovered by Klaus Steffen with nine vertices and 14 triangular faces. Steffen's polyhedron is the simplest possible flexible polyhedron without self-crossings. By connecting together multiple shapes derived from the Bricard octahedron, it is possible to construct horn-shaped rigid origami forms whose shape traces out complicated space curves..

It was published in 1998, the sequel to Girls in Love and followed by Girls out Late. It is aimed at pre-teen and teenage readers. Like the rest of the series, Girls under Pressure is told from the viewpoint of Eleanor \\"Ellie\\" Allard, a plump thirteen-year-old girl who lives with her father, her stepmother, Anna, and her little half-brother, Eggs.  Plot  Ellie and her two best friends, Magda and Nadine, are Christmas shopping at the Flowerfields Shopping Centre. While they shop, they notice a large buzz of an event going on upstairs. Nadine wonders if it is for television. Magda replies, \\"Wow, I hope so\\" and steers the other two upstairs, where they join a queue to discover what all the fuss is about. It turns out to be a modelling competition for Spicy magazine, which Ellie discovers after seeing a lot of pretty teenage girls getting their photos taken. Ellie stares in horror as she realises what she has been in the queue for. She witnesses Magda and Nadine being photographed, seeing how pretty Nadine is. It is Ellie's turn to be photographed, but she runs away, pushing through the queue as she goes, resulting in one of the girls in the queue exclaiming \\"She's far too fat [for modelling]\\". Ellie, hurt and upset, leaves and goes home. She begins to display signs of disordered eating from this point, both by restricting her food intake and making herself sick when she feels she has overeaten. It worsens when Nadine gets through to the second round of the Spicy modelling competition. Ellie tries to be supportive but envies all of the models and their bodies and reflects how unfair it is that Nadine is so slim despite taking no care over her diet. However, Nadine is not chosen to go through to the next round. The two quarrel, but make it up on the way home. Meanwhile, Magda has been on a date with an older boy called Mick who assumed she was \\"easy\\" because of her bleached blonde hair and put her under pressure to have sex outside after their date. All three girls are disheartened as a result. Ellie is still in the throes of disordered eating and has started to worry her parents due to her weight loss and their discovery of her eating behaviours. She had previously done an art project with Zoe, an intelligent student who has been put up a year to take her GCSEs early, and had more recently encountered Zoe at the swimming pool. Ellie notices that Zoe used to have a \\"biggish bum\\" and now she has \\"amazing cheekbones\\", due to her lack of food and plentiful exercise. She uses Zoe as inspiration for a time, but one day Zoe is not at the swimming pool or at school. She learns that Zoe has been taken to an eating disorders ward at the local hospital and visits her there. The visit prompts Ellie to examine her behaviours after realising that Zoe got so thin she collapsed and nearly died of heart failure, and she is shocked by how sad and small Zoe looks. Ellie decides that, ultimately, she is not willing to risk everything in the pursuit of being thin and is going to concentrate on being happy instead. 1998 British novels British young adult novels Novels by Jacqueline Wilson 1998 children's books Novels about eating disorders ","title":"Girls Under Pressure"},{"id":"18605574","text":"An outpatient department or outpatient clinic is the part of a hospital designed for the treatment of outpatients, people with health problems who visit the hospital for diagnosis or treatment, but do not at this time require a bed or to be admitted for overnight care. Modern outpatient departments offer a wide range of treatment services, diagnostic tests and minor surgical procedures. Department The outpatient clinic of a hospital, also called an outpatient department provides diagnosis and care for patients that do not need to stay overnight.Segen's Medical Dictionary and Medical Dictionary for the Health Professions and Nursing This is distinct from clinics independent of hospitals, almost all of which are designed mostly or exclusively for outpatient care and may also be called outpatient clinics. The outpatient department is an important part of the overall running of the hospital. It is normally integrated with the in-patient services and manned by consultant physicians and surgeons who also attend inpatients in the wards. Many patients are examined and given treatment as outpatients before being admitted to the hospital at a later date as inpatients. When discharged, they may attend the outpatient clinic for follow-up treatment. The outpatient department will usually be on the ground floor of the hospital with car-parking facilities nearby. Wheelchairs and stretchers are available for non-ambulatory patients. Patients will register at a reception desk and there is seating for them while they wait for their appointments. Each doctor will have a consulting room and there may be smaller waiting areas near these. Paediatric clinics are often held in areas separated from the adult clinics. Close at hand will be X-ray facilities, laboratories, the medical record office and a pharmacy. In the main waiting area there are a range of facilities for the patients and their families including toilets, public telephones, coffee shop or snack bar, water dispenser, gift shop, florist and quiet room. Not all hospitals have separate outpatient departments, so outpatients may be treated in the same departments as patients that stay overnight. Reform The Royal College of Physicians said that UK outpatient clinics were stuck \\"in the 18th Century\\" and an expensive waste of time and money. There were 127 million appointments in 2017 and about 20% of them were cancelled or the patient did not turn up. 57% of them ran late. They wanted more use of remote monitoring, telephone and video consultations and senior nurses running clinics closer to people's homes. The NHS Long Term Plan proposed that up to a third of face-to-face outpatient appointments should be done by video link by 2024. The COVID-19 pandemic in England spurred radical shifts to video appointments as most routine appointments were cancelled. The Attend Anywhere digital healthcare service was installed across NHS organisations in England in March 2020 with backing from NHSX and by May 2020 had been used for more than 79,000 consultations. Payment NHS England proposed changes to payment systems in 2018 aimed at reducing the number of consultant-led appointments and incentivising hospitals to conduct more appointments remotely.

In his seven seasons with the Montreal and Seattle organizations, he compiled a .257 batting average with 51 home runs and 282 RBIs in 594 games. Primarily a first baseman (246 games), he also made appearances as an outfielder (152 games), third baseman (116 games), catcher (21 games), and second baseman (1 game). Biagini turned his hand to managing in 1983 with the Bluefield Orioles of the rookie-level Appalachian League. He managed in the minor leagues for 14 seasons (1983–1991; 1995–1999) for Baltimore and the Texas Rangers, including eight seasons at the Triple-A level. He compiled a record of 937 wins and 923 losses for a .504 winning percentage. Two of his teams won Triple-A-level championships; the 1990 Rochester Red Wings of the International League and the 1996 Oklahoma City 89ers of the American Association. Biagini spent three seasons (1992–1994) in the American League as the major league hitting coach for the Orioles during the managerial term of Johnny Oates. Biagini was later with the Boston Red Sox organization, as a roving minor league batting instructor in 2000, and as an advance scout in 2001. In 2002, he helped run a youth baseball complex in Edmond, Oklahoma. Biagini died in 2003 at age 51 from kidney cancer in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. His son, Tanner, later played two seasons for the Tampa Bay Rays organization as a corner infielder.

The denomination consists of approximately 90 congregations in the United States, Japan, Mexico and Canada. History The origins of the Apostolic Christian Church are found in the conversion experience of Samuel Heinrich Froehlich. (1803–57) of Switzerland. Froehlich was baptized in 1832 and soon founded the Evangelical Baptist Church. The first American church was formed in Lewis County, New York in 1847 by Benedict Weyeneth (1819–87), who had been sent by Froehlich at the request of Joseph Virkler, a Lewis County minister in an Alsatian Amish-Mennonite church. In 1848 a church was formed in Sardis, Ohio. The church experienced primary growth in the midwest, where many congregations gained membership from local Amish and Mennonite churches. Though sometimes referred to as the New Amish, these believers generally called themselves Evangelical Baptist. In 1917, the church adopted a uniform name: Apostolic Christian Church. From the 1920s on, most of the new churches formed in America were founded in metropolitan areas. This was because many of the church's offspring sought occupational opportunities outside of farming. Thus, today the Apostolic Christian Church consists of a blend of city and rural congregations.http://www.apostolicchristian.org/history A sketch of Froehlich; the only known surviving likeness of him Biblical practices and traditions *Members seek to obey the Bible, which they hold to be the infallible Word of God. Many of their practices, however, are not explicitly derived from the Bible. Rather, some of them are biblically inspired traditions derived from the writings of Froehlich (who was strongly influenced by early church writers such as Tertullian) and some are past practices believed to be beneficial. These traditions are passed from one generation to the next and are held in high esteem, but they are never meant to approach the level of Biblical commandments. Traditions within the Apostolic Christian Church are said to help encourage believers in their commitment to serving the Lord, help to knit generations together, and provide close harmony among the various congregations. * Holy Communion is served typically once, or possibly multiple times, during the year for church members, often (but not necessarily) near Easter. The Holy Communion service is a closed service, with only members present. Holy Communion is typically preceded by a period, typically around a month, of self-examination and restitution. *The Holy Kiss is the greeting used in Apostolic Christian churches, based on instructions in the epistles of Paul and the general epistle of 1 Peter. *When single members seek a marriage partner, they are expected to do that within the denomination so that they will be equally yoked. Faith marriage is practiced (seeking the Lord's direction regarding a spouse). Dating and courtship are discouraged. *When there was a Selective Service draft, church members, and sometimes friends (unconverted people, often family members, who attend regularly), served in a non-combatant status in the military. *The taking and swearing of an oath is strongly discouraged, based on Christ's teachings. An affirmation may be used as an alternative in legal, and other, matters. * Almost all congregations practice separated seating for men and women, though this may be relaxed from time to time for special occasions. * Formal business attire is expected during worship services representing unity. Men wear suits and ties to church. Women wear dresses or skirts and are encouraged to be modestly dressed, including not adorning yourself with expensive or flashy jewelry. The use of a lot of cosmetics is discouraged. * Different congregations typically exchange \\"greetings\\" between each other and their members, either in person or at-large after the worship service when church announcements are shared to the congregation. * Church members are encouraged to use Early Modern English (including the familiar second-person forms \\"thee\\" and \\"thou\\" instead of \\"you\\") when petitioning God in public prayer. (Early Modern English is the form of English used in the translation of the King James Version of the Bible.) *Some historical teachings and practices of the Apostolic Christian Church of America have been modified (at least at the denominational level) by its central leadership in recent years, including: ** Change in teaching regarding sins unto death (2013) ** Change in practice regarding restoration of certain excommunicated members (2014) **Merging of missionary activity and funding with the former World Relief organization, renamed \\"Harvest Call\\" (2015) ** Public (online) distribution of brotherhood conference recordings (2016, video including \\"round table\\" discussion added 2020) ** Removal of expectation that men be clean-shaven (2018) ** Increased official acceptance of the use of wedding rings (2018) ** Creation of new songbook including more modern selections (in process, 2019-2020) ** Change in certain roles of women in the church resulting in, among other things, unordained women teaching and preaching in formats other than a formal Sunday service (2019-2020) ** Dissolution of Apostolic Christian Publications board and organization and removal of some of its traditional materials (2019-2020) ** Replacement of Apostolic Christian Publications with new \\"Onward Media\\" organization with paid executive employees (2020) =Church discipline= Church discipline is taken very seriously, and is conducted as is Biblically laid out in Matthew 18:15-17. Members are disciplined out of love. If the member commits a major sin, as the Apostolic Christian Church believes to be laid out by the Bible, he or she will be disciplined. The member will go through a time of reflection and will hopefully repent and come back into fellowship. If there is no repentance, the individual will no longer be considered a member of the ACCA. ACCA members can be disciplined because of sin or because of a lack of adherence to traditions, though in practice, rarely has the latter reason ever been used as a basis of discipline. =Conversion= The conversion experienced for each member varies in timing and detail, but all include repentance for one's sins, making restitution, confessing their sin to God and to people they've sinned against, and finding peace with God and man. The word \\"convert\\" is used throughout the denomination to describe anyone who begins repentance but has not yet been baptized into the church. It does not imply conversion from another denomination or religion, but from the carnal to the spiritual state. Once converts feel they have peace with God, this is announced to the church and a baptism date is set. Converts give a testimony before the members of the church prior to the public baptism service, telling the story of their personal conversion experience. This sharing, commonly referred to as a \\"testimony\\" or \\"proving\\", typically takes place the night before the baptism and is a closed member meeting. Because baptism is identified with a \\"death to sin\\" in Romans 6 and other New Testament writings, congregational recognition of the convert's repentance and death to sin is desired prior to baptism. The baptism service is open for anyone to attend and is performed before the entire congregation. Before the baptism takes place the convert makes a covenant with God in the presence of the entire congregation. Once the covenant is made, the convert is fully immersed in water (unless they are physically unable to do so) representing have sins washed away by the blood of Christ and going under as the old and coming up new. After the baptism service, there is a laying on of hands by one or more elders and an accompanying consecration prayer. This laying on of hands and prayer of consecration is said to place the seal of the Holy Spirit on the life of the newly baptized. =Marriage tradition= *The Apostolic Christian Church marriage tradition heavily involves the church. *The marriage process for members of the ACCA begins when a male member, or sometimes a female member, feels that God has led them to consider marriage. He or she then enters into a time of prayer and seeking Gods will for whom they should marry, taking into account relationships and their individual feelings. They might also seek counsel from those they trust. *As God guides them and as he/she feels peaceful about a specific person, they go to their Elder. After prayer and consideration, the Elder then informs the intended member of the proposal. (If they are from another congregation, the sender's Elder informs the Elder of the recipient's congregation, who then tells them of the proposal.) The recipient then gives the proposal prayer and consideration. *When the recipient feels peace given by God, they relay the answer to there elder, who relays it to the sender. If the answer is \\"No\\", nothing more becomes of the matter and it remains confidential. If the answer is \\"Yes\\", the man and woman are free to tell their immediate family and close friends. However, tradition is to tell no one else until the marriage is announced during the regular Sunday Morning Announcements. *Marriage is encouraged to take place soon (typically within four months) after it is announced. The man and woman are discouraged from spending a lot of time alone until after the marriage ceremony, which takes the place of a Sunday afternoon service. Leadership=Elders= *The leaders of the church, including elders, deacons and ministers, are all male. Females are not allowed to have leadership roles. *Elders of local congregations are ordained by the Elders of the other congregations, usually after a ballot is taken from the local congregation. Elders are usually selected from the current ministers serving in the local church. Elders perform both religious rites and also conduct ministerial duties. *Congregations who do not have a locally residing elder are assigned a \\"Counseling Elder\\" by the national elder body. Day-to-day business in these congregations is handled by a Deacon or \\"Lead Minister\\", depending on the specific situation of each congregation. *The Elders of each congregation serve as equal members within the collective \\"Elder Body\\" of all elders who make decisions regarding the doctrine of the denomination. =Deacons and ministers= *Ministers' duties include preaching in their home congregations and in other congregations. *Ministers (including elders and deacons) do not pursue seminary or other education in preparation for the ministry and serve without compensation. *A Minister who is ordained as a deacon may assist the local or counseling elder with meeting with new converts, performing baptisms, and other duties usually carried out by the elder alone. The ordained deacon only carries out these duties in his home congregation. Most congregations do not have a deacon, rather they are ordained mostly in larger congregations where the elder needs assistance or in smaller congregations where there is no local elder. =Selection of elders, deacons, and ministers= *As a need arises, whether through retirement of a current elder, minister or deacon or through congregational growth, a committee of elders is convened to oversee the selection. *Although it is not a set rule, the typical progression is from Minister to Deacon (if applicable) then to Elder. *After prayer and consideration, the committee addresses the membership of the local congregation in a closed member meeting. The entire congregation will be asked to give the issue prayer and consideration. *After a time of prayer and consideration, the membership of the local congregation will be given opportunity to turn in the name of the person they feel should be given the responsibility in question. If two or three names capture a sizable number of the votes, the elder committee may choose to ask the membership cast ballots again within the confines of those choices. *If no clear choice emerges, the elder committee may choose to table the issue for a time. However, balloting is for advisory purposes only, ballots are destroyed promptly after they are counted and the elder committee has the final responsibility for the appointment. *After a candidate for elder or ordained deacon is selected, he must be interviewed by the elder body at a church conference, typically held semi-annually in February and August. *Upon confirmation, Ministers may assume their role after a time of prayer and meditation. Elders, Deacons, and Ministers have their authorities given to them in a special Ordination Ceremony held in their home congregations.  Locations  Spread throughout the world, churches can be found in several countries. * United States of America, Canada, Mexico, and Japan. * Related congregations (not under the same denominational governance) in Germany, Hungary, Romania, and Ukraine. Along with missionary work, the church also operates several nursing homes, schools, charities and orphanages.

Moreover, the liable of the archaeological heritage of the municipality of Narni, Roberto Nini, has analysed in the year 2006 some samples of mortar taken in the area, determining the connection with the period. Same response has been given by a small equipe of experts on behalf of University of Perugia. recently discovered in Umbria, in the municipality of Narni, inside an artificial channel adjacent the Nera River, about 900 metres down-river from the village of Stifone. Its position is just behind the remains of the river port of the ancient city of Narni. Remains of the shipyard Graphic reconstruction of the shipyard drawn by the artist Alvaro Caponi Remains of the shipyard The shipyard in the local historiography Even before the discovery, following some popular tales handed down through the centuries, it is indicative to note how the local historiography had already mentioned the ancient presence of a similar structure. The former mayor of Narni, Rutilio Robusti, asserted: \\"The origin of the word Stifone comes from the Greek and it has been used to indicate a place where timber boats and rafts were built to be sent towards Rome\\" (Rutilio Robusti, Narni, guida della città e dintorni, 1924) That contribution has been taken up by other authors, as Italo CiaurroCiaurro I., La visita di Benito Mussolini a Terni, 1932 and Guerriero Bolli, both of whom have mentioned the origin of the toponym, the second writing of a shipyard of Stifone although he was thinking of the Byzantine period.Bolli G., Narni, da Odoacre agli Ottoni, 1992 Without any evidence to support the theory, the story of an ancient shipyard was never fully investigated, leaving only a general idea based on a few quotes. With Robusti's contribution, the normal thinking was that the site had perhaps been used for the construction of river rafts for the transportation of people and goods. Once the ruins were actually discovered, it was realized that due to the scale of the works and effort that had gone into building it, it may have been something more. The possibility that it had a connection to the Punic Wars shouldn't be excluded; for this reason, the volunteers who have been working to expand the knowledge of the site are hoping for more attention from archaeologists and public administrations. Being a unique and valuable find, it is important that it be dated as accurately as possible. The potential knowledge that may be gleaned from the site should not be underestimated. The ancient navigability of the Nera River The ancient navigability of the Nera River, as a natural way to send farm produce towards Rome, following the Tiber River in Orte, is confirmed by the classic authors StraboGeographia, Book V, 2, 10. and Tacitus. The Greek geographer refers about \\"not big boats\\"; the Latin historian instead describes in detail the journey of the consul Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso and his wife Plancina who, in the 19, returning to Rome from the provinces of Syria, decided to leave the Via Flaminia and taking a ship at Narni. « Starting from Narni, to avoid suspects or because who fears is uncertain in his plans, he followed the waterway of Nera River and then of Tiber. So he increased the popular grudge because, once landed with the ship at Cesari’s grave, in broad daylight and with riverside full of people, they advanced cheerful in face, him among a crowd of clients and Plancina with her following of women» (Tacitus, Annales, Book III, 9) However, the navigability of the Nera River is related only with the last part of its waterway, included between Stifone and the confluence of Nera with the Tiber. The narrow gorges below Narni, in fact, make impossible this practice. The position of the river port and its rediscovery The geographical coordinates of the ancient river port of Narni were revealed in the 16th century by the Jesuit Fulvio Cardoli, who saw in person its traces. Below his contribute: \\"About one thousand steps beyond Taizzano, there was time once a port along the Nera River, as demonstrated by some traces\\" (F. Cardoli, Ex notis Fulvij Carduli S.J. presbyteri Narniensis de Civitatis Narniae, Origine et antiquatibus).In Giovanni Eroli, Miscellanea Storica Narnese, vol. II, 1862. The river port was found in the same position in the year 1879, when an informer of the marquis Giovanni Eroli noticed the remains of two big pilasters used to fasten the boats.G. Eroli, Osservazioni sopra la lettera del Sig. Ettore Sconocchia intitolata il Navale dei Ternani del Nera, 1879. Remains of the river port With the construction of some dams up stream, and the consequent rise of the river level, the port was tacitly believed as submerged. The remains of it, contrary to popular belief, were however in the same place described by the Jesuit, although hidden among the bushy vegetation. Only in the year 1992 was the port mentioned again in local historiography, when the archaeologist Roberto Nini wrote of the area.Appunti sul territorio narnese, in Archeologia, Gruppo Archeologico Guardese, n. 18, 1992. Some years later, the river port was visited by the superintendent for the regional archaeological heritage, Daniela Monacchi,Iscrizione funeraria dal territorio di Narni, in Epigraphica, Periodico Internazionale di Epigrafia, Vol. LVIII, 1996. but the close presence of an ancient shipyard was not noticed, due to a body of stagnant water which has obstructed the passage. The finding of the shipyard Meanwhile, someone had decided to patrol the channel which hosts the remains of the shipyard, in particular a group of people from the close village of Nera Montoro who knew the old popular story regarding the presence of a similar structure. After perceiving its destination, the local artist Alvaro Caponi has tried to reconstruct the hypothetical functioning producing some sketches, but despite its importance, the discovery has remained without any development. This till the beginning of the new century, when a young free- lance journalist, Christian Armadori, taken to the place by the entrant archaeologist Claudio Maturi with the prospect of an article, has been stunned by the find insomuch as undertaking an appropriate research. Then, in the year 2006, a group of volunteers has established the cultural association Porto di Narni Approdo d'Europa with the aim to put the archaeological site under the attention of the local government, and few time later also the major of Narni, Stefano Bigaroni, has gone to the area in order to check the plausibility of the discovery. The artificial channel with the remains of the shipyard, taken by Giuseppe Fortunati The structure of the shipyard The remains are situated inside an artificial channel dug in the rock, about 280 m long, once united with the Nera River upstream and downstream, as showed by some maps of the land office. It is composed with two opposite cut walls, about 16.5 m apart, which showed a series of squared holes disposed on three lines, for a total of 30 incisions per wall, on the theoretical basis carried out by the artist who has reconstructed its scale drawing (there are only 27 holes still visible). The function of these holes has been supposed to be for inserting lateral props to support and stabilise ships. The fact the holes run for about 13 metres per wall, and considering how the props shouldn’t be necessary for prow and stern (the thinnest parts of the boat), the measures appear quite substantive for simple river rafts, especially with reference to the notable distance between walls. So far, it has seemed more prudent not to speak about Roman quinquereme or trireme without the essential comparisons, especially considering how the historians themselves are not agreed about the exact measures of these warships. However, most of them share similar opinions when they speak about their draft, supposed to be quite moderate,Pastoretto P. e Milizia U. M., Le quinqueremi, 2001, First part, obtained by the website http://www.arsmilitaris.org then potentially suitable to descend along the last stretch of the Nera River, which is very copious of water before to flow into the Tiber River. The reasons of a shipyard quite far from the Tyrrhenian Sea, but however well linked with it through the river way, should be found on the abundance of raw material offered by the Umbrian territory (wood of different quality), with the area of Narni fall under the Roman domination since 299 BC. In add, it is interesting to ascertain how the classical authors of that period didn’t supply clear information about the different position of the navy yard, included Polybius who has been the most important historians of the Punic Wars. The need of safety could be linked with the choice to assemble ships in the up-country, without the risk to be exposed at the potential threats of the enemy from the sea. In fact, the modern historians are in agreement to collocate the ancient navalia inside the city of Rome, in the area of Campus Martius.Coarelli F., Il Campo Marzio dalle origini alla fine della Repubblica, 1997 It means the shipyard of Stifone could be only one of the different structures used at that époque, in whom the imposing effort made by the Romans in the year 261 BC to create their first war fleet is famous. However, it’s right and proper to insist how the hypothesis, although generally shared by the researchers, are at the moment still under assessment. The other finds emerged in the area A series of finds emerged in the surrounding fields had already indicated how in the past an urban settlement was based in the area. In the year 1914 an ancient spa pool was foundGiglioli G. Q., \\"Scoperta di antichità in contrada Campo d’Isola presso la stazione di Nera-Montoro\\", in Notizie degli scavi di antichità comunicate alla R. Accademia dei Lincei, 1914 (the zone is very rich in water springs), while two stones with inscriptions came to light at short distance from the shipyard in the years 1850Eroli G., Miscellanea Storica Narnese, vol. I, 1858 and 1970.Monacchi D., \\"Iscrizione funeraria dal territorio di Narni\\", in Epigraphica, Periodico Internazionale di Epigrafia, Vol. LVIII, 1996 Then, a new proof of the importance of the area in the Roman époque has recently emerged with the discovery of a cistern 25 metres deep, still very close to the archaeological site.Corriere dell'Umbria, 4 May 2007 The ancient importance of that territory in the Roman ages is additionally confirmed by a narration of Livy for the year 207 BC, especially as a strategic point. After having intercepted a correspondence between Hasdrubal and his brother Hannibal, the Roman legions decided to block the passage in proximity of the shipyard area, as it’s clearly deductible by the geographical coordinates provided by the author « Two knights of Narnia were returned from the battle in the camp situated at the entrance of the narrow gorge which opens the way to Umbria » (Livy, Ab urbe condita, XXVII) The narrow gorge which opens the way to Umbria is exactly behind the archaeological area, situated just in proximity of its entrance The non usability of the archaeological area The remains of the shipyard, despite the pleas, are at the moment completely abandoned, with vegetation and stagnant waters to put its partial integrity under the risk of further damages. The area, subjected to the possibility of sudden floods due to the presence of dams located upstream, is under the management of the multinational energetic Endesa Italia, so nobody can get there for guided visits without particular authorizations. In add, the original destination of it has been strongly twisted in the medieval époque, this for the installation of several watermills. Present state of the studies The studies carried out by the free-lance journalist Christian Armadori, with the support of the other volunteers involved in the cultural association as Sara Uffreduzzi and Vittorio Budassi, has eventually been published in February 2012 by an editor specialized in the archeological field, with the endorsement of some experts of the University of Perugia arrived to the place to evaluate the credibility of the hypothesis. The aim of the author is providing an input in order to develop the knowledge of the area and rouse the interest of the scientific community.

It serves as the national university of the country. The main campus, Ciudad Universitaria, is located in the capital of San Salvador, but there are also branches of the university in other Salvadoran cities such as Santa Ana, San Miguel and San Vicente. The university counts with a total of 9 faculties in its main campus and has a student population of more than 50,000.  History  The University of El Salvador was founded on February 16, 1841, by the President Juan Lindo,Miguel Ángel Durán. Historia de la Universidad de El Salvador 1841–1930, Second Edition, Editorial Universitaria, San Salvador, El Salvador, 1975, pp. 21–22. :Para todo espíritu ecuánime y amigo de la verdad histórica, el fundador de nuestra Universidad es don Juan Nepomuceno Fernández Lindo y Zelaya, conocido en la Historia simplemente por Juan Lindo, desde el momento que él fue quien firmó el decreto [legislativo] respectivo que la estableció. :Algunos historiadores nacionales, entre ellos, el Dr. José Antonio Cevallos han querido privar de la gloria que legítimamente pertenece a este hombre, pues, dice, era de carácter apático, despótico y enemigo de la Justicia; que durante su Administración [Pública] disolvió arbitrariamente las Cámaras Legislativas y privó a El Salvador de sus islas en el Golfo de Fonseca: Amapala y Zacate Grande, cediéndolas a Honduras, su Patria. Mas, nosotros no participamos de opinión tan tornadiza ya que, después de todo, no es sino una opinión personal, en pugna abierta con el eterno, elocuente y frío testimonio de los documentos históricos. :Empero, cualesquiera que hayan sido los actos del Dr. Lindo, no podemos negarle el hecho de la fundación porque sea un buen hecho, sí habremos de atribuirle, en cambio, sus hechos malos, vilipendiándolos. Muchas Memorias de Secretarios Universitarios hemos consultado y todos [Sic] afirman, sin pasión, que don Juan Lindo fue el fundador de nuestro Máximo Instituto. Para afirmar que este señor no fundó la Universidad sería preciso hacer desparecer su nombre del pie del decreto [legislativo]. Por otra parte, ¿por qué se afirma que Lindo fue el autor del atentado contra las Cámaras Legislativas y no el General Francisco Malespín que era el verdadero dueño del Poder, desde luego que era el Jefe del Ejército? ¡Ah, eso sería tan absurdo como si dijéramos que el héroe de Arrazola no fue Arce, sino sus oficiales que se batieron como fieras! Por eso, más justo fue el doctor Manuel Gallardo, rector de la universidad en el año de 1859, cuando puso sin rodeo alguno, al pie del escudo universitario que se colocaría en el salón de honor del [Sic] alma máter, esta frase de justo reconocimiento: “Joanes de Lindo erexit MDCCCXLI”. as an initiative of the Gral. Francisco MalespinXochilt Escalante, “Juan Lindo decretó la fundación de la Universidad de El Salvador en su presidencia”, in El Universitario, Época XIII, No. 17, Ciudad Universitaria, February 2011, p. 18. :Lindo y el General Francisco Malespín :El fracaso de la Federación era inminente, pero la fundación de la Universidad se venía aplazando desde antes del año de 1840, la decidida acción del General Francisco Malespín, siendo Presidente, el Licenciado Juan Nepomuceno Lindo, en el propio despacho presidencial el General Malespín exigió la fundación de la Universidad, según escritos de Juan José Cañas, con la frase siguiente: “de aquí no saldré sin el Decreto [Legislativo] tantas veces prometido para la fundación del Colegio y la consiguiente Universidad”. El resultado fue la fundación de la alma máter. and the priest Crisanto Salazar, with the objective of providing a centre for further education for the Salvadoran youth. Throughout much of its existence, the university has had a precarious existence, in the earlier years characterised by lack of governmental support and funding. In the 1950s, the University of El Salvador faced opposition from the authoritarian government of the country and many of the students and university professors were victims of the military repression.Juan Mario Castellanos.

Algunos estudiantes y manifestantes vociferaron consignas injuriosas contra Lemus, su familia y el gobierno militar. Fueron reprimidos por la Policía uniformada y de civil con bombas lacrimógenas y disparos de armas de fuego. Grupos de estudiantes y profesores buscaron refugio en las oficinas centrales de la Universidad, ubicadas de manera provisional en el antiguo edificio del antiguo Colegio Sagrado Corazón, en el viejo centro comercial de la ciudad capital. Las instalaciones fueron allanadas por la policía, vejándose de manera bárbara a estudiantes, empleados y autoridades académicas. El rector, Dr. Napoleón Rodríguez Ruiz, el secretario Dr. Cuéllar Milla y el tesorero del máximo centro de estudios resultaron con golpes y fracturas. Fueron destruidos equipos y archivos. El empleado de la librería universitaria, Mauricio Esquivel, murió a consecuencia de los golpes recibidos en una de las bartolinas de la Policía. […] In the 1970s student uprisings took place. On July 19, 1972, the government of Colonel Arturo Armando Molina intervened at the university to suppress the student uprising with military action.Archivo Digital del Diario Oficial de la Imprenta Nacional de El Salvador, julio-1972, Parte19.pdf During the period of occupation, that extended until the end of 1973, the university campus was occupied by troops. When the university reopened, a campaign against the university community began, accusing it to be a center of Marxist indoctrination. In the following years, hundreds of students, university professors, and university authorities faced government repression,Personajes salvadoreños, Tema 30 de julio de 1975, Memorias del 30 de julio de 1975 and in October 1980, the university's chancellor, Felix Ulloa, was assassinated.Centro de Documentación de la Memoria Histórica: Asesinato del rector de la Universidad de El Salvador, UES Instituto de Derechos Humanos de la UCA: Félix Ulloa: 30 años de impunidad (November 3, 2010) On June 26, 1980, the University was once again occupied by the Armed Forces, having begun a period of four years in exile.Dutriz Hermanos, S.A. de C.V., Documento de La Prensa Gráfica: El Conflicto en El Salvador, San Salvador, El Salvador, 1992, p 30.

In 2008, celebrating the passage of 300 years since the first Petrović Njegoš rulers ascent, Nicholas, Crown Prince of Montenegro, bestowed the Order in recognition of this landmark. The upper arm of the cross bears the Cyrillic initial \\"D\\" that stands for Danilo I - the first Petrović Njegoš Hereditary Bishop - and the lower one \\"N\\" for Nicholas I. The remaining two arms of the cross indicate the date of the first rule by the dynasty and of the foundation of the Order. The Order of Petrović Njegoš is a House Order of the Royal House of Montenegro. The Order consists of a single class.

She was assigned to serve the U.S. Pacific Fleet with her protective anti- submarine nets and earned two battle stars and other commendations for her bravery. Launched in Camden, New Jersey Teak (YN-30) was laid down on 25 October 1940 at Camden, New Jersey, by John H. Mathis & Company; launched on 7 July 1941; sponsored by Mrs. E. L. Patch; placed in service on 7 May 1942; and commissioned on 10 December 1942 at Colon, Panama Canal Zone, Lt. Harl Stanley Day, USNR, in command. World War II service =Coastal protection services= At the time of her commissioning, the net tender was assigned to the nets guarding the west gate of the Panama Canal. Teak transited the canal on 15 December 1942; departed Balboa on Christmas Eve; and arrived at San Francisco, California, on 6 January 1943. Based at Tiburon Naval Net Depot on West San Francisco Bay, she began tending the harbor's antisubmarine nets on the 10th. Throughout 1943 and into 1944, Teak patrolled and maintained the nets which protected the anchorages and harbor of San Francisco Bay. She inspected the nets, repaired and replaced worn parts and buoys, and freed mooring anchors and an occasional ship fouled in the nets. These routine but vital duties were varied by repairs at Alameda, California, with gunnery drills in October, and with a voyage to San Pedro, California, in December. =South Pacific operations= Reclassified a net laying ship and redesignated AN-35 on 20 January 1944, Teak passed under the Golden Gate Bridge shortly before sunset on 2 March and set her course for the South Pacific Ocean. Proceeding via Samoa, she reached New Guinea on 4 April and began operating out of Milne Bay and the nearby Trobriand Islands. For the next six months, she provided towing services in nearby waters, carried cargoes, placed sonar buoys, and took up unneeded buoys and moorings. Reassigned to the Leyte Gulf Service Unit of the U.S. 7th Fleet Service Force, she departed Humboldt Bay in convoy on 18 October and entered Leyte Gulf on the 24th. For the next few weeks, despite frequent calls to general quarters, she laid net moorings and marker buoys in Leyte Gulf, aided grounded small craft, and made tows. Late in November, she began sonar buoy station duties between Samar and Homohon Islands. On 17 January 1945, she returned to tending and laying moorings. In mid-March, she proceeded to Luzon and operated in Manila Bay, primarily occupied in raising submerged barges, sampans, diesel boats, and steamboats. During this period—while assigned to the Ship Salvage, Fire Fighting and Rescue Unit, Service Force, Pacific—she won the Navy Unit Commendation. She remained in the Philippines until late in November, when she headed, via the Mariana Islands and Pearl Harbor, for the California coast and arrived at San Pedro, California on 4 January 1946. She was towed to Astoria, Oregon, by Mimosa (AN-26) in June and was decommissioned and placed in reserve on 30 August 1946. She was placed in custody of the U.S. Maritime Administration in June 1961, but remained under Navy ownership. Teak was sold to Levin Metals Corp., San Jose, California, on 16 March 1976. Honors and awards Teak won two battle stars (Leyte operation and Manila Bay-Bicol operation) plus her share of the Navy Unit Commendation.

Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S. 636 (1975), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court, which unanimously held that the gender-based distinction under of the Social Security Act of 1935—which permitted widows but not widowers to collect special benefits while caring for minor children—violated the right to equal protection secured by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution..  Background  Stephen Wiesenfeld and Paula Polatschek were married in 1970. Stephen ran a minicomputer consulting business and had an irregular income. Paula taught mathematics at Edison High School and earned significantly more than her husband. When Paula died in childbirth from an amniotic embolism, Stephen became the sole provider for their newborn son, Jason. To take care of his son, Stephen cut his work hours and sought child care. Wiesenfeld contested his ineligibility for Social Security survivors' benefits that were made available to widows, but not to widowers. Caspar Weinberger, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (1973-75), appealed the case to the Supreme Court. Rutgers Law School professor Ruth Bader Ginsburg, along with Melvin Wulf, took on Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld after several unfavorable Supreme Court decisions on gender discrimination cases. In 1974, Kahn v. Shevin had upheld differences in property tax exemption between widows and widowers, and the Supreme Court ruled in Geduldig v. Aiello that denying compensation from work loss due to pregnancy did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. Ginsburg looked to Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld to promote the idea of \\"the care of two loving parents, rather than just one.\\" Ginsburg made the argument that Section 402(g) of the Social Security Act discriminated against Stephen Wiesenfeld by not providing him with the same survivors' benefits as it would to a widow. Further, Ginsburg argued that Paula's contributions to Social Security were not treated on an equal basis to salaried men, so she was also being discriminated against.  Decision  Eight of the nine justices voted in favor of Wiesenfeld, with Justice Douglas abstaining from voting. They declared that Section 402(g) of the Social Security Act was unconstitutional on the grounds that the gender based distinctions violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Justice Brennan wrote in the Court's opinion: The Court differentiated the Social Security matter from the decision in Kahn v. Shevin. The court decided that Section 402(g):  Subsequent developments  Wiesenfeld himself received no monetary benefits from the decision. By the time he initiated the case, he had shut down his consulting business and obtained a well-paid position at a computer company. His salary thus exceeded the income cutoff for receiving Social Security benefits. Ginsburg helped highlight the idea that the social security provision had discriminated against men acting as caregivers, and women serving as breadwinners. Brennan ruled that \\"such a gender-based generalization cannot suffice to justify the denigration...of women who do work and whose earnings contribute significantly to their families' support.\\" The decision aimed to establish that it is just as important for a child to be cared for by the male parent, as they will encounter the same difficulties in parenting as the female parent. The court's ruling challenged the traditional male breadwinner/female homemaker model in terms of allocating government benefits. This case gave widowed men the opportunities to collect Social Security for their dependent children, which was only allowed for widowed mothers to collect before this court case. Like men, women could now have their Social Security benefit their families if they died. Though Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld was considered a victory for feminists, the court still was unclear on distinguishing between sex-based classifications that were damaging to women and those that nurtured sexual equality. Gender based social security questions would continue to be explored further in cases such as Califano v. Goldfarb, which Ginsburg was also involved in, and later in Califano v. Webster, for which Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld had helped lay important groundwork.  See also  * Gender equality * List of gender equality lawsuits * Califano v. Goldfarb (1977) * Geduldig v.

Affiliated with the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Thapar was the founder-editor of the monthly journal Seminar, published from New Delhi, India. Personal life and background Thapar was born in Lahore (now in Pakistan) to a Punjabi trading family of the Khatri caste. He was the brother of Romila Thapar, the historian. General Pran Nath Thapar, sometime Chief of Army Staff, was his paternal uncle (father's brother), and the journalist Karan Thapar is his paternal first cousin. Thapar was also related distantly to the family of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Nehru's niece, the writer Nayantara Sahgal, was married to Gautam Sahgal, brother of Bimla Thapar, wife of Pran Nath Thapar. Thapar's family was newly wealthy, having made their fortune in trade during World War I, as commission agents for the colonial British Indian Army. Thapar was therefore sent to England for his education. Fabian socialism, which was fashionable in the universities of England in the years between the two world wars, had a deep impact on Thapar at a young age. Starting as a fashionable socialist, Thapar developed into a Marxist ideologue over the years, and remained a member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) until his death. Career Thapar returned to India in the mid-1940s and took a job in Bombay as a journalist with The Times of India, while Frank Moraes was its editor. After a couple of years, Thapar used some of his family wealth to start an English language magazine of his own, named Cross Roads. The magazine, which was published monthly, offered views rather than news, and combined high-brow intellectualism with communist ideology. It never gained much circulation, but this did not bother Thapar, who regarded it as an interesting occupation and not as a source of livelihood. =Seminar= On 1 September 1959, Thapar started Seminar as a monthly journal, with a fund of Rs 11,000. This time, he sought to establish a stable revenue model through subscribers and advertisers. Seminar continues to be published from Malhotra building in Connaught Place, Delhi. The publication is brought out by Thapar's daughter Malavika Singh and her husband Tejbir Singh, who is the editor. In 2009, the publication celebrated its 50th anniversary. =Other party activities= During his years in Bombay, Thapar was associated with IPTA, the theatre wing of the CPM He was involved in story formulation and script writing for their films inspired by communist ideology. He also acted bit roles in two Hindi film, being Footpath (1953) directed by Zia Sarhadi and Merchant Ivory's debut film, The Householder (1963). Before the advent of television, he also did the commentary in the monthly news-reels produced by Films Division, which were shown in cinema halls prior to the screening of films. =Political clout= Thapar and his wife grew especially close to Indira Gandhi through the 1960s and 1970s. Although he had known her earlier, it was after Nehru's death that Thapar became a part of the inner circle of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, along with politicians like Dinesh Singh. This connection brought Thapar significant clout in society and government, and numerous sinecures were showered on him as patronage. Thapar served at various times as director of the India International Centre, of the National Books Development Board, of the India Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC), and as vice-chairperson of the National Bal Bhavan, Delhi (1967–1974), all of which are government sinecures conferred on him by successive Congress party governments. However, during the Emergency of 1975, Thapar was marginalized by the Gandhis (Indira and Sanjay) for not being \\"supportive\\" enough. With the loss of political clout, his social standing waned and he had to limit himself to journalism. Personal life In 1945, Thapar married Raj Malhotra (1925–87), who also hailed from a Punjabi Khatri family of Lahore. The couple lived in a flat in Mafatlal Park, in the upmarket Breach Candy neighbourhood of Mumbai, and were notable mainly for being well-connected socialites. They had a son named Valmik and a daughter named Malavika. Thapar's son, Valmik Thapar, is a prominent tiger conservationist. He is married to occasional actress Sanjana Kapoor, daughter of bollywood actor Shashi Kapoor by his actress wife Jennifer Kendal, an Indian of British heritage. Valmik and Sanjana are the parents of a son, Hamir Thapar. Thapar's daughter, Malavika Singh, who now runs the Seminar magazine, is married to Tejbir Singh, who edits the magazine. Tejbir Singh is the nephew of writer Khushwant Singh and grandson of the construction magnate Sir Sobha Singh. Malavika and Tejbir have a son, Jaisal Singh, who runs as many as five wildlife resorts (the \\"Sujan\\" chain of boutique properties) in Rajasthan. He is married to Anjali Anand, only child and heiress of Deep C. Anand, founder of the Anand group of companies which had a turnover of Rs. 6100 crore in 2014-15.Anjali, her father's heir Anjali is being groomed to take over the business empire built by her father; she has also been instrumental in the meteoric expansion of her husband's wildlife resort venture. Jaisal and Anjali are the parents of twins born in 2012. Raj Thapar died in 1987 of cancer, at the age of 61. Romesh Thapar died a few months later. A few years later, Raj Thapar's memoir, All These Years was completed, edited and published by her daughter Malvika Singh in 1991. It was based on her diary which she had kept over two decades.

The Coopersville Area Historical Society and Museum is now housed in the station. History The Grand Rapids, Grand Haven and Muskegon Railway was incorporated in 1899, and began service in 1902 on 44 miles of interurban line. This station in Coopersville was constructed for the opening of the line. The trans were electric, and the station functioned as not only a passenger depot, but also an electric substation to supply DC power to the trains via an electrified third rail. (Note: large pdf file) In 1912, the United Light and Railway Company bought out the Grand Rapids, Grand Haven and Muskegon Railway. They operated the railway until 1928. The company held only an easement on the property, so when United Light went out of business, the property reverted to the city of Coopersville. A local garden club used the property from the 1930s through at least the early 1970s. After this, it was used by the Coopersville Public School System as an alternative education site. In 1987, the Coopersville Area Historical Society acquired use of the building. They opened the building as a museum, and made renovations, completed in 1991. Description The Grand Rapids, Grand Haven & Muskegon Railway depot in Coopersville is a single-story red brick building with an attached tower and a red clay tile roof. The building was used both as a passenger waiting room and as an electrical substation where AC power was converted to DC to power the train cars. The electrical machinery was located in the tower, and was connected by a cable to railway power lines. The openings originally for the cable are still visible on the tower. The remainder of the building was used as a passenger waiting room and to handle freight shipments.

Together with his friend Frederick Bagot who was to become editor of the local paper in Middleton, Wiggins initiated a campaign that ended with Brasenose College, Oxford (which had run the school under the terms laid down by Queen Elizabeth I) handing over many thousands of pounds, which helped towards the building of the new school in Durnford Street, when the administration became vested in the Lancashire County Council.Active behind the scenes - News - Middleton Guardian at www.middletonguardian.co.uk Member of Parliament and the Oldham by-election, 1925 Wiggins entered Parliament at a by-election in 1925 at Oldham. The election was occasioned by the appointment of the sitting Liberal MP, Edward Grigg (a former private secretary to David Lloyd George) to the governorship of Kenya. Oldham was a two-member seat at the time. Wiggins had fought beside Grigg at the 1923 general election but the second seat had been retained by William Tout the Labour candidate and MP since 1922 and private secretary to the Minister of Labour. In the 1924 general election Tout lost his seat to the Tory candidate Duff Cooper. Wiggins, described as a staunch free-trader and robust Radical was selected as Liberal candidate and Tout was invited to stand again by the Oldham Trades and Labour Council. The Tories were in a difficult spot concerning a possible candidate for the by-election. Oldham Liberals had decided not to put up a second candidate at the 1924 general election, ensuring Duff Cooper was elected on the back of Liberal votes. The local parties also had a written agreement not to engage in three-cornered fights at municipal elections and putting up a by-election candidate put these arrangements at risk. In addition, Wiggins proposed to make the Budget, free- trade and the question of duties on silk products the principal issue of the election. He was expected to receive support from many Conservative supporters of free-trade who were also opposed to silk and artificial silk duties. In the event the Tories chose not to put up a candidate but Wiggins emphatically denied that any pact had been arranged between the parties. It just seems that the Conservatives did not wish to risk handing the seat back to Labour and ruining their local government arrangements with the Liberals. The Liberals played to this with Conservative minded voters in the campaign, with Lloyd George declaring at a speech in Oldham that the issue was about socialism and raising the spectre of Tout's record of supporting the state ownership of many industries. The free-trade issue was also a continuing feature of the election with Sir Alfred Mond, still at that time a Liberal but to defect to the Tories in 1926, delivering a speech on the subjectThe Times, 6.6.25 and on 13 June in the Committee on the Finance Bill, the silk duties were carried,The Times, 13.6.25 providing ammunition for Wiggins’ campaign. Wiggins won the by- election with a majority of 4,623 over Tout in a poll where turnout was 66% and in his acceptance speech freely acknowledged the wholehearted support of Liberals and Conservatives against Socialism.The Times, 25.6.25 Stepping down from Parliament When the Oldham Liberals decided to contest both seats at the general election of 1929, Wiggins felt this undermined the tacit understanding the party had with the Conservatives and he declined to stand for re-election.The Times, 18.5.29 He may also have felt the winds of political change coming in Oldham and decided to jump before he was pushed as the Labour party gained both Oldham seats in the 1929 general election. Cotton interests After he retired from Parliament, Wiggins continued to play a leading public role in representing the cotton manufacturing industry and the development of practices in the field. But apart from his fierce defence of the interests of the Lancashire cotton trade, it is sometimes difficult to find a consistent policy thread in his public utterances and recommendations. In 1931 he headed a delegation to lobby the President of the Board of Trade, William Graham and the Secretary of State for India, William Wedgwood Benn on the prospects for the cotton trade with India.The Times, 14.3.31 In 1934, as chairman of the special committee appointed by Federation of Master Cotton Spinners Associations he produced a report into the management and policies of the cotton trade starting from research into the problems of silver from the point of view of the Lancashire Cotton trade.The Times, 20.2.34 His report condemned British economic policy in contracting the money supply and the demonetization of silver and praised the actions of US President Franklin D Roosevelt in taking positive government action to intervene in financial and fiscal matters. He proposed restoring international trade through rising prices, guaranteed by government action. In Rome in the spring of 1935 he represented his industry at the World Cotton Congress and presented a paper on silver in relation to monetary policy and the cotton trade of the world. On this occasion he took the opportunity to promote a free trade agenda and to attack the idea that nations could isolate themselves or attempt to practice autarky.The Times, 3.5.35 The Congress was not however ready for all Wiggins’ solutions and he was obliged to withdraw his call for rises in the price of silver to ensure unity between the delegations and this time supported the call for the United States Board of Agriculture to intervene more robustly to counter some of the practices of American cotton manufacturers and traders.The Times, 6.5.35 Later in 1935, Wiggins met the prime minister of Australia, Joseph Lyons with other local businessmen in Manchester to object formally to Australia's tariff regimes against Lancashire cotton goods.The Times, 13.6.35 In early 1936, Wiggins spoke in favour of the Cotton Spinning Bill then before Parliament saying that people needed to recognise that the days of laissez-faire were over and defended elements of state regulation in the industry to keep production up and employment in the industry high. In 1938, against the background of the trade recession, in his capacity as chairman of the Monetary Policy Committee of his Federation, he wrote to the Times newspaper advocating a national monetary system to protect British interests against the policies of foreign governments.The Times, 31.8.38 Then in 1939, Wiggins was a member of a deputation to the prime minister Neville Chamberlain, President of the Board of Trade Oliver Stanley and Minister of Labour, Ernest Brown to make representations about the depression in the cotton industry. The delegation called for special measures to protect the industry and give government assistance to Lancashire to help overcome the economic and social effects of the depression. They blamed the subsidies given to foreign cotton manufacturers by their governments and the tariffs and trade barriers erected by foreign governments.The Times, 25.1.39 It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that Wiggins was for free trade when it benefited Lancashire cotton and against it when circumstances changed. After the War, Wiggins served as one of the employers’ representatives on the Cotton Working Party set up in October 1945 which proposed a comprehensive programme for the re-equipment and reorganisation of the industry with government help and finance but stopping short of a request for nationalisation.The Times, 28.5.46 He died in 1950.

The museum features exhibitions drawn from the collections of the government archives and aims to provide document-based perspective on France’s history and the evolution of French society. It is housed in the Hôtel de Soubise in the Marais neighborhood in the 3rd arrondissement of Paris, France. It was first established under Napoleon III in 1867 with the direction of Léon de Laborde. History After undergoing centuries of renovation, this turret from the 14th century is the only remaining piece of the Hôtel de Clisson which served as the beginning for the Hôtel de Soubise. It now houses the Musée des Archives Nationales. The Hôtel de Soubise was first built in 1371 as the Hôtel de Clisson and later acquired by the Ducs de Guise. In 1705, it was rebuilt by architect Pierre-Alexis Delamair (1676–1745) for François de Rohan-Soubise and Anne-de Rohan Chabot, with little remaining of the original structure but its turreted medieval gateway which is now the only surviving remnant of Parisian private architecture from the 14th century (see image). The adjoining Hôtel de Rohan was built at the same time. In 1808 both buildings were acquired by the state, after which Napoleon designated the Hôtel de Soubise for the Empire Archives and the Hôtel de Rohan as the National Printing House (which so remained until 1927). Léon de Laborde, an archeologist and prolific author documenting artists, museum collections, and French history, served as the General Director of the Empire Archives from March 1857 to April 1868. He was chiefly responsible for setting up the museum relating to the archive collections. The museum officially opened on July 19, 1867 after de Laborde spent years collecting and selecting documents, then developing a classification and numbering system. Operations and collections The museum has both a permanent exhibition and rotating special exhibitions, which not only highlight the holdings of the Archives Nationales but also provide history on archival processes. The collection has objects dating back to the first century A.D. De Laborde developed the classification and numbering system for the collection, most of which are still in use: * AE I: (the Armoire de fer) This \\"iron chest\\" houses many of the most treasured documents, like Napoleon I's testament, the Journal of Louis XVI and French constitutions. * AE II: Museum of French documents, including one of the oldest documents held in the Archives, a parchment from King Childebert III granting land to the Abbey of Saint-Denis (see image).One of the oldest records in the Archives nationales: parchment dated December 23, 695. King Childebert III rules that the land of Hodenc-l'Évêque (Oise) belongs to the Abbey of Saint-Denis. * AE III: Museum of foreign documents. This includes items such as correspondence between King Henry III of England and King Louis IX of France (see image).A letter from King Henry III of England to King Louis IX of France dated 16 October, 1263. * AE V: Incriminating evidence and seized items, including case documents like that against Robert-François Damiens for his assassination attempt of King Louis XV of France. * AE VI: Historic objects, such as ancient city keys and objects from the Hôtel de Soubise and Hôtel de Rohan from when they were residences. AE IV, which was used for Sigillographic collections, no longer exists as it was eventually built into its own separate collection outside the Museum. Architecture and decor An image of the Salon ovale de la princesse in the Hôtel de Soubise. The Hôtels de Soubise and de Rohan have exterior architecture in the Baroque style, with rooms throughout in the Rococo style, including the Chambre du prince, Salon ovale du prince, Chambre d'apparat de la princesse, an amusing Cabinet des singes (Monkey Cabinet), and the fine Salon ovale de la princesse with featuring gilt and crystal decor and ceiling frescoes by François Boucher, Charles-Joseph Natoire, and Carle Van Loo (see image).

They can denote either individual or team accomplishments. History ESPN says the practice of awarding helmet stickers is often wrongly credited to Ernie Biggs, also an athletic trainer at Ohio State under legendary coach Woody Hayes. They instead claim that the practice of awarding stickers began with Jim Young, former assistant coach at Miami in 1965, two years before they were used by the Buckeyes. An even earlier attribution is given to Gene Stauber, freshman coach at Nebraska (1955–1957) by head coach Pete Elliott.http://www.huskermax.com/interviews/Pete_Elliott.html Stauber routinely used stickers throughout his tenure as assistant coach at Illinois (1960–1970), as a 1962 photo of All-American linebacker Dick Butkus indicates. The stickers stem from fighter pilots marking their planes with stickers or painted roundels after kills and/or successful missions. Michael Pellowski, in his book Rutgers Football: A Gridiron Tradition in Scarlet, credits Rutgers defensive backs coach Dewey King with being “one of the first” to award decals for helmets in 1961. The stickers were given for interceptions only so they were more difficult to earn. Every time there was an interception, the crowd yelled “give him the star.” The stars can be seen in this photo of the 1961 team walking from the locker room to the field prior to the season finale against Columbia.

He became a commissioned officer a year after having joined the Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 151 in 1910. Parschau was trained as a pilot in Johannisthal, Darmstadt, and in Hanover and received his licence on 4 July 1913. World War I Upon the outbreak of hostilities in August 1914 Parschau was already serving with the Luftstreitkräfte, and soon found himself flying two-seaters in operations on the Champagne front and then in Flanders and Alsace-Lorraine before being posted to West Prussia and Galicia, on the Eastern Front. =The Green Machine (A.16/15)= Close-up photo of Otto Parschau's \\"green machine\\", armed with a synchronized Parabellum MG14 machine gun in May 1915, essentially the Fokker Eindecker \\"prototype\\". Parschau was assigned the Fokker A.III aircraft bearing both the Fokker factory serial number 216 and the IdFlieg military serial number of A.16/15. This airplane had previously been flown by Oberleutnant Waldemar von Buttlar. This unarmed monoplane had been privately purchased in 1913 by von Buttlar. It was requisitioned by the Fliegertruppe and von Buttlar was commissioned as an officer in the German Army at the outbreak of hostilities. The airplane was painted in a shade of green that was the same as that used by von Buttlar's previous Marburg-based Jäger Regiment 11. Parschau had served with the same, Brieftauben-Abteilung Ostende unit, abbreviated as BAO in German military communications of the time, in Belgium as Oberleutnant von Buttlar did in November 1914, where the two German officers could have first made contact. As A.16/15 still bore the green color of von Buttlar's old unit, the aircraft became distinctive as Parschau's 'Green Machine', right from the outbreak of World War I. Parschau flew this machine on a roving commission for nearly a year, serving with FFAs 22 and 42 and the aforementioned \\"BAO\\" unit, which was actually a group of four FFA units operating as one for the Oberste Heeresleitung or OHL, the World War I German Army's High Command office. In this period, Parschau flew his distinctive machine on the Champagne front during October and November 1914. Following this were periods in Flanders and Alsace-Lorraine before Parschau was posted first to West Prussia and then on to Galicia on the Eastern Front. His travels were marked on the Fokker's fuselage. In late May 1915, this airplane was the first one to be fitted with a workable synchronization gear: the Fokker Stangensteuerung synchronizer, along with a Parabellum MG 14 machine gun for its armament. This airplane functioned as the prototype Fokker Eindecker for Parschau's use and combat evaluation. Otto Parschau's Fokker M.5K/MG (Fokker factory no. \\"191\\") with IdFlieg serial E.1/15, the very first series-built Fokker Eindecker ever produced, shown with \\"lowered\\" wing mount location. =Later war service= Because Parschau was recognised as an experienced and proficient pilot, he was selected to go to Feldflieger Abteilung 62 (FFA 62) at Douai as an instructor on monoplanes. Feldflieger Abteilung (Field Flying Company) was the title of the pioneering German field aviation units. The FFAs were organized under the Fliegertruppe. By October 1916, the Fliegertruppe had evolved into the Luftstreitkräfte, the air service of the German army. (The German navy had their own air service, the Marine-Fliegerabteilung.) Amongst Parschau's students at FFA 62 were the notable pioneer German flying aces, Max Immelmann and Oswald Boelcke. Despite his earlier complaints of his Parabellum machine gun jamming, he managed to reel off a string of six victories over enemy airplanes between 11 October 1915The Aerodrome Forum and 2 July 1916 as part of the Fokker Scourge. On 3 July 1916, he shot down an enemy observation balloon. In July 1916 he transferred to FFA 32, gaining his 8th victory on 9 July 1916. He was awarded the Pour le Merite the following day.http://www.pourlemerite.org/ Retrieved on 26 April 2010. On the 14th, AKN was severed from FFA 32 and Parschau was appointed to its command. On 21 July 1916 Parschau was mortally wounded during combat with the Royal Flying Corps over Grévillers. The fatal wound was to the chest; he also suffered a glancing bullet wound to the head, possibly from rounds fired by John Oliver Andrews. He retained enough control to land his plane behind German lines. He was rushed to a field hospital but died on the operating table. Notes=References= *van Wyngarden, G.

Carolina Coach Company, 64 MCC 769 (1955) is a landmark civil rights case in the United States in which the Interstate Commerce Commission, in response to a bus segregation complaint filed in 1953 by a Women's Army Corps (WAC) private named Sarah Louise Keys, broke with its historic adherence to the Plessy v. Ferguson separate but equal doctrine and interpreted the non- discrimination language of the Interstate Commerce Act as banning the segregation of black passengers in buses traveling across state lines.Barnes, Catherine A. New York: Columbia University Press. 1983. Journey from Jim Crow: The Desegregation of Southern Transit, p. 99-100 The case was filed on the eve of the explosion of the Civil Rights Movement by Washington, D.C., lawyer Julius Winfield Robertson and his partner, Dovey Johnson Roundtree, a former WAC whose experience with Jim Crow bus travel during her World War II Army recruiting days caused her to take on the case as a personal mission.McCabe, Katie, Washingtonian, March 2002, pp. 124-125McCabe and Roundtree, Justice Older than the Law Keys v. Carolina Coach Company, along with its companion train desegregation case, NAACP v. St. Louis-San Francisco Railway Company, 298 ICC 355 (1955), represents a milestone in the legal battle for civil rights. The November 1955 ruling, publicly announced six days before Rosa Parks' historic defiance of state Jim Crow laws on Montgomery buses,Barnes, p. 108 applied the United States Supreme Court's logic in Brown v. Board of Education (347 US 483 (1954) for the first time to the field of interstate transportation, and closed the legal loophole that private bus companies had long exploited to impose their own Jim Crow regulations on black interstate travelers.Barnes, pp. 98-100 Keys v. Carolina Coach was the only explicit rejection ever made by either a court or a federal administrative body of the Plessy v. Ferguson doctrine (Plessy, 163 US 537 (1896)) in the field of bus travel across state lines.Barnes, pp. 86-107 The ruling made legal history both at the time of its issuance and again in 1961, when Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy invoked it in his successful battle to end Jim Crow travel during the Freedom Riders' campaign.Petition for Rule Making to the ICC, Attorney General of the US, May 29, 1961  Background  Roanoke Rapids bus terminal, shown with a Carolina Trailways bus, in a postcard from the North Carolina State Archives The Keys case originated in an incident that occurred at a bus station in the North Carolina town of Roanoke Rapids shortly after midnight on August 1, 1952, when African American WAC private Sarah Keys was forced by a local bus driver to yield her seat in the front of the vehicle to a white Marine as she traveled homeward on furlough.Barnes, Journey from Jim Crow, p. 87, citing ICC ruling in Keys v. Carolina Coach, 64 MCC 769 (1955) At the time of the incident, Jim Crow laws entirely governed Southern bus travel, despite a 1946 Supreme Court ruling meant to put an end to the practice. That decision, Morgan v. Virginia (328 US 373 (1946)), had declared state Jim Crow laws inoperative on interstate buses on the basis that the imposition of widely varying statutes on black passengers moving across state lines generated multiple seat changes and thus created the kind of disorder and inconsistency forbidden by the commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution.Barnes, pp. 44-51 Southern carriers managed to dodge the Morgan decision, however, by passing segregation rules of their own, and those rules remained outside the purview of state and federal courts because they pertained to private businesses.Barnes, pp. 52-53 In addition, the federal agency charged with regulating the carriers, the Interstate Commerce Commission, had historically interpreted the Interstate Commerce Act's discrimination ban as permitting separate accommodations for the races so long as they were equal.Barnes, pp. 6-7, pp. 21-28, pp. 67-71 The ICC's separate but equal policy, upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in a 1950 railway dining car segregation case known as Henderson v. United States (399 US 816 (1950)), thus remained the norm in public transportation.Barnes, pp. 75-81 When Sarah Keys departed her WAC post in Fort Dix, New Jersey on the evening of July 31, 1952 bound for her hometown of Washington, North Carolina, she boarded an integrated bus in New Jersey and transferred without incident in Washington, D.C. to a Carolina Trailways vehicle, taking the fifth seat from the front in the white section. When her bus pulled into the Roanoke Rapids Trailways terminal, however, a new driver took the wheel and demanded that she comply with the carrier's Jim Crow regulation by moving to the so- called \\"colored section\\" in the back of the bus so that a white Marine could occupy her seat. Keys refused to move, whereupon the driver emptied the bus, directed the other passengers to another vehicle, and barred Keys from boarding it. An altercation ensued and Keys was arrested, charged with disorderly conduct, jailed incommunicado overnight, then convicted of the disorderly conduct charge and fined $25.Keys v. Carolina Coach Company, 64 MCC 769 (1955) Unwilling to accept the verdict of the North Carolina lower court sustaining the charge, Keys and her father brought the matter to the attention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) office in Washington, D.C., headed by Howard University Law School professor Frank D. Reeves. Reeves referred Keys' case to his former law student Dovey Johnson Roundtree, whose World War II service in the Women's Army Corps (WAC) he believed would make her an ideal advocate for Sarah Keys.McCabe and Roundtree, Justice Older than the Law Roundtree herself, as a recruiter for the WAC in the Deep South, had been evicted from a Miami, Florida bus in a 1943 incident that almost exactly paralleled Sarah Keys' experience.McCabe, Washingtonian, p. 124Greenberg, Milton, The GI Bill, p. 103 She and her law partner and mentor Julius Winfield Robertson undertook the case, filing a complaint against both the Northern carrier which had transported Keys to Washington, D.C., and the Southern carrier which had actually perpetrated the alleged wrong, Carolina Trailways.McCabe and Roundtree, Justice Older than the Law Though Robertson and Roundtree were but a year at the bar in the fall of 1952 when they undertook to represent Sarah Keys, they had been trained at Howard University Law School by such renowned civil rights lawyers as Thurgood Marshall, James Nabrit Jr., and George E.C. Hayes, and they were deeply involved in the movement to dismantle segregation in the courts.McCabe and Roundtree, Justice Older than the Law Writing years later in her autobiography about the unique bond she had with her client, Dovey Roundtree said, \\"It was as though I sat looking in a mirror, so strong was my sense of having walked where Sarah Keys had walked.\\"  Three-year battle  Keys' co-counsel Dovey Johnson Roundtree (1994 photo) The match of client Sarah Keys with the young firm of Robertson and Roundtree proved fortuitous, as did the timing of the case, which unfolded during the same two-year period that the Supreme Court of the United States was hearing oral arguments in the landmark school desegregation case, Brown v. Board of Education.McCabe, pp. 124-125Barnes, pp.92-94 When the US District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed the Keys complaint on February 23, 1953 on jurisdictional grounds, Roundtree and Robertson elected to bring their case before the Interstate Commerce Commission, which they believed might be persuaded to re-evaluate its traditional interpretation of the Interstate Commerce Act, in the same way that the Supreme Court was then re-evaluating its interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment.McCabe, p. 125Barnes, pp. 87-96 On September 1, 1953, two months before Thurgood Marshall and his legal team made the second round of oral arguments in Brown before the Supreme Court asserting that the Fourteenth Amendment's \\"equal protection\\" clause prohibited segregation, Sarah Keys became the first black petitioner to bring a complaint before the Commission on a Jim Crow bus matter.Barnes, p. 87 When the Supreme Court handed down its epochal ruling on May 17, 1954 in Brown v. Board of Education, the ICC initially chose to ignore it. In a September 30, 1954 ruling, ICC hearing examiner Isadore Freidson stated that Brown had no relevance to the conduct of business by a private bus carrier. Citing Plessy v. Ferguson as well as 19th- century ICC decisions handed down prior to Plessy, and others which the Supreme Court had later overturned, Freidson argued that the non- discrimination language of the Interstate Commerce Act did not prohibit segregation.Report and Order Recommended by Isadore Freidson, Examiner, Sept. 30, 1954\\"ICC Examiner's Ruling Favors Jimcrow Bias,\\" Daily Worker, September 30, 1954 Roundtree, through a Spelman classmate who lived in Sarah Keys' Congressional district, contacted Congressman Adam Clayton Powell to protest Freidson's ruling and demand a re-hearing by the full 11-man Commission. Following Powell's intervention, the re-hearing was granted, and Roundtree and Robertson were given 30 days to file exceptions. In those exceptions, the lawyers invoked both the commerce clause of the US Constitution and the Supreme Court's reasoning in Brown and applied it explicitly to the area of transportation.\\"Exceptions to Proposed Report and Order,\\" Robertson and Roundtree to the ICC, October 19, 1954McCabe and Roundtree, Justice Older than the Law On November 7, 1955, in a historic ruling, the Commission condemned 'separate but equal' in the field where it had begun—public transportation. In the Keys case, and in the NAACP's companion train case attacking segregation on railroads and in terminal waiting rooms, NAACP v. St. Louis-Santa Fe Railway Company, the ICC ruled that the Interstate Commerce Act prohibited segregation itself.Barnes, p. 98 The Keys decision, made public just one week before Rosa Parks' defiance of the bus segregation laws of the city of Montgomery,Barnes, p. 108 banned segregation itself as an assault upon the personhood of black travelers, and held in part: \\"We conclude that the assignment of seats on interstate buses, so designated as to imply the inherent inferiority of a traveler solely because of race or color, must be regarded as subjecting the traveler to unjust discrimination, and undue and unreasonable prejudice and disadvantage...We find that the practice of defendant requiring that Negro interstate passengers occupy space or seats in specified portions of its buses, subjects such passengers to unjust discrimination, and undue and unreasonable prejudice and disadvantage, in violation of Section 216 (d) of the Interstate Commerce Act and is therefore unlawful.\\"Keys v. Carolina Coach Company, 64 MCC 769 (1955)  Enforcement  Hailed by the press as a \\"symbol of a movement that cannot be held back,\\"Lerner, New York Post, November 28, 1955 the Keys case marked a turning point in the legal battle against segregation, and a major departure from the ICC's history in racial matters. In the short term, however, it lay dormant, its intent thwarted by the one ICC commissioner who had dissented from the majority opinion, South Carolina Democrat J. Monroe Johnson.Barnes, pp. 99-100 In his position as Chairman of the Commission, Johnson consistently failed to enforce the Keys ruling, and it was not until the summer of 1961, when the violence resulting from the Freedom Riders' campaign prompted Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy to take action, that the impact of the Keys case was felt. Impelled by the protests of civil rights leaders and the weight of international outrage at the brutality perpetrated on the Freedom RidersBarnes, pp. 168-169 Kennedy took the unusual legal step of issuing a petition to the Interstate Commerce Commission on May 29, 1961, in which he called upon them to implement their own rulings. Citing the Keys and NAACP train case, along with the Supreme Court's 1960 Boynton v. Virginia ruling (364 US 454 (1960)) prohibiting segregation in terminal waiting rooms, restaurants and restrooms, the Attorney General called upon the ICC to issue specific regulations banning Jim Crow in interstate travel, and to take immediate steps to enforce those regulations.\\"Petition for Rule-Making,\\" Attorney General to ICC, ICC Docket No. MC-C-3358, May 29, 1961Barnes, p. 169  Historical perspective  A major breakthrough in the legal battle for civil rights, Keys v. Carolina Coach Company has generally been eclipsed in historical accounts of the movement by the events which followed it, notably the defiance of Montgomery, Alabama's city bus laws by Rosa Parks and the resultant Montgomery bus boycott. Parks' action assumed an importance far beyond the level of a municipal incident, giving rise to a Supreme Court decision banning segregation in travel within the individual states (Browder v. Gayle, 352 US 903 (1956)) and igniting the civil rights campaign which thrust the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. onto the national stage and paved the way for further reforms.Barnes, pp. 108-131 The protest movement King led created an environment in which Keys and other desegregation rulings could be implemented. Keys thus represents one critical piece in the complex and multi- faceted fight for civil rights, in which the legal and the activist streams sustained each other and in combination precipitated the dismantling of Jim Crow.
