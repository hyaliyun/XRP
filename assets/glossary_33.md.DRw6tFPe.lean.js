This aircraft extends and increases shipboard sensor and weapon capabilities against several types of enemy threats, including submarines of all types, surface ships, and patrol craft that may be armed with anti-ship missiles. It was originally developed for the United States Navy in 1980s as a reengined version of the older Kaman SH-2 Seasprite. The SH-2G's primary missions include anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare, anti-ship missile defense, and anti-ship surveillance and targeting. Secondary missions may include medical evacuation, search and rescue, personnel and cargo transfer, as well as small boat interdiction, amphibious assault air support, gun fire spotting, mine detection and battle damage assessment. Design and development A US Navy SH-2G in 1995 In 1985, the SH-2G program was started. The US Navy wanted better anti-submarine capabilities and felt upgrading current helicopters would be a more cost-effective approach; moreover legacy Knox-class and early \\"short-hull\\" Perry-class frigates operating the SH-2F could not operate the larger SH-60B Seahawk. The prototype YSH-2G first flew on 2 April 1985. The prototype was a modified SH-2F fitted with two more powerful General Electric T700-GE-401/401C engines.Eden 2004, p. 219. The G-model has a reinforced upper fuselage to support the new, heavier engines. The SH-2G also has multifunctional displays and new avionic systems. The Navy began receiving Airborne Mine Counter Measures (AMCM) hardware with the Kaman Magic Lantern laser mine detection system in December 1996. The US Navy's final production order of the SH-2F was in Fiscal Year 1986 with the last six orders switched to the SH-2G variant. Operational history=Australia= A SH-2G(A) in 2005 In the 1990s, the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) decided that it needed an intermediate helicopter to operate from the s and the planned offshore patrol vessel (OPV); a proposed cooperative project with Malaysia, however, due to its size, the OPV could only operate a small helicopter. In 1997, the Australian Government signed a A$667 million contract with Kaman to purchase 11 upgraded Super Seasprites. By 2005, up to 40 deficiencies in the helicopter had been identified, including the inability to operate in bad weather and low-light conditions, and its failure to meet Australian airworthiness standards. The helicopters were initially restricted to transport duties during good weather before being grounded in May 2006. By early 2007, ten Super Seasprites had been delivered to 805 Squadron. In February 2007, The Australian announced that the Seasprite project was \\"almost certain to be scrapped\\". At this point, the project was six years over schedule and its cost had grown to A$1.1 billion, with an additional A$45 million forecast as required for further upgrades. If approved the squadron would still not reach operational status until 2010. The sale or scrapping of the fleet was under consideration, possible replacements included the NHIndustries NH90 or further orders of Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawks. On 25 May 2007, The Age reported the government would continue to support the Seasprite; Defence Minister Brendan Nelson commented that progress on the project was being closely monitored. Following the election of the new Labor government, The Australian reported on 31 January 2008 that the SH-2G(A) program was likely to be canceled due to cost overruns; additionally it was still not operational despite the original contract being signed in 1997. The same article also noted that Sikorsky had submitted an offer of several 'off the shelf' helicopters to replace Australia's SH-2G(A)s. On 5 March 2008, the project was canceled by the government; Kaman noted the project's end \\"on mutually agreed terms\\".\\"Australia Scraps Super Seasprite Program\\". Rotor & Wing, 5 March 2008. Opposition parties also supported the decision to cancel. The remaining aircraft were returned to Kaman.\\"Kaman Takes SH-2G to Eastern Europe\\". Rotor & Wing, 4 September 2008. Following the cancellation of the Super Seasprite, S-70 Seahawks from 816 Squadron were assigned to the Anzac- class frigates. =Egypt= In 1995, Egypt signed a contract for 10 SH-2Gs for use by the Egyptian Navy. These helicopters had been equipped for anti- submarine duties and to be deployed on the Navy's ships as required; the procurement included AQS-18A dipping sonar, search radars, and an electronic support suite. They are often operated alongside Egypt's fleet of Westland Sea Kings.Cordesman 2006, p. 184. =New Zealand= A Royal New Zealand Navy SH-2G(I) in 2016 The Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) replaced its Westland Wasps with four interim SH-2F Seasprites (ex-US Navy), to operate with Anzac-class frigates until the fleet of five new SH-2G Super Seasprites were delivered. The Navy air element was transferred to No. 6 Squadron RNZAF at RNZAF Base Auckland in Whenuapai in October 2005. RNZN Seasprites have seen service in East Timor. New Zealand purchased five SH-2Gs at the same time as Australia. However, New Zealand opted for new-build airframes that were outfitted with different avionics. The SH-2G purchase was completed at NZ$12 million under the $338 million budgeted (excluding GST). The first RNZN SH-2G was delivered in mid-2001, and the last was delivered February 2003. The Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) operates the type from its two Anzac-class frigates, two s, and the multi-role vessel . They were initially operated by the Naval Support Flight of No. 3 Squadron RNZAF, but now from No. 6 Squadron RNZAF. In May 2012, Defence Minister Jonathan Coleman announced that Cabinet had given Defence officials approval to negotiate with Kaman Corporation for the 11 helicopters and flight simulator from the canceled Australian SH-2G Super Seasprite project. It is thought the 11 helicopters, worth NZ$1.4 billion in 2008, would cost New Zealand between NZ$130 million to NZ$230 million. A decision to purchase ten of the helicopters for $NZ242 million was announced on 19 April 2013.\\"New Zealand approves purchase of Kaman Super Seasprites\\" Vertical Magazine, 19 April 2013. Accessed: 11 December 2013. Eight of the aircraft will enter service with the RNZAF to replace the existing five Seasprites, and the remaining two will be used as a source of spare parts. The New Zealand Ministry of Defence accepted the first of the helicopters in the United States on 1 December 2014, and two more will be delivered to Auckland in early 2015. It is expected that deliveries will be completed by the end of 2015. All the aircraft are scheduled to be in service by 2016. The NZDF's five SH-2G(NZ) Seasprites were officially retired on 14 April 2016, and will conduct their last flight on 21 April after serving since August 2001. They will be replaced with eight re-manufactured SH-2G(I) models, allowing the Navy to embark up to three helicopters from ships at once instead of two. The \\"I\\" model also replaces the AGM-65 Maverick with the AGM-119 Penguin anti-ship missile.New Zealand Replaces Old Seasprite Helicopters - Defensenews.com, 14 April 2016 New Zealand's first five SH-2Gs were sold to the Peruvian Navy in October 2014. =Peru= Four of the ex-New Zealand SH-2Gs will be remanufactured and upgraded by Kaman before they are introduced to service with the Peruvian Navy. The \\"implementation phase\\" of Peru's Seasprite purchase is expected to conclude in 2018.

Crosswinds focuses on cultural diversity, alternative learning styles, and environmental science as the foundations of its education. It provides academic and artistic opportunities for students from urban and suburban neighborhoods to achieve continuing success in a year-round program. The Perpich Center for Arts Education manages Crosswinds. Crosswinds teaches students from ages 11 to 16 (grades 6 through 10). In the beginning of the 2000s there was large gains for students of color, and with the recent conveyance student achievement has declined significantly according to standardized state testing results. Houses The student body of Crosswinds used to be divided into six houses before Perpich Center for the Arts took over. Those houses were called Sun, Sol, Earth, Pangaea, Water, and Aquarius. Schedule: The Crosswinds calendar is divided into four quarters, and each quarter is separated by a break. The effect of this is that Crosswinds is a year-round school, with school in June and July. Instead of a traditional summer vacation, Crosswinds students have part of the months of November, February, May, and August off. Students have the option to take elective classes called \\"intersession\\" during these break periods. Mission Crosswinds aims to offer artistic and academic opportunities to children from urban and suburban neighborhoods. Crosswinds strives to create a culturally diverse environment where each student's individual learning style is recognized. The school also places emphasis onto the study of the environment. Arts and the Performing Arts Students at Crosswinds can take one of four visual or performing art tracks. The tracks consist of Visual Art, Band, Orchestra, or Theater. The visual and performing art classes meet every day. All art areas teach the human experience through their own lenses. Science Crosswinds teaches science with hands-on, inquiry-based experiments. Administration and faculty Administration is shared between Perpich Center for the Arts and Crosswinds, although there is a full-time administrator at Crosswinds. Environment Crosswinds is located next to a farm in Woodbury, MN. The building is surrounded by forest and wildlife. The school was designed specifically as an arts and environmental science integration magnet and its architecture has won awards. It sits on a beautiful 37-acre property just off I-94 and I-494 that includes wooded areas, a lake and wetlands. Students maintain a vegetable and herb garden that provides fresh produce for use in the school's kitchen. The site also includes a peace garden, butterfly garden and tree nursery, all maintained by students and staff. Statistics and Data Crosswinds has a student body of 179 students. The student population by race is divided into 46.9% Caucasian, 19.0% Black, 20.7% Hispanic, 12.3% Asian/Pacific Islander and 1.1% Native American.  History and Facilities  While its core curriculum and values have stayed the same, Crosswinds has gone through many structural changes in its history. In 2001, Crosswinds moved to its current location ‚Äî A $17 million site in Woodbury, Minnesota. At that time it was known as the Crosswinds Arts and Science Middle School. Before 2001, classes were held at Arlington High School in Saint Paul. During the first several weeks of the 2001-2002 school year, classes were held in the 3M headquarters in Maplewood, MN. From when the Crosswinds building opened and up until 2004 the houses of Sun, Water, and Earth each taught students from the sixth, seventh, and eighth grades in one integrated classroom. The Sol house was created the year after, to accommodate more students. As such, Sol house had only sixth and seventh graders during the 2002-2003 school year. At the beginning of the 2004-2005 school year, the school was reorganized and the Sun house was re-purposed to contain only sixth graders, while Sol, Earth, and a new house called Pangaea became for the seventh and eighth grades only. The 9th grade was also added in the 2004-2005 school year, and the Water house was re-purposed to accommodate the high school students. In the 2005-2006 school year, the tenth grade was added and given a portion of the water house that was christened the Aquarius house. Crosswinds has been under management of Perpich Center for Arts Education since Spring 2014. Crosswinds originally was created as part of the East Metro Integration District (EMID), made up of the St. Paul and the school districts listed above. The EMID board at several points in its governance of the school reduced funding for the school and considered closure in order to focus its integration services within its districts. In late 2012, when none of its member districts wanted to take over running the school as an integration magnet program, EMID approached Perpich to request a proposal. After managing the school under a one-year contract during the 2013-14 school year, Perpich was granted official conveyance during the 2014 state legislative session. The new building received the international annual design award of the Council of Educational Facilities Planners International for 2002, the James D. MacConnell Award for outstanding new educational facilities, as well as awards from other organizations such as the American Institute of ArchitectsProject info and awards  References  External links  http://www.publicschoolreview.com/school_ov/school_id/42991 *http://wikimapia.org/2390855/Crosswinds-Arts-and-Science-Middle-School- Woodbury-Minnesota Public high schools in Minnesota Schools in Washington County, Minnesota Magnet schools in Minnesota ","title":"Crosswinds East Metro Arts and Science School"},{"id":"21248656","title":"Alejandro Silva (athlete)"},{"id":"21248681","text":"Bronx Park Terminal was a terminal station on the demolished IRT Third Avenue Line in the Bedford Park neighborhood of the Bronx in New York City. The station was located adjacent to Bronx Park and the New York Botanical Garden at 198th Street between Webster Avenue and Southern Boulevard, in the approximate location of the modern Fordham Preparatory School. It was opened on May 21, 1902 and closed on November 14, 1951.New York's El Lines 1867-1955 Electric Railroaders Assn Dec 1956, Bulletin #25 The next southbound stop was Fordham Road ‚Äì 190th Street. History The station was built as a one stop extension from Fordham Road ‚Äì 190th Street (then called Pelham Avenue) to provide direct service to Bronx Park, particularly the New York Botanical Garden. It was located on a 2,200 x 50 foot tract of land on the western edge of the campus of St. John's College (now the Rose Hill campus of Fordham University), purchased from the college by the Manhattan Railway Company. This characteristic was shared with much of Bronx Park, particularly the Bronx Zoo and Botanical Garden which were also built on former Fordham property. The station was the northern terminal for all Third Avenue Line trains until an extension north of Fordham Road on a separate right-of-way along Webster Avenue to Gun Hill Road was completed on October 4, 1920, which included a station at nearby 200th Street (now Bedford Park Boulevard). Due to reduced patronage at the station, beginning in 1948 no service ran to or from Bronx Park between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. The station was closed entirely in 1951, and the entire structure was demolished by 1952. Afterwards, the right-of-way of the stub line was re-purchased by Fordham University for $55,000. Station layout The station had three tracks, the easternmost two of which were served by one island platform. The westernmost track had no platform and was used for storage. Following the extension of the line on Webster Avenue, Bronx Park became a stub-end station separate from the mainline.

Written by members of the Boston Committee of Correspondence, the pamphlet outlined the rights of British American colonists and indicated how recent British policies were in violation of those rights. Although called the \\"Boston Pamphlet\\" by contemporaries, it was officially known as The Votes and Proceedings of the Freeholders and other Inhabitants of The Town of Boston, In Town Meeting assembled, According to Law.Brown, Revolutionary Politics, 68. The Boston Pamphlet had three sections of original material: \\"A State of the Rights of the Colonists\\", a \\"List of Infringements and Violation[s] of Rights\\", and a \\"Letter of Correspondence\\" addressed to the other towns of the Province of Massachusetts Bay. Traditionally, authorship of the three sections was attributed to Samuel Adams, Joseph Warren, and Benjamin Church, respectively, but historian Richard Brown argued that solitary authorship of any section was unlikely, and that each part was probably the group effort of a committee.Brown, Revolutionary Politics, 70n27. A fourth section contained correspondence between Governor Thomas Hutchinson and the town of Boston.Jensen, Tracts, 234. At issue was the decision of the British government to henceforth pay the salaries of the governor, lieutenant governor, and judges of Massachusetts, which were previously paid by the Massachusetts House of Representatives. Colonists were alarmed because this was a step away from responsible government, effectively making their leading officials independent of the electorate. In 1773, the Boston Committee of Correspondence printed 600 copies of the pamphlet and distributed them throughout the colony.Middlekauff, Glorious Cause, 223. Dozens of Massachusetts towns responded by passing similar resolves and forming their own committees of correspondence, which helped promote colonial unity in the evolving crisis that led to American independence.

In service of Mƒ∞T  Mehmet Eym√ºr, a leading official of the Turkish National Intelligence Organization (Mƒ∞T) disclosed that he was the first person to employ Alaattin √áakƒ±cƒ± for covert operations of the Mƒ∞T. Yavuz Ata√ß, an operations official, confirmed that he was introduced to Alaattin √áakƒ±cƒ± two months later he joined the Mƒ∞T in May 1987 as the manager of the security department. Ata√ß says \\"√áakƒ±cƒ± has been a fugitive, sought for six or seven crimes at the time he first met him\\". According to Ata√ß, √áakƒ±cƒ± was assigned to operations outside of Turkey. As determined by the security forces, √áakƒ±cƒ± was in 1995 on the assassination list of Dev Sol, a Marxist‚ÄìLeninist organization.  Second marriage  In 1991, √áakƒ±cƒ± made his second marriage with Nuriye Uƒüur Kƒ±lƒ±√ß, the daughter of D√ºndar Kƒ±lƒ±√ß, a mob boss of the Turkish underworld nicknamed the \\"godfather of godfathers\\" (). However, he and his father-in-law fell out following the chain of incidents known as the \\"Engin Civan Scandal\\". In November 1994, the couple divorced. He contracted the killing of his ex-wife Uƒüur Kƒ±lƒ±√ß and his ex-henchman Nurullah Tevfik Aƒüansoy. On 20 January 1995, she was shot dead with seven bullets fired by the hitman Abdurrahman Keskin in front of her son Onur in Uludaƒü, a ski resort in Bursa. It was on √áakƒ±cƒ±'s birthday.  Political ties and scandals  √áakƒ±cƒ± contracted the assassination of Cavit √áaƒülar, a wealthy businessman from Bursa and a high-level politician and government minister, and Mehmet √úst√ºnkaya, former president of Be≈üikta≈ü JK, in relation with the incidents known as the \\"T√ºrkbank scandal\\", in connection with the privatization of T√ºrk Ticaret Bankasƒ± to Korkmaz Yiƒüit. The plot was uncovered by the police at the preparation stage. He has close ties to Devlet Bah√ßeli, the president of the far-right political party MHP who visited him in prison and who in 2018 demanded a general amnesty for certain prisoners, naming √áakƒ±cƒ± personally. The demand was denied by the government, though.  Abroad (1992‚Äì1998)  √áakƒ±cƒ± fled abroad in 1992 with the help of a false passport. It was determined that he toured in Belgium, USA, Italy, South Africa, France, Brazil, Singapore and Japan. He is held responsible for the murder of 41 people.  Arrest in France (1998)  Informed by the Turkish police, French police apprehended him on 17 August 1998 in a hotel in Nice, France together with his bodyguard Murat G√ºler and his courier Aslƒ± Fato≈ü Ural, daughter of composer Sel√ßuk Ural. He had been carrying a fake diplomatic passport (red passport) on the name of \\"Nedim Caner\\" and US$17,000 cash with him. His capture revealed his connections not only to the intelligence service people but also to high-level politicians. Recording tapes published after his capture in 1998 in France led to the resignation of the government minister from the Motherland Party (ANAP) Ey√ºp A≈üƒ±k, who was accused of warning √áakƒ±cƒ± to flee. Meral Ak≈üener, minister of interior from the True Path Party (DYP), Mƒ∞T agent Yavuz Ata√ß and businessman Erol Evcil were also accused of the same allegation. After 16 months of isolated incarceration in France, he was returned to Turkey of his own will on 14 December 1999. He was imprisoned in Kartal Prison in Istanbul. Following controversies with rival gang member inmates, he was transferred to the maximum-security Kandƒ±ra prison in Kocaeli. In June 2000 he was sentenced to five years for running a criminal gang. Abroad (2003‚Äì2004) √áakƒ±cƒ± was released from the prison on 1 December 2002. Although not allowed to leave Turkey and his passport confiscated, he fled from Antalya to Greece by sea as told by a group of people, including his nephew and Erol Evcil, who were apprehended by the police in Fo√ßa, ƒ∞zmir. √áakƒ±cƒ± had obtained a passport with false identity and photograph from the police in √úmraniye, Istanbul.  Arrest in Austria (2004)  √áakƒ±cƒ± stayed four-and-a-half months in Paris and Strasbourg in France as observed by the Turkish police. In order to visit Ali √áakƒ±cƒ±, his son from the first marriage, in a hospital in Graz, he drove to Austria changing three times his car underway. His intention was to pass later to Italy to join his sweetheart Aslƒ± Fato≈ü Ural. Austrian police, informed by the Turkish police, apprehended √áakƒ±cƒ± on 14 July 2004 out of Graz. He had been carrying a Turkish special passport (green passport) issued on the name Faik Meral, a retired Mƒ∞T agent, and its expiration extended from the police in ƒ∞zmir. He had EUR 4,000 in cash with him. Visas in his passport showed that he traveled first to Russia and then entered Germany, where he stayed a while before going to France. On 14 October 2004, √áakƒ±cƒ± was deported from Austria at the request of the Turkish Ministry of Justice. He was brought from Vienna to Istanbul in a commercial airliner escorted by five policemen. After trial, he was imprisoned in the maximum-security prison in Tekirdaƒü.  Trials (2004‚Äìpresent)  After his return to Turkey, √áakƒ±cƒ± was put on trial, and found guilty of the following crimes: * Three years and four months' imprisonment for his contract to shoot the renowned journalist Hƒ±ncal Ulu√ß, as he had written a newspaper column about him and his wife Uƒüur Kƒ±lƒ±√ß he was about to divorce. * Three years and four months' imprisonment for organized crime in relation with the gunned assault on 26 March 2000 to the club local of Karag√ºmr√ºkspor in Istanbul. * Nineteen years and two months' imprisonment for his contract to murder his ex- wife. * Ten years and ten months' imprisonment for the gunned assault at the speculator Adil √ñngen's car.

It is often referred to as Sch√∂nau Abbey of Nassau (because it was founded by the House of Nassau and was located in their lands) or Sch√∂nau Abbey in Taunus, in order to differentiate it from the other Sch√∂nau Abbey in Baden-W√ºrttemberg. This Sch√∂nau Abbey is most well known as the convent of St. Elizabeth of Sch√∂nau. History Sch√∂nau Abbey was founded in 1126 as a Benedictine abbey by Rupert I, Count of Laurenburg, the Vogt of Lipporn. The property on which the monastery was built had already been donated in 1117 by Dudo of Laurenburg, Rupert‚Äôs father and predecessor, to Schaffhausen Abbey for establishment of the monastery. Its Romanesque buildings were constructed between 1126 and 1145, presumably with a three-nave basilica. At the same time, a nuns' convent was founded next to the monks' monastery. St. Elizabeth of Sch√∂nau worked there from 1141 until her death in 1164. Her brother Eckbert of Sch√∂nau (died 1184) entered the men‚Äôs monastery at Sch√∂nau in 1155 or 1156. Sch√∂nau Abbey had grown strong enough economically by 1340 that the city of Frankfurt am Main could promise support through arms and wagons. A Gothic chancel (still extant today) and a chapel dedicated to St. Elizabeth were added between 1420 and 1430 on the north side of the nave. During the Protestant Reformation, the surrounding communities of Str√ºth, Welterod, and Lipporn became Protestant between 1541 and 1544, but Sch√∂nau Abbey remained Catholic. In 1606, the convent was dissolved because only a few sisters still lived in Sch√∂nau under fairly loose religious rule. During the Thirty Years War, Swedish and Hessian soldiers attacked Sch√∂nau Abbey between 1631 and 1635. The Swedes drove off the monks, plundered the monastery, broke into the grave of St. Elizabeth and scattered her bones. Only the skull was rescued. It is now preserved in a reliquary on the right-side altar of the church. A major fire in 1723 destroyed the church and convent, and only the Gothic chancel remains extant today from the original buildings. The abbey received its present shape in reconstruction over the following years. The chapel to Elizabeth, however, was not rebuilt. Recent history In the course of secularization in 1802 and 1803, the monks' community was dissolved and the monastery became the property of the state of Nassau. Some of the buildings were sold to private individuals. The parish previously affiliated with Sch√∂nau Abbey became part of the Vicariate General of Limburg an der Lahn, which would then become the Diocese of Limburg in 1827. In 1904, the Dernbacher Sisters (officially, the Ancillae Domini Jesu Christi, the Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ) moved into the monastery. From 1947 to 1975, displaced Premonstratensians from Tepl√° Abbey in Czechoslovakia also lived there. The last Dernbacher sisters left the monastery in 1986. Since then the buildings have been used by the local Catholic parish of St. Florin. In 1994, the parish established the Sch√∂nauer Book Corner as a public library. Three years later, the former work buildings became \\"One World House, Sch√∂nau Abbey\\" a learning and meeting place for groups. Also in the rooms of the One World House, a computer training facility and an Internet caf√© were opened in 2001.

California Home Landscaping, Creative Homeowner Press The plant grows as a clump of long, straplike leaves, up to two metres long, from which arises a much taller flowering shoot, with dramatic yellow or red flowers. The fibre has been widely used since the arrival of MƒÅori to New Zealand, originally in MƒÅori traditional textiles and also in rope and sail makinghttp://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Gov09_02Rail-t1-body-d7-d2.html after the arrival of Europeans until at least WWII. It is an invasive species in some of the Pacific Islands and in Australia. The blades of the plant contain cucurbitacins, which are poisonous to some animals, and some of them are among the bitterest tastes to humans. Ecology The jumping spider Trite planiceps lives predominantly in the rolled-up leaves of this species. Phormium tenax is a coastal cover plant associated with significant habitat such as the breeding habitat for the endangered yellow-eyed penguin.C. Michael Hogan. 2009. Yellow-eyed Penguin: Megadypes antipodes, GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. N. Stromberg Cultivation Phormium tenax had many uses in traditional MƒÅori society. Many of these uses have largely fallen into disuse, though there is an upswing in the use of traditional materials in modern MƒÅori art and craft. The two most common forms for flax in traditional craft are the use of stripped, dried leaves as broad bands, such as in the weaving of kete (flax baskets), and the scraping, pounding, and washing of the leaves to create a fibre ‚Äî muka ‚Äî which is used in tƒÅniko (weaving) of soft, durable fabric for clothing. Flax is also used as a decorative and structural element in tukutuku, panelling found within M√£ori wharenui (meeting houses). A worker feeding a flax leaf into a stripper Prior to the Great Depression of the 1930s, which decimated flax as an industry, there were two serious attempts by Europeans to breed for fibre. The first was by Wellington-based Leonard Cockayne about 1908.http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi- bin/paperspast?a=d&cl;=search&d;=DOM19080507.2.60 The second by Massey-based John Stuart Yeates in the late 1920s.http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi- bin/paperspast?a=d&cl;=search&d;=EP19291221.2.108http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi- bin/paperspast?a=d&cl;=search&d;=EP19300920.2.20 New Zealand Flax was cultivated on Saint Helena from the late 1800s to around 1966 for the production of string and rope and for export.http://sainthelenaisland.info/flax.htm Today the plants remain but the industry has stopped; they are considered an ecological problem.http://sainthelenaisland.info/endemics.htm =Ornamental= In recent times, P. tenax and its cousin P. colensoi have been widely cultivated as ornamental garden plants, their striking fans of pointed leaves providing a focal point in mixed plantings or at the edge of a lawn. They are easy to grow in a sunny spot, especially in coastal areas with some protection in winter, but require reliably moist soil. They are frequently found in garden centres amongst plants with a similar appearance, notably Yucca and Cordyline. However, these are very different plants with different requirements. P. tenax and some cultivars can grow to a substantial size - tall by broad. =Cultivars= More recently several cultivars have been selected as decorative garden plants, including:Frances Tenenbaum. 2003. \\"Taylor's Encyclopedia of Garden Plants\\", Houghton Mifflin Company *'Bronze Baby' - arching bronze leaves, plant. *'Dazzler' - arching leaves that are bronze- maroon with red and pink stripes, plant reaches 3 feet in height *'Duet' *'Sundowner'  plant, leaves are striped with bronze, green and rose-pink *'Variegatum' *'Yellow Wave' Those marked have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

History thumb The Sinhalese medical tradition records back to pre historic era. Besides a number of medical discoveries that are only now being acknowledged by western medicine, the ancient Sinhalese are believed to be responsible for introducing the concept of hospitals to the world. According to the Mahawansa, the ancient chronicle of Sinhalese royalty. King Pandukabhaya had lying-in-homes and hospitals (Sivikasotthi-Sala) built in various parts of the country after having fortified his capital at Anuradhapura in the 4th century BCE. Ruins of a hospital in Mihintale which was built by King Sena II (851-885 A.C.) that dates back to the 9th century has been discovered and it is considered as one of the world's oldest hospitals. Several Sinhalese kings ancient Sri Lanka are known to be practitioners of medicine, King Buddhadasa (340‚Äì368 AC) was said to be adept in general medicine, surgery, midwifery and veterinary medicine and he is known for the surgical operation on an outcaste (Chandala) woman in order to deliver her child and the surgical removal of a lump in the belly of a snake. \\"Sarartha Sangraha\\", a comprehensive medical treatise in Sanskrit, is also attributed to King Buddhadasa. King Aggabodhi VII (766‚Äì772 A.C.) is known for his medical research and according to the Culavamsa, the king \\"studied the medicinal plants over the entire island of Lanka to ascertain whether they were wholesome or harmful to the sick.\\" Excavations of the ruins of Ancient hospitals have uncovered several surgical instruments like Forceps, Scalpels and Scissors as well as spoons that are believed to be used to mix or administer medicine. The hospitals in ancient Sri Lanka had toilets and baths that were attached to the living quarters. The hospitals had been designed for ventilation and free circulation of air due to two open courts in addition to the windows which indicates that psychological aspects of therapeutics were understood by Medical practitioners.  Overview  Sri Lanka has a universal health care system that extends free healthcare to all citizens, which has been a national priority. OPD facilities are readily available in public (general) hospitals situated in major towns and cities, with laboratory and radiology facilities common in most. But most illnesses can be treated in teaching hospitals in Colombo, Colombo South, Colombo North, Kandy/Peradeniya, Galle (Karapitiya Hospital) and Jaffna. All doctors and nurses in the government hospitals are qualified and trained, with some of the most experienced staff working at the teaching hospitals. For emergencies, especially accidents, it is highly recommended to go directly to general hospital accident services as they are equipped with the staff and facilities to handle emergencies. Despite low levels of health expenditures, Sri Lanka's health indicators are comparable to more developed countries in the region. The public healthcare system also has long waiting lists for specialized care and advanced procedures. As a result, reliance on private care is increased.  Recognized councils  * Sri Lankan traditional medicine  (Western) medicine * Sri Lanka Ayuruvedic Council  Traditional Sinhala medicine  Ayouruveda  Siddha  Unani * Sri Lanka Homeopathy Council Homeopathy  Hospitals = Western Medical Hospitals = There are 555 government hospitals in Sri Lanka, in addition to several other government hospitals treating according to the Ayurvedic System. A large number of private hospitals have appeared in Sri Lanka, due to the rising income of people and demand for private healthcare services. They provide much more luxurious service than government hospitals, but they are mostly limited to Colombo and its suburbs and also have high prices. Some of the best known private hospitals are Nawaloka Hospital, Asiri Hospital, Hemas Hospital, Lanka Hospitals and the Durdans Hospitals. In Colombo, many of the private hospitals are located in Narahenpita area; namely, Asiri, Asiri Surgical, Oasis, Ninewells, etc. In addition to Colombo, many leading cities such as Gampaha, Kandy, Galle also have private hospitals. As of 2014 the public sector accounted for 73% of the hospitals and 93% of the available bed capacity in Sri Lanka, while handling over 90% of the total patient admissions and outpatient visits to hospitals. In the private sector, the top five players the Dr Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH), Asiri, Nawaloka Hospitals PLC (Nawaloka), Durdans Hospitals (Durdans) and The Lanka Hospitals ‚Äì accounted for nearly 45% of the private-sector bed capacity, with NFTH the market leader with 1,002 beds. = Other hospitals =Medical schools=(Western) medicine= * Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo (formerly the Ceylon Medical College)  Postgraduate Institute of Medicine, University of Colombo * Faculty of Healthcare and Sciences, Eastern University * Faculty of Medicine, University of Jaffna * Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya (formerly the North Colombo Medical College) * Faculty of Medicine, University of Peradeniya * Faculty of Medicine, Rajarata University * Faculty of Medicine, University of Ruhuna * Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Sri Jayawardenapura * Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University * Faculty of Medicine, General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University * Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, University of Peradeniya faculty of allied health sciences,university of sri jayewardenepura =Other= Sinhala traditional medicine No formal system exist for traditional Sinhal medical education.

The town of Mullaitivu was the last stronghold of the LTTE. The government declared on 25 January 2009 that its troops had entered the town and were consolidating their positions. Detailed map of Mullaitivu District The Sri Lanka Air Force had been attacking LTTE positions in and around Mullaitivu for several days before the government troops claimed to have entered it. After the Battle of Kilinochchi (23 November 2008 ‚Äì 2 January 2009), during which the Sri Lankan military captured the LTTE stronghold of Kilinochchi, the Ministry of Defence had stated that the military's next target was Mullaitivu. Leaflets had been dropped by the Sri Lanka Air Force earlier over the town, urging civilians to come to government controlled \\"safe zones\\". The government also suspended all civil administration work on 23 January to allow public servants to leave the area. The army had allowed a \\"safe area\\" inside the war zone for civilians to exit. Independent aid agencies report about 230,000 civilians were inside the war zone around the northern city. Background The LTTE captured the Mullaitivu military base and town in 1996, following a battle which resulted in at least 1639 soldiers being killed or missing. The LTTE used the town as their main military base since then. A large base of the Sea Tigers was also located in Mullaitivu. Mullaitivu had been a main target of the Sri Lankan military offensive in the Northern Theatre of Eelam War IV. Battle Before the battle, public offices in Mullaittivu were closed for the weekend and government employees had moved out of the city ahead of the impending military action on 25 January. Civilians from Mullaittivu were also seen moving towards the north into the jungle areas where the LTTE guerrillas had retreated. On 24 January 2009, the LTTE had blown up a dam near the town which flooded the surrounding areas. LTTE fighters also built earth barriers, which made it difficult for the army to approach with heavy tanks. Infantrymen of the Sri Lankan army's 7th Gemunu Watch first entered the town after facing fierce resistance from the LTTE. The ground forces were backed by helicopter gunships of the Sri Lankan Air Force. Sri Lankan troops also moved in with a small group of boats from the western side of Mullaittivu. Later, the 59th Division was involved in the consolidating the captured town. Some LTTE fighters were later reported to be hiding in a small area between Vishwamadhu and Puthukkudiyiruppu. Aftermath With the fall of Mullaitivu, the LTTE lost approximately 95 percent of the land they had once controlled. Sarath Fonseka, the commander of the Sri Lanka Army, then requested the public to celebrate the victory with dignity by hoisting the national flag. Before the town was captured, the Sri Lankan army seized two nearby facilities used for making bombs and landmines that reportedly contained 4,000 detonators and 150 kg of explosives. The Sri Lankan army continued to target LTTE positions after the capture of Mullaitivu, and attacked remaining LTTE positions inside jungles. LTTE chief Velupillai Prabhakaran was said to be hiding in the last jungle areas held. However, the Sri Lankan government was never certain of the exact location. His body was found floating in a mangrove swamp after all resistance had ended. India and Malaysia had also taken steps to prevent Prabhakaran from entering their territories. Prabhakaran was wanted in India for the assassination of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. International reactions * Pranab Mukherjee, Minister of External Affairs, visited Colombo to put forth India's demand to extradite Prabhakaran if he is caught alive. India was to \\"seek the safety of Tamil population in Sri Lanka.\\" However, Mukherjee stated that India has no sympathies with the LTTE which is a banned organisation in India. * Jonas Gahr St√∏re, Foreign Affairs Minister of the Government of Norway said Norway condemned the \\"conduct of current hostilities causing unacceptable suffering of civilians\\" in the offensive, with International Development Minister Erik Solheim urging the parties to ensure that food and other humanitarian assistance reach the population ‚Äì \\"The sick and wounded must be given access to treatment, and ambulances need to freely enter and leave the conflict area.\\" A health official reported that at least 300 civilians were wounded and scores killed by Sri Lankan army artillery shells fired into a designated \\"safe zone\\" for Tamils trapped by fighting between the military and Tamil rebels.

It was serialized by Shogakukan in Sh≈çnen Sunday from September 23, 1970 (issue 43) to July 28, 1982 (issue 30). Dame Oyaji received the 1979 Shogakukan Manga Award for sh≈çnen manga. The manga was compiled in 39 volumes, with Akebono Shuppan publishing the first 21 volumes under their Akebono Comics label and Shogakukan publishing the final 18 volumes under their Sh≈çnen Sunday Comics label. All 39 volumes are available in eBook format via eBook Japan, the Shogakukan volumes (starting with volume 4) subtitled as the \\"My Way\\" arc. Dame Oyaji is the story of Damesuke Amano, a hapless office worker who faces a tremendous amount of bullying on the job and especially at home, where he has (contrary to traditional Japanese notions of family) absolutely no power or say in the runnings of the household whatsoever. Amano lives with his wife, Onibaba, his beautiful teenaged daughter Yukiko, and his grade-schooler son Takobo. Onibaba is an imposing, violent heifer of a woman who regularly berates and even physically assaults her husband and who enjoys nothing more than making his life miserable; Yukiko and Takobo frequently join in physically and psychologically abusing their father. The original manga is said to have been quite shocking to early 1970s Japan, in which the father was often still traditionally regarded as the head of the household. The series was adapted as a 26-episode anime television series broadcast on Tokyo Channel 12 (now TV Tokyo) between April 2 and October 9, 1974. Each half-hour episode comprised two shorter stories of approximately ten minutes in length. The anime toned down the original manga's level of violence considerably for a prime-time TV audience (although it is still quite violent) and featured episodes which focused more on Takobo and his everyday school and home life. The Takobo-focused episodes in particular are kinder and gentler than the series as a whole (for example, an episode in which Takobo fears losing his sister Yukiko, whom he idolizes, to marriage and, after trying various tactics to ruin her relationship with a potential suitor, runs away from home).

Health infrastructure  Medical facilities are severely limited, medical materials are in short supply. An adequate supply of prescription or over-the-counter drugs in local stores or pharmacies is also generally not available. Payment for any medical services is expected in cash in the DR Congo, in advance of treatment.  Health status = Life expectancy = In 2018, the CIA estimated the average life expectancy in the DR Congo to be 60.3 years: 59 for the male population and 61.6 for females (est. 2017.) =Malaria= Malaria is a major health problem in the DR Congo. Malaria is the principal cause of morbidity and mortality, accounting for more than 40 percent of all outpatient visits and for 19 percent of deaths among children under five years of age. Given that the majority of the population lives in high transmission zones, it has been estimated that the DRC accounts for 11 percent of all cases of malaria in sub- Saharan Africa. The National Malaria Control Strategic Plan 2016‚Äì2020 (NSP) introduced the stratification of provinces based on parasite prevalence as measured by the 2013 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). This approach allows the NSP to focus high-impact interventions in the areas that bear the greatest disease burden. In line with this strategy, international donors are concentrating their efforts in 9 out of 26 provinces (Kasai Oriental, Haut Katanga, Haut Lomami, Tanganyika, Lualaba, Sankuru, Lomami, Kasai Central, and Sud Kivu). According to the 2013 DHS, progress is being made in key malaria interventions, such as insecticide-treated net ownership and use. Additionally, mortality rates for children under five years of age fell by 34 percent and the incidence rate fell by 40 percent between 2010 and 2018. = Other endemic diseases = Yellow fever and any other insect-borne illnesses are present as well. = HIV/AIDS = HIV/Aids is the most serious health problem in the DR Congo due to the incurable nature of the disease. By the end of 2003, UNAIDS estimated that 1.1 million people were living with HIV/AIDS, for an overall adult HIV prevalence of 4.2%. Life expectancy in the DR Congo dropped 9% in the 1990s as a result of HIV/AIDS.According to UNAIDS, several factors fuel the spread of HIV in the DR Congo, including the movement of large numbers of refugees and soldiers, scarcity and high cost of safe blood transfusions in rural areas, a lack of counseling, few HIV testing sites, high levels of untreated sexually transmitted infections among sex workers and their clients, and low availability of condoms outside Kinshasa and one or two provincial capitals. With an eventual end of hostilities and a government in transition, population movements associated with increased stability and economic revitalization will exacerbate the spread of HIV, which is now localized in areas most directly affected by the presence of troops and war- displaced populations. Consecutive wars have made it nearly impossible to conduct effective and sustainable HIV/AIDS prevention activities. = Cholera = Although incidence and mortality from cholera can be difficult to estimate, particularly given the DRC's lack of resources and inadequate surveillance systems, several studies demonstrate that the DRC experiences a significant burden of disease. In 2015, 19,705 cases of cholera were reported in the DRC. Few cases are laboratory-confirmed, so the incidence of cholera can be under-estimated. The highest annual attack rates occurred in 2011 in the Eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo that border the Great Lakes. These provinces are Orientale, North and South Kivu, Katanga and Kasai Oriental. North and South Kivu as well as Katanga had the highest attack rate with over 10 cases per 100,000 people, every year between 2000 and 2011. The high annual attack rates occurred in the Eastern provinces because there is an environmental reservoir for V. cholerae in the lakes of the rift valley. Additionally, there are seasonal peaks that usually occur during the first quarter of the year which also increases the attack rate. Furthermore, fishermen travel from the eastern lakes in the Democratic Republic of Congo to larger cities at the end of the dry season which gives way to seasonal variations in incidence of Cholera. Cross-border cholera remains difficult to track due to the lack of collaboration and communication between the Sub- Saharan countries. = Disease outbreaks = Bar graph of Democratic Republic of the Congo EVD outbreaks 1976-present Mycobacterium tuberculosis There have been 10 outbreaks of the Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Additionally, hemorrhagic fever, polio, cholera, and typhoid, while tuberculosis is an increasingly serious health concern in the DR Congo. In 2019 a measles outbreak claimed more deaths than Ebola. = River blindness = People are at risk of onchocerciasis (River blindness) in parts of the DR Congo. = Maternal and child healthcare = The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Democratic Republic of the Congo is 670. This is compared with 533.6 in 2008 and 550 in 1990. The under 5 mortality rate, per 1,000 births is 199 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5's mortality is 26. In Democratic Republic of the Congo the number of midwives per 1,000 live births is 2 and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women 1 in 24.

Before that he was Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and a lobbyist for Raytheon. Life and career Lynn graduated from Dartmouth College in 1976, and later studied at Cornell Law School to receive his law degree in 1980 and graduated from the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University in 1982 with an M.A. in public affairs. After this he was employed by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, where he was the executive director of the Defense Organization Project from 1982 to 1985. That last year he and Barry Blechman published the book Toward a More Effective Defense. At some point in time he was a senior fellow studying strategic nuclear forces and arms control at the National Defense University's Strategic Concepts Development Center, and went on to be the legislative counsel for defense and arms control matters for Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy between 1987 and 1993. During this time he also worked as Kennedy's staff representative on the Committee on Armed Services. Lynn as Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) Lynn later worked as an assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Budget, and in April 1993 joined the office of the Secretary of Defense (then Les Aspin) to be director for program analysis and evaluation. On October 21, 1997, President Bill Clinton nominated Lynn to be Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), and after a Senate confirmation on November 13, he was sworn in on November 19. After leaving at the end of the Clinton Presidency, Lynn became the executive vice president of the management consulting firm DFI International in 2001, but left in August 2002 when he was hired by the Raytheon Company, where he held the title senior vice president of Government Operations and Strategy. Lynn is also a member of the Atlantic Council' s Board of Directors. =Deputy Secretary of Defense= Lynn being sworn in as Deputy Secretary of Defense, accompanied by his wife. On January 8, 2009, President-elect Barack Obama nominated Lynn as his Deputy Secretary of Defense. This was complicated by the fact that new ethic rules promulgated by Obama for members of his administration created a waiting period of two years between lobbying activities and working for the administration on the same issues, which Lynn's work with Raytheon violated. President Obama waived the new rules for Lynn, which received criticism from John McCain as well as outside groups such as the Project on Government Oversight, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, Government Accountability Project, and Public Citizen. McCain later said that the nomination should probably move forward. As nominee, Lynn agreed to sell his holdings of Raytheon stock. Lynn's appointment was approved by the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee on February 5, 2009 by unanimous consent. On February 11, 2009, Lynn was confirmed in the full Senate by a vote of 93‚Äì4. He took the oath of office on February 12. Lynn cautioned in May 2009 that Congress and the Obama administration should be careful not to make things worse in overhauling the Pentagon's weapons-buying practices. \\"We need to keep in mind the importance of not making the system worse in our efforts to achieve reform,\\" Lynn said in testimony prepared for the House Armed Services Committee. \\"This has happened in the past.\\" Lynn told lawmakers the Pentagon will hire 20,000 new personnel to manage weapons acquisition as part of sweeping reforms that President Obama and Congress have been pushing for. The proposal to hire 20,000 new employees is \\"aggressive,\\" Lynn said, but the Pentagon needs program managers, cost estimators, software engineers and systems engineers. He said Pentagon leadership will start bringing the new people in at the beginning of fiscal 2010. \\"We are mindful it is going to be an organizational challenge,\\" he said.Lynn: Government must take care with Pentagon reform Lynn touring Marine positions in Afghanistan. The Pentagon leadership has started a sweeping effort to free up about $100 billion over the next five years to maintain current fighting forces and to modernize weapons systems. Lynn in June 2010 said the goal is to find more savings within the defense budget without cutting the top-line number. Pentagon leaders are eying 2 to 3 percent real growth in the Pentagon's budget for the areas that need it most: force structure and modernization. Two-thirds of the $100 billion cost savings spread out over the next five years will come from trimming overhead on a department-wide basis. That money will be directly transferred into the force structure and modernization accounts, Lynn explained. The rest of the cost savings would come from \\"developing efficiencies within those force structure and modernization accounts,\\" he added. \\"If we're able to reduce overhead accounts where we don't need those increases, shift it to the force structure and modernization accounts, we can get that 2 to 3 percent [real growth] and we can do what we think we need to do in technology refresh, modernization, protecting quality of life and all those critical factors.\\"Pentagon aims to find $100B in savings Lynn warned that in order to get to the $100 billion in savings the Pentagon leadership and the military services will have to identify \\"lower priority programs\\" that are not going to be part of future budgets.Roxana Tiron: Pentagon aims to find $100B in savings - 06/04/10 On January 6, 2011, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates outlined the $100 bn worth of savings planned over the next 5 fiscal years (FY2012-FY2016) designed to be reinvested in military capabilities, plus additional 5-year savings worth $78 bn designed to contribute to deficit reduction. These include, among other things, the consolidation of numbered air force staff, the disestablishment of JFCOM and the Second Fleet, Air Mobility Command fuel savings, multi-year procurement policies, and cancellations of hundreds of report requirements (many of them dating back to the 1950s). In May 2011 Lynn indicated that the department is moving to balance how much it invests in counterinsurgency versus more traditional military capabilities. \\"I think you can decide which of those two you want to emphasize,\\" said William Lynn. \\"I don't think you can eliminate either. I don't think that's possible.\\" Lynn said the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have been more difficult than had been expected, but the U.S. military must have enough troops and the right kind of training, equipment and family support for future long conflicts, which he said are still \\"plausible.\\"AL Pessin: US Becoming More Leery of Long Wars - June 08, 2011 In July Lynn announced that he would leave DoD. \\"Bill Lynn has provided outstanding advice and counsel to this department and to the nation over the course of his long career,\\" Leon Panetta said in a statement released on 7 July. \\"I will rely on his experience and expertise during this transition period.

In 2015, in congruence with a new democratic government, a series of healthcare reforms were enacted. In 2017, the reformed government spent 5.2% of GDP on healthcare expenditures. Health indicators have begun to improve as spending continues to increase. Patients continue to pay the majority of healthcare costs out of pocket. Although, out of pocket costs were reduced from 85% to 62% from 2014 to 2015. They continue to drop annually. The global average of healthcare costs paid out of pocket is 32%. Both public and private hospitals are understaffed due to a national shortage of doctors and nurses. Public hospitals lack many of the basic facilities and equipment. WHO consistently ranks Myanmar among the worst nations in healthcare. Health infrastructure Burma has 6 medical universities: 5 civilian and one military.

In 2005, the estimated adult HIV prevalence rate in Burma was 1.3% (200,000 - 570,000 people), according to UNAIDS, and early indicators show that the epidemic may be waning in the country, although the epidemic continues to expand. The National AIDS Programme Burma found that 32% of sex workers and 43% of intravenous drug users in Burma have HIV. The national government spent US$137,120 (K150,831,600) in 2005 on HIV, while international donors (the governments of Norway, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, and Sweden) donated US$27,711,813 towards HIV programmes in Burma. Burma (ranked 51 out of 166 countries) has one of Asia's highest adult HIV prevalence rates, following Cambodia and Thailand. An estimated 20,000 (range of 11,000 to 35,000) die from HIV/AIDS annually.  Malaria  Myanmar made significant progress in malaria control in the 2010s, with an 80 percent reduction in the number of confirmed malaria cases registered from 2011 to 2016 (from 567,452 to 110,146 respectively) and a 96 percent reduction in the number of deaths attributable to malaria has been reported in the same period (from 581 to 21 respectively). Yet the malaria burden in Myanmar remains the highest among the six countries of the Greater Mekong Subregion, and an early warning sign of artemisinin resistance ‚Äì delayed parasite clearance ‚Äì has been reported in several parts of the country. Despite this, the annual monitoring of the therapeutic efficacy of first- and second-line recommended artemisinin- based combination therapies (artemether-lumefantrine and dihydroartemisinin- piperaquine) has shown that both are still fully efficacious with an adequate clinical and parasitological response above 95 percent. P. falciparum, accounting for 60 percent of all malaria cases, and P. vivax are the major parasite species, and there are 10 malaria-transmitting mosquito species. Analysis of the age and the sex distribution of malaria cases shows that the majority of cases occur in adult males, reflecting the risk associated with occupations such as mining, rubber tapping, construction, and forest-related activities. The ultimate goal of Myanmar‚Äôs National Strategic Plan for Intensifying Malaria Control and Accelerating Progress Towards Malaria Elimination (2016‚Äì2020) is to eliminate P. falciparum malaria by 2025 and all forms of malaria by 2030.

In August 2016, 30% of children in Ukraine were fully immunized against measles, 10%, against hepatitis B, and 3% of against diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus.Read more on UNIAN: http://www.unian.info/society/1556482-us-canada-ambassadors- urge-putting-routine-immunization-in-ukraine-back-on-track.html At the time Ukraine had the lowest routine immunization rate in the world. As of June 2019, Ukraine is suffering one of the world's worst measles epidemics with more than 100,000 cases since 2017, with 16 deaths in 2018. In 2016 only 31% of the population had been immunised with the MMR vaccine. Various reasons are given for the low rate of vaccination including: a distrust of the state in the 1990s, a failure to keep vaccine supplies reliably refrigerated leading to ineffectiveness, a poorly informed medical profession and a high level of vaccine distrust in the wider population. Children are required to be vaccinated before entering the school system, but Unicef estimates that as many as 30% of vaccination certificates are falsified. =High blood pressure and obesity= According to a study, entitled \\"Main reasons for the high death rate in Ukraine\\" conducted by the World Bank and released in December 2010 every third Ukrainian aged 18‚Äì65, including every fifth aged 18‚Äì25, had a high blood pressure. Almost 29% of the respondents suffered from being overweight, and 20% suffered from obesity. =Smoking= According to the above-mentioned 2010 World Bank study 36% (28.6% is the average in Europe) of Ukrainians smoke tobacco, including 31% of those who smoke every day. Men with primary education and women with higher education are inclined to smoking. Some 80% of daily smokers are men. The average age that daily smokers start the habit is decreasing, and at present is 16 years. In the younger age group there are four times as many smokers as in the older age group.

Vnee Yeh is also the past chairman of Hsin Chong Construction, a company founded by his grandfather, until he sold the controlling interest to The Mission Hills Group in 2007. Yeh is also a trustee of Milton Academy, Massachusetts. Biography Yeh is the elder of two children of Geoffrey Yeh, former managing director of Hsin Chong Construction, which was founded by his father. He attended Diocesan Boys' School, and graduated from Williams College and Columbia Law School. Yeh is known for an unusual academic background. He concentrated on Marxist history at Williams, had hair longer than his current crew cut would allow one to imagine, and was known as a leftist liberal. He then surprised his family and peers by entering law school at Columbia where he won numerous academic awards. After qualifying for the California Bar, Yeh yet again changed directions and accepted an offer to join Lazard Freres in New York and rose rapidly within the firm. He resigned as a partner in Lazard Brothers Capital Markets in London in 1990 in response to a call from his family to help restructure their various interests. In a series of path- breaking transactions in Hong Kong he split the family's holding company into two pieces, Hsin Chong Construction Group and Hsin Chong International Holdings. He then led an MBO of HCIH in 1992 which became known within the financial industry as an extremely astute transaction in light of the fact the bid was timed almost to the day to match the trough of the Asian shipping market. HCIH later repaid virtually all of the cost of the MBO just through the sale of HCIH's shipping fleet, leaving behind the bulk of the assets of the company with a zero cost base. In 1993, when Warren Buffett style value investing was virtually unknown in the region, and not available to the average investor, he co-founded Value Partners Limited with Cheah Cheng Hye to focus on the niche in Asia, and in particular Greater China. Since its IPO in the late 2000s the firm has grown many-fold. Value Partners is now one of the leading investment groups in the region and is listed on the Kong Kong Stock Exchange. In 2002, Yeh co-founded Argyle Street Management, an Asian distressed and special opportunities fund (ranked 22nd in Asia) and in 2003 joined Cheetah Investment Management as chairman, re-structuring Cheetah to identify and capitalize on select Asian investment themes. Cheetah has since launched the Arcus Japan Value Fund, the Cheetah Korea Value Fund, the Pan Asia Fund, the Steel Partners China Access Fund and the Saizen REIT. Saizen REIT, a real estate investment trust holding a portfolio of Japanese Residential assets, is listed on the Singapore Exchange.http://www.sgxnews.net/saizen-reit-more-insider-moves/ On 21 January 2009, it was announced that Yeh was appointed to the Executive Council of Hong Kong with immediate effect. Yeh stayed on until his term expired on 30 June 2012. Yeh, who was a non-executive director of Next Media Group, resigned the post on his appointment. For many, Yeh's appointment came as a total surprise. Yeh has never harboured any political ambition, nor demonstrated any political interest. In fact, he can be described as politically naive and socially shy. It is rumored that he turned down the appointment several times until pressed that it was a social duty in light of all he had been given. A social liberal at heart he is known to have a Jeffersonian political bent tempered by a strong stripe of \\"Volcker-like\\" economic conservatism. Yeh's views are shaped by his leftist experience in college and his professional exposure in finance. The common denominator is his belief in equity and opportunity for all, regardless of birth, class, race or background. Yeh supports democracy but with deep academic roots in constitutional law, understands the need to counterbalance the risks of \\"the tyranny of the majority\\". He acknowledges China's shortcomings ( and has not hesitated to criticize China's mistakes in the past) but over time has become a stronger and stronger supporter of China's gradualist approach in light of her size and complexity. Deeply affected by stories of the deprivation he heard from his family in China before the revolution, he is an outspoken admirer of China's progress in the last 3 decades and has paraphrased Churchill in stating that \\"never has so many owed so much to so few\\" (he is also not a blind apologist and has not been unwilling to voice concerns when mistakes have been made, to wit, he was not afraid to become a director of Next Media, when most Hong Kong business figures would have run as far as they could from the offer ). Yeh is a difficult animal to intellectually pigeon-hole and has often steered his own path. From his position in Exco, he has stated that his primary goal is to forge a political and social consensus to bring Hong Kong forward, and to further enhance its attractiveness as a financial centre, an urbane city, and a multi-cultural center with a unique quality of life. Personal life V-Nee and Mira Yeh have one daughter, Nadya. Yeh is known as an avid water sportsman and extreme alpine skier. His singular claim to fame is skiing over 30 days a year whilst residing in HK where it never snows.The 500 list W-Y, Hong Kong Tatler, Access date 16 February 2009 Yeh has a rather eccentric personal regime, foregoing breakfast and lunch; dining early; retiring to bed before 8:30pm and rising at 04:00 on week nights to train. He keeps a low social profile but is known as an oenophile with a passion for discovering unknown and unusual boutique wines.

The King Hussein Cancer Center (KHCC) (Arabic ŸÖÿ±ŸÉÿ≤ ÿßŸÑÿ≠ÿ≥ŸäŸÜ ŸÑŸÑÿ≥ÿ±ÿ∑ÿßŸÜ),,. is a medical center in Amman, Jordan. It treats both adult and pediatric patients. KHCC treats over 3500 new cancer patients every year from Jordan and the region. The Center was initially named Al-Amal center (hope center) founded in 1997 by the late King Hussein. In 2002, the center was renamed to the King Hussein Cancer Center in honor of the late King who died from cancer complications. The King Hussein Cancer Foundation (KHCF) undertakes various fundraising activities to support and maintain the mission of KHCC as a comprehensive cancer center of excellence. KHCF is a free-standing, independent, non-governmental, nonprofit organization established by a royal decree to combat cancer in Jordan and the Middle East region. The foundation and center is run by a board of trustees consisting of a dedicated group of prominent volunteers and chaired by Princess Ghida Talal. The director general of KHCF is Princess Dina Mired of Jordan and Dr. Asem Mansour is the director general of KHCC. Princess Ghida serves as the Chair of the Board of Trustees of the King Hussein Cancer Foundation. History Prior to the mid-1980s, there was no infrastructure for treating cancer patients in Jordan. For quality care, wealthy patients sought treatment abroad, while those without means were treated locally, with limited resources and poor results. In 1997, the Al-Amal Center, meaning \\"The Center of Hope\\", opened its doors. This cancer-specific hospital was established to provide the many patients in Jordan with care comparable to that offered in the West. To honor the late King Hussein, who had died of cancer, the center was renamed the King Hussein Cancer Center in 2002. In 2006, Mahmoud Sarhan became the director general and CEO of the King Hussein Cancer Center. Dr. Sarhan, a former professor of pediatrics in the Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Transplantation Program at Duke University, was an instrumental figure in the center‚Äôs establishment. He founded KHCC's bone marrow transplantation (BMT) program in 2003, a program which has become one of the largest and most successful BMT programs in the Middle East. It is one of the largest (performing approximately 100 bone marrow transplants each year) and most successful programs in the Middle East, achieving cure rates compatible with international standards. The program oversees both matched allogeneic and autologous transplants and performs transplants utilizing cord blood, making it the only program in Jordan and the second in the region that offers such a highly specialized procedure. Other non-cancer cases are also treated through the KHCC BMT program including thalassemia, aplastic anemia and other metabolic diseases.

The main objectives of the program are to reduce morbidity and mortality from breast cancer through awareness campaigns, early detection and access to screening for all women in Jordan in order to shift the current state of diagnosis to the early stages of the disease, when it is most curable with high survival rates. JBCP‚Äôs operations are managed by an executive board led by KHCC and KHCF which provides its direction and ensures the implementation of action plans. Princess Dina Mired, director general of KHCF and Dr. Mahmoud Sarhan, director general of KHCC, together chair the Jordan Breast Cancer Committee and the executive board. In 2010, the King Hussein Cancer Center and the American University of Beirut Medical Center signed a memorandum of understanding to create a joint program in research.

One-act plays were unfashionable in the 1920s and 30s, but Coward was fond of the genre and conceived the idea of a set of short pieces to be played across several evenings. The actress most closely associated with him was Gertrude Lawrence, and he wrote the plays as vehicles for them both. The play portrays the chance meeting, subsequent love affair, and eventual parting of a married woman and a physician. The sadness of their serious and secretive affair is contrasted throughout the play with the boisterous, uncomplicated relationship of a second couple. Still Life differs from most of the plays in the cycle by having an unhappy ending. The play was first produced in London in May 1936 and was staged in New York in October of that year. It has been revived frequently and has been adapted for television and radio and, as Brief Encounter, for the cinema. Background and first productions Short plays had been popular in the previous century, often as curtain-raisers and afterpieces to longer plays. By the 1920s they had gone out of fashion, but Coward was fond of the genre and wrote several early in his career.Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 25‚Äì27 and 52 He wrote, \\"A short play, having a great advantage over a long one in that it can sustain a mood without technical creaking or over padding, deserves a better fate, and if, by careful writing, acting and producing I can do a little towards reinstating it in its rightful pride, I shall have achieved one of my more sentimental ambitions.\\"Quoted in Morley (2005), p. 66 In 1935 he conceived the idea of a set of short plays, to run in varying permutations on three consecutive nights at the theatre. His biographer Philip Hoare describes it as \\"a bold idea, risky and innovative\\".Hoare, p. 268 Coward finished writing all ten of the plays by the end of August 1935.Morley (1974), p. 188; and Hoare, p. 269 The actress most closely associated with Coward was Gertrude Lawrence, his oldest friend, with whom he had first acted as a child in Hannele in 1913.Hoare, pp. 27, 30 and 51 They starred together in his revue London Calling! (1923) and his comedy Private Lives (1930‚Äì31),Morley, (1999), p. viii; and Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 209 and 217 and he wrote the Tonight at 8.30 plays \\"as acting, singing and dancing vehicles for Gertrude Lawrence and myself\\".Quoted in Mander and Mitchenson, p. 283 Coward directed the plays as well as acting in them. They were performed in various combinations of three. Most of the plays in Tonight at 8.30 were tried out in a pre-London tour, but three, including Still Life, were first given after the cycle opened in London. Still Life was first presented on 18 May 1936 at the Phoenix Theatre, the second play in a programme that also contained Ways and Means and Family Album.Mander and Mitchenson, p. 313; and \\"Theatres\\", The Times, Coward had thought of using the title Still Life before ‚Äì for the American production of his 1925 comedy Hay Fever, although in the event it was given under its original title.\\"In the Spotlight\\", The Sunday Star, 13 September 1925, p. 72; and \\"Majestic\\", The Daily News, 27 September 1925, p. 46 The cycle played to full houses, and the limited season closed on 20 June, after 157 performances.Morley (1974), p. 192 The Broadway premiere was at the National Theatre on 24 November 1936, with mostly the same cast as in London. As in the London premiere, the programme also included Ways and Means and Family Album.Mander and Mitchenson, p. 283 The New York run of the cycle, a limited season, as in London, ended prematurely because Coward was taken ill. Still Life is one of the two plays in the cycle that end unhappily; the other is The Astonished Heart. For their premieres Coward placed each in the middle of its triple-bill, with a comedy before and after.Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 282‚Äì283 Roles and original cast *Alec Harvey ‚Äì No√´l Coward *Laura Jesson ‚Äì Gertrude Lawrence *Myrtle Bagot ‚Äì Joyce Carey *Beryl Waters ‚Äì Moya Nugent *Young Man ‚Äì Charles Peters *Stanley ‚Äì Kenneth Carten *Albert Godby, ticket collector ‚Äì Alan Webb *Bill, a soldier ‚Äì Edward Underdown *Johnnie, a soldier ‚Äì Anthony Pelissier *Mildred ‚Äì Betty Hare *Dolly Messiter ‚Äì Everley Gregg (Joan Swinstead in New York) Plot The play's five scenes are set across the span of a year, from April to March. It charts the love affair between Laura Jesson, a housewife, and Alec Harvey, a married physician. The location is the refreshment room of \\"Milford Junction\\" railway station. In the first scene, Myrtle, who runs the station buffet, rebuffs the attempts of Albert, the ticket-inspector, to flirt with her. Laura is waiting for her train home after shopping. She is in pain from a piece of grit that has been blown into her eye. Alec introduces himself as a doctor and quickly removes it for her. She thanks him and goes to catch her train. Three months later, Alec and Laura are once more in the refreshment room. It becomes clear that after their first meeting they encountered each other a second time by chance and have enjoyed each other's company to the extent of arranging to lunch together and go to the cinema. There have been several such meetings. Laura is beginning to wonder about the propriety of meeting him so often, but Alec reminds her that he too is married, with children and other responsibilities. In the third scene, set in October, Albert and Myrtle continue their slightly combative flirtation. Alec and Laura come in, and over coffee they admit that they are in love with each other. They are both determined not to upset their happy marriages, but will meet secretly. They make arrangements to meet at the flat of a friend of Alec. By December, they are both agonised by guilt and agree that their affair must stop. Alec tells Laura that he has been offered an attractive medical post in South Africa and will accept it unless she asks him not to. The fifth and final scene is set in March. Albert seems to be making progress with Myrtle. Alec and Laura enter. He is leaving to take up his new post in South Africa, and she has come to see him off. They are prevented from having the passionate farewell they both yearn for when Dolly, a talkative friend of hers intrudes into their last moments together, and their final goodbye is cruelly limited to a formal handshake. He leaves, and Laura remains, while Dolly talks on. Suddenly, as the sound of the approaching express train is heard, Laura suddenly rushes out to the platform. She returns \\"looking very white and shaky\\".Coward, p. 380 Dolly persuades Myrtle to pour some brandy for Laura, who sips it. The sound of their train is heard, and Dolly gathers up her parcels as the curtain falls. Reception Coward later said of the play, \\"Still Life was the most mature play of the whole series. ... It is well written, economical and well constructed: the characters, I think, are true, and I can say now, reading it with detachment after so many years, that I am proud to have written it.\\"Coward, unnumbered introductory page John Lahr, in his 1982 book on Coward's plays, disagreed: \\"when he wrote himself into the role of an ardent heterosexual lover ... the characterisation is wooden. The master of the comic throw-away becomes too loquacious when he gets serious, and his fine words ring false.\\"Lahr, p. 3 At the first production, critical opinion agreed with Coward. The Times called it \\"a serious and sympathetic study of humdrum people suddenly trapped by love\\" and strongly praised Coward both for the play and his performance.\\"Phoenix Theatre\\", The Times, 23 May 1936, p. 12 In a 1989 study of Coward, Milton Levin wrote: Levin suggests that when Laura rushes onto the platform as the express train thunders by she has suicide in mind; this possibility is made explicit in the film adaptation of the play, Brief Encounter.Ashby and Higson, p. 183 Revivals and adaptations=Theatre= A Broadway revival in 1967 starred Priscilla Morrill and Denholm Elliott as Laura and Alec.\\"Tonight at 8.30\\", Internet Broadway Database.

It lies northeast of the Gennargentu massif, traveling eastwards until it reaches the Tyrrhenian Sea at the Gulf of Orosei. It has an area of about 35,000 hectares, encompassing most of the territories of the comuni (municipalities) of Baunei, Dorgali, Oliena, Orgosolo and Urzulei. The populated areas of these comuni lie at the borders of the Supramonte, which, for the most part, is a largely uninhabited area of sharp limestone cliffs and deep, lush canyons. Geography Gorroppu Canyon Its highest peak is Monte Corrasi (1,463 m), and the average altitude of the chain is about 900 m. The Supramonte is characterized by Karstic highlands in which rivers have created deep ravines and canyons. The rivers flow mostly underground, creating several caves, such as the Grotta del Bue Marino, the Grotta di Ispinigoli (with the highest column in Europe, measuring 38 m), and the caves of Sa O'he (\\"The outlet\\", for the fact that there lies a little lake within, and it has a tributary river which pours out of the cave) and Su Bentu (\\"The Wind\\"). Springs such as Su Gologone can also be found. Other notable features on the range include the Plain of Donani'horo, the sinkhole of Su Sercone(in Orgosolo's language \\"Su Siel'hone\\"), the deep ravine of Gorropu and the limestone mountain of Monte Novo San Giovanni (1,316 m). The so-called \\"Supramonte Marino\\" (\\"Seaside Supramonte\\", to distinguish it from the inner \\"Supramonte Montano\\", \\"Mountain Supramonte\\") lies within the territories of Dorgali and Baunei, bordering the Gulf of Orosei and includes several renowned beaches (Cala Luna, Cala Sisine, Cala Mariolu, Cala Goloritz√©) that are often located at the end of deep valleys called codulas. Archeology In prehistoric times, the Supramonte area was more densely populated than it is today, as attested by traces of at least 76 villages, 46 nuraghes, 14 dolmens, 40 Giants' graves, 17 holy wells and 3 megalithic walls. Notable archeological sites include the village of Serra Orrios (located slightly north of the northern edge of the limestone lands), which contained about 70 circular huts and two megaron-like temples, and the nuraghe village of Tiscali, located in a strategically high position between the valleys of Lanaittu and Oddoene.

In an RT√â Radio 1 interview on The Marian Finucane Show in October 2008, FitzPatrick denied critics' charges that the bank had been reckless in making too many big loans to property developers as Ireland's property bubble grew. While saying he was grateful for the state's help, he refused to offer taxpayers an apology, saying FitzPatrick addressed the government in another speech on the same day and recommended cutting spending on what he called the \\"sacred cows\\" of Irish society: children, the elderly and health care. FitzPatrick was declared bankrupt on 12 July 2010.\\"FitzPatrick due to be declared bankrupt\\". 12 July 2010.  Early life  He was born in County Wicklow, Ireland. His father was a small farmer and his mother was a civil servant who left the workforce to raise her children. FitzPatrick's only sibling, his older sister, Joyce, would go on to become the sixth President of National College of Ireland. FitzPatrick was educated locally at Presentation College, Bray. Following this he attended University College Dublin.  Career  FitzPatrick was chief executive of Anglo Irish Bank from 1986 until 2005, when he became its chairman. He resigned from that position in December 2008 when details of secret loans he had taken out with the bank were revealed. FitzPatrick was appointed to a number of positions by Fianna F√°il politicians.

FitzPatrick, while Anglo Irish chairman, had borrowed more than ‚Ç¨100 million from the bank and hid the loans from auditors for eight years. The former multi-millionaire banker defaulted on the loans following a series of major business setbacks, valuable shareholding in Anglo Irish Bank once worth ‚Ç¨80 million is now worthless followed by a failed oil venture in Africa and a stake in a casino in Asia stalled. His property investments in Ireland and Hungary were also hit by the international slump. Both FitzPatrick and the bank said in statements on his resignation that his handling of the loans was neither illegal nor a breach of Irish banking regulations. But an apologetic new chairman O'Connor told shareholders that FitzPatrick's loans were \\"wrong and unacceptable\\". The following day, headlines in the Irish papers illuminated the popular mood: \\"Se√°n FitzPatrick Should Go To Jail\\" competed with \\"If FitzPatrick Lived in New York, He'd Have Been Arrested By Now\\". When he resigned from Anglo Irish Bank, Fitzpatrick also resigned his non-executive directorships at Greencore, Aer Lingus, Experian, Smurfit Kappa, and Gartmore Irish Growth Fund. = Arrests and acquittal = On 16 March 2010 Garda√≠ were given a warrant to search Se√°n Fitzpatrick's house. FitzPatrick was arrested at around 06:30 on 18 March 2010 at his house in Greystones, County Wicklow. He was arrested by the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation. He was questioned under Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984. Under this he was able to be held for up to six hours without charge, but this was later extended. The Garda√≠ were also assisting another investigation by the Director of Corporate Enforcement for breach of company law. The Garda√≠ confirmed in a statement that \\"There is an extensive Garda investigation under way, eager to see justice take its course\\" In most western countries it is illegal to run a business and seek investment while insolvent. It was not confirmed by the Garda√≠ at first if FitzPatrick was the person in their custody, but by an independent source and RT√â. Following the arrest, without naming FitzPatrick, the Minister for Finance Brian Lenihan commented on the situation. After more than 24 hours of questioning, he was released without charge on 19 March 2010. A file was prepared for the Director of Public Prosecutions. On Friday 9 December 2011, Fitzpatrick was arrested a second time by Garda√≠, allegedly as part of an investigation into \\"Financial Irregularities at a Financial Institution\\". On 24 July 2012, Fitzpatrick was arrested a third time by Garda√≠, allegedly as part of an investigation into \\"Financial Irregularities at a Financial Institution\\" He was charged with 16 offences by Garda√≠ attached to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement relating to his role in advising on and lending millions to a golden circle of investors to falsely inflate Anglo's share price.

Withdrawals from the MSA are tax-free if used to pay for qualified medical expenses. The MSA must be coupled with a high-deductible health plan (HDHP). Withdrawals from MSA go toward paying the deductible expenses in a given year. MSA account funds can cover expenses related to most forms of health care, disability, dental care, vision care, and long-term care, whether the expenses were billed through the qualifying insurance or otherwise. Once the plan deductible is met in a given year, the HDHP will pay any remaining covered medical expenses in that year. If there are funds remaining in the MSA at the end of the year, the funds can either roll over for the following year or can be withdrawn as taxable income. MSAs are similar to health savings accounts (HSAs), which were established as part of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. History The idea of the MSA appears to have come from entrepreneur Stephen Wischweh - he was concerned about the problem of overinsurance. He reasoned that overinsurance was raising the cost of health care expenses. He further reasoned that if patients (as opposed to third-party payers) paid their own medical expenses, then the cost of health care would decrease. Mr. Wischweh contrived this novel approach to consumer- driven healthcare while running an Illinois healthcare brokerage in the late 1980s, American Benefit Consultants. In the early-mid 1990s Stephen implemented his revolutionary healthcare principle through his Florida insurance company, Proweh Health Systems Inc (Clearwater, FL). Stephen Wischweh died in 1998 from cancer, but his ultimate vision of Flex Spending Accounts is now widely used throughout the United States and beyond. During the early 1990s, think tanks such as the National Center for Policy Analysis and insurance companies such Golden Rule Insurance Company began to promote passage of a law that would allow for tax-free contributions to a medical savings account. Even though the US Congress was under Republican control and the MSA concept was central to the Republican Party's health care agenda, a federal MSA law failed to materialize during the 1990s. However, Congress did pass an MSA pilot as a part of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in 1996. In the meantime, some states also pass MSA legislation. Missouri was the first state to do so in 1993. By 1998, 25 states had some form of MSA legislation offering a state tax break to those who open MSAs. The MSA for the self-employed person or business is now called an 'Archer MSA' by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The 'Archer MSA' term refers to the sponsor of the HIPAA amendment creating the accounts in 1996, Congressman Bill Archer of Texas. The Archer MSA is considered an IRS pilot program that must be extended by the US Treasury Department on a periodic basis. = Purpose and advantages = The Archer MSA is intended to be used by self-employed individuals and small businesses with fewer than 50 employees. The plan is entirely self-directed, including its initial setup and compliance with the plan thresholds. The plan enables a participant dual to fund a tax- exempt account for medical expenses incurred before an associated 'high deductible' insurance plan begins to cover those expenses. The individual pairs the MSA with a 'catastrophic insurance' plan, which has lower premiums than plans with lower deductibles. The individual deposits funds in the MSA to cover medical expenses; these deposits are exempt from income tax. Any money added to the account can roll over to another year if unused. MSAs are investment accounts, they can accumulate over the deductible level, can be used for qualified investments, and grow tax free. The MSA account may be convertible into a standard IRA savings plan after a specified age threshold is reached. The amounts contributed for medical savings do not impose a cap on standard IRA contributions. Among the medical expenses that can be paid out of an MSA account are premiums for long-term care coverage, health care coverage paid while receiving unemployment benefits, or any form of health care continuation coverage required under any federal law. The risk is that an MSA account holder may find that their medical expenses outstrip the contributions they can afford to make. = Sources = The MSA is generally a defined trust account that is set up solely as an IRS-related, tax-exempt financial instrument for medical expense purposes. However, after a contributor attains a certain age, current IRS provisions allow this account to be maintained as a standard IRA retirement account.  Qualifications  There are very specific qualifications to be met before making any contributions and in part those are performed using a worksheet in the IRS Form 8853 instructions. Qualified medical expenses are essentially those that would qualify for the medical and dental expenses deduction. These are discussed in IRS Publication 502. Other personal conditions, such as a period of non-employment as a self- employed individual, allow the payments for the high deductible insurance policy itself to qualify to be paid from the plan. = Future of the Archer MSA Program = In 2003, the health savings account was created. Since HSAs are a more widely available version of the MSA the original program is by and large obsolete. The exception to this is the state of California where MSA contributions are deductible on a state level and HSA contributions are not. Since the Archer MSA is a pilot program, it must be extended periodically by the US Treasury Department. The present extension of the program ended December 31, 2007. The US Treasury did not extend the program beyond this point, and as a result no new Archer MSAs may be opened. Current accounts can either be left open as is or converted to an HSA. At this time there are no financial institutions opening new MSAs. This is because of the creation of the Health Savings Account (HSA) in 2003. The HSA is available to everyone who participates in a qualifying High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP), not just the self-employed or small corporations.

Each has a hall with four well proportioned rooms on each side. On the first floor the dining room and the library are on opposing sides. The third floor consists of a front attic and two ample rooms. The staircase which connects all three floors is cantilevered from the walls, with no visible support. Originally, the kitchen was separated from the house by an open porch. It was a two-story building, with the second floor being used by transient workers and as a nursery. The roof tiles had been replaced four times from its construction in 1815 to 1972. In the 1930s amenities were added to the house, which included running water, electricity, baths, and furnaces. Two other buildings are part of the property. One is a heated outhouse large enough for two rooms. The other is a two-story brick building the Wickliffe family lived in before the construction of Wickland. History Wickland was built between 1813 and 1817 for Charles A. Wickliffe, a Whig member of the Kentucky House of Representatives. Wickliffe used plans by John M. Brown and John Rogers. From September 27, 1839 to September 2, 1840 Wickliffe served as governor of Kentucky. Wickliffe's son Robert C. Wickliffe was governor of Louisiana from 1856 to 1860. J. C. W.

Located around 85 km north of the capital Yerevan, the park was founded in 1931 by Polish engineer-forester Edmund Leonowicz. The arboretum is 35 ha in total of which 17.5 ha consist of natural forest and 15 ha of ornamental trees. Dendro Park at ArmeniaPedia.org  History  This collection expanded along the newly constructed footpaths and vistas which began to reach into the natural forest and is thought to be the first place in the Transcaucasus, where a natural forest landscape had been reshaped into a Forest Park. Most specimens were acquired from other botanic gardens as part of international exchange programmes with the Botanic Garden in Tbilisi (Georgia), Kiev (Ukraine), Nikitski, (Crimea, Ukraine), Leningrad and Moscow Central (Soviet Union) as well as the Far East. Specimens were also obtained further afield from Germany, France, Portugal, China and the United States. There are now more than 500 introduced species. Edmund Leonowicz (1902‚Äî1986) grave at Stepanavan Dendropark  Collection  The Stepanavan Dendropark consists of deciduous forest and ornamental plantings with avenues of Lime (Tilia cordata), and wild-sourced specimens of Juglans, Malus, Populus and Pyrus. The arboretum is home to a wide variety of trees, including Magnolia species, Larix decidua, Cypresses of various genera, Pinus sibirica, Cryptomeria japonica and Sequoiadendron giganteum. Among the native species are Carpinus caucasica, the Limes Tilia dasystyla and T. cordata, Fagus orientalis, the Elms Ulmus elliptica, Ulmus scabra and Ulmus foliacea, the Oaks Quercus macranthera, Quercus iberica and Quercus longipes, Pinus sylvestris var. hamata and Pyrus communis (note: Armenia is an important centre of pear diversity with over 20 known species). . During the operation of the arboretum, it tested the suitability for local conditions of about 2,500 taxa. Of this number of taxa introduced, around 500 species have survived and are growing in the garden. Seeds from the arboretum are spread throughout the world through Index Seminum published by Yerevan Botanical Garden. Mainly from the garden in Yerevan, there are also plants planted in the arboretum, imported from various regions of the former Soviet Union, but also China, Western Europe and North America.

It had been set up by Gerard Noel, with the help of several other interested witches. Presidency was first held by Sybil Leek, but after she was forced to emigrate to the United States after suffering persecution and being evicted from her home, it was taken over by Doreen Valiente, who had herself already been involved in several strands of neopagan witchcraft, including Gardnerian Wicca, Cochrane's Craft and the Coven of Atho. The WRA began publishing a magazine entitled Pentagram, the first issue of which came out in August 1964. History=Formation= In February 1964 Sybil Leek announced the formation of the Witchcraft Research Association, with herself as its first president. The historian Ronald Hutton suggested that its creation had been influenced by two recent events: the death of prominent Wiccan Gerald Gardner and a lecture tour by the historian Russell Hope Robbins in which Robbins had publicly criticised the Witch-cult hypothesis promoted by Margaret Murray. Leek's reputation was however damaged by press hostility and a strained relationship with other Wiccans, resulting in her resignation as President of the WRA in July and her emigration to the United States. The Presidency was taken up by Doreen Valiente. On 3 October 1964, the WRA held a dinner in which fifty Witches were present. At the dinner, Valiente gave an address in which she called for the reunification of what she believed where the many scattered remains of the Murrayite witch-cult across Britain. According to Hutton, \\"it was probably the first and last gathering in modern Pagan history where most of the men wore black ties and dinner jackets\\". Cochrane attended the event, as did the sympathetic journalist Justine Glass, who went on to write Witchcraft, the Sixth Sense ‚Äì and Us, published by Spearman in 1965. =The Pentagram newsletter= The WRA began production of a newsletter, Pentagram, which was edited by a friend of Robert Cochrane named Gerard Noel. In the first issue, Valiente included an article in which she expressed the hope that the WRA would become a \\"United Nations of the Craft\\", bringing together different Wiccan traditions in the spirit of unity. According to Hutton, \\"the Association fell at this initial hurdle.\\" In the next issue of Pentagram, an article was contributed by Cochrane, in which he echoed Valiente's call for a full study of the differing forms of the witch-cult, which in his view would reveal an ancient mystery religion which lay behind them. He extolled his own mystical interpretation of the religion as the most true, deeming it superior to others. However, one of Cochrane's friends, \\"Taliesin\\", also produced an article for the newsletter in which he claimed to be a member of a Goddess- focused hereditary tradition based in the West Country. In several articles published between May and December he extolled his own tradition and scornfully criticised others. In one of these articles he criticised Valiente's speech at the WRA dinner as exemplifying \\"the Gardnerian atmosphere of sweetness and light coupled with good clean fun under the auspices of a Universal Auntie\\". Hutton believed that this was probably the first appearance in print of the term \\"Gardnerian\\" to describe the followers of Gardner's Wiccan tradition. Two Gardnerians, Arnold Crowther and \\"Monsieur\\", responded to Taliesin's criticisms, to which he then retaliated with what Hutton called \\"an even nastier reply\\". Cochrane had encouraged \\"Taliesin\\" in his messages, which damaged the relationship between Cochrane and Valiente. She had little respect for \\"Taliesin\\"; conducting research into him, she found that he had no apparent connection to a West Country tradition, that he instead lived near to Cochrane in the Thames Valley, and that he had for a time been a member of Gardner's Bricket Wood coven. The Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White noted that a column on Halloween that was contained in the fifth issue of Pentagram featured the second oldest printed use of the term \\"Wicca\\" in reference to Pagan Witchcraft that he was aware of. Although the name of the column's author was not included, Doyle White speculated that it might have been Noel or Valiente. An advert for Pentagram was placed in the U.S. magazine Fate. The scholar of modern Paganism Chas S. Clifton suggested that Noel had chosen to advertise in Fate because it was the only magazine devoted to paranormal phenomena which was distributed nationally across the U.S. This advert introduced the American Witch Joseph Wilson to Pentagram, and on the basis of it he decided to establish his own American publication, The Waxing Moon: A Witchcraft Newsletter. Wilson began corresponding with Noel, who agreed to place an advert for The Waxing Moon in the final issue of Pentagram. This resulted in Cochrane opening a correspondence with Wilson. In his first letter, written on 20 December 1965, Cochrane asked Wilson if there were a system of ley lines in North America and claiming that the star on the Flag of Texas constituted proof that many of the British settlers who arrived in the Americas were witches. Their correspondence continued for another half year, being ended by Cochrane's suicide in the summer of 1966. The rancour between competing Wiccan factions severely damaged Pentagram, which folded in 1966, when the WRA also came to an end. Following the culmination of Pentagram, a group of British Gardnerians under the editorship of Dorset-based John Score replaced it with a newsletter titled The Wiccan, first issued in July 1968. In Clifton's view, The Wiccan represented a \\"successor\\" to Pentagram. \\"Taliesin\\" meanwhile was not publicly heard from again.

The flowers are racemose panicles, bear numerous small yellow flower heads or capitula, but the silvery white silky covering of down gives the foliage a grey or white appearance. Dhavanam has alternate pinnasect leaves (leaf which is divided into opposite pairs of lobes cut almost to the midrib In narrow divisions) or palmatisect leaves (the green tissue is divided into several segments not fully separated At the base). Cultivation It is commercially cultivated for its fragrant leaves and flowers. It has two distinct morphological types, one in which the plants are short in stature and flowering sets in early, and the other in which plants are tall and flowering sets in later. It grows from seeds and cuttings and reaches maturity in four months. The plant is woody in the lower part of the stem, but with yearly branches. Seen mostly grown in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu states in India. Artemisia pallens is a preferred food for the larvae of a number of butterfly species.

When the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) was built in 1858, St. Marys was served only by St. Marys Junction station, located 1.5 km north of the current station in an otherwise undeveloped area. Following pressure from local residents to provide a convenient station closer to the town centre, the GTR opened St. Marys Town station in 1879, located roughly 400 metres south of the current station where the railway crosses James Street South. However, residents were still not satisfied with the location, leading the GTR to construct the present St. Marys station in 1907, replacing St. Marys Town. In the 1980s, the Town of St. Marys acquired ownership of the station to protect it from possible closure or demolition. It completed a restoration and renovation of the station building, with an official reopening on 26 September 1988.

HospitalsElectronic health record Estonia is a pioneer in the use of Electronic health records because when general practice was moved out of hospitals in 1998 the records were kept in the hospitals, so GPs had to start their own system. Dr Madis Tiik established an electronic record system though it was officially illegal until 2002. He was a founder member of the eHealth Foundation and became its chief executive. There is now a central record system which is available to all healthcare professionals and can be viewed by the patient. Some tasks are automated, so that doctors do not have to certify that people are fit to drive. The application automatically checks their medical history. Estonia was the first country in the world that has implemented a nationwide EHR system, registering virtually all residents' medical history from birth to death. It was launched on 17 December 2008. Estonia used its existing digital public service software known as X-Road to create the EHR network. Estonia's system was overseen by the Ministry of Social Affairs until the creation of the Estonian e-Health Foundation. Since its implementation, 95% of health data has been digitized. Citizens that participate in the program are given an individual card that is used to access their records, like a national identification. The cost of this system has been ‚Ç¨7.50 per person at the time of creation. Costs can stay low due to Estonia's small population. The system is still too small to create proper diagnosis and track national statistics according to the National Audit Office. Along with e-Health records, Estonia has also created an e-Prescription service. It allows doctors to create an electronic prescription that is then added to a patient's health card and accessed at a pharmacy to receive the medicine they may require. Now 97% of prescriptions are digital in Estonia. Child support Upon giving birth, the Estonian government grants one of the parents 100% of their former salary for 18 months, plus 320 Euros of one-time support per child. After 18 months, the parent has the right to resume her/his former position. In addition, the parent and child receive free healthcare. Parents who did not work before giving birth (unemployed, students, etc.) receive 278 Euros a month; the top salary is capped at 2,157 Euros a month.Ministry of Social Affairs webpage on Parental Compensation .

PRAXIS analysis on the measure of Parental Compensation Those policy measures concentrate on the first 18 months of the child's life. After 18 months, the monthly state support to a child goes down to 19 Euros a month (for the first two children) and 58 euros (for three or more children), plus free healthcare. There are many exceptions and added bonuses to the rule. For example, the child of a single parent receives twice the sum of child support. The child of an army member receives five times the sum of the child support, and children in foster families receive 20 times the sum of the child support. Despite considerable variation and fluctuations in the support to the family with children, the majority of Estonian families do not face great hardships and the State of The World's Mothers 2011 report ranked Estonia as the 18th best country in the world to be a mother, ahead of countries like Canada and the United States.The 2011 Mothers' Index.

She is also described as \\"very loyal and duteously\\". A woman that defers her own needs for others. Luise's passion are planes and the flying. Her life as princess is characterized by etiquette and tradition.Personality - Cinefacts.de Mascha M√ºller said in one of her interview that she rewatched old recordings of Princess Diana to make her role believable and show how a real princess acts in front of the press and in public. Storylines=Luise and Gregor=Luise's arrival and meeting Gregor When Luise arrives in D√ºsseldorf she takes care of her father's business. Her father, Wilhelm von Waldensteyck (Michael Tietz), is mentioned to have serious health issues and Luise doesn't know if he will get any better any time soon. With the worry of her father she tries to stay strong and to not disappoint him. She hides her true feelings and is always smiling in front of the press and the Lahnstein family. Only when she is alone with her private secretary Maria Galdi, she shows parts of her true feelings and about her inner strife. Luise tries to have as much time for herself as she can, but that's difficult in the life of a real princess. When she takes a break from all in a park, she is photographed by some paparazzi when she cries. Luise runs away and finds herself on an unknown place. However, Luise falls and is found by Gregor Mann. He carries her in his arms, when she wakes up and is fascinated by her savior. She welcomes him with a hug and the words \\"my prince\\", which she later wished she could refused to have said and is embarrassed by it. Luise is excited when she sees that Gregor's hobby are planes and he is about to repair an old one. She sees it as a chance to maybe run away her traditional life for a few hours and help Gregor with his work. Gregor is skeptical, but agrees when Luise shows him that she knows her stuff and can be helpful to him. Even though Luise seems attracted to Gregor from the beginning, they start a work relationship. Luise introduces herself as \\"Katharina\\" to him - saying nothing about her title or what she is doing besides from their time together. Gregor seems fine with it and doesn't see Luise as a woman he could fall in love with. He rather sees her as a buddy that is working with him. They both can laugh a lot together and Gregor gets a little bit astonished sometimes when Luise doesn't know how to deal with the (for him) easiest things, such as making coffee or knowing that a vacuum bag needs emptying, otherwise it will burst. Currently Luise is married to Gregor Mann and is expecting their twin children to be born soon. It is because Luise went into apparent labour, that the couple were unable to attend Christian and Oliver's wedding.

Ingredients include black tea extract, Eleutherococcus senticosus, cardamom oil, eucalyptus oil, lemon oil, licorice, St. John's wort and laurel.  The History  Baikal's production started in 1969. It was developed as a Soviet counterpart of Coca-Cola. After the beginning of Pepsi Cola production in the USSR in 1973, the formula was revised. The drink was developed with Moscow 1980 Olympics in mind, as the western soda companies did not operate in USSR. The drink was named Baikal as a symbol of purity and unique nature. The Baikal's formula was redesigned after Pepsi entered USSR markets in 1973. Baikal was the official drink of Moscow olympics of 1980. In Moscow in the 1990s, it was nearly impossible to find Baikal; nevertheless, in Saint Petersburg the beverage's production was continued by the \\"Polustrovo\\" factory.

Responsibility for purchasing publicly financed health services lies with the Social Service Agency (SSA). Historical introduction From 1921 to 1991, the Georgian health system was part of the Soviet system. Till 1995 health care system in Georgia was based on Soviet Semashko model. The first dramatic change was implemented in 1995, when the budget transfers were complemented with additional sources of the financing: the mandatory health insurance contributions (employer and the employee mandatory contribution - 3% and 1% respectively), funds allocated for Healthcare from the territorial budgets, official co-payment for medical services, which could not be financed by the state programs.Gamkrelidze et al. 2002. \\"Health Care Systems in Transition: Georgia.\\" European Observatory on Health Care Systems. Vol.4, No.2. Mandatory social health insurance was abolished after the 2003-2004 Rose Revolution. In 2003, the social insurance tax was replaced by social tax, which was accumulated in the state budget and from 2007 the GoG decided to delegate management of state allocations for health insurance for targeted groups of population (the poor, teachers, law enforcement officers and military personnel (or about 40% of the population), to the private insurance companies, which have become the health service purchaser for the mentioned population groups. This meant that a portion of the population could not access health insurance.

Following extensive privatization and decentralization, most providers in primary and secondary level are private for-profit entities in terms of ownership, governance and management. Many of them are vertically integrated with private health insurance providers and pharmaceutical companies. The development of professional medical associations in Georgia is still at an early stage although there are many of them in existence. Since 2005, the major activity of professional associations has been supporting the MoLHSA in its endeavor to elaborate national clinical practice guidelines and protocols. Numerous international partners such as WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, World Bank, USAID, EU, Global Fund, etc. strongly support the health sector in Georgia. =Financing= Georgia entered the 1990s with a wholly tax-funded healthcare system, but reforms in 1995 replaced this system with a social insurance model run through the State Medical Insurance Company Under the social insurance model, basic healthcare was paid for by the state insurance company, with additional funds coming from Municipal Health Funds and preventative activities provided by the Ministry of Labor, Health, and Social Affairs [2]. In 2003, after the \\"Rose Revolution\\" the social insurance tax was replaced by social tax, which was accumulated in the state budget (social tax has been abolished since 2008). Since 2005, state health programs are financed under the budget assignations only.Chanturidze, et al. 2009. ‚ÄúGeorgia: Health system review.‚Äù Health Systems in Transition 2007 can be considered as the new phase of the Reform, as the government of Georgia decided to delegate management of state allocations for health insurance for targeted groups of population (the poor, teachers, law enforcement officers and military personnel), to the private insurance companies, which have become the health service purchaser for the mentioned population groups. Therefore, if till 2007 administration of personal health service purchases was carried out by the single payer state agency, from 2007 health care services are partially purchased by private insurance companies, which provided administration of more than half of state resources allocated for state health care programs by 2012 Chanturidze, et al. 2009. ‚ÄúGeorgia: Health system review.‚Äù Health Systems in Transition.. In February 2013, the Government of Georgia launched the UHC Program, which marked a significant shift in how health care is financed and health services are purchased in Georgia, as well as the culmination of nearly two decades of health system reforms in Georgia. The UHC Program extended publicly financed entitlement to health care coverage to the entire population. The nature of the program is noncontributory, in the sense that Georgians do not have to contribute for enrollment. Enrollment involves registering with the primary care provider of choice. The benefits package covers a range of primary and secondary care services and limited essential drugs. Administratively, the reform transferred responsibility for purchasing health care services from private insurance companies to the SSA under MoLHSA, thus putting in place a platform to shift from passive to active purchasing [11]. The health financing reforms introduced since 2013, and backed up by significant increases in public health spending, have moved Georgia closer to European norms. These include: (i) near universal population entitlement to publicly financed health care; (ii) free visits to family doctors; (iii) referral and prescribing systems; (iv) a single purchasing agency; and (v) higher public spending on health. Sustaining the coverage achieved to date and deepening coverage through better financial protection against OOP costs are the policy priorities for the Government of Georgia. Total health spending in Georgia‚Äìat 8.5 percent of GDP in 2015 is much higher than the average for upper-middle-income countries (7.0 percent) and approaching the EU average (10 percent). From 2012 to 2015, the health budget more than doubled, increasing from 5.3 percent to 8.6 percent of total government spending, and as a percentage of GDP from 1.7 percent to 2.9 percent. In this respect, Georgia is experiencing a steep increase in its health sector spending, which is consistent with other middle-income countries‚Äô experience at the time of UHC introduction. Public spending on health in Georgia is mainly drawn from general tax revenues and allocated to the UHC Program and vertical programs, all of which are administered by the SSA.Ministry of Labour, Health and Social Affairs of Georgia. National Health Accounts 2001-2015 Despite rising public spending on health, OOP remains the dominant source of financing for health in Georgia, filling the void of health spending that is not covered through public sources. OOP spending in Georgia is decreased and estimated to be 57 percent of all health spending (73% in 2012).Ministry of Labour, Health and Social Affairs of Georgia. National Health Accounts 2001-2015 Criticisms There is an extremely high number of doctors per capita in Georgia compared with other European countries, and it had 573.3 physicians per every 100,000 people in 2015.

The Universal health Care program covers the planned outpatient, urgent outpatient-in-patient and planned surgical services, as well as the treatment of oncological diseases and delivery.World Bank Group. 2017. Georgia Public Expenditure Review The research carried out by the World Bank, the World Health Organization and the US Agency for International Development revealed the main achievements of the Universal health Care Program: increased access to medical services, increased use of medical services, and reduction of financial barriers and expansion of coverage. In the publication of European Health Report 2015 of World Health Organization's European Bureau, Universal Health Care Program in Georgia has been recognized as the successful project. From May 2017 to further reform of the program, it was expedient to elaborate new criteria for differentiation of beneficiaries. The basic object of reform is to provide services more oriented on need and to develop the approach -\\"social equity\\". The services package is connected to the income of the population. From July 1, 2017 for people with chronic illnesses who are registered in the unified database of \\"socially unprotected families\\" and their rating score is not exceeding 100 000, have been enacted state program for providing medicines for chronic diseases. The program envisages providing patients with number of medicines for cardiovascular chronic illnesses, lung chronic diseases, diabetes (type 2) and thyroid gland diseases.

Life and times Leonardo Henrichsen was born to Swedish civil engineer Kjell Henrichsen from Gothenburg and an English Argentine mother in Buenos Aires. Given a film camera as a gift during childhood, he secured an apprenticeship in Sucesos Argentinos, the premier producer of newsreels in Argentina since its establishment in 1938. Mentored by Polish photojournalist Tadeo Bortnowski, Henrichsen was influenced by his teacher's experience as a war correspondent during World War II. Following Sucesos Argentinos' closure in 1955, Henrichsen was hired by Channel 13 Public Television, where he eventually became a leading international news cameraman. He married Patricia Mac Farlane in 1962, with whom he had three children. The violent 1964 coup against Dominican Republic President Juan Bosch became the first coup d'√©tat Henrichsen covered in that capacity. His coverage of the 1969 Argentine student/labor uprising known as the Cordobazo (whose first serious incidents erupted on his 29th birthday) brought Henrichsen to the attention of SVT, Swedish Public Television, and he was hired later in 1969.Clar√≠n SVT enlisted Henrichsen, who had covered 14 violent coups for their current events program, Rapport, to their bureau in Santiago, Chile. Working with chief correspondent Jan Sandquist, his first assignment there was during a massive, October 1972 truckers' strike in protest over the program of expropriations being advanced by Chile's Socialist President, Salvador Allende. On the morning of June 29, 1973, the day of the attempted military coup known as the Tanquetazo, as Henrichsen had breakfast at the caf√© in the Hotel Crill√≥n (across La Moneda Presidential Palace in downtown Santiago), the sound of gunfire erupted outside, leading him and Sandquist to rush to cover the event. As he began filming, a detachment in a mutineering army regiment attempting to storm La Moneda Palace attacked protesters and bystanders nearby and, noticing him and his camera, the ranking officer, Corporal H√©ctor Bustamante G√≥mez shot his pistol at Henrichsen, prompting his men to fire, as well. Appealing to them that they cease firing at two journalists, Henrichsen was struck by the third shot (from an as yet unidentified conscript), causing him to collapse in Sandquist's arms while still filming. He was 33.Memoriando This happened two weeks before Henrichsen was supposed to go on his first ever trip to Sweden and to his father's home town of Gothenburg. Corporal Bustamante visibly attempted to destroy the evidence, seizing Henrichsen's √âclair 16 II camera and pulling the film out. The √âclair, however, possessed a second, backup chamber, where the event remained recorded and from which Sandquist was able to distribute the footage on July 24.Pagina/12 Lieutenant Colonel Roberto Souper and the other participants in the failed coup attempt against President Allende were given refuge in the Embassy of Ecuador (whose dictatorship was hostile to Allende). Promoted to a high-ranking post within Chile's intelligence services (DINA) following the September 11, 1973, coup against Allende, Souper continues to enjoy impunity and Corporal Bustamante had no charges brought against him until his role in the murder was confirmed by Chilean documentarian Ernesto Carmona in January 2005, following his 7-year long investigation. Josephine and Andr√©s Henrichsen (the journalist's daughter and son) filed a wrongful death suit against Corporal Bustamante on October 28, 2005. Chilean criminal court Judge Rommy Rutherford ruled that the case had expired its statute of limitations, though after reviewing the case, Chilean Appellate Court Judge Jorge Zepeda Arancibia ordered a reopening of the investigation into the deaths of Leonardo Henrichsen and three other Argentines murdered there in 1973.

Pop lets Bernie out only to stalk and harm campers while Pop helps himself to their belongings. Not far away, a group of young people are preparing for two weeks of wilderness training. The camp is run by Regis, and his crazy girlfriend, Marcie, who tells them that P.J., a new camper has disappeared. We find out that the P.J., is dead. Meanwhile, the police are trying to piece together what happened to the tourist family when an old police officer, Taylor, shows up. He recognizes Pop, remembering how Bernie went on a murderous rampage years ago. Unable to convince the others, he heads for the wilderness camp on his own. By the time he arrives, it is too late. Bernie has already done his dirty work. As Taylor hunts for Bernie, it is a heart-stopping and frightening game of kill or be killed.

The history of IBM research in Israel dates from 1972 with the establishment of the IBM Haifa Research Lab. The research lab is located in a custom-built complex on the University of Haifa campus, with branches in Haifa and Tel Aviv. The staff at the IBM Haifa Research Lab works on projects connected to the topics of healthcare, cloud computing, formal and image and video analytics among others. Overview At the IBM Haifa Research Lab, 25% of the technical staff have doctoral degrees in computer science, electrical engineering, mathematics, or related fields. Employees are actively involved in teaching at Israeli higher education institutions such as the Technion (Israel Institute of Technology) and supervising post-graduate theses. Many employees have received IBM awards for achievements and excellence. Over the years, the IBM Haifa Research Lab in Israel described itself as attempting to strike a delicate balance between applied (relatively short-term) and long-term industrial research. While contributing to product development on many levels, the Lab also maintains close ties to the academic world. The Lab aims to simultaneously meet the needs of the present day while helping shape the future of information technology. Since its establishment in 1972, the IBM Haifa Research Lab described itself as trying to be responsive to both the research goals of IBM and the specific needs of Israeli industry ‚Äì from medical non-invasive diagnosis projects, to computer-controlled irrigation, scheduling El Al flight crews, and Hebrew voice recognition. Today, its contributions play a role in emerging technologies such as IBM's eLiza project for self-managing computer systems, iSCSI for the IBM TotalStorage IP Storage 200i, the InfiniBand high bandwidth network protocol, Enterprise Storage Systems, and information retrieval engines. In addition, verification tools developed in Haifa are used throughout IBM labs to verify and test software and hardware. Beginnings In 1971‚Äì73, Dr Alfred Inselberg (AI) from the IBM Los Angeles Scientific Center was on sabbatical leave at the Technion's new department of Applied Mathematics. In 1972, Shimon Yagil contacted AI explaining that IBM Israel was looking for ways to increase IBM's presence in Israel. He asked AI to make presentations on IBM's Scientific Centers and write a proposal for such a Scientific Center in Israel. David Cohen, general manager of IBM Israel, and others attended the presentations and enthusiastically endorsed the proposal which eventually IBM World Trade accepted. This was the genesis of the idea. Prof. Phillip Rabinowich lobbied for IBM's center to be at the Weizmann Institute. However, the Scientific center was established at the Technion, as promoted by Shimon and AI, so that the undergraduate and graduate students there will learn about IBM's scientific activities. The concept of establishing a research center for IBM in Israel was the idea of the late David Cohen, then general manager of IBM Israel, and the late Prof. Josef Raviv, an Israeli computer scientist who headed a research group at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center in New York City. Raviv was active in the growth of the IBM Haifa Research Lab in Israel. In 1971, Raviv spent a year on sabbatical in Israel (apparently this is an error, Raviv was NOT on sabbatical in Israel in 1971 -- see above), where he met with Cohen. They convinced IBM management to open a center in Israel, modeled after the Scientific Centers in the United States, England, Germany, France and Italy. These centers described themselves as non-profit organizations whose goals were to promote the development of computer science and utilize advanced technology to solve problems critical to the local community. Raviv, Cohen and IBM said that with its international reputation for scientific research, a pool of talented researchers, and the support of advanced research institutions, Israel offered an attractive environment for research and development operations. This was a groundbreaking step. At the time, beyond the military industry, the field of hi-tech seemed to be almost non-existent in Israel, and computing appeared to be just starting to gain momentum in academic institutions. In 1972, the IBM Israel Scientific Center opened its doors in the Computer Science Building of the Technion, with a handful of employees: Raviv as manager, three researchers, and one programmer. Early collaborative projects Using the Technion's computing facilities, the Center embarked on projects in the fields of medicine, agriculture, economics, computer sciences, and applied mathematics in computer applications. At first, the Center said its work was done in cooperation with Israeli public and academic research groups. Teams composed of Scientific Center personnel and research partners worked on joint projects, and their results were published in the public domain, as per IBM guidelines for all Scientific Centers. This may have turned out to be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, the focus on projects had the potential to make a difference for the country without having to make direct return-on-investment considerations. On the other hand, researchers said they were frustrated by the inability to see their work mature into practical implementation and use. Joint Ventures across the Oceans In the late 1970s, Raviv began searching for ways to expand the Scientific Center's activities. He approached other Scientific Centers in Europe about conducting joint research projects. One of these was a project in farm management, in collaboration with the Madrid Scientific Center. This allowed the Haifa team to buy their first computer. It was a 5110‚Äîa portable computer roughly the size of a suitcase. The research team implemented algorithms on this machine and carried it from one kibbutz (collective farm) to another, to solve their individual irrigation problems. An important project was the development of an ultrasound system for the early detection of liver cancer, in conjunction with IBM Austria and Israel's Sheba Hospital. Although today ultrasound equipment is routinely used in a wide range of medical applications, at the time it was a relatively new technology. Haifa's expertise in signal processing was key to the development of this project. Another important project appears to have been computer assisted medical diagnosis ‚Äì a computer-based system to aid physicians in their diagnostic and treatment decisions in different medical fields. The project, headed by Bezalel Gavish, developed new artificial intelligence methods (production systems). The first area tested was endocrinology and infertility done in cooperation with the Sheba medical center, Tel hashomer. The project was later tested with a group at the Rotschild hospital in Haifa, Dutch Hospitals in the Netherlands. It was extended to other fields of endoctinology, to Congenital malformation, and to heart related issues. Due to collaborative projects such as these, the Scientific Center quickly became recognized as a focal point for research and development in engineering and scientific computing for IBM's European Scientific Centers. This facilitated the growth of the Center from fifteen to twenty-two employees. To accommodate its expansion, the Scientific Center moved to newer and larger premises in the Technion's Andre and Bella Meyer Advanced Technology Center in 1982. Research group opens in Haifa Raviv was still considering ways to expand the Center. As he searched for new avenues for cooperation, he hit on the idea of subcontracting to the IBM Research labs in the United States. He thought that perhaps the labs in the US could use specific skills to solve specific problems, and might be interested in working on a per-project basis. At the time, this was a radical idea, but as it took shape, Dr Ralph Gomory, Director of IBM Research, decided to sponsor the concept and created the Haifa Research Group (HRG) in 1982. This new activity began with only two projects‚Äîvendor chip testing and DAIOS (DASD I/O simulations)‚Äîand grew at an unprecedented rate. These two projects formed a core of activity that eventually led to the creation of the Haifa Research Lab's Verification Technologies and Storage System Technologies departments and to the Haifa Microelectronics Development Lab. In 1983, the Scientific Center and HRG came together under the roof of the Science and Technology Division of IBM Israel. It became a legal subsidiary of IBM Israel in 1989, which, at the time, was managed by Joshua Maor. Its major research and development projects in the 1980s included Hebrew computational linguistics (including text-to-speech synthesis for the blind), optimization of water distribution systems, computer-based education technology, portrait compression, signal processing for the hearing impaired, document recognition and processing, hand-written and printed text recognition, data compression and parsing techniques, and VLSI design verification, and testing tools. IBM as solutions provider During the late 1980s, the emphasis of the Scientific Center's work began to shift. IBM was phasing out its Scientific Centers as computing became more widely used. In Israel, a decision was made to change the focus of the Center's work to benefit IBM Israel by finding solutions for its customers. In 1992, the Israel Scientific Center formally became known as the Advanced Solutions Center of IBM Israel. In recognition of the value that the Center was bringing to IBM, in 1993, Dr Jim McGroddy, director of IBM Research, renamed it the IBM Haifa Research Laboratory. At the time, it was one of only three laboratories affiliated with the IBM Research Division outside of the United States, the others being Zurich and Tokyo. At the time, the Center had more than 250 employees; to accommodate its growing staff, HRL moved into Building 8/1 in the MATAM Advanced Technology Center at the southern tip of Haifa, not far from the Carmel Beach. During the 1990s, HRL's contributions to research and development were reflected in a variety of IBM products, such as the hardware and software for RS/6000 workstations, mathematical elementary functions for several IBM computers, consistent backup of data without interruption to active applications, and design verification of certain IBM products. HRL became the largest Research lab outside the United States. In 1999, on his 65th birthday, Raviv retired as director of HRL and began to pursue the establishment of an IBM development center in Israel. A few months later, he and his wife, Joanna, were killed in a car crash while on vacation in New Zealand. The development center planned by Raviv eventually became the Israel Systems and Technology Group (STG) Lab. The activities of the Israel STG Lab include storage technologies, high-speed networks, high-speed circuits, software/ hardware integration, and physical design of VLSI components. Collaboration with academia In its 30th year, the IBM Haifa Research Lab in Israel moved to a new home on the University of Haifa campus. From its vantage point on the Carmel mountain range, the building has views of the Mediterranean Sea and the city of Haifa. The researchers at the Lab teach at the Technion, the University of Haifa, and Tel Aviv University. They supervise student theses and undergraduate projects. Several staff members are also involved in special projects with academic institutions in Israel, the United States, and Europe, including collaborations with Purdue University, Bar-Ilan University, the University of Maryland, and numerous academic institutions throughout Europe. Today, the IBM Haifa Research Lab describes itself as having the highest number of employees in Israel's hi-tech industry who hold doctorate degrees in science, electrical engineering, mathematics, or related fields. Researchers participate in international conferences and are published in professional publications. The IBM Haifa Research Lab is part of the IBM R&D; Labs in Israel.

Muthiah Mudaliar CIE (1883 - 15 July 1953) was an Indian politician and legislator of the Justice Party and later, the Swarajya Party and an independent minister in the Madras Presidency. He is largely remembered for introducing the Communal Government Order implementing reservations in the Presidency. Muthiah Mudaliar was born in Kumbakonam. He studied and graduated in law and commenced practice as a lawyer. He joined the Justice Party and later, the Swarajya Party and served as legislator from 1923 to 1930. From 1928 to 1930, he served as the Minister of Education and Excise in P. Subbarayan's government. He returned to the Justice Party in the late twenties and participated in the Madras Anti-Hindi agitations of 1938. Muthiah Mudaliar was a close friend and associate of E. V. Ramasami Naicker.  Early life  Muthiah Mudaliar was born in Kumbakonam, Madras Presidency in 1883. Muthiah graduated from Government College, Kumbakonam and Law College, Madras and practised as a lawyer at the Madras High Court before joining the Justice Party.  Politics  In 1923, Muthiah left the Justice Party and joined the Swarajya Party. He participated in the 1923 assembly elections and was elected to the Madras Legislative Council. He was returned to the assembly in the 1926 elections but refused a ministry in accordance with the policies of the Swarajya Party not to participate in the dyarchy. However, he did not like the secret support that his colleagues in the Swarajya Party gave to the P. Subbarayan government. He felt that the assumption of a stance supportive to a government elected under dyarchy was an endorsement of dyarchy itself. He attended the Bombay session of the All India Congress Committee (AICC), at which he raised the issue. He recommended the creation of a committee to investigate this rebellious deeds of the Madras members of the Swarajya Party. However, the committee tabled a report the very next day announcing that the Madras members were not guilty of any anti-party activities. Muthiah dissented with the committee and left the Swarajya Party.  In the government  In 1928, when two of Subbarayan's ministers R. N. Arogyasamy Mudaliar and A. Ranganatha Mudaliar resigned, Subbarayan invited Muthiah to take over the portfolios of education and excise which Ranganatha Mudaliar had held. This time, Muthiah accepted the invitation and served as the Minister of Education and Excise in the independent ministry from 1928 to 1930. Muthiah Mudaliar is remembered for introducing the Communal G. O. Ms No. 1021 to implement the 1921 order. This act, introduced provisions for reservations for Dalits and increased representation for Indian Christians and Muslims. At the same time, it reduced the reservations for Brahmins from 22% to 16% and non-Brahmins from 48% to 42%. This act was in effect until India's independence on 15 August 1947. As Minister of Excise, Muthiah launched a Created Excise Propaganda Central Committee along with district committees in order to introduce and implement prohibition in the Presidency. He launched a massive propaganda campaign against consumption of liquor and allocated a record budget of Rs. 4 lakhs (400,000) for propaganda alone. This was probably the most costly propaganda campaign against drinking. Prohibition lasted throughout Subbarayan's tenure but was discontinued by the successor Justice Party regime. As late as August 1934, Rev. Herbert Naderson, Secretary of the Prohibition League, praised Muthiah's efforts at the Imperial Institute at London.  Death  Muthiah Mudaliar died on 15 July 1953, at the age of 70.  Legacy  Muthiah was regarded by his colleagues and followers as simple, practical and overzealous. He lived in the same house until his death. He was commended in the legislative assembly by India's first woman legislator, Muthulakshmi Reddy, for his efforts at women's empowerment such as introduction of a provision for a woman director for the public health department, increasing maternity and child welfare staff and for the provision of a government grant to the Red Cross health school.

Healthcare in Denmark is largely provided by the local governments of the five regions, with coordination and regulation by central government, while nursing homes, home care, and school health services are the responsibility of the 98 municipalities. Some specialised hospital services are managed centrally. Danish government healthcare expenditures amount to approximately 10.4% of the GDP, of which around 84% is funded from regional and municipal taxation redistributed by the central government. Because necessary healthcare is taxpayer-funded, personal expenses are minimal and usually associated with copayments for certain services. Those expenses are usually covered by private health insurance. Use of electronic health records is widespread, and efforts are underway to integrate these at the regional level. For every 1,000 people in Denmark, there are about 3.4 doctors and 2.5 hospital beds. Spending on hospital facilities, at 43% of total health care spending, is above the average for OECD countries, even though the number of beds has decreased considerably. Child vaccination coverage is over 90%. Mortality from heart disease decreased in the years up to 2015, while life expectancy increased. Healthcare administration=Central government= The central government plays a relatively limited role in health care in Denmark. Its main functions are to regulate, coordinate and provide advice and its main responsibilities are to establish goals for national health policy, determining national health legislation, formulating regulation, promoting cooperation between different health care actors, providing guidelines for the health sector, providing health and healthcare-related information, promoting quality and tackling patient complaints. In 1994, the Health Ministry created an agency that joined health care industry and providers to agree on systemwide software standards. The Danish Quality Model, based on the Institute for Quality and Accreditation in Healthcare was introduced in 2005 and run in cooperation between Danish Regions, the Ministry of Health, Health Protection Agency, KL, the Danish Pharmaceutical Association and the Danish Chamber of Commerce. In 2007, a reorganization gave general practitioners more duties while health care decision-making was centralized. In April 2015 it was announced by Health Minister Nick Haekkerup and President of Danish Regions Bent Hansen that it was to be abandoned. Hansen said \\"Quality work must be simplified and focused. The time has come to strengthen it by putting the patient at the centre, rather than focusing on compliance with a variety of standards. Accreditation has been justified and useful, but we move on. We need a few national targets to be met locally with strong commitment from the staff and with room for local solutions\\". The financial stability law introduced in 2012 means that all regions and municipalities must keep within 1.5% of their budgets. The Central government must also now approve the introduction of new specialist facilities or the closure of existing facilities. =Local government= The 5 regions are responsible for hospitals and general practitioners. They are financed mainly through income taxes. The 98 local communes have long had responsibilities for nursing homes and care services. Local political accountability to a population with a large proportion of elderly people means that these services get political attention. The level of satisfaction with the health system in 1997 was greater than in other EU countries, including some with larger health care expenditures per capita. In 1988, legislation a law was passed limiting the construction of new nursing homes and nursing homes were converted to single- occupancy rooms. From 1997 all new housing for older people was required to have at least a bedroom, sitting room, kitchen, and bath. The Skaevinge Municipality set up an Integrated Home Care project in 1984 which was evaluated by the Danish Institute of Health Care in 1997. Health care was made available to all citizens both in institutions and in their own homes and prevention and support to maintain and strengthen their health and quality of life were prioritised. They were involved in decision-making and the staff, working in small teams were given more autonomy. It was found that in 1997 40.8% of older people assessed their own health as good in comparison with 28.9% people of the same age in 1985. The number of days people over 67 spent in hospital fell by 30%. The nursing home was closed and became a hub for community support services which included a senior center, day care, rehabilitation, 24-hour home care, and assisted living organised in three geographical teams. Nursing home staff were guaranteed jobs in the new set up. This integrated approach was widely adopted in Denmark. Nursing homes and home care organizations were no longer staffed separately. Between 1985 and 1997 the number of nursing home beds in Denmark was reduced by 30%. =Electronic health records= Denmark does not have nationwide electronic health records. It is mandatory for primary care practices and hospitals to use EHRs. The Danish Health Data Network (Medcom) acts as a data integrator to ensure interoperability. Unfortunately, non-interoperability is an issue despite the high adoption rate. The five regions are attempting to address this problem by each setting up their own electronic health record systems for public hospitals. However, all patient data will still be registered in the national e-journal. Healthcare costs=Public healthcare funding= In 2016, the Danish healthcare expenditure amounted to $5,205 U.S. dollars per capita (approximately 10.4 percent of GDP), with around 84.0 percent of healthcare expenditure being funded by governmental or compulsory means. Healthcare in Denmark is largely financed through local (regional and municipal) taxation with integrated funding and provision of health care at the regional level. The money is then disbursed to be used by the five administrative regions of local government according to the guidelines set by the central government. =Private healthcare funding= According to the OECD, in 2016 the private healthcare expenditure in Denmark was $831 U.S. dollars per capita (approximately 1.7 percent of GPD). The private healthcare insurance aids in covering a variety of copayments not fully covered by public healthcare funding. Services provided=Primary care= Citizens of Denmark may choose between two different types of health insurance groups, 1 and 2. Most are in group 1, which includes the majority of general practitioners, who are paid on a combined capitation and fee-for-service basis in a similar way to those in the United Kingdom. The regions determine the number and location of general practitioners, and their fees and working conditions are negotiated centrally between the physicians' union and the government. The municipal health services provide health visitors, home nurses and school health care. There is 1 doctor for every 294 persons in Denmark. Citizens are assigned a specific general practitioner (GP) and may receive aid at no cost, including visiting a medical specialist at the referral of their GP. More than 99 percent of patients are covered by the insurance from group 1. Those who have the insurance provided by group 2 may visit any GP or medical specialist they wish, but may be subjected to copayments at their visit. Citizens with this type of insurance make up less than 1% of the population. =Secondary care= Hospital care is mainly provided by hospitals owned and run by the regions. This is similar to the model in other Scandinavian countries. Denmark has seen a decline in general acute care hospitals from 82 in 1997 to 52 in 2004. The number of hospital beds per 1000 people has also decreased from 4.64 in 1997 to 2.53 in 2015. According to the Danish Ministry of Health, the hospital sector is undergoing modernized restructuring by \\"merging specialised functions into fewer and larger units.\\" Unlike standard hospital services, which are run by the regions within the country, these specialised hospital functions are overseen by The Danish Health Authority. Denmark is one of the highest spenders in the OECD of spending of hospitals per capita, accounting for around 43% of total health expenditure, significantly above the 35% average in the OECD. In Danish hospitals, nurses and doctors dispense the drugs, not pharmacies. Nurses and doctors are not blocked off from each other's jurisdiction, nurses may prescribe medicine in emergencies and explain later. There are few private hospital providers, such as Danske Privathospitaler (DAPH), and they account for less than 1% of hospital beds. Performance of Danish healthcare Denmark has made dramatic advances in the reduction of heart disease mortality according to the Euro health consumer index. Life expectancy in Denmark has increased from 77.9 years in 2005 to 80.6 years in 2015. Danish women have a higher life expectancy (82.5 years in 2015) than Danish men (78.6 years in 2015). =eHealth= Denmark is one of the world's leaders in the use of health care technology. Virtually all primary care physicians have electronic medical records with full clinical functionality.D. Protti and I. Johansen. Widespread Adoption of Information Technology in Primary Care Physician Offices in Denmark: A Case Study. (The Commonwealth Fund, March 2010.) Practitioners use Electronic Medical Records (EMR) and Electronic Prescribing to exchange clinical messages (EDI) using the MedCom network. Despite the high adoption levels, for several years Denmark has suffered from eHealth system fragmentation that has led to eHealth's inability to reach its full potential in delivering quality healthcare services.Kierkegaard, P. (2013) eHealth in Denmark: A Case Study. Journal of Medical Systems, 37 (6) The Regions of South Denmark, Region North and Central Region Denmark have implemented modern and coherent EMR's with a number modules. The largest coherent EMR installation is in the Central Region of Denmark. The solution is delivered by the Danish company Systematic, and was centralized to be used in all 17 hospitals that have more than 20,000 users. In an attempt to unify their fragmented e-health network, the Zealand regions will begin using a common EMR in 2016, Epic. =Psychiatric care= Due to the expanding ability to diagnose and treat psychiatric problems, Denmark has enhanced its treatment system for those dealing with a psychiatric issue. According to the Danish Ministry of Health, the number of patients who have received psychiatric hospital services has increased 28 percent from 2009 to 2014. Denmark has also had a decline in its suicide rate by 13% from 2009 to 2015. =Vaccinations= The National Childhood Vaccination Program in Denmark provides vaccinations to children for many diseases, including diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping Cough. From 1980 to 2015, vaccination coverage for those diseases increased from 88% to 93% of the children in Denmark, and the nation has consistently maintained 90% coverage or more since 2010. Those aged 65+ also receive the influenza vaccine. Denmark vaccinated 41.9% of the population aged 65 or above in 2015, a drastic increase from 6.2% in 2002. The cost of vaccinations is covered by the regions, with the exception of vaccinations required for vacation travel.

It lies within the Vilnius Old Town elderate near Gediminas Hill and Gediminas Tower, and is part of the State Cultural Reserve of Vilnius Castles, established in 1997. The park hosts various events, including concerts, political rallies, and sporting competitions. Its name reflects the presence of four prominent hills (kalnai): Crooked Hill, Table Hill, Bekes Hill, and the Hill of Gediminas's Grave. History Archeologists have hypothesized that the Crooked Hill (also known as Bleak Hill and Three Crosses Hill) housed the wooden Crooked Castle, which was destroyed during the Lithuanian Civil War (1389‚Äì1392) and never rebuilt. This hill fort was damaged by erosion and by construction of fortifications during the 17th and 18th centuries. According to a legend, seven Franciscan friars attempting to convert Lithuania to Christianity were murdered there during the reign of Duke Algirdas. In some versions of the legend, three of the monks were crucified. Wooden memorial crosses and a chapel were erected at the site; the concrete Three Crosses were built in 1916. The crosses were torn down in 1950 by order of the Soviet government and replaced by the current monument in 1989. Table Hill is not well researched; in 1955 its top was bulldozed to make it perfectly flat. Bekes Hill was destroyed by erosion and was washed away by the Vilnia in 1838 and 1843. It was named after G√°sp√°r Bekes from Hungary (1520‚Äì1579), a military commander under Stephen B√°thory of Poland, who was buried on the hill (he was of Arianism faith and therefore refused admittance to other city's cemeteries). His grave was marked by an octagonal tower, in height and in diameter. Lithuanians plan to cooperate with the Embassy of Hungary to restore his memory in the park. The Hill of Gediminas' Grave is used by the reconstructionist-pagan Romuva church as a ritual site. According to legend, Gediminas, Grand Duke of Lithuania, was buried on the hill. While the territory may hold the key to the earliest history of Vilnius, no comprehensive archaeological research has been undertaken. Several small and isolated studies were conducted during various construction works in the park. In summer 2008, archeological excavations began in the so-called Valley of Songs, where a small settlement existed in the 13th and 14th centuries and where the Soviets built a stage for concerts in 1955‚Äì1956. The scientists uncovered the bodies of several German World War II prisoners.

The film marked his directorial feature debut. Plot Matthew (Emory Cohen) is a teenage boy in New York who has therapy together with his father Frank (Steve Schirripa), because of their troubled communication. The boy runs away during their session. Angela (Sharon Angela), his mother, is worried but Frank is more concerned with his radio show, and whether his techs got his vodka. He proceeds to use a great deal of cocaine as well before the show begins. Matthew goes to a park where a lot of homeless people are congregated, where he is picked up by a couple. They give him alcohol and drugs, after which the woman has sex with Matthew while the man watches. Nadia (Aunjanue Ellis) abandons her room because she's a month behind on her rent. She reconnects with an old friend from a yoga school, has sex with an old boyfriend, then leaves her yoga center friend's house when her friend becomes upset by her story of her relationship with Gus (Nick Sandow), her most recent lover. She has a meal on the stairs of a house. The woman living there comes home and tells her to leave, but Nadia refuses. The woman throws a bucket of water over her, and Nadia puts the bucket on the woman's head and beats on it. Gus is just getting out of a ninety-day rehab stint. He immediately goes out and gets drunk with an old man he meets in a restaurant. He calls Nadia again and again, but she won't answer his calls. He meets a woman named Lisette (Bess Rous), who it develops has been in the same meditation class which he and Nadia attended. He succeeds in unnerving, and then seducing her, but instead of following through on that, he tells her to go home by herself. Matthew calls his father, who refuses to pick him up because he's in the middle of his show. He is picked up by his uncle Joey (Joe Caniano). Once home, he won't say what happened, even though Angela tells him she won't get angry. He tries to kill himself, then Angela and Joey head up to the mountains with him to help him work out his distress. Frank, once he finds out what has happened, heads up to the mountains on a train, where he meets Nadia, who is fleeing the city. He begins to suffer chest pains, and Nadia calls for help; he's then gotten off the train. She is waiting for him when he comes out of the ER, and during a meal together, she encourages him to come to a meditation class with her. Lissette is in the class, but she and Nadia don't know each other, and don't speak. Frank begins to relax as the teacher leads them through guided breathing exercises. Gus, having first taken an overdose of pills, arrives, causing distress to Nadia and Lisette by his presence. He sits next to Nadia, who obviously doesn't want him there, but with a blissful smile, he lies down on the floor and closes his eyes.

The Basilica di Sant'Antioco of Bisarcio is a countryside church near Chilivani, a frazione of Ozieri, Sardinia, Italy. Located on an isolated volcanic hill, it is one of the largest Romanesque churches in Sardinia. A Catholic diocese with seat in Bisarcium, in what was then the giudicato of Torres (one of the four independent quasi-kingdoms in which Sardinia was divided) or Guisarchium is documented from 1065 to 1503, when it was annexed to that of Alghero. A first cathedral was built here in the late 11th century, but was later damaged by a fire, so that a document from 1139 suggests that the bishop had moved his seat to Ardara. The new cathedral was finished in 1174, when the two storey portico on the fa√ßade was completed. Today scanty remains of the medieval village of Bisarcio remain. Interior. Overview The church shows clear influences from the workers who were called to build it, and which belonged to the Lombard and Pisane schools. The portico, inspired by French models, has a lower storey with three rounded arcades, two of which included mullioned window (the left one closed). The middle arcade leads to the narthex, which has six groin vaults supported by cruciform piers. On the narthex' right side is a staircase leading to the upper floor with three rooms, the central of which, provided with an altar, was the private chapel of the bishops of Bisarcio. Behind the altar is a mullioned window opening towards the interior of the cathedral, sided by two decorative lozenges which can be seen also on the exterior walls of the apse, and are typical of the Pisane Romanesque style. The right room houses instead a characteristic mitre-shaped fireplace. From the narthex is also accessible the true interior of the church, which has a nave and two aisles divided by columns, with a semicircular apse. The nave is covered by wooden trusses, while the aisles are groin-vaulted. Light is provided by narrow single mullioned windows, six in each side plus another in the apse and two at the end of the aisles. On the southern side is a bell tower, whose upper part is missing after crumbling down in an unknown date. It has a square plan and is decorated by false columns and Lombard bands, which are also present on the church's external sides and apse.

He was one of the first scholars to work on the Egyptian Sahidic texts.Le Jardin des Livres He examined the Codex Alexandrinus and the published text of the New Testament from this codex in 1786. Woide was described in 1782 by C. P. Moritz as living \\"not far from Paddington, in a very salubrious quarter on the edge of the town, where he breathes cleaner and fresher air than in the city. Although well known as a learned authority on Oriental languages, he is nevertheless a sociable and not unworldly man.\\"Carl Philip Moritz: Journeys of a German in England in 1782, translated and edited by Reginald Nettel (New York, NY: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc., 1965), p. 60. Woide possessed some leaves of a Greek-Coptic diglot manuscript of the New Testament known as the Fragmentum Woideanum. These cover a portion of the Book of Luke. Woide suggested that the fragment was created in the 7th century.Thomas Hartwell Horne, \\"An Introduction to the Critical Study and Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures\\" The leaves belong to Uncial 070 and other leaves of this manuscript are kept in different locations. Personal life and legacy Woide studied in Frankfurt an der Oder and in Leiden, and held a doctorate of divinity from the University of Copenhagen. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1785, created D.C.L. by the University of Oxford in 1786, and appointed a fellow of many foreign societies. He and his wife had two daughters. He was struck by apoplexy while in conversation at the house of Sir Joseph Banks in 1790, and later died in his rooms at the British Museum. Woide's papers are held at the British Library. The Fragmentum Woideanum is kept at the Clarendon Press in Oxford.British History Online.

In the 1960s he gave up a successful career as a newspaper editor to start a news service that would reflect the views of people in newly independent African countries and elsewhere in the developing world. He was on first name terms with leaders such as Indira Gandhi and Kenneth Kaunda, and was known to many as ‚ÄúMr Commonwealth‚Äù.  Biography  The only child of a middle-class family, brought up in North London, Ingram was successful immediately after leaving Highgate School at the age of 16 during WW2. He was earning six guineas a week as a sub-editor on the Daily Sketch at the age of 17. He served as a signalman in the Navy, stationed until 1946 in Rome. After being demobbed, he joined the Daily Express, but in 1949 jumped ship to the Daily Mail, where he rose to deputy editor. He might have become editor, but his liberal politics and ferocious opposition to apartheid and racism in any form put him at odds with the paper's proprietor, Viscount Rothermere. Ingram resigned in 1966, but not before making his views known in Partners in Adventure, one of five books he authored. \\"Two problems above all torture our minds in this second half of the 20th century,\\" he wrote. \\"The first is the atomic threat to our civilisation; the second the relationship between the black man and the white. The greatest single factor about the Commonwealth idea is that it transcends all racial barriers.\\" For Ingram, such views were not just theory. In 1967, he founded Gemini News Service, a syndication service that provided an alternative to wire services like Reuters by providing a platform for young journalists from the developing world. Gemini writers included a young Trevor McDonald in Trinidad who would go on to gain fame as a newsreader in the UK. A package of six articles, covering everything from politics to healthcare, education and art, copied on a Gestetner machine, was sent out by mail twice a week, Ingram himself stuffing the envelopes alongside a small, overworked staff. Because of Gemini, newspaper readers in Malaysia, for example, could read articles by journalists from Kenya and vice versa. Gemini pioneered the use of graphics and explanatory maps, which later became standard in newspapers. For many young reporters it was an opportunity to be published that they could get nowhere else, and Ingram would champion young reporters, especially those who came from Commonwealth countries where journalism was in its infancy. Ingram's legacy includes the CJA/Derek Ingram Fellowship, a fund administered as part of Wolfson College's Press Fellowship Programme In Cambridge UK, to support the personal and professional development of journalists. While running Gemini, Ingram continued to report on the Commonwealth, covering 20 CHOGMs ‚Äì Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings ‚Äì stopping only when ill health intervened in his late 1980s. He was amongst the last foreign correspondents to interview the Indian Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, before his death. He never name-dropped, but other journalists envied his access to post- Independence African leaders such as Julius Nyerere and Kenneth Kaunda, who would listen to Ingram's views on Commonwealth issues, knowing that he understood the politics better than almost anyone else. He also got to know Thabo Mbeki and other politicians who would go on to govern post-apartheid South Africa. In 1978 Ingram co-founded the Commonwealth Journalists' Association, of which he remained President Emeritus after his retirement in 1990 until his death. He was a long-serving trustee on the board of the Commonwealth Institute in London. He received recognition from several Commonwealth bodies and in the 1998 Birthday Honours he was awarded an OBE in the Diplomatic List for services to Commonwealth journalism. Ingram was a member of the Round Table Moot, having first attended a meeting of the Moot in 1971. Until 2007 he wrote the \\"Commonwealth Update\\" in The Round Table Journal. He wrote extensively in the journal, including its coverage of Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings, having attended every one since 1971. He was a Vice-President of the Royal Commonwealth Society. Ingram never married, nor had children, though he relished strong friendships across generations from around the world. He loved theatre, music and art and collected anything notable that was printed or published from postage stamps to newspapers, magazines, books and theatre programmes. Cultured, he boasted nonetheless that he had never been in control of a wheel in his life. He neither drove a car nor rode a bicycle. For decades he would always walk from his house in a quiet mews in Marylebone to his office and to meetings all over central London, and at a cracking pace. Right up until the last few months of his life, he would read the newspapers every morning and watch Channel 4 News at 7pm, proud to see one his Gemini proteges, Lindsey Hilsum, reporting from around the world. \\"Eventually the peoples of the world must be colour-blind,\\" he wrote in 1965. \\"The Commonwealth is there as an instrument to this end, and all of us must try to use it.\\" While others denigrated it as a diplomatic talking shop, or an association of rogues, Ingram, like Queen Elizabeth II, believed in the Commonwealth as a force for good. He died on 17 June 2018 at the age of 92.

He claims that he should stay and that they should watch after each other. Tom starts to dislike Silas and becomes suspicious of him and his past. Tom travels to the town police station to look for records regarding Silas after he finds a newspaper clipping about his father and him in the attic. The whole town is deserted, with only flyers announcing a mandatory evacuation due to the storm. Tom is attacked by two deranged men after finding an article showing Silas as the actual killer of his father. Tom manages to fight the two men off and escape back to the farm. The news article reveals that Silas' father lost the farm because he was drunk, and this enraged Silas so much that he hung him from a tree and left him there for days. When a bank foreclosure agent came by to foreclose on the house, Silas slit his throat, as well. Silas is shown to have been in prison for the last 20 years related to the two deaths. Tom, after finding his wife in the bathroom with Silas soaking in the tub, kicks him out at gunpoint and tells him never to return. That night, Silas does return, however, and starts a fire as a distraction outside, which makes Tom run out to look for Silas. Silas wraps a rope around Tom's neck and drags him up in the tree to hang, just like he did with his father. Silas then goes into the house to talk to Tom's wife and try to persuade her to become his new wife. Tom's son comes to his rescue and cuts Tom down from the tree moments before he loses consciousness. A battle then ensues between Tom and Silas. Tom burns Silas alive by pushing him into the fire Silas created as the distraction. After the battle, Tom and his family notice that the stars in the sky start to glow and then disappear just as depicted in the Bible. Throughout the movie, Silas makes several references to the upcoming \\"end of the world\\", as well as the \\"rapture\\", as an explanation to the disappearance of the town's population and the fact that armed looters roam it. Just before the end credits role, the entire universe is shown glowing very brightly, then disappearing, signifying the world's end.Uwe Boll‚Äôs ‚ÄúStorm‚Äù Looks ‚Ä¶ Good?

A U.S. Cavalry lieutenant is assigned to deliver a peace treaty to a powerful Indian chief, but two Indians have vowed to kill the officer before he completes his mission. The film was shot in Pathecolor and filmed on location in Death Valley National Park. Plot The pre-credit sequence of the film starts out with Bureau of Indian Affairs Commissioner Kirby and the last survivor of his US Cavalry escort shot and scalped by Taslik (Keith Larsen) and his squaw Wanima (Joan Taylor). The film proper begins with Lt. Billings (Robert Stack) leading his patrol, that has escorted Cpl Hamilton (Charles Nolte), a cartographer who has been making maps of the area. On the way back to the fort they are met by a messenger, who brings orders that they are to meet Commissioner Kirby (Richard H. Cutting) and his party at a trading post in order to deliver a recently signed Indian treaty from Washington to the chief of the local tribe. The messenger gives the treaty to the Lieutenant, who commandeers him to join his patrol. The patrol, who are unaware of the fate of Kirby and his party, have nine days to get the treaty to the chief, lest a new uprising start. At the trading post is Taslik, who offers to lead the patrol to the chief. Taslik is wearing war paint that he explains is from his killing members of a rival tribe who have trespassed on his tribe's land. Unknown to the patrol, Taslik and Wanima, who is shadowing the patrol, are strongly against the peace treaty. The two sabotage the patrol's supplies at every turn in various undetected ways. On their journey the patrol discovers the remains of Commissioner Kirby's escort. The patrol finally get wise to Taslik when they discover that he has led them in a giant circle looking for water. With time rapidly vanishing, Lt. Billings collects all the remaining water of the rapidly diminishing patrol to fill one water bottle. This is given to one of the troopers, who is to make his way overland to the Indian village while the rest of the men conserve their strength by traveling only at night. Wanima ambushes the trooper and kills him but is wounded herself and becomes unconscious. At night the patrol discovers what has happened, but Billings refuses to kill Wanima. This causes discontent among the patrol, who have lost other members through poisoned water and suicide. Wanima agrees to lead the patrol to water but leads them to an abandoned gold mine, creating further discontent. After a brief struggle between the troopers, Wanima, and Billings, Wanima resents leading them to water. With renewed strength and the knowledge of the gold, some remaining troopers plot to collect the gold and flee. When discovered a shootout occurs, ultimately only Billings and Wanima survive, finally arriving at the village to deliver the treaty.

It was founded in 1934 after the discovery of gold in the area. The Mount Palmer Gold Mine operated from 1934 to 1944, when it closed due to labour shortages cause by World War II. The town's existence was entirely dependent on the mine such that when the mine closed, the town was abandoned soon after. The first 43 town blocks were auctioned in the Southern Cross courthouse raising ¬£3969, with a further 24 block auction after surveyors had reserved areas for public amenities. At its peak, the population of Mt Palmer was estimated to have exceeded 500. The town had three hotels, two-up rings, a bakery, butcher and two boarding houses. Townsite The Mount Palmer townsite was surveyed and gazetted in 1935 after gold was discovered in the area by Augustus Palmer, W Coulhoun and A Pollard. A number of names were suggested for the townsite including Palmer, Palmerdale, Palmerston but these were rejected due to similarities with other places. The surveyor general then proposed that the town be called Mount Palmer. The townsite is 415 km east of Perth and 46 km from Southern Cross. Mining Mining commenced in the area during 1934. Initially mines were alluvial while syndicates were formed to establish deep shaft mines. Many of the miners came from the area leaving farms established in the 1920s under the Miners Phthisis act which granted farming land to gold miners who had been exposed to mining dust. These men lived in rough humpies and tents near the mines, amid going concerns of a typhoid outbreak led the government to survey the townsite. During 1935 Claude de Bernales commenced the construction of a 20 head battery. By 1937 85,000 tons of ore had been crushed with ¬£470,000 worth of gold extracted. Employing just 130 men the operation returned ¬£200,000 to investors in the first two years. By the end of 1942 most of the men had left the mine to join the army with the work force declining to 60. In June 1944 the mine closed at which stage the main shaft had reached 500 feet. The mine recorded a total production during its operation of 4928 kg of gold from 310,728 tons brought to the surface, although speculation about the actual amount of gold produced indicates that the figure was likely significantly higher.

Santa Maria del Regno is a Romanesque church in Ardara, province of Sassari, Sardinia, Italy. History The church, together with the annexed castle of which ruins remain today, was built in the 11th century by Giorgia, daughter of the Giudice of Torres, as a Palace Chapel. The church is mentioned in the Libellus Judicum Turritanorum of the 13th century. Overview Retable The church was built in dark basalt stone by Pisan workers (the island in the Middle Ages was under strong influence from the maritime Republic of Pisa). The fa√ßade is divided into five sectors and has a salient-shaped fa√ßade. In the middle is the portal, surmounted by a double mullioned window. The whole exterior of the edifice is characterized by false columns (lesenes) and Lombard bands; on the right are the remains of the square bell tower, which is missing the upper part. The interior, on a rectangular plan, has a nave and two aisles divided by columns whose capitals have flower motifs. The nave has a wooden trusses ceiling, while the aisles are groin vaulted. In the semi- circular apse is the large retablo, the largest 16th-century polyptych in Sardinia,URL visited on January 24, 2009 located behind the high altar. The table portrays several prophets and saints, as well as episodes in the life of the Virgin Mary.

Resolution and resolving power  There are two different definitions of resolution and resolving power in mass spectrometry. = IUPAC definition = The IUPAC definition for resolution in mass spectrometry is :R = cfrac{M}{Delta M} = mathrm{resolution} :Delta M = mathrm{resolving power} :M = mathrm{mass of the (second) peak} Where a larger resolution indicates a better separation of peaks. This definition is used in a number of mass spectrometry texts. This use is also implied by the term \\"high-resolution mass spectrometry.\\" A high value for resolution corresponding to good separation of peaks is similar to the convention used with chromatography separations, although it is important to note that the definitions are not the same. High resolution indicating better peak separation is also used in ion mobility spectrometry. =Resolving power definition= Some mass spectrometrists use the definition that is similar to definitions used in some other fields of physics and chemistry. In this case, resolving power is defined as: :R = cfrac{M}{Delta M} = mathrm{resolving power} The minimum peak separation ŒîM which allows to distinguish two ion species is then called: :Delta M = mathrm{resolution} Resolution and resolving power, when defined in this way, are consistent with IUPAC recommendations for microscopy, optical spectroscopy. and ion microscopy (SIMS) but not gas chromatography. This definition also appears in some mass spectrometry texts. Measuring peak separation There are several ways to define the minimum peak separation ŒîM in mass spectrometry, therefore it is important to report the method used to determine mass resolution when reporting its value. The two most widely used are the peak width definition and the valley definition. =Peak width definition= In the peak width definition, the value of ŒîM is the width of the peak measured at a specified fraction of the peak height, for example 0.5%, 5%, 10% or 50%.

He was born in Frankfurt to a Jewish father and a Lutheran mother; by the time he finished his school examinations in 1938 life for Jews and people associated with Jews was becoming difficult. With the support of friends and relatives in Britain, the family were able to move to London, where he arrived in 1938 \\"with a small suitcase and a large cello\\". Education Wanting to pursue a scientific career, Spear attended evening classes for the University of London entrance examination, which he passed before the family were interned on the Isle of Man as suspected Axis sympathisers. They were soon released, and Spear joined the Royal Pioneer Corps in 1940, later moving to the Royal Artillery where he became a Bombardier before being demobilized in 1946. After returning to London he took an External London Physics Degree at Regent Street Polytechnic. Following graduation he began work on a PhD at Birkbeck College London in the Crystallography Research Department under Werner Ehrenberg; due to lack of financial support they had to cobble together their own equipment or use captured German apparatus. Career Spear graduated in 1950, but obtained a Research Fellowship that allowed him to stay there to do additional work. He left Birkbeck in 1953 to take up a position at University College, Leicester, where he did research on amorphous selenium films. One of his PhD students at Leicester was Alf Adams, the British physicist who invented the strained-layer quantum-well laser. Walter Spear left Leicester in 1968 after being offered the Harris Chair of Physics at the University of Dundee. It was while working at Leicester that Spear first came into contact with a student named Peter LeComber with whom he would work closely throughout his career. LeComber came with Spear to Dundee, and together they would become famed for their joint research into the properties of amorphous silicon. The work carried out by Spear and LeComber and their research team in this field drew great interest and led to the creation of the amorphous film silicon transistor. It was this innovation that directly led to LCD technology and to the eventual development of technologies such as flat screen TVs and solar panels. While at Dundee they also established the Amorphous Materials Research Group which was devoted to the study of non-crystalline solids. When Walter Spear retired in 1988 he was succeeded in the Harris Chair by Peter LeComber. However LeComber died suddenly in 1992. LeComber's death effectively marked the end of Spear's active research career. Awards and honours In 1972 Spear was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, in 1976 he was awarded the Europhysics Prize of the European Physical Society and in 1977 the Max Born Medal by the Institute of Physics. In 1980 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London and awarded the Makdougall Brisbane Prize of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/obits_alpha/spear_w.pdf In 1988 he was awarded the Rank Prize, and the same year presented the Royal Society Bakerian Lecture. In 1990 he was awarded their Rumford Medal, and he retired soon afterwards. His nomination for the Royal Society reads Walter Spear's archives are held by Archive Services, University of Dundee. As well as including academic works by Spear and notes for talks and lectures, they include Spear's ‚ÄòScientific Curiosities and Absurdities‚Äô file which features some of the more unusual correspondence Spear received.  Personal  His mother, born Eva Reineck, was the daughter of a Lutheran pastor: she became well-known in Frankfurt and a professional violinist and teacher. He himself inherited a seventeenth century Italian ‚Äòcello while still a boy. He had received 'cello lessons from the age of 8, and was a talented amateur cellist throughout his adult life. His father, David Spear, was a graphic artist who later became a pioneering photographer. Walter Spear was survived by his widow, born Hilda D. King, whom he had married in Middlesex in 1952, by the couple's two daughters and by their grandchildren.

In 1903 William Harrison Anderson,W. H. Aderson's biography a Christian missionary of the Seventh-day Adventist denomination, crossed the Zambezi River from Solusi Mission in Zimbabwe to set up the Rusangu Mission in Zambia in 1905. Includes picture of Anderson and Stockil travelling by ox wagon King Lewanika of the Barotse people had invited Anderson to come into his territory and establish the mission. Anderson walked 900 miles before deciding on a location. He described how he chose the site: Anderson and his wife arrived on the farm the fifth of September 1905. He built their home, planted a garden, developed a farm, built a school-house, taught the school, and acted as doctor and nurse to the people who came to the station for help. From this mission station, grew the Rusangu Primary School, the Rusangu Secondary School and eventually in 1975 the Rusangu Ministerial School. In 1993, the Rusangu Ministerial School changed its name to Zambia Adventist Seminary. A year later in 1994, the Seminary was closed to pave way for re-organization. In 1997, plans to re-open the Seminary brought the idea of the Zambia Adventist College that would offer other courses in addition to theology and pastoral training. In 2000, an in-service program for serving church pastors began at Riverside Farm Institute in collaboration with Solusi University. With the full development of the Zambia Adventist College idea, this pastors‚Äô program finally moved back to the historic Rusangu Mission site in May 2003.

The insured can spend the benefit payment however they choose. Accident insurance is complementary to, not a replacement for, health insurance.  Accidents  While accidents and their causes vary wildly, the general definition of an accident is an unfortunate incident that happens unexpectedly and unintentionally, typically resulting in damage or injury. Accident insurers may define accidents differently in their specific policies.  Common exclusions  Every insurer maintains a list of events and circumstances that void the insured's entitlement to his or her accident benefits. For example, accident insurance policies may exclude coverage for injuries sustained while the insured was intoxicated or committing an illegal act.  Comparison to other types of insurance  Accident insurance is part of a category of insurance products designed to manage the cost of medical care. Other types of insurance in this category include health insurance, disability insurance, and accidental death & dismemberment insurance. Accident insurance is part of a category distinct from liability insurance or property insurance. = Health insurance = Accident insurance complements but does not replace health insurance. In the event of an accident resulting in an injury, a health insurance policyholder may still be responsible for out-of-pocket expenses. These may include copayments, deductibles, and coinsurance charges that must be paid by the insured before the health insurer pays any benefits. In the first half of 2018, almost half of Americans with health insurance had high- deductible plans--defined as plans with a deductible of at least $1,350 for an individual policyholder. Without accident insurance, the insured would be responsible for paying that full amount (plus a copayment and any out-of- network costs) themselves before a health insurer began paying for care. = Disability insurance = Like accident insurance, disability insurance pays the insured directly if they are injured in a way covered by the policy. However, disability insurance only pays if the injury prevents the insured from working. Accident insurance benefits are paid whether or not the insured misses work as a result of the accident. = Accidental death & dismemberment insurance = In the event of an accidental death, accidental death and dismemberment insurance, often abbreviated as \\"AD&D;\\", will pay benefits in addition to any life insurance held by the insured. Accidental deaths are the third leading cause of death in the U.S. Some accident insurance policies will include benefits for accidental death and dismemberment.  Policy structures = Individual policies = Individual plans are designed to cover a single person or family that is not purchasing accident insurance through an organization. = Group policies = Group accident insurance plans are those that are created to be sold through an employer or other incorporated organization. They are typically designed and priced for the group as a whole. = On-demand accident insurance = With on-demand accident insurance, the policyholder receives coverage the same day they apply for it. In addition, on-demand insurance providers may offer episodic insurance policies, which allow the policyholder to customize the term of the policy (i.e. the duration of coverage). The policyholder need only pay for coverage for as long as they need or can afford it. Prices generally correspond to the length of the term, with lower prices for shorter terms.

The Latin name 'Ramas' means branch. This genus is a shrubby or fruticose group with erect or pendulous thalli. The branches are flattened and rather stiff. Colour varies from pale green though yellow-grey to white-grey. Apothecia are frequent and soralia may be present. Apothecia are usually concave and often pruinose. R. fraxinea branches have a very distinctive shape, being widest toward the middle (as much as 4.5 cm in some specimens) and tapering at both the point of attachment and toward the tip (to about 1 cm). The thallus is green-grey in colour, pendent and may be as long as 10 cm. It has the overall appearance of being coarsely tufted, individual branches showing a channelled, wrinkled appearance. The branches may have a twist or turn to them. The apothecia are cup-like and convex and are found both along the edges of the branches and on the surface or lamina.Lichens of Ireland Project The Ramalinas are also known as 'Bush', 'Strap', or 'Gristle' lichens. They always grow upside-down, and this plant looks like seaweed nailed to a tree.Hymenophyllaceae It has a scientific symbol of 'RAFR' and an ITIS (Integrated Taxonomic Information System)ITIS serial of 190870.  Life cycle  The spores are kidney-shaped. It does not contain as many apothecia as Ramalina fastigiata. The specimens in the photographs here shown here are very large, but does not have many apothecia, the spore-producing discs. The few that were present were borne on short stalks, and were located on the surface of the lobes, especially near the edges.  Sensitivity to air pollution  Ramalina fraxinae is very sensitive to air pollution (SO2). It likes windy, exposed and well-lit sites and is found mainly on trees. It was found in Edinburgh in 2008 after an absence since 1797 due to air pollution.  Uses  Ramalina species were at one time dried and ground down to produce a white hair powder and also used as a cure for chilblains.Dobson, Frank S. The Jarrold Nature Series Common British Lichens. Norwich : Jarrold Colour Publications. Number 24. It was also used in making perfumes and in Sweden, northern Europe and northern Russia, R. fraxinea has been used to make brandy.

The IRE service was first introduced in the 2001 summer timetable, due to the increasing abolition of Interregio routes by DB's long-distance division (DB Fernverkehr). As a result, several German states ordered InterRegioExpress trains on the routes affected. In addition IRE trains were also introduced on routes that had not previously had an Interregio service (e. g. on the Stuttgart‚ÄìT√ºbingen‚ÄìAulendorf and Ulm‚ÄìAalen routes). Unlike the former Interregio trains, IRE trains were classified as local passenger trains and can therefore be used by passengers with local tickets (DB Fares product group C as well as tickets issued by Passenger Transport Executives). This led however to passengers being irritated, especially to begin with, because they frequently did not realise that they could use these trains with local tickets. Furthermore, the new train type was often wrongly referred to in the early days as an InterRegionalExpress or ironically as an InterRegioErsatz (InterRegio substitute). However, since then the name Interregio-Express has established itself.

The designation IRE has since been used for the Franconia-Saxony Express from Nuremberg to Dresden, which replaced the previous Intercitys. In contrast to all the other IRE routes, the Franconia- Saxony Express is not subsidised by the SPNV (local public transport) organisations, but by an internal arm of DB Fernverkehr. * IRE Wertheim‚ÄìMiltenberg‚ÄìAschaffenburg‚ÄìHanau (Main Valley Railway) Saxony-Anhalt and Berlin: * IRE 25 Magdeburg-Berlin-Express: Magdeburg ‚Äì Berlin S√ºdkreuz ‚Äì Berlin Potsdamer Platz ‚Äì Berlin Hauptbahnhof (‚Äì Berlin Gesundbrunnen station) (two train-pairs Monday-Friday)  Temporary routes  In the meantime IRE trains with former IR coaches ran on the Saarbr√ºcken‚ÄìKaiserslautern‚ÄìLudwigshafen‚ÄìMannheim route for a year, a route now worked by the more usual Regional-Express services. In Hesse in 2001 differences arose between the DB AG, which designated inter alia the Frankfurt‚ÄìGie√üen‚ÄìKassel and Frankfurt‚ÄìGie√üen‚ÄìSiegen as InterRegioExpress routes, and the RMV, which steadfastly refused to adopt this new train category and even today uses the defunct StadtExpress term. In addition, in several federal states, on the introduction of the InterRegioExpress, former RE routes were changed to IRE routes. Whilst the difference between IRE and RE is hardly discernible, RE and RB trains can clearly be told apart just by the frequency of stops. The renaming of RE to IRE has been reversed in all cases.  Usual running and rolling stock  IRE services in Baden-W√ºrttemberg use a great variety of stock, including diesel-driven tilting trains of classes 611 and 612, double-decker coaches of various generations and locomotive-hauled trains with n coaches. In earlier years y coaches could also be seen (on the Stuttgart‚ÄìT√ºbingen line) as IRE trains as well as DBAG Class 650 multiples (Regio-Shuttle, in this case without 1st class service). Moreover, until spring 2006 old Class 112-hauled Interregio coaches in classic blue livery were also used on the Karlsruhe‚ÄìPforzheim-Stuttgart line as IRE trains. The delivery of newer double-decker coaches and Class 146 locomotives however means that that type of train formation belongs to history. Class 612 diesel- powered tilting trains are used on the Franconia-Saxony Express.

The Lost City of Z: A Tale of Deadly Obsession in the Amazon is the debut non-fiction book by American author David Grann. The book was published in 2009 and recounts the activities of the British explorer Percy Fawcett who, in 1925, disappeared with his son in the Amazon while looking for an ancient lost city. For decades explorers and scientists have tried to find evidence of his party and of the \\"Lost City of Z\\". Grann also recounts his own journey into the Amazon, by which he discovered new evidence about how Fawcett may have died. He learned that Fawcett may have come upon \\"Z\\" without knowing it.David Grann, Lost City of Z, 2009, pp. 270‚Äì72 The book claims as many as 100 people may have died or disappeared (and are presumed dead) searching for Fawcett over the years; however, the more historically accurate toll, according to John Hemming, is one. The Lost City of Z was the basis of a 2016 feature film of the same name, written and directed by James Gray. Kuhikugu First in his 2005 article \\"The Lost City of Z\\" and later in the book he developed and published with the same title, David Grann reported on excavations by the archeologist Michael Heckenberger at a site in the Amazon Xingu region that might be the long-rumored lost city. The ruins were surrounded by several concentric circular moats, with evidence of palisades that had been described in the folklore and oral history of nearby tribes. Heckenberger also found evidence of wooden structures and roads that cut through the jungle. Black Indian earth showed evidence that humans had added supplements to the soil to increase its fertility to support agriculture. Perhaps most intriguing were the direct parallels between the site, referred to as Kuhikugu, and tribes of the area. Pottery methods had remained nearly identical and the tribes followed a diet that prohibited several sources of food‚Äîstriking considering the long-held belief that such prohibitions would mean death in the harsh rainforest. Contemporary villages are laid out in patterns similar to those seen at three sites of the ancient cities. Kuhikugu encompasses more than 20 settlements, each supporting as many as 5,000 people. Construction methods showed sophisticated engineering. The structures were made of wood, supporting a society that flourished from approximately 200 A.D. until around 1600, according to carbon-dating data obtained from the moats and pottery. Their constructions included bridges across some of the great rivers of the Amazon. Their monuments extended horizontally, rather than being built as the pyramidal structures developed by the Mayan or Aztec peoples. The settlements and civilization of these people appeared to have lasted long enough for them to have had contact with Europeans. Many died due to new infectious diseases, which may have been carried by some of their usual indigenous trading partners, rather than directly by Europeans. The high rate of fatality of these epidemics disrupted the people and their society: in only a few years, they were so devastated by disease that they had virtually died out. The earliest conquistadors left records of their glimpses of this civilization, but by the time they tried to explore the rainforest again, the indigenous people were all but gone. The jungle was quickly reclaiming the land.Biello, David. (August 28, 2008). \\"Ancient Amazon Actually Highly Urbanized\\", Scientific American. Reception The Lost City of Z was reviewed by Rich Cohen in the Sunday New York Times Book Review, who said it was \\"a powerful narrative, stiff lipped and Victorian at the center, trippy at the edges, as if one of those stern men of Conrad had found himself trapped in a novel by Garc√≠a M√°rquez.\\"Cohen, Rich.

In her review, Kakutani wrote that it \\"is at once a biography, a detective story and a wonderfully vivid piece of travel writing that combines Bruce Chatwinesque powers of observation with a Waugh-like sense of the absurd. Mr. Grann treats us to a harrowing reconstruction of Fawcett‚Äôs forays into the Amazonian jungle, as well as an evocative rendering of the vanished age of exploration. . . . Suspenseful. . . Rollicking . . . Fascinating . . . It reads with all the pace and excitement of a movie thriller and all the verisimilitude and detail of firsthand reportage.‚ÄùKakutani, Michiko.

(March 6, 2009). \\"Lost in the Jungle.\\" Washington Post. The book appeared on several \\"best\\" and \\"notable books of the year\\" lists, including that of Entertainment Weekly, Washington Post, Boston Globe, Publisher's Weekly, Sunday New York Times, Christian Science Monitor, Bloomberg, the Providence Journal, The Globe and Mail, Evening Standard, Amazon, and McClatchy Newspapers. Barnes & Noble ranked The Lost City of Z as the single best nonfiction book of 2009. At the same time, critics have pointed out inaccuracies and distortions by Grann. Writing for The Wall Street Journal, Simon Winchester said the book was \\"captivating\\" but faulted Grann's credulity, especially when he imagined that he was seeing the ruins of \\"Z\\". Winchester writes, \\"Oh, please. It is all just too pat, too wanting in healthy skepticism.\\"Winchester, Simon. (February 27, 2009). \\"The Endless Allure of El Dorado.\\" Wall Street Journal. Hugh Thomson writes in The Washington Post that Grann's book is \\"a source of distortion, as it ignores or inflates much available material on Fawcett.\\"Thomson, Hugh. \\"The hero of ‚ÄòThe Lost City of Z‚Äô was no hero\\", Washington Post, April 12, 2009. John Hemming dismissed much of the book as hyperbolic in his review for The Times Literary Supplement, concluding, \\"It is a pity that a writer as good as Grann chose to study this unimportant, disagreeable and ultimately pathetic man. It is an even greater pity that he decided to inflate and distort so much of this sad story.\\" Hemming assails Grann for dabbling in the \\"green-hell\\" genre, where the jungle is depicted as offering some new lethal threat with each footstep. The review notes Grann's exaggerations of Fawcett's exploits. Hemming said that Grann's claim that Fawcett \\"helped redraw the map of South America\\" was a \\"staggering exaggeration\\", given the insignificance of his actual expeditions. He describes Grann as \\"totally wrong\\" about both Fawcett's beliefs about El Dorado and the current state of scholarship on the subject. Hemming said that \\"there is no excuse for [Grann's] fantasies\\" about the dangers of indigenous tribes and the depth of Fawcett's contact with them.Hemming, John. \\"Gung ho ho.

She was the mother of Amarinder Singh, the current Chief Minister of Punjab. Had it not been for the erstwhile Indian princely families being stripped of their titles in 1971, upon the death of her husband she would have been considered Rajmata (queen mother), and in popular usage is commonly referred to as such. Early years She was born in Ludhiana, undivided Punjab as Mohinder Kaur Shergill, the daughter of Sardar Harchand Singh Jaijee (Shergill), a nobleman of Patiala State and a member of the Patiala Riyasat Prajya Mandal (Patiala State Peoples' Forum, an affiliate of the Indian National Congress party). In August 1938, at age 16, she was married to the Maharaja of Patiala Yadavindra Singh, the ruling Maharaja of Patiala. She was the Maharaja's second wife. As the senior Maharani was also named Mohinder Kaur, and was present in the palace to receive her co-wife, the younger Mohinder Kaur received the new name Mehtab Kaur. As Maharani Residence of Maharani Mehtab Kaur, New Moti Bagh Palace, Patiala. Yadvinder Singh had succeeded his father as the Maharaja of Patiala, only a few months prior to his wedding. His first marriage had been (and remained) childless. However, barely 10 months after her wedding, Mehtab Kaur became a mother with the birth of a daughter, Heminder Kaur, future wife of the diplomat and politician Natwar Singh. The following year saw the birth of another daughter, Rupinder Kaur, followed in March 1942 by her first son Amarinder Singh. He was followed in 1944 by a second son, Malvinder Singh. India gained its independence in 1947. On 15 July 1948, the princely state of Patiala was merged with the Indian union and the ruling power of the Maharaja was ended. Patiala was merged with certain other princely states to form PEPSU (Patiala and East Punjab States' Union), a state within the union of India. Yadvinder Singh was named Rajpramukh or ceremonial Governor of this new state. The royal family of Patiala worked diligently to adjust to the new realities of their situation, and Maharani Mehtab Kaur (the name by which she was now known) made important contributions in the transition. India received its independence at the price of being partitioned, and the province of Punjab bore the brunt of that brutal upheaval. Patiala, as a major town located near the newly defined border between India and Pakistan, received tens of thousands of Hindu and Sikh refugees who had been compelled to leave their homes in the territories that became Pakistan. The royal family of Patiala organised numerous camps and relief projects in aid of these refugees. In particular, the two Maharanis supervised relief kitchens and medical provisions for them. Political career At the time when his state was merged into the Patiala and East Punjab States Union, the Maharaja had been given the position of Rajpramukh (ceremonial governor) of PEPSU for life. However, in 1956, PEPSU disappeared from the map following a further reorganization of internal borders in India, and the Maharaja was summarily deprived of the responsibilities (and perks) of office. After 1956, the Maharaja was given various diplomatic assignments, including heading Indian delegations to the UN general assembly (1956), UNESCO (1957‚Äì58) and UNFAO (1959 onwards). He also served as ambassador to Italy (1965‚Äì66) and the Netherlands (1971‚Äì1974). These relatively minor assignments were a far cry from the assurances that the royals of India had received when they signed away their kingdoms, and from the absolute ruling powers to which the Maharaja had been accustomed. Further, the ruling Congress party was championing a sharp turn left-wards in its policies, and its utterances with regard to the erstwhile princes were radical and alarming. Since Patiala was by far the largest of the princely states in Punjab, the government had deemed it expedient to keep the Maharaja beholden (and away from politics) by giving him minor diplomatic assignments which required his presence abroad. The Maharaja was however anxious to gain some political leverage and influence in the ruling dispensation, but as a titular Maharaja, it was not possible for him to enter party politics himself. Meanwhile, Mehtab Kaur's father and family had risen in the ranks of the Congress party, building on the Riyasat Praja Mandal background. For these reasons, and at her husband's behest, Mehtab Kaur entered party politics in 1964. Mehtab Kaur served as a member of Rajya Sabha, the indirectly elected upper house of the Indian Parliament, from 1964 to 1967 as a Congress party member. In 1967, she was elected to the 4th Lok Sabha (1967‚Äì71),Tribune of India It‚Äôs development vs Panth in Patiala the directly elected lower house of Parliament, from the Patiala constituency. In 1971, the Congress party and its government executed some of their radical plans by individually 'de-recognizing' each and every one of the over 500 Maharajas who existed at that time in India. The privy purse (pension) and other benefits which had been guaranteed to them by solemn covenant in 1947-48, when they signed away their kingdoms, were summarily withdrawn as well. In keeping with Indira Gandhi's anti-royal political stance, Mehtab Kaur was marginalized and was not given a party nomination to contest the general elections of 1971. Instead, the Maharaja was appointed ambassador to the Netherlands that year, and the family again moved abroad. Later life In 1974, the former Maharaja died at the Hague while still serving as India's ambassador to the Netherlands. The family returned to India, and the two dowager ex-Maharanis took up residence in their family home, the Moti Bagh Palace in Patiala. Due to the demise of her husband, Mehtab Kaur gave up wearing jewelry, silk or bright colored clothing, and dressed exclusive in two colors, namely white and Indigo blue, which are the colors of renunciation and piety in Sikh tradition. She had forayed into politics only because her husband had desired it, and as a pious widow, she now intended to withdraw from public life and spend her days in prayer and religious observances. All her children were married and settled by this time, and she had seven grandchildren upon whom she doted. However, in 1977, outraged by the excesses of the Emergency, in particular the forced sterilization by vasectomy of healthy men, she joined the Janata Party and was named one of its general secretaries. That party won the general elections held shortly thereafter, and in 1978, Mehtab Kaur was made a member of the Rajya Sabha. She served a full 6-year term (1978‚Äì84) in the upper house and then withdrew from public life. In her retirement, Mehtab Kaur maintained the charitable traditions of her family and remained assiduous in matters of tradition and religious observance. She often granted audience to ladies from Patiala State until advanced age and ill-health prevented exertion. Her piety, austerity and charity made her a cultural icon in Patiala. In later life, she resided in New Moti Bagh Palace, Patiala, before her death on 24 July 2017.

It lies within the Brecon Beacons National Park and Fforest Fawr Geopark. Its summit at OS grid ref SN 874161 reaches a height of 538m / 1763 ft above sea level. The hill is within the Ogof Ffynnon Ddu National Nature Reserve which is owned and managed by the Countryside Council for Wales.Ordnance Survey Explorer map OL12 'Brecon Beacons National Park: western area' Geology The southern slopes of the hill are formed from the Twrch Sandstone, a coarse quartzitic sandstone (gritstone), formerly known as the Basal Grit of the Millstone Grit Series, and laid down during the Namurian stage of the Carboniferous period. The northern slopes are formed from the underlying Carboniferous Limestone. The area displays various features typical of karstic landscapes including hundreds of shakeholes in both the limestone and the gritstone areas. Substantial areas of gritstone country have foundered as the underlying limestone has dissolved away and caverns have collapsed. There are also areas of both limestone pavement and gritstone pavement. The latter occasionally retain striations on their polished upper surfaces due to scratching by stones embedded in the base of a moving icesheet during the last ice age some 18,000 years ago. There are also pockets of silica sand where the gritstone has been intensively weathered. An economically valuable deposit of silica sand was worked near Pwll Byfre for many years and transported by tramroad to make refractory bricks ('firebricks' or 'silica bricks') at the nearby Penwyllt Dinas Silica Brick Works.

At an early age, his family moved to Lanesboro, Co. Longford, where his blacksmith father found work with Bord na Mona. Harte draws on the experience of this uprooting in his novel In the Wake of the Bagger. Later he moved to Dublin where he worked at many jobs, including the civil service and teaching; from 1983-2000, he was principal of Lucan Community College.  Short stories  Harte has published several critically acclaimed collections of short stories. His first, Murphy in the Underworld (1986), was welcomed by the Sunday Independent as \\"one of the most important story collections for some time.\\"Sunday Independent, 29 June 1986 After publication of his second collection, Birds and Other Tails (1996), the Irish Independent described Harte as \\"a wonderful refreshing voice in contemporary Irish writing.\\"Irish Independent, 5 October 1996 Both these collections are out of print, although several of their stories are included in From Under Gogol's Nose (2004). Several short stories and collections have been published in translation. These include Birds and Selected Stories, published in Bulgarian in 2001, Dream of A Pyramid, published in Hindi in 2006, and From Under Gogol's Nose, published in Russian by Voskresenye Publishing House, Moscow, in 2007.  Novels  Harte's first novel, In the Wake of the Bagger, was published in 2006. It was commissioned by Sligo Co Council under the Irish Government's Per Cent for Art scheme. It tells the story of the Dowd family, who are uprooted from their home in Killeenduff and resettle as economic migrants in the Irish Midlands. It describes the tension between the traditional Irish way of life and the new realities of industrialisation in rural Ireland. The novel was described in the Irish Independent as \\"one of the great books about Ireland.\\"Irish Independent, 1 July 2006 It was selected by Des Kenny as one of his 101 Irish Books You MUST Read ‚Äì Kenny's Choice.101 Irish Books You MUST Read ‚Äì Kenny's Choice, Currach Press, Dublin, 2008 Harte's second novel is Reflections in a Tar-Barrel. It weaves the story of Tommy Loftus who sells religious goods in Ireland's west. Unravelling the Spiral is an account of the life of Harte's cousin, sculptor Fred Conlon. Harte and Conlon were born within ten months of each other in the townland of Killeenduff, grew up together, and were close friends until Conlon's death.  Arts organiser  Harte was an organiser for the arts in Ireland throughout the 1970s and 1980s. In 1986, Harte founded the Irish Writers' Union. The following year he secured funding from the Irish government to establish the Irish Writers Centre.Fighting for Writers' Rights, Irish Times, 26 May 1992 In December 2008, the Arts Council of Ireland withdrew the Centre's funding because of concerns about \\"value for money and quality of service to writers\\". In 2009, the Centre was on the point of closing. Harte was elected chairman and, with the help of other activists, kept the Centre open.

Once longer, due to various construction it now remains between Flaget Avenue and Broadway, directly across from the Bardstown Civil War Museum. Because it was always considered part of the city's street system, the Cobblestone Path is owned by the City of Bardstown, even though it now serves only pedestrian traffic.Hall p.7-1 The Cobblestone Path was built in 1785. The path was built by the citizens of Bardstown. Non-minister men between the ages of 16 and 50 were forced by law to help build it and the other roads, or be forced to pay a fine of $1.25 a day when they were assigned to work, but didn't.Hibbs p.11 It served as the main entryway to the town of Bardstown from 1785 to 1825, including the Wilderness Road. It was due to this importance that both the Kentucky legislature and the United States Congress paid for its improvements prior to 1800.Hall p.8‚Äì1 It was briefly part of the Louisville and Nashville Turnpike as well. With the building of the turnpikes to Bloomfield, Kentucky and Springfield, Kentucky, the pathway was reduced to walkers and equestrians.Hall p.8-4 The Cobblestone Path lies on top of a bluff created by Stewart's Creek Towne Branch's deep canyon, the other side of which rests My Old Kentucky Home State Park. The remaining path is long and varies in width from twenty-eight feet to twelve feet. The dolomite limestone used to cobble the pathway are not uniformly shaped, and range from six to ten inches (254 mm) thick. Natural outcroppings of limestone and even a limestone boulder lie beside the path, some of which may serve as a bench. The top portion of the path was long a popular picnic spot from the 1870s to 1900, and gained the name Lovers Leap. Less than thirty feet below the Leap is a small dry cave almost impossible to gain access to.Hall p.7-2 Erosion has always been a threat to the path, with few cobblestones remaining at the bottom of the path. During the 1920s and 1930s, Mrs. Ernest Fulton planted many flowers along the path, and did her best to fight the erosion. As a result, the path has bush honeysuckle, evergreens, jonquils, and a spruce tree. With this and the natural undergrowth, vines, and native hardwoods, the path is essentially a tunnel.Hall p.7-4 On November 16, 1989 the Cobblestone Path was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, due to its importance in the history of transportation to Kentucky.

It was based on My Friend Charles (1956), a TV serial written by Francis Durbridge. Plot Doctor Howard Latimer answers what he believes to be a request for a favour from an American friend by picking up a famous German actress from London Airport. He goes in the company of a journalist Geoffrey Windsor who tags along after failing to gain an interview with Latimer about recent medical research. As Latimer is already late for a date with his fianc√©e at the Royal Festival Hall, he lets Windsor take the actress to Claridges Hotel. When her body is later discovered in Latimer's flat, with absolutely no trace of Windsor, he is faced with questions from the police. DI Dane is initially sympathetic but as the evidence mounts up it increasingly seems as if only Latimer could have committed the murder. Latimer has the added problem of Mrs Ambler, a patient referred to him by his colleague Doctor Kimber, who keeps changing her suspicious story. With the evidence looking as though he will be charged, he goes to stay at his friend Kenneth Palmer's house where he hopes to avoid the police. While there he encounters the mysterious \\"Robert Brady\\" who shows a strange interest in a matchbook given to Latimer by the German actress. When Mrs Ambler's dead body is found suspicion again points towards Latimer. However DI Dane appears to believe in his innocence. When Latimer is approached by Windsor demanding ¬£4,000 in blackmail - not from Latimer but from Doctor Kimber - the police reveal that they know more about the case than they had been letting on. Latimer is introduced to the man he believed to be Brady who is in fact Major Harrington who works in Intelligence. Harrington reveals that the case revolves around a passport- forging ring led by an Englishman at its head. Latimer then works with the police to help unmask the criminal amongst his acquaintances.

It is a part of the Seventh- day Adventist education system, the world's second largest Christian school system. Location The university is on land that measures , in Kalagala sub-county, Bamunanika county, Luweero District in the Central Region of Uganda. The main campus is approximately , by road, northeast of Kampala, Uganda's capital and largest city. It is approximately , by road, south of the town of Ziroobwe, on the Gayaza‚ÄìZiroobwe Road. The coordinates of Bugema University campus are 0¬∞34'10.48\\"N, 32¬∞38'30.55\\"E (Latitude: 0.57; Longitude: 32.6418). History The institution started in 1948 as a training school for teachers and pastors for the Seventh-day Adventist Church in East Africa. At that time it was called Bugema Missionary Training School. Later, the name changed to Bugema Missionary College and then to Bugema Adventist College. In 1976 Bugema Adventist College received authorization from the Uganda Ministry of Education and the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists to offer a BTh degree. The college had applied to offer a BA in Theology, but the Ministry of Education denied the application because at that time only Makerere University was permitted to offer academic degrees. There were about 35 students in the program. The professors were Pastor and Mrs. Villagomez, and Pastor Gary Fordham. After President Idi Amin banned the Seventh-day Adventist church in 1977, the program was temporarily moved to Nairobi where the first degree students graduated with a BTh degree in 1978. The campus was then relocated to the church's youth camp (at Watamu just north of Mombasa) until Amin fled Uganda. While the college was at Watamu, Reuben Mugerwa finished his graduate degree at Andrews University and joined the faculty. The college was then moved back to the Bugema campus. The college expanded. By the late 1980s curricula for Business and Education were added. In 1994, Bugema Adventist College changed its status from \\"college\\" to \\"university\\". In 1997, Bugema University was granted a tertiary institution license from the Ministry of Education and Sports.

The low-budget productions were recorded in New York at Sanders Recording Studios, and released on 12\\" LP records with low press runs. Fountain's main co-star was a Brooklyn-based actor named Sandor Weisberger, who also usually served as announcer for the productions. A small entourage of local actors occasionally played lead or walk-on roles. Fountain and Weisberger were reunited in 1995 by radio station WFMU.

Themes Based on the \\"theater of the mind\\" concept of pre-television era radio drama, Fountain's productions attempted to recapture the atmosphere of broadcast favorites of yesteryear such as The Shadow, Inner Sanctum, and Lights Out. Fountain's simple, derivative plotlines often employ Halloween kitsch‚Äîspooks, witches, haunted houses‚Äîas vehicles in morality plays about redemption for the honorable and damnation for evildoers. He also appropriates elements of crime drama, featuring detectives, thieves, gunplay, and innocent victims. Characters who embody virtue are invariably rewarded, while those of criminal bent (or those who simply misbehaved) are punished, often with ghoulish glee. A few characters manage to \\"repent of their evil ways,\\" but mostly, the respective dispositions are starkly fixed in black and white. Recordings Fountain produced at least six full-length LPs.

With port facilities in Drammen, Oslo and Malm√∂, Autolink prepares and redistributes to dealerships three quarters of all automobiles in Norway. The company has outsourcing agreements with many of the largest automotive importers in the country. It also owns the railway company Cargolink and the shipping company Motorships. Operations Autolink has 200 employees and NOK 430 million in revenue. Head offices are located in Drammen, while additional facilities are located in Oslo. In Sweden, Autolink has established itself in Malm√∂ through the subsidiary Autolink Sweden AB. The Swedish division has 40 employees. The company imports 90,000 automobiles per year. The company was formerly known as Drammen Bilhavn, and is privately owned. Transport from the factory, or from large, central ports in Europe to Norway is performed by the subsidiary Motorships using car carriers, with 150 annual calls. At the import terminal, all cars are quality controlled. The terminals in Drammen and Oslo have storage capacity for 11,000 vehicles. Autolink also offeres a wide range of installation and customization services. Transport wax is removed on all cars. Distribution is performed by autorack train from Drammen and Oslo. The subsidiary Cargolink operates ten Di 6 locomotives and more than 100 autoracks, and annually distributions 50,000 automobiles on 600 trains to terminals in Stavanger, Bergen, √Öndalsnes, Trondheim, Mosj√∏en, Mo i Rana, Bod√∏ and Narvik. At the terminals, Autolink redistributes the automobiles using 60 trucks to the dealerships. =Cargolink= Work with establishing the new company was initiated by Autolink in March 2008, with the company formally established on 27 March. It received an operating license from the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate on 18 September 2008. Five shunters that were operated by Ofotbanen, but owned by Autolink, were transferred to Cargolink. In addition, four Di 6 diesel locomotives have been leased from Vossloh, with options for later purchase. Operations started on 2 November. History=Ofotbanen= Traditionally, Autolink had used the Norwegian State Railways, and subsequently their subsidiary CargoNet, for operation of the autorack trains. On 31 January 2007, Autolink bought 40% of the private railway company Ofotbanen, and transferred the freight contract to them. This made Autolink Ofotbanen's largest customer. In March, Ofotbanen ordered additional 70 new autoracks for NOK 175 million. Ofotbanen had since their establishment had economic problems. The contract with Autolink had helped, but in July 2008, Autolink cancelled their contract with Ofotbanen. Two weeks later, Autolink announced that they would establish their own railway company, which they had been working with since April. They stated that the deal with Ofotbanen was discontinued because the majority owner‚ÄîRail Management, owned by Michael Steimler‚Äîwould not allow additional private placements of capital, nor sell their shares to Autolink. From 29 July all automotive trains stopped running, and no cars were transported for ten days. The same day, all board members in Ofotbanen from Autolink withdrew their positions. The matter ended in court, regarding the matter of if Autolink should be allowed to take control over four train radios that were located in locomotives owned by Autolink, but operated by Ofotbanen. In a shareholder agreement between Autolink and Rail Management, the ownership of the train radios had been transferred to Autolink, but the agreement has clauses that specified that Autolink could not start a competing railway company. Stating that Autolink had behaved disloyal with regard to the contract, Ofoten District Court ruled on 17 July 2008 against Autolink's demand for an interim order to transfer the ownership to Autolink. The court ruled that an interim decision could not be made due to the complexity of the contracts, and that a normal lawsuit would have to be carried out to determine the matter. What was agreed upon was that Autolink on 13 February 2008 had bought five shunters from Ofotbanen for NOK 12 million, of which NOK 9.5 million was paid by Autolink deleting debt. Ofotbanen lost their license from the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate on 7 October 2008 at 12:00. This was because Ofotbanen had not documented necessary accounts for 2007, nor provided evidence of necessary liquidity. On 24 October, the company was declared bankrupt. Rail Management subsequently established the new company Ofotbanen Drift, and stated that the cause of the bankruptcy was that Autolink had not let them make a private placement of NOK 10 million.

Born in Baltimore, Maryland on November 15, 1891, he graduated from The Boys' Latin School of Maryland in 1910 and Cornell University in 1914. He served in the American military during World War I, becoming the youngest major in the United States Army at the time of his appointment in 1917. After the war, he was employed as an investment banker by the Wall Street stockbrokerage firm W.E. Hutton & Co., where he eventually became a partner. He was later associated with CBS as an investor, chairman of the finance committee and, for 47 years starting in 1932, a member of the board of directors. He was one of the investors in a Clarence Miles-led group that successfully purchased the St. Louis Browns from Bill Veeck on September 29, 1953, moving the franchise to Baltimore and renaming it the Orioles for the season. He was appointed the team's chairman of the board after Miles' resignation in early November, 1955. Iglehart eventually became the largest individual shareholder, with a 32% stake in the ballclub, which emerged as a legitimate pennant contender by on the strength of its scouting, player development and farm system. When the New York Yankees' sale to CBS was finalized on September 9, 1964, he found himself in violation of an MLB rule concerning conflict of interest. He ended up selling his 64,000 shares to another original Orioles investor, the National Brewing Company, for $1.6 million on May 25, 1965. The brewery gained controlling interest at 65%, with its president, Jerold Hoffberger, succeeding Iglehart as board chairman. Oddly enough, the day after the sale, the National Gypsum Company (now part of Lafarge), another enterprise of which he was on the board, rechristened in his honor a deep sea tanker that was converted into what was then the world's largest self-unloading cement-carrying laker - the J.A.W. Iglehart. After leaving the Orioles, he served on the Yankees' board of directors until the team was sold in January, 1973 to an investment group led by George Steinbrenner. He spent one more season with the Bronx Bombers as a consulting partner. Iglehart died in Lutherville, Maryland on November 16, 1979, just one day after his 88th birthday. The lake freighter J.A.W.

It is located 17 km east of Daru, the provincial capital of Western Province (Papua New Guinea), at the southernmost extreme of the Fly River delta, and at the northeastern corner of the Torres Strait. It is the northernmost of the Torres Strait Islands, and at the same time the southernmost of the Fly River delta. Bampton Point, its southernmost point, marks the southwestern corner of the Gulf of Papua. The Coral Sea is southeast. Torres Strait is south and southwest, specifically the Great Northeast Channel, which separates Parama Island from the closest Australian (Queensland) island, Bramble Cay, 48 km ESE. Parama is roughly rectangular in shape, 9.6 km long and up to 5.7 km wide, with a shore length of 27.7 km and an area of 37 km¬≤. It is a low, flat, muddy and mangrove covered island. It is separated from the mainland by Toro Passage, which is 400 to 700 meters wide and seven kilometers long, and 1.8 to 5.5 meters deep. All of the population of 441 (as of the Census 2000) live in Parama village on the eastern side, facing the Gulf of Papua. The figure for 1991 was 240. Only the area around the village is cultivated. The village is divided into six clan divisions.

In 1842 he inherited his uncle's 1600-acre plantation and 150 slaves, becoming a major planter and slaveholder in the state, and giving up his general medical practice. Steuart was instrumental in the expansion and modernisation of The Maryland Hospital for the Insane, today known as the Spring Grove Hospital Center. The expansion of the hospital, which Steuart considered his life's work, was authorized by the Maryland legislature in the 1850s and completed after the end of the Civil War. At the start of the American Civil War, Steuart was relieved of his position as superintendent of the hospital because he refused to sign an oath of loyalty to the Union. Despite being a slave state, Maryland did not secede, and Federal troops entered the state to ensure it remained in the Union. A known Confederate sympathiser, Steuart remained a fugitive for much of the war, smuggling medical supplies to the South. At the war's end, Steuart was reinstated as superintendent at the hospital, and achieved the opening of the new building in 1872, continuing as superintendent almost until his death in 1876. Spring Grove continues to treat mental illness in the 21st century, and is the second oldest institution of its kind in the United States. Early life Steuart was born in Baltimore, Maryland, in November 1797, a younger son of physician Dr James Steuart and his wife Rebecca. He was the fourth of eight siblings. Two died in infancy of scarlet fever. Steuart was raised at the family mansion at Maryland Square Nelker, p.133 and educated at St Mary's College, Baltimore. Through his sister, Elizabeth Sprigg Steuart (1803-1896), he was the uncle of Charles William Kinsey (1829-1883), who served as a Virginia Congressman from 1882 to 1883, and was a Major in the Confederate Army, who was a friend of Gen. Stonewall Jackson, and was present at his death. =War of 1812= During the War of 1812, at the age of seventeen, Steuart volunteered as aide-de-camp to the Washington Blues, a company of militia raised and commanded by his older brother, Captain (later Major General) George H. Steuart (1790‚Äì1867). He served at the Battle of North Point on September 12, 1814, where the Maryland Militia were able to hold off a British attack long enough to shore up the defense of Baltimore.Nelker, Memoirs of Richard Sprigg Steuart, p. 136. As he later recalled in his memoirs: :\\"I found my little knowledge of surgery very useful. One of the soldiers had been shot through the thigh wounding the femoral artory {sic}, so...I made a tourniquet, arresting the flow of blood, to place him in my wagon and bring him to the Maryland hospital. Here surgeon Gibson received him and finally amputated his leg.\\" Medical career Medicine case of Richard Sprigg Steuart. After the war, Steuart began the study of law under Brigadier General William H. Winder. He had commanded the United States forces at the Battle of Bladensberg and was court-martialled afterward. However, Steuart abandoned law in favor of medicine, which he studied under Dr William Donaldson in 1818 at Maryland Medical University. He graduated with his M.D. in 1822, publishing in the same year a work On the Action of Arteries.Quinan, John Russel, p.163, Medical Annals of Baltimore from 1608 to 1880, BiblioLife (2008); Retrieved Jan 2010 After graduation he went into partnership with Donaldson at his general medical practice in Baltimore for seventeen years. After Donaldson's death, Steuart succeeded to the practice. Early on he began to specialize in the relatively neglected field of mental illness. In 1834 he became President of the Board of Visitors of the Maryland Hospital for the Insane. In 1843 Steuart was elected to the Professorship of the Theory and Practice of Physic at the University of Maryland.p.391, Maryland Medical and Surgical Journal, Volume 3 Retrieved March 11, 2010 Later, in 1848‚Äì49, and again from 1850‚Äì51, he served as president of the Medical and Chirurgical faculty of the State of Maryland.Transactions of the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty of the State of Maryland, p38, Retrieved March 8, 2010 By 1853 he was described by the American Journal of the Medical Sciences as \\"well known as one of the most eminent physicians of this city [of Baltimore]\\",p. 547, The American Journal of the Medical Sciences, Volume 26 (1853). Retrieved March 11, 2010 =Maryland Hospital for the Insane= Spring Grove. Dorothea Dix lobbied for reform of the treatment of mental illness in Maryland. Steuart's most notable contribution to the field of mental illness was his work for the Maryland Hospital for the Insane (founded in 1797). He became President of the Board and Medical Superintendent, and its operations became his life's work. By the mid-nineteenth century, the hospital's bed capacity was no longer adequate, and Steuart managed to obtain authorization and funding from the Maryland General Assembly for the construction of a new, larger facility at Spring Grove. In co-operation with the social reformer Dorothea Dix, who in 1852 gave an impassioned speech to the Maryland legislature, Steuart chaired the committee known as the Commissioners for Erecting a Hospital for the Insane, that selected the Hospital's present site in Catonsville. The cost of purchasing of land for the hospital was $14,000, of which $12,340 was raised through private contributions, with Steuart himself personally contributing $1,000, a very large sum at the time. The purchase was completed in 1853, but construction of the new buildings was delayed by the onset of the Civil War.

Tobacco planter and slaveholder Dodon, on the South River near Annapolis. In 1842 Steuart inherited from his uncle William Steuart a large tobacco plantation, comprising around of land and about 150 slaves, at Dodon, near the South River in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. Steuart's grandfather George H. Steuart had purchased and developed Dodon in around 1740. This inheritance made Steuart a wealthy landowner and a significant slaveholder in the state. As a result, Steuart gave up his general medical practice, after what he described as \\"23 years of hard professional life,\\"Nelker, p137, Memoirs of Richard Sprigg Steuart in order to concentrate on managing his new plantation. =The problem of slavery= Cape Palmas, a colony for free blacks founded in Liberia by the Maryland State Colonization Society. Like many Southern slaveholders, Steuart held conflicting views on the question of slavery. Although he recognized that the South's \\"peculiar institution\\" could not continue indefinitely, he was hostile to abolitionist efforts to mandate its end. From 1828 Steuart had served on the Board of Managers of the Maryland State Colonization Society, of which Charles Carroll of Carrollton, one of the co-signers of the Declaration of Independence, was president. Steuart's father, James Steuart, was vice-president, and his brother George H. Steuart was also on the Board.The African Repository, Volume 3, 1827, p.251, edited by Ralph Randolph Gurley Retrieved Jan 15 2010 The MSCS was a branch of the American Colonization Society, an organization dedicated to \\"returning\\" free black Americans to Africa, and specifically to found a colony for their resettlement, which developed as Liberia.The African Repository, Volume 14, p.42 Retrieved March 10, 2010 By this time, most African Americans were native-born in the US, and many preferred to work for their civil rights there. In an 1845 open letter to editor John L. Carey of the Commercial Daily Advertiser in Baltimore, published in the city by printer John Murphy, Steuart asked rhetorically: :\\"is there a man in Maryland, is there a single man connected with slavery who does not feel its existence to be a curse upon our beautiful land? Is there one who has not many a time...expressed a fond hope that he might live to witness...the entire exodus of the negro race from among us? If there is such a man, I have never met with him here...indeed it is impossible for a man of sound judgment and feelings...to behold the power and prosperity of Pennsylvania and Ohio...in comparison with our own state, and not feel the deepest regret for our deficiencies.\\"Richard Sprigg Steuart, Letter to John Carey 1845, p.4. Retrieved Jan 21 2010 Carey had himself written about the vexing question of slavery and also belonged to the Colonization Society. Steuart was envious of the greater relative prosperity of the Northern States, and especially their much greater population growth. In Maryland, he argued, slavery held back economic progress: :\\"It is a matter of common observation that white laborers will not settle where slaves occupy the soil, however partially they may do so among free negroes. The white man shrinks from a union of labor with those who are regarded by their masters as an inferior race, and gradually he comes to regard labor itself as degrading, and fit only for those whom heaven has stamped with a color darker than his own.\\"Richard Sprigg Steuart, Letter to John Carey 1845, p.5. Retrieved Jan 21 2010 Although he may have opposed the institution of slavery in principle, Steuart strongly resisted what he considered to be the radical agenda of the Abolitionists. Instead, he recommended voluntary emancipation by slave holders, and \\"repatriation\\" [with such terms, whites ignored that most African Americans were native to the US] to Africa of free black settlers: :\\"The colored man [must] look to Africa, as his only hope of preservation and of happiness...it will be found that this course of procedure...will...secure the removal of the great body of the African people from our State. The President of the Maryland Colonization Society says \\"the object of Colonization is to prepare a home in Africa for the free colored people of the State, to which they may remove when the advantages which it offers, and above all the pressure of irresistible circumstances in this country, shall excite them to emigrate.\\"Richard Sprigg Steuart, Letter to John Carey 1845, pp.10-11. Retrieved Jan 21 2010 Despite legislative efforts to reduce manumissions of slaves and forbid entry of free blacks into the state, by 1860, free blacks (many of them free people of color) made up 49% of the black population in the state. Civil War Baltimore riot of April 1861. At the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Steuart and his family were sympathetic to the Southern cause. Maryland did not secede from the Union. Pre-war loyalties in Maryland were divided between North and South, but the Northern cause prevailed. In April, the city was shaken by the Baltimore riot of 1861, as Union soldiers were attacked who were traveling through the city by rail. Steuart wrote: :\\"I happened to be in Baltimore on the night of the 19th April 1861, and witnessed the outburst of feeling on the part of the people. Generally, when the Massachusetts troops were passing thru the city of Baltimore, it was evident to me that 75 p.c. of the population was in favour of repelling these troops. Instinctively the people seemed to look upon them as intruders, or as invaders of the South, not as defenders of the City of Baltimore. How or by whom the first blow was given can not be now ascertained, but the feeling of resistance was contagious and powerful. The Mayor of the City, nevertheless, thought it his duty to keep the peace and protect these troops in their passage thru Baltimore.\\" Mitchell, Charles W., p.101, Maryland voices of the Civil War. Retrieved February 26, 2010 Steuart was among those who lobbied Governor Hicks to summon the state Legislature to vote on secession, following Hicks to Annapolis with a number of fellow citizens: :\\"to insist on his [Hicks] issuing his proclamation for the Legislature to convene, believing that this body (and not himself and his party) should decide the fate of our state\\"...if the Governor and his party continued to refuse this demand that it would be necessary to depose him\\".Mitchell, p.71 On April 22 Governor Hicks finally announced that the state legislature would meet in a special session in Frederick, Maryland, a strongly pro-Union town. In the end, Steuart's efforts to persuade Maryland to secede from the Union were in vain. On April 29, the Maryland Legislature voted 53‚Äì13 against secession. The state was swiftly occupied by Union soldiers to prevent any reconsideration. =Fugitive= The political situation remained uncertain until May 13, 1861 when Union troops occupied the state, restoring order and preventing a vote in favour of Southern secession, and by late summer Maryland was firmly in the hands of Union soldiers. Arrests of Confederate sympathizers soon followed, and Steuart's brother, Major General Steuart, fled to Charlottesville, Virginia, after which much of his family's property was confiscated by the Federal Government.Brugger, Robert J., p.280, Maryland, A Middle Temperament: 1634-1980 Retrieved Feb 28 2010 The family's Baltimore residence, Maryland Square, was seized by the Union Army and Jarvis Hospital was soon erected on the grounds of the estate, to care for Federal wounded.Nelker, p.120 George H. \\"Maryland\\" Steuart. Dodon was not confiscated by the Union but, during the course of the war, horses were raised and trained and then smuggled south for Confederate forces, as well as medical supplies such as quinine. As a result, Dodon was often raided by Union troops, frequently forcing Steuart to flee into hiding.Nelker, 150 According to a family memoir: :\\"Dr Steuart was constantly away from home, avoiding the raiding parties from the Northern soldiers who sought to capture him, because of the help he gave the South by secretly sending supplies of quinine, and other necessities...to the Southern hospitals. Wakened...in the dead of night, [his wife Maria] dressed quietly and...admitted the Northern soldiers, and then stealing past the sentries, walked half a mile to the 'quarters', and sent a trusty messenger to warn his master not to return. Old William Hawkins, when a soldier put a pistol to his head saying 'tell us where your master is', replied 'I'd rather be dead than tell'.\\"Nelker, p150 Steuart's support for the Confederacy came at a high price. He was relieved of his duties at the Hospital after he refused to sign an oath of loyalty to the Union.Helsel, David S., p.19, Spring Grove State Hospital Retrieved February 26, 2010 Later that year, the Baltimore resident W W Glenn described Steuart as a fugitive from the authorities: :\\"I was spending the evening out when a footstep approached my chair from behind and a hand was laid upon me. I turned and saw Dr. R. S. Steuart. He has been concealed for more than six months. His neighbors are so bitter against him that he dare not go home, and he committed himself so decidedly on the 19th April and is known to be so decided a Southerner, that it [is] more than likely he would be thrown into a Fort. He goes about from place to place, sometimes staying in one county, sometimes in another and then passing a few days in the city. He never shows in the day time & is cautious who sees him at any time. He has several negroes in his confidence at different places.\\" Mitchell, Charles W., p.285, Maryland Voices of the Civil War Retrieved February 26, 2010 =After the war= After the war, in 1868, Steuart was eventually reinstated to the hospital as superintendent, and remained in charge when its operations moved to the newly completed hospital at Spring Grove in 1872, thereby living to see the fulfillment of his life's work and ambition. However, he was once again removed in 1875 when the board, under his leadership, mortgaged the hospital to a group of private investors, after the Maryland Legislature had failed to fully fund its operations. He gave an address in 1876 to the Alumni Association of Maryland Medical University, but died the same year on July 13, and is buried at his family estate of Dodon in Maryland.

It was fought between a force of 10,000 men led by the Earl of Lennox and a force of 2,500 led by James Hamilton, 1st Earl of Arran. The battle was part of a power struggle in Scotland for control of the young Scottish king, James V. The battlefield was added to the national Inventory of Historic Battlefields in Scotland prepared by Historic Scotland under the Scottish Historical Environment Policy of 2009.Inventory of Battlefields historic-scotland.gov.uk. Retrieved 31 August 2014. Background The Battle of Linlithgow Bridge was a product of the power vacuum created by the death of James IV of Scotland in the Battle of Flodden in 1513. His young son, James V, was only a year old when his father was killed, and so Scotland was ruled by regents during his childhood. The first was his mother, Margaret Tudor (sister of King Henry VIII of England), until she remarried in the following year, and was replaced by John Stewart, 2nd Duke of Albany, who was himself next in line for the throne after James and his younger brother, Alexander Stewart, Duke of Ross. In 1525, Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus, the young king's stepfather, took custody of James and held him as a virtual prisoner for three years, exercising power on his behalf. James‚Äô mother made a number of attempts to free her son from the clutches of Douglas, and one of these resulted in the Battle of Linlithgow Bridge.Ken Emond, The Minority of James V (Edinburgh, 2019), pp. 244-5. The battle In 1526, Margaret persuaded the Earl of Lennox and Cardinal Beaton to support her cause. Lennox raised an army over 10,000 and marched on Edinburgh from his base in Stirling. By this time Archibald Douglas had won the support of James Hamilton, 1st Earl of Arran and the latter was sent to try to delay the march by mustering the people of Linlithgow and the surrounding area. Arran arranged his force of 2,500 men on the strategically important Pace Hill overlooking Linlithgow and the River Avon. Lennox, seeing the strength of this defensive position had to rethink his plans. Lennox intended to outflank and defeat Arran before Douglas could arrive from Edinburgh with reinforcements. Downstream from the town, the river was impassable but his scouts found a ford upstream, at Manuel Convent. Lennox forced a crossing there and advanced on Arran‚Äôs flank. However, Arran saw the threat and placed his troops facing south along the ridge of Pace Hill. Lennox‚Äôs attack was across the Avon, over boggy ground and finally uphill, but he very nearly succeeded in dislodging Arran‚Äôs outnumbered men. However time ran out for Lennox as Douglas reinforcements arrived followed by the reluctant King James. Many of the Lennox men were killed either on the ridge or along the banks of the river Avon. The Earl of Glencairn was captured and Lennox himself was wounded. It was said that Lennox surrendered to his opponents but was then murdered by James Hamilton of Finnart.Ken Emond, The Minority of James V (Edinburgh, 2019), p. 245. The location of Lennox‚Äôs murder is commemorated with a cairn that stands at the entrance to the Kettilstoun estate. The aftermath After the battle, James remained under the control of Archibald Douglas until, in 1528, aged sixteen, he escaped from Edinburgh to join his mother in Stirling and assume the reins of government himself. Douglas and his family had their lands confiscated and he was forced to seek refuge in England. James continued to reign until his death in 1542.

It was said that she was respectful and careful, and the people in the palace praised her for her virtues.  As imperial consort  In 805, Emperor Dezong died, and Li Song became emperor (as Emperor Shunzong). Just prior to Emperor Dezong's death, Emperor Shunzong himself had suffered a debilitating stroke, leaving him partially paralyzed and unable to speak.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 236.

By the end of the strike, eleven different LGSM groups had emerged throughout the UK, with the London group alone raising ¬£22,500 by 1985 () in support. History During the strike, the Thatcher administration sequestered the funds of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), meaning that it was pointless for supporters of the strike to send donations to the national union. Instead, support groups throughout the UK were encouraged to \\"twin\\" directly with the various mining communities in England, Scotland and Wales. Among these organisations, the LGSM was formed by Mark Ashton and his friends, after the two men collected donations for the miners at the 1984 Lesbian and Gay Pride march in London. The London LGSM group met and fundraised in numerous locations, including the Gay's the Word bookshop. The group grew rapidly and moved out of Gay's The Word to a larger venue: The Fallen Angel, a gay pub in Graham Street, Islington. The London group was twinned with the Neath, Dulais and Swansea Valleys Miners Support Groups. In November 1984, a group of lesbians broke away from LGSM to form a separate group, Lesbians Against Pit Closures, although some lesbians remained active in the LGSM campaign rather than joining the women-only group. In addition to raising approximately ¬£22,500 for the families who were on strike, there were reciprocal visits. The largest single fundraising event that LGSM organised was the \\"Pits and Perverts\\" benefit concert, which was held in the Electric Ballroom in Camden Town, London on 10 December 1984. The event was headlined by Bronski Beat and its lead singer, Jimmy Somerville. The title of the benefit is claimed by many to have originated as a headline in the British tabloid The Sun, but this remains unproven and probably erroneous.  Legacy  The alliances which the campaign forged between the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community and British labour groups proved to be an important turning point in the progression of LGBT issues in the United Kingdom. Miners' labour groups began to support, endorse and participate in various gay pride events throughout the UK, including leading London's Lesbian and Gay Pride parade in 1985. Additionally, at the 1985 Labour Party conference in Bournemouth, a resolution committing the party to the support of LGBT rights passed, due to block voting support from the National Union of Mineworkers. The miners' groups were also among the most outspoken allies of the LGBT community in the 1988 campaign against Section 28. An archive of the London group's work is kept at the People's History Museum in Manchester, England. It includes the minutes of the weekly meetings, correspondence, press cuttings, publicity material, enamel badges, photographs and the group's banner. The London group's alliance with the Welsh mining village of Onllwyn is dramatised in the 2014 film, Pride, which was directed by Matthew Warchus. Several of the surviving group members participated in the film's promotion. In 2015, following the film's release, the surviving members of the organisation held a 30th anniversary reunion to raise funds for the Mark Ashton Fund, an HIV/AIDS charitable fund administered by the Terrence Higgins Trust. The group was chosen to lead the 2015 Birmingham Pride parade, in recognition of their historic status. They were also slated to lead the 2015 Pride in London parade, but withdrew in favour of marching further back in the parade after organisers refused to allow other affiliated groups, such as trade union contingents, to march immediately alongside the LGSM. They also accepted invitations to 2015 Pride marches in Derry, Doncaster, Newcastle upon Tyne, Sunderland, Norwich, Liverpool Pride, Belfast and Leeds Pride. LGSM announced on 9 October 2015 that the group would \\"wind down as a current campaigning force\\", saying that they did not want to become \\"a LGBT version of the British Legion\\". The group elected four original core members to carry the legacy of the group onwards. These were Mike Jackson (Secretary), Dave Lewis (Press Officer), Martin Goodsell and Brett Haran (both Treasurers). The remit of the four is to continue fundraising by selling merchandise (t-shirts, badges, the book Pride, etc.); respond to speaker requests; develop and maintain the website and to attend directly related mineworkers' legacy events such as the Durham Miners' Gala. The legacy group gained the approval of a substantial majority of the former members in supporting Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader in August 2016. = Pride the book = The group were approached in 2016 by UK publisher John Blake Books to produce a book about LGSM and they accepted. Author Tim Tate was chosen. He made extensive audio recordings of original members of LGSM and the mining families and activists they twinned with in South Wales. These verbatim interviews are woven together with the author's explanatory narrative. The book was published in 2017 by John Blake, it is available both in paperback and digital editions.

It can be found in North America and Europe, and grows at the base of pine in Autumn. Its white milk stains fabric a sulphur yellow, from which its specific epithet derives. Taxonomy The original description of L. tabidus has been various ascribed to Elias Magnus Fries, and to Pierre Bulliard, while the synonymous specific name L. theiogalus is variously credited to Fries and Samuel Frederick Gray. The name theiogalus is from the Ancient Greek for \\"brimstone\\" (sulphur) and \\"milk\\". The mushroom has also been named L. chrysorrheus by Lucien Qu√©let, based on Fries's description, and Lactarius hepaticus, with the authority cited to Charles Bagge Plowright of the British Mycological Society and Jean Louis √âmile Boudier. Due to reclassification, Lactarius theiogalus is now considered to be a synonym of Lactarius tabidus, and the binomials Lactarius hepaticus and Lactarius chrysorrheus have been assigned to different Lactarius species. Description Lactarius tabidus has a convex cap of between 2.5 and 7 centimetres across, sometimes with a central umbo, that flattens with age. In colour, it varies between liver and a dull chestnut, and the surface is dry and matt. The margin is often has tiny lobes, and can be crimped or crisped. The stem typically measures between 3 and 7 centimetres in height, and is between 4 and 8 millimetres in width. In colour, the stem varies between a reddish-brown and brick coloured. The thin layer of flesh in the cap is a white-tinged pinkish buff colour, and the stem and cap become hollow with age. The pale buff gills are slightly decurrent, and with age become a deep buff to pale ochre colour, sometimes with a slight mauve colouration. The milk is white, drying yellow. The milk stains fabric a sulphur yellow colour in minutes. The spore print is cream, while the spores themselves are broadly elliptic with large warts. Most warts are joined by thin to thickish ridges, forming a very incomplete network. Other warts are isolated. The spores measure between 8 and 9 by between 6 and 7 micrometres in volume. Edibility The fruit bodies of L. tabidus are considered inedible. The milk has bitter and acrid taste, with a slightly hot aftertaste.

This was Young Maylay's first appearance in a single. What Will It Be was to be Deeyah's second single in the UK after a successful Top 30 release of Plan of My Own. The music video for What Will It Be was filmed in Mumbai, India. Throughout the music video people are shown removing tape from their mouths to illustrate a need for expressive freedom, particularly concerning women's right's, a woman's freedom of choice as well as sexuality. It is also, according to Deeyah, a response to critics that would hope to silence her musical voice and who have threatened Deeyah throughout her career in an attempt limit her freedom of expression. In Deeyah's view, the Muslim community needs to examine its own place in the world and treatment of women before turning its judgment outward towards the West. The video also refers to the double standards and hypocrisy of strictly patriarchal cultures based on honor and shame. In reoccurring scenes throughout the music video, images of individuals, especially women, are projected on Deeyah's bare back. Every person is someone who was murdered for his or her individual choices. The music video for What Will It Be was pulled from rotation as threats of violence mounted against UK television and music stations by the Muslim community increased. In the wake of these controversies, local Asian music channel B4U Music banned her videos.

History=Creation of Arran and split= Before 2012, the left-wing Catalan independence movement had two youth organizations: Maulets-JIR and CAJEI. The first was founded in 1999 through the union of Maulets (the youth wing of Catalunya Lliure) and the Catalan Revolutionary Youth (JIR, youth of People's Unity Assembly). The second group was created in 2002 by members of Endavant. Both organizations merged in 2012 creating Arran. Soon after the merge, some ex-members of Maulets-JIR (especially those close to the Movement for Defence of the Land), started to consider that the leadership of the new organization was following the political line of CAJEI. These ex-members of Maulets-JIR became involved in the creation of the youth of the Catalan National Assembly (ANC), the National Assembly of Pro-Independence Youth (ANJI). Due to this, they were threatened with expulsion from Arran.Passat, present i futur de l‚Äôesquerra independentista. El Temps, 23 July 2018. In 2014, groups of ex-Maulets created, along with other youth organizations, the Estudiants 9N movement, which organized a student strike to support the unofficial self-determination referendum. During the referendum campaign, some local chapters of Arran (Arb√∫cies, for example) made posters promoting a 'Yes' vote; the leadership of Arran ordered that these posters be withdrawn. At the national assembly of that year, most members of Arran voted to expel those who had participated in the ANC. Their objection stems from the ANC's stance to fight only for the independence of Catalonia and not all of the Catalan Countries. The vote was not valid because it did not reach the 70% of necessary quorum.Tres d√®cades de l‚Äôinici del ‚Äúcombat maulet‚Äù. Ara, 24 September 2018.

Her leadership was supported by major religious leaders in Harlem: Dr. Preston Washington, Dr. Frederick B. Williams, Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker, Dr. Calvin O. Butts, Bishop Norman N. Quick, Dr. James A.

The Harlem Week of Prayer and mobilization began to receive national attention. Seele was invited to churches and public health groups in other cities to speak about it. Seele's effort to address public health issues through communities of faith received technical assistance and support from the federal government. She received funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to expand the program to six pilot cities.

Born in Hawaii, \\"Allen\\" soon became obsessed with a series of novels, the protagonist of which shared his name. Due to \\"Allen's\\" anonymity, it is unclear what the series was, apart from the fact that it was science fiction. Some have theorized that the series was the \\"Barsoom\\" books, by Edgar Rice Burroughs, featuring the main character \\"John Carter\\".The first in the Barsoom series. The character of \\"John Carter\\" is seen at left. \\"Allen\\" attended University, and became a scientist, working with the United States Military on a classified research project during World War II, which helped to bring about the war's end. Meanwhile, convinced that the novels were his personal biography, he \\"filled in\\" many omitted details from the novels, from his own \\"recollection\\". He was incredibly thorough, creating full-color maps, sketches, a glossary of names and terms, socio- economic data, etcetera. In his own words: > ‚ÄúMy first effort, then, was to remember. I started by fixing in my mind, and > later on paper in the forms of maps, genealogical tables, and so on, what > the author of my biography had put down. When I had this mastered, by > remembering I was able to correct his errors, fill in many details, and > close gaps between one volume of the biography and the next.\\" Eventually, he reached the outer limits of the scope of the novels, and began to \\"recall\\" his/the character's further adventures. He even began to hallucinate being in the various settings of his stories, physically experiencing them. Soon, his employers became aware of his psychotic condition, and demanded that he get psychiatric treatment. Reluctantly, he conceded. His psychoanalyst was Lindner, who would eventually write a popular case-study of Allen. Lindner eventually cured Allen, by immersing himself in the fantasy world, but in the process became himself obsessed. Paul Linebarger (better known by his nom de plume, Cordwainer Smith) was long rumored to have been the original \\"Kirk Allen,\\" Lindner, Robert. The Fifty-Minute Hour. New York: Holt, Rinehart & Winston, 1954. According to Cordwainer Smith scholar Alan C.

Billion Year Spree: The True History of Science Fiction. New York: Doubleday, 1973. More recently, both Elms and librarian Lee WeinsteinWeinstein, Lee. \\"In Search of Kirk Allen,\\" New York Review of Science Fiction, April 2001. have gathered circumstantial evidence to support the case for Linebarger's being \\"Allen,\\" but both concede there is no direct proof that Linebarger was ever a patient of Lindner's or that he suffered from a disorder similar to that of \\"Allen\\". See also 'Cordwainer Smith Scholarly Corner' by Alan C. Elms (Although no direct link between Linebarger and Lindner has ever been proved, personalities in the science fiction world whom Lindner is known to have been personally acquainted with include Ted Sturgeon, who was in psychoanalysis with an analyst recommended to him by Lindner,Sturgeon, Ted. And Now the News (2002), story notes by Paul Williams to \\"The Other Man\\" and \\"And Now the News.\\" and Philip Wylie, the author of When Worlds Collide and Gladiator, whom Lindner psychoanalyzed in 1952).Gardner, R.H. \\"Goodness Snakes! Author of 'Vipers' Fame Calming Down\\", Baltimore Sun, Sept. 21, 1952, p. 36. Physicist Saul-Paul Sirag has theorized that Allen was really a research physicist named Francis Burton \\"Kiko\\" Harrison II, son of American politician and diplomat Francis Burton Harrison, citing areas of biographical similarity as well as a few possible instances of deliberate obfuscation. In popular culture In 2011, Stan Lee created the comic book series Starborn, based on Allen's story. Carl Sagan wrote about this case in Chapter 10 of his book The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, Ballantine Books, March 1996. Jacques Vallee wrote about the case in his book Revelations: Alien Contact and Human Deception, comparing it to the Ummo phenomenon. Thierry Smolderen & Alexandre Cl√©risse's graphic novel Atomic Empire depicts Allen's story, identifying Allen with Cordwainer Smith.

Trees include the rare wild service tree, particularly in The Odd Quarter. There is ground flora typical of ancient woodland, together with woodland rides, ponds, streams, and herb-rich grassland.

It was a high-wing monoplane with an inline engine, fixed undercarriage and single, open cockpit, designed as an advanced trainer. Only one aircraft was produced, in 1933-4, as a testpiece for the Air Ministry. Development Henschel & Son of Kassel were originally known as manufacturers of locomotives, though they later produced lorries and buses. In 1933 they set up an aviation subsidiary based at Sch√∂nefeld with a branch at Johannisthal. New aircraft manufacturers who intended to produce aircraft for the Luftwaffe had first to make a testpiece or masterpiece (Befahigungsnachweis) to prove their competence and the Hs 121 was Henschel's offering. It was a high-wing braced monoplane, with gull wing roots to enhance the pilot's forward view from the open cockpit set well back behind the trailing edge. The wing was built around two metal spars with metal-covered leading edges and fabric elsewhere. There was solid bracing from near mid-wing to the lower fuselage and from this bracing inwards to the shoulder of the gull wing. The oval fuselage had a metal structure with metal covering. The tail was also a metal structure, with metal covering on the fin and tailplane but with fabric-covered control surfaces. There was wire bracing between fin and tailplane. The spatted main-wheels were carried on streamlined legs which angled outwards from the lower fuselage to increase the track. Power was from a 180 kW (240 hp) Argus As 10C inverted in-line engine. It flew for the first time at Johannisthal on 4 January 1934. A test flight programme produced some modifications: the fin was braced, the tailplane extended and more bracing was added between the landing gear and the fuselage. Only one Hs 121 was built.

He was drafted by the Saints in the fifth round of the 2009 NFL Draft. He played college football at SMU. Early years Morstead was born in Houston, Texas and was raised in a nearby suburb of Pearland, Texas. He has one brother, Patrick. He attended Pearland High School and won varsity letters in football and basketball. In football, as a senior, Morstead received second-team All- District honors and was named the Brazoria County Special Teams MVP. He was also a member of the National Honor Society, adding Academic All-State honors. College career Morstead enrolled at Southern Methodist in 2004, turning down scholarship offers from Texas Christian, Rice, Texas and Missouri, but spent the season as a redshirt. He was a member of the Conference USA's Academic Honor Roll in 2005, but never appeared in a game. Morstead took over place-kicking and punting chores in 2006, earning All-Conference USA third- team honors. He led the league and ranked 15th in the nation in punting, averaging 43.82 yards on 50 attempts, the best average by an SMU punter since Craig James averaged 44.9 yards in 1982. He made 13 of 18 field goals and 34 of 35 extra points for a total of 73 points. He also recorded one solo tackle. As a sophomore, Morstead was a consensus All-Conference USA first-team pick and also gained league academic honors. He again led C-USA and finished eighth nationally with a 44.65-yard average, as the Mustangs also ranked fourth in the NCAA with a 39.33-yard net average. He scored 82 points and set the league single-season record by making all 43 PAT attempts, as he also connected on 13 of 20 field goals. Morstead concentrated more on directional punting in 2008. The All-Conference USA honorable mention averaged a career-low 41.78 yards on 59 punts, but only 19 were returned, as the Mustangs placed third in the league with a 37.22-yard net average. He made 11 of 15 field goals, 29 of 30 extra points and amassed 62 points. Morstead missed three kicks inside of 40 yards in 2008, four in both 2006 and 2007. Professional career Morstead was drafted in the fifth round of the 2009 NFL Draft with the 164th overall selection by the New Orleans Saints. He was the second punter chosen in 2009, after Kevin Huber (by the Cincinnati Bengals). Morstead beat out Glenn Pakulak for the Saints' punting job in 2009. He played a critical role in the Saints' victory over the Indianapolis Colts in Super Bowl XLIV. Morstead executed an onside kick during the second half kickoff. The Saints recovered the ball and were able to convert that possession into a touchdown and a 13‚Äì10 lead. The Saints would eventually win the game 31‚Äì17. After the game, Morstead stated that while he was excited about executing the play, he was also terrified knowing that if the play was not executed perfectly, the Colts would have likely recovered the ball with a shot of extending their 10‚Äì6 lead. He currently holds the record for most kickoff touchbacks in one game (9 in a 62‚Äì7 defeat of the Indianapolis Colts on October 23, 2011) and the record for the most touchbacks in a single season (68 in 2011). In July 2012, the Saints signed Morstead to a six-year extension stated to be worth $21.9 million, making him the second highest paid punter in the league (after Shane Lechler of the Oakland Raiders). He went on to have an outstanding season, leading the league (with a record-setting pace through 15 games) in net punting yardage, and was elected to the Pro Bowl. Before the 2014 season, Morstead was selected as the Saints' special teams captain, and he retained the title in 2015. In the NFC Divisional matchup versus the Minnesota Vikings, Morstead tore cartilage in his rib cage after making a tackle in the first quarter, but remained in the game. The Vikings scored the winning touchdown in the closing seconds of the game, and both sides assumed that the contest was over with Saints players headed for the locker room, however Morstead was the first player to return to the field for the extra point attempt.https://www.nola.com/sports/saints/article_02498608-4fd8-5732-ae60-a9db99de0960.html Vikings' fans were impressed by the toughness and sportsmanship Morstead displayed in the eventual defeat, so a Vikings-dedicated Reddit group donated more than $140,000 to his charity in less than 24 hours, and Morstead presented the donations to the Children's Hospital of Minnesota. On March 16, 2018, Morstead signed a five-year contract extension with the Saints. In Week 3 of the 2019 season, Morstead downed four of his six punts inside the 20-yard-line in a 33-27 win over the Seahawks, earning him NFC Special Teams Player of the Week. In Week 6, Morstead pinned five of his six punts inside the 20-yard line with a long of 51 yards in a 13-6 win over the Jaguars, earning him his second NFC Special Teams Player of the Week honors of 2019. He was also named NFC Special Teams Player of the Month for September. In Week 1 of the 2020 season against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Morstead had 5 punts inside the 20 yard line during the 34‚Äì23 win. He was named the NFC Special Teams Player of the Week for his performance in Week 1. Personal life Morstead is married to Lauren Morstead. They have four children together. Morstead is a Christian. Morstead and his wife, Lauren, created the charity What You Give Will Grow in 2014. To date, the organization has given over $2,500,000 to various causes.

He defied Charles I over ship money. Life Hutton was born and brought up at Hutton Hall in Penrith, Cumbria, the son of Anthony Hutton. He went to Jesus College, Cambridge, to study divinity but aged 20 headed to London to pursue a career in law. He was called to the bar in 1586 and was made a serjeant-at-law in 1603 under Elizabeth I. At this time, Hutton bought the estate at Goldsborough, near Knaresborough, North Yorkshire from the Goldsborough family, whose original thatched moated manor house had been destroyed after a quarrel over succession. Sir Richard Hutton bought out the claimants to the estate and built the present Goldsborough Hall to the south east of the village on raised ground close to the church. Hutton was made Recorder of York in 1608, Doncaster in 1609 and Ripon in 1610. He held these offices until 1617 when he was knighted by King James I on a visit to York and made judge of the Court of Common Pleas (England). Hutton was well thought of under Charles I and became acting Chief Justice of the Common Pleas for a year from December 1625 to November 1626. He was a friend and relative of Matthew Hutton (Archbishop of York) (1529‚Äì1606). =Ship Money= All judges were asked to sign a declaration in favour of ship money, a disputed tax, in 1635. Hutton signed it but in 1638 ruled against the King in favour of John Hampden and admitted he was against the tax, saying that such a charge might not be imposed by the king's \\"original writ only under the great seal, without parliament,... unless in time of actual war and invasion\\". After the judgement, one of the High Church clergy, the Revd Thomas Harrison, accused Hutton of high treason. He was prosecuted, imprisoned and fined ¬£5,000. There is an account of the trial in Hutton's Diary and he won ¬£10,000 in damages. Hutton died at Serjeant's Inn in 1639 and was buried, as requested, at St Dunstan-in-the-West, Fleet Street, London. Goldsborough Hall and his estates then passed to his son and heir, Sir Richard Hutton, the younger (knighted in 1625). Charles I called him \\"his honest judge\\". Hutton kept a diary from 1614 until his death in 1639 which was edited by W R Prest. Family Sir Richard married Agnes Briggs of Cawmire, Westmorland, in 1591, the daughter and heiress of Thomas Briggs of Cawmire. They had four sons and five daughters. His second son, Sir Richard Hutton the younger (1617‚Äì1645) succeeded him after the death of his eldest son, Christopher, aged 24, who died after a sea voyage.

He created the Osmanya alphabet for writing Somali. Biography Kenadid grew up in the town of Galkayo, situated in north-central present-day Somalia. He served as a leader in the Majeerteen Sultanate of Hobyo and was the son of the polity's founder, Sultan Yusuf Ali Kenadid. Also a writer, Kenadid published many works on various subjects related to Somali history and science, including textbooks on the Somali language, astronomy, geography and Somali philosophy. He borrowed significantly from the vast ancient Somali cultural repository, working towards a renaissance of this rich past. In the early 1920s, in response to a national campaign to settle on a standard orthography for the Somali language (which had long lost its ancient script), Kenadid devised a phonetically sophisticated alphabet called Osmanya for representing the sounds of Somali. Kenadid's Osmanya was subsequently introduced into the local schools in his Sultanate. When the Italian colonial authorities got wind of this, they promptly imprisoned him in Mogadishu since they feared that the script was a manifestation of nationalism.Irving Kaplan, Area handbook for Somalia, (U.S. Govt.

With a summit elevation of , it is the highest mountain in the U.S. state of Washington and the Cascade Range, the most topographically prominent mountain in the contiguous United States, and the tallest in the Cascade Volcanic Arc. Due to its high probability of eruption in the near future, Mt. Rainier is considered one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world, and it is on the Decade Volcano list. The large amount of glacial ice means that Mt. Rainier could produce massive lahars which could threaten the entire Puyallup River valley. According to the United States Geological Survey, \\"about 80,000 people and their homes are at risk in Mount Rainier‚Äôs lahar-hazard zones.\\" Name Mount Rainier was first known by the local Salishan speakers as Talol, Tacoma, or Tahoma. One hypothesis of the word origin is 'mother of waters' in the Lushootseed language spoken by the Puyallup people. The linguist William Bright gives the origin as 'snow-covered mountain'. Another hypothesis is that Tacoma means \\"larger than Mount Baker\\" in Lushootseed: Ta 'larger', plus Koma (Kulshan), (Mount Baker). Other names originally used include Tahoma, Tacobeh, and Pooskaus. The current name was given by George Vancouver, who named it in honor of his friend, Rear Admiral Peter Rainier. The map of the Lewis and Clark expedition of 1804‚Äì1806 refers to it as Mt. Regniere. Although Rainier had been considered the official name of the mountain, Theodore Winthrop, in his posthumously published 1862 travel book The Canoe and the Saddle, referred to the mountain as Tacoma and for a time, both names were used interchangeably, although Mt. Tacoma was preferred in the nearby city of Tacoma. In 1890, the United States Board on Geographic Names declared that the mountain would be known as Rainier. Following this in 1897, the Pacific Forest Reserve became the Mount Rainier Forest Reserve, and the national park was established three years later. Despite this, there was still a movement to change the mountain's name to Tacoma and Congress was still considering a resolution to change the name as late as 1924. In the lead-up to Super Bowl XLVIII, the Washington State Senate passed a resolution on Friday, January 31, 2014, temporarily renaming the mountain Mount Seattle Seahawks until the midnight after the Super Bowl, Monday, February 3, 2014, in response to the renaming of 53 mountains in Colorado after the 53 members of the Denver Broncos by Governor of Colorado John Hickenlooper. After the 2015 restoration of the original name Denali from Mount McKinley in Alaska, debate over Mount Rainier's name intensified. Geographical setting Mount Rainier, as viewed from Kerry Park in Seattle Mount Rainier from an aircraft Mount Rainier is the tallest mountain in Washington and the Cascade Range. This peak is located just east of Eatonville and just southeast of Seattle and Tacoma. Mount Rainier is ranked third of the 128 ultra-prominent mountain peaks of the United States. Mount Rainier has a topographic prominence of , which is greater than that of K2, the world's second-tallest mountain, at . On clear days it dominates the southeastern horizon in most of the Seattle-Tacoma metropolitan area to such an extent that locals sometimes refer to it simply as \\"the Mountain\\". On days of exceptional clarity, it can also be seen from as far away as Corvallis, Oregon (at Marys Peak), and Victoria, British Columbia. With 26 major glaciers and of permanent snowfields and glaciers, Mount Rainier is the most heavily glaciated peak in the lower 48 states. The summit is topped by two volcanic craters, each more than in diameter, with the larger east crater overlapping the west crater. Geothermal heat from the volcano keeps areas of both crater rims free of snow and ice, and has formed the world's largest volcanic glacier cave network within the ice-filled craters, with nearly of passages. A small crater lake about in size and deep, the highest in North America with a surface elevation of , occupies the lowest portion of the west crater below more than of ice and is accessible only via the caves. The Carbon, Puyallup, Mowich, Nisqually, and Cowlitz Rivers begin at eponymous glaciers of Mount Rainier. The sources of the White River are Winthrop, Emmons, and Fryingpan Glaciers. The White, Carbon, and Mowich join the Puyallup River, which discharges into Commencement Bay at Tacoma; the Nisqually empties into Puget Sound east of Lacey; and the Cowlitz joins the Columbia River between Kelso and Longview. =Subsidiary peaks= Little Tahoma Peak to the left of Mt. Rainier The broad top of Mount Rainier contains three named summits. The highest is called the Columbia Crest. The second highest summit is Point Success, , at the southern edge of the summit plateau, atop the ridge known as Success Cleaver. It has a topographic prominence of about , so it is not considered a separate peak. The lowest of the three summits is Liberty Cap, , at the northwestern edge, which overlooks Liberty Ridge, the Sunset Amphitheater, and the dramatic Willis Wall. Liberty Cap has a prominence of , and so would qualify as a separate peak under most strictly prominence-based rules. A prominence cutoff of is commonly used in Washington state. High on the eastern flank of Mount Rainier is a peak known as Little Tahoma Peak, , an eroded remnant of the earlier, much higher, Mount Rainier. It has a prominence of , and it is almost never climbed in direct conjunction with Columbia Crest, so it is usually considered a separate peak. If considered separately from Mt. Rainier, Little Tahoma Peak would be the third highest mountain peak in Washington. Geology Mount Rainier Hazard map Mount Rainier is a stratovolcano in the Cascade Volcanic Arc that consists of lava flows, debris flows, and pyroclastic ejecta and flows. Its early volcanic deposits are estimated at more than 840,000 years old and are part of the Lily Formation (about 2.9 million to 840,000 years ago). The early deposits formed a \\"proto-Rainier\\" or an ancestral cone prior to the present-day cone. The present cone is more than 500,000 years old. The volcano is highly eroded, with glaciers on its slopes, and appears to be made mostly of andesite. Rainier likely once stood even higher than today at about before a major debris avalanche and the resulting Osceola Mudflow approximately 5,000 years ago. In the past, Rainier has had large debris avalanches, and has also produced enormous lahars (volcanic mudflows), due to the large amount of glacial ice present. Its lahars have reached all the way to Puget Sound, a distance of more than . Around 5,000 years ago, a large chunk of the volcano slid away and that debris avalanche helped to produce the massive Osceola Mudflow, which went all the way to the site of present-day Tacoma and south Seattle. This massive avalanche of rock and ice removed the top of Rainier, bringing its height down to around . About 530 to 550 years ago, the occurred, although this was not as large-scale as the Osceola Mudflow. After the major collapse approximately 5,000 years ago, subsequent eruptions of lava and tephra built up the modern summit cone until about as recently as 1,000 years ago. As many as 11 Holocene tephra layers have been found. =Modern activity and threat= The most recent recorded volcanic eruption was between 1820 and 1854, but many eyewitnesses reported eruptive activity in 1858, 1870, 1879, 1882, and 1894 as well. Seismic monitors have been placed in Mount Rainier National Park and on the mountain itself to monitor activity. An eruption could be deadly for all living in areas within the immediate vicinity of the volcano and an eruption would also cause trouble from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada to San Francisco, California because of the massive amounts of ash blasting out of the volcano into the atmosphere. Mount Rainier is located in an area that itself is part of the eastern rim of the Pacific Ring of Fire. This includes mountains and calderas like Mount Shasta and Lassen Peak in California, Crater Lake, Three Sisters, and Mount Hood in Oregon, Mount Saint Helens, Mount Adams, Glacier Peak, and Mount Baker in Washington, and Mount Cayley, Mount Garibaldi, Silverthrone Caldera, and Mount Meager in British Columbia. All of the above are dormant, but could return to activity, and scientists on both sides of the border gather research of the past eruptions of each in order to predict how mountains in this arc will behave and what they are capable of in the future, including Mount Rainier. Of these, only two have erupted since the beginning of the twentieth century: Lassen in 1915 and St. Helens in 1980 and 2004. However, past eruptions in this volcanic arc have multiple examples of sub-plinian eruptions or higher: Crater Lake's last eruption as Mount Mazama was large enough to cause its cone to collapse, and Mt. Rainier's closest neighbor, Mount St. Helens, produced the largest eruption in the continental United States when it erupted in 1980. Statistics place the likelihood of a major eruption in the Cascade Range at 2‚Äì3 per century. Mount Rainier is listed as a Decade Volcano, or one of the 16 volcanoes with the greatest likelihood of causing loss of life and property if eruptive activity resumes. If Mt. Rainier were to erupt as powerfully as Mount St. Helens did in its May 18, 1980 eruption, the effect would be cumulatively greater, because of the far more massive amounts of glacial ice locked on the volcano compared to Mount St. Helens, the vastly more heavily populated areas surrounding Rainier, and the simple fact that Mt Rainier is a much bigger volcano, almost twice the size of St. Helens. Lahars from Rainier pose the most risk to life and property, as many communities lie atop older lahar deposits. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), about 150,000 people live on top of old lahar deposits of Rainier. Not only is there much ice atop the volcano, the volcano is also slowly being weakened by hydrothermal activity. According to Geoff Clayton, a geologist with a Washington State Geology firm, RH2 Engineering, a repeat of the 5000-year-old Osceola Mudflow would destroy Enumclaw, Orting, Kent, Auburn, Puyallup, Sumner and all of Renton. Such a mudflow might also reach down the Duwamish estuary and destroy parts of downtown Seattle, and cause tsunami in Puget Sound and Lake Washington. Rainier is also capable of producing pyroclastic flows and expelling lava. One of many emergency evacuation route signs in case of volcanic eruption or lahar around Mt. Rainier According to K. Scott, a scientist with the USGS: > A home built in any of the probabilistically defined inundation areas on the > new maps is more likely to be damaged or destroyed by a lahar than by > fire... For example, a home built in an area that would be inundated every > 100 years, on the average, is 27 times more likely to be damaged or > destroyed by a flow than by fire. People know the danger of fire, so they > buy fire insurance and they have smoke alarms, but most people are not aware > of the risks of lahars, and few have applicable flood insurance. The volcanic risk is somewhat mitigated by lahar warning sirens and escape route signs in Pierce County. The more populous King County is also in the lahar area, but has no zoning restrictions due to volcanic hazard. More recently (since 2001) funding from the federal government for lahar protection in the area has dried up, leading local authorities in at-risk cities like Orting to fear a disaster similar to the Armero tragedy. =Seismic background= Typically, up to five earthquakes are recorded monthly near the summit. Swarms of five to ten shallow earthquakes over two or three days take place from time to time, predominantly in the region of below the summit. These earthquakes are thought to be caused by the circulation of hot fluids beneath Mount Rainier. Presumably, hot springs and steam vents within Mount Rainier National Park are generated by such fluids. Seismic swarms (not initiated with a mainshock) are common features at volcanoes, and are rarely associated with eruptive activity. Rainier has had several such swarms; there were days-long swarms in 2002, 2004, and 2007, two of which (2002 and 2004) included M 3.2 earthquakes. A 2009 swarm produced the largest number of events of any swarm at Rainier since seismic monitoring began over two decades earlier. Yet another swarm was observed in 2011. =Glaciers= Three- dimensional representation of Mount Rainier Nisqually Glacier is seen clearly from the southeast of the mountain. Glaciers are among the most conspicuous and dynamic geologic features on Mount Rainier. They erode the volcanic cone and are important sources of streamflow for several rivers, including some that provide water for hydroelectric power and irrigation. Together with perennial snow patches, the 29 named glacial features cover about of the mountain's surface in 2015 and have an estimated volume of about . Glaciers flow under the influence of gravity by the combined action of sliding over the rock on which they lie and by deformation, the gradual displacement between and within individual ice crystals. Maximum speeds occur near the surface and along the centerline of the glacier. During May 1970, Nisqually Glacier was measured moving as fast as per day. Flow rates are generally greater in summer than in winter, probably due to the presence of large quantities of meltwater at the glacier base. The size of glaciers on Mount Rainier has fluctuated significantly in the past. For example, during the last ice age, from about 25,000 to about 15,000 years ago, glaciers covered most of the area now within the boundaries of Mount Rainier National Park and extended to the perimeter of the present Puget Sound Basin. Between the 14th century and 1850, many of the glaciers on Mount Rainier advanced to their farthest extent downvalley since the last ice age. Many advances of this sort occurred worldwide during this time period known to geologists as the Little Ice Age. During the Little Ice Age, the Nisqually Glacier advanced to a position downvalley from the site of the Glacier Bridge, Tahoma and South Tahoma Glaciers merged at the base of Glacier Island, and the terminus of Emmons Glacier reached within of the White River Campground. Retreat of the Little Ice Age glaciers was slow until about 1920 when retreat became more rapid. Between the height of the Little Ice Age and 1950, Mount Rainier's glaciers lost about one-quarter of their length. Beginning in 1950 and continuing through the early 1980s, however, many of the major glaciers advanced in response to relatively cooler temperatures of the mid-century. The Carbon, Cowlitz, Emmons, and Nisqually Glaciers advanced during the late 1970s and early 1980s as a result of high snowfalls during the 1960s and 1970s. Since the early-1980s, however, many glaciers have been thinning and retreating and some advances have slowed. The glaciers on Mount Rainier can generate mudflows, through glacial outburst floods not associated with any eruption. The South Tahoma Glacier generated 30 floods in the 1980s and early 1990s, and again in August, 2015. Human history At the time of European contact, the river valleys and other areas near the mountain were inhabited by Native Americans who hunted and gathered animals and plants in Mount Rainier's forests and high elevation meadows. Modern descendants of these people are represented by members of modern tribes that surround the mountain; including the Nisqually Indian Tribe, the Cowlitz Indian Tribe, the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, the Puyallup Tribe of Indians, and the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe, among others in the area. The archaeological record of human use of the mountain dates to over 8,500 years before present (BP). Sites related to seasonal use of Mount Rainier and its landscapes are reflected in chipped stone tool remains and settings suggesting functionally varied uses including task-specific sites, rockshelters, travel stops, and long-term base camps. Their distribution on the mountain suggest primary use of subalpine meadows and low alpine habitats that provided relatively high resource abundance during the short summer season. Captain George Vancouver reached Puget Sound in early May 1792 and became the first European to see the mountain. In 1833, Dr. William Fraser Tolmie explored the area looking for medicinal plants. Hazard Stevens and P. B. Van Trump received a hero's welcome in the streets of Olympia after their successful summit climb in 1870. The first female ascent was made in 1890 by Fay Fuller, accompanied by Van Trump and three other teammates. Descending from the summit in 1883, James Longmire discovered a mineral spring; this ultimately led to his establishment of a spa and hotel, drawing other visitors to the area to seek the benefits of the spring. Later, the headquarters of the national park would be established at Longmire, until flooding caused them to be relocated to Ashford. The area also became the site of features like a museum, a post office, and a gas station, with additions like a library and a gift shop soon following; many of these buildings were ultimately nominated to the national historic register of historic places. Longmire remains the second most popular place in the park. In 1924, a publication from the park described the area: Mount Rainier sunset > \\"A feature at Longmire Springs of great interest to everyone is the group of > mineral springs in the little flat to the west of National Park Inn. There > are some forty distinct springs, a half dozen of which are easily reached > from the road. An analysis of the waters show that they all contain about > the smae [sic] mineral salts but in slightly differing proportions. All the > water is highly carbonated and would be classed as extremely \\"hard\\". Certain > springs contain larger amounts of soda, iron and sulphur, giving them a > distinct taste and color.\\" John Muir climbed Mount Rainier in 1888, and although he enjoyed the view, he conceded that it was best appreciated from below. Muir was one of many who advocated protecting the mountain. In 1893, the area was set aside as part of the Pacific Forest Reserve in order to protect its physical and economic resources, primarily timber and watersheds. Citing the need to also protect scenery and provide for public enjoyment, railroads and local businesses urged the creation of a national park in hopes of increased tourism. On March 2, 1899, President William McKinley established Mount Rainier National Park as America's fifth national park. Congress dedicated the new park \\"for the benefit and enjoyment of the people\\" and \\"... for the preservation from injury or spoliation of all timber, mineral deposits, natural curiosities, or wonders within said park, and their retention in their natural condition.\\" On 24 June 1947, Kenneth Arnold reported seeing a formation of nine unidentified flying objects over Mount Rainier. His description led to the term \\"flying saucers\\". In 1998, the United States Geological Survey began putting together the Mount Rainier Volcano Lahar Warning System to assist in the emergency evacuation of the Puyallup River valley in the event of a catastrophic debris flow. It is now run by the Pierce County Department of Emergency Management. Tacoma, at the mouth of the Puyallup, is only west of Rainier, and moderately sized towns such as Puyallup and Orting are only away, respectively. Washington state quarter Mt. Rainier appears on four distinct United States postage stamp issues. In 1934, it was the 3-cent issue in a series of National Park stamps, and was also shown on a souvenir sheet issued for a philatelic convention. The following year, in 1935, both of these were reprinted by Postmaster General James A. Farley as special issues given to officials and friends. Because of complaints by the public, \\"Farley's Follies\\" were reproduced in large numbers. The second stamp issue is easy to tell from the original because it is imperforate. Both stamps and souvenir sheets are widely available. The Washington state quarter, which was released on April 11, 2007, features Mount Rainier and a salmon. Climbing Climbers on Ingraham Glacier, above Little Tahoma Mountain climbing on Mount Rainier is difficult, involving traversing the largest glaciers in the U.S. south of Alaska. Most climbers require two to three days to reach the summit, with a success rate of approximately 50%, with weather and physical conditioning of the climbers being the most common reasons for failure. About 8,000 to 13,000 people attempt the climb each year, about 90% via routes from Camp Muir on the southeast flank, and most of the rest ascend Emmons Glacier via Camp Schurman on the northeast. Climbing teams require experience in glacier travel, self-rescue, and wilderness travel. All climbers who plan to climb above the high camps, Camp Muir and Camp Schurman, are required to purchase a Mount Rainier Climbing Pass and register for their climb. Additionally, solo climbers must fill out a solo climbing request form and receive written permission from the Superintendent before attempting to climb. =Climbing routes= Camp Muir is commonly used by those attempting to summit Mount Rainier All climbing routes on Mount Rainier require climbers to possess some level of technical climbing skill. This includes ascending and descending the mountain with the use of technical climbing equipment such as crampons, ice axes, harnesses, and ropes. Difficulty and technical challenge of climbing Mount Rainier can vary widely between climbing routes. Routes are graded in NCCS Alpine Climbing format. The normal route to the summit of Mount Rainier is the Disappointment Cleaver Route, YDS grade II-III. As climbers on this route have access to the permanently established Camp Muir, it sees the significant majority of climbing traffic on the mountain. This route is also the most common commercially guided route. The term \\"cleaver\\" is used in the context of a rock ridge that separates two glaciers. The reason for naming this cleaver a \\"disappointment\\" is unrecorded, but it is thought to be due to climbers reaching it only to recognize their inability to reach the summit. An alternative route to the Disappointment Cleaver is the Ingraham Glacier Direct Route, grade II, and is often used when the Disappointment Cleaver route cannot be climbed due to poor route conditions. The Emmons Glacier Route, grade II, is an alternative to the Disappointment Cleaver route and poses a lower technical challenge to climbers. The climbers on the route can make use of Camp Schurman (9,500 ft), a glacial camp site. Camp Schurman is equipped with a solar toilet and a ranger hut. The Liberty Ridge Route, grade IV, is a considerably more challenging and objectively dangerous route than the normal route to the summit. It runs up the center of the North Face of Mount Rainier and crosses the very active Carbon Glacier. First climbed by Ome Daiber, Arnie Campbell and Jim Burrow in 1935, it is listed as one of the Fifty Classic Climbs of North America by Steve Roper and Allen Steck. This route only accounts for approximately 2% of climbers on the mountain, but approximately 25% of its deaths. =Dangers and accidents= About two mountaineering deaths each year occur because of rock and ice fall, avalanche, falls, and hypothermia. These incidents are often associated with exposure to very high altitude, fatigue, dehydration, and/or poor weather. (58 deaths have been reported since and including the 1981 accident through 2010 per American Alpine Club Accidents in North American Mountaineering and the National Park Service.) Willi Unsoeld, who reached the summit of Mount Everest in 1963, was killed, along with an Evergreen College student, in an avalanche on Mount Rainier in 1979. He had climbed the mountain over 200 times. The worst mountaineering accident on Mount Rainier occurred in 1981, when ten clients and a guide lost their lives in an avalanche/ice fall on the Ingraham Glacier. This was the largest number of fatalities on Mount Rainier in a single incident since 32 people were killed in a 1946 plane crash on the South Tahoma Glacier. In one of the worst disasters on the mountain in over thirty years, six climbers‚Äîtwo guides, and four clients‚Äîlast heard from on May 28, 2014, were presumed dead on May 31, 2014, when low-flying search helicopters pinged the signals from the avalanche beacons worn by the climbers. Officials concluded that there was no possible chance of survival after the climbers fell 3,300 feet (1,000 m) while attempting or returning from the summit via the Liberty Ridge climbing route. Searchers found tents and clothes along with rock and ice strewn across a debris field on the Carbon Glacier at , possible evidence for a slide or avalanche in the vicinity where the team went missing, though the exact cause of the accident is unknown. The bodies of three of the client climbers were spotted on August 7, 2014, during a training flight and subsequently recovered on August 19, 2014. The bodies of the fourth client climber and two guides have not been located. Outdoor recreation In addition to climbing, hiking, backcountry skiing, photography, and camping are popular activities in the park. Hiking trails, including the Wonderland Trail‚Äîa circumnavigation of the peak, provide access to the backcountry. Popular for winter sports include snowshoeing and cross-country skiing. Climate The summit of Mount Rainier has an ice cap climate (K√∂ppen climate classification: EF) Ecology Reflection Lake is a popular place to view Mount Rainier Mount Rainier's protected status as a national park protects its primeval Cascade ecosystem, providing a stable habitat for many species in the region, including endemic flora and fauna that are unique to the area, such as the Cascade red fox and Mount Rainier lousewort. The ecosystem on the mountain is very diverse, owing to the climate found at different elevations. Scientists track the distinct species found in the forest zone, the subalpine zone, and the alpine zone. They have discovered more than one thousand species of plants and fungi. The mountain is also home to 65 species of mammals, 5 reptile, 182 bird, 14 amphibians, and 14 of native fish, in addition to an innumerable amount of invertebrates. =Flora= Subalpine wildflower meadow in Paradise region of Mount Rainier Mount Rainier has regularly been described as one the best places in the world to view wildflowers. In the subalpine region of the mountain, the snow often stays on the ground until summer begins, limiting plants to a much shorter growing season. This produces dramatic blooms in areas like Paradise. In 1924, the flowers were described by naturalist Floyd W. Schmoe: > \\"Mount Rainier National Park is perhaps better known the world over for > these wonderful flowers than for any one feature. The mountains, the > glaciers, the cascading streams and the forests may be equalled if one looks > far away enough, but no park has been so favored in the way of wild > flowers.\\" Forests on the mountain span from as young as 100 years old to sections of old growth forest that are calculated to be 1000 years or more in age. The lower elevation consists mainly of western red-cedar, Douglas fir, and western hemlock. Pacific silver fir, western white pine, Alaska yellow cedar, and noble fir are found further up the mountain. In the alpine level, Alaskan yellow cedar, subalpine fir, and mountain hemlock grow. =Fauna= A Cascade red fox active during Paradise's long winter The mountain supports a wide variety of animal life, including several species that are protected on the state or federal level, like the Northern Spotted Owl. Efforts are also being made to reintroduce native species that had locally been hunted to extinction, like the Pacific fisher. There are sixty-five types of mammals living on the mountain, including cougars, mountain goats, marmots, and elk. Common reptiles and amphibians include garter snakes, frogs, and salamanders. There are many types of birds found throughout the different elevations on the mountain, but while some live there all year, many are migratory. Salmon and trout species use the rivers formed by the glaciers, and though the lakes stopped being stocked in 1972, thirty lakes still have reproducing populations.

In 2009, the City of Winnipeg sold the parkade to the owners of the Commodity Exchange and Winnipeg Square for $23.6 million. The sale involved $400,000 in real-estate fees paid to Shindico, the Winnipeg firm that brokered the deal. It has been estimated that 16,000 people pass through Winnipeg Square each weekday. Next to Winnipeg Square was the prairie regional headquarters of Scotiabank, at 200 Portage Ave., a five-storey building that opened on September 13, 1979. Scotiabank has since moved their headquarters to the more modern True North Square at 225 Hargrave St., while maintaining a branch at 200 Portage Ave. featuring a more prominent street entrance (under construction). As part of the 42-storey 300 Main apartment complex construction, Winnipeg Square is getting a makeover. A pair of escalators were constructed. A GoodLife fitness gym is being constructed at 330 Main that will open in 2020.

Early life Ward was born in New York City into an old New England family and was the eldest of seven children. His father, Samuel Ward III, was a highly respected banker with the firm of Prime, Ward & King. His grandfather, Col. Samuel Ward, Jr. (1756‚Äî1832), was a veteran of the Revolutionary War. Sam's mother, Julia Rush Cutler, was related to Francis Marion, the \\"Swamp Fox\\" of the American Revolution. When Ward's mother died while he was a student at the Round Hill School in Northampton, Massachusetts, his father became morbidly obsessed with his children's moral, spiritual, and physical health. It wasn't until he was a student at Columbia College, where he joined the Philolexian Society and from which he graduated in 1831, that he began to learn about the wider world. The more he learned, the less he wanted to become a banker. He convinced his father first to let him study in Europe. He stayed for four years, mastering several languages, enjoying high society, earning a doctorate degree from the University of T√ºbingen, and, in Heidelberg, meeting Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, who became his friend for life. Career He returned to New York, married Emily Astor, the eldest daughter of businessman William Backhouse Astor, Sr., in January 1838 and tried to settle into the life of a young banker. His father died unexpectedly in November 1839. Next, Ward's brother Henry died suddenly of typhoid fever. In February 1841, his wife gave birth to a son, but within days both she and the newborn died. Ward was executor of his father's several-million-dollar estate, partner now in a prestigious banking firm, guardian of his three sisters, a widower, father of a toddler, and 27 years old. He remarried in 1843, and urged on by his new wife, Ward began speculating on Wall Street. In September 1847, the financial world was stunned by news that Prime, Ward and Co. (King had wisely withdrawn) had collapsed. =California gold rush= Broke, Ward joined the '49ers rushing to California. He opened a store on the San Francisco waterfront; plowed his profits into real estate; claimed he made a quarter of a million dollars in three months; and lost it all when fire destroyed his wharves and warehouses. For a time he operated a ferry in the California wilderness; he alluded to mysterious schemes in Mexico and South America; and he bobbed up in New York a wealthy man again. He plunged back into speculating and lost all of his money again, and with it went Medora's affection. This time he finagled a berth on a diplomatic mission to Paraguay. When he sailed home in 1859, he brought with him a secret agreement with the president of Paraguay to lobby on that country's behalf and headed to Washington, DC, to begin a new career. =Washington, D.C.= Ward was a Democrat with many friends and family in the South. He also believed in gradual emancipation, which put him at odds with his sister, Julia Ward, who would later write \\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic,\\" and her husband, Samuel Gridley Howe. But there was no question that he would remain loyal to the Union. He put his dinner table at the disposal of his neighbor Secretary of State William Henry Seward. His elegant meals, which had already begun to be noticed, provided the perfect cover for Northerners and Southerners looking for neutral ground. In the early days of the war, Ward also traveled through the Confederacy with British journalist William Howard Russell, secretly sending letters full of military details back to Seward for which he surely would have been hanged or shot if exposed. In 1862, he told Seward he was wrong to think that the Confederacy would have rejoined the Union had war been averted: \\"I differ from you. I found among the leaders a malignant bitterness and contemptuous hatred of the North which rendered this lesson necessary. within two years they would have formed entangling free trade and free navigation treaties with Europe, and have become a military power hostile to us.\\"Nevins, Allan. The War for the Union, vol. 1, The Improvised War, 1861-1862 (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1959), p. 53. At the war's end, Ward's friends in high places, his savoir faire, his trove of anecdotes and recipes, and his talents for diplomacy augured well for his success in Washington, where the coals were hot and ready for an era of unprecedented growth and corruption that became known as \\"the Great Barbeque\\" or \\"The Gilded Age.\\" His entr√©e into the Johnson administration was Secretary of the Treasury Hugh McCulloch, who, faced with the colossal task of financial reconstruction, turned for help to Ward , who won for him a partial victory via cookery. Soon he was boasting to Julia that he was lobbying for insurance companies, telegraph companies, steamship lines, railroad lines, banking interests, mining interests, manufacturers, investors, and individuals with claims. Everyone, he crowed, wanted him. What they wanted was a seat at his famous table. His plan de campagne for lobbying often began with p√¢t√© de campagne, with a client footing the bill. Sam took great care in composing the menu and guest list for his lobby dinners. If his client's interests were financial, members of the appropriate House and Senate committees received invitations. Mining and mineral rights? That was another group of players. He also orchestrated the talk around the table and used stories from his variegated life like condiments at his dinners. The results? \\"Ambrosial nights,\\" gushed one guest. \\"The climax of civilization,\\" another enthused. But how did these delightful evenings serve his clients' ends? Subtly, and therein lies what set Sam Ward apart as a lobbyist. He claimed, and guests agreed, that he never talked directly about a \\"project\\" over dinner. Instead, he let a good food, wine, and company educate and convince, launch schemes or nip them in the bud. At these evenings new friendships developed, old ones were cemented, and Sam's list of men upon whom he could call lengthened. This was the hallmark of what reporters labeled the \\"social lobby,\\" and, by the late 1860s, Sam was hailed in newspapers across the country as its \\"King.\\" And yet nowhere in this age of corruption and scandal‚Äînot in the press, in congressional testimony, or in his own letters or those of his clients‚Äîwas there any hint that \\"the King\\" ever offered a bribe, engaged in blackmail, or used any other such methods to win his ends. =Later life= By the late 1870s, the \\"King of the Lobby\\" was slowing down. Although friends urged him to retire, the truth was that he couldn't. Sam was famous, but he was not rich. He lived well‚Äîvery well indeed‚Äîbut on other men's money. But then his luck changed once again. Years earlier, a wealthy Californian, James Keene, had been a poor, desperately ill teenager in the California gold fields and Sam had nursed him back to health. Keene never forgot his kindness. He manipulated railroad stock with his good \\"SAMaritan\\" in mind, and, when he came East in 1878, he gave Sam the profits‚Äînearly $750,000. With this dramatic change in his circumstances, the \\"King\\" abdicated his crown, decamped for New York, and naively backed unscrupulous strangers developing a grand new resort on Long Island. To no one's surprise but Sam's, the project failed and Sam's final fortune evaporated. In order to evade creditors, Sam sailed for England. He bobbed up in London and was straightaway entertained by his many friends there and then moved on to Italy. During Lent in 1884, he became ill near Naples. On the morning of May 19, he dictated one last lighthearted letter and died. Personal life Ann Hall, Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Ward (Emily Astor), 1837. Miniature on ivory, 5 1/2 x 4 1/2 in. Private collection, Barrytown, New York In January 1838, he married Emily Astor, eldest daughter of businessman William Backhouse Astor, Sr. and Margaret Rebecca Armstrong of the Livingston family. In November 1838, Emily gave birth to their daughter, Margaret Astor Ward, who married John Winthrop Chanler, son of John White Chanler and Elizabeth Shirreff Winthrop. Together, they had ten children, including William Astor Chanler, Sr., Lewis Stuyvesant Chanler, and Robert Winthrop Chanler. In February 1841, Emily gave birth to a son, but within days both she and the newborn died. Sam was executor of his father's several-million-dollar estate, partner now in a prestigious banking firm, guardian of his three sisters, a widower, father of a toddler, and 27 years old. In 1843, Sam married Marie Angeline \\"Medora\\" Grymes. Before their marriage, Medora had been \\"engaged to a young, handsome and rich Frenchman, bearing a title, though a member of a wealthy house in Paris, of which he was the representative in New York.\\" Reportedly, Ward wooed her, convincing her to end her engagement and marry him. Medora, \\"the daughter of the celebrated lawyer, John R. Grymes of New Orleans,\\" was considered \\"the most brilliant woman of her age that America has ever produced\\". After bearing Ward two sons in quick succession, she went to Europe with their two sons for their education. She became prominent at court, and \\"was an especial favorite with both Napoleon III and Eug√©nie.\\" =Legacy= Within days of his passing, obituaries appeared in dozens of newspapers in the United States and England. The New York Times' obituary filled two entire columns. The New York Tribune correctly concluded that Sam Ward's \\"greatest achievement was establishing himself in Washington at the head of a profession which, from the lowest depths of disrepute, he raised almost to the dignity of a gentlemanly business....He never resorted to vulgar bribery; he excelled rather in composing the enmities and cementing the rickety friendships which play so large a part in political affairs, and he tempted men not with the purse, but with banquets, graced by vivacious company, and the conversation of wits and people of the world.\\" Sam's book of poetry, Lyrical Recreations, soon sank into obscurity. His hilarious anonymous magazine accounts of his stint in the gold fields were edited into a volume entitled Sam Ward in the Gold Rush in 1949. For years after his death, bar patrons ordered \\"Sam Wards,\\" a drink he invented of cracked ice, a peel of lemon, and yellow Chartreuse. Restaurants carried Chicken Saute Sam Ward on their menus for decades. Locke-Ober in Boston served for years a dish called Mushrooms Sam Ward. He was immortalized by his nephew author Francis Marion Crawford as the delightful Mr. Bellingham in Dr. Claudius. And Sam's name has been kept alive by scholars speculating upon the identity of the anonymous author of \\"The Diary of a Public Man,\\" published in 1879. The social lobby that Sam Ward perfected also lives on. Although entertaining by lobbyists has been circumscribed by legislation, it endures because, as Sam understood, bringing people together over good food, wine, and conversation remains a fruitful way to conduct business. As Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. noted 100 years after Sam's death, \\".....every close student of Washington knows half the essential business of government is still transacted in the evening.....where the sternest purpose lurks under the highest frivolity.\\" Sam Ward's art was to guarantee that the guests who enjoyed his ambrosial nights never focused on the purpose that lurked beneath his perfectly cooked poisson.

During this era, they were the most powerful of the rural clans in Palestine's central highlands.Doumani, 1995, p. 31 History The Jarrar clan migrated to Marj Ibn Amer (Jezreel Valley) in the Lajjun district from the Balqa region of Transjordan in 1670. They became an economic power and gained control over what would become Sanjak Jenin in the early 19th century.Doumani, 1995, p. 37 The area was known for its grain, tobacco and cotton production. It also marked the border between Galilee and Jabal Nablus, linked the coast to the interior and contained the market town of Jenin, which also served as a storage for collected taxes from the district. The Jarrars' political power was punctuated by their peasant militia and their heavily fortified, hilltop throne village of Sanur. Sanur was built by a branch of the Jarrar family, that moved there from nearby Jaba',Macalister and Masterman, 1905, p. 356 which was another fortified village of the Jarrars.Sch√∂lch, 1993, p. 183. In the 18th century, the Jarrar clan was at the forefront of various conflicts between the governors of Acre and the rural clans and urban notables of Jabal Nablus. Acre was a rising power and as its successive governors attempted to expand their zone of influence, they entered into conflict with the Jarrar clan because of the proximity of Marj Ibn Amer to Acre. The first serious battle occurred in 1735 with Sheikh Zahir al-Umar over control over Nazareth, a principal center of trade in the interior between Jabal Nablus and the Levantine regions north of it. The town had for decades paid taxes to the Jarrar clan, but Zahir al-Umar attempted to covet it. His forces defeated the Jarrar clan and the latter's leader, Sheikh Ibrahim Jarrar, was slain.Doumani, 1995, pp. 41-2. As the Nablus-based Tuqan clan expanded its control over parts of the city's rural hinterland, primarily through their seizure of the Bani Sa'b subdistrict from the Jayyusi clan in 1766, the Jarrars attempted to halt the process of urban control over the hinterland. To pressure the Tuqans, they allowed Zahir al-Umar to pass through their territory without resistance and besiege Nablus in 1771 and 1773. The circumstances of these events placed the Tuqans and the Nimr clan as the defenders of Ottoman sovereignty and the Jarrars as the backers of rebels, namely Zahir al-Umar and the resurgent Mamluks of Egypt under Ali Bey Al-Kabir.Doumani, 1995, pp. 43-4 Following Zahir al-Umar's death, Jezzar Pasha succeeded him as governor and unlike his predecessor, he developed close relations with the Ottoman government, eventually being entrusted with the governorship of Sidon Province and Damascus Province. He also cultivated close ties with the Tuqans. The Jarrars meanwhile resisted Jezzar's efforts to centralize control over Palestine. As a result, their fortress at Sanur was twice besieged by Jezzar's troops in 1790 and 1795, both ending unsuccessfully for Jezzar. Between 1817 and 1823, a civil war occurred in the Jabal Nablus region, with the Jarrars and the Qasim clan of the Jamma'in subdistrict leading the front against the Tuqan clan, which had the support of the Ottoman government. The Tuqans hired outside mercenaries to aid them, stationing them in the village of Junayd, just west of Nablus. This move by the Tuqans fostered further resentment against them by the inhabitants of the area and helped the Jarrars in their war efforts. They defeated the Tuqans and the latter's leader Musa Bey Tuqan was killed by poison on 20 November 1823. In 1830, the Jarrars refused to submit to Governor Abdullah Pasha of Acre's authority after he was apportioned the Jabal Nablus district. Consequently, Abdullah Pasha, with reinforcements from Emir Chehab of Mount Lebanon, besieged the Jarrars' throne village of Sanur, storming it four months later.Philip, 2004, p. 20 The Jarrars' fortress was destroyed and their influence took a heavy blow. A year later, forces dispatched by rebel leader Muhammad Ali of Egypt conquered the Levant and ended Abdullah Pasha's reign. Ali's son Ibrahim Pasha was appointed governor of the Levant. He favored the Abd al-Hadi clan based in Arraba as a counterweight to the Jarrars. They subsequently replaced the Jarrars as the leaders of the Sha'rawiyah subdistrict.Doumani, 1995, p. 46 The influence of the Jarrar clan was significantly reduced by the mid-19th century.Doumani, 1995, p. 172 In 1848, the Jarrar clan split into two separate factions.Doumani, 1995, p. 148 One of these factions aligned with the clan's former rivals, the Tuqans, to aid the Ottoman authorities in crushing the Abd al-Hadi family's power in Jabal Nablus. They participated in the assault on the Abd al-Hadi's throne village of Arraba, looting it and destroying the village's defenses and the Abd al-Hadi family's fortified houses.Doumani, 1995, pp. 234-5 Part of the clan moved to the port city of Haifa in the 1870s. There they established trade relationships with foreign merchants and began an export company. Having been members of the elite in Jenin, their entry into Haifa's upper class was relatively easy. The main family member in Haifa was Tawfiq al-Jarrar, who was known as Salil al-Akabir (Son of the Great). In 1892, he served as the head of Haifa's trade and agriculture offices, being re-elected in 1900. At that time, he also was a member of Haifa's municipal council, the board of education and the transportation committee. Two years later, he was president of Agricultural Bank's Haifa branch.Yazbak, 1998, pp. 150-151.

The Firm's main business concerns were in fur trading, wholesaling provisions, local real estate, being an acting agent for the East India Company's Canadian agent, and serving as the financial repository for the receiver-general's Department of Lower Canada. On the 12 of December, 1827, Anderson married Ann Richardson‚Äîshe was the widow of David Ogden and the oldest daughter of John Richardson: John Richardson was the senior partner at Forsyth, Richardson and Company. Anderson's marriage to Richardson's daughter undoubtedly helped in any nepotistic opportunities for him with the firm; Anderson ended up becoming Forsyth, Richardson and Company's last president. Anderson and his wife produced one daughter, Elizabeth Magdalene Anderson; she grew up to marry Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph Bell Forsyth. In 1847, Forsyth, Richardson and Company faced a calamity of which it would not recover: The firm had a massive capital pull-out from its shareholders. Anderson, as President of the firm, lead the company through its eventual dissolution of its co-partnership with Forsyth, Walker and Company. With the dissolution finished, the new firm reorganized and renamed the Montreal company Anderson, Auldjo and Company, with Anderson as a senior partner. Anderson's other partners‚ÄîLouis Auldjo, William Evans, and Thomas Forsyth‚Äîwere also clerks at the old firm; Forsyth, Richardson and Company. In 1852, Louis Auldjo departed from the company to start his own, the result left another reorganization and renaming of the firm; Anderson, Evans and Company, hardware merchants and importers. In 1858, There was another reorganization and renaming of the firm due to new additional partners: Samuel and Thomas Evans. The new firm's name was Anderson, Evans and Evans from that point until 1861 when the partnership had finally dissolved in which Anderson decided to dedicate the rest of his work in banking. From 1830 to 1834, Anderson had served as a director in the Bank of Montreal; this again, was understood to be a position procured by being the son-in-law of one of the more important founders and shareholders of the Bank of Montreal. He re-engaged himself as a director of the Bank of Montreal in the very next year, in 1835, until his retirement in 1869. In 1837, there was an exchange crisis in Canada: Anderson was an active member of the director's committee in deciding policy for the Bank of Montreal during the exchange crisis. In 1840, Anderson vehemently supported the expansion of the banks operations into Upper Canada, move that was captained by the then president of the Bank of Montreal, Peter McGill. In 1841, Anderson represented the Bank of Montreal before Canada's Legislative Assembly's committee on Money and Banking. Anderson presented arguments for new legislation that would allow and support for more branch banking to be accessible in Canada. On June 8, 1847, Anderson had succeeded in taking over the vice president‚Äîfrom Joseph Masson‚Äîchair for the Bank of Montreal. On June 5, 1860, after Peter McGill's retirement, Anderson was unanimously voted to take over McGill's position, President of the Bank of Montreal. During Anderson's presidency at the Bank of Montreal, he readily transitioned the bank to adapt to the economic and political environments that had evolved in Canada. Economically, Canada‚Äîwhen Anderson first arrived‚Äîwas certainly a more mercantile type of system, by the time he became President of the bank, the Canadian economy was definitely functioning in a more sophisticated and corporate system. Anderson was looked at as \\"one of the old race of Canadian Merchants\\"; he proved during his presidency, when he reorganized the Bank to fit the new corporate system, that he wasn't sentimentally attached to being a part of the \\"old race of Canadian Merchants\\". On April 17, 1855, Anderson served as chairman on the board of directors representing Canada for Liverpool, London Fire and Life Insurance Company; He would continue to serve as chairman of this board until he was removed on July 20, 1872. He after being removed as chairman of the board of directors for Liverpool, London Fire and Life he continued to serve as a member of the board until his death. This experience led him to open opportunities up for the Bank of Montreal: As President he allowed branch bank Managers to offer insurance products and other corporate interests. In 1862, Anderson had created the position of \\"General Manager\\" for the Bank of Montreal and chose a Scottish banker, that was known for being clever, named David Davidson. after Davidson had retired, it took Anderson one year to find another General Manager. He found one in a young Irish banker named Edwin H. King. King would prove to be shrewd, competent, and skillful as the General Manager for the Bank of Montreal, he would also later succeed Anderson as the 7th president of the Bank of Montreal and be called and remembered as \\"The King of Canadian Bankers\\". The decision to create a General Manager position for the bank and the two people Anderson chose to fill it proved that his confidence in the General Manager position was a brilliant move. During the American Civil War, the Bank of Montreal was able to profit greatly from their southern neighbor's situation. With King's knowledge of the American money market, the Union's constant need for more financial credit, plus the bank's ready access to English gold, Anderson was able to lead the Bank to exploit the war to its advantage. In November 1863, Under Anderson's leadership, The Bank of Montreal was able to acquire the account for the Government of Canada from a rival bank, The Bank of Upper Canada‚Äîwhich was in a severe decline. Although the account would prove to be skeptical in financial upside due to the many monetary commitments and obligations the government had, Anderson and the bank readily used the clout and influence that came with being the managers for the financial account of their country's government. In 1866, The Bank of Montreal had used their new political prowess‚Äîthat it gained from acquiring the Canadian Government as a client‚Äîto promote and pass a piece of legislation. The legislative piece made it so banks could take government debentures and species and convert them into provincial notes; a law that was purely advantageous to banks whom dealt with government accounts. Given that the Government's banker‚Äîin this case the Bank of Montreal‚Äîhad the most to gain from this new law, the bank's rivals were adamantly against it. Despite the heavy opposition, the law had still passed due to the Bank of Montreal's governmental position. In 1867, the first Prime Minister of Canada, John Alexander MacDonald was convinced by Edwin King to not assist the collapsing Commercial Bank of the Midland District; in contrary to the advice given him from Alexander Tilloch Galt, his Minister of Finance. The Bank of the Midland District was the Bank of Montreal's top rival after the fall of the Bank of Upper Canada. The consequences of this choice by the Prime Minister led to the inevitable failure of the Bank of the Midland District; the failure of one of the most substantial and powerful institutions in the country. During Anderson's presidency at the Bank of Montreal he was remembered for being pessimistic and overly cautious, however during the years of him being the leader, the bank had thrived and greatly increased its overall position in the country and the world over. In just nine years, deposits to the bank had tripled; this is mainly contributed to the flight of American assets and capital to Canada during the American civil war. Gold, silver, and coin holdings had increased with the addition of government debentures making the institution more stable than ever before. On October 20, 1869, Anderson retired as the Bank of Montreal's President and from the company for good. This was mainly due to reasons of deteriorating health; he had developed a speech impediment that is suspected to be a result of a slight stroke. The Bank of Montreal's Board of Directors voted to award Anderson a stipend of $2000 for all the good faith that he displayed over the years of service to the Bank. His retirement would result in a rather idle lifestyle; he was expected to be very politically active after his career. Anderson's retirement was occupied by political endeavors; he was very interested in British politics and remained a devoted \\"Tory\\". Strangely enough, Anderson was rather inactive in the local and provincial politics in Canada: Being a prominent Canadian merchant. This was looked at as bizarre that he would be more interested in the politics that were happening \\"across the pond\\" (Great Britain) rather than being interested in the political environment that he was living in. On April 2, 1838, Anderson was appointed to the Special Council for Lower Canada by the then Governor of Lower Canada, the Earl of Gosford Acheson. Anderson would only hold this position for a season, until June 1, 1838. In 1849, Anderson had joined the Annexation Association, became one of the eight Vice-President of the association and eventually was one of the signers of the Annexation Manifesto. Along with his political aspirations and vocations, Anderson had also supported a number of charities, civil services, education, and religious organizations. In 1829, Anderson had joined in an executive position for the newly organized Montreal Committee of Trade; In 1842, the organization became the Montreal Board of Trade. Although Anderson was never President of the Montreal Board of Trade, In 1849, he was voted to be the Vice-President of the Board of Trade; From 1842 to 1850, Anderson served on the Board of Trade's executive council and the board of arbitration. Anderson was the acting treasure for the Montreal General Hospital, an institution that John Richardson, his father-in-law, had contributed to greatly and frequently. Anderson also supported the Longueuil Mission. His wife Ann was an active supporter and participant of multiple organizations and charitable works, such as: the Lying-in Hospital Society and the Ladies Benevolent Society. In 1832, Ann Anderson's mother had reorganized these charitable societies. Although Anderson was of strict Anglican faith, he had a reserved pew at Montreal's St. Gabriel Street Church; a Presbyterian church. The reserved pew at St. Gabriel was more of a social inclination rather than a spiritual one; most Scottish merchants in Montreal attended the very same church, so it is easy to discern that Anderson's regular attendance at St. Gabriel was a status issue. Anderson also attended his proper Anglican obligations, he still went to his Anglican church, the Christ Church Cathedral congregation in Montreal and later the St. James the Apostle congregation. Anderson was an active member and worker of the diocese and his parish. In 1856, Anderson became a part of a committee of 11 to draw up plans and construct the new Christ Church Cathedral. In addition, he had also performed as the fiduciary secretary for the Parochial Endowment Fund; he had invested some of the funds money into the Bank of Montreal, buying some of its public shares. Starting on May 2, 1845, Anderson served on and was a member of the Board of Governors for McGill University until his death. During his time with McGill University he had donated generously to facilities and served on multiple committees that concerned the University's affairs. In the years 1851 and 1852, Anderson served as the Vice-Chairman of the Board of Governors at McGill University, and right after serving as the Vice-Chairman he became the first member of the Finance Committee for the University.

From Oxford, Grahame Donald was selected in 1914 to play for Scotland, who he represented as a prop against Wales on 7 February, and Ireland on 28 February. His participation in the First World War and subsequent career in the military ended his international rugby career. Military career Donald also became famous for his miraculous escape from death having fallen from his Sopwith Camel at in 1917. On a summer's afternoon he attempted a new manoeuvre in his Sopwith Camel and flew the machine up and over, and as he reached the top of his loop, hanging upside down, his safety belt snapped and he fell out. He was not wearing a parachute as a matter of policy. Incredibly, the Camel had continued its loop downwards, and Donald landed on its top wing. He grabbed it with both hands, hooked one foot into the cockpit and wrestled himself back in, struggled to take control, and executed \\"an unusually good landing\\". In an interview given 55 years later he explained, \\"The first 2,000 feet passed very quickly and terra firma looked damnably 'firma'.

Alcoa owns three of the four generating stations, which were placed into service in the early 1960s. The largest unit, known as Unit 4, is 323-MWe unit jointly owned by Alcoa and Vectren. This larger unit was placed in operation in 1970. Fuel The Power Plant is generally fueled by Illinois Basin coal that is mined from the nearby region. The generating station receives about 2 million tons of coal each year from both rail and truck shipments. Environmental impact Warrick Plant discharges all of its waste heat (about twice its electrical output) into Ohio River. In 2006, Warrick Plant was the third most-polluting major power station in the US in terms of sulphur dioxide gas emission rate: it discharged of SO2 for each MWh of electric power produced that year (92,919 tons of SO2 per year in total). In light of the high emissions and increasing regulation, Alcoa commenced a large scale $400 million environmental investment to improve emission levels. In December 2008, the project was complete and included wet-flue gas desulphurization equipment (also known as scrubbers). This control equipment significantly reduced sulfur dioxide emissions beyond those required by regulation. Vectren also contributed to the upgrades on its share of Unit 4. The environmental control system also included gypsum dewatering and handling facilities, dry-ash handling, new coal handling equipment and improved control facilities. With the control systems fully operational and online in 2009, the plant saw more than a 95 percent reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions and other compounds.

Early life  Aschner was born in Vienna, into a secular socialist family with Jewish origins. Her father Gustav R√∂mer was an engineer who served as an officer in the army of the Austrian monarchy during World War I. Aschner's parents were both active members of the Austrian Socialist Party, and raised both Ilse and her brother in humanist ideals. Aschner attended University of Vienna, studying German literature and psychology (including under professor Charlotte B√ºhler). Until March 1938 she did not know that she was Jewish according to the \\"N√ºrnberg Race Laws\\", passed by the Nazis because she was a baptised Christian though she did not go to church.  Holocaust  In 1938, when the Nazis took power in Austria, Aschner was forced to leave the university. She emigrated in 1939 to Britain, where she worked as a maid in Amotherby a small town in Yorkshire, and later trained in nursing and worked in a kindergarten in Manchester. Her family, except for her brother, who also left Austria, were all killed during the Holocaust. She met her future husband Peter Aschner in the Young Austrian Movement in the early 1940s. He was the son of a textile-factory owner and became a communist during the second world war.  Post-war career  In 1946 Aschner returned to Austria with her husband, Peter Aschner (1918‚Äì1984). She had become a convinced communist and worked for several years as a journalist for the Austrian Communist Party's own newspaper. After the end of the Prague Spring in 1968 Aschner lost her belief in \\"socialism with a human face\\", and along with many Austrian intellectuals left the party. From 1969 to 1978 she worked for the Austrian monthly magazine FORVM, which had been founded by Friedrich Torberg and was at that time run by G√ºnther Nenning. After leaving FORVM she became chief secretary of the Grazer Autoren Versammlung, Austria's largest writers' union, where she worked with Ernst Jandl and Josef Haslinger. In 1989 she retired, and has since performed in Vienna's first reading theatre. Since 2006 she has had only a few readings, but remains one of the most interviewed witnesses of the shoah in Austria. She lived as a widow in Vienna and has a daughter, a son, two granddaughters, and one great-grandson.

The story follows protagonist Matthew Fuller, a physics research assistant at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as he accidentally creates a machine that can jump ahead in time. Fuller travels to the year 2252 where he finds society has been decimated by war and become a theocracy based on the Second Coming of Jesus which occurred 71 years ago, and to the year 4346 where he finds society is ruled by an artificial intelligence. Fuller is joined by Martha from 2252 and La from 4346 traveling further into the future until they meet other time travelers who are able to send them back in time. The novel explores themes of societal and individual susceptibility to forms of autocracy. The novel was a finalist for a Nebula Award and a Locus Award. Background American science fiction author Joe Haldeman was 64-years old at the time of publication of The Accidental Time Machine. His best known work was The Forever War series in which two of the novels had won both the Hugo and Nebula awards. His most recent novels were Camouflage and Old Twentieth had been published in 2004 and 2005, respectively, with Camouflage winning the Nebula Award for Best Novel. During this time Haldeman also worked as an adjunct professor teaching writing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where The Accidental Time Machine is partially set. Plot summary The protagonist, Matthew Fuller, is a research assistant for physics professor Jonathan Marsh at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in 2058, when he builds a calibrator to supply one photon per unit of time. When he presses the reset button, the box unexpectedly disappears for one second. When he presses the button a second time, he finds it disappears for about 10 seconds. The third time, it disappears for a bit less than three minutes. Fuller deduces it is traveling forward in time at intervals approximately 11.8 times the previous interval and he further deduces how to bring other objects, such as himself, along. On the seventh press of the button, Fuller and the box are taken 39 days into the future and unexpectedly land on a busy road. He is arrested on suspicion of murder but is bailed out of jail by an anonymous person he comes to believe is himself from the future. He continues forward, 465 days, then 15 years, when he is greeted by Professor Marsh who tracked Fuller and calculated the theoretical physics behind time travel. Unsatisfied, Matt travels to 2252 where he learns that the Second Coming of Jesus has occurred and resulted in the One Year War. Society is now governed by a theocracy led by Jesus and shuns technology. Jesus had anticipated Fuller's appearance at the Massachusetts Institute of Theosophy, where he is appointed to be professor with a female student named Martha assigned to be his assistant. As Fuller tries to scientifically rationalize Jesus's seeming omnipotence, Jesus orders Fuller to destroy the time machine but he instead flees, along with Martha, and lands in the year 4346 outside of California. There they find a society where all of humanity is wealthy and satisfied to a point of apathy. It is here that they encounter an artificial intelligence, named La, that controls Los Angeles. La is curious about her own mortality, and having learned about Matt's time machine from historical records, wishes to join him on a journey to the end of time (heat death of the universe) to discover if she can die. Matt and Martha begin to receive messages in their dreams from beings that appear to Matt as future versions of himself and to Martha as Jesus. He/they warn Matt and Martha of La's willingness to sacrifice their lives in pursuit of her goal, and advises them to stall for time to allow them to catch up. Matt and Martha, accompanied by La in a spacecraft, begin to travel further into the future, discovering evermore unfamiliar species of life, including androgynous evolutions of humanity and a race of intelligent bears. Time travelers are not always welcome - some future societies having been devastated by diseases brought from the past by such travelers for which future humans had no immunity, and therefore regard them as a dangerous threat. After a confrontation where they narrowly avoid being killed by La, they meet the people who have been sending them subliminal messages. These beings tell Matt and Martha that the future becomes ever more alien and unpleasant, and offer to send two back in time, while allowing La to continue jumping forward in time. The beings can specify either the exact time or the exact location to which Matt and Martha will be sent, but not both (this limitation is similar to the uncertainty principle). Concerned about the couple possibly materializing in the middle of the ocean or inside of a mountain, they opt to be specific about location and send them to MIT. When they arrive, they find that it is the late 19th century, and the main MIT campus in Cambridge has not yet been built. Having no other option, they live in this society, where Matt studies and teaches physics, aided significantly by his advanced knowledge both of physics and historical events. However, he takes care not to change history - for example, he does not anticipate Albert Einstein in \\"discovering\\" Relativity Theory, as he could have easily done; rather, he takes care to appear a talented but not outstanding professor. Matt and Martha have several children, and the end of the book reveals that Professor Marsh (Matt's MIT professor in the mid-21st century) is actually Matt's descendant. =Timeline and list of societies= * February 2, 2058: Matt's first time jump - 39 days. Appears in the middle of the street, still in Boston, Massachusetts. * May 15, 2059: 465 days later. Appears on a busy highway. * 2074: 15 years later. Matt appears on a field in a stadium named the \\"Matthew Fuller Sports Centre\\". The society is similar to 2058 but with advances in science and technology and new cultural trends, like facial scarring. * 2252: 177 years later. Matt appears near the New Hampshire border in a theocratic society ruled by a being who claims to be Jesus. The inhabitants shun technology and the study of history before the One Year War which they believe was fought between believers and non-believers of Jesus following his Second Coming. They refer to the year as 71. * 4346: 2094 years later. Matt and Martha arrive near California in a society governed by an artificial intelligence named La. There appears to be no poverty or illness and the inhabitants live by the rules of bartering focused on material wealth. * 24,000 years later. Martha, La, and Matt land in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Indonesia and travel to Australia and America. They are greeted by a hologram which does not allow them contact with society due to its experience with disease transmitted by other time-travelers. They otherwise encounter bioengineered dinosaurs and bear-like people. * 320,000 years later. There appears to be no life on Earth and they travel to the moon. They only encounter large, hostile mechanical creatures. * 3.5 million years later. They meet six other time-travelers who send Martha and Matt to the past and La to the future. * 1898. Martha and Matt arrive back in Boston. Style and themes Like other fiction that depicts time travel, The Accidental Time Machine is a cautionary story. The novel illustrates the susceptibility of people to autocracy. The protagonist, Fuller, acts suspicious of the Jesus figure that appears to control society in 2252. After he seeks to escape the theocracy, he unquestioningly submits to the equally autocratic artificial intelligence, La, who controls society in 4346. Fuller is described as scientist and an atheist which makes him more susceptible to accepting a scientifically controlled society and suspicious of a theocracy. Upon suspecting that La intends to abandon or betray him, and finding himself in ever more inhospitable and alien environments, Matt again unquestioningly follows the instructions of the voices he hears in his dreams, like Martha does but in her case because she believes them to be from Jesus. The story was compared to H. G. Wells's The Time Machine for its warnings of theocratic hoaxers and the danger of complacency. The Accidental Time Machine was compared and contrasted to Haldeman's earlier works in The Forever War series which similarly followed a protagonist traveling to future times. However, in The Forever War, the story is told from the perspective of a soldier experiencing time dilation, and the focus is on social systems, rather than an academic purposefully choosing to go forward, and the focal theme was on political and economic systems. Publication and reception The Accidental Time Machine was released in the United States on August 7, 2007, as a hardcover published by Ace Books, the science fiction imprint of Berkley Books of the Penguin Group. The paperback and ebook versions were released a year later on July 29, 2008. An audiobook, narrated by Kevin Free, was published by Recorded Books in September 2008. The book was nominated for the 2008 Nebula Award for Best Novel, and the 2008 Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel. The novel was characterized as \\"fun and compulsively readable\\" and thoughtful. The reviewer in the Magill Book Reviews found the \\"High points include Haldeman's deft sketches of an intriguingly changed world at various periods, the relationship between Martha and Matt, and the satisfying choice to return them from the alien, entropic far-future to a place and period that offers comforts and rewards.\\" However, reviewers also noted an uneven pace with a slow beginning and \\"frenetic final series of chapters\\". Reviewer Karen Burnham, in Strange Horizons wrote: \\"In the end, I think this book might have been better served by cutting to the chase earlier, excising a large section of the first third, and losing Martha's romantic education. Then it could have been published as a novella instead of a novel.\\"  See also  * Flight to Forever * The Late Philip J.

In April 2011, he was told to retire by the Japan Sumo Association after he and several other wrestlers were found to be involved in match-fixing. He currently resides in Los Angeles and participates in sumo exhibitions and amateur tournaments. Career Yamamotoyama won several local, national and world sumo championships before entering Nihon University in 2003. He won a total of five championships at Nihon University. He then entered professional sumo as a member of the Onoe stable. He broke the record for the largest new recruit, weighing in at 233 kg in 2007. The previous record holder, Hokutomori, weighed in at 205 kg when he joined professional sumo in 1994. His shikona or fighting name was created simply by adding the suffix yama (meaning \\"mountain\\") to his own surname. This is common for lower ranked wrestlers but it was rather unusual him to keep it even after reaching sekitori status. Yamamotoyama however, shares his name with a well-known producer of Japanese seaweed and tea, with whom he was reportedly keen to secure a sponsorship deal. Yamamotoyama in May 2009 Yamamotoyama rose quickly through the ranks, recording only one make-koshi before reaching the second division of j≈´ry≈ç at the 2008 September tournament. Upon his promotion he posed for photographers with two bags of rice and told reporters that he was aiming for 241 kg in weight, to break the record for a Japanese rikishi then held by Susanoumi. Only two wrestlers have weighed more than him: Hawaiian born Konishiki at , and Russian sandanme rikishi Orora at . Yamamotoyama once reportedly ate 146 pieces of sushi in a single meal. After posting nine wins in consecutive j≈´ry≈ç tournaments, he was promoted to the top makuuchi division for the 2009 January tournament. The twelve tournaments it took him to enter the top division ties him with Tochiazuma, among others, in a group of the second fastest wrestlers to reach this level. He came through with a kachi- koshi winning record of 8-7 in his debut makuuchi tournament, and followed up with another 8-7 in March 2009. He failed to get his kachi-koshi on the final day of the May 2009 tournament, for only the second time in his career. He suffered a muscle pull in his ribcage during the July 2009 tournament after falling to the floor of the dohyo twice in two bouts against Wakakoyu on Day 9 and had to withdraw for the first time in his career. He fell to the j≈´ry≈ç division for the September tournament as a result. He scored 9-6 there, enough for an immediate makuuchi return. However he entered the Kyushu basho in November 2009 in poor condition, having injured his right elbow whilst on tour in October, and he eventually withdrew from the tournament with only two wins, after being diagnosed with influenza. Remaining in the j≈´ry≈ç division, he suffered knee ligament damage on the 11th day of the July 2010 tournament and was forced to withdraw. Still troubled by the injury, he pulled out on the first day of the September tournament, and as a result was demoted to the makushita division. Following his loss of sekitori status, he resumed menial duties at Onoe stable, becoming the head chanko chef. Due to his injury he was unable to do any keiko (training) except walking. After fighting only one bout from the rank of Makushita 13, he withdrew from the November tournament as well. His continuing absence saw him drop to the fourth sandanme division for the (cancelled) March 2011 basho. Retirement In April 2011, along with 18 other wrestlers, he was ordered to retire by the Japan Sumo Association (JSA) after an investigation into allegations of bout-rigging prompted by the discovery of text messages on the mobile phone of fellow juryo wrestler Kasuganishiki, which mentioned Yamamotoyama's involvement in throwing matches. He responded angrily to the decision, saying \\"The JSA made up its mind from the start that I cheated without listening to me.\\" However, on April 5 he visited the Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan to hand in his retirement papers, alongside stablemates Sakaizawa and Shirononami who were also found guilty. He had a retirement ceremony at the Tokyo Prince Hotel in September 2011, alongside Sakaizawa. Post-retirement activities Yamamotoyama lifting Indian actress Sunny Leone on the set of Bigg Boss. In 2012 he appeared in Season 5 of India's biggest reality show Bigg Boss. Before entering he told reporters that he had already seen the 4th season and he that he loved both the show and Indian culture, despite not knowing Hindi or English. He was given special placards with pictoral representations that helped him to communicate his needs to the housemates. To ensure that Yamamotoyama remains entertained, special activities had been planned during his stay in the house that helped audiences to get some special insights into the life of a professional Japanese sumo wrestler. He entered the house on day 91, as a guest, and bid a farewell after a day of stay there. In their last week Yamamotoyama would teach origami to Bigg Boss 5 inmates. In 2013 Yamamotoyama participated in a multi-city \\"Sumo + Sushi\\" show tour in the United States, co-sponsored by Living Social and USA Sumo. Attendees were shown sumo training exercises and then actual (albeit somewhat restrained) bouts between Yamamotoyama and other sumo stars such Ulambayaryn Byambajav and Kelly Gneiting. In May 2015, he appeared on the American television program The Bachelorette along with Ulambayaryn, and in 2017 starred in the music video for the song \\"Shape of You\\" by English artist Ed Sheeran. Also in 2017 he was featured in the Hollywood motion picture John Wick 2 with Keanu Reeves. Fighting style Yamamotoyama's most common winning kimarite or technique was yori-kiri, the force out, and he preferred a migi-yotsu, or left hand outside, right hand inside grip on his opponent's mawashi. He also regularly won by oshi-dashi, the push out, and uwatenage, the overarm throw.

The Organization for Jewish Colonization in Russia (, ), commonly known by its transliterated acronym of ICOR, was a Communist-sponsored mass organization in North America devoted to supporting the settlement of Jews in new collective settlements, firstly in the newly established Ukrainian Soviet Republic and Southern Russia (Stavropol Krai), and latterly in the Jewish socialist republic of Birobidzhan in the Soviet Union. The organization was founded in the United States in 1924 and soon spread to Canada. In 1934 the original ICOR organization was supplemented by a new fundraising and solidarity organization, the American Committee for the Settlement of Jews in Birobidjan (Ambidjan). The two groups merged into a unified organization in 1946. Organizational history=Establishment= The founding meeting was held in New York City in December 1924 and the initial mission of the organization was to raise money to fund Jewish collective farms in Crimea and to provide a humanitarian alternative for Jews facing anti-Semitism in Europe. ICOR was motivated by the situation of the Jews of Eastern Europe who had faced decades of pogroms and turmoil (including almost a decade of war) in the Pale of Settlement and constant threat of anti- Semitism in their countries of refuge in Central and Western Europe. Alternatively, the relative safety and welcome in the New World yielded what many saw as a trend towards the dissipation of Jewish culture, language, and \\"nationality\\".Ch. 2, 3. Gessen, Masha (2016). \\"Where the Jews Aren't: The Sad and Absurd Story of Birobidzhan, Russia's Jewish Autonomous Region\\". New York, NY: Schocken Books. Originally, the committee worked in partnership with its American contributors and Soviet authorities in order to support the newly founded large Jewish collective farms in the former Pale of Settlement, notably Southern Ukraine and the Crimea. These \\"kolkhozes\\" (collective farms) attracted many former shtetl Jews from Ukraine and Belorussia who had previously fled to larger cities for safety, as well as those whose livelihoods had been disrupted in the requisitions and economic restructuring of the early period of Soviet consolidation. When, in 1928, the Soviet Union abandoned the idea of Jewish settlement in Crimea and endorsed instead the eventual formation of a Jewish Autonomous Republic in the eastern USSR, ICOR followed suit. ICOR worked closely with the Komzet, the Soviet agency facilitating Jewish settlement, and its partner, the OZET. One of ICOR's initial patrons was Julius Rosenwald, president of Sears, Roebuck and Company who contributed more than $2 million to ICOR.Oakton Community College, \\"Biro- Bidjan and American Support,\\" A Gift to Biro-Bidjan: Chicago, 1937: From Despair to New Hope. oakton.edu/ Retrieved October 16, 2010. Rosenwald and many other prominent and wealthy American Jews contributed to ICOR's efforts, and their contributions were supplemented by those of working and middle class readers of the Yiddish press in the United States that carried appeals for funding and support. =Expansion= Yiddish was regarded as the national language of the Jewish people by the Soviet Union and some American ICOR literature was published in bilingual English and Yiddish editions. The Canadian wing became a separate organization in 1935. The ICOR was active among first and second generation Yiddish-speaking Jewish immigrants and was intended as a rival to the Zionist movement and its agitation for a Jewish homeland in Palestine. In the 1930s the organization was also involved in protests against Nazi Germany and encouraged a boycott of German goods and also fundraised for the International Brigades fighting in the Spanish Civil War. ICOR was associated with the Communist Party, USA and the Communist Party of Canada and generally followed the Comintern's party line. The organization declined following the signing of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact. =Ambidjan= The American Committee for the Settlement of Jews in Birobidjan (Ambidjan) was established on February 27, 1934, at a meeting held in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in New York City.Henry Felix Srebrnik, Dreams of Nationhood: American Jewish Communists and the Soviet Birobidzhan Project, 1924-1951. Brighton, MA: Academic Studies Press, 2010; pg. 33. The meeting was addressed by Lord Marley, Dudley Leigh Aman, a British Labour Party Member of Parliament and leading spokesman for the Birobidzhan project in the United Kingdom. The chief American behind the establishment of the new organization was William W. Cohen, a banker and stockbroker who had been a Congressman from New York's 17th Congressional District from 1926 to 1928. Cohen saw the establishment of a Jewish Autonomous Region in the USSR as providing an important \\"haven for the salvage and rehabilitation of many thousands of Jews suffering in the infernos of central and eastern Europe\\" and supported the establishment of Ambidjan with his money, time, and effort. Ambidjan began formal operations in September 1935 with the establishment of an office located at 285 Madison Avenue in New York City. Lord Marley was named honorary president with Cohen the president of the organization. A key figure behind the scenes at Ambidjan was Jacob M. Budish, a member of the Communist Party USA and employee of Amtorg, the New York-based Soviet foreign trade office in the United States.Srebrnik, Dreams of Nationhood, pg. 36. Budish's close ties with Soviet Ambassador Alexander Troyanovsky and position in the Communist Party apparatus made him the ideal conduit for information to Ambidjan regarding developments in the Soviet Union. In the summer of 1935 Budish travelled to Birobidzhan to tour the region and conduct talks with government officials regarding the future role of Ambidjan.Srebrnik, Dreams of Nationhood, pg. 37. Following Budish's 1935 talks, Soviet authorities gave Ambidjan permission to proceed with its efforts to subsidize the emigration of European Jews to Birobidzhan. Selection of settlers, primarily from Poland, Lithuania, Romania, and Germany, was to be made by Ambidjan in consultation with Soviet officials. Ambidjan would provide a grant of $350 per family selected to aid in the costs of relocation. Ambidjan's efforts attracted a wide spectrum of Americans to membership in its ranks, including a substantial contingent from the middle and upper classes, some of whom were non-Jews.Srebrnik, Dreams of Nationhood, pg. 34. Dues in the organization cost $5. In 1946 ICOR and Ambijan merged to form a unified organization. =Dissolution= The organization was unable to withstand the anti-Communism of the McCarthy era; moreover, the creation of Israel in 1948 greatly increased the attractiveness of Zionism as offering an alternative for \\"Jewish Colonization\\". The organization was dissolved in 1951.

She researched apes and led scientific expeditions to the Dutch East Indies. Early life Selenka was born as Margarethe Heinemann, a merchants daughter. In 1886 she married the writer Ferdinand Neub√ºrger, but the marriage ended in a divorce a few of years later. In 1893 she married again with Emil Selenka, a professor in zoology at the University of Erlangen, who was the widower of her sister. Under Selenka's influence she began to study palaeontology, anthropology and zoology and became his assistant. In 1892 she participated in a scientific expedition to Ceylon, Japan, China and the Dutch East Indies led by her husband. When Emil Selenka became severely ill during their stay in the Dutch East Indies and had to return to Germany, she continued the work, spending some months exploring the jungles of Borneo to study apes. Back in Germany the couple wrote a report on their journeys titled Sonnige Welten: Ostasiatische Reiseskizzen (Sunny worlds: East Asian travel sketches). Feminism The Selenkas moved to Munich in 1895. Here Margarethe would eventually become professor at the Ludwig Maximilian University. She befriended the feminists Anita Augspurg and Lida Gustava Heymann and became involved in the German feminist-pacifist movement, that associated domestic violence against women with the tendency in countries to go to war. Together with Augspurg, who was Germany's first female professional lawyer, Selenka campaigned for women's suffrage and legal gender equality in the German empire. She became a member of the Verband fortschrittlicher Frauenvereine (VfFV), Germany's feminist organization that was considered radical at the time. Selenka was also a pacifist, who believed future wars could be prevented by dialogue and the establishment of international laws. In 1899 she was the main organizer of an international pacifist demonstration. Anthropological work Meanwhile, the scientific work of the Selenkas continued. They were intrigued by Eug√®ne Dubois' discovery of Java man fossils (Homo erectus) at Trinil in 1891. Dubois claimed to have discovered the evolutionary \\"missing link\\" between apes and humans. However, not all scientists agreed and the debate was made difficult by Dubois' refusal to show others his fossils. Emil Selenka decided to organize an expedition to Java to find more evidence. However, he died in 1902, leaving the task to his wife. Margarethe Selenka continued the work and the expedition took place in 1907-1908. It was unsuccessful in discovering more Java man fossils at Trinil, but it did make a thorough contribution to the regional stratigraphy and many fossils of Pleistocene mammals were found. The report was supervised by Selenka and the geologist Max Blanckenhorn and was internationally praised for its accuracy. Many of the positive reactions came from opponents of Dubois' ideas, like the British anatomist Arthur Keith, who saw the report as prove against Dubois. In the late 20th century, the report has been cited by creationists because it states that a human molar was found during the excavations at Trinil. Creationists see this as proof that modern humans lived at the same time as Java men, thus excluding the possibility that Java man can be a direct ancestor for humans. This is based on a misunderstanding since Homo erectus is today by anthropologists seen as human itself. Peace conference In 1904, Selenka represented the VfFV at the international peace conference in Boston. After a dispute with Augspurg and Heymann she left the VfFV and joined the rival Bund f√ºr Mutterschutz und Sexualreform (BfMS), which was founded by her friend Helene St√∂cker. In 1915 she participated in an international peace conference at The Hague, initiated by czar Nicholas II in an effort to stop the First World War. Like other pacifist activists, Selenka was placed under house arrest by the German government.

It was put into an orbit of about . Its mission was to monitor the oceans for naval and merchant vessels, and had a mission life of about eleven months. Description Kosmos 1867 was launched on July 10, 1987 on a Tsyklon-2 rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome. It was put into an orbit about above the Earth's surface at an inclination of 65¬∞ and a period of 100.8 minutes. The satellite had a mission life of about 11 months. The satellite was powered by TOPAZ 1 nuclear reactor. This reactor was cooled by liquid sodium-potassium (NaK) metal, and used a high-temperature moderator containing hydrogen and highly enriched fuel. The reactor produced electricity using a thermionic converter. The satellite used a Plazma-2 SPT Hall-effect thruster from propulsion. The mission of Kosmos 1867 was to search the oceans for naval and merchant vessels. Unlike earlier Soviet RORSAT satellites, Kosmos 1867 and its twin, Kosmos 1818, were launched into high orbits. This reduced the likelihood of mishaps resulting in uncontrolled re-entry of radioactive material, as had occurred with Kosmos 954 and Kosmos 1402, which showered the Earth with radioactive debris. , Kosmos 1867 has a visual magnitude of approximately 3.3. Kosmos 1867 has become damaged, resulting in several fragments of space debris. It is suspected that the coolant tube has leaked NaK metal, in a manner similar to Kosmos 1818 in 2008. On April 8, 2014 the US Space Surveillance Network reported that 11 new objects were detected, and 24 more objects ware reported on April 15, 2014. The coolant tube of Kosmos 1867 may have cracked due to thermal stresses by repeated solar heating, or by an impact.

The 40977 hectares (101,256 acres) of land is currently owned by the Federal Government. Within its boundaries, the so-called \\"Military Block\\" contains Drummond (Island) Lake, Fish Lake, Callanan Lake, as well as innumerable other small lakes. It also contains the Volcanic Neck, Danil îaz (known by settlers as \\"The Dome\\"), and parts of Beecher Prairie. History Known today as the Chilcotin Military Training Area, the land once was used extensively by both the Tlesqox-t'in of the Tsilhqot'in Nation (Anglicized as Chilcotin), and possibly also the Setlemuk, AKA Canyon Shuswap. Many historic village sites of Quiggly hole as well as countless other archaeological sites have been located within the area. After the smallpox epidemic of 1862, almost all the Canyon Shuswap people died, and survivors joined with today's Alkali Lake band (Esketemc). After the threat of a third intentional introduction of smallpox to the region, T≈ùilhqot'in Chief Lhat≈ù'a≈ù îin began the Chilcotin War in 1864 to make it known to all settlers and other First Nations that the homelands of the T≈ùilhqot'in were off-limits, and all outsiders were removed. This included the area known today as the Chilcotin Military Training Area. While the T≈ùilhqot'in recovered from population decimation, the lands were used less than previous countless generations of indigenous people. This changed in the mid 20th Century when First Nations leaders established at Fish Lake (AKA \\"Chilcotin Forest\\") an interdisciplinary cultural centre and field school, where youth and others were taught traditional hunting and gathering practices, net making, hide tanning, etc. A revival of T≈ùilhqot'in language also took place at Fish Lake. However, the lands were acquired by the Canadian Federal Government with questionable consent from those using the land, and today all that remains of the cultural centre are decrepit building foundations and overgrown driveways. Hunters are encouraged to exercise extreme caution when in the area. In 2017, the Military Block was heavily affected by wildfire - as was the majority of the Chilcotin Plateau.

Development The first Wilkinsons motorcycle was built by the Wilkinson Sword company, which had diversified from making blades into a number of new products, including bicycles, typewriters and automobiles, as well as luxury motorcycles. The first 'Wilkinsons' were originally designed for military reconnaissance by P G Tacchi, who was granted a patent for the design in 1908. Demonstrated to the British military in the Summer of 1908, the Wilkinson motorcycle failed to impress the authorities, despite optional accessories including a Maxim machine gun mounted on the handlebars. Undaunted, the company continued development and exhibited a new version a year later at the Stanley Cycle & Motorcycle Show at the Agricultural Hall, Islington, London in 1909. This model had a 676 cc four-cylinder engine and was designated the 'TAC' (for 'Touring Auto Cycle'. An upgraded version of the military model was also exhibited, with a revolver holster fitted to the side of the seat. The unsuccessful military prototype was originally powered by an air-cooled transverse V-twin, but a new engine was developed at their Oakley works in Chiswick for the luxury production Wilkinson in December 1911. This was a water-cooled 848 cc with a large radiator at the front. An in-line four- cylinder side-valve, it had a bore and stroke of 60 x 75 mm. Redesignated the 'TMC' (for \\"Touring Motor Cycle\\"), the Wilkinson TMC was one of the top of the range motorcycles built before the First World War. It had no front brake, so relied on twin drum rear brakes which were pedal operated. The brazed lug tubular frame was fully sprung with quarter elliptic rear springs and 'girder' front forks with horizontal springs compressed through bell crank levers. Wilkinson had also diversified into light car production by this time and designed a substantial enclosed sidecar with leaf spring suspension as an option for the TMC. In 1912 the 'worm drive' rear hub was replaced with more effective bevel gearing and the Wilkinson designed girder forks were upgraded to a 'Saxon' design to improve handling. Only about 250 Wilkinsons were produced before the First World War restrictions brought the line to its end in the Spring of 1916 and the Wilkinson company had to produce thousands of bayonets for the war effort. After the war they decided to continue to develop the in-line four engine - but in a new car called the 'Deemster' and they never returned to motorcycle production. A 1912 Wilkinson was featured in action on the BBC TV programme Top Gear on 14 April 1988 as part of the Feet First feature written and presented by Paul Blezard. Malcolm Newell and his Quasar and Royce Creasey and his prototype Voyager were also featured.

The biggest accomplishment of the Los Angeles Art Organ Company during its very short lifespan was the creation of the lavish instrument that was on display in Festival Hall at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. The instrument was the largest in the world at the time of its construction and contained more than 10,000 pipes. The organ, even though it wasn't completed on time and was only partially functional during the first weeks of the fair (due in large part to the enormous financial burden the construction was placing on the firm), was played by some of the most famous virtuosos of the time. Most notably is probably Felix Alexandre Guilmant (see Alexandre Guilmant) who played a series of 40 concerts in a six-week period. The organ was extremely well received and the Los Angeles Art Organ Company was awarded a gold medal from the World's Fair for its construction.

He was the fourth player drafted from the small college when the Green Bay Packers selected him in the sixth round of the 1974 NFL Draft. He was used sparingly during his rookie season, but in Week 2 of 1975 he had 167 receiving yards on a then-franchise-record 12 receptions. The record was tied, but not broken until 2016 by Davante Adams. He led the Packers in receptions and receiving yards for the next two seasons. However, he was cut by the Packers after just four games in 1977. The Philadelphia Eagles claimed him off waivers on October 17th, but he had an emergency appendectomy just two days later and missed the rest of the season.

Museo de Historia natural de Valparaiso, Chile A tembet√° (Guaran√≠ language: temb√©: lip, Ita: stone.) or barbote (Argentina) is a metal or stone rod placed in lower lip piercings by members of some indigenous peoples in South America. It has been used since the Neolithic period by different human groups for body modification, spiritual protection, and indication of sexual maturity.  Pre- Columbian use  According to the first studies of Jorge Fern√°ndez, tembet√°s originated in Planalto, Brazil. Their use expanded as far south as El Quisco, Chile, and they were adopted by indigenous groups such as the Guarani, Tupi, and Chiriguano peoples.\\"Los aritos eran gritos de guerra en las comunidades ind√≠genas.\\" Sociedad Rio Negro. 20 Jan 2002. Retrieved 17 March 2012.  Sociological importance  The tembet√° played a part in initiation ceremonies, signifying the entry of young men into adult life. After these ceremonies, the men could marry and acquire the responsibilities of an adult male.  Corporal use and skill of placement  The tembet√° is a male adornment in the lower lip. Several men and candidates would meet and drink chicha, a fermented beverage made from maize, to dull the pain. A specialist would perforate the lip with a thick wooden needle. The tembet√° would be inserted, and the person would wear it for the remainder of his life. Participants would ask during the ceremony that the tembet√° protect its owner from death. To this end, it was placed near the mouth, a potential entry of damaging forces. Indeed, it was a very important amulet, more than an adornment. Molle culture used the adornment, made of rock, preferably of beautiful colors. It consists of a thin curved plate molded to the gums. In the centre was a button, either cylindrical or sharply-pointed, that penetrated the lip 5 to 7 cm.  Geographical distribution  The tembet√° is a cultural feature of very wide distribution. It has been used by peoples of Africa, Asia, and the Americas and often it had, apart from it decorative value, a social meaning. Another variant was a pipe of stone, often talc, in the shape of letter \\"T\\". These pipe-shaped tembet√°s could be used in rites to smoke herbs with hallucinogenic properties. = Guarani people = The tembet√°, called \\"labrete\\",The Indigenous Manufacture Across Some Objects Of The Collections Of The Museum was used by the tribes of the Guarani. According to archaeological findings, the Guarani tembet√° was made of quartz in the shape of a \\"T\\", 10 cm in length. The working of the quartz was done by a shaman. Quartz correlates to ita-ver√° (brilliant stone) of the mythical one Tup√° Overas√∫, and of the great one Tup√° of the Storm. = In Chile = The tembet√° was used in several pre-Columbian cultures in Chile. The principal one was the Molle culture, which brought the tembet√° from the Planalto of Brazil. Cultures derived from the Molle were the Diaguita, Llolleo, and Bato. In the Llolleo culture the tembet√° was of cardinal importance, but among the Bato, it was more on the level of a personal adornment, without any spiritual connotations.  Social differentiation  The tembet√° offers protection against the negative action of the \\"owners of the nature\\"; it is the ritual adornment of the \\"souls that travel towards the land of beyond\\". Many neolithic tribes of the Amazon demonstrated a deep scorn for peoples that did not use the tembet√°.

It is one of ten short plays that make up Tonight at 8.30, a cycle written to be performed in groups of three plays across three evenings. The original production, starring Coward and Gertrude Lawrence played in a pre-London tour, and then the West End, and finally New York, in 1935‚Äì1937. Family Album has been revived periodically and has been adapted for television. The play depicts a prosperous middle-class Victorian family gathered after the funeral of their father. It emerges that he was a man of bad character, who wanted to deprive his children of their inheritance, but they have the last laugh. Background In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Coward wrote a succession of hits, ranging from the operetta Bitter Sweet (1929) and the epic Cavalcade (1931), requiring a large cast, gargantuan sets and a complex hydraulic stage, to the intimate comedies Private Lives (1930), in which Coward starred alongside Gertrude Lawrence, and Design for Living (1932).Hoare, p. 249 Coward said that after Private Lives, he felt that the public enjoyed seeing him and Lawrence together on stage, and so he wrote the play cycle Tonight at 8.30 as \\"acting, singing, and dancing vehicles for Gertrude Lawrence and myself\\".Hoare, pp. 268‚Äì270 In the programme for the London run Coward wrote: All the plays in the cycle starred Coward and Gertrude Lawrence. Coward directed the plays and wrote the words and music for songs in four of them. In this play, billed as \\"a Victorian comedy with music\\" there are four songs.Mander and Mitchenson, p. 295 They are \\"Drinking Song\\" (\\"Here's a toast to each of us\\"); \\"Princes and Princesses\\"; \\"Music Box\\", and \\"Hearts and Flowers\\".Coward (1965), pp. 174‚Äì179 First performances Six of the ten plays in Tonight at 8.30 were first presented at the Manchester Opera House beginning in October 1935.The Manchester Guardian, 16 October 1935, p. 11 They did not include Family Album, which was added later in the pre-London tour and first performed at the Theatre Royal, Birmingham, on 9 December 1935.Mander and Mitchenson, p. 282 Tonight at 8.30 opened in London on 9 January 1936 at the Phoenix Theatre,\\"Phoenix Theatre\\", The Times, 10 January 1936, p. 10 In the first programme of three plays, Family Album was the first item, followed by The Astonished Heart and Red Peppers.Parker, p. 21 When King George V died eleven days after the opening of the run, a comedy about a funeral was thought inappropriate and Family Album was replaced in the triple bill by We Were Dancing during the following four weeks. After a try-out in Boston, the Broadway opening took place on 24 November 1936 at the National Theatre, again starring Coward and Lawrence. Family Album was the final item in the third triple bill, which it shared with Ways and Means and Still Life.Mander and Mitchenson, p. 283 Original cast *Jasper Featherways ‚Äì No√´l Coward *Jane Featherways ‚Äì Gertrude Lawrence *Lavinia Featherways ‚Äì Everley Gregg (Joyce Carey in New York) *Richard Featherways ‚Äì Edward Underdown *Charles Winter ‚Äì Anthony Pelissier *Harriet Winter ‚Äì Alison Leggatt (Joan Swinstead in New York) *Edward Valance ‚Äì Kenneth Carten *Emily Valance ‚Äì Moya Nugent *Burrows, the butler ‚Äì Alan Webb Plot The play is set in autumn 1860 in the drawing room of the Featherways family's house in Kent. The family, all dressed in mourning, have returned from the funeral of the paterfamilias. The group comprises his five children, Jasper, Lavinia, Richard, Harriet and Emily with, except for the unmarried Lavinia and RIchard, their spouses. Warmed by glasses of madeira poured by their much-loved old butler, Burrows, they reminisce. An old toybox is produced, as is an old musical box; old songs are remembered and more glasses of wine are drunk. Suddenly Lavinia, her reticence overcome by wine, denounces the old man: \\"I hated Papa, so did you ‚Ä¶ He was cruel to Mama, he was unkind to us, he was profligate and pompous and worse still, he was mean\\".Coward (2014), p. 239 She then astonishes the others by telling them that the will read to them that morning, leaving the Featherways fortune to the family, was not the old man's final will: a week before he died he made a new one, leaving them nothing but giving large sums to his various mistresses and the rest to pay for a new church containing a grandiose memorial to himself. It was witnessed by Lavinia and Burrows. Minutes after the old man's death they burned it, leaving the old will to be acted upon. Questioned by Jasper, Burrows says his deafness is getting worse and he will never be able to hear questions about the will. They invite him to join them for a glass of madeira, and, to the tune of the musical box, they dance round him, hand in hand.Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 307‚Äì308 Revivals and adaptations Family Album has been revived in complete or part-complete cycles of Tonight at 8.30. In a 1948 American tour, directed by the author, Lawrence appeared again as Jane, with Graham Payn as Jasper.Mander and Mitchenson, p. 323 A West End revival in 1970 featured Millicent Martin and Gary Bond as Jane and Jasper.Mander and Mitchenson, p. 325 The play was included in productions of Tonight at 8.30, the Williamstown Theatre Festival in 2000, the Chichester Festival in 2006, the Antaeus Company in Los Angeles in 2007, the Shaw Festival in 2009, and the Jermyn Street Theatre, London in 2018.Brantley, Ben. \\"How to Savor Fleeting Joys: Smiles Suave, Brows Arched\\", The New York Times, 28 June 2000,Belcher, David. \\"Brushing Up Their Coward in Canada\\".

All six of these highways provide routes either to the border at Mexico or deep into the southern USA. Between Williston and Minot, US 2 provides several high points where one can view graceful and beautiful landscape for many miles in all directions. Between Minot and Grand Forks, US 2 provides an ever-changing mix of agricultural farm and pasture land, native wetlands, and small lakes set on a gently rolling landscape. US 2 also passes near a large lake named Devils Lake near the city with the same name. Throughout the state, the route generally travels east and west following the northern BNSF railroad route which is also used by Amtrak. The US 2 route through North Dakota was originally named the Wonderland Trail or the Teddy Roosevelt Trail. In Rugby, just east of the route's intersection with North Dakota Highway 3 (ND 3), the highway passes the location designated in 1931 as the geographical center of North America. The monument marking the geographic center had to be relocated in 1971 when US 2 was converted from two lanes to four lanes.

Early life and education  Born and raised in Chicago, Coughlin served two years of combat during World War II. He then earned a bachelor's degree in liberal arts from Northwestern University in 1952.  Professional career  Coughlin's first job was working for a small radio station in Alton, Illinois, where he lived in a dingy boarding house with the station's other disc jockeys. After about a year in Alton, Coughlin worked for a variety of radio stations in Chicago. He joined WBBM-TV in 1953, working mostly on children's programs. In 1969, Coughlin was pressed into service as a weatherman after one of the station's meteorologists, Roy Allred, took ill just before a broadcast. Later, after Allred quit, Coughlin was asked to become the station's interim meteorologist, even though by his own admission, he knew nothing about the subject. No replacement ever was found, however, and after eight months of filling in, Coughlin was given the job on a full-time basis. Coughlin then began studying meteorology‚Äîeven hiring a tutor from the University of Chicago. In July 1976, WBBM demoted Coughlin, who by that point was the station's top weather forecaster, to be a staff announcer and replaced him with part-time actor Tom Alderman, who also had been a public relations professional for then-Illinois Gov. Dan Walker. The station received more than 10,000 letters of protest from viewers, and eventually restored Coughlin in February 1977 to his previous job and apologized on the air. Coughlin retired from WBBM-TV in August 1989. \\"I cannot think of a thing that I would have done differently,\\" Coughlin told the Chicago Tribune at the time of his retirement. \\"I've been so lucky. I was at the right place at the right time several times in my life. I had no idea I'd be the weatherman when I started out.\\"  Death  Coughlin collapsed and died at his retirement home in Evanston, Illinois on February 17, 2001.  Personal  Coughlin never married.

Developed by General Motors, IBM was brought in as a partner in 1960 and the two developed the system and released it to production in 1963. It was publicly unveiled at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in Detroit 1964. GM used the DAC system, continually modified, into the 1970s when it was succeeded by CADANCE. History=Genesis= GM was an early computer user, using punched card machines as early as 1952 for engineering analysis. In 1955 they moved their computing services into the new Data Processing department of GM Research Laboratories. In 1956, together with North American Aviation, they developed the first \\"official\\" batch processing operating system for IBM systems, GM-NAA I/O. In 1958 they were one of the earliest users of IBM's new FORTRAN compiler.Origin, pg. 41 In June 1958 GM Research started a program to better understand the problems and potential improvements in the industrial design process. The team found that each step of the process -from initial conception and body styling through engineering design and finally to detailed parts drawings- used different types of diagrams. Each division within the company had to have their own drawing departments to support them. Time was being lost, and errors introduced, when the diagrams moved from one department to another and had to be re-drawn into the local format. Even the task of looking up the diagrams in the engineering libraries represented a significant amount of time. When modifications were made to drawings, this process repeated itself. Convinced that automation was a solution to at least some of these problems, in 1959 Donald Hart tasked the Data Processing department of GM Research to start developing a system to store diagrams for rapid retrieval and simple modifications.Origin, pg. 42 The idea was that the diagrams would be digitized into the computer, displayed interactively to allow rotations, scaling and projections, and then printed on demand. Lookups would be handled via punched card queries, which would allow operators to quickly retrieve documents for manipulation into whatever local format the user needed, and then print it. Repetitive queries could be automated simply by saving the card stack. =Prototype= The Data Processing department had already been experimenting with an IBM 704 computer displaying points on the IBM 780 display which were recorded to 8 mm film. One early use was plotting traffic simulations. However, the displays were not based on storage tubes, so the images disappeared shortly after they were drawn. In order to keep the image on the screen, the program had to be put into a loop, continually refreshing the display. While this was happening the computer could not be used for other tasks. Although it was suitable for demonstration purposes, a real-world system would need additional hardware to offload this task from the CPU. Another problem was printing the diagrams. GM solved this problem by using an approach developed by Boeing, replacing the milling head of a computerized milling machine with a ball-point pen and connecting the inputs of the mill to the 704 computer. To address the extremely limited amount of memory available on the 704, they broke the diagrams down into 32-by-32-inch squares, which could be plotted with enough accuracy that they could be loaded up as separate tiles and still line up perfectly when plotted as part of complete diagrams. A set of rollers were added to allow the plotter to move a single piece of paper around the drawing surface on demand, meaning that the paper did not have to be cut into pieces. The paper was delivered in rolls, allowing diagrams to be any length. The final problem was to convert the existing diagrams, on paper, into computer data. The solution was to re- print the diagrams onto clear acetate and place them in front of the 780 display. The computer then moved the display's dot across the screen, where it would be periodically occluded by the lines on the acetate. A photomultiplier tube noticed these drops in output and recorded them. Since diagrams consist largely of whitespace and a few lines, a simple raster scan would be too time consuming. Instead, when the program noticed a line it would scan a circle of points around the last hit, attempting to find the line again. The system allowed the digitizing of 6,000 points a second.Origin, pg. 43 The output was a set of cubic polynomials that described the line smoothly. =DAC-1= The system, known as Digital Design, was demonstrated and improved throughout 1959. In order to avoid confusion over the term \\"digital\\", which at that time was most closely associated with fingers and not computing, the name changed to DAC-1. By the summer it was clear the basic idea was feasible. In August, the team was given the go-ahead to start work with IBM to purchase an IBM 7090 computer and develop commercial versions of the display hardware. The production system had to not only manipulate existing drawings, but also be capable of modifying them in the computer. Although the computer would not normally be used to produce new artwork, once the diagrams were scanned into the system, changes could be made without going through the entire scanning process again. Once digitized, additional software could be used to convert the lines into a 3D shape. This was groundbreaking research at the time, and generated a flurry of research papers.Interpolating, 1968 Once converted, the diagrams could be output into the APT numerical control language for direct output on milling machines. This would allow a design team to sketch out their ideas, put them into the system and clean them up, and then have the milling systems produce a physical model. =IBM partnership= In July 1960 IBM presented GM with a formal development contract for a \\"Graphic Expression Machine\\", or \\"Project GEM\\".Origin, pg. 44 The system was hosted by the 7090, IBM's then-standard large business offering, partnered with two new channel controllers for the yet-to-be-released IBM 1301 hard disk system, and a custom controller to drive multiple graphical terminals. Output from the terminals could be sent to a plotter, 35 mm slide film.Origin, pg. 53 IBM estimated the system would be installed within 18 months after signing the contract. GM accepted the offer in November 1960.Origin, pg. 45 Development took longer than expected. While the 7090 was being installed at GM Research in Warren, MI, the GM teams were given use of one of IBM's own 7090s in Kingston, NY. As the original production date grew closer the number of GM employees traveling to NY became a serious budget problem, which was addressed when GM rented a Convair aircraft for ferry flights between the two sites. A more serious problem was the scanner system, and a joint GM-IBM team was able to finally address the issues.Origin, pg. 46 The system was given a full demonstration run at IBM's Kingston site in December 1962. The demonstrations were so well attended that bleachers were set up so that all of the attendees could see the terminal screen. The high usage demands during the demos eventually led to the disk system crashing. The production DAC-1 system went live in Warren in April 1963. At the time the 1301 was not ready, so an IBM 1401 and IBM 1405 were used instead. DAC-1 was one of the earliest production CAD systems to enter use, only the Itek built Digigraphics system beat it, albeit to the extent of a single machine before it was taken over by Control Data Corporation.First, pg. 8 In November 1963, DAC-1 was used to create a model of a trunk lid in a straight-through manner. An original sketch was read in, cleaned up on the terminal, converted into 3D and then output to a milling machine.Origins, pg. 53 =Alpine= With the successful delivery of DAC-1, IBM turned to commercializing the system in \\"Project Alpine\\". The results of Alpine were the IBM 2250 graphics terminal, 2280 film recorder and 2281 film scanner. Unlike the DAC-1's 7090, the Alpine products were all aimed for use with the newly announced IBM 360 series of computers. The graphics terminal was quite successful and IBM became a major CAD vendor. The film printer and scanner found little use among customers that were moving to all-digital workflows, and were later withdrawn as supported products. =End of DAC= DAC had always been intended to be a sort of \\"large area experiment\\", not a production system. As an experimental system, DAC was extremely successful, but the designers were well aware that additional development would be needed to make it really useful. In 1967 the CAD project was officially ended. By this point IBM had long abandoned the 7090 series for the 360, and was already working on its replacement, the IBM System/370. DAC was moved from Research to Fischer Body, but being outdated it was later donated to the University of Michigan.Origins, pg. 54 When polled, team leaders within the project universally pointed to the batch-oriented operating system as the primary impediment to a truly interactive design system, with computer performance and a hierarchical file system as secondary concerns. This led to the MCTS system, \\"Multiple Console Time Sharing System\\", a version of Multics adapted for their own use, which they developed on the CDC STAR-100 computer. Description=Operating system= The DAC-1 system included its own custom operating system, known, as was typical at the time, simply as \\"monitor\\". Monitor was based on the earlier batch processing systems developed at GM and IBM, but fed in the batches not from punched cards, but from the attached channel controllers instead. Terminals that had to exchange information with the host computer would place data in the controller for relay, which would cause an interrupt. The host machine would service the interrupt by copying the data from the terminal into the batch monitor, which would run it as if the input had come from a card stack. The DAC program consisted of a variety of small programs which were called by the batch monitor. Their output was then copied back to the terminals as if they were printers. Users who were not actively interacting with the terminals at any given time automatically gave up their time to other users. Although the term was not in widespread use at the time, the DAC-1 system was thus an early example of a time-sharing system. Unlike traditional batch systems, where operators manually scheduled workflows for fastest possible access to resources, DAC-1's workload would be unpredictable. This led to potential situations where one request could take a device offline for servicing, changing tapes for instance, only to have the next request data from that device. Although no general solution to the problem was found, the programmers invested considerable effort in ensuring that all of the modules needed for a particular operation could be loaded in a single \\"clump\\". The original 7090 had a single 32 kbyte bank of memory. In order to improve performance, the DAC-1 software was left in the core, isolated in one of two 16 kbyte logical banks. The other 16 kbytes held the batch monitor and an interrupt controller that drove it. With the introduction of the 7094, the two programs were separated into their own 32 kbyte physical stores. This left little room for user programs and data. After the DAC-1 was first installed, the original 7090 was relegated to other tasks and was replaced by an IBM 7094-II. In addition to being faster, this machine was equipped with two 32 kbyte core memory stores, an unusual arrangement. The two banks allowed DAC to have an entire 32 kbytes to itself. =Programming= Programming on the DAC system was in IBM's FORTRAN IV compiler, but it quickly became clear that a language with graphics primitives would be highly desirable. GM started with an existing ALGOL 58 derivative from the University of Michigan, MAD (Michigan Algorithm Decoder), adding to it and creating their own version, NOMAD. NOMAD also included the ability to allow code to run anywhere in memory, which was very important, especially on the earlier machine with limited memory. Over 90% of the DAC system was written in NOMAD.Origin, pg. 48 A similar language was also developed for the special task of running on the channel controllers. The new language was named \\"Maybe\\", because it was not clear whether or not it would work. Maybe turned into a joint effort between GM and the University of Michigan, and was indeed used on the production system. The DAC-1 system also included a custom language intended for the users, not the programmers. DGL, for descriptive geometry language\\" was a simple domain-specific language that contained a number of basic geometrical operators and variable assignment. Users could write programs in DGL and input them into DAC using punched cards. The result were new modules that the user could call within the interactive environment. =Terminals= DAC had been designed with a workflow in mind; paper and pencil sketching, digitizing on the reader, minor manipulation on the terminals, and then printing or modeling. In spite of it being the centerpiece of the operation, the graphics terminal was given little thought during the design process.Origin, pg. 49 Performance issues limited diagrams to about 1,000 vectors; at this point the refresh time became so slow the display would become difficult to use due to flickering. The IBM design used a capacitance screen with a metal pencil for input, providing a directly read X and Y coordinate. The basic system was similar to modern touch screen systems like the iPhone, but not sensitive enough to detect a finger and instead required a wired conductor to complete the circuit. The pencil replaced the light pens because it was much faster to decode; a light pen had to wait for a pulse of light when a vector was being redrawn and then work its way through the list of vectors to find out which one was selected. In use it was quickly discovered that holding the pen to the vertical monitor screen was extremely tiring, so the idea of using the terminal for input was abandoned. The GM team later visited Douglas Engelbart's lab where they saw the first computer mouse, and based future projects on this device instead. All of the terminals were connected to a single controller, and in turn to the 7090 via its Channel C input. Channel A and B were used to control magnetic tape drives, and Channel D controlled the 1301 disk.

It is the first Disney park resort in mainland China and the second in China, after the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. The resort opened to the public on June 16, 2016. The resort features Shanghai Disneyland Park, an entertainment district, two themed hotels, recreational facilities, a lake and associated parking and transportation hubs. Additional phases will see the development of two additional theme parks at the resort. The site will cover in Pudong, or approximately three times the size of Hong Kong Disneyland, at a cost of () for the new theme park and an additional () to build other aspects of the resort, totaling (). The Walt Disney Company owns 43 percent of the resort; the majority 57 percent is held by Shanghai Shendi Group, a joint venture of three companies owned by the Shanghai government. History China Eastern Airlines, the major airline based in Shanghai, painted one of its Airbus A330-300s in Shanghai Disney Resort livery Location scouting in Pudong began in 1999 with Bob Iger. The park was first envisaged in the early 2000s, and negotiation for Shanghai Disney Resort began around 2001. However, in order to help Hong Kong Disneyland grow, the Chinese national government deliberately slowed the development of Shanghai Disney. The Hong Kong resort opened in 2005, two years after the SARS epidemic devastated Hong Kong's economy, and it was hoped that Hong Kong Disneyland would help the city's tourism industry recover. On November 4, 2009, the Shanghai Municipal Government announced that the Shanghai Disney project had been approved by the national government, with an estimated total investment of . Land near the proposed production site dramatically increased in value after the announcement was made. In January 2011, a government official confirmed that Shanghai Disneyland would be 2‚Äì3 times the size of Hong Kong Disneyland and would eventually contain three theme parks. On April 7, 2011, groundbreaking began at the Shanghai Disneyland Resort site. Major construction work started on April 8, 2011, targeting a 2016 spring opening. The resort was planned to cover an area of and was expected to cost (). The project was financed by several large Chinese state- owned enterprises in Shanghai, who formed a joint venture with the Walt Disney Company. \\"The first-phase of the project will be to the South of Huanglou Area, an area in Chuansha Town, the southeast suburbs of Shanghai's Pudong area; the second phase will extend further southwest,\\" an urban developer from Shanghai stated. DeSimone Consulting Engineers were the structural engineers behind the construction work. On February 27, 2014, PepsiCo announced a strategic partnership with the resort, making the Shanghai Resort the first Disney property in 25 years to sell Pepsi products and not Coca-Cola products. On April 28, 2014, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced an extra investment to add additional rides and entertainment by opening day, bringing the total budget to . In February 2016, it was rumored that the resort was still behind schedule and was over budget, causing the United States-based resorts (Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney World Resort) to make budget cuts. That same month, Disney announced that Hong Kong Disneyland Resort reported its first loss in four years, losing , and falling 9.3% in annual attendance, to 6.8 million visitors. Analysts attributed this to fewer mainland Chinese tourists visit, hurt by a combination of China's slowdown, political unrest, and a weak yuan relative to the Hong Kong dollar, as well as the upcoming opening of the Shanghai Resort. In total, more than 100,000 workers constructed the first phase of the resort over 5 years. The facility incorporated 72,000 metric tons of structural steel and of utility piping. The final price tag was US$5.5 billion. =Operating= Shanghai Disney Resort officially opened at noon on June 16, 2016. It was reported that the \\"colorful opening ceremony\\" featured speeches, fireworks, and mostly orderly crowds in spite of the rain. One of the dignitaries, Vice Premier Wang Yang, joked that the wet weather foretold good luck for the resort because it represented a ‚Äúrain of U.S. dollars and RMB‚Äù. The park's first expansion, Toy Story Land, opened in second quarter 2018. On December 10, 2019, the resort began construction on its second expansion, Zootopia-themed land, next to Fantasyland. On January 26, 2020, the resort temporarily closed as a result of what became the COVID-19 pandemic. The resort partially reopened on March 9, with the Shanghai Disneyland Hotel, Disneytown, and Wishing Star Park resuming limited operations with new health and safety protocols in place. Disney fully reopened Shanghai Disney Resort on May 11, with new social distancing guidelines and temperature checks in place. Attractions and features=Shanghai Disneyland Park= Like most other Disney Resorts around the world, Shanghai Disneyland Resort features a flagship park called Shanghai Disneyland Park. The park is similar in style to Disney's other Disneyland- style parks, containing traditional and newly created themed lands. One of the aims of the park is the combination of Disney stories and characters with attractions that are specifically designed for Chinese guests. An interactive castle called Enchanted Storybook Castle lies at the center of the park. Other large-scale performance venues are found across the park. The original theme lands, or areas with the park are Adventure Isle, Gardens of Imagination, Mickey Avenue, Tomorrowland, Treasure Cove and Fantasyland. With the additional theme land added, Toy Story Land, the park has seven theme lands. In 2019, Disney announced a new theme land for the park, City of Zootopia, inspired in the 2016 Disney movie Zootopia. =Hotels= The resort has two themed hotels. The Shanghai Disneyland Hotel has 420 rooms and offer a free water taxi service across the Wishing Star Lake to the theme park. The Toy Story Hotel, with 800 rooms, features the Sunnyside Cafe, which is decorated with Chinese-style kites flown by Disney characters. =Disneytown= The Disneytown area features large venues for retail shopping, dining, and entertainment.

The name literally means \\"City Express\\". Deutsche Bahn no longer offers Stadt-Express services, but the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund tariff association still ordered them until December 2016. As a consequence, there were Stadt-Express lines in the RMV-area, but they were categorized by the Deutsche Bahn as either Regionalbahn or Regional-Express.

However, in the 'core' area of the conurbation, served by other local passenger trains like the S-Bahn and Regionalbahn trains, it runs faster, like a Regional-Express, and therefore only stops at the most important stations. While there are no more Stadt-Express services in Germany, several Regionalbahn or Regionalexpress services still follow the concept: For example, the RE 22 (Eifel-Express) stops from Cologne Messe/Deutz to Kall only at important stations, thereafter it stops at every station on the way to Gerolstein, like a Regionalbahn train, a service not provided on this section of the line. After Gerolstein it changes its designation to \\"RB 22\\" and runs officially as a Regionalbahn to Trier. Not all Stadt-Express routes followed this concept exactly; several services stopped at all stations even in the core area.

It links central Strausberg with the Strausberg railway station, where it connects with trains on the Berlin S-Bahn and the Niederbarnimer Eisenbahn. Although formally constituted and regulated as a railway, the line uses tramway style rolling stock and is superficially indistinguishable from a tramway. Overview The railway is operated by the company '. This company also operates the Straussee Ferry, an unusual electrically operated passenger cable ferry that crosses the Straussee lake from a landing close to the railway's Strausberg terminus. History The railway was originally opened in 1893, at which time it was operated by steam locomotives and carried both freight and passenger traffic. In 1921 the line was electrified, and a new street based routing opened for the final length into Strausberg. The originally routing remained open for freight traffic and was also electrified. In 1926, the line was extended from Lustgarten to Jugendheim, but this section closed in 1970. Freight traffic ceased in 2005, and the original routing was closed, along with the rail connection to the main line network. The railway is of standard gauge, has a length of about , and is electrified on the overhead system at 750 volts. From south to north, the line serves stops at Strausberg railway station, Landhausstra√üe, Schlagm√ºhle, Stadtwald, Hegerm√ºhle, Wolfstal, K√§the-Kollwitz-Stra√üe, Elisabethstra√üe and Lustgarten. The depot is situated on the original route, and is accessed by a curve just beyond the Lustgarten terminus. The line had been mainly operated by three ƒåKD Tatra KT8D5 tram cars, built in 1989/1990 and acquired from Ko≈°ice in 1995. A prototype ƒåKD Tatra T6C5 car, built in 1998 as a demonstrator for the United States market and operated on the New Orleans streetcar system for several months, had been acquired from Siemens (the new owners of Tatra) in 2003 and had been used in off-peak service. Two older Reko-Triebwagen TZ 69 cars, built in 1969 and acquired in the 1980s, were still available for passenger service, and a third had been converted into a works car. The railway also owns an even older preserved passenger car, dating from 1925. The Strausberg Railway joined the delivery framework of the BVG Berlin Transport Company ordering 2 Flexity Berlin trams on 5. September 2011. The two short double-sided two-cab trams were delivered in February and March 2013 replacing its older trams in daily service.

It is found within a complex type of group I introns also termed twin-ribozyme introns. Rather than splicing, it catalyses a branching reaction in which the 2'OH of an internal residue is involved in a nucleophilic attack at a nearby phosphodiester bond. As a result, the RNA is cleaved at an internal processing site (IPS), leaving a 3'OH and a downstream product with a 3 nt lariat at its 5' end. The lariat has the first and the third nucleotide joined by a 2',5' phosphodiester bond and is referred to as 'the lariat cap' because it caps an intron-encoded mRNA. The resulting lariat cap seems to contribute by increasing the half-life of the HE mRNA, thus conferring an evolutionary advantage to the HE.  Biological context  Schematic view of Dydimium iridis extrachromosomal rDNA and its twin-ribozyme system. The GIR1 ribozyme was originally discovered during the functional characterization of the introns from the extrachromosomal rDNA of the Didymium iridis protist. A combination of deletion and in vitro self-splicing analyses revealed a twin- ribozyme intron organization: two distinct ribozyme domains within the intron.  Structural organization  The twin-ribozyme introns represent some of the most complex organized group I introns known and consist of a homing endonuclease gene (HEG: I-DirI homing endonuclease) embedded in two functionally distinct catalytic RNA domains. One of the catalytic RNAs is a conventional group I intron ribozyme (GIR2) responsible for the intron splicing and reverse splicing, as well as intron RNA circularization. The other catalytic RNA domain is the group I-like ribozyme (GIR1) directly involved in homing endonuclease mRNA maturation.  Catalytic activity  In vitro, DiGIR1 catalyses three different reactions. The first one consists in hydrolysis of the scissile phosphate at the IPS site. This is the cleavage reaction observed with the full-length intron and several length variants with a relative low rate. The hydrolytic cleavage is irreversible and is considered an in vitro artefact resulting from misfolding of the catalytic site to present the branch nucleotide (BP) correctly for the reaction. The second reaction, the natural one, is the branching reaction, in which a transesterification at the IPS site results in the cleavage of the RNA with a 3'OH and a downstream lariat cap made by joining of the first and the third nucleotide by a 2'-5' phosphodiester bond. These products are the only products observed by analysis of cellular RNA. This branching reaction is in equilibrium with a third one: a ligation reaction. It is a very efficient reaction and it tends to mask the branching reaction during the in vitro branching experiments with the full-length intron and length variants that include more than 166 nucleotides upstream of the IPS.  Modelling structure of the Lariat capping (LC) Ribozyme  GIR1 models have been created using biochemical and mutational data. The structure contains an extended substrate domain which contains a GoU pair. The pair differs from the typical group 1 ribozyme nucleophilic residue, the J8/7 region has been reduced. These findings provide the basis for an evolutionary mechanism that accounts for the change from group I splicing ribozyme to the branching GIR1 architecture. This mechanism could potentially be applied to other large RNAs such as the ribonuclease P.  Crystal structure of the Lariat Capping Ribozyme  The crystal structure of the LC ribozyme was recently published. In brief, a circularly permutated (CP) ribozyme RNA was generated by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase. The 5' and 3' generated by circular permutation are located at the natural ribozyme cleavage site. To allow transcription of this construct, optimized 5' hammerhead and HdV (Hepatitis delay Virus) ribozymes were flanked to the LC CP construct. The crystal structure of the LC ribozyme unravels how the regulatory domain formed by P2, P2.1 and P10 works. Two sets of tertiary interactions take place to constrain P2 and P2.1 allowing the formation of a 3-way junction, which acts as a receptor for nt A209. This snug fit interaction promotes formation of the catalytic site, provided that the lariat is pre-folded by the ribozyme core.

Lines in the plane There are several possible ways to specify the position of a line in the plane. A simple way is by the pair where the equation of the line is y = mx + b. Here m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. This system specifies coordinates for all lines that are not vertical. However, it is more common and simpler algebraically to use coordinates where the equation of the line is lx + my + 1 = 0. This system specifies coordinates for all lines except those that pass through the origin. The geometrical interpretations of l and m are the negative reciprocals of the x and y-intercept respectively. The exclusion of lines passing through the origin can be resolved by using a system of three coordinates to specify the line in which the equation, lx + my + n = 0. Here l and m may not both be 0. In this equation, only the ratios between l, m and n are significant, in other words if the coordinates are multiplied by a non-zero scalar then line represented remains the same. So is a system of homogeneous coordinates for the line. If points in the real projective plane are represented by homogeneous coordinates , the equation of the line is lx + my + nz = 0, provided In particular, line coordinate represents the line z = 0, which is the line at infinity in the projective plane. Line coordinates and represent the x and y-axes respectively. Tangential equations Just as f(x, y) = 0 can represent a curve as a subset of the points in the plane, the equation œÜ(l, m) = 0 represents a subset of the lines on the plane. The set of lines on the plane may, in an abstract sense, be thought of as the set of points in a projective plane, the dual of the original plane. The equation œÜ(l, m) = 0 then represents a curve in the dual plane. For a curve f(x, y) = 0 in the plane, the tangents to the curve form a curve in the dual space called the dual curve. If œÜ(l, m) = 0 is the equation of the dual curve, then it is called the tangential equation, for the original curve. A given equation œÜ(l, m) = 0 represents a curve in the original plane determined as the envelope of the lines that satisfy this equation. Similarly, if œÜ(l, m, n) is a homogeneous function then œÜ(l, m, n) = 0 represents a curve in the dual space given in homogeneous coordinates, and may be called the homogeneous tangential equation of the enveloped curve. Tangential equations are useful in the study of curves defined as envelopes, just as Cartesian equations are useful in the study of curves defined as loci. Tangential equation of a point A linear equation in line coordinates has the form al + bm + c = 0, where a, b and c are constants. Suppose (l, m) is a line that satisfies this equation. If c is not 0 then lx + my + 1 = 0, where x = a/c and y = b/c, so every line satisfying the original equation passes through the point (x, y). Conversely, any line through (x, y) satisfies the original equation, so al + bm + c = 0 is the equation of set of lines through (x, y). For a given point (x, y), the equation of the set of lines though it is lx + my + 1 = 0, so this may be defined as the tangential equation of the point. Similarly, for a point (x, y, z) given in homogeneous coordinates, the equation of the point in homogeneous tangential coordinates is lx + my + nz = 0. Formulas The intersection of the lines (l1, m1) and (l2, m2) is the solution to the linear equations :l_1x+m_1y+1=0 :l_2x+m_2y+1=0. By Cramer's rule, the solution is :x=frac{m_1-m_2}{l_1m_2-l_2m_1},,y=-frac{l_1-l_2}{l_1m_2-l_2m_1}. The lines (l1, m1), (l2, m2), and (l3, m3) are concurrent when the determinant :begin{vmatrix} l_1 & m_1 & 1  l_2 & m_2 & 1  l_3 & m_3 & 1 end{vmatrix}=0. For homogeneous coordinates, the intersection of the lines (l1, m1, n1) and (l2, m2, n2) is :(m_1n_2-m_2n_1,,l_2n_1-l_1n_2,,l_1m_2-l_2m_1).

Dually, the coordinates of the line containing (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2) are :(y_1z_2-y_2z_1,,x_2z_1-x_1z_2,,x_1y_2-x_2y_1). Lines in three- dimensional space For two given points in the real projective plane, (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2), the three determinants :y_1z_2-y_2z_1,,x_2z_1-x_1z_2,,x_1y_2-x_2y_1 determine the projective line containing them. Similarly, for two points in RP3, (x1, y1, z1, w1) and (x2, y2, z2, w2), the line containing them is determined by the six determinants :x_1y_2-x_2y_1,,x_1z_2-x_1z_2,,y_1z_2-y_2z_1,,x_1w_2-x_2w_1,,y_1w_2-y_2w_1,,z_1w_2-z_2w_1. This is the basis for a system of homogeneous line coordinates in three- dimensional space called Pl√ºcker coordinates. Six numbers in a set of coordinates only represent a line when they satisfy an additional equation. This system maps the space of lines in three-dimensional space to projective space RP5, but with the additional requirement the space of lines corresponds to the Klein quadric, which is a manifold of dimension four. More generally, the lines in n-dimensional projective space are determined by a system of n(n ‚àí 1)/2 homogeneous coordinates that satisfy a set of (n ‚àí 2)(n ‚àí 3)/2 conditions, resulting in a manifold of dimension 2(n ‚àí 1). With complex numbers Isaak Yaglom has shownIsaak Yaglom (1968) Complex Numbers in Geometry, Academic Press how dual numbers provide coordinates for oriented lines in the Euclidean plane, and split-complex numbers form line coordinates for the hyperbolic plane. The coordinates depend on the presence of an origin and reference line on it. Then, given an arbitrary line its coordinates are found from the intersection with the reference line. The distance s from the origin to the intersection and the angle Œ∏ of inclination between the two lines are used: :z = (tan frac {theta}{2}) (1 + s epsilon) is the dual number for a Euclidean line, and :z = (tan frac {theta}{2}) (cosh s + j sinh s) is the split-complex number for a line in the Lobachevski plane. Since there are lines ultraparallel to the reference line in the Lobachevski plane, they need coordinates too: There is a unique common perpendicular, say s is the distance from the origin to this perpendicular, and d is the length of the segment between reference and the given line. :z = (tanh frac {d}{2}) (sinh s + j cosh s) denotes the ultraparallel line. The motions of the line geometry are described with linear fractional transformations on the appropriate complex planes.  See also  * Robotics conventions References *.

There are several branches that exist such as Carrillo de Albornoz, Carrillo de Mendoza, Carrillo de Figueroa, Carrillo de Toledo and Carrillo Tablas among others. There are also several variations in spelling of the surname Carrillo such as \\"Carillo\\" or \\"Sciarrillo\\". Records prove that both surnames are one and the same.  History = Name origins = Carrillo is a Spanish surname. References to the origins of the name dates back to the Kingdom of Castile in the thirteenth century. According to a legend of family origin, two brothers of royalty (their country of origin is unknown; but, it is presumed to have been France) were on a tour visiting foreign lands. Misfortune came upon the brothers when they accidentally killed a courtier of the King of Italy. The brothers had to flee into hiding to avoid the king's rage (it is said that the brothers dueled with the courtier over the honor of a beautiful Spanish maiden). The brothers fled to Spain, and were placed under the protection of The Count of Castile Fern√°n Gonz√°lez of Castile.(Alberto y Arturo Garc√≠a Carrafa, 2003)(Nobiliario, Cardinal Alonso de Carrillo Laso) Legend states that the brothers were strongly loyal to one another, and always traveled together. They were happy in demeanor, and good in nature. Once accepted into Spanish society, the brothers were so grateful that they devoted themselves to a stronger religious and spiritual commitment among themselves, and became very patriotic. The brothers devoted themselves to serve their new country and they pledged their loyalty to the Monarchy of Spain. It is said that when seen together, many would described the brothers very much like \\"los carillones de la iglesia\\" (the carillon bells of a church) as they were always together, and drew bright attention to themselves due to their devoted works, and outspoken dedication to the Crown and Church. Because the brothers' language of origin gave them distinct accents, they called themselves Carrillo (a compromised version of \\"carillon\\", and one more easily accommodated by the Spanish language). The brothers endeared themselves to the Castilians, and married two daughters of a noble Count. The count of Castile made it possible to ennoble the brothers and attain the titles of Count of Priego for the elder brother, and Marquis De La Guardia for the younger. All lines of the Carrillo family are said to branch from these two brothers. The name Carrillo also appears in connection with an ancient Spanish legend concerning the Siete Infantes de Lara (Seven Princes of Lara). Through time, the name Carrillo has been subject to several false etymologies and irrelevant definitions, but the legendary story has roots in anecdotal evidence and tradition. The meaning of the surname Carrillo is derived from both definitions of \\"carillones\\" in Spanish and \\"carrillon\\" in French. The surname \\"Carrillo\\" is first found in Castile, Spain, in Burgos, Palencia, Soria, Logro√±o, Navarre, and Andalucia. Family members later went off to help in the conquest and establishment of colonies outside Spain, and included Cuba, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Venezuela, Costa Rica, Colombia, Chile, Philippines, Argentina, and the United States of America, particularly California.  Influence and service  The House of Carrillo frequently served the government through holding many offices and providing military leaders for Spain. Since the reign of Alfonso X the Wise, the office of \\"Alcalde Mayor de los Hidalgos de Castilla\\" has been in the Carrillo lineage. This palatine position of justice sentenced exclusively in the lawsuits of nobility and in matters related to the nobility of the litigants. Effective throughout the Middle Ages, until the remodeling of the Chancilleries carried out by the Catholic Monarchs; from 1572 it became a merely honorary position. The House of Carrillo has also produced three Catholic Cardinals, Cardinal Alonso de Carrillo Laso, Cardinal Alonso Carrillo de Albornoz and Cardinal Gil Alvarez Carrillo de Albornoz. The most famous military leader produced by the House of Carrillo is Jos√© Carrillo de Albornoz, 1st Duke of Montemar who was Viceroy of Sicily. He victoriously lead the Spanish forces at the Battle of Bitonto.

Additionally, more serious emergencies, such as bomb threats and other antagonistic attacks, epidemics, natural disasters and war. In most cases, the responsibility for on-scene action does not lie with the Civil Contingencies Agency but with municipal rescue services, law enforcement agencies or other agencies. History The Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency was established 1 January 2009, when it replaced the now defunct Swedish Rescue Services Agency (), the Swedish Emergency Management Agency () and the Swedish National Board of Psychological Defence (). During the 2018 Sweden wildfires, Sweden requested help from European Union through the Emergency Response Coordination Centre at the European Commission's Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations department. Sweden received help from Estonia, France, Finland, Germany, Italy, Lithuania, Poland and Portugal. The help included firefighters, equipment and water bombing aircraft. Polish state- owned television channel Telewizja Polska later claimed that \\"Sweden needed help as the country lacks firefighting capabilities, having prioritized spending on immigration and gender theory education.\\", due to the agency having spent 1.9% of their research budget (21m SEK, roughly ‚Ç¨2m) on equality and on gender theory to investigate relations during crisis management. The agency responded that they considered the accusation to be fake news, as the agency has nothing to do with firefighting, as Swedish fire and rescue service brigades are funded by the municipalities and regions. Organisation The MSB is based in Stockholm, Karlstad, Kristinehamn and Ljung. The MSB also has some colleges in Sand√∂, Revinge and Rosersberg. The agency has about 850 employees, led by Director-General Dan Eliasson.

Multiple characters have assumed the Green Goblin alias in comics. The first and most well-known iteration Norman Osborn was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko and debuted in The Amazing Spider-Man #14 (July 1964), though the Goblin's identity as Osborn was not revealed until The Amazing Spider-Man #37 (June 1966). The second character to adopt the Green Goblin alias was Harry Osborn in The Amazing Spider-Man #136 (September 1974). The character has been substantially adapted from the comics into various forms of media, such as feature films, television series and video games. In most versions, Norman is the Goblin, though some also depicted Harry as the Goblin. Norman was portrayed by Willem Dafoe in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man film trilogy and Chris Cooper in the 2014 film The Amazing Spider-Man 2 while Neil Ross, Alan Rachins, Steve Blum, Steven Weber and Josh Keaton provided the character's voice throughout various animated Spider-Man series over the years. Meanwhile, Harry was played by James Franco in the Spider-Man trilogy and by Dane DeHaan in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 while Gary Imhoff, Ian Ziering, James Arnold Taylor, Matt Lanter and Max Mittleman all voiced the character in various Spider-Man television series. Television= Spider-Man (1967‚Äì1970 TV series) = The Norman Osborn version of Green Goblin appeared in the 1960s Spider-Man animated series, voiced by Len Carlson. The character is depicted as a dimwitted, spoiled robber who is obsessed with magic and the supernatural - fields of expertise that the original iteration is never interested in, preferring to use technology to commit crimes. = Spider-Man (1981‚Äì1982 TV series) = The Norman Osborn version of Green Goblin appeared in the 1981 solo Spider-Man animated series, voiced by English actor Neil Ross. This depiction was much closer to the comic book original than the preceding animated incarnation. He appears in the episode \\"Revenge of the Green Goblin\\". In the episode's continuity, Spider-Man first faced and defeated the Goblin three years earlier, during which the opponents were unmasked to each other. Having regained his memory during a train accident at the start of the episode, Osborn resumes his Goblin persona and equipment, and threatens to reveal Spider-Man's true identity to the world. Harry Osborn is mentioned in the episode \\"The Vulture Has Landed\\". = Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends (1981‚Äì1983) = The Norman Osborn version of Green Goblin appeared in Spider- Man and His Amazing Friends, voiced by Dennis Marks. This incarnation is similar to the Lizard, with the Goblin being a different personality of Osborn that occasionally takes over to commit crimes. He also has a niece, Mona Osborn (voiced by Sally Julian), who was unaware of her uncle's double identity. In the series premiere \\"Triumph of the Green Goblin\\", Osborn becomes the Goblin again after a plane crash, and kidnaps Mona to lead him to the location of his formula that will allow him to transform New York's population into goblins. Osborn is eventually cured by lightning and sent back to a medical institute. = Spider-Man (1994‚Äì1998 TV series) = Both versions of Green Goblin appeared in the 1990s Spider-Man: The Animated Series; Neil Ross reprises the role from the 1981 series as Norman Osborn while Gary Imhoff voices Harry Osborn. Norman is the owner of OsCorp Industries, depicted as a weapons manufacturing company under the influence of the Kingpin, whom he later tries to have killed by the Hobgoblin. Norman eventually turns the Goblin in season three, after a lab accident at Oscorp causes him to develop an alternate, more violent and chaotic personality. The Goblin targets Norman's rivals, but is defeated by Spider-Man, although his identity remains a secret and Norman is shown to have no memories of the event. Later, the Goblin resurfaces inside Norman, and seeks to eliminate Spider-Man, the Kingpin, and the Hobgoblin. He obtains a time dilation accelerator and, after learning Spider-Man's secret identity, kidnaps Mary Jane Watson who is thrown into a dimensional portal opened by the accelerator. Spider-Man then defeats him, and the Goblin ends up falling into the same portal and is trapped in Limbo. Harry is depicted as Peter Parker's best friend, although he grows jealous of after his begins dating Mary Jane Watson. Following both Norman's and Mary Jane's disappearance, Harry gets saddened and furious with Spider- Man. He is eventually driven over the edge and begins having visions of the Goblin who offers to tell him where his father is if he kills Spider-Man. As the second Goblin, he then attempts to carry out his revenge against the web- slinger, but is defeated by the combined efforts of Spider-Man and the Punisher and sent to Ravencroft, where he receives medical treatment for his insanity. He later escapes and crashes Peter's and Mary Jane's wedding, demanding that the latter marry him instead. After Liz Allan reveals her feelings for him and convinces him that his friends care about his as well, Harry surrenders and returns to Ravencroft to continue his treatment. An alternate version of Green Goblin (Norman Osborn) appears in the series finale's first part. In an alternate reality where Spider-Carnage destroyed New York, the Goblin is shown to have be one of the enforcers, and is defeated by a number of Spider-Men from different realities. = Spider-Man Unlimited (1999‚Äì2001) = A Counter-Earth version of Green Goblin appeared in the Spider-Man Unlimited animated series, voiced by Rino Romano. This version's alter-ego is Hector Jones, and is portrayed as a hero who is helping the rebellion against the High Revolutionary. He also uses a backpack that sprouts wings instead of a glider. The Goblin first appears in \\"Where Evil Nests\\", when mistaking Spider-Man for a villain. After putting aside their differences, the pair work together to save Naoko Yamada-Jones and Shayne Yamada-Jones from one of Venom's and Carnage's plans; it is implied that the Goblin is Naoko's jealous ex-husband. In \\"Sustenance\\", the Goblin learns Spider-Man's secret identity and that latter is from Earth, having come here to rescue John Jameson, but since Jameson refuses to leave until the High Revolutionary is defeated, the Goblin offers to help Spider-Man regain his ship from the High Evolutionary. The pair team up with the Rejects, a group of Beastials that the High Evolutionary got rid of since they proved useless, to do so, only for Spider-Man to then crash the ship into one of the High Evolutionary's towers. In the series finale \\"Destiny Unleashed\\", the Goblin is revealed to have survived and joined the Rejects, and briefly leaves them to help Spider-Man and the rebels fight against the High Evolutionary. He is one of the characters who run off when thousands of symbiotes are unleashed upon Counter-Earth according to Venom's and Carnage's plans. = Spider-Man: The New Animated Series (2003) = Harry Osborn appeared in Spider-Man: The New Animated Series, voiced by Ian Ziering. This version, pictured as a blonde, is Peter Parker's best friend, but has despises Spider-Man who he blames for his father's death prior to the series' events. However, he shows signs of beginning to put the grudge aside in later episodes. Norman Osborn is alluded multiple times, making small cameos as both a hallucination to Harry and in a photograph. He apparently was the Green Goblin and died in a battle against Spider-Man at some point prior the events of the series; however, no one other than the web-slinger knows about his alter-ego. = The Spectacular Spider-Man (2008‚Äì2009) = The two major versions of Green Goblin appear in The Spectacular Spider-Man animated series, voiced by Steve Blum; the character's identity hints are either Norman Osborn (voiced by Alan Rachins) or Harry Osborn (voiced by James Arnold Taylor) as the character. Norman is portrayed as Oscorp's cold and calculating head who is known to never apologise and has a strained relationship with his son. In season one, he is hired by crime lord Tombstone to create several supervillains to distract Spider-Man from Tombstone's crimes. Norman's experiments result in the Sandman and Rhino. The Goblin later appears as a mysterious criminal equipped with stolen technology from Oscorp, attempting to overthrow Tombstone as New York's reigning crime boss, causing the lab accident behind the villain Doctor Octopus, and has two battles with Spider-Man but gets defeated in the second. Spider-Man follows the Goblin to Oscorp and is suspicious that it's Norman behind the mask, only to find Harry in the Goblin costume. Spider-Man and Norman then conclude that Harry's theft and consumption of ‚ÄúGobulin Green‚Äù resulted in the Goblin persona to fight Tombstone. After Spider-Man agrees to keep Harry's secret on the condition that the villain never reappears, Norman embarks on a tour to Europe with Harry so his son can overcome the addiction. In season two, Norman returns with Harry to New York, and hires Miles Warren to be one of the scientists to work at ESU alongside Curt Connors. He also begins to mentor Peter Parker. After Tombstone, Silvermane and Doctor Octopus are all arrested by Spider-Man, the Goblin resurfaces as the new \\"Big Man of Crime\\" in New York. He again tries to kill Spider-Man, first by using Molten Man, and then by trapping Spider-Man in an advanced prison alongside many criminals put away by the web-slinger, but both attempts fail. In the series finale, the Goblin has a final showdown with Spider-Man, and is unmasked as Norman revealing that he framed Harry to protect his identity, and tries to justify his actions by claiming of only protecting Harry. A grueling battle with Spider-Man then sends him crashing into a stash of his own pumpkin bombs where he seemingly dies. However, Norman is later shown to have survived and leaves New York under a fake identity. Harry, meanwhile, is depicted as Peter Parker's and Gwen Stacy's best friend who has a strained relationship with his father and longs to impress him. In season one, the stress and constant disappointment in Harry's life prompt him to steal Oscorp's experimental formula \\"Gobulin Green\\", which increases his self-esteem and aggressivity. He is later believed to be the Goblin after Norman frames him to cover up for the Goblin's actions, and goes on a tour to Europe with his father to overcome his Gobulin Green addiction. In season two, Harry begins dating Gwen, and later helps Spider-Man unmask the Goblin, learning that it was his father all along. After Norman is seemingly killed in a battle with Spider-Man, Harry vows revenge on the web- slinger. = Ultimate Spider-Man (2012‚Äì2017) = Several depictions of Green Goblin appear in the Ultimate Spider-Man animated series: *The first version is Norman Osborn (voiced by Steven WeberChing, Albert (July 23, 2011). \\"SDCC 2011: MARVEL Television LIVE!\\". Newsarama.). His Green Goblin form is an amalgam of his Ultimate Marvel iteration's green-skinned monster appearance and his original incarnation's use of a glider and pumpkin bombs. In season one, Osborn has a strained relationship with his son Harry and is Doctor Octopus's initial employer, whom he has help in a master plan is to obtain Spider-Man's DNA for a mass-produced Spider-Soldier army, unaware that Peter Parker was bitten by Oscorp's genetically modified spider. Doctor Octopus's genetic guesswork for Osborn results in a living armor always needing a host: the Venom symbiote. Norman later discovers Harry's connection to Venom and gets intrigued by his son's abilities. Osborn ultimately lures Spider-Man to Oscorp's secret lab, but Doctor Octopus betrays Osborn by injecting him with a serum mixed with both Spider-Man's and Venom's DNA, resulting in his Goblin transformation. While savage at first, he soon regains his intelligence, and later attacks the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, stealing a glider and electric gauntlents. When the Venom symbiote resurfaces inside Harry, the Goblin tries to have Venom join him, but fails before escaping with the symbiote. In season two, the Goblin returns with a different glider and gauntlets. He kidnaps Peter, injecting Peter with a symbiote sample that transforms into the Carnage symbiote whom he sends to kill Spider-Man. When Venom arrives instead, he's outmatched, forcing the Goblin to flee. He later allows himself to be captured and taken to the Helicarrier, whereupon he releases the symbiote to infect everyone aboard. To battle Spider-Man, he briefly is Venom himself before Doctor Octopus creates a cure for those infected by the Venom symbiote, restoring the Goblin back to his human form in the process. Osborn later tries to make amends for his crimes as the superhero Iron Patriot, and acts an ally of Spider-Man's team, until Doctor Octopus transforms him back into the Goblin. The Goblin tries to transform all of New York's population into goblins, but is thwarted by Spider-Man and captured. The Goblin continues causing strife in Ultimate Spider-Man: Web Warriors. He is unintentionally released during a battle between Spider-Man's team and Taskmaster's team, and goes on to steal the Siege Perilous and imprsion Electro inside it, creating a device that allows him to travel between dimensions in an attempt to collect DNA samples of different versions of Spider-Man which he then uses to become the even more deranged Spider-Goblin. He also reveals that he deduced Spider- Man's secret identity, before he is defeated by the Spider-Men from all the dimensions he visited and restored to his human form, in the process losing all memories of his time as the Goblin, including Peter's identity. He is called the Goblin King during a dream created by the villain Nightmare to torment Spider-Man. In an alternate future where Peter stopped being Spider- Man, the Goblin King killed most of Earth's heroes and took their weapons as trophies. Ultimately, Spider-Man is able to defeat the Goblin King and escape from the nightmare. Osborn is again an ally of Spider-Man and adopts his Iron Patriot moniker again in Ultimate Spider-Man Vs. the Sinister Six. It's revealed that he inoculated himself with an anti-goblin serum as a promise to Harry which he provides Spider-Man large quantities, helps defeat Doctor Octopus when another attempt is made on his life, and deals with further aggravation with the Anti-Venom symbiote. In the series finale, Osborn helps restore Spider-Man's powers, and also reveals that he recovered his memories but kept Peter's identity secret out of respect. *Harry Osborn (voiced by Matt Lanter) does not use the Green Goblin moniker, but instead serves as the Venom symbiote's first major host. He is Peter Parker's best friend, Norman's estranged son, a student at Midtown High School, and a friend to both Mary Jane Watson and Flash Thompson. While he plays a relatively minor role in the first three seasons, he has had some major appearances, mainly in scenarios involving his father and Venom, and fought Spider-Man's allies several times as Venom, before he eventually rejected the symbiote's control. He also mended his relationship with his father after he ceased being the Goblin. Harry acts as the superhero Patrioteer in Ultimate Spider-Man Vs. the Sinister Six as well as the host of the Anti-Venom symbiote. He is left in a coma by an ion- inhibitor, but recovers when the Carnage symbiote infests Manhattan and sacrifices the Anti-Venom symbiote in the process. He later resumes his Patrioteer moniker, and presumably joins the S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy, as he is seen at the Triskelion in the series finale. *The third version is the Ultimate Marvel iteration of Green Goblin (also voiced by Steven Weber). He resembles Norman Osborn's version except he has demonic-esque wings. This version managed to kill his universe's Spider-Man, although Miles Morales later took on the Ultimate Spider-Man persona and became his new archenemy. Introduced in Ultimate Spider-Man: Web Warriors, the Goblin first appears when he battles the \\"prime\\" Spider-Man and Ultimate Spider-Man, as well as his prime counterpart, claiming that only he is rightful of killing Spider-Man, but is ultimately defeated. The Goblin returns in Ultimate Spider-Man Vs. the Sinister Six, where he is summoned by Baron Mordo via the Siege Perilous into the prime universe. Using the Siege Perilous' destrictive capabilities, he fights Spider-Man, Doctor Strange and Kid Arachnid, forcing the latter to destroy the Siege Perilious, which leaves both Kind Arachnid and the Goblin stranded in the prime universe. The Goblin is later recruited by Doctor Octopus into the Sinister Six and takes part in the team's attack on the Triskelion, during which he is defeated by Spider-Man. *The fourth version is a female incarnation of Green Goblin (voiced by Wendie Malick). Norma Osborn is the Green Goblin of a universe where everyone's gender is reversed, and the nemesis of Spider-Girl (Petra Parker). Her Goblin outfit resembles that of the classic Green Goblin from the comics, though she also dons electric gauntlents like her prime counterpart. In Ultimate Spider-Man: Web Warriors, her prime universe counterpart arrives in the gender-swapped universe and the two Goblins joins forces to eliminate their respective versions of Spider-Man. While the prime Goblin manages to escape to another reality, Norma is defeated by the combined efforts of Spider-Man and Spider-Girl. = Spider-Man (2017‚Äìpresent) = Harry Osborn (voiced by Max Mittelman) and Norman Osborn (voiced by Josh Keaton) appear in the 2017 Spider-Man animated series, though neither adopt the Green Goblin moniker. Harry is the creator of the Goblin technology which he uses to fight crime as a superhero, eventually adopting the Hobgoblin alias which is an amalgamation of his Ultimate Marvel incarnation and Phil Urich. He is Peter Parker's best friend, a student at Horizon High and later Osborn Academy, a friend to both Gwen Stacy and Anya Corazon. Throughout season one, he views Spider-Man as a menace during their various encounters. He proves instrumental in curing the Jackal's Spider virus, and in the process discovers that Peter is Spider-Man, which fractures their friendship. He's later convinced that Spider-Man is a menace by working with the Sinister Six, but learns that Peter is actually being mind-controlled by Doctor Octopus and rescues his friend, with the pair mending their friendship in the process. Harry later discovers that his father tried to kill Spider-Man, but chooses to side with his friend and witnesses his father's apparent death in an explosion. Following this, Harry remains friends with Peter, and becomes Oscorp's new CEO. In season two, Harry dons a more streamlined attire to aid the Spider Team against the Goblin Nation. Norman is Harry's strict father who has high expectations and Oscorp's CEO. In season one, he establishes the Osborn Academy for Geniuses as a way of saving Harry from embarrassment after being suspended from Horizon High (though it is later revealed that he caused Harry's suspension) while also recruiting Spider-Man's current and future rogues, such as Doctor Octopus, Vulture, Alistair Smythe and Aleksei Sytsevich while plotting against the Spider-Men (Peter Parker and Miles Morales), Max Modell and Raymond Warren. Exposure to the Jackal's spider virus subsequently mutates him into the Spider King, but he is cured along with everyone else mutated. Norman later entrusts Harry to destroy Spider-Man so that his son would be New York's sole protector. When his son refuses, Norman dons impersonates the Hobgoblin in an attempt to kill Spider-Man himself. A final confronation with Spider-Man and Harry in his lab results in it getting caught on fire to which Norman seemingly perishes in a green chemical explosion. He returns in Spider-Man: Maximum Venom restored as the Dark Goblin using a combination of symbiote DNA and the Jackal's latest serum. He is also revealed to have been collaborating with Dr. Curt Connors, Jackal, Swarm, and the Chameleon to formulate a conspiracy to turn the board of education against Spider-Man and Max. However, Norman is reverted into human form and taken into custody while his conspiracy is exposed to the board of education by the Spider Team. = Other appearances = The Norman Osborn version of Green Goblin makes several non-speaking appearances in the anime Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers. He also appears in Marvel Future Avengers, voiced by Hiroshi Yanaka in Japanese and Dave Wittenberg in English. Film=Sam Raimi series= alt= Both incarnations of Green Goblin appear In Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy, with Willem Dafoe portraying Norman Osborn, and James Franco playing Harry Osborn: * The Green Goblin first appears as the main antagonist of the 2002 film, with Norman portrayed as OsCorp's strong- minded yet troubled head who has a distant relationship with his son while possessing a deep respect and admiration for Peter Parker. Harry, meanwhile, is Peter's best friend and yearns to impress his father, growing jealous of Peter's closeness to him. The Green Goblin is depicted as an alternate personality who \\"speaks\\" to Norman through a mirror in his home. Acting as the unhinged enforcer of Norman's desires, the Goblin claims that Norman is too weak to achieve them himself. After being faced with the loss of military funding that would meand the end of OsCorp due to taking too long to develop their super soldier formula, Norman decides to test it on himself. It enhances his strength, but also drives him insane, leading to the creation of his alternate personality. Stealing an experimental glider and cybernetic flight suit, the Goblin kills the military contractors who threatened to pull out of their deal with Oscorp, leaving Norman with no memory of the incident. Months later, rival firm Quest Aerospace offers to buy out OsCorp, prompting the company's main shareholders to fire Norman from his CEO position. The Goblin later exacts revenge by killing the shareholders during OsCorp's World Unity Festival, where he also fights Spider-Man for the first time. Later, he proposes Spider-Man to join forces, and when the hero refuses, the Goblin vows to kill him. After deducing his secret identity as Peter, the Goblin kidnaps Mary Jane Watson and forces Spider-Man to choose between rescuing her or a car full of Roosevelt Island Tramway passengers. Spider-Man rescues both, and then battles the Goblin in a cemetery, during which the villain is unmasked as Norman and defeated. In a final attempt to kill Peter, Norman accidentally stabs himself with his glider and asks Peter not to tell Harry about the monster he had become, before dying. Later, Harry holds Spider-Man responsible as his father's murderer and vows revenge, unaware that his father was the Goblin. * In Spider-Man 2 (2004), Norman remains an antagonistic presence as a spirit haunting Harry, urging him to avenge his death. Two years after the first movie, Harry has taken over OsCorp and still seeks revenge against Spider-Man. He funds Otto Octavius' fusion power experiment, but loses all the money he invested when the experiment fails, with devastating consequences. After Octavius becomes a villain and attempts to recreate the experiment, Harry strikes an alliance with him, providing a rare hydrogen isotope he needs to complete a fusion reactor in exchange for Octavius' capture of Spider-Man. Upon unmasking the hero, Harry is shocked he is Peter, and later refuses to kill him when a hallucination of his father in a mirror demands him to. After smashing the mirror in anger, Harry finds a secret lair containing the Green Goblin's equipment, and deduces that his father was the infamous villain. * In Spider-Man 3 (2007), Harry has become the New Goblin to exact his revenge on Peter. He uses the same performance-enhancing gas as his father and adapts most of the Goblin's leftover weapons into his own arsenal including retractable arm-blades and an ionic sword. After a fight with Peter early on in the film, Harry is knocked unconscious and sustains amnesia; he remembers his father's death, but not Spider-Man's involvement or his identity, allowing him and Peter to be friends again. However, Harry later recovers his memories after another hallucination of his father urges him to avenge his death. Againg seeking revenge, he sabotages Peter's relationship with Mary Jane and then claims that she left Peter for him. Under the symbiote's influence, Peter fights Harry in his penthouse, culminating with Peter throwing one of Harry's pumpkin bombs back at him, which scars the right side of Harry's face and leaves him half-blind. At the climax of his film, Harry learns the truth about his father's death from his butler, and becomes the New Goblin one final time to save his friends when Venom and Sandman kidnap Mary Jane to lure out and kill Spider-Man. During the battle, Harry takes a fatal blow meant for Peter, and later dies with his two friends at his side. =Marc Webb series= * The Harry Osborn incarnation of the Green Goblin appears in the 2014 film The Amazing Spider-Man 2, portrayed by Dane DeHaan. This incarnation is also Peter Parker's best friend, although the two have been separated for years due to Harry being sent to a boarding school. After coming home, he reunites with his estranged father Norman (played by Chris Cooper), who reveals that he is dying from fictitious \\"retroviral hyperplasia,\\" a genetic disease that begins to develop at Harry's age. Norman gives Harry a small device containing all his research, and dies the following day. Now the CEO of Oscorp, Harry analyzes the device, and learns that he and Richard Parker worked together to develop genetically-altered spiders, which could be used to create a cure for his disease. Believing that Spider-Man's blood could work as well, Harry asks for Peter's help in finding him. However, when Peter visits Harry as Spider-Man, he refuses to help, out of fear at the possible side effects, which leads Harry to despise Spider-Man. Later, Harry learns from his assistant, Felicia Hardy, that the spiders' venom was stored in Oscorp's Special Projects division before their destruction. Upon being framed by Donald Menken for Max Dillon's accident (which transformed him into Electro) and subsequently fired from Oscorp, Harry frees Electro and enlists his help in getting back at Oscorp, whereupon he forces Menken to take him to the spider venom. However, the venom only accelerates Harry's disease and disfigures him, forcing him to steal a prototype suit that partially heals him, and a glider. He then confronts Spider-Man after Electro's defeat and, deducing his identity, kidnaps Gwen Stacy. After a battle at a clock tower, Harry is ultimately defeated, but Spider-Man fails to save Gwen from falling to her death. Later, Harry is imprisoned at Ravencroft and is visited by Gustav Fiers, with whom he arranges the formation of a team to take down Spider-Man. * Both Chris Cooper and Dane DeHaan were set to reprise their roles in the Sinister Six spin-off and The Amazing Spider-Man 3, with Norman Osborn successfully coming back to life after freezing his head and becoming the Sinister Six's leader. However, due to Marvel Studios and Sony reaching a deal to produce a second reboot of the Spider-Man film franchise, the sequel and spin-off were cancelled.https://variety.com/2015/film/news/details-spider-man-appear-in- sony-and-marvel-movies-1201429039/ =Animation= * The Norman Osborn version of Green Goblin appears in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, voiced by Jorma Taccone.

During the battle, the Goblin shoves Spider-Man into the Collider's blast, resulting in an explosion that severely injures Spider-Man and kills the Goblin, whose corpse is later found buried under rubble by Miles.

To do so, they send several flying robots after him, and later create spider- shaped robots to track him down, but both of these attempts fail. After being fired for taking too much time to develop the super soldier serum, Osborn decides to tries it on himself, which leads to his transformation into the Green Goblin. He attacks a festival and kills the board of directors members that fired him, before fighting Spider-Man, to whom he offers an alliance, but the hero refuses.

Jackson, and the Harry Osborn version (the New Goblin) again voiced by Josh Keaton. In the opening cutscene, the Green Goblin is shown fighting Spider-Man alongside other villains, until the New Goblin comes to his aid and helps him defeat them. Both Goblins are then attacked by P.H.A.N.T.O.M.s under the command of Mysterio, and captured alongside the other villains. While the New Goblin's whereabouts remain unknown, the Green Goblin is placed under mind control and sent to retrieve a meteor shard from Tokyo. There, Spider-Man defeats the Goblin and destroys the mind-controlling device. He then joins forces with Spider-Man to exact revenge on Mysterio, and becomes a playable character. The New Goblin is also a playable character, unlocked after beating the game, although he is identical to the Green Goblin in terms of combat. * The Norman Osborn version of Green Goblin appears in the Nintendo DS version of Spider- Man: Web of Shadows voiced again by Roger L. Jackson. Black Cat informs Spider-Man that the Goblin is setting up bombs as part of a plot to defeat the symbiotes invading Manhattan, and Spider-Man is given the choice of helping him up to two times.

Similarly to the film, Harry becomes the CEO of Oscorp after his father dies from a terminal illness, and later discovers that he is slowly dying from the same illness, becoming desperate for a cure. In a departure from the film's plot, Harry also works with Wilson Fisk to finance the Enchaned Crime Task Force, meant to help the police contain criminals more easily, unaware that Fisk is planning to use it to replace Spider-Man, and that he plots to take over Oscorp once Harry dies. After discovering that Spider-Man's blood could help cure him, Harry asks for his help, but Spider- Man refuses, out of fear at the possible side effects, leading Harry to despise him. He later injects himself with Richard Parker's spider venom in the hopes of curing his illness, but it disfigures him and drives him insane.

In the game, the other Goblin characters are alternative reality versions of the mainstream version. * The Osborns appear in the 2018 Spider-Man game, with Norman voiced by Mark Rolston and Harry voiced by Scott Porter.  Norman is the former CEO and co-founder of Oscorp alongside his former friend and college lab partner Otto Octavius, and the mayor of New York City. Corrupt and self-serving, Norman uses his position to have Oscorp technology implemented throughout New York City. He is responsible for the creation of \\"Devil's Breath\\", an experimental medical treatment for genetic disorders (closer to a bio-weapon in its current form) in an effort to save the life of his terminally ill son. Norman's crimes drive much of the game's plot, with Mister Negative and later Doctor Octopus wreaking havoc throughout New York City in an attempt to exact revenge. While Spider-Man is able to contain the damage caused by the villains and save Norman's life, Norman's actions, including his decision to hire Sable International as a security force (resulting in massive civil rights violations), force him to resign as mayor in disgrace. The game also references his future persona as Green Goblin in a level where Mary Jane Watson uncovers a secret lab in Norman's penthouse containing experimental weaponry and genetically modified spiders similar to the ones behind Spider- Man's powers.  Harry is Peter Parker and Mary Jane's friend and, unlike his father, selfless and very carrying towards others. He was inspired by his mother to be an environmentalist attorney and set up various research stations in New York to monitor air pollution which Spider-Man can help with in a side- quest, allowing Oscorp to approve Harry's data. Although Norman tell Peter and Mary Jane that Harry is on a vacation in Europe, he's actually a victim of Oshtoran Syndrome, the same degenerative genetic disease that killed his mother. Norman's work towards developing a cure led to the creating of the deadly virus code-named \\"Devil's Breath\\". He first kept his illness a secret from Peter and Mary Jane because he was worried of how'd they react if they found out, until he eventually reveals the truth to them via a letter when his illness worsens up. Before his medication process to keep his illness in-check from being even fatal, Harry asked his father to send the letter to both Peter and Mary Jane, but Norman secretly ignored his son's request. In a post- credits scene, Harry is revealed to be kept in a holding tank with a black web-like substance (possibly a Symbiote) until a cure can be found for his condition. =Other games= * The first live-action iteration of Green Goblin is one of the three villains encountered in Stern's Spider-Man Trilogy pinball machine.

Early life Torrance was born in 1805 in New York City, the son of James Torrance. His father was one of five Torrance brothers who emigrated to Canada from Lanarkshire, Scotland, early in the 19th century. His uncles, Thomas Torrance (1776‚Äì1826) and John Torrance (1786‚Äì1870), settled at Montreal as wholesale and retail grocers and winesellers. His father James went to Kingston, Upper Canada, as agent for the family. Career Around 1821, Torrance came to Montreal to work for his uncle at John Torrance and Co. In 1833, Torrance became a partner in the business of his uncle (and father-in-law), John Torrance and Co. When his John retired in 1853, the firm became David Torrance and Co., with Thomas Cramp and later his own son, John Torrance (1835‚Äì1908) as partners. With Cramp and another son, George William Torrance, he formed a second partnership in Toronto, Cramp, Torrances, and Co. The businesses traded in general goods, but especially tea. The Torrances were the first Canadians to import tea directly from China and India. When David Torrance died in 1876, the value of David Torrance and Co. in Montreal was estimated at between $400,000 and $500,000. Torrance was also a shipowner and a major shareholder in the Bank of Montreal, of which his uncle Thomas had been one of the first shareholders and a director. His uncle John succeeded Thomas and was a director of the bank until 1857, and in 1853 David Torrance joined the board. In 1873, a vacancy arose for President, and Torrance was the second longest-serving director after Senator Thomas Ryan, who declined to take on the office. The board by then included Torrance's brother-in-law, Alexander Tilloch Galt, and Torrance was elected as president. Torrance was a supporter of educational causes and in 1843 was a leading founder of the High School of Montreal. Personal life On January 9, 1832, he married his cousin Jane Torrance (1812‚Äì1875), daughter of John.

It is a tributary of the Skykomish River, which it joins at the town of Sultan, Washington. The river is dammed in its upper third by Culmback Dam to form Spada Lake. Both the Sultan River and the town of Sultan were named by prospectors for the chief of a Snohomish sub-tribe who lived on the Skykomish River in the 1870s. His name was Tsul-tad or Tseul-tud, which was anglicized by the miners into Sultan. The Sultan River's drainage basin was subjected to intense glaciation during the Pleistocene era. The river flows through a well-defined glacially carved trench. The upper South Fork Sultan River flows through a classic U-shaped valley cut by a glacier through Quartz diorite. The Sultan's river main tributaries--the North Fork, South Fork, Elk Creek, and Williamson Creek-- flow through narrow valleys to converge in the lower Sultan basin where the valley floor is relatively broad. The Sultan River exits this basin by plunging abruptly into and through a narrow canyon. Pleistocene glaciers spread down the valleys of the Sultan River and its tributaries, merging in the lower basin. From there the ice pushed west through what is now the Pilchuck River valley. Today the two rivers are separated by the terminal moraine of an ice front that spread up the Pilchuck valley and impounded the Sultan River, creating a lake. This glacial lake eventually drained westward, creating a delta moraine. The postglacial Sultan River cut through the delta moraine, establishing its present course out of the lower Sultan basin. Course The Sultan River originates at Crested Buttes. It flows northwest, then southwest into Spada Lake. Spada Lake, held back by the Culmback Dam, is the main source of drinking water for people in Everett. The South Fork Sultan River joins the main river by flowing into a large arm of the lake‚Äôs south shore. The Sultan River exits the lake and flows west, then south to its confluence with the Skykomish River. The river‚Äôs largest tributaries are Elk Creek, which joins just above where the river flows into Spada Lake, and Williamson Creek, which flows from remote Copper Lake and enters the lake just below where the river enters it. South Fork Formed at the confluence of the North Fork South Fork and Middle Fork South Fork, the South Fork Sultan River flows northwest and empties into the southern arm of Spada Lake. =North Fork South Fork= The North Fork South Fork Sultan River originates at the divide between it and Salmon Creek and flows west. It joins the Middle Fork South Fork to form the South Fork Sultan River. =Middle Fork South Fork= The Middle Fork South Fork Sultan River originates on the east slope of Mount Stickney. It flows north for about and joins the North Fork South Fork, forming the South Fork Sultan River. =South Fork South Fork= The South Fork South Fork Sultan River begins at the outlet of One Acre Lake, flows north and joins the South Fork just above its mouth on Spada Lake. History Prospecting began in the Sultan basin around 1870. Gold deposits were recovered from gravels along the lower river with small- scaler placer operations as early as 1869. Rich deposits were found in the basin some years later. In 1891 a major discovery was made--the so-called \\"45 vein\\", worked by the 45 Mine. Development depended on transportation, which came slowly. In 1896 the 45 Mine became the Sultan basin's first producer.

History James Wesley Horne Jr. was born on March 28, 1917, in Glendale, California. His father, James W. Horne, was a prolific director of both silent films and talkies, best known for his work with Laurel and Hardy, including Big Business and Way Out West. His mother, Cleo Ridgely, was an actress and a great beauty from whom, it was generally acknowledged, Horne inherited his looks. His twin sister, June, grew up to marry the actor Jackie Cooper. For about 15 years beginning in the late 1940s, Horne was ubiquitous, perhaps the most widely seen male model in the country, appearing in hundreds of advertisements in magazines and newspapers, on billboards and catalog covers, in television commercials and industrial brochures. Horne had small, sometimes uncredited parts in about two dozen films, including Gunga Din and A Place in the Sun. He auditioned for the part of Joe Bonaparte, the violinist who wants to be a boxer, in the film version of Clifford Odets's play Golden Boy, but the role went instead to another unknown actor, William Holden, who shortly thereafter became Horne's bunkmate in Army basic training. Horne served in Europe in World War II, becoming a combat photographer and earning two Bronze Stars. After returning to California, he continued to work in the movies and began modeling as well. By the early 1950s, as televisions became more common in American homes, advertisers seized on the new medium and began looking for models who could act a little. It was an opportunity that wasn't lost on Horne, and he moved to New York City, where he was soon immersed in bookings. This was an era of growth in advertising, especially on television, where many commercials were broadcast live, resulting in a lot of nuttiness. Once, as Horne performed in an ad for the hair tonic Brylcreem, his comb stuck on a thread in his pocket. When he whipped it out to slick back his pompadour, he accidentally flung it across the room. A 1953 photograph of Horne smiting his brow became an Internet meme when linking to the photograph became a popular expression for facepalming to indicate disgust or exasperation. Male models were something of a new breed, weirdly anonymous and perceived by many as suspicious or threatening; once, dressed spiffily for work and passing an hour in a bar while he waited for a photographer who was late for an appointment, Horne was badly beaten by thugs who didn't appreciate his taste in clothes. In general, male models also didn't get fabulously rich; as late as 1965, Horne's hourly rate was $50 ($ in 2010). But the job allowed him to lead the high life, traveling with pals like Mickey Mantle, whom he met at Toots Shor's restaurant, and Clark Gable, a sometime fishing companion. Horne's first marriage ended in divorce. He never had children and is survived by his wife, a former model herself, who became international director of the Barbizon School of Modeling. In 1980, under the name Francine Marlowe, she wrote Male Modeling: An Inside Look (Crown). He also leaves his last remaining blood relative, a nephew, John Cooper, of Marin County, California. Horne's modeling career continued sporadically through the 1960s, especially in print ads featuring products for \\"mature\\" men. In the mid-1960s, he became a sales manager and spokesman for an apparel company, and he later established his own business, manufacturing leather belts. Gentlemen's Quarterly In the summer of 1957, when Apparel Arts, a men's fashion magazine, decided to create a new identity for itself after more than a quarter century, it chose Horne for the cover of the magazine's first issue under its new name: Gentlemen's Quarterly. He appeared there in a jaunty striped jacket peering rakishly from behind a tropical plant. Death Although Horne died in Manhattan on December 29, 2008, his death was not published until January 24, 2009. His wife of 45 years, Francesca Marlowe Horne, said the cause was cancer, but added that he also had congestive heart failure.

It narrates the journey of the god Thor to √ötgar√∞a-Loki, a myth also preserved in Snorri Sturluson's 13th century Prose Edda part Gylfaginning. Compared with the version in Gylfaginning, the Lokrur version is often more detailed, with fleshed-out descriptions where Gylfaginning has an understated and terse text. The cycle consists of four r√≠mur, the first in and the rest in ferskeytt meter. The r√≠mur are preserved in only one medieval manuscript, Sta√∞arh√≥lsb√≥k.  Synopsis = First r√≠ma = The first verse of the first r√≠ma addresses a woman and asks her to listen to the tale. The r√≠ma then introduces the gods Odin, Thor and Loki (verses 2-5). The story starts with Thor asking Loki for his aid in meeting his namesake √ötgar√∞a-Loki (v. 6-7). Loki is reluctant, warning Thor that √ötgar√∞a-Loki is a fearsome troll (v. 8). Thor tells Loki that he will rescue him if he gets into any trouble and orders him to get ready (v. 9). Thor takes his hammer and his two goats and the journey starts (v. 10). After travelling a long distance, Thor and Loki come upon a small house with a man standing outside, offering them lodgings (v. 11-12). The farmer has two children, √ûj√°lfi and R√∂skva (v. 13). √ûj√°lfi and Thor go into the hall to talk while Loki slaughters the goats and prepares the food, which Thor then offers to the people (v. 14-15). Thor and the others eat vigorously while √ûj√°lfi breaks one of the legs to get to the marrow (v. 15-16). The next day Thor resurrects the goats with his hammer and finds that one of them has a damaged leg (17-20). Thor becomes angry, but the farmer offers him reconciliation (v. 21-23). Thor asks for √ûj√°lfi and R√∂skva as servants and the farmer agrees, both of them happy about the deal (v. 24-26). Thor leaves his goats with the farmer and goes forward on foot with his companions, walking until night falls (v. 27-28). They find a hall in a forest, large and skilfully made, with a strong roof and broad doors. It is decorated with gold (v. 29-30). They enter the hall and go to sleep (v. 30-31). = Second r√≠ma = \\"I am the giant Skrymir\\" (1902) by Elmer Boyd Smith. Thor and his companions meet Skr√≠mnir. As Thor and his companions fall asleep a strong wind starts shaking the building and the forest (v. 3-4). They get dressed again and find a small house in the middle of the hall (v. 5). Thor sits in the doorway while his companions go inside (v. 6). The next morning Thor goes outside and finds an enormous giant, described at length, sleeping by an oak, his snoring shaking the earth (v. 7-16). Thor grabs his hammer, intending to kill the giant, but just then he wakes up and startles Thor (v. 16-17). The giant sits up and heartily greets Thor and his companions (v. 18). Thor asks the giant for his name (v. 19). He tells them that he is Skr√≠mnir and asks Thor where he is going (v. 20). Thor replies that he wants to meet the king of √ötgar√∞ar (v. 21). Skr√≠mnir explains to Thor and his companions that the house they spent the night in was actually his glove and tells them they are too weak to have any business visiting √ötgar√∞a-Loki, but that he is still willing to help them get there (v. 22-26). Thor accepts and the giant ties all their provisions up in one bag (v. 27). Skr√≠mnir tells them the right way and they follow him through a forest until nightfall (v. 28-30). Skr√≠mnir selects a place for them to stay during the night and tells the others to eat while he goes and lies down (v. 30-31). Thor is unable to untie the bag with the provisions and becomes angry (v. 32-34). He throws Mj√∂llnir at the snoring giant and hits him in the head (v. 34-35). The giant wakes up and asks if some rubbish from a tree has fallen on him and whether Thor and his companions are full (v. 36-37). Thor tells him that they have eaten and asks him to go to sleep again (v. 38). The giant falls asleep and Thor makes another attempt at him with his hammer, again merely waking him up (v. 39-41). As day breaks, Thor makes a third attempt but to no avail (v. 42-44). Skr√≠mnir tells them that they are now close to √ötgar√∞a-Loki's fortress and tells them the way to go, while he himself goes north (v. 45-47). Thor and his companions now come to a great and fair fortress (v. 48). The r√≠ma ends with a traditional reference to poetry as Odin's drink (v. 49). = Third r√≠ma = As Thor and his companions approach √ötgar√∞a-Loki's fortress they face a strong locked fortress gate (v. 3-6). Unable to open it, they manage to slip through the grating between the bars (v. 7). They go into the hall and Thor greets the king (v. 8-11). √ötgar√∞a-Loki welcomes them and asks them where they come from, and whether they excel at any game or sport (v. 11-14). Loki offers to compete in eating and an opponent, Logi, is assigned to him (v. 15-16). They both eat meat ferociously, but Logi also swallows the knives and the bones and attempts to bite Loki (v. 17-20). Loki is deemed the loser and √ötgar√∞a-Loki asks for a better contestant (v. 21). √ûj√°lfi offers to compete in running and suffers a humiliating defeat against Hugi (v. 22-27). Thor and the old woman wrestle, Robert Engels (1919). Thor now wants to compete in drinking, and √ötgar√∞a-Loki has a horn carried into the hall (v. 28-30). √ötgar√∞a-Loki says that the custom is to empty the horn in one go, but Thor drinks from it three times with little success (v. 31-36). √ötgar√∞a-Loki then asks Thor to lift his cat from the ground, but despite great effort, Thor can only get one of the cat's feet off the ground (v. 37-41). √ötgar√∞a-Loki asks him to get back into his seat and tells him that he has been greatly humiliated (v. 41-44). = Fourth r√≠ma = Thor now offers to wrestle anyone who will challenge him (v. 2). √ötgar√∞a-Loki says he has a mother who once knew how to wrestle, though she is not in good health anymore (v. 3). The woman arrives, large and old, and starts wrestling with Thor (v. 4-5). Thor cannot resist her and falls to his knee (v. 5-8). The woman goes away, but Thor says he wants to go home to √Åsgar√∞r (v. 9). √ötgar√∞a- Loki says he will lead him away from the fortress and then explains to him that he has deceived him (v. 10-11). A cryptic verse explains that the bag of provisions was sealed with trickery (v. 12). When Thor threw his hammer at Skr√≠mnir, revealed to be the same person as √ötgar√∞a-Loki, the blow was blocked by a mountain or it would have killed him (v. 13). Loki lost the eating contest to fire (v. 14). The drinking horn had its end out in the sea and Thor's drinking from it has resulted in the tides (v. 15-16). The cat which Thor tried to lift was actually Mi√∞gar√∞sormr and the woman he wrestled was Elli, old age (v. 17-18). √ötgar√∞a-Loki curses the √Üsir and disappears (v. 19-20). The last verse of the cycle gives it the name Lokrur (v. 21). References=Editions= * Early Icelandic r√≠mur. (Corpus codicum Islandicorum medii aevi 11). 1938. Ed. Craigie, William A. Copenhagen.

She led a carefree life, with all the comforts of German high society, and music, singing, dancing and horseback riding were an important part of her upbringing. She was proficient in the violin and possessed a trained musical voice. In 1912, her foster parents also died and she inherited a considerable fortune from them. She moved to Odenwald, in the Schwarzwald. Here she found many poor and needy people, whom she helped financially. The loss of her parents and foster parents caused her to question the concept of the All Merciful God. She immersed herself in philosophical works and became interested in the philosophy of Buddhism. Amidst the chaos and destruction of the First World War she taught herself Meditation. In 1919, she gave shelter at her home to two German Buddhist monks, Ven Nyanatiloka (the first non-British European to become a Buddhist monk) and Ven Vappa. The former, before his ordination, had been a violinist. Their common musical background helped bring about her conversion to Buddhism.Tessa J. Bartholomeusz, Women under the Bo Tree, Cambridge University Press, 1994; , Buchholtz determined to go to Sri Lanka to renounce worldly desires, since she felt that the country's Buddhism represented the original teachings of the Buddha. In 1920, she paid for the passage of the two monks and herself to the island. However, the country was still a British colony and the three were denied entry as enemy aliens. They therefore decided to go to Japan. Here Buchholtz studied Mahayana Buddhism for five years. In 1926, she went once again to Sri Lanka and was this time allowed to enter. She was befriended by Marie Musaeus Higgins, a German Educationalist and founder of Musaeus College a school for Buddhist girls, who gave her help and encouragement. On 20 May 1926 Buchholtz was ordained a Buddhist nun beside the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi (the tree that grew from a sapling of the Bo Tree under which the Buddha attained Enlightenment) at Anuradhapura, probably by Ven. Nyanatiloka. It may have been her beautiful blue eyes which inspired her teacher to name her after Uppalavanna (\\"blue lotus\\"). Life as a nun At first Sister Uppalavanna lived in a small thatched hut close to the Vajirarama monastery in Colombo and later in Weligama.Her situation in the early 1930s describes a German visitor in: Mangelsdorf, Walter; Erlebnis Indien; Braunschweig 1950, p. 22-29; reprint [DOI 10.1007/978-3-663-02421-7] . After this she moved to a simple hermitage above the town of Gampola, in the cooler hill country. In 1938 she was invited by the Lay Committee of the Vihara Maha Devi Upasikaramaya nunnery to be chief nun. However she declined, preferring her 'little hut of palm-leaf matting' to the 'lax life of the ordinary nun's cloister'. A group of admiring and devoted benefactors, prominent amongst whom were Mrs. H.M. Gunasekera, Mrs. Nalin Moonesinghe, Lady A.M. de Silva, Mr. William Samarasinghe, Mr. H. W. Amarasuriya and Sir Lalita Rajapakse saw to her meagre needs. During the early 1950s she spent the 'vas' or rainy seasons at the Watawala Estate bungalow with Anil and Jeanne Moonesinghe. Sister Uppalavanna kept strictly to the Buddhist discipline (vinaya), observing all ten of the Buddhist precepts, (unlike most nuns, who observe only eight) in addition to the 311 rules for ordained nuns. She would cease eating lunch at midday precisely and would accept no food after that hour. Mr Gilbert, a Kandy businessman converted a rock cave called Manapadassana-lena (Cave of Pleasant View) into a habitable dwelling, which was to be her final hermitage, to reach which she had to climb 98 steps. On being informed through German diplomatic sources that she was left with a fabulous fortune in her native land, she replied 'Please do not trouble me with such information. I have no desire for anything worldly, I am striving for emancipation from greed, hatred and delusion.' When she was 94, in failing health, she was persuaded to move to the Mallika Home for the Aged, an institution established by Mallika Hewavitharana (wife of Don Carolis Hewavitharana). She died there, peacefully, two years later.

He was one of two peers suspended for six months from admittance to the House of Lords after the 2009 cash for influence scandal, the first peers to be suspended since the 17th century. Early career Thomas Taylor was born in Blackburn, the son of James and Edith Taylor. He was taught at Blakey Moor elementary school, but left aged fourteen to go to work as a shop assistant in the local Co-op. Later on he was selected as branch representative chairman of USDAW. Still only twenty-one years old Thomas Taylor married Kathleen Nurton in 1950, they had a son, Paul Taylor from their union. In 1954 he was elected to Blackburn Town Council, later becoming chairman of the education committee. In 1960 he was appointed a JP on the Blackburn bench. A Congregationalist and committed Christian, he was named president of the Free Church Council in 1963.Burke's Peerage, 107th ed., vol.III (2003) Appointed OBE in the 1969 Birthday Honours list, he was finally raised to Leader of the council from 1972‚Äì76, on the recommendation of fellow church-goer and former leader Sir George Eddie. For his services local government he was promoted to CBE in the 1974 Birthday Honours. Throughout a period of industrial decline for British textiles, Taylor gained a reputation for handling the situation sensitively by importing immigrants as cheap labour to work in the factories. His management of education was considered one of the best local authority areas in the country deploying a maximum 7% solution to the ethnic mix of local schools: to ensure social integration students were bussed across town. He became leader of education services on Lancashire County Council, as well as being Chairman of the juvenile bench. A consensual politician in the tradition of Hugh Gaitskell he steered comprehensive education through despite some concerns in the town. There he developed the Rochdale tradition of co-operative societies on the council bringing together teachers and parents on a corporatist model. He utilised the leverage of businesses to help finance educational needs by brokerage of a third way for community uses of premises out of school hours and in the holidays. He was not a particular friend of Barbara Castle the local MP who was so close to Wilson, but was delighted to influence the succession of Jack Straw to the seat on her retirement. Taylor's socialist circle included James Callaghan, so when he lost his seat on Blackburn Council in 1976 he was a natural recruit for the labour peerage. His froideur for Castle was not helped when he was asked to share an office at the House of Lords. National education and Labour governments Taylor was an acolyte of Harold Wilson. Sitting on the Public School Commission in 1958 he attacked Public Schools Headmasters Conference reluctance to relinquish their independent status. Their refusal to integrate in the comprehensive system caused Labour and Taylor to threaten class warfare for failing to modernise. In 1972 Taylor was embroiled in a row to dismiss a communist English lecturer, Dr David Craig at the new Lancaster University of which he was a co-founder and deputy Pro-Chancellor. Students staged a sit-in when the Vice-Chancellor refused to lift a threat of disciplinary action against the political agitation. Taylor was remitted to act independently but investigate the causes. Taylor's Report of July 1972 exonerated the local authority of any blame, but thought the whole case has poisoned the atmosphere and culture of the university. Craig was reinstated but outside the faculty, while the Vice- Chancellor archly refused any assistance for delegations. The following year he accused the Conservative government of a failure to invest: a creaking management had invested the system with paralysis by analysis. In his role as president of the Association of Education Committees he continued to press for more investment in schools and universities. A somewhat cynical approach was dictated by his disdain for the peerage, \\"or as third best chose a mother who has a degree.\\" He carried forward the tripartite industrial strategies of Labour's super-ministries into the new Wilsonian era, when the Education Secretary Reg Prentice asked him to report on school management. The report New Partnership for Our Schools was the first attempt to put schools on the same footing as independents by giving overall management control to a board of Governors, in co-operation with the teachers and parents. From 1977-80 he was Chairman of the Electricity Consultative Council for the North West and a member of the Board of Norweb. He served on various governmental bodies connected with education in the region, including the North West Economic Planning Council and the North West Area Health Authority. He was created a Life Peer on 4 May 1978 taking the title Baron Taylor of Blackburn, of Blackburn in the County of Lancashire. He was listed in Who's Who 2009 as a Non-executive Director of Drax Power Ltd and A Division Holdings, a Consultant to BAE Systems plc; Initial Electronic Security Systems Ltd; and an adviser to Electronic Data Systems Ltd, AES Electric Ltd, United Utilities plc, Experian and Capgemini UK plc.

He was also at various times in his career Chairman of the National Foundation for Visual Aids. Health Labour was in opposition in 1983, and Taylor was alleged to have been a likely appointment to the front bench, but his wife committed him to hospital under the Mental Health Act 1983, due to a problem with alcohol. Taylor applied for a writ of Habeas Corpus arguing that the Mental Health Act could not apply to peers when the House was sitting. After 19 days in hospital his barrister secured his release, and the case never came to court. 'Cash for Influence' scandal In late-January 2009, Taylor was one of four Labour peers accused of 'sleaze' by The Sunday Times ‚Äî it was alleged that Taylor proclaimed to two journalists posing as lobbyists that he was ready, willing and able to help a business secure favourable legislation in their sphere of interest in return for a fee reported to be in excess of ¬£100,000.Whispered over tea and cake: price for a peer to fix the law, The Sunday Times, 25 January 2009 Taylor was duped, and his behaviour exposed, by the reporter's 'sting' operation. The Conservative leader in Blackburn & Darwen demanded that the Freedom of the City Award be stripped from the former councillor. A few days later on 20 May 2009, the House of Lords considered the report of its Privileges Committee and voted to suspend Taylor and Peter Truscott for six months, the first such action since the 17th century.Lords vote to suspend two peers BBC News Expenses In 2005, Taylor claimed ¬£57,000, the second- highest level of expenses claimed in the House of Lords. He spoke 15 times in the chamber that year. Over the 2014-15 parliamentary session, Taylor claimed ¬£43,110 in expenses, including ¬£29,100 in tax-free attendance allowances. During the same parliamentary session he did not speak in the House of Lords. Taylor, then aged 86, defended his record by saying he votes regularly and only speaks on matters which he has some knowledge or experience.

Ansingh belonged to a group of female post-impressionist painters influenced by the Amsterdam Impressionism movement called the Amsterdamse Joffers. She was also a member of the (still existing) Amsterdam art circles Arti et Amicitiae and Sint Lucas. She died in Amsterdam on 14 December 1959. Biography Lizzy Ansingh was born in Utrecht. She was the daughter of Edzard Willem Ansingh, a pharmacist, and Clara Theresia Schwartze. She was the granddaughter of Johann Georg Schwartze, also a painter, and a niece of the painter Th√©r√®se Schwartze. It was her aunt Th√©r√®se Schwartze who gave Lizzy her first lessons in drawing. Lizzy lived with her aunt for 16 years. She encouraged her niece to develop her artistic career and introduced her to numerous other painters, among others French impressionists and the famous Dutch painters George Hendrik Breitner, Piet Mondriaan and Simon Maris. During the years 1894‚Äì1897 Lizzy studied at the Amsterdam Royal Academy of Visual Arts. Here she studied with the professors August Alleb√©, Nicolaas van der Waay and Carel Dake. Her work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1928 Summer Olympics. At the Academy a lasting friendship was born between a group of female painters, later called the Amsterdamse Joffers: Lizzy Ansingh, Marie van Regteren Altena, Suze Bisschop- Robertson, Coba Ritsema, Ans van den Berg, Jacoba Surie, Nelly Bodenheim, Betsy Westendorp-Osieck and Jo Bauer-Stumpff. The importance of the Amsterdamse Joffers lies primarily in functioning as role models for younger female painters in the Netherlands, especially during and after the 1970s. Other works Besides portrait painting, Ansingh gained celebrity for painting dolls, in which she was also encouraged by her aunt Th√©r√®se Schwartze. She purchased a circa 1740-1750 dollhouse (or poppenhuis) in which she arranged her dolls for inspiration, as well as furnishing it with numerous other articles she collected. Her Amsterdam studio in the Herengracht, along with the dollhouse, was severely damaged on the night of 27 April 1943 when a British bomber was shot down, destroying the Carlton Hotel and much of the alongside her studio (the ensuing fire was the most devastating in Amsterdam since 1659 and is recorded in Anne Frank's diary). The dollhouse has since been restored and can be seen at the Museum Arnhem. She also wrote two books for children, \`n Vruchtenmandje (A little fruit basket), published in 1927, and Tante Tor is jarig (Aunt Tor has her birthday). This booklet, published in 1950, was illustrated by Nelly Bodenheim.

This contrasts with diagnostic endoscopy, where the aim of the procedure is purely to visualize a part of the gastrointestinal, respiratory or urinary tract in order to aid diagnosis. In practice, a procedure which starts as a diagnostic endoscopy may become a therapeutic endoscopy depending on the findings, such as in cases of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, or the finding of polyps during colonoscopy. A number of different techniques have been developed to allow treatment to be carried out endoscopically, to treat disorders such as bleeding, strictures and polyps. Types of endoscopic therapy=Endoscopic haemostasis= Endoscopic injection of bleeding peptic ulcers with adrenaline has been practised since the 1970s, endoscopic heater probes have been used since the 1980s, and Argon plasma coagulation has been used since the 1990s. More recently, adrenaline injection tends to be combined with either heater probe coagulation or argon plasma coagulation to minimize the chance of an ulcer rebleeding. The disadvantage of this treatment is a low risk of perforation of the gastric wall and a low risk of peritonitis. Combined therapy may work better than epinephrine alone. However, there is no evidence that one kind of treatment is more effective than the other. =Injection sclerotherapy= Injection sclerotherapy has been used to treat oesophageal varices since the 1960s. A sheathed needle is passed through a channel in the endoscope, unsheathed and pushed into a varix. A sclerosing agent, such as ethanolamine or absolute alcohol, is then injected into the varix to cause scarring and constriction of the varix with the aim of obliterating the varix (or varices). This technique has now largely been superseded by variceal band ligation. Sclerotherapy has also been used in the treatment of gastric varices since the late 1980s. In this case Histoacryl glue (cyanoacrylate) is commonly used as the sclerosant. This technique is favoured over band ligation because the position of the varices in the stomach, most often in the gastric fundus, makes the placing of bands very difficult. =Argon plasma coagulation= APC of bleeding oesophageal ulcer Argon plasma coagulation (APC) has been used to provide tissue coagulation and haemostasis since the early part of the 1990s. A stream of argon gas is passed through an endoscopic catheter; this is then ionized at the tip of the catheter by an electric current. The tip of the catheter is held close to the tissue to be treated, and the current arcs across to the tissue causing a superficial (2‚Äì3 mm) burn. The lack of contact between the catheter and the tissue stops the tendency of the catheter to stick to the tissue, reducing unwanted tissue damage. Its principal use is in providing haemostasis in gastrointestinal bleeding; angiodysplasia, GAVE, bleeding malignant tumours and bleeding peptic ulcers can all be treated. Trials have also been carried out to assess its use in eradicating Barrett‚Äôs oesophagus, but have found that relapse is common. =Dilatation= Pyloric stricture dilated with endoscopic balloon Dilatation of benign oesophageal strictures using semi-rigid bougies existed long before the advent of flexible endoscopes. Since that time oesophageal dilatation has been carried out using either bougies or endoscopic balloons, and can be used to treat benign oesophageal strictures and achalasia. Initially, bougies were used to dilate benign strictures of the oesophagus. These could be passed alongside the endoscope, allowing visualisation of the bougie passing through the stricture, but the technique of passing a guidewire through the stricture endoscopically, then removing the endoscope and passing the bougie over the guidewire was more commonly used. More recently, balloon dilatation of the oesophageal strictures has become more common. It is thought that this technique carries a lower complication rate than the use of bougies, and since endoscopy balloons are single use items there are no concerns about equipment sterilization. In addition to oesophageal dilatation, endoscopic balloons can also be used to dilate pyloric strictures. =Polypectomy= Polyp is identified, snare is passed over stalk and polyp is then removed Endoscopic polypectomy has been carried out since the early 1970s by both endoscopic snare removal and fulguration of polyps with hot biopsy forceps. =Variceal banding= Oesophageal varices have been treated by band ligation since the late 1980s. Non variceal indications include bleeding peptic ulcers. Banding allows clamping of bleeding vessels and achieves mechanical sealing without affecting the ulcer's depth or size. These bands dislodge spontaneously and pass through the gastrointestinal tract safely within 3 weeks. =Stenting= Expandable metal stent Expandable mesh stents can be deployed in the oesophagus at endoscopy, primarily in patients with inoperable oesophageal cancer which is causing dysphagia. Plastic stents can also be used to relieve obstruction of the common bile duct at ERCP. =Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy= A method for inserting a feeding gastrostomy tube without the need for surgery was first described in 1980. This endoscopic technique is of particular use as many patients who require feeding tubes (such as after patients with swallowing difficulties after a stroke) are at high risk for complications from anaesthesia and surgery; the endoscopic technique usually requires mild sedation only. =Foreign body removal= Foreign bodies commonly impact in the lower oesophagus, and removal of these by pushing them into the stomach has been practised since the Middle Ages. Foreign body retrieval, using forceps and magnets, has been practised since the time of rigid oesophagoscopy and bronchoscopy. Areas under development=Anti-reflux procedures= A number of techniques are being developed for the endoscopic treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease as an alternative to laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. =Treatment of Barrett's oesophagus= Endoscopic circumferential radiofrequency ablation is being developed in an effort to obviate long-term endoscopic surveillance in patients with Barrett's oesophagus, and to reduce the risk of development of oesophageal carcinoma. Previous techniques, such as Argon plasma coagulation, have been unsuccessful because of incomplete removal of the Barrett's mucosa and therefore relapse of part of the treated area. Newer techniques using circumferential radiofrequency ablation, which allows larger areas of the oesophagus to be treated at one time giving a more uniform area of treatment, are showing more promising short-term results. =Transoral gastroplasty (TOGA procedure)= Early trials are under way to evaluate an endoscopic technique for gastric stapling, a type of bariatric surgery, which aims to induce long-term weight loss in morbidly obese patients.

Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar, 2012. intended to describe dynamics of human history involving the interaction of capitalist laws of motion and starting world market conditions whose national units are highly heterogeneous. The idea was applied systematically by Leon Trotsky around the turn of the 20th century to the case of Russia, when he was analyzing the developmental possibilities for industrialization in the Russian empire, and the likely future of the Tsarist regime in Russia.Richard B. Day and Daniel Gaido (eds.), Witnesses to Permanent Revolution: The Documentary Record. Chicago: Haymarket, 2011. The notion was then generalized and became the basis of Trotskyist politics of permanent revolution,Leon Trotsky, The Permanent Revolution which implied a rejection of the Stalinist idea that a human society inevitably developed through a uni-linear sequence of necessary \\"stages\\". Before Trotsky, Nikolay Chernyshevsky, Vasily Vorontsov, and others proposed similar ideas.Day & Gaido, op. cit., p. 27. The concept is used by Marxist scholars concerned with economic development.Bill Dunn and Hugo Radice (eds.) 100 Years of Permanent Revolution. Results and Prospects. London: Pluto Press, 2006. David Harvey is an advocate of the usefulness of this theory to reconstruct historical materialism on Modern terms. It is an accepted key concept in academic economic geography. Background Trotsky's concept was originally inspired by a series of articles by Alexander Helphand (better known as \\"Parvus\\") on \\"War and Revolution\\" in the Russian journal Iskra in 1904.Michael Lowy, The politics of Uneven and Combined Development. London: Verso, 1981. (republished by Haymarket Books in 2010). At first, Trotsky intended this concept only to describe a characteristic evolutionary pattern in the worldwide expansion of the capitalist mode of production from the 16th century onwards, through the growth of a world economy which connected more and more peoples and territories together through trade, migration and investment.Leon Trotsky, Results and Prospects His focus was also initially mainly on the history of the Russian empire, where the most advanced technological and scientific developments co-existed with extremely primitive and superstitious cultures. In the 1920s and 1930s, Trotsky increasingly generalised the concept of uneven and combined development to the whole of human history, and even to processes of evolutionary biology,\\"Talk of uneven development becomes dominant in Trotskii's writings from 1927 onwards. From this date, whenever the law is mentioned, the claim consistently made for it is that 'the entire history of mankind is governed by the law of uneven development'.\\" - Ian D. Thatcher, \\"Uneven and combined development\\", Revolutionary Russia, Vol. 4 No. 2, 1991, p. 237. as well as the formation of the human personality - as a general dialectical category. The concept played a certain role in the fierce theoretical debates during the political conflict between the supporters of Joseph Stalin and Trotsky's Left Opposition, a debate which ranged from the historical interpretation of the Russian revolution and economic strategies for the transition to socialism, to the correct understanding of principles of Marxism. =Trotsky's theory= A modern steamboat and primitive rafts in the Chilean port of Huasco in the 1850s illustrate the concept of uneven development. Different countries, Trotsky observed,Leon Trotsky, \\"Peculiarities of Russia's development\\", chapter 1 in History of the Russian Revolution, Vol. 1 developed and advanced to a large extent independently from each other, in ways which were quantitatively unequal (e.g. the local rate and scope of economic growth and population growth) and qualitatively different (e.g. nationally specific cultures and geographical features). In other words, countries had their own specific national history with national peculiarities. At the same time, all the different countries did not exist in complete isolation from each other; they were also interdependent parts of a world society, a larger totality, in which they all co-existed together, in which they shared many characteristics, and in which they influenced each other through processes of cultural diffusion, trade, political relations and various ‚Äúspill-over effects‚Äù from one country to another. Sociologically speaking, this had five main effects: * a more backward, older or more primitive country would adopt parts of the culture of a more advanced, or more modern society, and a more advanced culture could also adopt or merge with parts of a more primitive culture ‚Äì with good or bad effects. * Cultural practices, institutions, traditions and ways of life belonging to both very old and very new epochs and phases of human history were all combined, juxtaposed and linked together in a rather unusual way, within one country. * In turn, this meant that one could not really say that different societies all developed simply through the same sort of linear sequence of necessary developmental stages, but rather that they could adopt/utilize the results of developments reached elsewhere, without going through all the previous evolutionary stages which led up to those results. Some countries could thus \\"skip\\", \\"telescope\\" or \\"compress\\" developmental stages which other countries took hundreds of years to go through, or, very rapidly carry through a modernization process that took other countries centuries to achieve. * Different countries could both aid or advance the socio-economic progress of other countries through trade, subsidies and contributing resources, or block and brake other countries as competitors from making progress by preventing the use of capital, technology, trading routes, labour, land or other kinds of resources. In Trotsky's theory of imperialism, the domination of one country by another does not mean that the dominated country is prevented from development altogether, but rather that it develops mainly according to the requirements of the dominating country. For example, an export industry will develop around mining and farm products in the dominated country, but the rest of the economy is not developed, so that the country's economy becomes more unevenly developed than it was before, rather than achieving balanced development. Or, a school system is set up with foreign assistance, but the schools teach only the messages that the dominating country wants to hear. * The main tendencies and trends occurring at the level of world society as a whole, could be also found in each separate country, where they combined with unique local trends ‚Äì but this was a locally specific ‚Äúmix‚Äù, so that some world trends asserted themselves more strongly or faster, others weaker and slower in each specific country. Thus, a country could be very advanced in some areas of activity, but at the same time comparatively retarded in other areas. One effect was that the response to the same events of world significance could be quite different in different countries, because the local people attached different \\"weightings\\" to experiences and therefore drew different conclusions. According to Trotsky, the unequal and combined development of different countries had an effect on the class structure of society. *For example, the Russian empire in 1917 was largely a peasant society composed of many different nationalities and governed by an absolutist state headed by the Czar; popular democracy did not exist. *A process of industrialization had begun in the main cities since Peter the Great (for example, the Putilov steel works established in Petrograd - where the February 1917 revolution began, with a strike - was the largest in the world at the time). But this urban industrialization process relied mainly on the investment of foreign capital from France, Britain and other countries, and was limited to some urban areas and regions. *The Russian bourgeoisie which developed under the tutelage of the Czarist state lacked much power, and was politically weak. The bourgeoisie was unable to establish political democracy. At the same time, a militant industrial working class developed in the main cities, concentrated in large factories and plants. *In this way, the archaic culture of primitive peasant production and a semi-feudal state combined with the culture of modern industrial society. Trotsky believed that this would shape the unique character of the Russian revolution. Namely, the Russian bourgeoisie was politically too weak and too dependent on the Czarist state to challenge its autocratic rule, and therefore the revolution against Czarist rule would be spearheaded by the revolt of urban workers. Thus, the political and modernizing tasks normally associated in Europe with the leadership of the rising bourgeoisie, such as fighting for popular democracy and civil rights against absolutism, land ownership reform, industrializing the country, and national self-determination for oppressed nationalities, would have to be carried out in the Russian empire under the leadership of working-class parties, in particular the Russian Social-Democratic Labor Party which had been outlawed (although there were several other socialist, nationalist and liberal parties). In the chaos towards the end of the First World War, in which Russian soldiers fought against the imperial German army, this political assessment proved largely correct. The provisional government established by the February revolution in 1917 collapsed and the October revolution, in which the Russian Marxists played a dominant role, destroyed Czarist state power completely. Thereafter, the Russian bourgeoisie was largely expropriated; most businesses then fell under state ownership. A new stage in Trotsky's understanding of uneven and combined development in world history was reached in his analyses of fascism and populism in Germany, France, Spain and Italy.Leon Trotsky, The struggle against fascism in Germany, introduced by Ernest Mandel. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1975. Leon Trotsky, The Spanish Revolution 1931-1939. New York: Pathfinder Press, 1975. Leon Trotsky, On France. New York: Pathfinder, 1979. Leon Trotsky, Fascism: What It Is and How to Fight It. New York: Pathfinder 1969. Trotsky makes it clear, the human progress is not a linear, continuously advancing process of bourgeois modernization - progress can also be reversed or undone, and ancient cults, superstitions or barbarous traditions can be revived, even although nobody previously thought that was possible. =Rudolf Hilferding's theory= Around the time that Trotsky settled in Vienna as a journalist in exile, after escaping from Siberia a second time, the Austro-Marxist Rudolf Hilferding wrote his famous book Finance Capital (first published in 1910) in which Hilferding mentions an idea very similar to Trotsky's. The passage occurs in chapter 22 on \\"the export of capital and the struggle for economic territory\\". It has never been proved whether Hilferding was influenced in any way by what Trotsky had written, although it is known they corresponded with each other,Rudolf Hilferding Papers, International Institute of Social History, Amsterdam. but Hilferding's own analysis of \\"the latest phase of capitalist development\\" certainly influenced a whole generation of socialist leaders.F. Peter Wagner, Rudolf Hilferding: theory and politics of democratic socialism. Atlantic Highlands, N.J. : Humanities Press, 1996. In any case similar notions were widespread among socialists throughout Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe at this time. Among other things, Hilferding states: > The export of capital, especially since it has assumed the form of > industrial and finance capital, has enormously accelerated the overthrow of > all the old social relations, and the involvement of the whole world in > capitalism. Capitalist development did not take place independently in each > individual country, but instead capitalist relations of production and > exploitation were imported along with capital from abroad, and indeed > imported at the level already attained in the most advanced country. Just as > a newly established industry today does not develop from handicraft > beginnings and techniques into a modern giant concern, but is established > from the outset as an advanced capitalist enterprise, so capitalism is now > imported into a new country in its most advanced form and exerts its > revolutionary effects far more strongly and in a much shorter time than was > the case, for instance, in the capitalist development of Holland and > England.Rudolf Hilferding, Finance Capital. A Study of the Latest Phase of > Capitalist Development. London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1981, pp. 322-23. Hilferding's insight was rarely noticed by English-speaking Marxists.Marcel van der Linden, \\"The 'Law' of Uneven and Combined Development: Some Underdeveloped Thoughts\\". Historical Materialism, Volume 15, Number 1, 2007, pp. 145-165. His book Finance Capital, which went out of print several times, was never translated into English until 1981 (i.e. 70 years later). After the publication of Lenin's classic interpretation of imperialism as the highest (and final) stage of capitalism in 1917, most Marxist writers based their analyses of imperialism on Lenin's book. Even though, on several occasions throughout the book, Lenin cites Hilferding approvingly, by the time that Hilferding became Finance Minister in Germany in 1923, the Marxist‚ÄìLeninists regarded him as a reformist renegade, and his analyses were no longer trusted or taken seriously. William Smaldone, Rudolf Hilferding: The Tragedy of a German Social Democrat. DeKalb: Northern Illinois University Press, 1998. Contemporary applications The idea of uneven and combined development, as formulated by Trotsky, as well as Lenin's \\"law\\" of uneven economic and political development under capitalism are still being used today, especially in academic studies of international relations, archaeology, anthropology and development economics, as well as in discussions of the Trotskyist movement. Such International relations schools as the world-systems theory and dependency theory have been both influenced by Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism and Trotsky's writings on the subject. =Economic geography= Geography has produced influential scholarship on the idea of uneven development. Geography started to lean left politically before the 1970sSmith, Neil. Preface to the second edition of, Uneven Development: Nature, Capital and the Production of Space, xi-xiii. Georgia:University of Georgia Press. 2008. resulting in a particular interest in questions of inequality and uneven development (UD). UD has since become somewhat of a homegrown theory in Geography as geographers have worked to explain what causes inequality within different scales of space, locally, nationally and internationally. Key scholars in this field include Doreen Massey, Neil Smith and David Harvey. Uneven development results from the \\"spatially and temporally uneven processes and outcomes that are characteristic, and functional to capitalism\\".Gregory, Derek, Ron Pratt, and Geraldine Pratt. Dictionary of Human Geography. 5th Edition. Hoboken: Wiley-Blackwell, 2009. Online. *Much of neoclassical economic theory holds that features of unevenness, such as income inequality, equalizes as a result of capital diffusion throughout the open market. *Proponents argue that investment liberalization allows foreign capital to invest in capital-poor countries, yielding the highest rates of return, and that global integration promotes competitive advantage. *Neoclassical theory contends that newly globalized, liberalized and capitalized developing countries have the added advantage over developed countries in that they are able to draw on existing markets, capital flow regimes and technologies.Harris, Donald. ‚ÄúUneven Development.‚Äù The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics. Second Edition. Eds. Steven N. Durlauf and Lawrence E. Blume. Palgrave Macmillan, 2008. This has the effect of placing all countries on an even playing field. The result is a global economy in equilibrium, or in other words, convergence. As such, in the neoclassical view, uneven development is merely an interim stage of economic development that can be erased by the free market.Gregory, Derek, Ron Pratt, and Geraldine Pratt. Dictionary of Human Geography. 5th Edition. Hoboken: Wiley-Blackwell, 2009. Online. Marxist geographers, on the other hand, assert that uneven development is persistently produced and reproduced by capital diffusion, and therefore, is an inherent and permanent feature of capitalism.Gregory, Derek, Ron Pratt, and Geraldine Pratt. Dictionary of Human Geography. 5th Edition. Hoboken: Wiley-Blackwell, 2009. Online. Unlike the neoliberal contention of the erasure of disparities towards convergence, Marxists maintain that capital accumulation depends on differential economic climates for its regeneration. Harvey states that accumulation \\"is the engine which powers growth under the capitalist mode of production. The capitalist system is therefore highly dynamic and inevitably expansionary\\".Harvey, David. ‚ÄúThe Geography of Capitalist Accumulation: A Reconstruction of the Maxian Theory.‚Äù Antipode. 7.2 (1975): 9-21. The dynamism of capitalism is due to its persistent search for competitive advantage and consequently, its movement away from oversaturated economies towards new spaces from which it can extract greater profit. For instance, developed economies are characterized by high land rents and wages, and unionized labour, translating into high costs of production and lower gains. By contrast, developing economies have abundant pliable labour, and low rents and wages.Gregory, Derek, Ron Pratt, and Geraldine Pratt. Dictionary of Human Geography. 5th Edition. Hoboken: Wiley-Blackwell, 2009. Online. As such, it is favourable for capital investments to move into the latter economy from the former in the interest of gaining greater rates of return. Kiely argues that capital diffusion throughout the global market remains a highly uneven process marked by reversals of comparative advantage and by cycles of investment and disinvestment, having the effect of elevating some spaces while simultaneously marginalizing others.Kiely, Ray. ‚ÄúSpatial Hierarchy and/or Contemporary Geopolitics: What Can and Can‚Äôt Uneven and Combined Development Explain?‚Äù Cambridge Review of International Affairs. 25.2 (2012): 231-248. Differential economic environments have material effects on the ground. Processes of capital accumulation through space and time create new geographic landscapes shaped by crisis, deindustrialization and capital flight on the one hand, and influxes of capital and industrialization on the other. Capitalism not only reshuffles core-periphery relations, but rather, as Smith claims, it also penetrates all geographic scales.Smith, Neil. ‚ÄúThe Restructuring of Spatial Scale and the New Global Geography of Uneven Development.‚Äù Jinbun Chiri. 28 (2000): 51-66. At the urban scale, differential rent gaps trigger investment and disinvestment in particular neighborhoods driving gentrification.Smith, Neil. ‚ÄúThe Restructuring of Spatial Scale and the New Global Geography of Uneven Development.‚Äù Jinbun Chiri. 28 (2000): 51-66.Gregory, Derek, Ron Pratt, and Geraldine Pratt. Dictionary of Human Geography. 5th Edition. Hoboken: Wiley-Blackwell, 2009. Online. On the global scale, integrated economies provoke time-space compression enabling enhanced communication and capital mobility. Smith argues that the subsequent erosion of the nation scale as the primary agent created a pivotal link between the global and urban scales. Since the 1990s, the increasingly integrated global economy has given greater importance to the role of the city. Indeed, world city building has become the geographical force of capitalism. New spaces of accumulation in Asia, Latin America and Africa are gaining competitive advantage as new centres of command and control and of surplus capital.Smith, Neil. ‚ÄúThe Restructuring of Spatial Scale and the New Global Geography of Uneven Development.‚Äù Jinbun Chiri. 28 (2000): 51-66. Other elements of neoliberal thought such as reducing the \\"left arm\\" of the state including welfare and support for the poor create even bigger inequalities between residents of the same areas, also resulting in uneven development. Tom Nairn and the revival of nationalism Marxist historian Tom Nairn has argued that uneven development can also lead to peripheral nationalism, for example in Scotland.Paul James and Tom Nairn (eds.), Global Matrix: Nationalism, Globalism and State-terrorism. London: Pluto, 2005. Peripheral regions tend to promote nationalist movements when regional inequalities overlap with ethnic differences, or when membership of a larger state no longer presents advantages. In underdeveloped regions, nationalist movements mobilise the population against the persistence of ethnic economic inequality. Helena Norberg-Hodge and uneven development in Northern India Helena Norberg-Hodge is an economist who spent more than 30 years in Ladakh. She argues that uneven development and crises often affect people now because of past economic activities. To solve the problem, the fundamental economic approach needs change from \\"globalizing\\" to \\"localizing\\". Localization can contribute to reduce CO2 emission, solve the economic problems, and restore biodiversity as well as cultural diversity. Localizing is one of the ways to create secure jobs in the global population. Norberg- Hodge based her argument on her experience of witnessing changes in Ladakh, before and after the region was subsidized to enhance economic activities and promote development. The subsidies meant that products from thousands of miles away could be sold cheaper than locally made products, which destroyed the local market. It quickly lead to unemployment and religious strife. Norberg- Hodge raised critical questions about the effects of spending on infrastructure (such as roads) intended to stimulate the economy and reduce costs, in order to achieve greater social wellbeing. The point is, that the globalized economy enables people to control other places from a far distance, without knowing the situation in the region. Large investments subsidizing the transportation system make products from thousands of miles away cheaper than locally made products. Rather than improving the local community, the local market collapses and local people lose their jobs, while investors far away make a lot of profit from business ventures that create more unequal development than there was before.Keiner M., The Future of Sustainability.

The plateau surface of the hill rises to a height of 440m at OS grid ref SN 806297 where a trig point has been erected.Ordnance Survey Explorer map OL12 'Brecon Beacons National Park: western area' Geology The hill is composed of a variety of different rock formations all tilted steeply to the southeast in a structure known as the Myddfai Steep Belt. The summit ridge is formed from sandstones and mudstones of the Cae'r Mynach Formation. Immediately southeast of these beds is the narrow band of the Tilestones Formation along which are a line of grassed over diggings left after these flaggy micaceous sandstones were extracted for use as roof tiles. Southeast again is the thick sequence of the Raglan Mudstone Formation.

He was found murdered in his Washington, D.C. apartment on June 1, 1981. The murder is still unsolved.D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, Unsolved Murder Handbill, Raymond Nels Nelson, May 30, 2007 Life Born into a large working class Swedish family, Nelson didn't speak English until the age of 6. His twin brother, Ralph Hilmer, died of spinal meningitis in 1930. Nelson began his career at The Providence Journal as a typist after his honorable discharge from the Navy. After rising to bureau chief he was tapped to join the staff of future Senator Claiborne Pell. Nelson managed Pell's first Senate campaign in 1960. Pell, considered a long-shot, became the first unendorsed aspirant to win a statewide primary in Rhode Island. When Pell was elected, Nelson went to Washington DC as his Administrative Assistant (AA). Commenting on the folly of staking his career on an unknown candidate, Nelson said: \\"There is absolutely nothing like being right when everybody thinks you're wrong,\\" and called the campaign \\"the most fun I ever had.\\" (Providence Journal-Bulletin, June 2, 1981). In a 1971 interview in the Sunday Journal, Nelson prided himself on Pell's Senate office's open door policy and college intern program, at the time the largest and most active on the Hill. The article declared Nelson as \\"‚Ä¶a nice guy and a tough guy, and he knows when to be which.\\" (Providence Journal-Bulletin, June 2, 1981). Nelson's influence on the early drafting of Federally funded college aid, later known as 'The Pell Grants', is detailed in G. Wayne Miller's biography on Pell, An Uncommon Man: \\"I don't believe he ever considered going to college,\\" his son, David C. Nelson, recalled. \\"He had both admiration and disdain for higher education, believing he was as smart as any college graduate. This may have been a class thing, because he identified himself as a 'peasant', and my grandfather referred to the 'upper crust' as 'a bunch of crumbs held together by a little dough'. They almost lost their home several times during the Depression and were very traumatized during that period.\\" \\"Recognizing the complexities of the new world that his children would inherit convinced Nelson of the value of a college degree, and he brought that perspective to his boss in their discussions. Like Pell, Nelson saw a model in the G.I. Bill.\\" (Page 156, An Uncommon Man) In 1974 Nelson abruptly left Pell's office and joined the staff of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration. Pell appointed another member of his staff, Paul Goulding, as his new AA. (Providence Journal-Bulletin, April 10, 1974). Nelson was seemingly a happily married family man with three children and a home in Bethesda, Maryland. In 1976, he openly declared himself a gay man and left his suburban home to live in the city. He remained good friends with his wife, whom he never divorced, and maintained contact with his children. Death Nelson was found murdered amid scattered newspapers and magazines in his apartment near Catholic University in Washington D.C. at 701 Quincy Street, NE, on June 1, 1981. The reported murder weapon was a large office typewriter. On the floor of the Senate, the day after the murder, Senator Pell said: \\"There is probably no other Senate employee known to more of us than Ray (Nelson). The respect and affection with which he was regarded by his colleagues was shown when he was selected to serve as president of the Senate Staff Club, and last year was presented the Distinguished Service Award by the Congressional Staff Club 'for his long time service in every facet of Senate life.' He also served as Senate Chairman for the Combined Federal Campaign.\\" (The Congressional Record, Vol. 127, No. 82, June 2, 1981.) In a Washington Post article the day after the murder, Pell also said \\"Ray Nelson was a dear and old friend of my wife and me, as well as an associate who worked with me for many years. I grieve with and for his wife and children.\\"[2] Before police sealed Nelson's apartment and office, a Senate staff member was allowed entry to remove 'sensitive' documents, thereby compromising evidence. Family members, with Nelson the night before his slaying, were not interviewed by police. Decades later, police revealed the crime scene had been staged and called the investigation \\"faulty police work\\". In November 1981, Wilmot Robertson wrote that Washington police had \\"clamped a lid of total secrecy\\" over the murder.

In 1966, he set up one of the world's first air courier companies. He was also instrumental in founding the Association of International Courier and Express Services (AICES) and later the Association of European Express Carriers. Through this and his membership of the International Express Carriers Conference (IECC) he worked steadfastly to dispel the 'cowboy' image of the courier industry and promote it as a respected worldwide enterprise on which the business community could depend. He was a recognised expert on the complexities of international customs procedures for express shipments and worked tirelessly to achieve parity of treatment with postal administrations. He contributed valuable input to the European Commission in formulating its Paper on Community Postal Policy, ensuring that it was aware of the courier industry's interests. This helpfully reinforced the line which the Department of Trade and Industry took with the Commission. Having left school in 1941, Bertie Coxall joined the RAF and was commissioned as a navigator, serving in Canada and the Middle East. On demobilisation in 1947 he joined LEP as a Customs Entry Clerk and remained there for 20 years, through LEP's takeover first by American Airlines and then by Pan American Airways (Pan Am), rising to managerial level. In 1966, finding he could not progress in Pan Am without emigrating to the United States, he resigned to form his own company, Airport Courier Services Ltd (ACSL), providing document transmission by motorcycle within the Heathrow area between freight agents and airlines. In 1969, he expanded operations by sending an employee daily to Paris and back. This innovative air courier service was gradually extended to other destinations across the world. Relaxation of the postal monopoly for time-sensitive items in 1981 brought the rapid expansion of the courier industry. Realising that an independent company could not compete with the giants, he sold ACSL to Securicor in 1982, continuing as its Managing Director under a 5-year contract. He remained a Non-Executive Director of Securicor Omega Express (formerly Securicor Express International) and that consultative role enabled him to give more time to the courier industry as a whole. He was a member of the IECC's Executive Committee since its formation in 1984 and in 1989 he became inaugural Chairman of the Association of European Express Carriers (AEEC). Having served twice as the chairman of the Association of Courier and Express Services (AICES), he was elected Honorary Life-President in 1985 in recognition of his work for the Association and for the courier industry as a whole.

Robinson served as chairman of the Chicago Housing Authority under the leadership of former Chicago Mayor Harold Washington from August 1983 until January 1987. He is most known for founding the African American Patrolman's League. During his career as a police officer, Robinson was responsible for bringing a civil rights lawsuit against the Chicago Police Department for discrimination against minorities (African-Americans and Latinos). Biography Born in Chicago, to Mabel and Robert Robinson, he graduated from Hyde Park High School (now Hyde Park Academy High School) in 1960. =Chicago Police Department= Robinson joined the Chicago Police Department in 1964, and was involved in providing police protection for the September 4, 1966, march on Cicero, Illinois. In 1968 Robinson co-founded the Chicago Police Department's Afro-American Patrolmen‚Äôs League (Later known as the Afro American Police League and now known as the African American Police League), an organization aimed at improving police service to the black community and at getting more blacks into policymaking positions in the department.TIME Magazine: The Anguish of Blacks in Blue The formation of the AAPL led to an increase in minority officers and civil rights lawsuits against the CPD for the discrimination of African American and Hispanic citizens. It also was a costly move for Robinson. Before the founding of the AAPL, Robinson was considered a model policeman with a 97% efficiency rating and had won more than 50 citations for outstanding police work. After the founding of the AAPL, Robinson and other members were often suspended, brought up on charges for minor infractions, reassigned to less desirable positions and threatened with dismissal from the police force as the CPD hoped to dismantle the organization. Robinson nevertheless remained on the force and spoke out against racism in the police department criticizing events such as a raid that resulted in the murder of Black Panther Party member Fred Hampton Police and Panthers at War and a dragnet operation ran by infamous Chicago police commander Jon Burge that resulted in a military-like occupation of Chicago's South Side.Police Torture In Chicago: House of Screams Despite the hardships in the department Robinson however was backed by Harold Washington, a member of the Illinois House of Representatives who would become Chicago's first African American mayor. =Chicago Housing Authority = In August 1983, Robinson resigned from the police force when he was appointed to chair the Chicago Housing Authority by newly elected African-American Mayor Harold Washington. During his first few months as chairman, He made a number of controversial decisions. He was criticized for the firing of the authority's elevator mechanics and maintenance personal without having adequate replacements; which caused problems for residents living in high-rise buildings. In October, Robinson was stripped of day-to day authority for many reasons; but notably for the hiring friends, relatives and associates in top authority positions.

Etymology The specific name, belliana, is in honor of English zoologist Thomas Bell.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Leiolepis belliana, p. 22). Geographic range L. belliana can be found in the forests of Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. Description L. belliana is known for the beautiful patterns on its back and sides. It has yellow spots on its back, and small orange and black lines on its sides. Introduced species L. belliana has been introduced into the United States, in Florida. It seems to have an established population there. Habitat L. belliana lives on land that has been prepared for agricultural uses, as well as open sandy land along the coasts.  Ecology = Reproduction = L. belliana is monogamous, with a single adult pair inhabiting the same burrow, where 3-8 eggs are laid during hot, dry weather. This species is also exhibits parental care of neonates, with neonates sharing their parents' burrow for a few months before digging their own burrow nearby. = Diet = Butterfly Lizards feed on vegetation, crabs, grasshoppers, beetle larvae, butterflies, and other insects. = Habitat = Leiolepis belliana digs and lives in a burrow ca. 30 cm deep and 70 cm long, to which it returns before dark, and uses its flattened body to seal the entrance to protect it from nocturnal predators. These burrows are also used during reproduction and as refuge from weather and fires.  Invasion of Florida  The Miami population of Leiolepis belliana originated from a tropical fish dealer and the population was already well established in 1992. Leiolepis belliana is readily available in the pet trade, and reptile collectors are probably not exploiting the Miami population because this species is located on private properties in a residential area, difficult to catch, and not worth much as individuals typically wholesale for $3.50‚Äì5.50 each. The ecological impacts of L. belliana on native species in Florida are unknown.

The station was opened by the Bristol and Portishead Pier and Railway Company on 18 April 1867. It had two platforms, on either side of a passing loop, with a goods yard and signal box later additions. Services increased until the 1930s, at which point a half-hourly service operated. However the Portishead Branch was recommended for closure by the Beeching report, and the station was closed on 7 September 1964, although the line saw freight traffic until 1981. Regular freight trains through the station began to run again in 2002 when Royal Portbury Dock was connected to the rail network. The station is due to be reopened to passenger traffic as part of MetroWest, a scheme to increase rail services in the Bristol area. The new station will have a single platform, an accessible footbridge and a car park, with trains running between and Bristol.  History  A train crosses the Pill Viaduct in 1960. This is a service from Portishead, which has just left Pill. Pill railway station was opened on 18 April 1867 by the Bristol and Portishead Pier and Railway Company, when services began on their line from the Bristol and Exeter Railway at Portishead Junction to a pier on the Severn Estuary at . The station served the village of Pill on the south bank of the River Avon. The line was built as broad- gauge, and was largely single track. The station was sited in a cutting close to the old centre of Pill, from the line's terminus at Portishead, from and from the Great Western Railway's terminus at .Railways in the United Kingdom are, for historical reasons, measured in miles and chains. There are 80 chains to the mile. To the east, the railway passed through the village and crossed a valley on the brick-built Pill Viaduct, while to the west the line was largely through flat, open countryside. The station was initially the second along the line from Portishead Junction, after and before . The station at Pill was aligned roughly north-west/south-east, with the line bridged to the east by Station Road and Myrtle Hill. There were two platforms, separated by two running lines, forming a passing loop. The southern \\"down\\" platform was for trains towards Portishead, the northern \\"up\\" platform for trains towards Bristol. Each platform was provided with a brick shelter and steps up to Station Road. The station building was sited on Station Road, west of the platforms. There were initially six trains per day in each direction on weekdays and one on Sundays, operated by the Bristol and Exeter Railway. The Great Western took over the Bristol and Exeter in 1876, and in 1884 took over ownership of the Bristol and Portishead. Services increased to nine trains per day on weekdays by 1889. The line was relaid as standard gauge in 1880, coinciding with a lengthening of the platforms, and by 1909 there were 13 trains per day on weekdays and two trains on Sundays. The double track loop through the station was extended at both ends in March 1912, with the platforms also extended. A small goods yard and coal depot was built at the north-west end of the station at the same time. A signal box was built on the southern platform at the end of the First World War. By 1929, services had increased to 21 trains per day on weekdays and eight per day on Sundays. This allowed a train every half-hour, with one train per hour running to Bristol Temple Meads and the other terminating at . Passenger traffic was mainly commuters, to both Bristol and Portishead, as well as people who wished to use the Pill ferry across the river to Shirehampton. During the Second World War, many evacuees from Bristol commuted into the city from Pill. The station staff at this time consisted of a station master, two porters and two female signallers. When the railways were nationalised in 1948, Pill came under the aegis of the Western Region of British Railways. Passenger services had reduced by 1949 to 13 trains per day on weekdays and seven on Sundays. In 1963 the Beeching report suggested the complete withdrawal of services along the line as a cost-saving measure, and so goods services at Pill were ended on 10 June 1963; with the station closing completely on 7 September 1964. In the final year of operation, there were only six trains on weekdays and none on Sundays. Freight trains continued to pass through the station, but their number decreased over time, and the line fell out of regular use after 30 March 1981. The line however was kept intact by British Rail, with occasional freight trains, and in 2002 a single track was relaid to allow rail access to Royal Portbury Dock, which brought regular freight traffic. At this time remnants of both platforms could be seen and the station buildings were in commercial use.  Future  A computer rendering of how a reopened Pill railway station would look, as seen from the south. The Portishead Branch Line is to be reopened as part of the MetroWest scheme, a rail transport plan which aims to enhance transport capacity in the Bristol area. The scheme was given the go-ahead in July 2012 as part of the City Deal, whereby local councils would be given greater control over money by the government. There had been calls for the line to reopen, primarily due to traffic congestion on the A369, which is the only route from Portishead to Bristol. A consultation on the reopening plans was held between 22 June and 3 August 2015 to gather views from the community and stakeholders before moving on to detailed designs. Due to the additional capital costs, the line will not be electrified, however the design will include passive provision for future electrification. In April 2019 the Department for Transport committed ¬£31.9m to cover the shortfall in finance for MetroWest Phase 1, meaning that funding has now been secured. In November 2019 North Somerset Council submitted a Development Consent Order (DCO) application to the Planning Inspectorate, which seeks powers to build and operate the disused section of railway from Portishead to Pill, gain environmental consent to undertake works to the existing freight railway through the Avon Gorge and obtain powers for the compulsory acquisition of land. The Secretary of State for Transport is expected to make a decision within 18 months. Subject to final business case approval, construction work is expected to start on the line in December 2021 and then take around two years to complete. As part of the works, Pill station will be reopened. Trains both to and from will use the southern platform, which will be resurfaced and provided with a waiting shelter, lighting, passenger information displays and audible announcements. The northern platform, adjacent to the current single track line to Royal Portbury Dock, will not be reinstated, however the track will be retained for freight trains. The two tracks will have a junction east of the station. Initial plans for the station were for access to be from Monmouth Road, which runs parallel to the railway, north of the line. There was to be a fully accessible footbridge across the line, with both ramp and stairs, as well as a pedestrian crossing across Monmouth Road and a lit 50-space car park on the old goods yard at the eastern end of Monmouth Road. The very end of the goods yard would be maintained for Network Rail access. These plans were changed following an agreement to acquire a property on Station Road. The new plans have the entrance to be on Station Road, at the east end of the site, meaning there would be no need for a footbridge. There would be disabled parking and a pick up/drop off point adjacent to the entrance, although the exact design of this area is still under consideration. Noise mitigation options are to be investigated and there will be improvements to local footpaths. It is expected that reopening the station will result in reduced car usage to and from Pill and the surrounding villages. Most station users will walk to the station, with the next largest share being car drivers and car passengers being dropped off, followed by cyclists and bus users. Some parking restrictions are proposed to prevent rail users parking on the local streets, which are narrow and not suitable for widening. Trains along the reopened line will operate between Portishead and , with two trains per hour in each direction. Services would call at Pill and , with aspirations to also call at and a reopened . Trains could also be extended on to the Severn Beach Line. The trains used will be diesel multiple units, likely three carriages long. The line will be operated as part of the Greater Western passenger franchise. Great Western Railway, a subsidiary of FirstGroup, currently operate the Greater Western franchise, however their present contract expires before services to Portishead are likely to start.

Philosophy Culture and philosophy: in his book Traditions of Compassion (Palgrave, 2006), Lampert offers an analysis of the concept of \\"compassion\\" in three cultures for which the term \\"compassion\\", is an inherent part of their self-image: Christian-Catholic culture, which developed a narrative of compassion in the sense of participation in agony (of Christ), complementary and contrasting the biblical narrative; Buddhist tradition, where compassion appears as a universal tendency to prevent suffering, and as a state of consciousness closely related to enlightenment; and the secular modern European tradition which demands social responsibility and state-welfare as a substitute to religious compassion. Lampert's analysis demonstrates how the ideological history of each of these traditions, teaches the distancing and restraining of compassion, to the point where it almost impossible to legitimize a compassionate action. The critical analysis indicates how each of these three traditions, not only did not fulfill its \\"promise of compassion\\" and its obligation for the welfare of the weak in society, but actually served as a basis for rejection and exclusion. In light of these comparative analyzes, Lampert offers his \\"Theory of Radical-Compassion\\" ‚Äì radical- compassion is an empathic state of consciousness that generates the imperative for the praxis of change and combat other's suffering. According to Lampert, Radical Compassion is a natural tendency of human organism, which has been historically oppressed by culture (as opposed to common cultural theories, e.g. the Freudian perception of natural tendencies as primarily selfish, and the understanding of empathy as a superimposition of culture). Philosophy of education: in his book Empathic education ‚Äì a critique of neo-capitalism (published in Hebrew 2008), Lampert extends his social criticism. He analyses the post-modern education system and argues that social exclusion, alienation and failure is an inherent part of a social reproduction ideology. The critical analysis reveals the gap between the smug self-image of those engaged in education, and the harsh and violent face of the system, of which teachers are victims as much as students. As an alternative, Lampert offers a return to the roots of educational practice; i.e. the human-encounter based on our natural empathy, especially in its radical form. This type of resistance, means a radical change in school, that like other cultural institutions, is built to keep us all away from authentic human encounter.

The Bullets adopted the \\"Capital\\" name for the 1973‚Äì74 season after leaving Baltimore for the immediate Washington area. In that season, they played their first few home games at Cole Field House on the University of Maryland campus in College Park before their new home, the Capital Centre in Landover, Maryland, opened in December 1973.

She is currently President of the cycling team. She was previously the President and Chief Executive Officer of New York Road Runners (NYRR) through May 18, 2015. Wittenberg oversaw the TCS New York City Marathon and several other races, events, and programs that draw over 300,000 yearly participants. Under Wittenberg's leadership, NYRR helped develop new initiatives such as the World Marathon Majors Series and several community programs that have introduced running to underprivileged children. For her efforts related to the TCS New York City Marathon, an article in the New York Times stated that Wittenberg \\"has transformed the New York City Marathon from traditional to competitive to innovative.\\" A former competitive runner, Wittenberg won the 1987 Marine Corps Marathon. She participates in many NYRR races. Early life Wittenberg was born in Buffalo, New York, and raised in a large and athletic Irish Catholic family. She was the oldest of seven children, and played softball, baseball and basketball‚Äîsports that her father coached. In high school, she focused on cheerleading, and also starred on a champion West Side Rowing Club team. Wittenberg went on to attend Canisius College, and was a coxswain for the men's crew team that won a championship for small colleges. During her senior year in College, Wittenberg took up running. She won a few local races and trained with Canisius' men's cross country team. Wittenberg also trained with the men's cross country team while attending law school at University of Notre Dame. While training with this group, she finished 16th at the Chicago Marathon with a time of 2:46. After law school, Wittenberg moved to Richmond, Virginia to work for the Hunton & Williams law firm. She would spend busy days working in the office, marathon training with the University of Richmond cross country team, and studying to pass the bar. In 1987, she won the Marine Corps Marathon in a time of 2:44:34. Wittenberg used a late surge to overtake the leaders in the second half of the race. Wittenberg's strong performance at the Marine Corps Marathon qualified her for the 1988 Olympic marathon trials. However, she soon required surgery for a knee injury, and a back ailment forced her to drop out of the qualifying race. Wittenberg ran in only two more marathons due to injuries and a focus on her law career. New York Road Runners=CEO= In the early 1990s, Wittenberg worked as an attorney who specialized in international trade deals for U.S. banks. In 1994, her firm transferred her to New York City. It was there that she was made a partner for her law firm. However, in 1998 Wittenberg opted for a career change, as she wanted to devote time to start a family. Despite taking a significant pay cut, Wittenberg began work for New York Road Runners as Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Her initial responsibilities ranged from overseeing NYRR publications to administering membership and race scoring. She helped secure the deal that made ING a title sponsor for the race. In 2005, Wittenberg was named President and Chief Executive of NYRR, and became the first female director of a major international marathon. NYRR administers the TCS New York City Marathon. Under Wittenberg's leadership, a significant change was made for women marathoners to receive more prize money than their male counterparts. NYRR's budget has increased significantly, as has the viewership for the TCS New York City Marathon. NYRR and Wittenberg also administered the 2008 U.S. Men's Marathon Olympic Trials. During this event, former collegiate star Ryan Shay suffered a heart attack and died while competing in the race. Wittenberg's sensitive handling of the tragic news at the post-race press conference was cited as an example of her \\"class and compassion\\". =Running= While CEO of NYRR, Wittenberg spearheaded innovative programs to increase running's popularity as a spectator sport. The NYRR has partnered with five other major marathons (London, Boston, Berlin, Chicago and Tokyo) to create the World Marathon Majors Series. Runners compete in these races to earn a cumulative standing, similar to NASCAR's Sprint Cup. NYRR also provides financial support for the USA Distance Project, which is composed of training groups throughout the country for post-collegiate distance runners. As of November 2009, the NYRR have donated $750,000 to the Distance Project in a three-year span. After Meb Keflezighi's victory and five other American men finishing in the top ten of the 2009 New York Marathon, Wittenberg was very optimistic about the future of U.S. men's distance running. She said \\"I think this is just the start of delivering on the day\\" and \\"this has been a long time coming.\\" Wittenberg and NYRR's financial support efforts for U.S. distance running was also noted after Keflezighi's victory. NYRR is also a prominent supporter of National Running Day, which is dedicated to celebrate and promote the sport. =Community= Wittenberg expanded NYRR's presence in the community by providing running classes for various levels of runners, establishing running programs for children through the NYRR Foundation, and setting up an online coaching network. Wittenberg is also involved with programs to prevent childhood obesity, and was a guest of Michelle Obama's at the White House for the President's Task Force on Childhood Obesity. The New York Daily News wrote in an article, \\"Wittenberg is emphatic in her conviction that her job isn't just to put on top pro races, but to cultivate healthy living and be a force for good in the community.\\" The many programs, events and races that the NYRR administers draws more than 300,000 yearly participants. =In the media= NYRR has received some attention for the high entry and application fees for the New York City Marathon. In 2009, the entry fee was raised, for both NYRR members and non-members, making it most expensive premium marathon in the United States. Also, there have been complaints about a non-refundable fee for those who merely apply to gain entry to the race. Wittenberg said that the application fee is necessary due to the weak economy and to ensure commitment from those applying. After both the Men's and Women's 2012 Olympic Trials were awarded to Houston, Wittenberg expressed surprise and frustration with the USATF's process of picking a host city. =Reception= Wittenberg has received notable praise for her work at NYRR. Deena Kastor, an American record holder and Olympic Bronze medalist in the Marathon, said of Wittenberg: \\"In a very short amount of time, she has made so many positive changes in this sport\\". Shalane Flanagan, also an American record holder and an Olympic Bronze Medalist in the 10,000 m, commented \\"What Phil Knight is to Nike, Mary is to distance running.\\" Olympic Sportswriter Philip Hersh was so impressed with Wittenberg's work with NYRR, he suggested that she be named CEO of USA Track and Field. Post-NYRR career In May 2015, Wittenberg was named as CEO of the newly-founded Virgin Group subsidiary Virgin Sport, which was established to provide support to community leaders in the US, the UK and South Africa to organise mass participation running, cycling and triathlon events. However in January 2018 she and the rest of her New York-based team left the company after it decided to focus its efforts exclusively on the UK in 2018, after the planned inaugural American Virgin Sport event due to be held in San Francisco in October 2017 was cancelled due to the proximity of the Northern California wildfires which had started early that month. In December 2018, the cycling team announced that Wittenberg had been appointed as their President, focusing on business and marketing and acting as a liaison between the team and its title sponsor. Personal life NYRR holds over fifty races yearly, and though no longer a marathoner, Wittenberg participates in several of these races. In 2006, she competed in 18 races, and in 2007, she ran 20. Despite her busy schedule, she often runs and cross-trains in Central Park, and starts the day of the New York Marathon with a pre-dawn run. Wittenberg lives in the Upper East Side of New York City, and is married with two sons. Her family attends St. Ignatius Loyola.

A stratigraphic column is a representation used in geology and its subfield of stratigraphy to describe the vertical location of rock units in a particular area. A typical stratigraphic column shows a sequence of sedimentary rocks, with the oldest rocks on the bottom and the youngest on top. In areas that are more geologically complex, such as those that contain intrusive rocks, faults, and/or metamorphism, stratigraphic columns can still indicate the relative locations of these units with respect to one another. However, in these cases, the stratigraphic column must either be a structural column, in which the units are stacked with respect to how they are observed in the field to have been moved by the faults, or a time column, in which the units are stacked in the order in which they were formed. Stratigraphy is a branch of geology that concerns the order and relative position of geologic strata and their relationship to the geologic time scale. The relative time sequencing requires the analysis of the order and position of layers of archaeological remains and the structure of a particular set of strata. The columns can include igneous and metamorphic rocks, however, sedimentary rocks are important geologically because of Classical Laws of Geology and how they relate to the accumulation of sediments and the formation of sedimentary environments. Lithology is a study of bedrock that occurs at a specific location. The strata may contain fossils which aid in determining how old they are and geologist's understanding of sequence and timing. Geologists group together similar lithologies, and call these larger sedimentary sequence formations. There are rules on how formations are named, related to where they are located and what rock type(s) are present. All sedimentary formations shall receive distinctive designations. The most desirable names are binomial, the first part being geographic and the other lithologic. If the rock type is the same, then the formation may be called the \\"Lyons Sandstone,\\" or the \\"Benton Shale.\\" When there are several different lithologies within the formation, a more general terminology is used, such as the \\"Morrison Formation,\\" which contains siltstone, sandstone, and limestone. ‚ÄúFor regional studies, geologists will study the stratigraphy of as many separate areas as they can, prepare a stratigraphic column for each, and combine them in an attempt to understand the regional geologic history of the area‚Äù. Laws and principles of geology Principle of Uniformitarianism: defined in the authoritative Glossary of Geology as \\"the fundamental principle or doctrine that geologic processes and natural laws now operating to modify the Earth's crust have acted in the same regular manner and with essentially the same intensity throughout geologic time, and that past geologic events can be explained by phenomena and forces observable today; the classical concept that 'the present is the key to the past'.\\". Law of Original Horizontality: sedimentary rocks are always deposited as horizontal, or nearly horizontal, strata, although these may be disturbed by later earth movements. This law was proposed by Nicolaus Steno in the mid-17th century. Law of Superposition: general law upon which all geologic chronology is based: In any sequence of layered rocks, sedimentary or extrusive volcanic, that has not been overturned, the youngest stratum is at the top and the oldest at the base; i.e., each bed is younger than the bed beneath, but older than the bed above it. The law was stated by Steno in 1669. Cross-cutting relationships: cross-cutting relationships is a principle of geology that states that the geologic feature which cuts another is the younger of the two features. It is a relative dating technique used commonly by geologists. There are two main processes that are relevant to sedimentary strata formation: tectonic forces which build mountains and the surface, and erosional processes that transport the sediments to lower energy environments where they are then deposited. These processes results in large piles of accumulated sediments whenever there is a change in the depositional environment. The sedimentary particles are deposited dependent on the net energy in the transportation vector, typically water when dealing with sediments clasts. ‚ÄúBrief descriptions of the units may be lettered to the right of the column, as in the figure, or the column may be accompanied by an explanation consisting of a small box for each lithologic symbol and for the other symbols alongside the column. Columns are constructed from the stratigraphic base upward and should be plotted first in pencil in order to insure spaces for gaps at faults and unconformities. Sections that are thicker than the height of the plate can be broken into two or more segments, with the stratigraphic base at the lower left and the top at the upper right. Bedding and unit boundaries are drawn horizontally, except in detailed sections or generalized sections of distinctly nontabular deposits, as some gravels and volcanic units‚Äù. The following elements of a stratigraphic column are essential and are generally keyed to the figure: # title, indicating topic, general location, and whether the section is single (measured in one coherent course), composite (pieced from two or more section segments), averaged, or generalized; # name(s) of geologist(s) and date of the survey; # method of measurement; # graphic scale; # map or description of locality; # major chronostratigraphic units, if known; # lesser chronostratigraphic units, if known; # names and boundaries of rock units; # graphic column composed of standard lithologic patterns; # unconformities; # faults, with thickness of tectonic gaps, if known; # covered intervals, as measured, # positions of key beds; and # positions of important samples, with number and perhaps data. Other kinds of information may be included also. This recorded information from above will give geologist a description of what rocks are in a cliff or underground. This description allows a better understanding to the entire geology of that area. Can be used to decide whether there is potential for oil or natural gas that exists in these rocks. ‚ÄúThe differences between rock unit types and fossils observed within the rock determine how these rocks are grouped for diagramming purposes.

Novels In 1964 Irving Wallace published The Man, a popular novel addressing the idea of a black president, named Douglas Dillman in the book. Recently a critic described it as a window into \\"Kennedy-era racial pathologies\\", despite the author's liberal attitude. It included the portrayal of attractive multiracial or \\"mulatto\\" women who could pass for white, as does the hero Dillman's own light-skinned daughter. The Man‚Äîwhich was made into a 1972 movie starring James Earl Jones as Dillman‚Äînoted factors against a black president being elected in America, and Dillman's coming to power through an unlikely series of circumstances of succession.

Portrayals of blacks as president began to appear in comedians' routines. In the early years of his career in the 1960s, comedian Bill Cosby frequently told jokes along racial lines, including one about an imaginary first black president. He stopped when he decided to reach a wider audience.Block, M. (ed) (1986) Current Biography Yearbook, H.W. Wilson Company. p. 102. In 1983 at age 22, Eddie Murphy (who was born the same year as Obama)Manohla Dargis and A. O.

Movies and television Writers and directors have featured a black man as president in several memorable portrayals. There have been film and television proposals based on the idea, as well.Tolliver, L. (2000) Movie Concepts, Sitcom Presentations. Trafford Publishing. The first movie portrayal of a black American president was probably that of Sammy Davis Jr. in the 1933 film Rufus Jones for President. In this short musical comedy, the 7-year-old Davis is told by his mother, portrayed by Ethel Waters, that \\"anyone can become president, and later dreams of his own inauguration\\". Outside the dreams, the film reflects contemporary racist attitudes. The 1941 musical movie Babes on Broadway included Judy Garland in black male drag singing a song \\"Franklin Delano Jones\\", about the first black president of the United States. \\"When Rod Serling adapted Irving Wallace's \\"The Man\\" to the screen in 1972‚Äîit was a joint production of Paramount Pictures and ABC Circle Films, originally intended to air on ABC's made-for-television Movie of the Week series, but the network chose not to air it, prompting Paramount to release the film to theaters insteadhttp://www.hometheaterforum.com/forum/thread/273866/james-earl-jones- the-man-paramount-1972-on-dvd‚Äîthe political climate had changed sufficiently that he could promote Douglass Dilman from survivor to competitor‚Äîa genuine leader who, after standing up to his white rivals, vows to win the presidency through \\"legitimate\\" electoral means.\\" With James Earl Jones starring in 1972, the film version had a heroic black man as president, who ended the film in a position of moral authority.Osnes, B. and Gill, S.

His competence to lead is not questioned due to his race. In fact, his skin color is never mentioned.Black Presidents in the Movies A generation after The Man, the 1998 science fiction film Deep Impact featured black actor Morgan Freeman as president Tom Beck. Critic Louis Bayard noticed that Dennis Haysbert seemed to adopt Freeman's cadences for his own role as president. In the hit show 24, a television precedent was set when Dennis Haysbert portrayed a lead character, David Palmer, and successful president who fought terrorism. Critic Charles Taylor described him as showing \\"the determination of magnetism, brains, resolve, compassion and willingness to make tough calls we dream of in a president.\\"\\"Although some may question Obama's credentials when it comes to fighting terror, fictional president David Palmer, played by African-American actor Dennis Haysbert on the national security-themed thriller show 24, confronted terror during his administration - until he was assassinated.\\" Solomon Israel, \\"Precedent for black president in US film and TV\\", Une 4, 2008 Jerusalem Post After the show portrayed the assassination of Palmer, his brother Wayne, played by D.B.

Chris Rock wrote, directed, and starred as presidential candidate Mays Gilliam in the 2003 comedy Head of State, described as \\"undernourished.\\" The movie's tagline was \\"The only thing white is the house\\". Another critic described Rock as in way over his head, and found it \\"depressing to see Rock pander to the most reactionary elements of the black audience.\\" He also was surprised at some of the settings. \\"Rock doesn't seem to know much about contemporary America; when his character travels to Memphis (a majority-black city with a black mayor) we see only white people.\\" In 2004, a sketch on Chappelle's Show called \\"Black Bush\\" featured Dave Chappelle as an African-American \\"interpretation\\" of then President George W. Bush and his administration. It was controversial due to its set-up segment (which had Chappelle mocking fellow comedian Dennis Miller over the comedian's infamous \\"free pass\\" comment regarding not saying anything bad about George W. Bush) and its overall theme that if Bush and his top aides were black, that the public would be more willing to be critical of the President and his decisions. The sketch also features cameo appearances by actor Jamie Foxx, who appears as \\"Black Tony Blair\\" and Mos Def as \\"Black Head of the CIA\\" holding \\"Yellowcake from Africa\\" (Anthony Berry's character warns the other not to \\"drop that shit\\", though it is clearly just yellow cake). In CBS's 2004 TV series Century City's fictional timeline, Oprah Winfrey is the US president. Louis Gossett Jr. played the President in two different movies in 2005 -- in the Christian movie Left Behind: World at War he played President Gerald Fitzhugh and in the direct-to- DVD Solar Attack he played President Ryan Gordon. Mike Judge's 2006 Idiocracy featured President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho as a former porn star and champion wrestler played by erstwhile NFL defensive end Terry Alan Crews. Critic Bayard thought it odd that the lead character seemed so little advanced from earlier 20th century caricatures. The \\"joke is essentially unchanged from the days of Rufus Jones: These are the last guys in the world -- or any world -- you'd want to vote for.\\" A 2006 BBC Four adaptation of John Wyndham's short story Random Quest depicts the main character being sucked into an alternate reality in which Condoleezza Rice is president of the United States. In ABC's 2008 series Life on Mars (a remake of BBC's series of the same name), it is hinted that Malia Obama, the daughter of then-candidate Barack Obama, is the President in 2035. =Post-Obama's election= Actor Danny Glover played President Thomas Wilson in the 2009 movie 2012. NBC's 2010 series \\"The Event\\" features Blair Underwood in a starring role as Elias Martinez, an Afro-Cuban US president. Actor Jamie Foxx played President James William Sawyer in the 2013 movie White House Down. Actor Samuel L. Jackson played William Alan Moore, the US president in the 2014 movie Big Game. In the 2014-2015 NBC TV series State of Affairs, Alfre Woodard plays Constance Payton, the first black female president of the United States. In 2015, Keith David voiced the President of the United States in the 2015 second season Rick and Morty episode \\"Get Schwifty.\\" In 2019, the flashforward to 2045 in the final episode of Veep revealed that President Kemi Talbot (Toks Olagundoye) served two terms sometime between 2025 and 2041. President Richard Splett (Sam Richardson) was the incumbent president of 2045, having won a landslide reelection in 2044. In 2019, Morgan Freeman played President Allan Trumbull in Angel Has Fallen, the third movie in the Fallen film series. He previously played Allan Trumbull as Speaker of the House in Olympus Has Fallen and as Vice President in London Has Fallen. Freeman previously played President Tom Beck in the 1998 film Deep Impact. Music Parliament's 1975 Washington, D.C.-themed song Chocolate City had Muhammad Ali as President of the United States and James Brown as vice president, among others. In 1983, R&B; artist Blowfly released a track entitled \\"The first black president\\", a conversation between President Blowfly and his assistant over hip hop music. The music video accompanying N.W.A's \\"Express Yourself\\" featured a shot of the White House with the caption, \\"Live from the Black House\\", followed by one of Dr. Dre swiveling a chair in what is apparently meant to represent the Oval Office. Several more shots in the video continue the same scene. Rap artist Nas was inspired by the Obama campaign to write a song entitled \\"Black President\\", which includes quotations from Obama. The track samples Tupac Shakur with a modified lyric saying, \\"And although it seems heaven sent, we ain't ready to have a black president.\\"(June 4, 2008) \\"Diddy, Young Jeezy, Respond To Barack Obama's Historic Nomination; Check Out Nas' New Song: 'Black President'.\\" MTV News.

Rap artist Young Jeezy, also inspired by the Obama campaign, wrote a song entitled \\"My President\\", which also featured Nas, and featured the chorus \\"My President Is Black ...\\" When he appeared in speaking roles on Snoop Dogg's album No Limit Top Dogg, actor Rudy Ray Moore joked that he would run for president with two priorities - painting the White House black and legalizing just about everything. Other media An unnamed black president played a major role in the 2000 first-person shooter Nintendo 64 video game Perfect Dark. The player must prevent his assassination and lead him to the escape pod on a futuristic rendition of Air Force One. Effect of Obama's presidency on television The Obama presidency has potential to affect television shows, but people have differing reactions to that. The comedian and actor Bill Cosby said he is \\"not all that optimistic that Obama‚Äôs presidency will make a major difference in terms of onscreen diversity,\\" saying \\"they would die before putting another show on about a black family and black pride.\\" \\"Some believe that impact (of having a black president and first family) will take on additional power as the nation - including Hollywood - is exposed to countless images of Obama along with wife Michelle and daughters Malia and Sasha as they hold court in the White House.\\" Chuck Barney, \\"Will the ‚ÄòObama effect' bring change to TV?\\" 26 January 2009, Contra Costa Times Pastor T.D. Jakes noted the portrayal on television of \\"middle-class African-Americans who are articulate, intelligent and thoughtful.\\" He hoped the new president would make a difference in encouraging those types of depictions. \\"The Obama effect might even go beyond bolstering the presence of blacks on television and actually bring about a tonal change in programming,\\" according to Brok Akil.

The station was originally constructed by the Northern and Pacific Junction Railway, a subsidiary of the Northern and Northwestern Railway, in 1884. It was subsequently owned and operated by the Grand Trunk Railway (1888 - 1919) and Canadian National Railways (1919 - 1986). It was a significant station stop along the historic route connecting Toronto to North Bay, and the Canadian Pacific Railway (1885). Transcontinental trains traveling between Toronto and Vancouver once frequented the station. It is likely the oldest wooden railway station in north-eastern Ontario. It is now a community heritage building in the town of South River. History The Northern Railway of Canada had reached Gravenhurst by 1875, which was its northernmost terminal at the time. (The section between Barrie and Gravenhurst was initially built by the Toronto, Simcoe and Muskoka Junction Railway, circa 1870, before being acquired by the Northern Railway in 1875.) The Northern and Northwestern railway network consisted of the former Northern Railway of Canada, and Hamilton and Northwestern Railway, which merged in 1879. Due to the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway through the Mattawa valley, and along the north shore of Lake Nipissing beginning in the summer of 1881, the Toronto-based Northern and Northwestern wished to provide a direct connection to the new C.P.R. transcontinental line that would ensure Toronto's economic involvement. A new company was formed, the \\"Northern and Pacific Junction Railway\\" which was then leased to and operated by the parent Northern and Northwestern Railway, circa 1883. The new line was to extend the existing railhead at Gravenhurst to the C.P.R. mainline at the La Vase River, just east of Lake Nipissing. This location was subsequently named Nipissing Junction. The line was referred to as \\"The Callander Extension\\" at the time, as the village of Callander was the closest existing establishment to the junction point. Construction began in 1884 and was finished in 1886. Regular-schedule, revenue service commenced in the spring of 1887. One year later in 1888, the Grand Trunk Railway bought out the Northern and Northwestern Railway, including the Northern and Pacific Junction Railway. From that time on, until the insolvency of the G.T.R. circa 1918-1919 the line was owned and operated by the Grand Trunk Railway. From that time until the present day, the line has been owned and operated by Canadian National Railways. The South River Station is one of the first generation, original wooden stations built by the Northern and Pacific Junction Railway. It is also the last surviving station originally built along the line, all of the others having been demolished or replaced. This ranks it among the oldest railway stations in northern Ontario, and likely the oldest wooden station still existing in the region. The South River station was built on the east side of the mainline and situated between Ottawa Avenue and Montreal Avenue. It featured a hip roof over the operators bay, and two gable dormers over the freight/express section. It was later moved by the Grand Trunk to the west side of the mainline, opposite to its original location, likely around 1907-1908 (Requires confirmation.) At this time, a new operators bay was constructed and finished with a new gable roof to face the mainline. The freight/express section was also altered with the addition of one shed-roof dormer, which was also added to face the mainline. The station featured a combination of painted wood siding finishes: tongue and groove infill along the base course, doors, and soffit; and board and batten in the mid and upper courses. The original roof was cedar shingle. Heating was provided by pot-belly stoves using wood and/or coal. Initial interior and exterior platform lighting was provided by kerosene lanterns. While the original Northern and Pacific Junction Railway paint scheme is unknown, the standard Grand Trunk Railway paint scheme of hunter green, burgundy and yellow cream was used thereafter. Sometime in the post-war era (after 1945) a gray asphalt siding product (Insulbrick) was applied by Canadian National Railways over the wall sections. Asphalt roll and shingles later replaced the initial use of cedar shingles. Consistent with the treatment of their historic railway stations, Canadian National Railways made numerous unsympathetic alterations to the building over the years, diminishing its original architectural elements and finishes. General neglect and lack of investment in these types of stations rendered most of them beyond repair, in which case they were demolished or left to decay. The community of South River, however, established a restoration group which has overseen a concerted effort to save and re-establish the original paint scheme and wood finishes of the structure. Restoration work on the station was undertaken in the early to mid 2000s, with the hope to rehabilitate the building and re-use it for a new community purpose. Uses involving a heritage center and the local library were suggested. Passenger service In 1887, revenue passenger and freight services commenced under the Northern and Pacific Junction Railway Division of the Northern and Northwestern Railway, based in Toronto. Passenger coaches were noted as being of the same standard as the C.P.R. to ensure interoperability with the C.P.R. at North Bay. These operations were short- lived under the Northern and Pacific Junction name however, as one year later the Grand Trunk Railway acquired all operations of the Northern and Northwestern Railway. From 1888 until roughly 1919, passenger and freight traffic between North Bay and Toronto was provided primarily by the Grand Trunk Railway. The Canadian Pacific Railway is recorded as having operated passenger and freight services along the line, under running-rights agreements with the Grand Trunk Railway, until the C.P.R. built their own line from Toronto to Sudbury in 1906‚Äì1908. During the First World War era, The National Transcontinental Railway & Grand Trunk Pacific Railway also used the route to connect Toronto directly to their transcontinental mainline at Cochrane, Ontario, via the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway. Special joint services between the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway, and the Grand Trunk Railway provided passenger services to points north of North Bay. Trains such as the 'Cobalt Express' provided service between Toronto and the world- famous silver mining community of Cobalt, Ontario circa 1906 onwards. The Grand Trunk also produced travel brochures promoting the Lake Nipissing and Lake Temagami areas to sportsmen and tourists. The Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway was renamed the \\"Ontario Northland Railway\\" in 1946. It featured a regular passenger train service between Cochrane and Toronto called \\"The Northland.\\" The Northland became a night-train service when \\"The Northlander\\" day-time passenger service was introduced in the late 1970s. It was a station stop for Northlander trains of Ontario Northland before service was discontinued in 2012 by the Ontario Liberal Government under Dalton McGuinty and later Kathleen Wynne, in a politically targeted and punitive reduction of services to the Conservative and NDP dominant ridings of north- eastern Ontario.

In this letter, Eusebius explains his ingenious system of Gospel harmony, the Eusebian Canons (tables) that divide the four Canonical gospels, and describes their purpose, ten in number. Eusebius explains that Ammonius the Alexandrian had made a system in which he placed sections of the gospels of Mark, Luke and John next to their parallel sections in Matthew. As this disrupted the normal text order of the gospels of Mark, Luke and John, Eusebius used a system in which he placed the references to the parallel texts in ten tables or 'canons'. By using these tables, the parallel texts could easily be looked up, but it also remained possible to read a gospel in its normal order. (The number of sections was: Matthew 355, Mark 236, Luke 342, John 232 ‚Äì together 1165 sections). The number of each \\"Ammonian section\\" is written in the margin of a manuscript, and underneath these numbers, another number was written in coloured ink. The coloured numbers referred to one of the ten Eusebian canons, in which the reference numbers were to be found of the parallel sections in the other gospels.F. H. A.

She began her writing career novelizing plays,\\"The Compleat Grace Miller White\\", Mysteryfile.com Blog before turning her hand to novels in 1909. Several of her books were adapted for the big screen, most notably Tess of the Storm Country, which was filmed on four occasions between 1914 and 1960. She adopted the name Grace around 1897, in memory of a younger sister who had died before reaching her first birthday. Biography Mary Esther Miller was born in 1868, in Ithaca, New York. As a child, White was lame and walked with crutches, so she could not be sent to school. Although she was later cured, she was married at the age of 15 and never had any regular schooling. By the age of 23, she had given birth to five children. At 23, she became a widow in Butte, Montana, with four children. Although one of her children was blind and died later, she brought up her three other children and eventually sent her oldest child through college. She married twice, first to Homer White, and then to Friend H. Miller. At some point in her life, White began traveling for a drug firm. She took her sample case through the Midwest, Virginias, and Carolinas, receiving a month and her expenses. Although she made enough money, White gave up her job as she wanted to find something else that would allow her to be at home with her children. With this idea, White came to New York City in 1899 and received employment in secretarial work with the Paris exposition commission. However, in less than a year, the Paris exposition ended, and White was left without a job. At this time, White had also been studying by attending a private evening school. After two years of night study, she took the regents‚Äô exam which qualified her to enter college. However, she declined to pursue further education. One day, White went to lunch with a stenographer she knew who was working at a paper called the American Commerce and Industry. The paper was run by George Casey and was published in the interests of the McKinley political campaign. The stenographer was able to introduce her to Mr. Casey, and eventually, after writing a sample letter, White was hired by the publication to write matter that would appeal to the women of the United States promoting the election of McKinley. After some time, White was also hired to make public political speeches supporting McKinley. For several years afterwards, White regularly participated in the republican campaign committee of New York to speak in every campaign both within the city and the surrounding country. Although White first began her writing career novelizing plays, she eventually began working on novels and wrote her first big seller, Tess of the Storm Country in 1909. This book received many favorable reviews and was made into four different film adaptations.

Description The GK-55 is a stripped-down model based on the 1955 Gibson Les Paul, before the company began to produce the Les Paul Special. It is a flat-top 55 body style, dark sunburst or black, two \\"T top\\" humbuckers, no binding, dot inlays, and a bolt on neck. The GK-55 also came equipped with the TP-6 fine-tuning tailpiece. These were made in the Gibson plant in Kalamazoo, MI from 1979 through early 1981. the GK stands for Gibson- Kalamazoo. The Gibson model GK-55 was produced for only three consecutive years in short runs. Although the exact quantity produced is a matter of debate, the consensus is that only around 1000 were made. The changing face of Gibson It is rumored by some Gibson employees that the GK-55 may have possibly been an attempt by Gibson to re-purpose Baldwin overstock parts remaining in the Kalamazoo plant. Other guitars constructed at that plant were products such as Kalamazoo (with its waning popularity), Epiphone & Baldwin. The exception being that the Baldwin series head stock was identical in design to the only other \\"Bolt-on\\" made at the time. It is more likely that Gibson was looking to put a less expensive alternative to the popular Les Paul line. With the diminishing quality of US made guitars in the late '70s. Both Gibson & Fender were reaching for higher margin products to bolster profits. The only concrete source to confirm this assertion would have been Gibson's Kalamazoo plant manager Jim Duerloo. Since Gibson's financial issues from 1974‚Äì1986 brought all production of Gibson, Epiphone & Kalamazoo electric guitars at the Kalamazoo plant to a halt. Shipping Epiphone overseas and moving Gibson to Memphis. Especially with the decrease in competition by Gibson copies, it was an obvious market opening for Gibson to take advantage of. Although, subject to conjecture, it is a brilliant marketing move for the new owners of almost defunct Gibson Guitars. CMI president Maurice Berlin, after taking over in 1974 did make some enduring decisions for the future of Gibson. So while the GK-55 may not be a \\"feature rich\\" Gibson, it is one of the most iconic of the transition of Gibson Guitars, from failure to the manufacturer of some of the finest mass production guitars in the world today. One of the main features of the GK-55 was the use of the \\"Bolt-On\\" neck which differentiated it from Les Paul's concept leaving it without the famous \\"Les Paul\\" monogram. Other distinguishing features were the use of the \\"Creme-Black\\" PAF pickups, seen more commonly now on Gibson products today, the very distinctive TP-6 \\"Fine- Tuning\\" system in place of the stock Gibson tail piece, commonly used, at the time and the lack of a pick guard. The peculiarity of the TP-6 was seen almost exclusively on tremolo systems (such as Kahler), and was not a popular addition to \\"hard-tail\\" guitars of the era adding to the unique qualities of the GK-55. The GK-55 only came in one color, the two-tone dark sunburst, giving its flat top the appearance of depth, again unlike most of Gibson's mainstream. As with most of the Gibson line, at the time it came standard with either a black or a maroon red \\"Gibson\\" tagged hard shell case and sold for under $400 at the time.

He is known for numerous sculptural embellishments that adorn buildings in the Cape region of South Africa, thought to represent the crowning achievement of the Cape Baroque style. Background and early life Although his father's occupation is unknown, an elder brother, Georg, was a builder and architect who settled in Hungary. During the baroque era, architecture and sculpture were closely allied and it is likely that Anreith received his training from an artist's studio, such as that of Christian Wenzinger, a sculptor and architect. He is also thought to have studied under Joseph Amann and later Joseph H√∂rr. During the time of his apprenticeship in the 1770s, rococo architects Johann Michael Fischer and Johann Balthasar Neumann were well known, as were stucco decorators like the Feuchtmayer family of the Wessobrunner School. Anreith arrived at the Cape of Good Hope as a soldier in the service of the Dutch East-India Company in 1777 on the vessel Woestduijn. Career and works=Church pulpits= The Groote Kerk pulpit Although he was a trained sculptor, he was initially employed as a carpenter. His status changed when, in the 1780s, a wealthy Lutheran named Martin Melck commissioned him to carve a pulpit for the Lutheran Church in Strand Street, Cape Town. His earliest work for the Lutheran Church in Strand Street was the King David relief on the organ loft, done in 1783, but the most important work was the pulpit completed in 1785 to 1786. The memorial plaque, dedicated to Martin Melck is also of his making, as are the windows and the doors. By 1791 Anreith had completed work on the interior of the building and proceeded to give the church a new facade (1791‚Äì1792). Unfortunately, this was rebuilt in 1820, along with Anreith's turret, now known only from drawings by Lady Anne Barnard and John Barrow. He also had considerable influence over the facade and carved teak portal of the neighbouring parsonage, known as the Martin Melck House. In 1786, he was appointed master-sculptor to the Dutch East India Company. Not to be outdone by the Lutherans, in 1788 the Dutch Reformed Church commissioned Anreith to create a pulpit. He was assisted by Jan Jacob Graaff (1754‚Äì1804), chief carpenter at the Company, who arrived in Cape Town in 1775. Though the pulpit was designed by Anreith, the higher ranking Graaff received 1100 rix dollars, as opposed to his 900. Graaff completed the pulpit in 18 months and it was inaugurated at the Groote Kerk in Adderley Street on 29 November 1789. =Groot Constantia= Close up of the pediment gable \\"The Rape of Ganymede\\" by sculptor Anton Anreith. Anreith left the service of the Company and worked independently from 1791, often closely with the architect Louis Michel Thibault. That year he did his first project with the architect, the wine- cellar at Groot Constantia, commissioned by Hendrik Cloete, for which he designed an elaborate baroque pediment, The Rape of Ganymede, a depiction of the myth of the youth, abducted by Zeus in the form of an eagle, who became cup-bearer to the Greek Gods. He arranged a multitude of putti figures in front of a row of wine vats, joined to one another with vines and bunches of grapes. The childlike Ganymede is central, seated on an eagle, pouring wine from a jar. At the Groot Constantia homestead, a niched gable statue of Abundantia stands holding a cornucopia. This work was likely done around 1800, although Dora Fairbridge claims Cloete family tradition holds it not to be by Anreith. A bath with Triton, also at Constantia, is more likely to be by his hand. In 1789 Thibault and Anreith were joined by Hermann Schutte, an architect and builder from Bremen and the three of them had a profound influence on the development of Cape Town architecture in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.Cape Info The triumvirate of Thibault, Anreith and Schutte would for many years work out of a workshop in the Castle. =The Kat Balcony= Kat Balcony, Castle of Good Hope During the years 1785 to 1791, Governor of the Dutch East India Company Colony Cornelis Jacob van de Graaff made a number of improvements to the Castle of Good Hope. These included a portal to the Governor's residence, called the Kat Balcony.\\"Kat\\" is a Dutch term for a transverse wall. It dates from Roman times when it also meant a seat of authority or place of command on a battlefield. (References: Cape Town Highlanders , Dirk Teeuwen (2007) Kasteel De Goede Hoop ) Anreith produced a painted teak portico and entrance portal. The stucco parapet, Ionic columns, folding door and fanlight, along with teak lion doorknockers, are signature Anreith. =Other works= Anreith undoubtedly executed the carvings and fanlights at Rust en Vreugd. At the Herzog House, 131 Bree Street, a pedimental relief of Mercury as a boy (circa 1790), was removed when the house was demolished in 1970. His work is evident at the Koopmans-de Wet House, and the Huguenot Memorial Museum in Franschhoek, where some woodwork of the demolished Saasveld House survives. The Lioness Gateway in the Company's Gardens survives, although the accompanying Lion Gateway is now a replica. The Lioness Gateway used to serve as entrance to the Company's menagerie, an area now occupied by the Michaelis School of Fine Art. In addition to his sculpture and plaster-work, Anreith made a living teaching life drawing and geometry. He was also head of the first art school in South Africa which was founded by the Freemasons. He became a Freemason in 1797 as a member of the Lodge de Goede Hoop, for which he designed a number of lime plaster statues, of which three survived a fire in 1892: a Silence figure with an owl; a recumbent man with a dagger, book and hourglass; and a weeping woman and child. During the Batavian Republic (1803‚Äì1806), Anreith and Thibault created a drinking fountain for the Parade, no longer extant but echoed in the design of the Hurling Pump in Oranjezicht. Anreith was responsible for the lion's mask carving on the pump. Anton Anreith's later years were marked by poverty, loneliness and a decline in the quality of his work due to frailty. He died in 1822, at his residence at 8 Bloem Street, Cape Town.

Biography In 1308, Margaret married Boles≈Çaw III the Generous. The betrothal had been her father's doing. Since Boles≈Çaw's arrival at the Bohemian court and after his betrothal to Margaret, the King clearly favored him; this attitude caused fear between the closest male relatives of the King, who saw the young Duke of Legnica as a potential rival for the throne. Although Wenceslaus II had a son who seemed to render him irrelevant, the sudden death of the King in 1305 and one year later the murder of his son and successor Wenceslaus III in Olomouc gained him an unexpected importance. Boles≈Çaw began his fight for the Bohemian throne taking the title of \\"haeres Regni Poloniae\\" (heir of the Polish Kingdom). The throne of Bohemia passed to Henry of Carinthia, who was married to Margaret's eldest sister, Anna of Bohemia. Henry and Anna were only on the throne for a year before Rudolf of Habsburg overthrew them. He married Elisabeth Richeza of Poland; who was Margaret's stepmother. By 1307, Rudolf had died so Henry and Anna were invited back but were still not secure. They turned their attentions to Margaret and Anna's sister Elisabeth. Elisabeth was young and unmarried, Anna and Henry wanted her to marry Otto of L√∂bdaburg for political reasons but Elisabeth refused. Instead, Elisabeth married John of Luxembourg who overthrew Henry and Anna once and for all. They went to live in Carinthia were Anna died in 1313, childless. John and Elisabeth became King and Queen of Bohemia. They had many children - among them were Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor and Bonne of Bohemia; by now any chances of Boles≈Çaw and Margaret becoming King and Queen of Bohemia were gone. Margaret died one day after giving birth to her youngest child. Boles≈Çaw remarried in 1326, taking Katarina ≈†ubiƒá (d. bef. 5 March 1358) as his second wife. Issue Margaret and Boleslaw had three children: #Wenceslaus I (b. ca. 1318 ‚Äì d. 2 June 1364). #Louis I the Fair (b. ca. 1321 ‚Äì d. 6/23 December 1398). #Nikolaus (b. and d. Hradec Kr√°lov√©, 7 April 1322).
