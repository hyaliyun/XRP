Rignall wrote the book 29 Below about the experience in 1979. Attack by John Wayne Gacy Rignall identified as bisexual and lived with his girlfriend and a male, described by Rignall's attorney as a live-in companion. While walking to a local gay bar in Rosemont, Illinois, on March 21, 1978, Gacy lured the 26-year-old Rignall into his car, promising to give him a ride and smoke a joint with him. Gacy then held a rag soaked in chloroform over Rignall's mouth until he passed out. Rignall woke up intermittently during the car ride to Gacy's house but was chloroformed again each time he stirred and eventually lapsed into unconsciousness. When Rignall awoke, he was inside of Gacy's house. Rignall was fastened to a torture device called \\"the rack\\". The device kept Rignall restrained on a wooden board suspended by chains with holes for his arms and head to go through. Gacy stood naked in front of him with an array of dildos and described in detail what he would do to Rignall with each of them. Gacy then brutally raped, drugged, whipped, and tortured Rignall. In later accounts, Rignall stated that there was another man in the room while Gacy raped him. Rignall regained consciousness under a statue in Chicago's Lincoln Park. He made it back to his girlfriend's house and she took him to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where he stayed for six days. In the hospital Rignall recounted the experience to police, but they were skeptical of his story and did not issue an arrest warrant. Rignall testified against Gacy in People v. Gacy and said that Gacy was not legally sane at the time of the attack, citing \\"...the beastly and animalistic ways he attacked me\\". Gacy was sentenced to death in 1980 after a trial, and was executed on May 10, 1994, at Stateville Correctional Center in Crest Hill. 29 Below Rignall partnered with author Ron Wilder to write a memoir of his experience with Gacy and his investigative attempts to find the rapist afterward. The book, 29 Below, was released in 1979. 29 Below describes staking out freeways and overpasses to spot Gacy's black Oldsmobile. He eventually spotted Gacy, writing down his license plate and following him to Gacy's house. He provided police with the license plate number and address, but they did not act on the information. By the time police took Rignall's account seriously, Gacy had already been arrested for murder charges. Death Rignall died on December 24, 2000 of AIDS-related causes.

They are compatible with different types of detectors such as infrared and ultraviolet. The primary purpose for ROICs is to accumulate the photocurrent from each pixel and then transfer the resultant signal onto output taps for readout. Conventional ROIC technology stores the signal charge at each pixel and then routes the signal onto output taps for readout. This requires storing large signal charge at each pixel site and maintaining signal-to-noise ratio (or dynamic range) as the signal is read out and digitized. A ROIC has high-speed analog outputs to transmit pixel data outside of the integrated circuit. If digital outputs are implemented, the IC is referred to as a Digital Readout Integrated Circuit (DROIC). Digital readout integrated circuit (DROIC) block diagram A Digital readout integrated circuit (DROIC) is a class of ROIC that uses on-chip analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) to digitize the accumulated photocurrent in each pixel of the imaging array. DROICs are easier to integrate into a system compared to ROICs as the package size and complexity are reduced, they are less sensitive to noise and have higher bandwidth compared to analog outputs. A Digital pixel readout integrated circuit (DPROIC) is a ROIC that uses on-chip analog-to- digital conversion (ADC) within each pixel (or small group of pixels) to digitize the accumulated photocurrent within the imaging array. DPROICs have an even higher bandwidth than DROICs and can significantly increase the well capacity and dynamic range of the device.

Thomas Mortimer, 1799 engraving Life He was the son of Thomas Mortimer (1706‚Äì1741), principal secretary to Sir Joseph Jekyll, the Master of the Rolls, and grandson of John Mortimer, and was born on 9 December 1730 in Carey Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields in London. His mother died in 1744, and he was left under the guardianship of John Baker of Spitalfields. Mortimer went to Harrow School, under James Cox, and then to a private academy in the north, but was largely self-taught. In 1750 he published An Oration on the much lamented death of H.R.H. Frederick, Prince of Wales, and began to study elocution. He also learnt French and Italian for his study of modern history. In November 1762 Mortimer was made English vice-consul for the Austrian Netherlands, on the recommendation of John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, secretary of state, and went to Ostend. He hoped for the consulship; but Robert Wood was more successful at intrigue, as under-secretary to Lord Weymouth, and Mortimer was dismissed from his post in 1768, as a Wilkite; John Wilkes was known to be a personal friend of Mortimer.Harry William Pedicord, Mr. and Mrs. Garrick: Some Unpublished Correspondence, PMLA Vol. 60, No. 3 (Sep. 1945), pp. 775‚Äì783, at p. 779 note 20.

A., Schiff, T., Yu, T., Org. Lett., 2002, 4, 1189-1192. Although the groups of E. Tagliavini and K. Mikami reported the catalysis of this reaction using a Ti(IV)‚ÄìBINOL complex in the same year as the Keck group,Aoki, S., Mikami, K., Terada, M., Nakai, T., Tetrahedron 1993, 49, 1783-1792.Costa, A. L., Piazza, M. G., Tagliavini, E., Trombini, C., Umani-Ronchi, A., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1993, 115, 7001-7002. Keck's publication reported higher enantio- and diastereoselectivity, and did not require the use of 4 Angstrom molecular sieves as in Mikami's procedure or an excess of BINOL as in Tagliavini's procedure.Keck, G. E., Geraci, L. S., Tetrahedron Lett. 1993, 34, 7827-7828. Keck's early success with stereoselectivity and the simplicity of the catalyst preparation led to many improvements in reaction design, including development of other structural analogs of BINOL, use of stoichiometric additives to enhance the reaction rate, and broadening the scope of the reaction to include substituted stannane nucleophiles. Mechanism The mechanism of this allylation is not fully known, although a cycle involving activation of the aldehyde by the bidentate BINOL-Ti complex followed by the addition of the allyl ligand to the aldehyde, removal of the tributyltin, and transmetallation to regenerate the Ti complex has been proposed.Keck, G. E., Krishnamurthy, D., Grier, M. C., J. Org. Chem., 1993, 58, 6543-6544.Faller, J. W., Sams, D. W. I., Liu, X., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1996, 118, 1217-1218.Denmark, S. E., Hosoi, S., J. Org. Chem., 1994, 59, 5133-5135. Mechanism for the Keck allylation Work performed by Keck and followed up by Faller and coworkers showed a positive nonlinear effect (NLE) correlating the product enantiomeric purity with the BINOL enantiomeric purity. These observations imply that a dimeric meso-chiral catalyst is less active than the homochiral dimers, leading to the observed chiral amplification.Keck, G. E., Krishnamurthy, D., Grier, M. C., J. Org. Chem., 1993, 58, 6543-6544.Faller, J. W., Sams, D. W. I., Liu, X., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1996, 118, 1217-1218. Corey's Stereochemical model of catalyst binding Corey and coworkers established a CH-O hydrogen bonding model that accounts for the absolute stereochemistry of the transformation.Corey, E. J., Lee, T. W., Chem. Comm., 2001, 1321-1329. Improvements The Tagliavini group, which had carried out asymmetric allylation using a similar BINOL-Ti(IV) complex, followed up early successes by synthesizing a variety of enantiopure substituted binaphthyl ligands. The most successful of these substituted binaphthyls, shown below, gave 92% product enantiomeric excess in the addition of allyltributyltin to aldehydes with a Ti(OiPr)2Cl2 metal complex.Bandin, M., Casolari, S., Cozzi, P. G., Proni, G., Schmohel, E., Spada, G. P., Tagliavini, E., Umani-Ronchi, A., Eur. J. Org. Chem., 2000, 491-497. Benzyl derived BINOL ligand The Brenna group developed a synthesis for a binol analog, shown below, which can be resolved into its enantiomers quite easily and used as a chiral auxiliary for stereoselective Keck allylations, showing in some cases improved enantiomeric excesses of up to 4% over the (R)-BINOL catalyzed allylations.Brenna, E., Scaramelli, L., Serra, S., SynLett, 2000, 357-358. Additionally, the developed auxiliary also showed an NLE similar to the classic BINOL, allowing enantio- impure quantities to be used. BINOL derivative Faller's group, whose aforementioned work helped elucidate the chiral amplification of the reaction, also developed the use of diisopropyl tartrate in a chiral poisoning strategy. Diisopropyl tartrate, racemic BINOL, Ti(OiPr)4, phenylaldehyde, and allyltributyltin were used to give enantiomeric excesses of up to 91%.Faller, J. W., Sams, D. W. I., Liu, X., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1996, 118, 1217-1218. Polymer derived from BINOL Yoshida and coworkers developed a synthesis of dendritic binaphthols that serve as homogenous, easily recoverable catalyst systems, and showed that they were amenable to forming homoallylic alcohols using Keck's allylation conditions.Yamago, S., Furukawa, M., Azuma, A., Yoshida, J., Tetrahedron Lett., 1998, 39, 3783-3786. Maruoka and Kii developed a bidentate Ti(IV) binol ligand for the allylation of aldehydes with the aim of restricting M-O bond rotation between the lewis acid and the aldehyde in order to improve enantiomeric excesses. The bidentate ligand contains two titaniums, binols, and an aromatic diamine connecting moiety, gave enantiomeric excesses of up to 99%.Kii, S., Maruoka, K., Tetrahedron Lett., 2001, 42, 1935-1939. Improved stereoselectivity is proposed to come from double activation of the carbonyl from the titaniums, a hypothesis supported by C13 NMR and IR spectroscopy studies on 2,6-Œ≥-pyrone substrate. The most convincing evidence that the M-O rotation is restricted comes from NOE NMR studies on trans-4-methoxy-3-buten-2-one. Radiation of methoxyvinyl protons in free enone and in enone complexed with monodentate Ti(IV) show s-cis and s-trans conformations, while radiation of the enone in a bidentate Ti(IV) complex showed predominantly s-trans conformers. In 2003, this group extended the allylation strategy using this bidentate catalyst to ketones.Kii, S., Maruoka, K., Chirality, 2003, 15, 68-70. Thiol involved reaction scheme Two key steps in the allylation reaction involve breakage of the Sn-C bond in the allyl fragment and formation of the O-Sn bond to facilitate reproduction of the Ti(IV) catalyst. Chan Mo-Yu and coworkers developed an alkylthiosilane accelerator to promote both of these steps, simultaneously increasing the reaction rate and lowering the required catalyst dosages.Yu, C. -M., Choi, H. ‚ÄìS., Jung, W. ‚ÄìH., Lee, S. ‚ÄìS., Tetrahedron Lett., 1996, 37, 7095-7098. Coupling of phenylaldehyde with allyltributyltin afforded 91% yield and 97% enantiomeric excess of homoallylic alcohol using 10 mol% of the BINOL-Ti(IV) catalyst, however addition of the alkylthiosilane and use of only 5 mol% catalyst gave 80% yield and 95% enantiomeric excess of homoallylic alcohol. Reaction scheme of substituted keck allylation Brueckner and Weigand extended the use of this allylation chemistry to beta-substituted stannanes, including those that contain heterocycles, in 1996, exploring a variety of titanium alkoxides, premixing times, and reaction temperatures.Weigand, S., Bruckner, R., Chem. Eur. J., 1996, 2, 1077-1084. The optimal discovered conditions were 10 mol% Ti(OiPr)4 or Ti(OEt)4, 20 mol% enantiopure BINOL, with a premixing period of 2 hours, giving enantiomeric excesses of up to 99%.

They are typically made from a large barrel-shaped metal container that has been filled with high explosives, possibly shrapnel, oil or chemicals as well, and then dropped from a helicopter or airplane. Due to the large amount of explosives (up to ), their poor accuracy and indiscriminate use in populated civilian areas (including refugee camps), the resulting detonations have been devastating. Critics have characterised them as weapons of terror and illegal under international conventions. The earliest known use of barrel bombs in their current form was by the Israeli military in 1948. The second known use of barrel bombs was by the US military in Vietnam in the late 1960s. Starting in the 1990s, they were also used in Sri Lanka, Croatia and Sudan. Barrel bombs have been used extensively by the Syrian Air Force during the Syrian Civil War‚Äîbringing the weapon to widespread global attention‚Äîand later by the Iraqi forces during the Anbar clashes. Experts believe they will continue to be embraced by unstable nations fighting insurgencies since they are cheap to make and utilise the advantages of a government's airpower. Description Barrel bombs are cheap to produce, potentially costing as little as $200 to $300. They can be used with any type of aircraft including non-military cargo planes. The explosive payload can be as simple as fertilizer and diesel. The bomb may contain metal shrapnel such as nuts and bolts or even chemicals such as chlorine. The bomb is barrel-shaped and might be made from improvised material or specially designed. The early versions in Syria used lit fuses and thus had to be carefully timed, otherwise they would fail to explode before breaking apart on the ground or explode too soon in the air. Later models had impact fuses and stabilizing fins which were improved on over time. Earlier barrel bombs also weighed less (100‚Äì300 pounds/45‚Äì150 kg), while later versions range from 1,000 pounds (454 kg) to 1 ton(ne). Barrel bombs by country Israel Barrel bombs were used by the Israeli Air Force during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. On July 15‚Äì16, the Israeli Air Force dropped barrel bombs on the town of Saffuriyya during Operation Dekel. Historian Nafez Nazzal quotes one of the villagers, the quartermaster of the Saffuriyya militia, describing the attack: United States A diagram from an Army training manual showing how to load barrel bombs onto a CH-47 Chinook helicopter In April 1968, during Operation Inferno of the Vietnam War, the United States dropped dozens of barrels filled with incendiary fuel and tear gas-equivalent, in order to start forest fires and to flush out Viet Cong guerrillas in the U Minh forest. The bombs were not aimed at heavily populated areas and in the end were not very effective at starting forest fires. Sri Lanka During the Sri Lankan Civil War (1983‚Äì2009), barrel bombs were used by government forces. William Dalrymple reported that the Sri Lanka Air Force, lacking modern bombers, used Chinese Y-12 transport planes to drop improvised bombs packed into wooden barrels onto civilian areas in the northern peninsula of Jaffna. A 1990 newspaper reported that \\"barrel bombs - 210 litre cast iron barrels packed with explosives, rubber and saw dust\\" were used against residential areas knocking out 20 houses at a time in the Jaffna region.The London Daily Telegraph, 13 September 1990. Excerpt available online. Croatia In 1991, barrel bombs were used by Croatian forces against Serbian forces during the Battle of Vukovar, where they were dropped from Antonov An-2 agricultural airplanes. The device was called the Bojler Bomba (\\"boiler bomb\\") as it was made by filling ordinary household hot water boilers with explosives and shrapnel. The effects were predominantly psychological. As background, a Croatian airforce was established in 1990, made up of volunteers from a sports club at Sinj. They were private individuals and enthusiasts. Their weapons were home-made and improvised. Bojler Bomba are now on display at a number of museums in Croatia including the Technical Museum Zagreb and the Military Museum of the Croatian Ministry of Defence. Human Rights Watch (HRW) also reported a first-hand account of a boiler bomb being used in ground combat in Zlati≈°te. A boiler bomb was rolled down a hill into enemy trenches while snipers tried to blow it up before it reached their position - it eventually got stuck in a tree and \\"all it did was destroy a lot of trees\\". See page 20, last paragraph. Sudan Barrel bombs have been used in Sudan since at least the 1990s. They were studded with nails and rolled out of the cargo doors of Russian-made Antonov An-24 and Antonov An-26 transport aircraft onto insurgent populations in South Sudan and Darfur. Barrel bombs were used, beginning in early 2003, after the Sudan Liberation Army rebelled against Khartoum. They were used again, beginning in 2011, when a new insurgency began after the south separated from the north. Syria Before the civil war, the Syrian arsenal was built to combat the Israeli army which enjoyed air superiority, and thus did not have much in the way of close air support (e.g., air to ground bombs and missiles), but instead predominantly had ground-to-air and air-to-air missiles to harass and delay the Israeli air force. The Syrian military thus soon ran out of precision weapons, had trouble obtaining more and needed a cheap and readily available supply of air to ground weapons. The use of barrel bombs in the Syrian Civil War was first identified in August 2012, in particular through the video forensic work of Eliot Higgins (Brown Moses) and Richard Lloyd. Their existence was initially denied by a Russian military expert until a video surfaced in October 2012 from inside a moving helicopter showing a barrel bomb being lit and dropped onto a target by Syrian Air Force personnel. The person who allegedly came up with the scheme to load barrels with explosives, nails, and metal fragments is Suheil al-Hassan, or \\"The Tiger\\", an Alawite Colonel. The deliberate use of indiscriminate weapons makes Syrian President Bashar al-Assad potentially liable for war crimes. As such, Assad has denied the use of these weapons, saying \\"We have bombs, missiles and bullets. There [are] no barrel bombs, we don't have barrels.\\" Nevertheless, there is considerable video, pictorial, and after the fact proof of the use of such weapons in Syria. Video evidence of a barrel bomb being used was recovered from a mobile phone found in the wreckage of a crashed government forces helicopter in May 2015. British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said, \\"This video footage exposes Assad's lies on barrel bombs\\", and \\"We will bring those involved in these criminal acts to justice\\". Barrel bomb attacks throughout Syria have killed more than 20,000 people since the conflict began in March 2011, according to a December 2013 statement by the opposition Syrian National Council (SNC). It is estimated that, as of mid- March 2014, between 5,000 and 6,000 barrel bombs have been dropped during the war and their use has escalated. Aleppo has been the focal point of the Syrian government's use of barrel bombs.Channel 4 News 14 March 2014 Aleppo BBC April 2104 reporthrw barrel bombs hit Aleppo Over time, government forces have refined their use of the barrel bomb to cause maximum damage - dropping one device and then waiting 10 to 30 minutes to drop another bomb on the same location. This \\"signature tactic\\" of the Syrian air force has been referred to as a \\"double-tap\\" barrel bombing. According to opposition activists, the aim is to ensure that those who flood the scene to rescue the victims are then themselves killed. In February 2014, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 2139 that demanded an end to indiscriminate aerial bombardment including the use of barrel bombs. China and Russia supported the measure allowing its passage. Five months later in August 2014, it was reported that barrel bomb use had instead escalated in defiance of the ban. Human Rights Watch produced a map showing at least 650 new impact locations consistent with barrel bomb attacks. In early September 2014, Samantha Power, U.S. Permanent Representative to the U.N., stated that \\"The Syrian government has increased its reliance on barrel bombs to wage a brutal aerial campaign\\". By November 2014, it has been reported that the Syrian government has increased its barrel bombing campaign while world attention has been diverted following the American-led intervention in Syria. Khaled Khoja, leader of the main Western-backed Syrian National Coalition, described barrel bombs as playing a major role fueling Syrian refugees fleeing into neighboring countries and Europe. According to Raed al-Saleh, head of the Syrian Civil Defense, \\"The localized effect of a barrel bomb is the same as an earthquake measuring 8 on the Richter scale\\". Iraq In May 2014, it was reported by witnesses that the Iraqi army dropped barrel bombs on the city of Fallujah and surrounding areas, killing civilians during the Anbar clashes (2013‚Äì14). According to Mohammed al-Jumaili, a local journalist, the army repeatedly dropped barrel bombs \\"targeting mosques, houses and markets.\\" Their use was later confirmed by a mid-level Iraqi security officer in Anbar province who admitted that barrel bombs had in fact been dropped in Fallujah. It has been reported by Iraqis that the attacks usually come at night, in order not to be caught on video. Militants in Fallujah have boasted that they have discovered about 20 barrel bombs that did not explode on impact and are using them to make their own weapons. It was claimed in July 2014 by doctors in Fallujah that the city was being barrel-bombed three times a week and more than 600 civilians had been killed in such strikes since January. It has been claimed by an Iraqi Kurd air force pilot that the barrel bombs are produced by Iranians who then use Antonov aircraft and Huey helicopters to drop them. According to Erin Evers of Human Rights Watch, \\"What's happening now in Iraq definitely started in Syria. If I were al-Maliki, and seeing Assad next door using the same tactics without a slap on the wrist and gaining ground as a result, it stands to reason he would say, 'Why the hell not? According to residents of Tikrit, Baiji and Mosul, government forces have also dropped barrel bombs on their cities during the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive. Similar barrel bombs attacks were reported in Fallujah and the nearby town of Al- Karmah, in late July and August. On 11 September, 14 barrel bombs were dropped on Fallujah city, killing 22 civilians. According to aid workers, the Iraqi army continues to use barrel bombs extensively against ISIS-held areas, including 30 to 35 barrel bombs on Aziz Balad, a town east of Samarra. Further attacks and casualties were reported in Fallujah in June, July and August 2015. Reactions Some commentators and institutions have labeled barrel bombs as incendiary devices, which are banned for use against populated civilian areas under the terms of the UN Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons. HRW has insisted that the employment of these weapons constitutes a war crime. According to Victoria Nuland of the United States Department of State, barrel bombs are \\"incendiary bombs which contain flammable material that can be like napalm\\" or can be packed with nails and launched from the air or from a launcher. In December 2013, Russia refused to back a text at the UN Security Council that would have condemned the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for carrying out such indiscriminate attacks on civilian areas.AFP, 20 December 2013, France says Syria air strikes amount to \\"war crimes\\" On 13 January 2014, British Foreign Secretary William Hague referred to the usage of barrel bombs during the conflict as \\"yet another war crime.\\" According to Nadim Houry, the Middle East and North Africa deputy director for HRW, the reason for the Syrian government's use of barrel bombs is that it doesn't fear any strong international action. Syrian opposition representatives have repeatedly requested from international allies, and been denied, the transfer of anti- aircraft weapons to moderate rebel groups, in order to target the aircraft used to drop \\"barrel bombs\\". Chemical weapons There have been allegations of chemical weapons being delivered as barrel bombs, specifically the 11 April 2014 Kafr Zita chemical attack which saw the use of chlorine gas. Within days of the attack, analysts said they were moving towards a belief that there is \\"a coordinated chlorine campaign with growing evidence that it is the government side dropping the bombs\\". In August 2014, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) released a report detailing the use of chlorine gas as a chemical weapon used by Syrian government forces, dropped by barrel bombs from helicopters on numerous towns in Syria including Kafr Zita (April 2014), Al-Tamana'a (May 2014), Daraa (August 2014), and Jobar (August 2014). Legal status As background, to be legal under international law weapons used for aerial bombardment must comply with the principles of the laws of war: military necessity, distinction, and proportionality. An attack or action must be intended to help in the military defeat of the enemy; it must be an attack on a military objective, and the harm caused to civilians or civilian property must be proportional and not excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated. During the Syrian Civil War, in February 2014, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2139 that demanded \\"that all parties immediately cease all attacks against civilians, as well as the indiscriminate employment of weapons in populated areas, including shelling and aerial bombardment, such as the use of barrel bombs, and methods of warfare which are of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering\\".

He was a supporter of the Imperial party in its disputes with the Pope. He was involved in a war with the neighboring commune of Treviso, which was unresolved at his death. Early years Basilica of Aquileia Godfrey was of German origin, a Ghibelline from the house of Hohenstaufen. The first record of him is from 1176, when he was abbot of Sesto. This Benedictine abbey was within the jurisdiction of Aquileia. The influence of painters from Aquileia is still visible in the head and wings of an archangel that has survived in the chapel of the archangel Michael in the abbey. In 1177 he was a participant in the Treaty of Venice between the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa (r. 1155‚Äì1190) and Pope Alexander III (r. 1159‚Äì1181), which indicates he was already occupying an important position in church affairs. Patriarch Imperial affairs Godfrey succeeded Ulrico di Treven as Patriarch of Aquileia in 1182. In this role, he was legally a German prince, since Aquileia was within German territory. Godfrey was a supporter of the emperor Frederick Barbarossa. In 1183 he contracted a loan for the emperor with the Pavian family of Isembardi. This was just before the Peace of Constance, signed on 23 June 1183 between the emperor and the Italian communes, and may have been used by Frederick's envoys to sweeten the negotiations. On 27 January 1186 Godfrey crowned the emperor's son, Henry of Swabia, as King of Italy in the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio, Milan. Henry of Swabia was the future Emperor Henry VI. Godfrey's action drew the anger of the former Bishop of Milan, Pope Urban III, who felt that he should have been the one to perform the ceremony. The pope suspended Godfrey and all the ecclesiastics who attended the ceremony from divine office. This disagreement was short-lasting, and later that year when the diocese of Capodistria was established the pope stressed that it would be subordinate to Aquiliea. In 1190 the emperor Frederick Barbarossa named Godfrey the Imperial Vicar and left on the Third Crusade. Barbarossa died on 10 June 1190. Godfrey accompanied Henry VI to Rome where he was crowned emperor in April 1191. Local disputes Godfrey was temporal ruler of Friuli, Istria and Giapidia. He was the first patriarch to place his name on the coins of Aquileia, a practice that was continued by his successors. In 1183 he began a war with the neighboring commune of Treviso for control of the dioceses of Belluno, Ceneda and Feltre. In 1193 the municipality of Treviso plundered the lands of Feltre, Ceneda and Belluno. Godfrey responded by devastating seventy villages in Treviso. Godfrey died on 9 October 1194 leaving his successor, Pellegrino II, huge debts and an ongoing war with Treviso.

Taxonomy  Felis guttula was the scientific name used in 1872 by Hensel when he described a tiger cat from the jungles of the Rio Grande do Sul in southern Brazil. It was long considered to be a subspecies of the oncilla Leopardus tigrinus. It was recognized as a distinct species in 2013. It is closely related to Geoffroy's cat L. geoffroyi, with which it reportedly interbreeds in southern Brazil.  Characteristics  The small neotropical cat has a yellowish-ochre coat patterned with open black rosettes. Physically, the southern tigrina can be distinguished from the oncilla by its slightly darker background coloring, larger rosette pattern, and slightly shorter tail. However, it is extremely difficult to distinguish between the two species by appearance alone, since more genetic variation tends to occur within each species than between the two species. An adult southern tigrina weighs anywhere between .Rinaldi, A.R.; Rodriguez, F.H.; de Carvalho, A.L.; de Camargo Passos, F. (2015). \\"Feeding of small Neotropical felids (Felidae: Carnivora) and trophic niche overlap in anthropized mosaic landscape of South Brazil\\". Biotemas 28 (4): 155‚àí168. Distribution and habitat The southern tigrina occurs from central to southern Brazil in Minas Gerais and Goi√°s states, in the Atlantic forest, eastern Paraguay and northeastern Argentina below elevations of . The population is roughly estimated to comprise around 6,000 mature individuals. It inhabits dense tropical and subtropical rainforests, deciduous and mixed pine forests, open savannahs, and beach vegetation. At the margins of its range, the southern tigrina interbreeds with Geoffroy's cats, L. geoffroyi, but it does not appear to interbreed with the oncilla population in northeastern Brazil, which in contrast has a history of interbreeding with L. colocolo. Because of habitat differentiation, interbreeding does not occur between oncilla and southern tigrina. In contrast, hybridization and introgression occurs between southern tigrina and Geoffroy's cat at their contact zone in southern Brazil. Many southern tigrinas and Geoffrey's cats are thought to be partial hybrids, because of the high level of interbreeding that is occurring. Behaviour and ecology The southern tigrina preys mostly on small mammals, birds and lizards. Average prey weighs less than , but also includes larger sized prey up to . The southern tigrina often inhabits the same habitat as the ocelot. In areas with a high ocelot concentration, the southern tigrina populations are smaller, due to competition. When ocelots are scarce, it allows for smaller cat species, such as the southern tigrina, to have better opportunities for shelters, food, and territory, which therefore allows for a larger population size and density of southern tigrina. This phenomenon is called the ocelot effect. In 2015, two juvenile southern tigrinas were recorded for the first time in the Atlantic forest while learning hunting skills and capturing a cavy. The mother plays an important role in teaching her cubs how to hunt and survive in the wild. Threats During the fur trade, the southern tigrina was heavily exploited. Today, the biggest threats of the southern tigrina include habitat loss and deforestation, hunting from local people, road kills, diseases spread from domestic dogs, and the use of rodent poisoning.  Conservation  The southern tigrina occurs in protected areas, but probably at low densities. Currently, a push is on to better understand the biodiversity, ecology, evolution, and genetics of the southern tigrina to orchestrate a more effective conservation strategy for the species. In addition, further research is being conducted to better understand the special differences between oncilla and southern tigrina. Hunting is banned in Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay. Evolution A demographic expansion following the last glacial maximum (20,000 years ago) is thought to have led to the allopatric speciation of the southern tigrina.

Li Cunxin had a sour relationship with Li Cunxiao, another of Li Keyong's many adopted sons, and indirectly caused Li Cunxiao's defection. Biography Zhang Wuluo was most definitely not a Han Chinese ‚Äî he could speak 4 \\"barbarian\\" languages and read 6. He may possibly be a Uyghur, as his father, carrying the Chinese name of Zhang Junzheng (ÂºµÂêõÊîø), had been a follower of Li Sizhong, a Uyghur who submitted to the Tang Dynasty after the collapse of the Uyghur Khaganate in 840. The family moved southward in the late 840s or early 850s, settling in Heluochuan (ÂêàÁæÖÂ∑ù; probably around the Juyan Lake Basin in modern Inner Mongolia). Adept at mounted archery, he first served the elderly Shatuo commander Li Guochang, and in 882 followed Li Guochang's son Li Keyong on the southern campaign against the anti-government rebel leader Huang Chao. Through military merit, he rose to the position of chief director of armed forces (È¶¨Ê≠•ËªçÈÉΩÊåáÊèÆ‰Ωø) and was adopted by Li Keyong with the new name of Li Cunxin. In 890, Li Kuangwei from Lulong (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered in modern Beijing) invaded and conquered Yuzhou (ËîöÂ∑û, in modern Yu County, Hebei) from Li Keyong, while the Xianbei chieftain Helian Duo from Yunzhou (Èõ≤Â∑û, in modern Datong, Shanxi) also attacked with joint Tibetan and Yenisei Kirghiz forces. Li Cunxin was tasked to resist the invasion without much success. Li Keyong then sent another adopted son Li Siyuan to assist Li Cunxin, and the Shatuo forces secured a victory. With Li Keyong's main force arriving, Li Kuangwei and Helian Duo's forces withdrew. Li Cunxin was jealous of Li Keyong's massive wang Li Cunxiao and tried hard to impede all of Li Cunxiao's actions. In 891, when Li Cunxiao asked for permission to attack the warlord Wang Rong, Li Keyong initially agreed, but changed his mind when Li Cunxin advised against it. In 892, Li Cunxin was sent with Li Cunxiao for a joint attack on Wang, but as they deeply distrusted each other, neither attacked. Li Cunxin then falsely accused Li Cunxiao of being in communications with Wang. This led to Li Cunxiao's defection and eventual death. In 896, Li Cunxin was allocated 30,000 men to reinforce the warlord cousins Zhu Xuan and Zhu Jin against Li Keyong's archenemy Zhu Wen. Instead, Li Cunxin stayed behind in Weizhou (È≠èÂ∑û) and sent Li Siyuan to the front line with only 300 cavalrymen. Li Cunxin's soldiers were not disciplined and pillaged Weizhou, resulting in Weizhou/Bozhou's military governor Luo Hongxin turning against the Shatuo army and defeating Li Cunxin. Later Li Cunxin attacked Luo again and defeated Zhu Wen's general Ge Congzhou. In 897, Li Cunxin suffered a large defeat at the hands of Liu Rengong. Furious, Li Keyong almost executed him. Afterwards, Li Cunxin often used illness as an excuse to avoid battles. In 902, when Li Keyong's capital of Taiyuan was besieged by Zhu Wen's forces, Li Cunxin had proposed that they desert Taiyuan and flee to Yunzhou in the north, but Li Keyong decided against it. Li Cunxin died that year at the age of 40. In fiction Due to the role he played in Li Cunxiao's death, Li Cunxin was particularly vilified in the Yuan Dynasty play \\"A Grieving Lady Deng Painfully Laments Cunxiao\\" (ÈÑßÂ§´‰∫∫Ëã¶ÁóõÂì≠Â≠òÂ≠ù) by Guan Hanqing, which was translated as \\"Death of the Winged-Tiger General\\" by Yang Hsien-yi and Gladys Yang in 1958. (Lady Deng was the name of Li Cunxiao's wife in the play.) In this fictional play, Li Cunxiao's death was entirely brought about by Li Cunxin and Kang Junli, who had him cruelly executed behind Li Keyong's back.

In 1871, two gauge tank locomotives with a wheel arrangement were placed in service by the Cape Copper Mining Company. They were the first steam locomotives to enter service on the hitherto mule-powered Namaqualand Railway between Port Nolloth and the Namaqualand copper mines around O'okiep in the northwestern Cape of Good Hope. Cape Copper Company The Cape Copper Company had its origin in the Cape Copper Mining Company, which was established in 1862 or 1863 as the Cape of Good Hope Copper Mining Company, to take over the copper mining properties of Phillips & King, an enterprise which had been involved in copper mining in Namaqualand since the 1850s. John King, one of the members of the defunct Phillips & King, was appointed a director of the new mining company. The Cape Copper Mining Company was restructured as the Cape Copper Company in 1888. Namaqualand Railway Copper ore had to be transported by ox wagon from the mines around O'okiep to the harbour at Port Nolloth on the West Coast. The poor roads through mountainous areas hindered development of the mines and the already high transport cost was often aggravated by droughts and animal sickness. This eventually led to the decision by the mining company to build a light railway between the port and the mines, on advice from civil engineer R. Thomas Hall, Superintendent of the narrow gauge Redruth and Chacewater Railway in Cornwall.The South African Railways - Historical Survey. Editor George Hart, Publisher Bill Hart, Sponsored by Dorbyl Ltd., Published c. 1978, p. 9. The proposed construction of a narrow gauge railway in the Cape of Good Hope dates back to 1854, when the board of the Cape Town Railway and Dock Company considered a proposal to construct a railway between Port Nolloth and O'okiep in Namaqualand. Since they were not empowered to authorise such construction, the proposal was forwarded to the London board with a recommendation for its favourable consideration.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J. (1944). The Locomotive in South Africa - A Brief History of Railway Development. Chapter II - The Cape Government Railways (Continued). South African Railways and Harbours Magazine, April 1944. pp. 253-257.Lee, Charles E. (1951). The Walfish Bay Railway. Article in The Railway Magazine with which is incorporated \\"Transport & Travel Monthly\\", September 1951. Tothill Press Limited, London. pp. 627-628, 631. The first long section of the Namaqualand Railway, from Port Nolloth to Nonams, was authorised by the Cape Government under Act no. 4 of 1869 and construction of the gauge railway commenced on 4 September 1869. Anenous, to the west of Nonams, was reached on 1 January 1871. Nonams was bypassed by the railway and Steinkopf was reached in 1873. The long line between Port Nolloth and O'okiep was opened for mule traction on 1 January 1876. The line passed through sandy terrain from the coast and then made a rapid ascent of , about inland, with a very steep gradient en route in Dick's Cutting. Since the railway was to be mule-powered, it was constructed using iron bridge rails, mounted on longitudinal sleepers in order to allow free passage to the animals that worked the line. Typical mule trains were made up of ten pairs of wagons, each pair hauled by four mules harnessed in tandem. The Lilleshall locomotives Even though the Act of 1869, which authorised the construction of the first section of the railway to Nonams, near Anenous, did not provide for the use of steam power on the line, two \\"illegal\\" tank locomotives were acquired by the mining company on an experimental basis in 1871. They were built by Lilleshall Company of Oakengates in Shropshire in 1870 and 1871. To date, no photographs or drawings of either of the locomotives have been found, but they are known to have been non-identical six-wheeled side-tank engines. The first section of from Port Nolloth was only officially opened for steam traction on 1 August 1886, a further on 1 June 1887 and the line through to O‚Äôokiep on 15 March 1893. The engine John King The first locomotive, named John King after the company director and former head of the defunct Phillips & King, arrived in Port Nolloth on the ship Ocean King in December 1870 or January 1871. It was a six-coupled tank engine, which was used with a separate tender because of the shortage of water along the line. It is unclear whether the tender was also imported or constructed locally. The locomotive had cylinders of bore and stroke. The engine John King entered service on 1 February 1871, making daily round trips from Port Nolloth to the 35 Miles Station, hauling as many as ten wagons with gross train weights of 20 tons up and 35 tons down. The engine Miner The second locomotive, named Miner, arrived in September 1871. This locomotive was larger, with cylinders of bore and stroke. Apart from the cylinder size, no other details about this locomotive are known and the rest of the specifications as shown in the table are all applicable to the engine John King only. While the engine Miner was also six-wheeled, it has not been confirmed that it was also six-coupled and it could therefore possibly have been of a 0-4-2 or 2-4-0 wheel arrangement. The fact that it was larger than the engine John King, however, makes it likely that it was also of a 0-6-0 wheel arrangement. It is presumed to also have been used in a tank-and-tender configuration. Service The locomotives were less than successful. They turned out to be too light, were adversely affected by the sandy conditions and suffered frequent boiler tube failures. At one stage in 1873, only two years after entering service, both locomotives were reported as being under repair, with mules handling all traffic. Both engines were withdrawn from mainline service in 1876 and relegated to hauling ballast trains and emergency use. By 1884, the engine Miner was dismantled, awaiting boiler repairs which never happened. The engine John King was still at work in May 1887, but in July its boiler was borrowed to replace the failed boiler of the tug Nolloth. The borrowed boiler was returned in November 1887, but the engine John King was never repaired again.

Publisher and promoter James Hutchings was born in Towcester, England, and in 1848 came to the United States along with a vast wave of Europeans that were escaping a maelstrom of economic, political and religious oppression in the late 1840s. Shortly after he arrived gold was found in the Sierra Nevada, and Hutchings decided to seek his fortune. His was a common story insofar as he did not make a good living mining gold, but what little he did make he invested. In addition to attracting settlers to the west coast, the gold rush also brought technology, in particular printing presses, and Hutchings learned to make a moderately lucrative living publishing and selling letter sheets, which were printed broad sheets purposely left blank on the back so they could be used to write letters, something akin to large-format postcards. They became very popular among miners, who used them when they wrote home to friends and relatives in the east. Aside from making a living selling the letter sheets, as Hutchings traveled around California he gained a sense of what was important in the popular mind and came up with the idea of an illustrated magazine. The news of the Mariposa Battalion's incursion into a valley (that the battalion members named Yosemite) for the purpose of tracking down alleged renegade Indians was fairly widely published, but the news focused on the confrontation. Hutchings was one of the few people to note the mention of a 1000 foot waterfall, and in 1854 when he was first formulating the idea of his illustrated magazine, he decided that a trip into that valley might make for interesting stories in the inaugural issue of the magazine. In the late spring of 1855 he hired artists to join him, and when the party arrived in the foothills he hired two Mi-Wuk men as guides. As the party came around Inspiration Point, they stopped long enough for Thomas Ayres to get a detailed sketch, which was published as a lithographic poster that fall, the first published image of Yosemite Valley. In June 1856, the entire account was published in Volume I of the magazine, and included five of Ayres' drawings. The magazine was published monthly from July 1856 to June 1861, five volumes total. Although Yosemite was prominent, it was a magazine of general interest that focused on California's nascent tourist attractions. Each issue contained travel narratives, ranging from simple day trips out of San Francisco to arduous trans-Sierra treks. Longer articles were interspersed with shorter and lighter pieces, such as poetry and tables of interesting facts. The magazine popularized a number of well-known legendary stories of the West including the Pony Express, Grizzly Adams and Snowshoe Thompson. The story of the naming of Yosemite was first published in the magazine in an article by Lafayette Bunnell.

Early life  Dobrivoje Bo≈æiƒá was born in Ra≈°ka in the Kingdom of Serbia. He studied in Germany at the Technical University of Karlsruhe and Dresden. While at Karlsruhe, he was a student of Rudolf Diesel, the inventor of diesel engines. After graduation in 1911, Bo≈æiƒá returned to Serbia.  Career  Detail of brake distributor Bo≈æiƒç with lever for changing the braking force according to load. His engineering work began immediately upon his return to the railway workshop in Ni≈°. He simultaneously started his research in the field of railway braking. Bo≈æiƒá learned that the brake system that rail vehicles used was one of the most problematic parts of vehicle development, due to trains' increasing speed and mass. In 1869, George Westinghouse designed a brake on compressed air with direct action and improved it in 1872, producing a single-chamber, automatic brake with indirect effects. Bo≈æiƒá's research was interrupted during the First World War. After the war, he worked in Kraljevo, Belgrade and Zagreb. He applied to the International Union of Railways for a patent for the Bo≈æiƒá brake through the Yugoslav railway in 1925. His patent was approved in 1928. Bo≈æiƒá's invention resolved then unsolvable problems, such as solutions distributor (main braking device). Three working pressures increased air velocity stab in the main air pipe (along the train) from He invented solutions to the problem of gradual release brake, non-exhaustion during braking, an overfull working chamber, load-adaptive braking. He first proposed braking of passenger trains as a function of speed (brakes with two working pressure). He also constructed an efficient brake controller for locomotives. After World War II, he lived and worked in the United States. In 1964, he returned to Belgrade, where he died in 1967.

He reinforced central authority and forced his subjects to accept Christianity. Although all written sources emphasize only the role played by German and Italian knights and clerics in the process, a significant part of the Hungarian vocabulary for agriculture, religion and state was taken from Slavic languages. Civil wars and pagan uprisings, along with attempts by the Holy Roman Emperors to expand their authority over Hungary, jeopardized the new monarchy. The monarchy stabilized during the reigns of Ladislaus I (1077‚Äì1095) and Coloman (1095‚Äì1116). These rulers occupied Croatia and Dalmatia with the support of a part of the local population. Both realms retained their autonomous position. The successors of Ladislaus and Coloman‚Äîespecially B√©la II (1131‚Äì1141), B√©la III (1176‚Äì1196), Andrew II (1205‚Äì1235), and B√©la IV (1235‚Äì1270)‚Äîcontinued this policy of expansion towards the Balkan Peninsula and the lands east of the Carpathian Mountains, transforming their kingdom into one of the major powers of medieval Europe. Rich in uncultivated lands, silver, gold, and salt deposits, Hungary became the preferred destination of mainly German, Italian and French colonists. These immigrants were mostly peasants who settled in villages, but craftsmen and merchants also came, who established most cities of the Kingdom. Their arrival had a key role in the shaping of an urban lifestyle, habits and culture in medieval Hungary. The location of the kingdom at the crossroads of international trade routes favored the coexistence of several cultures. Romanesque, Gothic and Renaissance buildings and literary works written in Latin prove the predominantly Roman Catholic character of the culture, but Orthodox, and even non-Christian ethnic minority communities also existed. Latin was the language of legislation, administration and judiciary, but \\"linguistic pluralism\\" contributed to the survival of many tongues, including a great variety of Slavic dialects. The predominance of royal estates initially assured the sovereign's preeminent position, but the alienation of royal lands gave rise to the emergence of a self-conscious group of lesser landholders, known as \\"royal servants\\". They forced Andrew II to issue his Golden Bull of 1222, \\"one of first examples of constitutional limits being placed on the powers of a European monarch\\" (Francis Fukuyama). The kingdom received a major blow from the Mongol invasion of 1241‚Äì42. Thereafter, Cuman and Jassic groups settled in the central lowlands, and colonists arrived from Moravia, Poland and other nearby countries. The erection of fortresses by landlords, promoted by the monarchs after the withdrawal of the Mongols, led to the development of semi- autonomous \\"provinces\\" dominated by powerful magnates. Some of these magnates even challenged the authority of Andrew III (1290‚Äì1301), the last male descendant of the native √Årp√°d dynasty. His death was followed by a period of interregnum and anarchy. Central power was re-established only in the early 1320s. Background The Hungarians, or Magyars, conquered the Carpathian Basin at the turn of the 9th and 10th centuries. Here they found a predominantly Slavic-speaking population. From their new homeland, they launched plundering raids against East Francia, Italy and other regions of Europe. Their raids were halted by Otto I, future Holy Roman Emperor, who defeated them at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955. Hungarians lived in patrilineal families, which were organized into clans that formed tribes. The tribal confederation was headed by the grand prince, always a member of the family descending from √Årp√°d, the Hungarians' leader around the time of their \\"land-taking\\". Contemporary authors described the Hungarians as nomads, but Ibn Rusta and others added that they also cultivated arable land. The great number of borrowings from Slavic languagesFor example, cseresznye (\\"cherry\\"), iga (\\"yoke\\"), kov√°cs (\\"blacksmith\\"), ablak (\\"window\\"), patk√≥ (\\"horseshoe\\"), and b√°lv√°ny (\\"idol\\") (Engel 2001, pp. 44., 57.). prove that the Hungarians adopted new techniques and a more settled lifestyle in Central Europe. The cohabitation of Hungarians and local ethnic groups is also reflected in the assemblages of the \\"Bijelo Brdo culture\\", which emerged in the mid-10th century. Although they were pagan, the Hungarians demonstrated a tolerant attitude towards Christians, Jews, and Muslims. The Byzantine Church was the first to successfully proselytize among their leaders: in 948 the horka, and around 952 the gyula, were baptized in Constantinople. In contrast, the grand prince G√©za (c. 970‚Äì997) received baptism according to the Latin rite. He erected fortresses and invited foreign warriors to develop a new army based on heavy cavalry. G√©za also arranged the marriage of his son, Stephen, with Giselle of Bavaria, a princess from the family of the Holy Roman Emperors. When G√©za died in 997, his son had to fight for his succession with Kopp√°ny, the eldest member of the House of √Årp√°d. Assisted by German heavy cavalry, Stephen emerged the victor in the decisive battle in 998. He applied for a royal crown to Pope Sylvester II, who granted his request with the consent of Emperor Otto III. \\"Patrimonial\\" kingdom King St Stephen (10001038) Stephen was crowned the first king of Hungary on either December 25, 1000, or January 1, 1001. He consolidated his rule through a series of wars against semi-independent local rulers, including his maternal uncle, Gyula. He proved his kingdom's military strength when he repelled an invasion by Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor, in 1030. Marshlands, other natural obstacles, and barricades made of stone, earth or timber provided defense at the kingdom's borders. A wide zone known as gyep√º was intentionally left uninhabited for defensive purposes along the frontiers. Most of the early medieval fortresses in Hungary were made of earth and timber. St Stephen and his wife founding a church at √ìbuda Stephen I's views on state administration were summarized around 1015 in a work known as Admonitions. Stating that \\"the country that has only one language and one custom is weak and fragile\\", he emphasized the advantages of the arrival of foreigners, or \\"guests\\". Stephen I developed a state similar to the monarchies of contemporary Western Europe. Counties, the basic units of administration, were districts organized around fortresses and headed by royal officials known as isp√°ns, or counts. Stephen I founded dioceses and at least one archbishopric, and established Benedictine monasteries. He prescribed that every tenth village was to build a parish church. The earliest churches of the 10th century were simple wood constructions, but the royal basilica at Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r was built in Romanesque style. Stephen I's laws were aimed at the adoption, even by force, of a Christian way of life. He especially protected Christian marriage against polygamy and other traditional customs. Decorated belts and other items of pagan fashion also disappeared. Commoners started to wear long woolen coats, but wealthy men persisted with their silk kaftans decorated with furs. From a legal perspective, Hungarian society was divided into freemen and serfs, but intermediate groups also existed. All freemen had the legal capacity to own property, to sue and to be sued. Most of them were bound to the monarch or to a wealthier landlord, and only \\"guests\\" could freely move. Among freemen living in lands attached to a fortress, the \\"castle warriors\\" served in the army, and the \\"castle folk\\" cultivated the lands, forged weapons or rendered other services. All freemen were to pay a special tax, the \\"freemen's pennies\\" to the monarchs. With a transitory status between freemen and serfs, peasants known as udvornici were exempt from it. Serfs theoretically lacked the legal status available to freemen, but in practice they had their own property: they cultivated their masters' land with their own tools, and kept 50‚Äì66 percent of the harvest for themselves. Stephen I's laws and charters suggest that most commoners lived in sedentary communities which formed villages. An average village was made up of no more than 40 semi-sunken timber huts with a corner hearth. Many of the villages were named after a profession,For example, F√∂d√©mes (\\"beekeeper\\"), H√≥d√°sz (\\"beaver hunter\\"), Gerencs√©r (\\"potter\\"), and Tasz√°r (\\"carpenter\\") (Engel 2001, p. 59.). implying that the villagers were required to render a specific service to their lords. Pagan revolts, wars and consolidation (1038‚Äì1116) St Emeric Stephen I survived his son, Emeric, which caused a four-decade crisis. Stephen considered his cousin, Vazul, unsuitable for the throne and named his own sister's son, the Venetian Peter Orseolo, as his heir. After Vazul was blinded and his three sons were expelled, Peter succeeded his uncle without opposition in 1038. Peter's preference for his foreign courtiers led to a rebellion, which ended with his deposition in favor of a native lord, Samuel Aba, who was related to the royal family. Supported by Emperor Henry III, Peter Orseolo returned and expelled Samuel Aba in 1044. During his second rule, he accepted the emperor's suzerainty. His rule ended with a new rebellion, on this occasion aimed at the restoration of paganism. There were many lords who opposed the destruction of the Christian monarchy. They proposed the crown to Andrew, one of Vazul's sons, who returned to Hungary, defeated Peter and suppressed the pagans in 1046. His cooperation with his brother, B√©la, a talented military commander, ensured the Hungarians' victory over Emperor Henry III, who attempted to conquer the kingdom two times: in 1050 and 1053. A new civil war broke out when Duke B√©la claimed the crown for himself in 1059, but his three sons accepted the rule of Solomon, Andrew I's son, in 1063. Initially, the young king and his cousins cooperated; for instance, they jointly defeated the Pechenegs plundering Transylvania in 1068. The power conflict in the royal family caused a new civil war in 1071. It lasted up to Solomon's abdication in favor of one of his cousins, Ladislaus, in the early 1080s. King Ladislaus promulgated laws that prescribed draconian punishments against criminals. His laws also regulated the payment of customs duties, of tolls payable at fairs and fords, and of the tithes. He forbade Jews from holding Christian serfs, and introduced laws aiming at the conversion of local Muslims, who were known as B√∂sz√∂rm√©nys. Zadar, a Dalmatian town accepting King Coloman's suzerainty The death of Ladislaus' brother-in-law, King Zvonimir of Croatia, in 1089 or 1090 created an opportunity for him to claim Croatia for himself. Ladislaus' sister, Helena, and several noblemen (mainly from northern Croatia) supported Ladislaus' claim. His troops occupied the lowlands, but a native claimant, Petar Svaƒçiƒá, resisted in the Petrova Mounts. Nevertheless, Croatia and Hungary remained closely connected for more than nine centuries. Ladislaus I appointed his nephew, √Ålmos, to administer Croatia. Although a younger son, √Ålmos was also favored against his brother, Coloman, when the king was thinking of his succession. Even so, Coloman succeeded his uncle in 1095, while √Ålmos received a separate duchy under his brother's suzerainty. Throughout Coloman's reign, the brothers' relationship remained tense, which finally led to the blinding of √Ålmos and his infant son. Coloman routed two bands of crusaders (the perpetrators of the Rhineland massacres) who were plundering the Western borderlands and defeated Petar Svaƒçiƒá in Croatia. The late 14th-century Pacta conventa states that Coloman was crowned king of Croatia after concluding an agreement with twelve local noblemen. Although most probably a forgery, the document reflects the actual status of Croatia proper, which was never incorporated into Hungary. In contrast, the region known as Slavonia, between the Petrova Mounts and the river Dr√°va, became closely connected to Hungary. Here many Hungarian noblemen received land grants from the monarchs. Zadar, Split and other Dalmatian towns also accepted Coloman's suzerainty in 1105, but their right to elect their own bishops and leaders remained unchained. In Croatia and Slavonia, the sovereign was represented by governors bearing the title ban. Likewise, a royal official, the voivode, administered Transylvania, the eastern borderland of the kingdom. The Kingdom of Hungary in the 1090s Like Ladislaus I, Coloman proved to be a great legislator, but he prescribed less severe punishments than his uncle had done. He ordered that transactions between Christians and Jews were to be put into writing. His laws concerning his Muslim subjects aimed at their conversion, for instance, by obliging them to marry their daughters to Christians. The presence of Jewish and Muslim merchants in the kingdom was due to its role as a crossroad of trading routes leading towards Constantinople, Regensburg and Kiev. Local trade also existed, which enabled Coloman to collect the , the traditional in-kind tax of Slavonia, in cash. The kingdom was sparsely populated, with an average population density of four or five people per . The Olaszi streets or districts in Eger, P√©cs and Nagyv√°rad (Oradea, Romania) point at the presence of \\"guests\\" speaking a Western Romance language, while the N√©meti and Sz√°szi place names refer to German-speaking colonists throughout the entire kingdom. Most subjects of the early medieval Hungarian monarchs were peasants. They only cultivated the most fertile lands, and moved further when the lands became exhausted. Wheat was the most widely produced crop, but barley, the raw material for home brew, was also grown. Even peasants were allowed to hunt and fish in the royal forests that covered large territories in the kingdom. Animal husbandry remained an important sector of agriculture, and millet and oats were produced for fodder. Colonisation and expansion (11161196) Unsuccessful wars with the Republic of Venice, the Byzantine Empire and other neighboring states characterized the reign of Coloman's son, Stephen II, who succeeded his father in 1116. The earliest mention of the Sz√©kelys is in connection with the young king's first war against the Duchy of Bohemia. The Hungarian-speaking Sz√©kelys lived in scattered communities along the borders, but their groups were moved to the easternmost regions of Transylvania in the 12th century. Stephen II died childless in 1131. During the reign of the blind B√©la II, the kingdom was administered by his wife, Helena of Serbia, who ordered the massacre of the lords who had opposed her husband's rule. Boris Kalamanos, an alleged son of King Coloman, who attempted to seize the throne from B√©la II, received no internal support. Leutschau (, ), a center of Zipser Saxons B√©la II's son, G√©za II, who ascended the throne in 1141, adopted an active foreign policy. He supported Uro≈° II of Serbia against Emperor Manuel I Komnenos. He promoted the colonization of the border zones. Flemish, German, Italian, and Walloon \\"guests\\" arrived in great numbers and settled in the Szepess√©g region (Spi≈°, Slovakia) and in southern Transylvania. G√©za even recruited Muslim warriors in the Pontic steppes to serve in his army. Abu Hamid, a Muslim traveler from Al- Andaluz, refers to mountains that \\"contain lots of silver and gold\\", which points at the importance of mining and gold panning already around 1150. G√©za II was succeeded in 1162 by his eldest son, Stephen III. His uncles, Ladislaus II and Stephen IV, claimed the crown for themselves. Emperor Manuel I Komnenos took advantage of the internal conflicts and forced the young king to cede Dalmatia and the Szer√©ms√©g region (Srem, Serbia) to the Byzantines in 1165. Stephen III set an example for the development of towns by granting liberties to the Walloon \\"guests\\" in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r, including immunity from the jurisdiction of the local isp√°n. When Stephen III died childless in 1172, his brother, B√©la III, ascended the throne. He reconquered Dalmatia and the Szer√©ms√©g in the 1180s. A contemporary list shows that more than 50 percent of his revenues derived from the annual renewal of the silver currency, and from tolls, ferries and markets. According to the list, his total income was the equivalent of 32 tonnes of silver per year, but this number is clearly exaggerated. B√©la III emphasized the importance of making records on judicial proceedings, which substantiates reports in later Hungarian chronicles' of his order regarding the obligatory use of written petitions. Landowners also started to put their transactions into writing, which led to the appearance of the so-called \\"places of authentication\\", such as cathedral chapters and monasteries authorized to issue deeds. Their emergence also evidences the employment of an educated staff. Indeed, students from the kingdom studied at the universities of Paris, Oxford, Bologna and Padua from the 1150s. Aspects of 12th-century French culture could also be detected in B√©la III's kingdom. His palace at Esztergom was built in the early Gothic style. Achilles and other names known from the Legend of Troy and the Romance of Alexander (two emblematic works of chivalric culture) were also popular among Hungarian aristocrats. According to a scholarly view, \\"Master P\\", the author of the Gesta Hungarorum, a chronicle on the Hungarian \\"land-taking\\", was B√©la III's notary. Development of the Estates of the realm Age of Golden Bulls (11961241) Romanesque church of J√°k Hermannstadt (, ), the center of the Transylvanian Saxons B√©la III's son and successor, Emeric, had to face revolts stirred up by his younger brother, Andrew. Furthermore, incited by Enrico Dandolo, Doge of Venice, the armies of the Fourth Crusade took Zadar in 1202. Emeric was succeeded in 1204 by his infant son, Ladislaus III. When the young king died in a year, his uncle, Andrew, mounted the throne. Stating that \\"the best measure of a royal grant is its being immeasurable\\", he distributed large parcels of royal lands among his partisans. Freemen living in former royal lands lost their direct contact to the sovereign, which threatened their legal status. Royal revenues decreased, which led to the introduction of new taxes and their farming out to Muslims and Jews. The new methods of raising funds for the royal treasury created widespread unrest. Andrew II was strongly influenced by his wife, Gertrude of Merania. She openly expressed her preference for her German compatriots, which led to her assassination by a group of local lords in 1213. A new uprising broke out while the king was in the Holy Land on his crusade in 1217 and 1218. Finally, a movement of the royal servants, who were actually free landholders directly subordinated to the sovereign, obliged Andrew II to issue his Golden Bull in 1222. It summarized the royal servants' liberties, including their tax exemption. Its last provision authorized the secular and spiritual lords to \\"resist and speak against\\" the sovereign \\"without the charge of high treason\\".The Laws of the Medieval Kingdom of Hungary, 1000‚Äì1301 (1222:31), p. 35. The Golden Bull also prohibited the employment of Muslims and Jews in royal administration. This ban was confirmed when Andrew II, urged by the prelates, issued the Golden Bull's new variant in 1231, which authorized the archbishop of Esztergom to excommunicate him in case of his departure from its provisions. For non- Christians who continued to be employed in the royal household, Archbishop Robert of Esztergom placed the kingdom under interdict in 1232. Andrew II was forced to take an oath, which included his promise to respect the privileged position of clergymen and to dismiss all his Jewish and Muslim officials. A growing intolerance against non-Catholics is also demonstrated by the transfer of the Orthodox monastery of Visegr√°d to the Benedictines in 1221. Andrew II made several attempts to occupy the neighboring Principality of Halych. His son, B√©la, persuaded a group of Cumans to accept Andrew II's suzerainty in 1228 and established a new march in Oltenia (known as the Banate of Sz√∂r√©ny) in 1231. B√©la IV succeeded his father in 1235. His attempt to reacquire crown lands alienated by his predecessors created a deep rift between the monarch and the lords just as the Mongols were sweeping westward across the Eurasian steppes. The king was first informed of the Mongol threat by Friar Julian, a Dominican friar who had visited a Hungarian-speaking population in Magna Hungaria, in 1235. In the next years, the Mongols routed the Cumans who dominated the western parts of the Eurasian steppes. A Cuman chieftain, Kuthen, agreed to accept B√©la IV's supremacy; thus he and his people were allowed to settle in the Great Hungarian Plain. The Cumans' nomadic lifestyle caused many conflicts with local communities. The locals even considered them as the Mongols' allies. Mongol invasion (12411242) Batu Khan, who was the commander of the Mongol armies invading Eastern Europe, demanded B√©la IV's surrender without a fight in 1240. The king refused, and ordered his barons to assemble with their retinue in his camp at Pest. Here, a riot broke out against the Cumans and the mob massacred the Cuman leader, Kuthen. The Cumans soon departed and pillaged the central parts of the kingdom. The main Mongol army arrived through the northeastern passes of the Carpathian Mountains in March 1241. Royal troops met the enemy forces at the river Saj√≥, where the Mongols won a decisive victory in the battle of Mohi on April 11, 1241. From the battlefield, B√©la IV fled first to Austria, where Duke Frederick II held him for ransom. Thereafter, the king and his family found refuge in Klis Fortress in Dalmatia. The Mongols first occupied and thoroughly plundered the territories east of the river Danube. They crossed the river when it was frozen in early 1242. A contemporary account by Abbot Hermann of Niederalteich stated that \\"the Kingdom of Hungary, which had existed for 350 years, was destroyed\\". The kingdom continued to exist. Batu Khan withdrew his entire army when he was informed of the death of the Great Khan √ñg√∂dei in March 1242. Nevertheless, the invasion and the famine that followed it had catastrophic demographic consequences. At least 15 percent of the population died or disappeared. Transcontinental trading routes disintegrated, causing the decline of B√°cs (Baƒç, Serbia), Ungv√°r (Uzhhorod, Ukraine) and other traditional centers of commerce. Local Muslim communities also disappeared, indicating they had suffered especially heavy losses during the invasion. Small villages also disappeared, but archaeological data indicate that the total destruction of settlements was less often than it used to be assumed. The abandonment of most villages, well-documented from the second half of the 13th century, was the consequence of a decades-long integration process with peasants moving from the small villages to larger settlements. Last √Årp√°ds (12421301) After the Mongol withdrawal, B√©la IV abandoned his policy of recovering former crown lands. Instead, he granted large estates to his supporters, and urged them to construct stone-and-mortar castles. He initiated a new wave of colonization that resulted in the arrival of a number of Germans, Moravians, Poles, and Romanians. The king re-invited the Cumans and settled them in the plains along the Danube and the Tisza. A group of Alans, the ancestors of the Jassic people, seems to have settled in the kingdom around the same time. New villages appeared, consisting of timber houses built side by side in equal parcels of land. For instance, the scarcely inhabited forests of the Western Carpathians (in present-day Slovakia) developed a network of settlements under B√©la IV. Huts disappeared, and new rural houses consisting of a living room, a kitchen and a pantry were built. The most advanced agricultural techniques, including asymmetric heavy ploughs, also spread throughout the kingdom. Internal migration was likewise instrumental in the development of the new domains emerging in former royal lands. The new landholders granted personal freedom and more favorable financial conditions to those who arrived in their estates, which also enabled the peasants who decided not to move to improve their position. B√©la IV granted privileges to more than a dozen towns, including Nagyszombat (Trnava, Slovakia) and Pest. Although threatening letters sent to B√©la IV by the khans of the Golden Horde proved that the danger of a new Mongol invasion still existed, he adopted an expansionist foreign policy. Frederick II of Austria died fighting against Hungarian troops in 1246, and B√©la IV's son-in-law, Rostislav Mikhailovich, annexed large territories along the kingdom's southern frontiers. Conflicts between the elderly monarch and his heir, Stephen, caused a civil war in the 1260s. Local autonomies in the Kingdom of Hungary (late 1200s) B√©la IV and his son jointly confirmed the liberties of the royal servants and started referring to them as noblemen in 1267. By that time, \\"true noblemen\\" were legally differentiated from other landholders. They held their estates free from any obligation, but everybody else (even the ecclesiastic nobles, Romanian knezes and other \\"conditional nobles\\") owed services to their lords in exchange for the lands they held. In a growing number of counties, local nobility acquired the right to elect four \\"judges of the nobles\\" to represent them in official procedures (or two, in Transylvania and Slavonia). The idea of equating the Hungarian \\"nation\\" with the community of noblemen also emerged in this period. It was first expressed in Simon of K√©za's Gesta Hungarorum, a chronicle written in the 1280s. The wealthiest landholders forced the lesser nobles to join their retinue, which increased their power. One of the barons, Joachim of the Gutkeled clan, even captured Stephen V's heir, the infant Ladislaus, in 1272. Stephen V died some months later, causing a new civil war between the Cs√°k, K≈ëszegi, and other leading families who attempted to control the central government in the name of the young Ladislaus IV. He was declared to be of age in 1277 at an assembly of the spiritual and temporal lords and of the noblemen's and Cumans' representatives, but he could not strengthen royal authority. Ladislaus IV, whose mother, Elisabeth, was a Cuman chieftain's daughter, preferred his Cuman kin, which made him unpopular. He was even accused of initiating a second Mongol invasion in 1285, although the invaders were routed by the royal troops. When Ladislaus IV was murdered in 1290, the Holy See declared the kingdom a vacant fief. Although Rome granted the kingdom to his sister's son, Charles Martel, crown prince of the Kingdom of Naples, the majority of the Hungarian lords chose Andrew, the grandson of Andrew II and son of a prince of dubious legitimacy. Andrew became the first monarch to take an oath respecting the liberties of the Church and the nobility before his coronation. He regularly convoked the prelates, the lords and the noblemen's representatives to assemblies known as Diets, which started to develop into a legislative body. By 1300, when the kingdom had disintegrated into autonomous provinces ruled by powerful noblemen (including Matthew Cs√°k, Ladislaus K√°n, and Amadeus Aba), the Croatian lord, Paul I ≈†ubiƒá of Bribir, dared to invite the late Charles Martel's son, the twelve-year-old Charles Robert, to Hungary. The young pretender was marching from Croatia towards Buda when Andrew III unexpectedly died on January 14, 1301. Aftermath With Andrew III's death, the male line of the House of √Årp√°d became extinct, and a period of anarchy began. Charles Robert was crowned king with a provisional crown, but most lords and bishops refused to yield to him because they regarded him as a symbol of the Holy See's attempts to control Hungary. They elected king the twelve-year-old Wenceslaus of Bohemia, who was descended from B√©la IV of Hungary in the female line. The young king could not consolidate his position because many lords, especially those who held domains in the southern region of the kingdom, continued to support Charles Robert. Wenceslaus left Hungary for Bohemia in mid-1304. After he inherited Bohemia in 1305, he abandoned his claim to Hungary in favor of Otto III, Duke of Bavaria. Otto, who was a grandson of B√©la IV of Hungary, was crowned king, but only the K≈ëszegis and the Transylvanian Saxons regarded him as the lawful monarch. He was captured in Transylvania by Ladislaus K√°n, who forced him to leave Hungary. The majority of the lords and prelates elected Charles Robert king at a Diet on October 10, 1307. He was crowned king with the Holy Crown of Hungary in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r by the Archbishop of Esztergom, as required by customary law, on August 27, 1310. During the next decade, he launched a series of military campaigns against the oligarchs to restore royal authority. Charles Robert reunited the kingdom after the death of the most powerful lord, Mattheus Cs√°k, which enabled him to conquer Cs√°k's large province in the northeast of Hungary in 1321.

Royal power was restored under Charles I (1308-1342), a scion of the Capetian House of Anjou. Gold and silver mines opened in his reign produced about one third of the world's total production up until the 1490s. The kingdom reached the peak of its power under Louis the Great (1342-1382) who led military campaigns against Lithuania, southern Italy and other faraway territories. The expansion of the Ottoman Empire reached the kingdom under Sigismund of Luxemburg (1387-1437). In the next decades, a talented military commander, John Hunyadi, directed the fight against the Ottomans. His victory at N√°ndorfeh√©rv√°r (present-day Belgrade, Serbia) in 1456 stabilized the southern frontiers for more than half a century. The first king of Hungary without dynastic ancestry was Matthias Corvinus (1458‚Äì1490), who led several successful military campaigns and also became the King of Bohemia and the Duke of Austria. With his patronage Hungary became the first country which adopted the Renaissance from Italy. Background The Kingdom of Hungary came into being when Stephen I, grand prince of the Hungarians, was crowned king in 1000 or 1001. He reinforced central authority and forced his subjects to accept Christianity. Although written sources emphasize the role played by German and Italian knights and clerics in the process, a significant part of the Hungarian vocabulary for agriculture, religion and state was taken from Slavic languages. Civil wars, pagan uprisings and the Holy Roman Emperors' unsuccessful attempts to expand their authority over Hungary jeopardized the new monarchy. Its position stabilized under Ladislaus I (1077-1095) and Coloman (1095-1116). Following the succession crisis in Croatia as a result of their campaign the Kingdom of Croatia entered a personal union with the Kingdom of Hungary in 1102. Both them were regarded as a successor by hereditary rightsM√°rta Font - Ugarsko Kraljevstvo i Hrvatska u srednjem vijeku (Hungarian Kingdom and Croatia in the Middle Ages), p. 8-9 Coloman was crowned in Biograd in 1102 and the title now claimed by Coloman was \\"King of Hungary, Dalmatia, and Croatia\\". Rich in uncultivated lands and in silver, gold, and salt deposits, the kingdom became a preferred target of the continuous immigration of mainly German, Italian and French colonists. The colonists were mostly peasants who settled in villages, but also large number of townsfolk arrived as craftsmen and merchants. Their arrival contributed to the development of Esztergom, Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r and many other cities and large number of villages in various parts of the Kingdom. Situated at the crossroads of international trade routes, Hungary was affected by several cultural trends. Romanesque, Gothic and Renaissance buildings, and literary works written in Latin prove the predominantly Roman Catholic character of the culture of the Kingdom, but Orthodox, and even non-Christian ethnic minority communities also existed. Latin was the language of legislation, administration and judiciary, but \\"linguistic pluralism\\" (J√°nos M. Bak)Bak 1993, p. 269. contributed to the survival of a number of tongues, including a great variety of Slavic dialects. Oligarchs controlled parts of the Kingdom during the interregnum The predominance of royal estates initially ensured the sovereign's preeminent position, but the alienation of royal lands gave rise to the emergence of a self-conscious group of lesser landholders. They forced Andrew II to issue his Golden Bull of 1222, \\"one of first examples of constitutional limits being placed on the powers of a European monarch\\" (Francis Fukuyama). The kingdom received a major blow from the Mongol invasion of 1241‚Äì1242. Thereafter Cuman and Jassic groups were settled in the central lowlands and colonists arrived from Moravia, Poland and other nearby countries. Interregnum (1301-1323) Holy Crown of Hungary Andrew III died on January 14, 1301.Kontler 1999, p. 84. His death created an opportunity for about a dozen lords, or \\"oligarchs\\", who had by that time achieved de facto independence of the monarch to strengthen their autonomy.Engel 2001, p. 111., 124. They acquired all royal castles in a number of counties where everybody was obliged either to accept their supremacy or to leave.Makkai 1994, p. 34. For instance,Matthew III Cs√°k ruled over fourteen counties in the lands now forming Slovakia,Kirschbaum 2005, pp. 44-45. Ladislaus K√°n administered Transylvania, and Ugrin Cs√°k controlled large territories between the rivers Sz√°va and Dr√°va.Engel 2001, p. 126. In Croatia the situation for the crown became even more dire, as viceroy Paul ≈†ubiƒá and the Baboniƒá family achieved de facto independence, with Paul ≈†ubiƒá even minting his own coin and being called by contemporary Croatian historians as the \\"uncrowned king of the Croats\\". At the news of Andrew III's death, viceroy ≈†ubiƒá invited Charles of Anjou, the late Charles Martel's son, to claim the throne, who hurried to Esztergom where he was crowned king.Engel 2001, p. 128. However, most secular lords opposed his rule and proposed the throne to King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia's namesake son.Kontler 1999, p. 87. The young Wenceslaus could not strengthen his positionEngel 2001, p. 129. and renounced in favor of Otto III, Duke of Bavaria in 1305. The latter was forced to leave the kingdom in 1307 by Ladislaus K√°n.Engel 2001, p. 130. A papal legate persuaded all the lords to accept Charles of Anjou's rule in 1310, but most territories remained out of royal control.Makkai 1994, p. 37. Assisted by the prelates and a growing number of lesser nobles, Charles I launched a series of expeditions against the great lords.Engel 2001, p. 132. Taking advantage of the lack of unity among them, he defeated them one by one.Kontler 1999, p. 88. He won his first victory in the battle of Rozgony (present-day Rozhanovce, Slovakia) in 1312.Engel 2001, p. 131.Makkai 1994, pp. 37-38. However, the most powerful lord, Matthew Cs√°k preserved his autonomy up until his death in 1321, while the Baboniƒá and ≈†ubiƒá families were only subjugated in 1323.Engel 2001, p. 133. The Angevins' monarchy (1323-1382) Charles I introduced a centralized power structure in the 1320s.Engel 2001, p. 140. Stating that \\"his words has the force of law\\", he never again convoked the Diet. Even his most faithful partisans depended on revenues from their temporary honours,Moln√°r 2001, p. 46. because the king rarely made land grants.Kontler 1999, p. 89. This practice ensured the loyalty of the Drugeths, Lackfis, Sz√©cs√©nyis and other families who emerged in his reign. Kremnitz (, ), a mining town founded by German miners from Bohemia forint The king even afforded to grant privileges which contradicted customary law.Engel 2001, p. 141. For instance, he occasionally authorized daughters of noblemen to inherit their fathers' estates, although local customs required that a deceased nobleman's inherited lands were to be transferred to his agnates in lack of a son.Rady 2000, pp. 107-109. Nevertheless, Roman law never replaced customary which gave rise to the appearance of lay officials who possessed \\"a good command of Latin and a fair knowledge of common law\\" (P√°l Engel).Engel 2001, pp. 192-193. Charles I reformed the system of royal revenues and monopolies.Kontler 1999, p. 90. For instance, he imposed the \\"thirtieth\\" (a tax on goods transferred through the kingdom's frontiers), and authorized landholders to retain one third of the income from mines opened in their estates.Engel 2001, pp. 155-156. The new mines produced around of gold and of silver annually, which made up more than 30 percent of the world's production up until the Spanish conquest of the Americas in the 1490s. However, most profits from the mines were transferred to Italian and South German merchants, because the value of imported fine textiles and other goods always exceeded the price of cattle and wine exported from the kingdom.Bak 1994, p. 58. Charles I also ordered the minting of stable golden coins modelled on the florin of Florence.Sedlar 1994, p. 346. His ban on trading with uncoined gold produced shortage in the European market which lasted until his death in 1342.Sedlar 1994, p. 348. Thereafter his widow, Elisabeth of Poland transported enormous quantities of gold to Italy in order to promote the claim of their younger son, Andrew to the Kingdom of Naples. Andrew who was Queen Joanna I of Naples's consort was assassinated in 1345.Engel 2001, p. 159. His brother, Louis I of Hungary accused the queen of his murder and led two campaigns against her in 1347 and 1350.Engel 2001, pp. 159-160. Although he twice conquered her kingdom,Moln√°r 2001, p. 50. she regained it on both occasions.Moln√°r 2001, p. 51. The first campaign against Naples was abandoned because of the arrival of the \\"Black Death\\".Kontler 1999, p. 93. In Hungary, fewer locals fell victim to the epidemic than in Western Europe, because the kingdom was still an underpopulated territory with well nourished inhabitants.Engel 2001, p. 161. Indeed, colonization also continued in the 14th century.Engel 2001, p. 269. The new settlers mainly came from Moravia, Poland and other neighboring countries.Engel 2001, p. 270. They were customarily exempted of taxation for 16 years, which is reflected by the lehota (\\"lightening\\") placenames in present-day Slovakia.Engel 2001, pp. 269-270. Earlier distinctions between freemen, serfs and udvornici disappeared in the 14th century, because all peasants had acquired the right to free movement by the 1350s.Kontler 1999, p. 97. Most of them cultivated well defined parcels with a hereditary right to use it for a rent in cash and in- kind \\"gifts\\" due to the landowner.Kontler 1999, p. 98. The legal position of \\"true noblemen\\" was also standardized when the idea of \\"one and the same liberty\\" was enacted in 1351.Engel 2001, p. 175. For instance, all noblemen received the right to \\"adjudicate all offences committed\\" by the peasants living in their estates (Martyn Rady).Rady 2000, pp. 57-58. Privilegium pro Slavis (1381) Louis I the Great in Zadar in Dalmatia Most towns were still dominated by German merchants,Engel 2001, p. 261. but more and more Croat, Hungarian and Slovak peasants arrived from the nearby villages to settle in the towns in the 14th century.Bak 1993, p. 277. Louis I's Privilegium pro Slavis (\\"Privilege for the Slavs\\") from 1381 was the first indication of official bilingualism in a town.Kirschbaum 2005, p. 46. It ensured that the Slovaks in Zsolna (present-day ≈Ωilina, Slovakia) would enjoy the same privileges as the town's German burghers. Louis I who was heir presumptive to Casimir III of Poland assisted the Poles several times against Lithuania and the Golden Horde.Engel 2001, p. 167. The foundation of Moldavia, a Romanian principality east of the Carpathians is also connected to these campaigns.Georgescu 1991, p. 18. Along the southern frontiers, Louis I compelled the Venetians to withdraw from Dalmatia in 1358Goldstein 1999, p. 27. and forced a number of local rulers (including Tvrtko I of Bosnia, and Lazar of Serbia) to accept his suzerainty.Engel 2001, pp. 162-165. However, his vassals often rebelled against him in the 1360s.Engel 2001, p. 165. Bogdan, a Romanian voivode even achieved the independence of Moldavia. Louis I's suzerainty over Moldavia was only restored when he was elected king of Poland in 1370. His control over Wallachia, the other Romanian principality always remained doubtful.Engel 2001, pp. 165-166. Vladislav I of Wallachia even allied with the emerging Ottoman Empire in 1375. Therefore, Louis I was the first Hungarian monarch who had to fight against the Ottomans. Religious fanaticism is one of the featuring element of Louis I's reign.Engel 2001, p. 172. He attempted, without success, to convert many of his Orthodox subjects to Catholicism by force.Moln√°r 2001, p. 53. He expelled the Jews around 1360, but allowed them to return in 1367.Engel 2001, pp. 172-173. New royal castles were erected, for instance, in Visegr√°d, Di√≥sgy≈ër, and Z√≥lyom (present-day Zvolen, Slovakia) under the Angevin kings.Kontler 1999, p. 99.Engel 2001, pp. 147-148. Patricians' houses unearthed at Sopron and other towns, frescoes and sculptures found at many places (including Esztergom and Nagyv√°rad) point at a flourishing Gothic architecture and art. Codices decorated with miniatures (among them the Illuminated Chronicle) attest to the high level of book illumination.Kontler 1999, pp. 99-100. William of Bergzabern, Bishop of P√©cs founded a university at his see in 1367,Sedlar 1994, p. 472. but it was closed shortly after his death in 1375.Engel 2001, p. 194. New consolidation (1382-1437) Sigismund of Luxemburg and his queen, Barbara of Cilli at the Council of Constance Louis I was succeeded in 1382 by his daughter, Mary.Kontler 1999, p. 101. However, most noblemen opposed the idea of being ruled by a female monarch. Taking advantage of the situation, a male member of the dynasty, Charles III of Naples claimed the throne for himself.Engel 2001, p. 195. He arrived in the kingdom in September 1385. Although the Diet forced the queen to abdicate and elected Charles of Naples king, the queen's partisans murdered him in February 1386. Paul Horvat, Bishop of Zagreb initiated a new rebellion and declared his infant son, Ladislaus of Naples king.Engel 2001, p. 198. They captured the queen in July 1386, but her supporters proposed the crown to her husband, Sigismund of Luxemburg.Bak 1994, p. 54. Queen Mary was soon liberated,Fine 1994, p. 397. but she never again intervened in the government.Kontler 1999, p. 102. Sigismund distributed more than 50 percent of the royal estates to his supporters.Engel 2001, pp. 199-201. Furthermore, large territories in Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia remained controlled by Hrvoje Vukƒçiƒá Hrvatiniƒá and Ladislaus of Naples's other supporters.Fine 1994, p. 398. When Queen Mary died childless in 1395, her sister, Queen Jadwiga of Poland claimed the throne for herself, but Sigismund's partisans defeated her troops.Engel 2001, p. 201. In the meantime, Stefan Lazareviƒá of Serbia accepted the Ottoman sultan's suzerainty,Fine 1994, p. 412. thus the Ottoman Empire's expansion reached the southern frontiers of Hungary in 1390.Kontler 1999, pp. 102-103. Sigismund decided to organize a crusade against the Ottomans.Fine 1994, p. 424. A great army consisting mainly of French knights assembled, but the crusaders were routed in the battle of Nicopolis in 1396.Engel 2001, p. 203. The Diet of Temesv√°r (present-day Timi»ôoara, Romania) of 1397 obliged all landholders to finance the equipment of soldiers for defensive purposes.Kontler 1999, p. 104. Thereafter, all landholders provided one archer for each twenty peasant households on their estates.Sedlar 1994, p. 167. In the same year, Sigismund abolished former immunities of the jurisdiction of county authoritiesEngel 2001, p. 219. which accelerated the development of county assemblies into important institutions of local autonomy.Kirschbaum 2005, p. 53. Sigismund's open bias towards Stibor of Stiboricz, Hermann of Cilli and his (mostly foreign) favorites gave rise to a number of plots. Led by John Kanizsai, archbishop of Esztergom, the native barons even imprisoned him in 1401.Engel 2001, p. 206. For six months, the barons administered the realm in the name of the Holy Crown, \\"the impersonal sovereign of the kingdom\\" (Mikl√≥s Moln√°r),Moln√°r 2001, p. 56. but finally restored Sigismund's rule. A group of barons offered the crown to Ladislaus of Naples in 1412, but Sigismund again gained the upper hand.Engel 2001, p. 208. Since Pope Boniface IX supported his opponent, Sigismund prohibited both the proclamation of papal documents without a previous royal consentEngel 2001, p. 210. and the appointment of prelates by the Holy See. Sigismund's hunting castle at Tata The major towns always remained faithful to Sigismund.Kontler 1999, p. 106. He exempted many of them from internal custom duties and even invited their representatives to the Diet in 1405. However, the Diet was not convoked for three decades.Engel 2001, p. 214. The king spent more and more time abroad especially after his election King of the Romans in 1410. The kingdom was governed by his most faithful partisans who were united in a formal league, the Order of the Dragon.Moln√°r 2001, p. 57. This knightly order was established on the occasion of the royal troop's victory over Hrvoje Hrvatiniƒá in 1408.Kontler 1999, p. 105. Thereafter most Dalmatian towns seceded from Ladislaus of Naples, but he soon sold his claims to the Republic of Venice.Goldstein 1999, p. 29-30. In the following decade, the republic forced the settlements on the Dalmatian coasts one by one to accept her suzerainty.Fine 1994, pp. 489-490. first Hungarian translation of the Bible On the southern borders, Sigismund attempted to create a buffer zone against the Ottomans.Bak 1994, p. 61. For this purpose, he granted large estates to Stefan Lazareviƒá of Serbia, Mircea I of Wallachia and other neighboring rulers.Engel 2001, pp. 232-234. Furthermore, fourteen new fortresses were erected on the Danube frontier under the auspices of the Italian Pipo of Ozora.Engel 2001, p. 237. The first Gypsy groups were also admitted in the kingdom because of their information on the Ottoman Empire's military and their skills in manufacturing weapons.Crowe 2007, p. 70. The Ottomans occupied Golubac Fortress in 1427 and started to regularly plunder the neighboring lands. The Ottoman raids forced many locals to depart for better protected regions. Their place was occupied by South Slavic refugees (mainly Serbs). Many of them were organized into mobile military unitsKontler 1999, p. 111. known as hussars.Engel 2001, p. 339. The northern regions of the kingdom (present-day Slovakia) were pillaged in almost every year by Czech Hussites from 1428.Spiesz et al 2006, pp. 52-53. However, Hussite ideas spread in the southern counties, mainly among the burghers of the Szer√©ms√©g.Bak 1994, p. 60. Hussite preachers were also the first to translate the Bible to Hungarian. However, all Hussites were either executed or expelled from the Szer√©ms√©g in the late 1430s. Sigismund erected a splendid royal palace (later destroyed by the Ottomans) at Buda.Engel 2001, p. 241. Actually, the town became the kingdom's capital in his reign. The wealthiest landholders also constructed new residences or rebuilt their old fortresses in order to improve comfort. For instance, Pipo of Ozora who employed the painter Masolino da Panicale and one of Brunelleschi's students introduced Renaissance architecture and arts.Kontler 1999, p. 126. The kingdom's defense and Sigismund's active foreign policy demanded new sources of income.Kontler 1999, p. 109. For instance, the king imposed \\"extraordinary\\" taxes on the prelates and mortgaged 13 Saxon towns in the Szepess√©g to Poland in 1412.Engel 2001, pp. 227-228. He regularly debased coinage which resulted in a major rebellion of Hungarian and Romanian peasants in Transylvania in 1437.Georgescu 1991, p. 30. It was suppressed by the joint forces of the Hungarian noblemen, Sz√©kelys and Transylvanian Saxons who concluded an agreement against the rebels.Georgescu 1991, pp. 31., 41. Age of the two Hunyadis (1437-1490) Hunyadi Castle at Vajdahunyad (present-day Hunedoara, Romania) Sigismund, who had no sons, died in late 1437.Bak 1994, p. 62. The Estates elected his son-in-law, Albert V of Austria, king.Engel 2001, p. 279. Albert promised not to make any decisions without consulting the prelates and the lords. He died of dysentery during an unsuccessful military operation against the Ottomans in 1439.Kontler 1999, p. 112. Although Albert's widow, Elizabeth of Luxembourg, gave birth to a posthumous son, Ladislaus V,Engel 2001, pp. 279-280. most noblemen preferred a monarch capable to fight.Bak 1994, p. 63. They offered the crown to W≈Çadys≈Çaw III of Poland. Both Ladislaus and W≈Çadys≈Çaw were crowned which caused a civil war.Engel 2001, pp. 282-283. John Hunyadi, a talented military leader who supported W≈Çadys≈Çaw, rose to prominence during these fights. W≈Çadys≈Çaw appointed Hunyadi (together with his close friend, Nicholas √öjlaki) to command the southern defenses in 1441. Hunyadi made several raids against the Ottomans.Engel 2001, pp. 284-285. During his \\"long campaign\\" of 1443-1444, the Hungarian forces penetrated as far as Sofia within the Ottoman Empire.Kontler 1999, p. 114. The Holy See organized a new crusade, but the Ottomans annihilated the Christian forces at the Battle of Varna in 1444, during which W≈Çadys≈Çaw was killed.Engel 2001, pp. 286-287. John Hunyadi's tomb in the St Michael's Cathedral in Gyulafeh√©rv√°r (present-day Alba Iulia, Romania) Matthias the Just at around 50 years old (contemporary sculpture from Buda Castle) Following W≈Çadys≈Çaw's death, the Diet of 1445 acknowledged the infant Ladislaus V as rightful monarch.Kontler 1999, p. 116. He lived in the court of his relative, Frederick III.Engel 2001, p. 288. Therefore, the Estates appointed seven \\"captains\\", one of them being Hunyadi, to govern the kingdom.Bak 1994, p. 67. The Diet of 1446 elected Hunyadi sole regent, but it was also stipulated that he should convoke the Diet annually. At the Diets, all official documents were issued and even speeches could be made in Latin. However, the German-speaking delegates from Pressburg (present-day Bratislava, Slovakia) reported already in 1446 that they could not understand the debates because the noblemen spoke in Hungarian. Large territories remained independent of the central government in Hunyadi's regency.Engel 2001, p. 289. For instance, Frederick III held several towns along the western borders, and a Czech mercenary, John Jiskra of Brand√Ωs, administered many fortresses in the northern regions.Spiesz et al 2006, p. 54. Even so, Hunyadi was planning to fight against the Ottomans in their own territories.Engel 2001, p. 291. However, his new campaign ended with the Christian forces' defeat at Kosovo in 1448. Ladislaus V's Austrian and Bohemian subjects forced Emperor Frederick III to hand their young monarch over to his new guardian, Ulrich II, Count of Celje in 1452.Engel 2001, p. 292. Hunyadi also resigned from the regency, but he continued to administer a significant part of royal revenues and many royal fortresses.Kontler 1999, p. 117. According to a contemporary proposal for the reform of royal revenues, more than 50 percent thereof (around 120,000 florins) derived from the royal monopoly on salt and a direct tax payable by the peasantry.Bak 1994, p. 68. The Fall of Constantinople in 1453 demonstrated the beginning of a new phase of Ottoman expansion under Sultan Mehmed II.Engel 2001, p. 295. In two years, he occupied Serbia and decided to take Belgrade (), the key fort at Hungary's southern frontier.Fine 1991, pp. 568-569.Sedlar 1994, p. 251. The defence was organized by John Hunyadi, who was assisted by the Franciscan preacher, John of Capistrano.Engel 2001, p. 296. They mobilized 25-30,000 commoners, cut the Ottomans' supply lines and forced them to withdraw on July 22, 1456.Bak 1994, p. 69. Hunyadi died in an epidemic in two weeks. Ulrich of Celje ordered Hunyadi's elder son, Ladislaus, to hand over all royal castles held by his father.Kontler 1999, p. 118. Ladislaus Hunyadi pretended to accept the command, but his retinue murdered Ulrich in Belgrade.Bak 1994, p. 70. He was arrested in March 1457, along with his younger brother Matthias, and subsequently executed. However, the execution stirred up the lesser nobility to revolt. Ladislaus V fled to Prague, where he died before the end of the year. A Diet was convoked and the assembled noblemen elected Matthias Hunyadi king in 1458.Engel 2001, p. 298. The young monarch in short time removed the powerful Ladislaus Garay from the office of palatine and his uncle, Michael Szil√°gyi, of the regency.Engel 2001, p. 299. Led by Garay, his opponents offered the crown to Frederick III, but Matthias defeated them and concluded a peace treaty with the emperor in 1464. In the meantime, the zone of buffer states along the kingdom's southern frontiers collapsed with the occupation of Serbia and Bosnia by the Ottomans.Engel 2001, pp. 300-301. As an immediate consequence, a great number of Serbian refugees settled in the kingdom.Fine 1994, p. 576. King Matthias introduced far- reaching fiscal and military reforms.Kontler 1999, p. 121. First of all, peasants were in each year obliged to pay a lump-sum \\"extraordinary tax\\",Engel 2001, pp. 310-311. often without the consent of the Diet.Kontler 1999, p. 120. Traditional taxes were renamed in order to abolish earlier exemptions (for instance, the \\"thirtieth\\" was collected under the name \\"duty of the Crown\\" from 1467).Bak 1994, p. 71. Contemporary estimations suggest that his total yearly income was about 650,000 golden florins.Engel 2001, p. 311. More than 60 percent of his revenues (about 400,000 florins) derived from the \\"extraordinary tax\\", but salt monopoly and coinage still yielded significant income (60-80,000 florins). Campaigns of the \\"Black Army of Hungary\\" Increased royal revenues enabled Matthias to set up and maintain a standing army.Sedlar 1994, pp. 225., 238 Consisting of mainly Czech, German and Hungarian mercenaries, his \\"Black Army\\" was one of the first professional military forces in Europe.Engel 2001, p. 309. Matthias strengthened the network of fortresses along the southern frontier,Engel 2001, pp. 308-309. but he did not pursue his father's offensive anti-Ottoman policy.Kontler 1999, p. 125. Instead, he launched attacks on Bohemia, Poland, and Austria, arguing that he was trying to forge an alliance strong enough to expel the Ottomans from Europe.Kontler 1999, pp. 123-125. Although his war against the \\"heretic\\" king of Bohemia, George of Podƒõbrady, was supported by the Holy See,Engel 2001, pp. 303-304. this reorientation of the kingdom's foreign policy was unpopular.Bak 1994, p. 72. Led by John Vit√©z, archbishop of Esztergom, many of Matthias's former supporters rebelled against him in 1471. They offered the throne to Casimir, son of Casimir IV of Poland, but Matthias overcame them without difficulties. His war against Bohemia ended with the Peace of Olomouc of 1478 which confirmed his hold of Moravia, Silesia and Lusatia.Bak 1994, pp. 72-73. In the next decade, Matthias waged a war against Emperor Frederick III which enabled him to occupy Styria and Lower Austria (including Vienna).Bak 1994, p. 73. Matthias rarely convoked a Diet and governed by royal decrees after 1471.Sedlar 1994, p. 290. He preferred to employ lesser nobles and even commoners instead of aristocrats in state administration. His Decretum Maius of 1486 strengthened the authority of county magistrates by abolishing the palatine's right to convoke judicial assemblies in the counties and by annulling earlier immunities.Engel 2001, p. 316.Bak 1994, p. 74. King \\"Matthias the Just\\" travelling in disguise throughout his realm in order to suppress corruption became a hero of popular folk tales for some years after his death. Matthias's court was \\"unquestionably among the most brilliant in Europe\\" (Mikl√≥s Moln√°r).Moln√°r 2001, p. 79. His library, the Bibliotheca Corviniana with its 2,000 manuscripts, was the second greatest in size among contemporary book-collections.Engel 2001, p. 319. Matthias was the first monarch north of the Alps to introduce Italian Renaissance style in his realms. Inspired by his second wife, Beatrice of Naples, he had the royal palaces at Buda and Visegr√°d rebuilt under the auspices of Italian architects and artists after 1479. Decline (1490-1526) Matthias' reforms did not survive the turbulent decades that followed his death in 1490. An oligarchy of quarrelsome magnates gained control of Hungary. Not wanting another heavy- handed king, they procured the accession of Vladislaus II, the king of Bohemia and son of Casimir IV of Poland, precisely because of his notorious weakness: he was known as King Dob≈æe, or Dobzse (meaning \\"all right\\"), from his habit of accepting, without question, every petition and document laid before him. Vladislaus II donated most of the royal estates, r√©gales and royalties to the nobility. By this method, the king tried to stabilize his new reign and preserve his popularity amongst the magnates. After the na√Øve fiscal and land policy of the royal court, the central power began to experience severe financial difficulties, largely due to the enlargement of feudal lands at his expense. The noble estate of the parliament succeeded in reducing the tax burden by 70-80 percent, at the expense of the country's ability to defend itself.Francis Fukuyama: Origins of Political Order: From Pre-Human Times to the French Revolution Vladislaus II also abolished the taxes that had supported Matthias' mercenary army. As a result, the king's army dispersed just as the Turks were threatening Hungary. The magnates also dismantled Mathias' administration and antagonized the lesser nobles. In 1492 the Diet limited the serfs' freedom of movement and expanded their obligations while a large portion of peasants became prosperous because of cattle-export to the West. Rural discontent boiled over in 1514 when well-armed peasants preparing for a crusade against Turks rose up under Gy√∂rgy D√≥zsa, a borderguard captain, and attacked estates across Hungary. United by a common threat, the magnates and lesser nobles eventually crushed the rebels. D√≥zsa and other rebel leaders were brutally executed. Shocked by the peasant revolt, the Diet of 1514 passed laws that condemned the serfs to eternal bondage and increased their work obligations. Corporal punishment became widespread, and one noble even branded his serfs like livestock. The legal scholar Istv√°n Werb≈ëczy included the new laws in his Tripartitum of 1514, which made up the espirit of Hungary's legal corpus until the revolution of 1848. However, the Tripartitum was never used as a code. The Tripartitum gave Hungary's king and nobles, or magnates, equal shares of power: the nobles recognized the king as superior, but in turn the nobles had the power to elect the king. The Tripartitum also freed the nobles from taxation, obligated them to serve in the military only in a defensive war, and made them immune from arbitrary arrest. When Vladislaus II died in 1516, his ten-year-old son Louis II became king, but a royal council appointed by the Diet ruled the country. Hungary was in a state of near anarchy under the magnates' rule. The king's finances were a shambles; he borrowed to meet his household expenses despite the fact that they totaled about one-third of the national income. The country's defenses sagged as border guards went unpaid, fortresses fell into disrepair, and initiatives to increase taxes to reinforce defenses were stifled. In 1521 Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent recognized Hungary's weakness and seized Belgrade in preparation for an attack on Hungary. Battle of Moh√°cs (1526) Following the fall of Belgrade, Louis II and his wife, Mary of Habsburg, tried to manage an anti-magnate putsch, but were not successful. In August 1526, the Ottomans under Suleiman appeared in southern Hungary, and he marched nearly 100,000 Turkish-Islamic troops into Hungary's heartland. The Hungarian army, numbering around 26,000, met the Turks at Moh√°cs. Though the Hungarian troops were well-equipped and well-trained, they lacked a good military leader, while reinforcements from Croatia and Transylvania did not arrive in time. They were utterly defeated, with up to 20,000 killed on the field, while Louis himself died when he fell from his horse into a bog. Partitioning (1526-1541) After Louis's death, the rival factions of Hungarian nobles simultaneously elected two kings, John Z√°polya and Ferdinand of Habsburg. Each claimed sovereignty over the entire country but lacked sufficient forces to eliminate his rival. Z√°polya, a Hungarian who was military governor of Transylvania, was recognized by Sultan Suleiman and was supported mostly by lesser nobles opposed to new foreign kings. Z√°polya's realm also became an Ottoman vassal in 1529 when he swore fealty to Suleiman. Ferdinand drew support from magnates in western Hungary who hoped he could convince his brother, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, to expel the Turks. In 1538 George Martinuzzi, Z√°polya's adviser, arranged an agreement between the rivals, known as the Treaty of Nagyv√°rad,Istv√°n Keul, Early modern religious communities in East-Central Europe: ethnic diversity, denominational plurality, and corporative politics in the principality of Transylvania (1526‚Äì1691), BRILL, 2009, p. 40 that would have made Ferdinand sole monarch upon the death of the then-childless Z√°polya. The agreement failed when, just before his death in 1540, Z√°polya married and fathered a son, John Sigismund Z√°polya. Violence erupted, and the Turks seized the opportunity, conquering the city of Buda and then partitioning the country in 1541.

Along with Khakra, Fafda, Dhokla, and Khandvi (among others), they are among the most popular snacks originating from the Indian State of Gujarat. They are a popular teatime snack not only in Gujarat but across India and also among NRIs across the world. They are soft and not crunchy like most other Indian snacks. A sweeter version is called Mitha Ganthiya. Ganthiya are so popular in the Indian state of Gujarat that some people feed them even to the migratory birds that come each year to Nal Sarovar, Gujarat's biggest and one of the India's biggest bird sanctuary. Wildlife Experts say this can be dangerous for the birds since Gathiya is not a natural food for any birds and they can potentially have negative effects on health of the birds who consume them.

On 29 October 1354, Roberto Visconti was appointed archbishop of Milan. On 5 January 1355, he crowned Emperor Charles IV in St. Ambrose Basilica with the Iron Crown of Lombardy, although other sources claim that Patriarch of Aquileia or the Bishop of Bergamo crowned the Emperor, since Roberto was not consecrated until April 1355. On 5 December 1355, Roberto Visconti laid the foundation stone of the foundation of the Church of San Giovanni that restored the Basilica di Santa Tecla. The political power of his Visconti cousins, who ruled the Milan, complicated Roberto's life. Usually, there were only minor conflicts, but in 1360, Pope Innocent VI excommunicated Bernab√≤ Visconti. The latter reputedly uttered the following Latin phrase against the Archbishop of Milan one day when he had refused to carry out Bernab√≤'s orders, due to the excommunication: Roberto Visconti died on 8 August 1361 in Milan, but according to other sources would have died in his castle in Legnano.

He was taken to the first team in 2000, but in a period of three seasons only made 1 appearance for the club. In 2003 Gospodars moved to the Russian First Division club Lada Togliatti.

In 2005 Gospodars joined the newly founded Latvian Higher League club FK Venta. After the half of the season the club suffered a financial crisis, the first team players were let go and the season was finished in the last 8th position of the league table, playing with the youth squad. Afterwards, the club was dissolved and Gospodars moved to the Armenian Premier League club FC Mika at the start of 2006. He played a few matches in the first team but was mostly used in the reserves.

Description The fountain stands near the bridge adjacent to the castle, in the part that connects the old town with the new part of town. This fountain is famous, because for a long time it was thought to constitute the oldest fountain in Italy. Originally, it was thought that the fountain dated back to the third century BC, but after long studies the architectural work has been adapted, considering the right place of its creation was during the Renaissance. However, not all are of the same opinion and the exact dating still remains a mystery. Originally the fountain stood in the spa area, which is currently called \\"fontanelle\\", but in 1548 it was transported near the ancient Church of St. Nicholas, no longer visible. Subsequently, in 1560, the fountain was again dismantled and rebuilt in its present location. Its fa√ßade is divided into three blocks of four caryatids that support the architrave with a rich decor. Everything reaches a height of approximately five meters. In the three compartments formed between the four caryatids, bas-reliefs enrich the work. These bas-reliefs depicting the mythological metamorphosis of Dirce, Salmacis, and Byblis. On top of the fa√ßade, built in a later period and probably dating from 1765, were placed the arms of the city of Gallipoli, an inscription in Latin and the insignia of King Charles III of Spain.

Guitarist Eugene Chadbourne, writing for Allmusic.com, said of Cinderella, \\"He was a technically brilliant, original player who for long periods let his creative talents become obscured not by piles of soot and ash but by their musical equivalent, commercial studio jobs.\\" Career Joe Cinderella was born into an Italian family in Newark, New Jersey, in 1927. He played mandolin, imitating his father, before picking up guitar when he was nine years old. He admired the music of Charlie Christian and Eddie Lang, and he copied the licks of Django Reinhardt. He was drafted at the age of eighteen and lived at Camp Lee in Virginia. A staff sergeant who was a fan of jazz guitar heard him playing. The sergeant gave him his own room, where he played guitar all day, and prevented him from being sent to Germany by putting him in a general's band as a drummer. He married Angela Cipulla and lived in Paterson while working as a musician in New York City. In 1954, they had a daughter, Daria, who also studied music. In the 1950s, Cinderella recorded extensively with saxophonist Gil Mell√©, and he accompanied vocalist Chris Connor with double bassist Vinnie Burke. He worked as a session guitarist for much of the 1960s, appearing on music for radio, television, and film. As a studio musician Cinderella performed with the Beach Boys, Billy Joel, and classical composer John Cage. He taught guitar in a New Jersey college from 1969 and wrote several instructional books for jazz guitar. He self-released the album Concept in 2002. At William Paterson College he became a member of the adjunct faculty and helped establish the school's jazz guitar program.

The founding meeting was held in the Saarbr√ºcken Workers Welfare House in on March 27, 1933. Jakob Frank was elected as the leader of the organization.

K√∂ln: Bund-Verlag, 1986. pp. 101-102. . Through the choice of name the organization manifested that the ideological compromise of the Reichsbanner had ended. Leadership Frank had gained experience as an organizer in Reichsbanner and the Iron Front. However, in the background the party chairman Max Braun acted as the de facto leader of the organization. Braun would inspire many SSB youth activists fighting against a National Socialist take-over in the Saar territory.Mallmann, Klaus-Michael, Gerhard Paul, and Hans-Walter Herrmann. Widerstand und Verweigerung im Saarland 1935-1945]. [Bd 1]. Bonn: Dietz Nachfolger, 1995. p. 72. . Heinz K√ºhn (who later became the Minister-President of North Rhine-Westphalia) was the leader of the youth formation of SSB. Organization The set-up of the organization followed that of Reichsbanner and the Austrian Republikanischer Schutzbund. SSB had its headquarters in Sulzbach. There are no definitive records of the size of the organization. According to one account it counted some 200-300 men in its ranks. SSB sought to circumvent the ban on uniforms imposed by the Government Commission, and its members wore green shirt, black pants and boots at public appearances. SSB possessed some light handguns and some ammunition, but lacked regular weaponry. Activities SSB acted as security forces at mass meetings, and during election campaigns smaller teams of SSB fighters confronted the National Socialist groups. SSB activists also acted as body guards for Max Braun, who faced death threats at the time. Aftermath A number of the Saar German fighters in the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War were former SSB members.

Built in 1934-35 after a devastating fire destroyed the old city hall and part of the business district, it is a municipal building with Georgian Revival features unusual for Maine. The building was designed by Philadelphia architect Edmund Gilchrist, and is reflective of that area. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history Ellsworth City Hall stands on a hill north of United States Route 1, overlooking the city's central business district, separated from it by a parking lot. It is a two-story brick building, with a horizontal gable-roofed main block, which is flanked by hip-roofed perpendicular wings, and which has a center projecting gable-roof entry section. The flanking wings are joined to the main block by flat-roofed sections. The gable of the projecting center section is filled with carved painted woodwork, including a rendition of the city's seal. At the center of the main block an octagonal cupola rises to a round roof with spire. The Ellsworth downtown area was devastated by a fire on May 7, 1933, whose casualties included the old city hall. The disastrous fire made it necessary to plan a complete new layout for the Civic Center. This plan included a new City Hall with Fire Station in one end of the basement; also a large parking space where an unsightly back area of stores existed. The estimated cost, which included the removal of about 12,000 cubic yards of dirt, was prohibitive at that time. This developed into an excellent project for manual labor when the Federal Civil Works Administration (CWA) was initiated in November, 1933. Work was carried on throughout the winter by the CWA and Maine Emergency Relief Administration (MERA). They completed the job in the fall of 1935. Work was given to an average of 65 men over an eight month period. An interesting feature of this work was that dirt removed was used on the High School Athletic Field nearby. The City Hall was completed under a Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) loan.Maine Emergency Relief Administration, Work Progress Activities May 1, 1934 - July 1 1935 by Hildreth Hawes Edmund Gilchrist, a Philadelphia architect who summered on nearby Mount Desert Island, was chosen to design the new building, in which particular attention was paid to the use of fireproof materials. Gilchrist also made recommendations, ultimately not carried out, for a larger-scale redesign of the downtown area in the aftermath of the fire. The building's design features are more reflective of Gilchrist's experience with historic Georgian structures in Philadelphia than they are of rural Maine.

He is also known for his work in contemporary and classical choreography.  Life and career  Darren Anderson was born to Gerald Hubert Anderson, a Master Warrant Officer from the Royal Canadian Armed Forces, and Jean Elizabeth Anderson, a gemologist, in Edmonton, Alberta. While growing up, Anderson describes his early exposure as being to hockey, which his family encouraged him to pursue, to follow in the steps of his uncle Norm Ullman, a hockey star who had been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. But Anderson was not interested in hockey; instead he began studying ballet at age 18 at the Alberta Ballet School, and he described himself as immediately \\"hooked\\". At age 19, Anderson was accepted into the National Ballet of Canada and the Royal Winnipeg Ballet summer programs and was given a scholarship to attend the Royal Winnipeg Ballet, where he won a spot in the school's professional division. He completed the program in 1998 and danced with the company as an Aspirant for one season while continuing his training through private coaching with Dr. Arnold Spohr. In 1999 he joined the Cincinnati Ballet, where he remained for three seasons. He also studied at the American Ballet Theatre's Summer Intensive in New York City. Anderson returned Canada to join the Royal Winnipeg Ballet in 2002, where he was Second Soloist with the company, and performed such roles as Uncle Drosselmeyer in \\"The Nutcracker\\", the cat in \\"Puss in Boots\\", and the dog in \\"Val Caniparoli's Cinderella\\". In the latter production, he played Carabosse, the wicked witch role that required him to dress in drag. He had a dominant stage presence infused with his theatrical and comedic abilities, which commanded attention. Another significant part for him was as Cinderella's dog in \\"A Cinderella Story\\", which gave him the reputation of being adept at portraying characters such as mystical and animal roles. It also identified his talent for injecting his roles with a compelling edge that, beyond just the dancing itself, delighted audiences. \\"It was Darren Anderson, en travestie as the wicked Carabosse, who almost stole the show.\\" Anderson was also known for his physicality, which proved pivotal in his roles, and his finesse in transitioning from classical works to contemporary works within a single season. \\"An exception to the company's general constraint in attack was Darren Anderson's Puss in Boots. Though also coulourlessly costumed, he danced with abandon within his character.\\" He gained wide respect for community outreach to increase interest in ballet across generations and to expose children to dance at an early age. Anderson's advanced ballet training, which was exclusively classical, included the Russian Vaganova method, the English Royal Academy of Dance, and the George Balanchine method. He danced with Banff Festival Ballet (Summer company), Royal Winnipeg Ballet, Cincinnati Ballet, Smuin Ballet, and danced in guest performances in Canada, the United States, Japan, and Europe. His principal dance teachers were: Arnold Spohr, Ross Brierton, Arlene Minkhorst, and Willie Burman. Over his career, Anderson danced in a wide variety of works by such noted choreographers as George Balanchine, Agnes De Mille, Rudi van Dantzig, Jiri Kylian, John Neumeier, John Cranko, Val Caniparoli, Michael Smuin, Stanton Welch and Itzik Galili. He was most identified in the following roles: \\"Dog\\" in Val Caniparoli's \\"A Cinderella Story\\", \\"Carabosse\\" in The Sleeping Beauty, soloist in Stanton Welch's \\"Fingerprints\\", Petite Mort (Kylian), \\"Sugar Plum Cavalier\\", Uncle Drosselmeyer in \\"The Nutcracker\\", \\"Snow Cavalier\\", \\"Spanish\\", and \\"Rat King\\", in \\"The Nutcracker\\", \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" balcony scene, \\"Dr. Van Helsing\\" in Dracula, \\"Le Jazz Hot\\" pas de deux, \\"SYNC\\" (Nils Christie). In August, 2008, Anderson joined Smuin Ballet, a company founded by Emmy and Tony Award winning choreographer Michael Smuin, who had previously served as the co-Director of the San Francisco Ballet. In Anderson's five-year dance tenure with the company, he performed solos in such works as Petite Mort, \\"French Twist\\", \\"Dancin' with Gershwin\\", \\"Dances With Songs\\", and \\"Fly Me to the Moon\\". He performed his final program with Smuin in May 2012, which included Val Caniparoli's \\"Swipe,\\" Ma Cong's \\"Through\\" and Michael Smuin's \\"Symphony of Psalms\\". In 2012, Anderson began work on new choreography for Smuin Ballet. His choreography, entitled \\"All I want for Christmas is You,\\" for the Smuin annual holiday show, received accolades from the media. His choreographed works, \\"At Last\\" and \\"Kiss-Kiss\\" were highlighted in Smuin Ballet's annual gala evenings in 2015 and 2016, respectively. He was appointed to the newly created Community Relations Manager position for the company, where one of his focuses is community outreach and public relations. Anderson received accolades for his establishment of an LGBT Night event at Smuin Ballet. In 2018, Darren Anderson launched a K-12 education initiative called \\"Dancentive\\" aimed at incorporating dance as part fitness and health for children.

It is situated about west of Warmun and north of Halls Creek in the Kimberley region. Both the station and nearby Mount Bedford were named in 1903 after Admiral Frederick Bedford, who was the Governor of Western Australia. Established some time prior to 1906 by the Buchanan and Gordon Brothers, the property experienced many difficulties including the spearing of cattle and isolation of the area. In two years nearly a dozen men had also been murdered by the traditional owners. The family business, Quilty and sons, acquired the property in 1917 from Messrs. Mather, Ross, Manning and Ralston for ¬£34,000. The property was stocked with 8,500 head of cattle and 80 horses. Patrick Quilty was left to manage Bedford Downs while his brother Tom Quilty managed Euroka Springs in the Northern Territory. A boundary rider named Harry Annear was murdered by Aboriginal people on the property near the Durack River in 1921. The Aboriginal artist, Paddy Bedford, was born at the property around 1922. His surname is taken from the station and the station's owner Paddy Quilty was the source of his given name.Tony Stephens, '\\"Millionaire\\" believer in \\"two-way\\"', (Obituary), Sydney Morning Herald, 20 July 2007, p. 18. In 1924 a massacre of Gija and Worla men occurred on the station after the men were tried for spearing a milking cow. They were fed food laced with strychnine by white station hands and then shot or clubbed to death. The bodies were subsequently burned by the local police.Nevill Drury, Anna Voigt, Fire and shadow: spirituality in contemporary Australian art,Craftsman House, 1996 p.84 The series of paintings by Indigenous Australian artist Rover Thomas called Bedford Downs Killings depicts these events. Following the death of Patrick Quilty in 1938, the family retained possession of Bedford Downs and also acquired neighbouring Springvale Station from W. J. McAdam in 1948. Sterling Buntine acquired the property in the early 2000s then sold it in 2011 to the Paraway Pastoral Company which is owned by the Macquarie Bank.

Frederik van den Bergh defended Lingen for Philip II of Spain which was besieged from 25 October 1597. After a siege of more than two weeks, Van den Bergh surrendered on 12 November 1597. The siege was part of Maurice's successful 1597 campaign against the Spaniards. Background Maurice had already achieved many successes in the year of 1597 which started off with the victory at Turnhout. Afterwards he started a campaign in the summer through the east of the Netherlands and took important fortified strongholds which included Oldenzaal and Groenlo from the Spanish. His campaign was coming to a successful conclusion and only Lingen was still in Spanish hands. By the end of October 1597 Maurice and his army arrived at Lingen and by taking the city the Spanish would have no choice but to abandon the region of Twente as a whole. The town was situated at the extreme boundary of the Low Countries (in present-day Germany), governed by Frederik van den Bergh which was defended by 500 men under Lieutenant Verdugo .Israel pg 29-30 (French) Maurice's army which included English and Scots under Horace Vere had left the recently captured Oldenzaal and had to cross the Ems river which they achieved without incident.Knight, Charles Raleigh: Historical records of The Buffs, East Kent Regiment (3rd Foot) formerly designated the Holland Regiment and Prince George of Denmark's Regiment. Vol I.

This caused several days of delay but once the big guns were in use they would be able to shell the fortifications and city.Wagenaar pg 474-75 Siege and aftermath As the siege started the garrison made a brisk sortie and burnt a mill but they were driven back by the English and Scots who were at the head of the attack. It took a lot of effort to get the big guns dug in by the canal under fire, so that the city would be besieged proper. They were soon put in use however and the towns fortified walls were pounded. With the situation now desperate Van den Bergh was hoping for news of a relieving army but the only news he was to receive from the Cardinal Archduke Albert was to save the city. Thus with no hope of relief Van den Burgh surrendered Lingen to Maurice on 12 November. By capturing Lingen, Maurice closed off the campaign of 1597 and was just one of his latest conquests during this successful period, called the Ten Glory Years. The Spanish abandoned Twente as had been expected and military activity ended for the year. Maurice had taken nine strongly fortified cities and five castles, opened the navigation of the Rhine, and strengthened the whole eastern bulwarks of the Republic. Lingen would be recaptured eight years later by Ambrosio Spinola in his campaign of 1605.

Although the film uses the abbreviation \\"R.U.R\\" for the robots, it is not based directly on the 1920 stageplay by Karel ƒåapek. The film is based on the Ukrainian novel \\"Iron Riot\\" (also known as \\"Robots are coming\\") by Volodimir Vladko. As of 2013, the film is in public domain. Plot The film's plot is centered on an engineer Jim Ripple who invents universal robots to help workers, being himself from a workers' family. He theorizes that cheap production will make all goods so cheap that Capitalism will fall. The workers do not share his view and his family considers him a traitor. A key element of his invention is a high-capacity capacitor that powers the robots. The government becomes interested in the invention because the robots can be used as a weapon as well. Ripple is given a top secret factory and funding so that he can produce robots. The robots are not autonomous or intelligent, and controlled either by radio or by sound, for which purpose Ripple uses a saxophone. When drunk he even makes the robots dance. At a day of a universal workers' strike, the administration of a factory where the Ripple's brother works, located in the same town where the robot producing plant is located, replaces workers with robots. A workers' delegation visits the factory to see that there are no strike breakers, and finds that actually it is the robots who works. The meeting ends with an accident when Ripple tries to show the abilities of a robot to the workers, so that one of the workers dies. This sparks a conflict between workers and the plant administration assisted with the military. The military decides to use robots against the workers as a weapon.

History of the Thirtieth Regiment Ohio Volunteer Infantry, From Its Organization to the Fall of Vicksburg, Miss. (\\"Enlisted Men Wounded in Action\\"). Columbus, Ohio: James W. Osgood, Printer, 1863, p. 5. Armed and equipped over the next two days, Pvt. Brown and his fellow 30th Ohio Infantrymen were then ordered into the field. Departing from Columbus aboard passenger cars via the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, they arrived in Benwood, Virginia, where they transferred to a freight train for further transport to Clarksburg. Arriving on September 2, they immediately began preparations to join the Union Army troops which were under the command of Brigadier-General William Rosecrans. Marching for Weston during the evening, they were ordered to make camp around midnight. The next morning, they resumed their march and, upon reaching Weston, made camp near the 47th Ohio Infantry. Marching again on September 5, they connected with Rosecrans' army near Sutton.Brinkerhoff, History of the Thirtieth Regiment Ohio Volunteer Infantry, pp. 7‚Äì8. Although part of the 30th Ohio was ordered onward to Little Birch Mountain and Summersville to guard the wagon train accompanying Rosecrans' forces, Pvt. Brown and his fellow members of G Company were directed to remain behind with the men from Companies D, F and I. Consequently, when part of the 30th Ohio engaged in fighting with Confederate troops at Carnifex Ferry on September 10, the men of G Company (including Brown) were not involved. Having remained behind near Sutton, the men from Companies D, F, G, and I were sent out periodically on a series of scouting and skirmish parties. During one of these forays, men from Companies G and I encountered and engaged with Confederate troops near Crites Mountain on November 13 and 14. Having successfully pushed Confederate troops out of what is, today, West Virginia, Rosecrans ordered his army into winter quarters in late November 1861. Various men were then sent out as part of detachments to track down bushwackers, assist families loyal to the Union, and serve on picket duties throughout the month of December. Following their participation in a dress parade on Christmas Day, 30th Ohioans then celebrated the holiday with food and entertainment.Brinkerhoff, History of the Thirtieth Regiment Ohio Volunteer Infantry, pp. 8‚Äì18. 1862 to early 1863 Assigned to occupation duties at Fayetteville during the winter and early spring of 1862, the 30th Ohio marched in April for Raleigh and then Princeton, where they remained until early May. Heading for Giles Court House May 10, they ultimately made camp near the East River. While there, food supplies began to run short, and men were rationed to one piece of hardtack per day with supplements of rice and beans until those supplies also ran out. Ordered to march back to Princeton the next day, many men left their warmer clothing, blankets and tents behind in order to lighten their loads ‚Äì a mistake they would soon come to regret. Marching for Raleigh early the next morning, they were ordered to make camp at the top of the Great Flat Top Mountain on May 19. While there, they battled the cold and rain until they were able to erect sturdy shelters. After finally being re-equipped with tents and other supplies, they were then ordered to move to a site near Camp Bark, where they established a more comfortable headquarters, complete with a bakery and shower. Remaining at \\"Camp Jones\\" through mid-August, Pvt. Brown and his fellow 30th Ohioans drilled regularly with bayonets.Brinkerhoff, History of the Thirtieth Regiment Ohio Volunteer Infantry, pp. 20‚Äì29. Marching August 19 for Brownstown, 95 miles away, the regiment made, broke and re-made camp at several points along the way, including at McCoys and just outside of Fayetteville and Cannelton. Boarding a steamer at Brownstown, they next found themselves at Blannerhasset Island in Ohio before being permitted to enter Parkersburg for rest and refreshment.Brinkerhoff, History of the Thirtieth Regiment Ohio Volunteer Infantry, pp. 29‚Äì31. Ordered back to eastern Virginia before month's end, the regiment departed once again by rail. Passing through Washington, D.C. and Alexandria, Virginia on August 23, the 30th Ohioans encamped in Warrenton, were assigned to picket duty at Catlett's Station and Bristoe Station, and helped to repel the enemy near Centerville and Fairfax Court House before joining the Union Army's Kanawha Division in early September. Commanded by General Marcus Reno, the Kanawha was part of the massive Union force led by General Ambrose Burnside. Marching for Georgetown in the District of Columbia on September 6, the 30th Ohio was positioned to defend Washington, D.C. from advancing Confederate forces before marching on toward New Market and Frederick City, where they were moved into the line of battle, and helped to drive off the enemy in order to retake the city.Brinkerhoff, History of the Thirtieth Regiment Ohio Volunteer Infantry, pp. 31‚Äì40. Battle of Antietam, September 17, 1862 (Missouri History Museum, c. 1861‚Äì1865). Battered by artillery at Lamb's Field and Farmer's Gap on its advance toward the Antietam as part of the Kanawha Division during the early weeks of September, the regiment lost several of its men as it engaged with the enemy. During the morning of September 17, the 30th Ohioans were among those placed near the head of the advance as the Union Army engaged in the Battle of Antietam. According to Brinkerhoff, \\"the balls flew like hail through the corn and many a brave soldier fell,\\" including the regiment's two color-bearers, who had become the rallying point for the 30th Ohio during the confusing carnage on the smoke-obscured battlefield that day. \\"The National Color was torn in fourteen places by enemy's balls, and the Regimental color, though not so often struck, still [bore] the marks of this bloody field\\" in 1863 when Brinkerhoff set pen to paper to chronicle the regiment's early days. \\"Shortly after retiring before the superior force of Hill's Division, a heavy column of [the 30th Ohio] marched down from the right and drove the enemy back to the road. On the morning of the eighteenth, \\"our entire line, from right to left, occupied the ground held by the enemy on the preceding morning, and held possession of his strongest position.\\" At noon the regiment was ordered back to the site where it had camped two days earlier. On September 19, they gathered and buried their dead. The men of the 30th Ohio were among those reviewed by President Abraham Lincoln and General George B. McClellan several weeks later. During the opening weeks of October, they continued to pursue the enemy, moving back and for across Virginia as they did so. Following a reorganization of their Division (the Kanawha) in early November, the 30th Ohio was ordered into winter quarters, and made camp near Cannelton mid-month. Ordered to march for Brownstown November 30, the regiment reached there the next day, and re-encamped near Len's Creek.Brinkerhoff, History of the Thirtieth Regiment Ohio Volunteer Infantry, pp. 41‚Äì51. Throughout early December, the regiment moved repeatedly, crossing and re-crossing creeks, flat ground and higher mountains en route to the Logan Court House during the daytime, and bedding down for the night in deserted homes which dotted the countryside, all the while searching for Confederate troops. After capturing 19 of the enemy and 75 horses, the 30th Ohioans turned over the enemy men to Union authorities at Brownstown. Briefly re-encamped from December 9‚Äì13, the regiment moved on in pursuit of the enemy. Boarding the flagship of the Union troops commanded by General Charles Ewing, the regiment sailed from Brownstown, and disembarked on January 3, 1863 at Louisville, Kentucky, where it made came near the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. Boarding the Silver Moon on January 9, Pvt. Brown and his fellow 30th Ohioans sailed again ‚Äî this time, headed southwest ‚Äî down the Ohio River and toward Vicksburg, Mississippi. Following their transfer at Memphis, Tennessee to the Prima Donna and further sailing, they disembarked at Helena, where they were attached to General David Steward's Division in Major-General William Tecumseh Sherman's 15th U.S. Army.Brinkerhoff, History of the Thirtieth Regiment Ohio Volunteer Infantry, pp. 51‚Äì54. Moved to Young's Point, Louisiana, the 30th Ohioans continued on toward Vicksburg, positioning themselves at the mouth of the canal just outside of the city. While here, they helped strengthen Union fortifications and improve the canal to facilitate the movement of Union troops and supplies. Moved to a site above Vicksburg sometime in late February, they encamped there until receiving orders to sail again. Disembarking at Eagle Bend, part of the regiment discovered plans for Confederate troop movements and other important documents at the abandoned mansion of U.S. Senator William M. Gwin on March 17 while the remainder of the regiment continued on until disembarking at Hill's plantation on March 21. Fully reconstituted the next day, the regiment moved on, leaving small detachments of its men at three different villas ‚Äî \\"Reality\\", \\"Good Intent\\", and Kelsey's, where they discovered a large number of cotton bales marked \\"C.S.A\\". Ordered back to Louisiana later that month, the 30th Ohioans sailed aboard the gunboats Cincinnati and Mound City, disembarking again at Young's Point on March 28. Ordered to assemble with other Union troops at \\"General Blair's headquarters\\", they were present for the April 21 address by Brigadier-General Lorenzo Thomas, Adjutant General of the U.S. Army, during which he announced President Lincoln's intention \\"to arm the negroes and to officer them from the army.\\"Brinkerhoff, History of the Thirtieth Regiment Ohio Volunteer Infantry, pp. 54‚Äì59. On April 29, the regiment boarded the steamer R.B. Hamilton, and sailed for the mouth of the Yazoo River, where it connected with other Union troops on the gunboats Choctaw and Tyler, the ironclad Byron de Kalb, four \\"musquito\\" boats, and the USS Black Hawk. General Sherman then boarded the Hamilton with the 30th Ohio as the expedition set off, and announced that the combined force would \\"make a demonstration upon Hain's Bluff to attract the attention of the enemy while General Grant effected a landing upon the Mississippi shore at Grand Gulf.\\" Shelling points along the way, the troops disembarked near Drumgold's Hill, and moved out with the 30th Ohio in the lead and two of its right-wing companies deployed as skirmishers. Battered by enemy artillery en route, the regiment sheltered behind a levee near Drumgold's, and then bedded down after nightfall. During the ensuing standoff over the next few days, both sides deployed skirmishers and exchanged artillery fire, ultimately compelling the Confederate troops to abandon their heavily fortified positions. Returned by gunboat to Young's Point, the 30th Ohioans were then redirected to Milliken's Bend, where they encamped briefly before being ordered to move, on May 5, toward Richmond and New Carthage.Brinkerhoff, History of the Thirtieth Regiment Ohio Volunteer Infantry, pp. 59‚Äì63. On May 9, Pvt. Brown and his fellow G Company soldiers joined those from Companies E, F and K in guarding the Union's commissary at Richmond. They then rejoined their regiment at Milliken's Bend the next day after the commissary's stores were moved to a safer location. During this phase of duty, they saw frequent examples of the suffering endured by local residents, a number of whom approached Union troops for food or other forms of assistance. Ordered onward again on May 13, they boarded the steamer Golden Era. Disembarking again at Young's Point, Louisiana, they marched along a new road which had been built across the Cypress Swamps until reaching a plantation just outside of Warrenton, where they were ordered to take shelter during a heavy rain by bedding down in the cabins of former slaves. Boarding the Silver Wave the next day, they reached Grand Gulf, where they disembarked and began a march toward Jackson. Five miles later, they made camp. The next morning (May 16), they continued on, marching an additional 23 miles before re-encamping again. While here, they learned that Jackson had been captured by Union forces two days earlier. Resuming their march the next day, they moved north toward the railroad, marching for an additional 25 miles before re- encamping yet again. On May 18, they marched an additional 35 miles, making camp within a quarter mile of Vicksburg. On May 19, they joined with other Union troops in assaulting Fort Beauregard during the Siege of Vicksburg.Brinkerhoff, History of the Thirtieth Regiment Ohio Volunteer Infantry, pp. 63‚Äì68. According to Brinkerhoff: > Every one expected another complete victory. General Ewing encouraged his > Brigade with the remark that \\"it would be a short job, and that we would be > inside of the works, in less than ten minutes after receiving the order to > move.\\" We were to charge in line of battle at two o'clock. The Thirtieth was > retained as a reserve, and the 4th Virginia, the 37th and 47th Ohio, ordered > to charge.... The enemy opened a terrible fire upon them, of musketry, > grape, cannister, and shell, and death ruled the hour....

No preparations had been made to cross this ditch or scale the works. > The enemy ... opened his musketry and artillery with redoubled fury; and our > men ... retired to the first cover, laid down, and awaited orders from the > Brigade commander.Brinkerhoff, History of the Thirtieth Regiment Ohio > Volunteer Infantry, pp. 69‚Äì70. Repulsed, the Kanawha Brigade retreated, regrouped, and resumed their role as part of the Union's siege efforts. Ordered to move again during the afternoon of May 22, the 30th Ohioans positioned themselves \\"on the top of the west slope of our hollow, within four hundred yards of the enemy, and opened a rapid fire upon him\\", according to Brinkerhoff. They had just fired their opening shots in the Battle of Vicksburg.Brinkerhoff, History of the Thirtieth Regiment Ohio Volunteer Infantry, pp. 70‚Äì71. Battle of Vicksburg (May 22, 1863) Battle of Vicksburg, Virginia, May 22, 1863 (U.S. Library of Congress). While stationed in Mississippi with his regiment during the third year of the American Civil War, Brown was pressed into service as \\"a member of what is known as the 'volunteer storming party' or 'forlorn hope' on May 22, 1863, at Vicksburg,\\" according to a sketch of his life which was presented in the Observer-Reporter of Washington, Pennsylvania in 2013. Attacking Vicksburg a second time in response to orders from General Ulysses S. Grant, Brown and a significant number of his comrades from the 30th Ohio and other Union regiments were wounded while attempting to place ladders against an embankment and the side of Fort Beauregard.\\"History of Hero\\", Observer-Reporter.

Afterward, assaults continued on the fort and on the city itself as the Siege of Vicksburg wore on. On the Fourth of July, 1863, the city finally fell when Lt. General John C. Pemberton and his Confederate troops surrendered to Union Army leaders. After recovering from his battle-related wound,Brinkerhoff, History of the Thirtieth Regiment Ohio Volunteer Infantry, pp. 71‚Äì81, p. 95. Brown returned to duty with his regiment.

He sacrificed his life to help his inebriated lord escape an assassination attempt by Zhu Wen (Zhu Quanzhong) in Zhu's territory. Biography Shi Jingsi was from Yanmen (ÈõÅÈñÄ; around modern Datong, Shanxi) and started his career as an assistant captain (ÁâôÊ†°) there. Once the Shatuo leader Li Keyong took over Yanmen, Shi was named the protector-general (ÈÉΩÁù£) of nine districts (Â∫ú). He was further promoted to an assistant general (Ë£®Â∞á) in the major city of Taiyuan (in modern Shanxi), the capital of Li Keyong's administrative territory. In early 884, Li Keyong led his troops to attack the anti-government rebel force of Huang Chao, and Shi was the vanguard general to assist the besieged cities of Chenzhou (Èô≥Â∑û; in modern Zhoukou, Henan) and Xuzhou (Ë®±Â∑û; in modern Xuchang, Henan). Huang then besieged Bianzhou (Ê±¥Â∑û; modern Kaifeng, Henan) as Bianzhou's Xuanwu (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶; headquartered at Bianzhou) military governor Zhu Wen (Zhu Quanzhong) sought emergency aid from Li Keyong. Li soundly defeated Huang near Bianzhou, and Shi chased the enemy until Xuzhou (in modern Jiangsu) and Yanzhou (ÂÖóÂ∑û; around modern Jinxiang County, Shandong). He would often fight at the forefront and was well known for his bravery. On 11 June 884, Shi accompanied Li as the latter accepted an invitation from Zhu for a feast in Bianzhou to celebrate the victories. At the banquet, Li got very drunk and verbally offended Zhu, although Zhu, an ambitious man in a time of almost nonexistent imperial control, possibly already had unspeakable intentions all along. After Li retreated to the so-called Shangyuan Lodging (‰∏äÊ∫êÈ©õ), Zhu dispatched hundreds of soldiers to kill him. The assassins placed felled trees, fences and wagons around the place to prevent anyone from escaping. With Li taking a long time to wake up, Shi, who also consumed much wine, climbed a tower and killed dozens of assassins using arrows. While other guards including Li Siyuan helped Li Keyong escape in the downpour of the night, Shi stayed behind and fended off Zhu's soldiers at a bridge until he was tragically butchered. Li Keyong climbed the city wall to escape to safety, mourned Shi deeply, and began (although not immediately) a warfare with Zhu that would span several decades. Shi Jingsi's son Shi Jiantang (Âè≤Âª∫Áë≠) would become a notable general under Li Keyong and Li's successor Li Cunxu. Modern reference Shi Jingsi's heroics were reenacted in the 1970 Hong Kong martial arts film The Heroic Ones, where he was portrayed by Ti Lung.

The Stanwood homestead, standing near the road, is a modest c. 1850 Cape style wood-frame house, which housed much original material, including artifacts of Cordelia Stanwood, prior to the 2014 fire. Stanwood was a self-taught ornithologist and naturalist who devoted 50 years of her life to studying the birds and nature of the area around her homestead. Following her death in 1958, community activists joined together to acquire her property, which was opened as a museum and sanctuary in 1960. The wildlife sanctuary, now enlarged to about , has a network of trails, some of which were laid out by Stanwood, and feature a variety of landscapes and habitats in which different types of birds may be observed. A nature center, built in 1990, houses a collection of mounted birds and mammals, as well as a collection of eggs and nests. Some parts of this collection are more than 100 years old.

Course and hydrology Net Creek begins from the south end of Rib Lake in Best Township. From there it flows about south into Petraut Lake. It then flows to the south-southwest into Duncan Lake where it runs another south-southwest into Ferguson Lake. At the south end of Ferguson Lake the creek then flows south-southwest into Net Lake. From the south end of Outlet Bay, Net Creek flows south-southeast into Cassels Lake. The creek has an approximate elevation of and has a length of about . Net Creek is part of the Ottawa River drainage basin, a large area covering much of eastern Ontario and western Quebec where water drains into the Ottawa River. After Net Creek flows into Cassels Lake, the water enters Rabbit Lake, which is drained by the Matabitchuan River. The Matabitchuan River then flows into Lake Timiskaming where the water eventually enters the Ottawa River. Outflow of Net Lake into Net Creek is controlled by the high Net Creek Dam (). The dam was originally built around the 1920s by the Temagami Timber Company but was rebuilt in 1974 with the purpose of controlling water levels in Net Lake.

Hobbs, Brockunier and Company was one of the largest and best known manufacturers of glass in the United States in the 19th century. Its products were distributed world-wide. The company is responsible for one of the greatest innovations in American glassmaking‚Äîan improved formula for lime glass that enabled American glass makers to produce high-quality glass at a lower cost. The firm also developed many of the talented glassmakers that started glass factories in Ohio and Indiana. The firm was first organized as Barnes and Hobbs in 1845 by James B. Barnes and John L. Hobbs. Both men held supervisory positions at the New England Glass Company in Massachusetts before starting their business venture. They came to a small community near the south side of Wheeling, Virginia, to begin their new glassmaking company. The firm was reorganized multiple times during the next half century, but members of the Hobbs family were always part of the ownership. The most famous iteration of the company was named J. H. Hobbs, Brockunier and Company. This version of the firm was organized in 1863 as a co-partnership between John L. Hobbs, son John H. Hobbs, and Charles W. Brockunier. Its products were mostly pressed and blown tableware. In 1891, the Hobbs glass works joined the United States Glass Company trust. The trust controlled over a dozen glass plants. In 1893, the glass works was closed. It remained closed until 1902 when the property was sold to Harry Northwood‚Äîa former employee of J. H. Hobbs, Bruckunier and Company. Wheeling Drawing of the J.H. Hobbs, Brockunier & Co. glass works circa 1870s A good transportation system made Wheeling an ideal location for a glass factory during the 19th century. Wheeling is located on the Ohio River at the river's intersection with the National Road. During the 1840s, waterways were the best mode for inter-city transportation. America's railroad network was still in its infancy, especially west of the Appalachian Mountains. The Ohio and Mississippi Rivers were an easy way to ship products to large cities such as Cincinnati, Louisville, St. Louis, and New Orleans. Glassmaking required high quantities of fuel to melt the raw materials used to make glass. Coal was the fuel of choice for making glass during much of the 19th century, succeeding wood and eventually succeeded by natural gas. Wheeling and the surrounding area was part of the Ohio Coal Belt, and coal was mined nearby. Wheeling is part of the northern strip of West Virginia, located in Ohio County between the states of Ohio and Pennsylvania. The city was part of Virginia until 1863, when the state of West Virginia was admitted to the Union during the American Civil War. The area's excellent transportation infrastructure, which included the National Road and the Ohio River, improved in late December 1852, when the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad reached Wheeling. More railroads were constructed during the following years, including across the river in Ohio. Ritchietown and South Wheeling The independent community of Ritchietown was located south of Wheeling on the Ohio River. Ritchietown is named after John Ritchie, who along with Samuel Sprigg owned much of the land in the area. Among John Ritchie's business interests was a glass works, which was started in 1829. The Plunkett and Miller glass works was started in Ritchietown around 1837. The company had a 10-pot furnace, but was bankrupt after a few years of production. In 1850, Ritchietown was incorporated, and changed its name to South Wheeling. The community changed names again in 1870, when it became part of the city of Wheeling as its Eighth Ward. Startup In 1845, James B. Barnes and John L. Hobbs moved to the Ohio River community of Ritchietown to start a new glass company named Barnes and Hobbs. The two men leased the former Plunkett and Miller glass works, which was owned by creditors of the bankrupt firm. Both men had worked in supervisory positions at the New England Glass Company in Massachusetts. Their sons, James F. Barnes and John H. Hobbs, joined the business early in its existence. The glass works consisted of two furnaces with a total of 14 pots. Coal was available nearby. Because no railroads had been built east of the Allegany Mountains, the Ohio River and National Road were the major transportation resources. Name changes Advertisement from 1861 The elder Mr. Barnes died in 1849. At that time, the company was reorganized as Hobbs, Barnes and Company, with the two Hobbs men and younger Barnes as the owners. Not only did the glass company change its name, the community where the glass works was located also changed its name. In 1850, the community of Ritchietown incorporated as South Wheeling. The expansion of what was, at that time, the American West, increased demand for glassware. In response, the company built another furnace in 1854. The firm was again renamed. The company became Barnes, Hobbs and Company, and was owned by John L. Hobbs, James F. Barnes, John H. Hobbs, and J. K. Dunham. By 1858, kerosene lamps and lanterns became popular in the United States. The company began making additional products: lamps and chimneys (the glass that surrounds the wick of the lamp). Demand for these products was so strong that the company could not produce enough of them. The company also changed its name again‚Äîthis time to Hobbs and Barnes. In addition to its South Wheeling glass works, the firm had an outlet for its products in Wheeling. The American Civil War began in 1861, and many employees of the Hobbs and Barnes glass works enlisted in the Union Army. The furnace of the company's glass works was shut down for about half of the year. The company continued operations, but had difficulty finding skilled workers. In 1863, James F. Barnes retired, and the co-partnership of Hobbs and Barnes was dissolved. A new co-partnership was formed, consisting of John L. Hobbs, John H. Hobbs, and Charles W. Brockunier. The firm was named J. H. Hobbs, Brockunier and Company. The newest partner, Charles W. Brockunier began working at the South Wheeling glass works in the 1850s. He had \\"superior business abilities\\" and was also one of West Virginia's pioneers in oil development. The stated purpose of the new firm was \\"manufacturing Flint and Fancy Colored Glassware, in all its branches, at the Works, South Wheeling.\\" The Hobbs and Barnes glassware and china outlet was also renamed. Another name change occurred later in 1863, when the northwestern portion of Virginia, including Wheeling, became the state of West Virginia. Golden era J. H. Hobbs, Brockunier & Company Peach Blow Vase, 1886, on display in the Walters Art MuseumHobnail Finger Bowl, after 1886. Metropolitan Museum of Art. The next twenty-five years were a golden era for the South Wheeling glassworks. The firm became \\"famous for the variety, quality, and beauty of its pressed ware, and the richness of its cut, engraved and blown ware\\". Wheeling became a \\"hub for chemical and technological improvements to the composition of glass and the development of furnaces, molds, and presses\\" for making glass. J. H. Hobbs, Brockunier & Company was the most important glass manufacturer in West Virginia, and one of the most important in the United States. Glass formula During early 1863, John L. Hobbs (the elder Hobbs) became convinced that glass made with lime instead of lead would be a better product. He began testing various combinations of ingredients to make high quality glass without lead, but his experiments were not successful. In the fall of the same year, William Leighton Sr. joined the firm as a partner, and continued the experiments with lime glass. Leighton came from a glass making family, and had worked at New England Glass Company. In 1864, Leighton had success. His major change in the formula for glass was using bicarbonate of soda instead of soda ash. His formula was similar to the long-lost soda-lime formula used many years earlier in Europe. The glass made using this formula had good enough quality that the company could compete in the high-end of the glassware market. This improvement in the formula for glass was considered one of two great advances in American glassmaking during the 19th century, the other being the invention of pressing. The ingredients used to make the glass were lower-cost than those used to make lead glass. In addition, the glass cooled faster, meaning the workforce would press it quicker. Thus, the new formula produced high-quality glass at lower costs for both ingredients and labor. Leighton retired in 1868, and was replaced as a partner in the firm by his son, William Leighton Jr. The elder Leighton already made his mark on the glass industry, as his new recipe for glass caused glassware to be available to the consumer at about 25 percent of the cost prior to his discovery. The drop in prices created new demand for glass products‚Äîcausing new factories to be built and old factories to increase capacity. 1870s By 1873, the glass works was the oldest in America west of the Allegany Mountains. Its facilities occupied square, and had three furnaces with a combined capacity of 29 pots. Benzine was used as a fuel for the furnace because its lack of sulfur produced clearer glass. The works employed about 300 people, and its annual revenue was about $325,000 (about $8.1 million in 2013 dollars). During the rest of the decade, furnaces were rebuilt and capacity was increased to a total of 32 pots. In 1879, one furnace was converted to gas as its fuel, and was considered the largest in the United States. About 350 people were employed at the works at that time. The company's goods were sold on four continents. Products included \\"all articles of glass for table use, engraved, cut and etched; bar goods, lamps, chandeliers and epergnes.\\" J. H. Hobbs, Brockunier and Company was the largest glass company in America. Hobbs, Brockunier and Company John L. Hobbs died in 1881, and the remaining partners purchased his stake in the firm. The company was renamed Hobbs, Brockunier and Company. In the early 1880s, the firm began making European- style glassware. By the mid-1880s, it had improved enough on the European designs that European manufacturers began emulating products from Wheeling. The glass works was shipping about 400 railroad carloads per year. Sales offices were kept in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. Its colored ware was popular, and the works produced more ruby glass than the rest of the nation combined. Hobbs Glass Company In 1887, Charles W. Brockunier retired for health reasons, and Hobbs, Brockunier and Company was dissolved. A new firm, the Hobbs Glass Company, was formed in 1888. Stockholders elected John H. Hobbs president. The Board of Directors consisted of Hobbs, Henry Schmulbach, A. J. Clarke, Howard Hazlett, and William Leighton, Jr. Talent provider Inventor Michael J. OwensThe company had a policy of using skilled glassworkers from Europe, who would train the local employees‚Äîresulting in a superior workforce. Former employees of the glass works became the talent that established many of the region's glass factories, and many were company president or plant manager. Perhaps the one former Hobbs employee that had the biggest influence on the industry was Michael Owens. Owens revolutionized the glass bottle industry by inventing a machine that would make bottles at high speed and low cost with consistency in size and shape. Not only did Owens' invention lower costs, it also opened new markets where low cost bottles with consistent size could be used as containers for products that previously had limited distribution. Owens was also involved with improving a machine for producing window glass, which changed the way window glass was produced. He was involved with the formation of the Toledo Glass Company, the Owens Bottle Machine Company, and the Libbey-Owens Sheet Glass Company. An early example of the Hobbs talent flow is the Belmont Glass Company, which began production during the 1860s. John Robinson, Charles Henry Over, and Henry Crimmel were former Hobbs and Barnes workers involved with the startup. Robinson and Over were on the company's board of directors, and Robinson was plant superintendent. Robinson and Over were also among the founders of the Bellaire Goblet Company in 1876. Years later (in 1888), Charles Henry Over founded the C. H. Over Glass Company. In 1893, John Robinson started the Robinson Glass Company. Henry Crimmel moved to Fostoria in 1887 to help with the startup of the Fostoria Glass Company. Crimmel owned a share of the company, and Crimmel glass recipes are thought to have been used by the company early in its existence. Crimmel was also a founder of the Novelty Glass Company and the reorganized version of the Sneath Glass Company. Another example of Hobbs worker talent is the Fostoria Glass Company, which was incorporated in 1887 by a group that included former Hobbs and Brockunier employees Lucien B. Martin, William S. Brady, James B. Russell, and Otto Jaeger. Martin was president, and Brady Vice President. Brady also became involved with the Fostoria Shade and Lamp Company. That company hired former Hobbs worker Nicholas Kopp, who became internationally known for his skill with colored glass and design work. When the Seneca Glass Company began operations in Fostoria, Ohio, in 1892, its first president was former Hobbs and Fostoria executive Otto Jaeger. Later Jaeger founded Bonita Art Glass in Wheeling. Decline The economy and labor difficulties led to the eventual closing of the Hobbs Glass Company. In addition, the plant's infrastructure was old. A fire damaged the facility in 1890, causing $30,000 (nearly $780,000 in 2013 dollars) in damages. U.S. Glass Advertisement for glassware made by the United States Glass Company. In 1891, a glass trust was formed in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The new firm was named United States Glass Company, and John H. Hobbs was on the board of directors. Initially, the Pittsburgh- based company consisted of 16 unionized glass works. Each factory became known by a letter (e.g. Factory A of United States Glass Company). Hobbs Glass Company became Factory H. Within the next year, representatives of the trust evaluated the 16 glass works. Factory H was thought to be old, have high expenses, and produce products that were costly to make. In addition, the process for making many of Factory H's products could not be easily mechanized. The United States was in an economic recession at the time of the formation of the glass trust. From management's point of view, United States Glass Company had been formed with the intention of making the unionized companies competitive with the non-union companies. Two ways to make the plants more competitive were to get concessions from the unions and to introduce more machines. From the point of view of the glass workers' union, United States Glass Company \\"took advantage of the hard times and slack business to get rid of the union.\\" The reality of the situation was the U.S. Glass trust was formed to \\"oppose the union and to introduce the automated equipment.\\" The American Flint Glass Workers Union was naturally opposed to mechanization or concessions, and it was strong enough that a single glass works could not oppose it. U.S. Glass built two large works (Gas City, Indiana and Glassport, Pennsylvania) that were highly automated‚Äîand could oppose unions at the other 16 plants. During the summer of 1892, workers at Factory H were notified that after the summer shutdown, their jobs would be vacant. Those that desired to work at the plant would need to apply to the new factory manager. On October 12, 1893, the American Flint Glass Workers began a strike. Glass was not produced at Factory H, although inventory was still being sold. In January 1894 U.S. Glass proposed that if the workers at its Wheeling plants would accept the terms of the labor agreements used in its Pittsburgh plants, work would start immediately. If the conditions were not accepted, then Wheeling's two glass works (including Factory H) would be torn down. The union rejected the proposed terms. Members of the union remained on strike until 1897. U.S. Glass survived by producing glass at its two large (and recently built) highly mechanized plants. Northwood Factory H was not torn down, and U.S. Glass was still maintaining the facility in early 1895. In 1902, the plant was sold to Harry Northwood. Northwood was an Englishman that worked at Hobbs, Brockunier and Company as an etcher in the 1880s. The company showcased his work at the West Virginia State Fair in 1882, which included etched pitchers and wine glasses. Northwood was considered \\"one of the leading glassmen of this country\\". His new glass works was H. Northwood and Company. The plant employed 300 people, and became well known for table ware. Northwood died in 1919, and his company closed in 1925. That was the end of glassmaking at the Wheeling glass works originally known as Barnes and Hobbs, and more famous as J. H. Hobbs, Brockunier, and Company.

Valencia Gonzales, 568 U.S. 57 (2013), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that a defendant on death row did not need to be held competent during federal habeas corpus proceedings.. Background Ernest Valencia Gonzales was convicted in Arizona of felony murder, armed robbery, aggravated assault, first-degree burglary and theft. Gonzales was sentenced to death for the stabbing of Darrel Wagner in front of his seven- year-old son. District court proceedings After exhausting appeals in Arizona, Gonzales filed for a writ of habeas corpus in District Court on November 15, 1999. While the petition was pending before the court, the appointed counsel for Gonzales filed the stay proceedings arguing that Gonzales was incapable or communicating rationally or assisting with proceedings. This argument was made under existing precedent with the Ninth Circuit (Rohan v. Wood). In Rohan the Appellate Court held that habeas proceedings could not \\"be faithfully enforced unless courts ensure that a petitioner is competent\\". Rohan continues that if the proceedings pending would benefit from the petitioner's competency then proceedings cannot continue as this would deny the right to assistance of counsel. When analyzing Rohan the District Court denied the stay, arguing that the issues before the court was a matter of law and would not benefit from Gonzales' input. Determining also that because the issue was a matter of law that the court did not need to determine whether or not Gonzales was competent. Gonzales then filed an emergency appeal for a writ of mandamus with the Ninth Circuit. Appellate proceedings While Gonzales' petition was before the court, the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion in Nash v. Ryan which held that habeas petitioner have a right to competence on appeal, even when the appeals only deal with matters of law. Applying Nash and Rohan the court granted the stay under Section 3599. The State of Arizona appealed to the Supreme Court which granted certiorari. Opinion of the Court The Court unanimously reversed the Ninth Circuit with Justice Thomas writing for the Court. The Court found that neither a statutory or a constitutional right exists to a petitioners competence in federal habeas corpus proceedings. Simply put because communication between counsel and defendant is unnecessary in these proceedings the district court cannot stay them. The district court should only stay proceedings if the defendant had a substantial likelihood of regaining competence, otherwise the stay of proceedings would unduly burn the justice system.

It was situated on the Isle of Dogs, East London. It was the fourth stadium that Millwall have occupied since their formation as a football club in 1885, and their last East London ground before they moved to South London. Millwall played 249 games in all competitions at North Greenwich, winning 153, losing 46 and with 50 drawn. History Preston in the 1902 FA Cup at North Greenwich. Millwall Athletic were forced to leave their third ground, The Athletic Grounds after the Millwall Dock Company told them they wanted to use it as a timberyard. The last game at the Athletic Grounds was a 4‚Äì0 win over Bristol City on 27 April 1901 in the Western League. Millwall relocated for the start of the 1901‚Äì02 season to a location near their second home, which became known as North Greenwich. Their first game at North Greenwich was against Portsmouth on 21 September 1901, which they lost 3‚Äì2. The Game was watched by 6,000 people. The last ever first-team game played on the Isle of Dogs was on 10 October 1910 against Woolwich Arsnenal in the London Challenge Cup. Millwall won the game 1‚Äì0 in front of a crowd of 3000.. Millwall Park now covers the land the ground used to stand on, and the railway viaduct forms part of the Docklands Light Railway. During the early 1900s supporters found it difficult to get on to the island to watch games, with severe congestion caused by increasing traffic in Millwall Docks. The Blackwall Tunnel opened in 1897 and the Greenwich Foot Tunnel in 1902 but due to lack of expansion space in the Millwall area of East London, Millwall moved to South London in 1910 and into their ground, The Den.

Farms surrounding the bridge were surveyed as early as 1720. In 1777, George Snell was considered the owner of the bridge by Montgomery County with George Darby listed as the road overseer. In November 1787, the State of Maryland funded a fifty-foot wide road to be built from Snell's Bridge and Greens Bridge upstream to Ellicott's Mills. Richard Green, Nathanial Owen, and John Ellicott were appointed commissioners for the project. The land next to the bridge is the birthplace of the Whig Major who ordered the Peggy Stuart burned. During the British invasion of the War of 1812, American troops led by William H. Winder retreated east across Snell's Bridge on August 26, 1814. The President stayed at Brookville, with the disorganized troops gathering at the bridge for the night. After camping overnight at the bridge, the General concluded that he should proceed directly to Baltimore in case the British were advancing northward leaving Brigadier General Stansbury in charge of the troops at camp. The British were at the same time leaving Washington, and boarded ships to sail the Potomac and Chesapeake toward Baltimore. In the 1840s, the state funded a replacement to Snell's Bridge. The modern bridge is a concrete arch built in 1928 along with the widening of route 108 in Howard County. The bridge replacement was funded via the 1920 Lateral and Post Roads Act.

It is located north-west of the state capital, Melbourne. History The Tragowel Plains Irrigation Trust (1886) and the Macorna North Irrigation Trust (1893), provided water for farms, crop irrigation and livestock. Burke and Wills The expedition by Burke and Wills to the Gulf of Carpentaria passed through the Tragowel area.http://geocaching.com.au/cache/ga2290 On 2 September 1860, the expedition, led by Robert O'Hara Burke, arrived at the homestead of Abraham Booth and John Holloway, called Tragowell Station (later renamed Tragowel Estate), on the Loddon River.. The homestead has since been demolished, but a piano played by Burke still exists, and is owned by Holloway's grandson. Demographics In the 2011 census, Tragowel was listed as a state suburb of Victoria. The area also encompassed parts of Appin, Dingwall, Kerang East, Lake Meran and Macorna. On census night, the population of Tragowel was 336,http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2011/quickstat/SSC21363?opendocument&navpos;=220 which included 178 males and 158 females, with a median age of 43. 262 (or 77.7%) residents of Tragowel were born in Australia. Other birthplaces include the Philippines (3.3%), England (1.5%) and Russia (0.9%). The remaining 16.6% did not disclose their country of birth. The religious affiliation of Tragowel is quite varied. 26.7% of residents identified themselves as Catholic, 14.8% Uniting Church, 7.4% Anglican and 7.1% Presbyterian and Reformed. 16.9% declared no religious affiliation. Transport Tragowel is not situated on any major highways, but the Loddon Valley Highway runs 4 km to the west of the town. There are currently no sealed roads leading into or out of the town. The Piangil railway line runs through the town, but Tragowel railway station closed in the 1970s and nothing remains of it. The nearest airport is located in Kerang.

He served the Shatuo leaders Li Keyong ‚Äî who adopted him as a son ‚Äî and Li Keyong's biological son and successor Li Cunxu. He died in the battles against Zhang Chujin. Biography Sun Chongjin was a native of the northern territory called Zhenwu (ÊåØÊ≠¶; around modern Hohhot, Inner Mongolia). He began following Li Keyong when the latter attacked Shuozhou (in modern Shanxi) and became an adopted son some time later with the new name Li Cunjin. After the suppression of the rebel Huang Chao, Li Cunjin rose to a commissioner of Army of Righteous Sons (Áæ©ÂÖíËªç‰Ωø). After the death of Li Keyong, Li Cunjin served Li Keyong's successor Li Cunxu when their Jin state fought the Later Liang. In 910, Li Cunjin helped his lord win the battle at Baixiang County (in modern Hebei), and was promoted to inspector-in-chief of forces at large (Ë°åÁáüÈ¶¨Ê≠•ËªçÈÉΩËôûÂÄô) to govern Cizhou (ÊÖàÂ∑û; modern Ji County, Shanxi) and Qinzhou (Ê≤ÅÂ∑û; modern Qinyuan County, Shanxi). After 915, he became a chief officer (ÈÉΩÈÉ®ÁΩ≤) of the newly conquered Tianxiong Command (Â§©ÈõÑËªç). There he instilled strict measures on the surrendered Later Liang troops: anyone violating the regulations would be openly beheaded or dismembered, and this approach effectively prevented any possible unrest. He was promoted to military governor of Zhenwu Command (ÊåØÊ≠¶Ëªç; headquartered in modern Hohhot) after participating in the battles along the Yellow River. In 921, Zhang Wenli usurped the power in Zhao, eliciting a military response from Li Cunxu. The attacks were unsuccessful as many Jin generals died in battles, including Li Sizhao. Li Cunxu then asked Li Cunjin to replace Li Sizhao as the commissioner of bandit suppression (ÊãõË®é‰Ωø). As the soil was poor at the crossing where he quartered his men, he was not able to construct ramparts, so palisades were made instead. When the palisade went under attack by the troops of Zhang Wenli's son Zhang Chujin, Li Cunjin rose atop a bridge to direct his troops and died in the battles. He was conferred a grand marshal (Â§™Â∞â) posthumously. His son Li Hanshao (ÊùéÊº¢Èü∂), later renamed Sun Hanshao (Â≠´Êº¢Èü∂), also became a military general.

The carrack, which was reputedly one of the richest ever to set sail from the Indies, was lost in an explosion which denied the English, as well as the Portuguese and Spanish, the riches.Horner pg. 229 Background By virtue of the Iberian Union, the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373 was in abeyance, and as the Anglo‚ÄìSpanish War was still ongoing, Portuguese shipping was a fair target for the English navy and privateers. At the latter end of 1593 the Earl of Cumberland, hoping to capitalize on the success of the capture of the Madre de Deus; prepared at his own expense three ships of 250 to 300 tons, with two artillery decks each and a total of 420 sailors and soldiers.Andrews pg. 76 These were the Royal Exchange, owned by London Merchants, William Holliday, Thomas Cordell and William Garraway and of which George Cave was captain, the Mayflower - Vice Admiral under the command of William Anthony, and the Sampson, under Nicholas Downton. There was also a support pinnace, the Violet.Williamson 126‚Äì37Oppenheim 310‚Äì11 George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland On 6 April 1594 they set sail from Plymouth, heading for the Azores. En route they roamed the coast of Portugal and Spain, capturing a number of ships. Off Viana do Castelo, Portugal, a 28 tonne barque was captured as it headed towards Portuguese Angola. Near the islands of Berlengas another three Portuguese and Spanish caravels were taken, one of which had twelve butts of Spanish wine and another a small chest of silver. These were sent back to England under prize crews aboard the Violet while the rest of the fleet continued towards the Azores. They were hoping to avoid Alonso de Baz√°n's Spanish fleet which was on the lookout for Cumberland, after his failure to intercept him two years earlier. On 22 June 1594, as they approached Faial island, the Mayflower soon saw a great sail approach them and realized this was a huge Portuguese carrack. The carrack was the Cinco Chagas (Five wounds) and was a thirty two gun 2000 ton carrack which had departed from Goa heading for Portugal in 1593, under the command of Francisco de Mello, one of the \\"greatest naus that ever were in the Carreira, loaded with great wealthness and precious stones and all the best of India\\". Constructed in Goa by the Viceroy Dom Constantino de Braganza in 1559-60, she had made ten voyages being the flagship of five viceroys. The rest of the fleet had consisted of the Santo Alberto and Nossa Senhora da Nazareth. However the Santo Alberto and Nazareth had sprung fatal leaks and were beached on Mozambique's coast. The Cinco Chagas took aboard such cargo in diamonds and other precious gems as had been salvaged from the two lost ships, as well their 400 passengers and crew members, of which 230 were slaves.Amaral pp. 45‚Äì57 Among them were also two VIPs: Nuno Velho Pereira, the former colonial governor of Mozambique, and Dom Braz Correia, the captain of the fleet that had been returning from the Indies. The Chagas called in at Luanda, in Portuguese Angola, for supplies, where they took aboard more slaves which constituted more mouths to feed. By the time the Chagas reached the Azores, disease had claimed almost half the complement, many of which were women and children, and much of the food provision had already been thrown overboard in order to lighten the ship during gales off South Africa. The carrack attempted to reach the island of Corvo in order to replenish these lost provisions, but contrary winds forbade this, and so she tacked towards Faial. Soon afterwards however, the lookouts on Chagas spotted the English ships, and prepared for battle. Battle At noon all four ships exchanged broadsides and musket volleys in a battle that lasted for nearly a whole day. The English ships tried to board the Cinco Chagas but were repelled by the larger Portuguese numbers. As casualties mounted on both sides the decks of the carrack were cluttered with dead and wounded. The battle went on with the English trying to board the ship three times. All three attempts however were repelled by the Portuguese - putting up a brave fight knowing the riches were too great to lose. The captain of the Mayflower George Cave was killed which discouraged his men from attacking. The crew of Sampson was repulsed with losses and fighting continued for several hours with the four ships moored to each other. Shortly after, the other two ships, having lost hope of mastering Chagas drifted off and Nicholas Downton was severely wounded and William Antony later was mortally wounded. Typical Portuguese carrack during most of the 16th century. By the end of 16th century, the \\"Cinco Chagas\\", had already differed from this design. However, on having noticed that Cinco Chagas had no guns aft, in a deft maneuver the English returned to the attack concentrating their fire on the stern panel of Portuguese ship. The Royal Exchange made another boarding attack this time succeeding in carrying the ship after bitter fighting. Whilst heavy hand-to-hand fighting was ongoing a fire had started on a tarpaulin during the exchange of fire and then spread further to the rigging and the masts. The fire could not be put out because sharpshooters on board the English ships were taking the Portuguese one by one as they tried to man the pumps. According to the only eyewitness account available, written by Melchior Est√°cio do Amaral in 1604: > the sea was purple with blood dripping from the scuppers, the decks > cluttered with the dead and the fire raging in some parts of the ships, and > the air so filled with smoke that, not only we could sometimes not see each > other but we could not recognize each other. Seeing the fire spreading out of control and with the English gaining the upper hand, the Portuguese decided to abandon the ship, grabbing anything that could float. At the same time the English came among them in some armed boats, and began shooting or lancing the helpless Portuguese in the water.Bernardo Gomes de Brito: Historia Tragico Maritima p520 It became apparent that the only people being spared this butchery were women who were stripping off their outer clothing, \\"in the hope of piety from the English\\"Horner, 1973 p109 However one lady, Dona Isabel Pereira, whose late husband Diogo de Melo Coutinho had been Captain-major and Tanadar-mor of Ceylon, and her 16-year-old daughter Dona Luisa de Melo Coutinho, steadfastly refused to undress for the privateers and, tying themselves together with a sash of St. Francis (i.e. the cord which a Franciscan friar would tie around his waist), they went to the opposite side of the ship from the English, and they leapt into the sea. They were buried on Faial where their dead bodies washed ashore, still bound together, the next day.Bernardo Gomes de Brito, Historia Tragico Maritima, p521. When the fire became completely out of control the English decided to lay off from the Chagas, and \\"worked furiously to disengage their ships\\" The carrack burned all through the night until just after dawn, when the flames reached the powder magazine in her lower hold, which contained \\"her poulder which was lowest being 60 barrels\\" which igniting, \\"blew her abroad, so that most of the ship did swim in parts above the water\\"Downton,The Principal Navigations, Voyages, Traffiques, and Discoveries of the English Nation, edited by Richard Hakluyt. The explosion was enormous, killing hundreds of Portuguese which included men, women and children; nearly 35 English were still aboard when the ship exploded. Most were killed outright and the battle ended with the total loss of the Chagas and its cargo. Aftermath The crew grabbed any floating remains that were of any use, which proved to be little, and the English began picking up any survivors, of which there were only thirteen out of 600 Portuguese. The English sailed further West in the hope of rich pickings, and encountered another carrack, the San Fellipe, two weeks later. With heavy losses already due to disease, and with officers wounded or killed, supplies running low, and a gale forcing them apart, Cumberland decided against engaging the carrack and sailed home. The cargo of Cinco Chagas (along with the salvaged cargo from the two other ships) was worth well in excess of 2,000,000 ducats, and in addition there were twenty-two treasure chests of diamonds, rubies, and pearls estimated to be worth US$15‚Äì20 billion by 2017 values.Horner on pg 229 quotes $1 billion, but he wrote in 1971 when monetary values were approximately one twentieth of 2017 values. The prisoners that were saved told their captors that yielding had been impossible as the riches were for the king of Spain and Portugal and that the captain, being highly in the king's favor, would upon his return have been made viceroy in the Indies. With the destruction of the Chagas, Cumberland had to satisfy himself that the Portuguese and Spanish were denied any of the riches on board. He successfully evaded attempts by the Spanish navy to find him. Alonso de Baz√°n failed to intercept Cumberland partly because he was hoping to protect the West Indian treasure fleet which was still in the Caribbean. Another fleet under Don Antonio De Urquiola also failed to find the English, despite his having been in the same area when they headed home past Cape St. Vincent in September. The fleet arrived in Portsmouth on 28 August, and the ships were thoroughly searched when they arrived by the Queens troops, a consequence of the mass theft from the Madre de Deus two years earlier. Dom Nuno Velho Pereira and Dom Braz Correia had survived the explosion of the Chagas and were brought ashore as prisoners, where the Earl treated them well and entertained them for a whole year as his guests. They were then ransomed for 2500 ducats each; Pereira paid for both making Cumberland's 1594 expedition gain at least some reward. With this money the Earl then decided to finance and build a new, larger ship, rather than borrowing from the Queen; the new ship was launched in 1595 and was named by the Queen the Scourge of Malice.Nichols (1823), pp 496‚Äì497. Legacy According to the Venetian ambassador to Spain, it was the richest ship ever to sail from the East Indies. Estimates of the Cinco Chagas's location suggest that it lies in seas over one mile deep in the Atlantic Ocean eighteen miles south of the channel between Pico Island and Faial along with its precious cargo of diamonds and gems. The wreck has been searched for by treasure hunters but no signs have been found partly due to the depth. However some of the other reasons for no sign of the Chagas having yet been found, are more compelling. One of the English captains, Nicholas Downton, recorded, \\"This fight was open off the Sound between Faial and Pico 6 leagues to the Southward\\",The Principal Navigations, Voyages, Traffiques, and Discoveries of the English Nation, by Richard Hakluyt a league being 3 nautical miles (3.45 statute miles), placing the scene of the battle 18 nautical miles (or 20.71 statute miles) from the Sound. This has been taken to mean that the battle was fought south of Faial. However, the currents in these waters form part of the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre, and flow through the Azores from NE to SW,http://earth.nullschool.net/#current/wind/surface/level/orthographic=-27.24,38.40,2048 Select \\"currents\\" and double click to zoom in. and hundreds of bodies washed ashore on Faial the day after the battleHorner, 1973 p112 which can only therefore have originated from a point north of Faial. Closer inspection of Downton's statement suggests that it may have been misread; it does not say, \\"This fight was open off the Sound between Faial and Pico, 6 leagues to the Southward\\" (note the comma), or \\" This fight was open off the Sound between Faial and Pico and 6 leagues to the Southward\\", it says that the battle took place off \\"...the Sound ... 6 leagues to the southward\\". In other words, it may be the Sound, not the battle, that was 6 leagues to the south. This explains the bodies washing up on Faial the next day, as Horner describes. Further, the Chagas had sailed towards Faial from Corvo, which she could not close due to contrary winds, but was apparently on the way to Terceira, the direct course to which passes just 20 miles -- 6 leagues -- north of the Faial-Pico channel. Bernardo Gomez de Brito, \\"Historia Tragico Maritima\\" (The Tragic History of the Sea), 1735 p.517) A further reason for the lack of serious search and salvage efforts is the fact that the Chagas' cargo was mainly loose gems which, upon the ship exploding, would have flown everywhere, before cascading down through approximately one mile of water and then settling into phytodetritic ooze, which is itself in the long and slow process of sliding down a mountain (Faial Island).Holcomb and Searle,\\"Large Landslides from Oceanic Volcanoes\\", 1991 This process has been aggravated by very devastating earthquakes which struck Faial in 1672, 1760, and particularly in 1926, a violent and prolonged underwater event at Pico in 1963 and a powerful event under both Pico and Faial in 1973 which had numerous aftershocks. Each of these events shuffles and shakes the entire region, triggering large and powerful submarine landslides, so that the remains of the Chagas and its cargo would slide further down the mountain and deeper under the mud. It would appear unlikely in the extreme that gemstones only millimeters across, small artifacts of interest or value or even the ship's large pieces of ordnance would presently remain at the surface of the sediment, and consequently, despite the fabulous wealth of the ship, the values of recovered treasures may not () exceed the expense of salvaging them.

PAMAM dendrimers, sometimes referred to by the trade name Starburst, have been extensively studied since their synthesis in 1985, and represent the most well-characterized dendrimer family as well as the first to be commercialized. Like other dendrimers, PAMAMs have a sphere-like shape overall, and are typified by an internal molecular architecture consisting of tree-like branching, with each outward 'layer', or generation, containing exponentially more branching points. This branched architecture distinguishes PAMAMs and other dendrimers from traditional polymers, as it allows for low polydispersity and a high level of structural control during synthesis, and gives rise to a large number of surface sites relative to the total molecular volume. Moreover, PAMAM dendrimers exhibit greater biocompatibility than other dendrimer families, perhaps due to the combination of surface amines and interior amide bonds; these bonding motifs are highly reminiscent of innate biological chemistry and endow PAMAM dendrimers with properties similar to that of globular proteins. The relative ease/low cost of synthesis of PAMAM dendrimers (especially relative to similarly-sized biological molecules such as proteins and antibodies), along with their biocompatibility, structural control, and functionalizability, have made PAMAMs viable candidates for application in drug development, biochemistry, and nanotechnology.  Synthesis   Divergent synthesis  A general scheme for the divergent synthesis of PAMAM dendrimers, with ethylene diamine as a core initiator. The scheme is color-coded by generation number, with the red ethylene diamine core serving as initiator core, orange as Generation 0 and orange/green as Generations 1, respectively. The scheme shown is currently the most widely adopted approach in commercial syntheses of PAMAM. Divergent synthesis refers to the sequential \\"growth\\" of a dendrimer layer by layer, starting with a core \\"initiator\\" molecule which contains functional groups capable of acting as active sites in the initial reaction. Each subsequent reaction in the series increases the number of available surface groups exponentially. Core molecules which give rise to PAMAM dendrimers can vary, but the most basic initiators are ammonia and ethylene diamine. Outward growth of PAMAM dendrimers is accomplished by alternating between two reactions: # Michael addition of the amino-terminated surface onto methyl acrylate, resulting in an ester- terminated outer layer, and # Coupling with ethylene diamine to achieve a new amino-terminated surface. Each round of reactions forms a new \\"generation\\", and PAMAM dendrimers are often classified by generation number; the common shorthand for this classification is \\"GX\\" or \\"GX PAMAM\\", where X is a number referring to the generation number. The first full cycle of Michael addition followed by coupling with ethylene diamine forms Generation 0 PAMAM, with subsequent Michael additions giving rise to \\"half\\" generations, and subsequent amide coupling giving rise to \\"full\\" (integer) generations. With divergent synthesis of dendrimers, it is extremely important to allow each reaction to proceed to completion; any defects caused by incomplete reaction or intramolecular coupling of new surface amines with unreacted methyl ester surface groups could cause \\"trailing\\" generations, stunting further growth for certain branches. These impurities are difficult to remove when using the divergent synthetic approach because the molecular weight, physical size, and chemical properties of the defective dendrimers are very similar in nature to the desired product. As generation number increases, it becomes more difficult to produce pure products in a timely fashion due to steric constraints. As a result, synthesis of higher-generation PAMAM dendrimers can take months.  Convergent synthesis  Convergent synthesis of a dendrimer begins with what will eventually become the surface of the dendrimer and proceeds inward. The convergent synthetic approach makes use of orthogonal protecting groups (two protecting groups whose deprotection conditions will not remove one another); this is an additional consideration not present when using a divergent approach. The figure below depicts a general scheme for a convergent synthetic approach. A generalized scheme outlining the use of orthogonal protecting groups for convergent synthesis of PAMAM dendrimers. Convergent synthesis as shown above begins with the dendritic subunit composed of reactive \\"focal group\\" A and branched group B (B can be multiply branched in the most generalized scenario, but PAMAMs only split once at each branching point). First, A is orthogonally protected and set aside for further reactions. B is also orthogonally protected, leaving the unprotected A on this molecule to couple with each of the unprotected B groups from the initial compound. This results in a new higher-generation species that is protected on both A and B. Selective deprotection of A yields a new molecule which can again be coupled onto the original monomer, thus forming another new generation. This process can then be repeated to form more and more layers. * Note that the black protecting groups for group B represent what will become the outermost layer of the final molecule, and remain attached throughout the synthetic process; their purpose is to guarantee that propagation of dendrimer growth can take place in a controlled fashion by preventing unwanted side reactions. * In forming each new layer, the number of AB couplings is restricted to two, in sharp contrast to the divergent synthetic approach, which involves exponentially more couplings per layer. * Incomplete reaction products (single addition adduct, unreacted starting materials) will have a markedly different molecular weight from the desired product, especially for higher-generation compounds, making purification more straightforward. * The reactive focal group A must be terminated onto a final acceptor at some point during the synthetic process; until then, each compound can only be considered a dendron and not a full dendrimer (see page for disambiguation). * An advantage to synthesizing dendrons with focal group A as a chemical handle is the ability to attach multiple equivalents of the dendron to a polyfunctional core molecule; changing the core element does not require rebuilding the entire dendrimer. In the case of PAMAM, the focal points of convergently synthesized fragments have been used to create unsymmetrical dendrimers as well as dendrimers with various core functionalization. * Since each successive generation of dendron becomes bulkier, with final attachment to the dendrimer core being the most prohibitive step of all, steric constraints can severely impact yield.  Toxicity   in vitro  It has been established that cationic macromolecules in general destabilize the cell membrane, which can lead to lysis and cell death. The common conclusion present in current work echoes this observation: increasing dendrimer molecular weight and surface charge (both being generation-dependent) increases their cytotoxic behavior. Initial studies on PAMAM toxicity showed that PAMAM was less toxic (in some cases, much less so) than related dendrimers, exhibiting minimal cytotoxicity across multiple toxicity screens, including tests of metabolic activity (MTT assay), cell breakdown (LDH assay), and nucleus morphology (DAPI staining). However, in other cell lines, the MTT assay and several other assays revealed some cytotoxicity. These disparate observations could be due to differences in sensitivity of the various cell lines used in each study to PAMAM; although cytotoxicity for PAMAM varies among cell lines, they remain less toxic than other dendrimer families overall. More recently, a series of studies by Mukherjee et al. have shed some light on the mechanism of PAMAM cytotoxicity, providing evidence that the dendrimers break free of their encapsulating membrane (endosome) after being absorbed by the cell, causing harm to the cell's mitochondria and eventually leading to cell death. Further elucidation of the mechanism of PAMAM cytotoxicity would help resolve the dispute as to precisely how toxic the dendrimers are. In relation to neuronal toxicity, fourth generation PAMAM has been shown to break down calcium transients, altering neurotransmitter vesicle dynamics and synaptic transmission. All of the above can be prevented by replacing the surface amines with folate or polyethylene glycol. It has also been shown that PAMAM dendrimers cause rupturing of red blood cells, or hemolysis. Thus, if PAMAM dendrimers are to be considered in biological applications that involve dendrimers or dendrimer complexes traveling through the bloodstream, the concentration and generation number of unmodified PAMAM in the bloodstream should be taken into account.  in vivo  To date, few in-depth studies on the in vivo behavior of PAMAM dendrimers have been carried out. This could be in part due to the diverse behavior of PAMAMs depending on surface modification (see below), which make characterization of their in vivo properties largely case-dependent. Nonetheless, the fate and transport of unmodified PAMAM dendrimers is an important case study as any biological applications could involve unmodified PAMAM as a metabolic byproduct. In the only major systematic study of in vivo PAMAM behavior, injections of high levels of bare PAMAMs over extended periods of time in mice showed no evidence of toxicity up through G5 PAMAM, and for G3-G7 PAMAM, low immunogenicity was observed. These systemic-level observations seem to align with the observation that PAMAM dendrimers are not extremely cytotoxic overall; however, more in-depth studies of the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of PAMAM are required before a move toward in vivo applications can be made.  Surface modification  One unique property of dendrimers such as PAMAM is the high density of surface functional groups, which allow many alterations to be made to the surface of each dendrimer molecule. In putative PAMAM dendrimers, the surface is rife with primary amines, with higher generations expressing exponentially greater densities of amino groups. Although the potential to attach many things to each dendrimer is one of their greatest advantages, the presence of highly localized positive charges can be toxic to cells. Surface modification via attachment of acetyl and lauroyl groups help mask these positive charges, attenuating cytotoxicity and increasing permeability to cells. Thus, these types of modifications are especially beneficial for biological applications. Secondary and tertiary amino surface groups are also found to be less toxic than primary amino surface groups, suggesting it is charge shielding which has major bearing on cytotoxicity and not some secondary effect from a particular functional group. Furthermore, other studies point to a delicate balance in charge which must be achieved to obtain minimal cytotoxicity. Hydrophobic interactions can also cause cell lysis, and PAMAM dendrimers whose surfaces are saturated with nonpolar modifications such as lipids or polyethylene glycol (PEG) suffer from higher cytotoxicity than their partially substituted analogues. PAMAM dendrimers with nonpolar internal components have also been shown to induce hemolysis.  Applications  Applications involving dendrimers in general take advantage of either stuffing cargo into the interior of the dendrimer (sometimes referred to as the \\"dendritic box\\"), or attaching cargo onto the dendrimer surface. PAMAM dendrimer applications have generally focused on surface modification, taking advantage of both electrostatic and covalent methods for binding cargo. Currently, major areas of study using PAMAM dendrimers and their functionalized derivatives involve drug delivery and gene delivery.  Drug delivery  Since PAMAM dendrimers have shown penetration capability to a wide range of cell lines, simple PAMAM- drug complexes would affect a broad spectrum of cells upon introduction to a living system. Thus, additional targeting ligands are required for the selective penetration of cell types. For example, PAMAM derivatized with folic acid is preferentially taken up by cancer cells, which are known to overexpress the folate receptor on their surfaces. Attaching additional treatment methods along with the folic acid, such as boron isotopes, cisplatin, and methotrexate have proven quite effective. In the future, as synthetic control over dendrimer surface chemistry becomes more robust, PAMAM and other dendrimer families may rise to prominence alongside other major approaches to targeted cancer therapy. In a study of folic acid functionalized PAMAM, methotrexate was combined either as an inclusion complex within the dendrimer or as a covalent surface attachment. In the case of the inclusion complex, the drug was released from the dendrimer interior almost immediately when subjected to biological conditions and acted similarly to the free drug. The surface attachment approach yielded stable, soluble complexes which were able to selectively target cancer cells and did not prematurely release their cargo. Drug release in the case of the inclusion complex could be explained by the protonation of surface and interior amines under biological conditions, leading to unpacking of the dendrimer conformation and consequent release of the inner cargo. A similar phenomenon was observed with complexes of PAMAM and cisplatin. PAMAM dendrimers have also demonstrated intrinsic drug properties. One quite notable example is the ability for PAMAM dendrimers to remove prion protein aggregates, the deadly protein aggregates responsible for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (\\"mad cow disease\\") and Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob disease in humans. The solubilization of prions is attributed to the polycationic and dendrimeric nature of the PAMAMs, with higher generation (>G3) dendrimers being the most efficient; hydroxy-terminated PAMAMs as well as linear polymers showed little to no effect. Since there are no other known compounds capable of dissolving prions which have already aggregated, PAMAM dendrimers have offered a bit of reprieve in the study of such fatal diseases, and may offer additional insight into the mechanism of prion formation.  Gene therapy  Surface amine residues on PAMAM dendrimers bind to the phosphate backbone of nucleic acids through charged interactions (right, inset). Typically, G6-7 PAMAM dendrimers are used for gene transfection; these dendrimers are typically 6-10nm in length (spanning ~20-30 base pairs) and have a molecular mass of 30-50kDa. The discovery that mediating positive charge on PAMAM dendrimer surfaces decreases their cytotoxicity has interesting implications for DNA transfection applications. Because the cell membrane has a negatively charged exterior, and the DNA phosphate backbone is also negatively charged, the transfection of free DNA is not very efficient simply due to charge repulsion. However, it would be reasonable to expect charged interactions between the anionic phosphate backbone of DNA and the amino-terminated surface groups of PAMAM dendrimers, which are positively ionized under physiological conditions. This could result in a PAMAM-DNA complex, which would make DNA transfection more efficient due to neutralization of the charges on both elements, while the cytotoxicity of the PAMAM dendrimer would also be reduced. Indeed, several reports have confirmed PAMAM dendrimers as effective DNA transfection agents. When the charge balance between DNA phosphates and PAMAM surface amines is slightly positive, the maximum transfection efficiency is obtained; this finding supports the idea that the complex binds to the cell surface via charge interactions. A striking observation is that \\"activation\\" of PAMAM by partial degradation via hydrolysis improves transfection efficiency by 2-3 orders of magnitude, providing further evidence supporting the existence of an electrostatically coupled complex. The fragmentation of some branches of the dendrimer is thought to loosen up the overall structure (fewer amide bonds and space constraints), which would theoretically result in better contact between the dendrimer and DNA substrate because the dendrimer is not forced into a rigid spherical conformation due to sterics. This in turn results in more compact DNA complexes which are more easily endocytosed. After endocytosis, the complexes are subjected to the acidic conditions of the cellular endosome. The PAMAM dendrimers act as a buffer in this environment, soaking up the excess protons with multitudes of amine residues, leading to the inhibition of pH-dependent endosomal nuclease activity and thus protecting the cargo DNA. The tertiary amines on the interior of the dendrimer can also participate in the buffering activity, causing the molecule to puff up; additionally, as the PAMAMs take on more and more positive charge, fewer of them are required for the optimal PAMAM-DNA interaction, and free dendrimers are released from the complex. Dendrimer release and swelling can eventually lyse the endosome, resulting in release of the cargo DNA. The activated PAMAM dendrimers have less spatial barrier to interior amine protonation, which is thought to be a major source of their advantage over non-activated PAMAM. PAMAM dendrimers can be \\"activated\\" for gene transfer applications via hydrolysis accelerated by heat, a process which can be thought of as similar to shearing bushes. During this process, amide bonds are broken and replaced with carboxyl groups (see inset), causing some branches of the dendrimer to fall off. The overall molecular mass of the dendrimer is reduced by 20-25%, and the result is a more flexible dendrimer with transfection efficiencies improved by 2-3 orders of magnitude. In the context of existing approaches to gene transfer, PAMAM dendrimers hold a strong position relative to major classical technologies such as electroporation, microinjection, and viral methods. Electroporation, which involves pulsing electricity through cells to create holes in the membrane through which DNA can enter, has obvious cytotoxic effects and is not appropriate for in vivo applications. On the other hand, microinjection, the use of fine needles to physically inject genetic material into the cell nucleus, offers more control but is a high- skill, meticulous task in which a relatively low number of cells can be transfected. Although viral vectors can offer highly specific, high-efficiency transfection, the generation of such viruses is costly and time-consuming; furthermore, the inherent viral nature of the gene transfer often triggers an immune response, thus limiting in vivo applications. In fact, many modern transfection technologies are based on artificially assembled liposomes (both liposomes and PAMAMs are positively charged macromolecules). Since PAMAM dendrimers and their complexes with DNA exhibit low cytotoxicity, higher transfection efficiencies than liposome-based methods, and are effective across a broad range of cell lines, they have taken an important place in modern gene therapy methodologies. The biotechnology company Qiagen currently offers two DNA transfection product lines (SuperFect and PolyFect) based on activated PAMAM dendrimer technology. Much work lies ahead before activated PAMAM dendrimers can be used as in vivo gene therapy agents. Although the dendrimers have proved to be highly efficient and non-toxic in vitro, the stability, behavior, and transport of the transfection complex in biological systems has yet to be characterized and optimized. As with drug delivery applications, specific targeting of the transfection complex is ideal and must be explored as well.

They trace their wealth to chemist Ludwig Reimann, who, in 1828, joined with Johann Adam Benckiser (founder of the namesake chemical company). Reimann married one of Benckiser's daughters and ended up owning the business. Great-grandson Albert Reimann Jr. took over after his father died in 1952 and added consumer goods. Initially, each of the nine children had inherited 11.1% ownership in JAB upon Albert's death in 1984. In the following years, five of the heirs sold their stakes to the other four: Matthias Reimann-Andersen, Renate Reimann-Haas, Stefan Reimann-Andersen and Wolfgang Reimann. As of January 2015, each of the four owns about $3.8 billion in JAB shares. The primary shareholder of JAB, as listed in its 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements, is Austrian-domiciled company Agnaten SE. Agnaten is listed, by PrivCo, as a subsidiary of Joh. A. Benckiser GmbH, the investment vehicle of the Reimann family.  Controversy  On 24 March 2019, the family admitted that Albert Reimann Sr. and Albert Reimann Jr. were supporters of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party, and that historical research revealed that the company used 175 forced labourers and employed a foreman who was known for his cruel treatment from 1943 onwards. The family has vowed to give ‚Ç¨10 million (US$11.3 million) to charity. Two months later, several of the Reimanns revealed to The New York Times that their mother, Emilie Landecker, Albert Jr.'s mistress, baptized as a Catholic like her mother, was the daughter of Alfred Landecker, a Jewish man deported to the Izbica Ghetto in 1942. His ultimate fate is unknown although many Jews sent to Izbica were held there pending transport to the Belzec and Sobibor extermination camps. They have renamed the family foundation after him and doubled its budget to ‚Ç¨25 million (US$28.2 million), to fund projects that honor the victims of the Holocaust and Nazism.

It is based on an original screen play. It is a film about the belief in a fated destiny vs. the free will to form a future.  Plot  Steven, played by Sean Harris, lives in an isolated fishing village. He is a fish gutter who uses his meager earnings to view his future in illegal time machine. These time machines have been outlawed by the government due to their unintended consequences. Steven knows someday he will be loved and the woman will be-a psychiatric nurse in his future. However, his love is presently Bryony Lafferty, an 8-year-old girl. He is only in love with the adult Bryony. Steven hints about the future with a local bus driver. Steven realizes that the bus driver also uses the illegal time booths but the driver‚Äôs experience has shown an unhappy outcome for the bus driver's marriage. Steven tells the driver that the bus driver should not worry, as the future may not happen. Steven, of course, does not really believe this. The bus driver, angry and cynical, tells Steven the same can happen to Steven's own future. This unsettles Steven. Steven is also growing impatient because he has a long time to wait before Bryony will become a woman. When Steven discovers that Bryony's family is selling their home and moving away he is frantic. Steven sees a psychiatrist on an occasional basis, but he is at odds with advice because he only wants concurrence. The psychiatrist is unable to impress upon Steven that it is the choices we make that determine our future‚Äînot a machine. When Steven discovers that Bryony‚Äôs family is not moving away, he begins working on a plan. Steven tells the bus driver that nothing changes; the future cannot be altered, as proof since Bryony's family will not move away. The bus driver becomes more agitated, believing his marriage is doomed, as predicted. The bus driver goes off, getting very drunk. The bus driver confronts his wife over this predicted affair that only he has viewed. He beats her, pouring petrol down her throat in punishment for a \\"future\\" only he \\"knows.\\" Steven sets his plan in motion to get Bryony alone, but does not touch her. He apologizes and tells her that when they are together it will be wonderful, but only in the future. Steven tells himself that what will happen to him (enforced incarceration in a psychiatric hospital) will put him in place so that he can meet Bryony as a future nurse. Steven is arrested and Bryony‚Äôs parents arrive police station to take her home. The psychiatrist comes to see Steven at the police station. The psychiatrist knows that Steven is not a pedophile, but that Steven uses the illegal time machines and then created a faked attempt upon Bryony to get placed into psychiatric care. Steven begs the psychiatrist to say the right words that will get him confined. The news comes on the television with a report about the attack on the woman at the petrol station. Her employer is now constantly at her bedside while she recovers; the bus driver's future is now completed, as predicted. However, the news also reports that the drunken bus driver has crashed into Bryony‚Äôs parents‚Äô car as they were taking her home from the police station after her Steven confronted her. The psychiatrist, seeing the news, rushes to the police station to see Steven, but Steven is being sent to a facility and the psychiatrist does not tell Steven of the accident with the bus. Steven is taken to psychiatric confinement, satisfied that he has attained the first step he needs to be placed in Bryony‚Äôs future. However, Steven's true love has tragically died in the accident with the bus, caused by the events set in motion by Steven's plan to be with her in his distant future.

Life Rolt was baptized at Shrewsbury, the son of Richard Rolt (died 1739) and Mary Davies. He was educated at Shrewsbury School, at that time under Leonard Hotchkiss. The family was connected to that of Samuel Rolt, Member of Parliament for Bedford. Found a place under an excise officer in the north of England, by John Orlebar, MP and son-in-law of Samuel Rolt, he was suspected of joining the Jacobite army in 1745, and was therefore dismissed from his situation. He then went to Dublin, hoping to obtain employment in Ireland through the influence of his relative on his mother's side Ambrose Philips. Philips returned with Rolt to London in 1748, dying the next year. By then Rolt had been articled to an attorney, and had been introduced to Whig political circles. Writing for a living, Rolt is said to have composed more than a hundred cantatas, songs, and other pieces for Vauxhall Gardens, Sadler's Wells (where he worked with Thomas Rosoman), and the \\"legitimate\\" theatres. He also wrote copiously for periodicals, and acted as an editor. With Christopher Smart, he was employed by Thomas Gardner the bookseller to write a monthly miscellany, The Universal Visiter . Rolt died on 2 March 1770, aged 45. Works With patrons General James Oglethorpe, the Earl of Middlesex, and others, Rolt published Cambria, a Poem in three books (London, 1749), dedicated to Prince George. His Poem ‚Ä¶ to the memory of Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, 3rd Baronet, London, 1749, was well received. He then issued An Impartial Representation of the Conduct of the Several Powers of Europe engaged in the late general War ‚Ä¶ from 1739 ‚Ä¶ to ‚Ä¶ 1748 (4 vols. London, 1749‚Äì50), which Voltaire enjoyed. His Eliza, a new Musical Entertainment ‚Ä¶ the Music composed by Mr. Arne (London, 1754), and Almena, an English Opera ‚Ä¶ the Music composed by Mr. Arne and Mr. Battishill (London, 1764), were successfully produced at Drury Lane Theatre on 20 January 1757, and 2 November 1764 respectively. Another libretto was a translation from Metastasio, The Royal Shepherd (1764), composed by George Rush. Rolt was given a bad reputation for competence, and is called a \\"hack compiler\\". He also published: * The Ancient Rosciad, 1753. * Memoirs of the Life of ‚Ä¶ James Lindesay, Earl of Crawfurd and Lindesay, London, 1753. * A New and Accurate History of South America, London, 1756. * A New Dictionary of Trade and Commerce, London, 1756; 2nd ed. London, 1761. Samuel Johnson wrote the preface. Arthur Murphy commented that Johnson, who had planned a similar work, may have supplied Rolt with material. James Boswell's recorded remark from Johnson, that he did not know Rolt and had not read the book, is not really consistent with that report. Rolt did claim acquaintance with Johnson. * The Lives of the principal reformers, both Englishmen and foreigners, comprehending the general history of the Reformation, from ... 1360 to 1600, London, 1759, with mezzotints by Richard Houston,The Lives of the principal reformers, both Englishmen and foreigners, comprehending the general history of the Reformation, from ... 1360 to 1600, London, Printed for E. Bakewell and H. Parker, 1759. and other works. John Sherratt brought Rolt some writing projects at the end of the 1750s, designed to further his own interests in privateering. Rolt edited from the author's manuscript Travels through Italy (1766), by John Northall. At his death Rolt left manuscripts, brought out by a group of friends: a History of the Isle of Man, which was published in 1773, and The History of the British Dominions in North America in six volumes. Select Pieces of the late R. Rolt was dedicated to Lady Sondes, daughter of Henry Pelham, a sometime patron of Rolt. It was published in 1772 for the benefit of Rolt's widow Mary, n√©e Perrins. Family Rolt was twice married, and left a daughter by each of his wives. His second wife Mary, who survived him many years, was, by her mother, related to the Percys of Worcester.

Organized in Peoria, Illinois, and formed from men entirely within Fulton County, Illinois, the group left Illinois, serving with Sherman through the Atlanta Campaign, March to the Sea and Carolina Campaign. Finally, the regiment participated in the troop review in Washington, D.C., before mustering out in Chicago, and traveling back to their homes. Service The regiment was formed entirely with men from Fulton County, Illinois, and was called up as part of the recruitment drive during the summer and fall of 1862 after a series of Union setbacks. The men were organized and trained in Peoria, Illinois, before being mustered into service on October 2, 1862, with a strength of 804 men. Many of the officers were veterans of early battles in the war; most had come from the 17th Illinois Infantry Regiment. The Adjutant General's Report of 1901 notes that due to the experience of the veteran officers, heavy emphasis was placed on training. Training took place in Peoria for a month before they boarded trains and headed south to Cairo, Illinois The 103rd Illinois was to join Major General Ulysses S. Grant's army in west Tennessee, attached to the XIII Corps. They participated in operations in Tennessee and northern Mississippi in late 1862 and early 1863. With the dawn of 1863 in the war's western front, the emphasis was Vicksburg, Mississippi. The strategy was to completely take control of the Mississippi River, thereby cutting the nation in two; this effectively would eliminate the west to east transportation of troops and supplies from locations like Texas. Starting this new phase, the regiment was attached to the XVI Corps in a brigade commanded by Stephen G. Hicks. While the vast majority of the Army of the Tennessee participated in operations against Vicksburg, the 103rd Illinois remained in La Grange, Tennessee, protecting the Union supply lines into northern Mississippi. In this capacity, they helped provide support from Grierson's Raid in April 1863. By June the regiment was sent to the Yazoo River and temporarily attached the IX Corps. They participated in the fortification of Snyder's Bluff, helping to guard the army's rear from attacks by Confederate forces. After the surrender of Vicksburg on July 4, the 103rd was assigned to the XV Corps under Major General William T. Sherman. They participated in a foray to the Mississippi capital of Jackson and spent the rest of the summer in and around Vicksburg. With the Army of the Cumberland trapped at Chattanooga, Tennessee, Sherman led the XV Corps to their relief. The 103rd left Vicksburg on September 28 traveling north to Memphis, then continuing overland to Chattanooga. They crossed the Tennessee River with the rest of the XV Corps on November 24 and participated in the attack on Goat Hill at the north end of Missionary Ridge. Although the men of the 103rd had been in the army for over a year, this was their first major engagement with the enemy. The next day, November 25, the regiment took part in the assault on Tunnel Hill, Georgia. The Federals endured withering fire from Confederates under Major General Patrick R. Cleburne, who were strongly entrenched on the hill. The men of the 103rd got within a few yards of the enemy breastworks, but the fire from the enemy was so strong they could not break the enemy line and were ordered to withdraw. During their baptism of fire, the regiment lost one officer and twenty-four men killed, and sixty-three men wounded (37% of those engaged). Fortunately for the Federals, the center of the Confederate line on Missionary Ridge collapsed and the battle was won. The 103rd with the rest of Sherman's command continued westward after the Battle of Chattanooga to relieve General Ambrose Burnside, whose army was besieged by Confederate general James Longstreet at Knoxville. Finding that Longstreet had already given up on the siege by the time they arrived in Knoxville, Sherman returned to Chattanooga. During the winter of 1863-1864, the 103rd spent time in winter quarters and guard duty in Cleveland, Tennessee. They rejoined the XV Corps just in time to participate in the Atlanta Campaign beginning on May 3, 1864. They were lightly engaged at the Battle of Resaca on May 14, losing one man killed and several wounded and participated heavily in the Battle of Dallas two weeks later. Among the slain was the regimental commander, Colonel Willard A. Dickerman who was mortally wounded. On June 27 the regiment participated in the disastrous assault on Kennesaw Mountain. Wave after wave of Federal attackers were turned back by Confederates occupying a strongly entrenched position on the mountain. This bloody and futile battle cost the 103rd three officers killed and four wounded, as well as nineteen enlisted men killed and a large number of wounded. By mid-July Sherman's army was at Atlanta and the men of the 103rd endured a massive counterattack by General John Bell Hood's Rebels on July 22. This attack was repulsed and the 103rd took position in the earthworks around Atlanta until August 25 when they were pulled out to participate in the destruction of the Atlanta and West Point Railroad and the Battle of Jonesborough on September 1. Atlanta fell into Union hands the following day. Taking a position six miles south of Atlanta on September 5, a veteran remembered that here they \\"took our first night's rest since May 11 without the rebel guns to lull us to sleep.\\" On November 16 they, along with the rest of the Army of the Tennessee, began the March to the Sea, arriving in Savannah, Georgia, on December 21. In mid-January they started northward to participate in the Carolinas Campaign. The procession through South Carolina culminated with the taking of the capital city of Columbia. A lot of anger with the state that began the stream of the state successions have been reported, however, much of this is due to the writings of Edward Alfred Pollard, particularly The Lost Cause: A New Southern History of the War of the Confederates. A strong sense of pride by southerns wanted to demonstrate the wrongdoings of the north, showing evidence where none existed or was grossly exaggerated. The culmination of the South Carolina battles ended with the burning of Columbia. By the time Sherman's army moved into North Carolina, the mood had swung within both the Union and Confederate armies. General Robert E. Lee had surrendered at Appomattox Courthouse, and the feeling of a northern victory was at hand. Correspondence between Generals William Tecumseh Sherman and Joseph E. Johnston were taking place culminating in the surrender of all Confederate armies at Bennett Place. The 103rd was present for the stacking of arms at Durham Station, North Carolina, on April 26, 1865. After the surrender, the 103rd Illinois, along with the rest of Sherman's Army, marched northward, passing through the former Confederate capital city of Richmond and arriving at Washington City around May 20, 1865. They participated in the Grand Review of the Armies of the armies on May 24, then traveled down the Ohio River to Louisville. Here the regiment was mustered out on June 21 and ordered to Chicago for final pay and discharge.

Babcock was instrumental in the organization and recruitment of a regiment. He and several other influential men of the county, went to the Governor, promising to recruit enough men for a regiment consisting of entirely Fulton County men. When the task seemed to fall short, the Governor offered up two companies of men outside the county. By the deadline, however, the recruitment drive was successful, mustering in ten companies to make up the Regiment.  Colonel Willard A. Dickerman  ::October 18, 1862, to May 28, 1864 Willard A.

Isaac Nathan composed in 1847 an opera about John of Austria History Hugo Alpen composed a gavotte in 1880 for Sydney University Isaac Nathan's 1847 Don John of Austria was the first opera to be written, composed and produced in Australia. The establishment of choral societies (c. 1850) and symphony orchestras (c. 1890) led to increased compositional activity, although most Australian classical composers of this period worked entirely within European models and many undertook their training in composition in Europe or the United Kingdom. One of the earliest known composers was George Tolhurst, whose oratorio Ruth was the first composed in the then colony of Victoria in 1864. Some works leading up to the first part of the 20th century were heavily influenced by folk music (Percy Grainger's \\"English Country Gardens\\" of 1908 being a good example of this). An estimated 10,000 Australians and New Zealanders traveled to Britain each year from the late 1880s to the early 20th century, and the number doubled between the World Wars. A majority was likely female, often a musician; in 1907 one commentator said that Australia's principal exports to Britain were \\"frozen sheep and pretty-voiced girls\\". Success in London was often seen as a prerequisite for fame in Australia for singers such as Nellie Melba, Amy Sherwin, and Ada Crossley. Australian composers who published classical music during the late nineteenth century include Hugo Alpen, Hooper Brewster-Jones, Thomas Bulch, Alice Charbonnet- Kellermann, George H. Clutsam, Herbert De Pinna, John Albert Delany Guglielmo Enrico Lardelli, Louis Lavater, George Marshall-Hall, Stephen Moreno, George William Torrance, Cesare Cutolo, Christian Helleman and Augustus Juncker. Even for composers, a trip abroad could make a career: George Frederick Boyle, who was born in New South Wales in 1886, had a great career in Australia as a piano prodigy but did not meet with international success as a composer until he traveled to Europe and the United States. From the time of Australia's Federation in 1901, a growing sense of national identityAllen & Unwin, Elder, Catriona. Being Australian: Narratives of National Identity, Copyright 2007 began to emerge in the arts, although a patriotic attachment with the \\"mother country\\"As Elder said of this relationship,\\"... a country Australia was obliged to help and which in turn would help Australia.\\" (p. 11)> or \\"Home\\", that is Britain, and the Empire, continued to dominate musical taste. In the war and post-war eras, as the Australian national identity continued to build, composers looked to their surroundings for inspiration. John Antill in his ballet Corroboree, Peter Sculthorpe and others began to incorporate elements of Aboriginal music, Richard Meale drew influence from south-east Asia (notably using the harmonic properties of the Balinese gamelan), while Nigel Butterley combined his penchant for International modernism with an own individual voice. By the beginning of the 1960s other strong influences emerged in Australian classical music, with composers incorporating disparate elements into their work, ranging from Aboriginal and south-east Asian music and instruments, American jazz and blues, to the belated discovery of European atonality and the avante-garde. Composers like Don Banks, Don Kay, Malcolm Williamson and Colin Brumby epitomise this period. Others who adhered to more traditional idioms include Arthur Benjamin, George Dreyfus, Peggy Glanville- Hicks and Robert Hughes. In recent times composers including Julian Cochran, Gordon Hamilton, Liza Lim, Nigel Westlake, David Worrall, Graeme Koehne, Elena Kats-Chernin, Carl Vine, Brett Dean, Martin Wesley-Smith, Georges Lentz, Richard Mills, Ross Edwards, Stephen Leek, Matthew Hindson and Constantine Koukias have embodied the pinnacle of established Australian composers. James Murdoch played a large part in promoting Australian music both at home and internationally, and in bringing Peggy Glanville-Hicks and Richard Meale back from self-imposed artistic exile overseas.

There is a nearby church called Saint Albans Church, but it is in Pauatahanui not Judgeford. BRANZ, the Building Research Association of New Zealand headquarters is at the beginning of Moonshine Road near Judgeford. History In the 1850s, immigrant settlers from England came to Judgeford. Most people farmed, and there were some sawmills. The area was originally called the Small Farms Settlement. The Judgeford School, sometimes called the Small Farms School, opened on 6 October 1879, with 29 children taught by Miss Georgina Chatwin. When it reopened after the 1934 summer holidays there were only 8 children, and the school closed on 10 May 1935 with the remaining pupils following other children in the area to the Pauatahanui School. In 1883 people started to call the suburb Judgeford because of an early settler called Alfred Judge who had built his house close to a river. Hence the name Judge's Ford was created, which soon changed into the name Judgeford. In the 1890s a cooperative dairy business was established at the junction of Flightys Road and the Pauatahanui- Haywards Road by the Abbott and Galloway families. It was primarily a creamery where the milk was separated and the cream sent elsewhere to make butter or cheese, and operated for about 15 years until it burnt down in 1907. In World War II the US Marines had four camps in the Pauatahanui area; the Judgeford camp accommodated 3,755 men. Population At the 2013 census, 1080 people lived in the Pauatahanui area unit, which includes Judgeford.

Fearnet called the film \\"a sweet little winner\\" with inexperienced but committed actors. Variety gave a mostly positive review, saying that although the performances were uneven overall, the movie was \\"surprisingly appealing\\" and was a \\"micro-budget horror-comedy tailor-made for teen geeks who are sufficiently self-aware to laugh at themselves\\". DVD Talk expressed admiration at what the then 17-year- old Hagins was able to do with the film and said that while the movie was \\"hit and miss throughout\\" it was \\"worth seeing for its heart and soul and creativity\\". Dread Central panned My Sucky Teen Romance overall, giving it two out of five blades and said that \\"While Hagins shows that she‚Äôs becoming more than capable behind the camera, she still needs a bit of work at honing her abilities as a screenwriter.\\" Screen Daily wrote, \\"Hagins‚Äô youth is obviously exploitable in publicity terms, but the film has winning qualities which would be impressive in any low-budget movie.\\" In a mixed review, Pop Matters criticized the film's dialog but wrote that the film \\"has its moments\\" and is \\"admirably sincere\\".

This will be the Green Wave's first New Orleans Bowl, as well as their first bowl game of any kind since the 2002 Hawaii Bowl, which saw them defeat the Hawaii Warriors by a score of 36‚Äì28 at Aloha Stadium. It will also be the Green Wave's final game as a member of Conference USA before moving to the American Athletic Conference for 2014, as well as their final game in the Superdome before moving to the on-campus Yulman Stadium for 2014. =Offense= Second-year head coach Curtis Johnson led the Green Wave into the game with a statistically lackluster offense that ranked near the bottom of the Football Bowl Subdivision in passing yards, averaging only 176.1 per game, rushing yards, averaging only 128.1 per game, and points scored, averaging only 25.1 per game. Their mediocre passing game was led by Nick Montana, the son of NFL-great Joe Montana, who played his redshirt freshman and freshman season at University of Washington and his sophomore season at Mt. San Antonio College before transferring to Tulane, at which he was named the team's starter over Devin Powell, who played during the season when Montana sustained a separated right shoulder in October, prior to the season's first game. The two-pronged rushing game included senior running back Orleans Darkwa, who rushed for 780 yards and 9 touchdowns during the regular season, and junior running back Rob Kelley, who rushed for 422 yards and 3 touchdowns during the regular season. Ryan Grant, who was on the preseason Biletnikoff Award watchlist, saw his 2013 season numbers decline from 2012, but still managed to record 70 receptions, 926 yards, and 9 touchdowns, highlighted by a 14-reception, 187-yard, 2-touchdown performance in the Green Wave's second game, a loss at the hands of South Alabama. Other prominent receivers included junior wideout Justyn Shackleford (34 regular season receptions), and sophomore wideout Xavier Rush, freshman wideout Kedrick Banks, and Kelley, the latter three of whom each recorded 17 regular season receptions. Sophomore tight end Sydie London was not much of a threat in the passing game (12 receptions in 12 games), but he was one of just two tight ends on the roster, so was almost a starter by default, though at one spring practice, did impress New Orleans Saints wide receiver Marques Colston, who thought he was one of the best players on the team. Tulane's offensive line was a much maligned group throughout the season. By the end of the season, they were ravaged by injury, and hindered both the running and passing games. The 2012 winner of the Lou Groza Award, senior kicker Cairo Santos, handled the kicking for the Green Wave, but regressed from being a perfect 21/21 to going 16/22, though he did have a long of 56 yards. =Defense= Tulane's defense, which featured a 3‚Äì4 defensive scheme, fared better during the regular season than the offense. They ranked 22nd in the nation in scoring defense, surrendering only 21.2 points per game. They allowed 354.3 yards per game; of that 234.3 was in the passing game and 120 in the running game. The defensive line was anchored by Royce LaFrance, who recorded 6.5 sacks, tied for third in Conference USA. The other defensive end slot was occupied by Julius Warmsley, who recorded 41 tackles, and 4 sacks. The duo helped provide consistent pressure on opposing quarterbacks. Supplementing the ends' pass rush was reserve end Tyler Gilbert, who added three sacks. Augmenting the defensive ends was defensive tackle Chris Davenport (15 tackles, 1.5 sacks), who transferred from LSU prior to the season. Tulane also had a veteran core of linebackers, comprising seniors Zach Davis, who led the corps with 78 tackles, Darryl Farley, who recorded 62 tackles, as well as contributors senior Kyle Davis, freshman Nico Marley, and junior Taylor Bullock. The defensive backs also contributed to the team's defensive success, with Lorenzo Doss recording seven interceptions, tied for the best in the conference. Safety Darion Monroe led the entire defense in tackles, with 96; he also recovered three fumbles during the season. Derrick Strozier and Jordan Sullen also contributed at cornerback, recording two interceptions apiece, as did Ryan Travis, who was fourth on the team with 53 tackles. Jordan Batiste played a roving position in the secondary, but was a major contributor, as were Sam Scofield, a cornerback, and Shakiel Smith, a safety. Louisiana‚ÄìLafayette Ragin' Cajuns The Ragin' Cajuns continued their recent winning ways in 2013, clinching at least a share of the Sun Belt Conference championship once again with a 5‚Äì1 conference and an 8‚Äì3 overall record. After losing to the Louisiana‚ÄìMonroe Warhawks for only the team's third loss of the season (and first in-conference), bowl director Billy Ferrante extended an invitation to play in the game. This will be the Ragin' Cajuns third consecutive New Orleans Bowl, having won the previous two; the first being in 2011 where they defeated the San Diego State Aztecs by a score of 32‚Äì30, and the second being in 2012 where they defeated the East Carolina Pirates by a score of 43‚Äì34. The Ragin' Cajuns are only the second team to play in three consecutive New Orleans Bowls, joining the North Texas Mean Green who participated in the first four editions of the game, finishing with a 1‚Äì3 record. The Ragin' Cajuns began their season on a two-game losing streak, then won eight consecutive games, and then lost their final two. =Offense= The Ragin' Cajuns' spread offense attack was coordinated by Jay Johnson. Junior Terrance Broadway played quarterback, and finished the regular season fifth in the Sun Belt in passing yards with 2276, third in passing touchdowns with 19, and led the conference with a 157.0 passer rating. Late in the season, Broadway broke his right throwing arm, and subsequently underwent surgery, however coach Mark Hudspeth was \\"optimistic\\" he would return for the bowl game. Freshman Brooks Haack was the backup. A pair of backs led a \\"solid running back tandem\\" that Ragin' Cajuns' rushing attack ‚Äì junior Alonzo Harris and freshman Elijah McGuire each exceeded 800 rushing yards, however McGuire did so averaging 8.9 yards per carry, whereas Harris averaged 4.7 yards per carry (Harris had 186 carries to McGuire's 92). Broadway also contributed to the rushing attack, attaining 421 yards on 117 carries. Harris had 13 touchdowns, McGuire had 7, and Broadway had 8. A trio of wide receivers anchored the Louisiana-Lafayette receiving game. junior Jamal Robinson was by far Broadway's favorite target, leading the team with 50 receptions, 812 yards, and 8 touchdowns, senior Darryl Surgent was second on the team with 29 receptions, 398 yards, and 5 touchdowns, and junior James Butler was third on the team 26 receptions and 363 yards, however he had only one touchdown. Senior Jacob Maxwell started at tight end, and reeled in 12 passes for 158 yards and 2 touchdowns on the season. McGuire and fellow running back sophomore Effrem Reed also contributed in the receiving game. Junior college transfer Stephen Brauchle, who began his college career at Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College, teamed with walk-on holder Jake Guidry to handle the kicking duties for the Ragin' Cajuns; he made 8 of 13 field goal attempts with a long of 38 yards, and was 51 of 53 on extra point attempts. The offensive line was composed of brothers Daniel and Mykhael Quave, who started at right guard and left tackle respectively (Mykhael transitioned to tackle after playing at guard his freshman season), senior center Andre Huval, sophomore right tackle Octravian Anderson, and junior left guard Terry Johnson. =Defense= The Ragin' Cajuns defense, led by new coordinator James Willis, was led by one of \\"the league's best linebackers\\", Justin Anderson, who recorded a team-leading 123 total tackles, and 10 TFL, second on the team. Joining him in the linebacking corps was undersized ( ) sophomore Chris Hill, whose 37 tackles were eighth on the team, but who sustained an injury late in the season and was questionable for the bowl game, junior Darius Barksdale, who played in only seven games, and recorded 28 total tackles, sophomore Dominque Tovell, who though listed as a defensive end, played linebacker, and finished second on the team with 64 tackles, and led the team with 12 TFL. Much to his shock, even freshman safety Al Riles saw time at linebacker due to injury depletion by the end of the season. On the defensive line, junior Justin Hamilton started at nose tackle, and totaled 37 tackles, 8 TFL, and 3 sacks, junior Christian Ringo was the predominant starter at defensive end, totaling 15 tackles, 2 TFL, and 1 sack, and senior defensive tackle Brandon McCray, who totaled 13 tackles and 2 TFL. In the secondary, Trevence Patt achieved second team all-conference recognition, totaling 41 tackles. Other starters included Corey Trim, T. J. Worthy, and Sean Thomas. Game summary First quarter Tulane received the opening kickoff, and went three-and-out. Louisiana-Lafayette (ULL) took the field with Terrance Broadway at quarterback (there was question due to his injury as to whether he would start), however they rotated him with Jalen Nixon, but it was Broadway who was in the game when Elijah McGuire rushed for a 27-yard touchdown, ruled such after video review. After Nick Montana started the first drive, redshirt freshman Devin Powell entered the game on Tulane's second drive, but failed to have any success, for another three-and-out. Tulane's defense got a stop on their next drive, highlighted by Nico Marley (grandson of Bob Marley) recording a tackle for loss on third and short, forcing a punt. Montana returned for Tulane on their next drive, during which they achieved their first first down of the game. However, later in the drive, on an end around wide receiver pass, Ryan Grant's pass intended for Justyn Shackleford was intercepted, setting up the Ragin Cajuns for an offensive drive during which they drove down the field, taking advantage of a personal foul late hit that put them in the red zone and subsequently allowed Alonzo Harris to rush for a 15-yard touchdown, the final score of the first quarter. Second quarter Early in the second quarter, while in the red zone, Montana threw an interception to Corey Trim, who returned it for an 82-yard touchdown, giving ULL a 21‚Äì0 lead. Devin Powell subsequently replaced Montana. After each team went three-and-out, Tulane scored its first points, a 1-yard touchdown run by Orleans Darkwa that culminated a 9-play, 71 yard drive that encapsulated 4:43. ULL got the ball back, however Broadway threw an interception, setting up Tulane. On their first play, Powell threw a 49-yard pass to Ryan Grant who, amidst double coverage and despite a pass interference penalty, leaped and made the catch. After a pass interference penalty, Darkwa ran for a 7-yard touchdown, pulling the Green Wave within seven points. Not wanting to turn the ball over, the Ragin' Cajuns rushed on each play of their drive to get into the half, at which the score was 21‚Äì14, Louisiana-Lafayette. Third quarter The teams exchanged punts to start the half. On Louisiana- Lafayette's second drive, Tulane lost tackle Chris Davenport and cornerback Lorenzo Doss to injury; both went to the locker room. Nevertheless, Tulane's defense forced another punt, but their offense failed to capitalize, burning a timeout, and punting back to the Ragin' Cajuns. Tulane's defense sustained another injury on ULL's next drive; senior defensive back Jordan Sullen was carted off the field after being kicked in the head during the course of the run on a screen pass that converted a second-and-long; he left the field on a backboard, however he stood up and hobbled to the backboard, thus alleviating concern of paralysis, which had happened to Tulane the previous season. Sullen was transported to Tulane Medical Center as a precaution, however was expected to make a full recovery. Meanwhile, Doss returned to the game, and on the next play, Broadway threw an interception to cornerback Derrick Strozier, setting up Tulane in the red zone; they scored via a Darkwa touchdown run on the first play of their ensuing drive, tying the game at 21. ULL again failed to execute offensively, and went three-and-out. At the end of the third quarter, the game was tied at 21. Fourth quarter Louisiana-Lafayette stopped Tulane's offensive momentum early in the quarter, forcing a punt. On ULL's ensuing drive, they were faced with a third down a six, and threw an incomplete pass, however a pass interference call gave them a first down, which energized the Ragin' Cajuns temporarily, but they ultimately punted, pinning Tulane inside the five yard line, from which, while under pressure, Powell threw the ball up in the air, and it was intercepted, setting ULL up with excellent field position, particularly when they went half the distance to the goal after a dead ball personal foul penalty on Tulane. ULL had an opportunity to score a touchdown, however after Broadway slipped during a run while in the open field on third down, ultimately going down due to cramps, and forcing Hunter Stover, a linebacker turned place kicker, attempted his first-ever college field goal, a 27-yard kick that he made, stopping Tulane's streak of 21 unanswered points. Tulane subsequently took the field and converted a first down, and failed to convert a third down at the 40-yard line, after which they decided to punt rather than test Santos's field goal range. Jalen Nixon took the field at quarterback on ULL's drive after Broadway went to the locker room for fluids. On back-to-back runs, Harris rushed for a first down, and then Nixon rushed for a first down, giving the Ragin' Cajuns momentum prior to beginning to try to work the clock. Faced with a third and ten and under duress, Nixon found an open receiver to convert the third down. Later in the drive, Strozier went down due to cramps, exiting the game. With 1:42, ULL was forced to punt after Scofield made an open field tackle to keep ULL out of field goal range, after which coach Curtis Johnson called timeout. Tulane got the ball at the five- yard line with 1:35 and one timeout to try to start a drive to tie or win the game, however after Powell threw two incomplete passes at the ground, they were faced with a third and long; Powell escaped pressure in the end zone, and ultimately threw the ball up in the air and Shackleford reeled it in for a first down out to around the 40-yard line. Two plays later, Powell threw a 27-yard pass to Grant, putting Tulane in Santos's field goal range. With 24 seconds and a timeout, Tulane had the ball at the 25-yard line, but Powell took a sack at the 31-yard line, forcing Tulane to burn their final timeout with 13 seconds left. Santos subsequently came out to try a 48-yard field goal, but ULL tried to ice him by calling a timeout; after the timeout, Santos missed the field goal wide, winning the game for ULL.

(The term \\"suntukan\\" however is most commonly known in the Philippines to simply mean punching or boxing). In the central Philippine island region of Visayas, it is known as Pangamot or Pakamot. It is also known as Mano-mano and often referred to in Western martial arts circles of Inosanto lineage as Panantukan. Although it is also called Filipino Boxing, this article pertains to the Filipino martial art and should not be confused with the Western sport of boxing as practiced in the Philippines.  Etymology  The term suntukan comes from the Tagalog word for punch, suntok. It is the Filipino term for a fistfight or brawl and for fist fighting or boxing. Panununtukan means \\"the art of fistfighting\\". The Visayan terms pangamot and pakamot (\\"use of hands\\") come from the Cebuano word for hand, kamot. Due to Cebuano language pronunciation quirks, they are also pronounced natively as pangamut and pakamut, thus the variation of spelling across literature. Mano-mano comes from the Spanish word for \\"hand\\", mano, and can translate to \\"two hands\\" or \\"hand-to-hand\\". The phrase \\"Mano-mano na lang, o?\\" (\\"Why don't we settle this with fists?\\") is often used to end arguments when tempers have flared in Philippine male society. Panantukan (often erroneously referred to as panantuken by USA practitioners due to the way Americans pronounce the letters U and A) is a contraction of the Tagalog term pananantukan, according to Dan Inosanto.Interview with Dan Inosanto by Daniel Sullivan It is generally attributed to the empty hands and boxing system infused by FMA pioneers Juan \\"Johnny\\" Lacoste, Leodoro \\"Lucky\\" Lucaylucay and Floro Villabrille into the Filipino martial arts component of the Inosanto Academy and Jeet Kune Do fighting systems developed in the West Coast of the United States. Pananantukan, which Inosanto picked up from his Visayan elder instructors, is a corruption of panununtukan. While the Tagalog of his instructors was not perfect (Lacoste was Waray and the Filipino language based on Tagalog was relatively new when they migrated to the United States), they were highly versed in Filipino martial arts. It is said that originally, Lucaylucay wanted to call his art Suntukan, but he was concerned that it would be confused with Shotokan Karate, so he used the term Panantukan instead. The terms panantukan and its sibling component pananjakman (for the kicking aspect - possibly a corruption of panadiyakan or pananadiyakan) are virtually unknown in the Philippines and are used more in Western Kali/Eskrima systems of Filipino- American origin. Dirty Boxing is a contemporary westernized term used by a few instructors to describe suntukan. The term is also widely used in MMA for clinch fighting, specifically for punching in the clinch.  Characteristics  Suntukang Kalye (dirty street boxing) with locks, trips, knees, throws and elbows Suntukan is not a sport, but rather a street-oriented fighting system. The techniques have not been adapted for safety or conformance to a set of rules for competition, thus it has a reputation as \\"dirty street fighting\\". It consists of upper-body striking techniques such as punches, elbows, headbutts, shoulder strikes and limb destruction. It is often used in combination with Sikaran, the kicking aspect of Filipino fighting which includes low-line kicks, tripping and knee strikes to the legs, shins, and groin. Common targets include the biceps, triceps, eyes, nose, jaws, temples, groin, ribs, spine, and the back of the neck. Weaponry Even though suntukan is designed to allow an unarmed practitioner to engage in both armed and unarmed confrontations, it easily integrates the use of weapons such as knives, palmsticks (dulo y dulo) and ice picks. These weapons can render suntukan's techniques fatal but do not fundamentally change how the techniques are executed. Weapons in suntukan tend to be small, easily concealed and unobtrusive. Thus, suntukan minimizes contact with the opponent because it is not always known whether an opponent is armed, and knives are very often used in fights and brawls in the Philippines. As such, parries and deflections are preferred over blocks and prolonged grappling.  Arnis/Eskrima/Kali  Suntukan is also a key component of Arnis. It is theorized to have evolved from Filipino weapons fighting because in warfare, unarmed fighting is usually a method of last resort for when combatants are too close in proximity (such as trapping and grappling range) or have lost their weapons. Aside from this, some unarmed techniques and movements in certain Eskrima systems are directly derived from their own weapon-based forms. In some classical Eskrima systems, the terms Mano mano, De Cadena (Spanish for \\"of chain\\") and Cadena de Mano (Spanish for \\"hand chain\\") are the names for their empty hand components. Aside from punching, the suntukan components in Eskrima includes kicking, locking, throwing and dumog (grappling). In Western boxing A number of Filipino boxing champions have practiced eskrima and panantukan. While many Filipino boxing champions such as Estaneslao \\"Tanny\\" del Campo and Buenaventura \\"Kid Bentura\\" Lucaylucay (Lucky Lucaylucay's father) practiced Olympic and sport boxing, they also used pangamot dirty street boxing which is distinct from western boxing. A particular trait of Filipino boxing (as opposed to Western boxing) is that instead of standing and trading blows with an opponent, suntukan practitioners typically circle constantly to avoid getting hit and look for openings, just like with knife fighting. According to Lucky Lucaylucay: \\"...if your practice is based on knife fighting, you have to become much more sophisticated with your footwork, evasions and delivery because one wrong move could mean death... ...Filipino boxing is exactly like knife fighting, except instead of cutting with a blade, we strike with a closed fist.\\" World champion Ceferino Garcia (regarded as having introduced the bolo punch to the Western world of boxing) wielded a bolo knife in his youth and developed his signature punch from his experience in cutting sugarcane in farm fields with the bladed implement, and his time as a street fighter. Legendary world champion Gabriel \\"Flash\\" Elorde studied Balintawak Eskrima (under founder Venancio \\"Anciong\\" Bacon) and got his innovative, intricate footwork from his father, \\"Tatang\\" Elorde who was the Eskrima champion of Cebu. Elorde's footwork from eskrima has been adopted by many boxers, including his friend Muhammad Ali. Image: semi-crochet2.jpg A left bolo punch in attack Image: Contre_bolo1.jpg A left bolo punch in counterpunch Techniques Panantukan dirty fighting techniques  Speed, flow, and rhythm  Suntukan emphasizes speed in striking, with the intent of overwhelming the adversary with a flurry of attacks. Indefinite combinations of different strikes are strung together continuously to make successful defense a relative impossibility. Many strikes in suntukan are said to be performed on \\"half-beats\\", or in between the major strikes of a combination, so as to disorient and overwhelm an opponent, increasing the opportunity for more devastating attacks. An example of this could be performing a swift slap or eye strike after throwing a jab with the same hand in a standard jab-cross- hook combination; the eye strike both disrupts the defense against and masks the incoming cross. Sometimes, low-line kicks are often executed between boxing combinations to further injure and disorient the opponent.  Angles  The angles outlined in eskrima are incorporated to evade and parry incoming strikes and to attack the opponent from an outside angle where they are less able to defend themselves. Constantly switching the fighting lead allows for the exploitation of attack while maintaining flow. The fighter will often use a finishing strike or kick in a combination to step into the new lead. Footwork is of utmost importance for these techniques, so in some systems, much time is invested into practicing stick-fighting drills and combinations.  Gunting  Some moves which immobilise the limbs are called gunting (scissors) techniques because of the scissor-like motions used to stop an opponent's limb from one side while attacking from the other side. Suntukan focuses on countering an opponent's strike with a technique that will nullify further attack by hitting certain nerve points, bones, and muscle tissue to cause immediate partial paralysis of the attacking limb. Common limb destructions include guiding incoming straight punches into the defending fighter's elbow (siko) to shatter the knuckles, or striking the incoming limb in the biceps to inhibit the opponent's ability to use that arm for the remainder of the fight. Gunting focuses on destroying the opponent's ability to wield their weapon. This term derives from the word \\"scissors\\" in Filipino, Malaysian and Indonesian. In Filipino martial arts, gunting can be done by cutting the hand or wrist with a pair of blades (hence the name), but it can also be done with a single blade or with the empty hand by striking nerves and tensed muscles. Dumog Suntukan also borrows moves from dumog (upright wrestling). Dumog is based on the concept of ‚Äúcontrol points‚Äù or ‚Äúchoke points‚Äù on the human body, which are manipulated ‚Äì for example: by grabbing, pushing, pulling - in order to disrupt the opponent‚Äôs balance and to keep him off balance. This also creates opportunities for close quarter striking using head butts, knees, forearms and elbows. This is accomplished by the use of arm wrenching, shoving, shoulder ramming, and other off-balancing techniques in conjunction with punches and kicks. For example, the attacker's arm could be grabbed and pulled downward to expose their head to a knee strike.

A long-serving Marine officer prior to joining the Fleet, Maxwell arrived in the colony and served there for some 6 months but was incapacitated by a combination of dysentery and a disease of the optic nerves. He was invalided back to England in July 1788 and died in Stonehouse, Plymouth in 1792.  Military service  Maxwell joined the Plymouth Company of the British Marines and was commissioned 2nd lieutenant of the 36th Company on 16 February 1776. He was promoted to 1st lieutenant of 94th (Plymouth) two years later, on 11 April 1778 (per Adm 192/3 p12).Moore 1987, p. 298 Voyage to Australia The NSW Marines were established in late 1786 to preserve \\"subordination and regularity\\" in the proposed penal colony in Botany Bay, AustraliaCorrespondence from Lord Sydney to the Lords Commissioners of Treasury, 18 August 1786. Cited in Britton 1978, p. 14 In March 1787 Marine 1st Lieut Jas Maxwell was disembarked from HMS Rose as a late replacement on the transport Scarborough for NSW Marine Lieut Jas Morrison who had repeatedly absented himself from duty without permission (per Letter from Secretary Stephens to Lieut-Gen Smith of the Admiralty office 26 Mar 1787). According to John Moore's book \\"The First Fleet Marines: 1786-1792\\" Maxwell embarked for Australia aboard First Fleet convict transport Lady Penrhyn on 12 May 1787., however this is an error, as colonial documentation places him departing on Scarborough. As the oldest lieutenant and the longest serving at that rank, he was listed first among his peers in the returns of Marine officers aboard the Fleet.Return by Major Robert Ross, Commanding officer, NSW Marine Corps, 20 May 1787. Cited in Britton 1978, p.106 During the voyage to Botany Bay Maxwell was transferred first to Prince of Wales then on 19 October 1787 to Charlotte. In the Journal of Ralph Clarke, Maxwell was recorded on Prince of Wales, 3 September \\"Then ther is old Maxwell who is drinking himself to death as fast as he well can...\\" It was not long after this that Maxwell was ordered aboard Charlotte in exchange for Lieutenant John Creswell of 64th (Plymouth). The voyage posed difficulties for Maxwell in enforcing discipline among the Marines. On 24 June 1787 he was aboard the transport ship Prince of Wales when he was greeted with insolence and disobedience by Marine privates Arthur Dougherty and Robert Ryan. Maxwell had both men arrested and taken to Fleet flagship . A court martial was convened on the following day; it acquitted Dougherty but sentenced Ryan to 300 lashes, delivered immediately.Moore 1987, p. 55 Two weeks later, Maxwell arrested Marine Sergeant John Kennedy from Prince of Wales, who was so drunk on duty that he fell through an open hatchway and injured the wife of another Marine. Kennedy was held in legcuffs for three weeks, then court martialled and transferred to the Alexander - a hardship post as that vessel suffered from fever, overcrowding and an overflowing bilge.Moore 1987, p.60Hill 2009, p.104 In July 1788 Maxwell requested his return to England due to problems with eyesight. Along with 2nd Lieut Wm Collins, Maxwell was invalided home to England from Port Jackson on Alexander 14 Jul 1788.(per Letters to Secretary Stephens, 9 Jul 1788 - HR NSW Vol II p144-5, 194) There is some conjecture over the death of Maxwell. On one hand there is a confused Obituary of a Jas Maxwell who died on 2 March 1792 at the Marine barracks Stonehouse, Plymouth which contains details of both the Jas Maxwell who served as a Lieutenant for 9 years in HM Marine forces and \\"assisted in the forming of the settlement established at Botany Bay\\", but also information on a Maxwell who had twice circumnavigated the globe with Captain Cook. There was no Marine Maxwell on Cook's voyages but there was an Able Seaman Maxwell on the 2nd voyage. On the other hand, a Marine Lieut James Maxwell was promoted Captain on 1 March 1797, and subsequently reduced to half pay on 1 July 1803 (per Adm 192/4 p52). It's likely that the latter is a similarly named Marine and the Jas Maxwell who died in Stonehouse is the correct one, as Maxwell's record doesn't appear to indicate suitability for promotion to Captain. The will of Maxwell was proved to a brother Richard, \\"Gentleman\\" of Dublin, indicating Jas Maxwell was possibly also born in Dublin.

Unlike her prior feature-length films, Grow Up, Tony Phillips does not feature any supernatural elements seen in past films such as Pathogen or My Sucky Teen Romance.

While writing the script, Hagins wanted to focus on the transition between adult and child that occurs with Halloween, which she felt was often overlooked in many films. The script was a departure the genre from her previous films, as the dark tones depressed her and Hagins wanted to \\"a movie that had no genre at all\\". In 2012 AJ Bowen was confirmed to be performing in the film. Filming began in mid-November 2012 in Austin, Texas. Hagins experienced some difficulty with shooting, as some businesses already had Christmas decorations up but decided to work them into the script as a plot point. Reception Critical reception for Grow Up, Tony Phillips was mostly positive. Common criticisms revolved around the film's storytelling, as some reviewers such as Film School Rejects felt that there were \\"some serious story elements that are left dangling in all but the most superficial ways\\", which interfered with a film that they otherwise enjoyed. Hagins received praise for the film's acting and for what the Daily Texan saw as \\"genuine truths about how high school can dissolve the most intense friendships\\".

It lives permanently underground in the Chiricahua Mountains in Arizona and forms a mutualistic association with the mealybug Rhizoecus colombiensis. Description Head of worker Acropyga epedana is a tiny pale golden-brown ant with a few erect hairs but many dense appressed hairs. The reproductives have normal compound eyes but the workers have tiny eyes and avoid exposure to light. These ants are very similar in appearance to Acropyga goeldii and Acropyga palaga and may be a northern population of A. goeldi. However, there are differences in the extensions to the penis valves that make it likely that the three are in fact separate species. The head of Acropyga epedana is smaller than that of the other two species. The total length of a worker is . Distribution Acropyga epedana is found in the Chiricahua Mountains in Arizona at elevations of between and its range probably extends southwards into the Sierra Madre Occidental Mountains in Mexico. Because there is no sign of the nest above ground, this ant may be under recorded. It is generally found in woodland of juniper and oak. Biology Colonies of Acropyga epedana are completely subterranean. Nests have been found under boulders and consist of galleries and chambers that may extend to or more underground, and perhaps deeper in the dry season. This species has an obligate trophobiotic relationship with the mealybug, Rhizoecus colombiensis. This underground sap-sucking insect feeds on the roots of plants and the ants herd them and feed on the honeydew they produce. The ants are believed to obtain all their nourishment from this source, and in a laboratory experiment, when they were deprived of their mealybugs, they refused all other forms of food that they were offered. The mealybugs are found clustered on roots in deeper parts of the nest in the passages excavated by the ants. Many of the ants are infested with parasitic mites. Flights of winged reproductive ants (alates) have been seen in mid- summer, shortly after the beginning of seasonal rains. There are often ten times as many male as female alates. Each female emerges from her natal nest carrying a mealybug between her mandibles, presumably to act as a parent of the mealybug herd in the nest she will found. The flying ants hover in a swarm and copulate in mid-air. The females return to the ground after their nuptial flights, each still carrying a mealybug, shed their wings, and search for a suitable site to make a new nest. Some may join colonies in existing nests, as evidenced by the fact that there are often several queens in a nest.

Minori and her brother met Shiroe on their first day playing Elder Tale and asked him questions about gaining skills and healing spells. Although Shiroe disliked when people ask him for things, after meeting them he decided to teach them about the game and even lowered his avatar's stats so he could travel with them safely. Minori and her brother were with Shiroe when the Apocalypse began and were separated from Shiroe afterwards. Lost and without anyone to guide them, she and her brother decided to join the guild Hamelin to try to gain experience and levels, but the Hamelin guild masters exploited them (and other low level players) instead. After being rescued, Minori and her brother join Log Horizon and she starts studying Elder Tale's game mechanics under Shiroe, in order to become a strategist like him, but later realizes that she is in love with him, just like Akatsuki; both often compete for Shiroe's affection. Her original secondary class is \\"Tailor\\" but she later switches it to \\"Apprentice\\", allowing her to become Shiroe's official disciple and learn some of his skills as well. ; : :Isuzu is a high school girl who started to play Elder Tale around the time when the Apocalypse happened. She is a bard, using her songs to increase her and her allies' stats and cast debuffs at groups of enemies. She first appears as one of the exploited players by Hamelin, often seen comforting Minori, and then later during the summer camp and becomes a close friend of Rundelhaus Code and is the first to learn that he is one of the People of the Land. She later joins Log Horizon with him. ; : :Rundelhaus Code is one of the People of the Land who pretended to be an Adventurer, despite not having the ability to be resurrected upon death like true player characters. He is a Sorcerer specialized in offensive magic. After being mortally wounded, he signs a contract with Shiroe who uses a new type of magic invented by him to save his life and give him the secondary class \\"Adventurer\\". He joins Log Horizon with Isuzu. ; : :Tetra is a level 90 Cleric. A former resident of Minami, one of the players cities in Yamato, and member of Light Indigo, she was sent by Kazuhiko to aid Shiroe at Susukino. Upon completion of the mission, she asks Shiroe to join Log Horizon and was accepted. Tetra often teases and flirts with Naotsugu for kicks and only a few are aware of the fact that she is actually male, but with a female avatar. = Crescent Moon Alliance = ; : :Marielle, the rather eccentric guild master of the Crescent Moon Alliance guild (which is also part of the Round Table council as the representative of lesser guilds in Akiba) and a friend of Shiroe's, is a Cleric. Her real name is '. She is stronger than she looks and has a habit of hugging people so hard she slams them into walls. She usually does this when meeting new people or greeting a friend, and her preferred victim is Naotsugu with whom she is infatuated. However, she can be very serious when required. This holds true especially when a member of her guild is in danger. ; : :Henrietta is a Bard and one of the leaders of the Crescent Moon Alliance. Although she seems stern and put together, she can be just as eccentric as Marielle when she sees something cute, as becomes evident when she meets Akatsuki. She dislikes it when Marielle calls her by her real name \\"Umeko\\". She is an accountant and MBA in real life and is a great asset to Shiroe's plans due to her ability to negotiate with others. It is not known whether her skills at cosplay in Log Horizon have carried over from the old world. Working closely with Shiroe eventually leads to Henrietta developing a romantic interest in him. ; : :A young Druid of the Crescent Moon Alliance. She is level 19 when first introduced, with a secondary class of Maid, which she often regrets choosing because it only helps her to perform housekeeping chores. She develops a crush on Nyanta after he saves her and keeps her hidden from her enemies. This leads Shiroe and Naotsugu to wonder if she has a fetish for older (middle-aged?) men. Although not a member of Log Horizon, she visits them often partly due to her crush, as well as being a regular member of Tohya and Minori's party. ; : :A Level 90 swashbuckler and member of the Crescent Moon Alliance. He is in love with Marielle and goes to great lengths to try to impress her. He also becomes something of an older brother figure to the low level players who joined the guild after being rescued from Hamelin.

Originally he was opposed to the Round Table Alliance but he was forced to join after D.D.D. and most of the other guilds joined in. Despite having an abrasive personality, he does show understanding and some compassion when he puts his pride aside. ; : = Honesty = ; : :Guild master of Honesty, one of the members of the Round Table council. ; : = West Wind Brigade = While having a much smaller size compared to most other members of the Round Table Council, West Wind Brigade is known for having one of the best combating squad in Akiba. The essence of the guild however, is in fact a fan club of Seta, with members consisting almost entirely of the female admirers of Seta besides himself. ; : :Guild master of the West Wind Brigade and one of the members of the Round Table Council. Former member of Debauchery Tea Party. When introduced after the Apocalypse, he was slightly wary of Shiroe as the latter rejected his offer to join the West Wind Brigade, mistaking it as a sign that Shiroe did not like him (this was quickly cleared up). He is a Lv.90 Samurai and threw his full support behind Shiroe before the conference as he was used to 'fighting from the front'. He is also exceptionally popular with women. ; : :Sub-Guildmaster of West Wind Brigade, and a former member of Debauchery Tea Party. ; : ; : ; : ; : :A trans-gender man who is a member of the West Wind Brigade. ; : ; : = Marine Agency = ; : :Guild master of Marine Agency, one of the members of the Round Table council. ; : = Roderic Merchant Guild = ; : :Guild master of the Roderic Merchant Guild, one of the members of the Round Table council. ; : = Shopping Street 8 = ; : :Guild master of Shopping Street 8, one of the members of the Round Table council. ; : = Grandeur = ; : :Guild master of Grandeur, one of the members of the Round Table council. = Radio Market = ; : :Guild master of Radio Market, one of the members of the Round Table council. = Others = ; : :She owns a weapons store in Akiba.  Minami  Minami is a player city in the Japanese server. Its position is akin to the real world's Osaka. It is ruled by a single guild - Plant Hwyaden. = Plant Hwyaden = ; : :Guild mistress and first seat of Plant Hwyaden, Nureha is a level 90 Fox Tail Enchanter who knew Shiroe before the Apocalypse and has an obsessive infatuation with him. In the real world, she was an abused high school girl who participated in compensated dating to make ends meet, and played Elder Tale to escape from her miserable life. Nureha brought the entirety of Minami after the Apocalypse and ruled it with an iron fist, forcing the players into joining her guild as she also bought the cathedral so that she can permanently kill players who speak out against her. Nureha also became an influence within the Westelande Empire, overseeing Malves's actions. ; : :Former member of the Debauchery Tea Party and the true leader of Plant Hwyaden. Her former admiration for Kanami turned into hate after her abrupt departure which was also the reason behind the disbandment of the party, and now she allied Nureha striving to tear apart the former members of the party to spite Kanami. During her Tea Party days, she was called Kuina; after the disbandment, she made a new account under the name Intics. :The second seat in Plant Hwyaden, personal maid to Nureha, and the de facto leader of Minami due to Nureha not actually caring about the operation of the Guild. She actually gets the upper hand on Nureha, manipulating her by threatening to tell Shiroe about her past if she does not comply. In Episode 14 of Season 2, she told Nureha that her ultimate vision for Planet Hwyaden was world domination. :While no longer being friendly with former party members, she seem to hold an exceptional dislike towards Shiroe even back in those days. ; : :A level 90 Assassin, Kazuhiko is another former Debauchery Tea Party member who traveled to Minami out of a sense of justice, and is currently the seventh seat in Plant Hwyaden. He controls the Wolves of Mibu, a subdivision of Plant Hwyaden that act more as his personal army rather than follow the orders of Nureha and Intics. He sends Tetra to Shiroe in hopes of turning Shiroe's attention to Minami. Unlike many other players, Kazuhiko hates living in the world of Elder Tale and greatly desires to find a way back to Earth. ;K.R. : :Another former Debauchery Tea Party member, K.R. is a level 90 Summoner. At the start of the Apocalypse, K.R. immediately used a summon to travel the world to see how the other areas were like. He stumbled upon Kanami and her party, and joined them as their mount, much to his distaste. However, during a battle against the Black Dragon and two monsters, he was forced to summon his real body to their location and subsequently died, reviving in Minami. He then joined Plant Hwyaden and currently holds the tenth seat. ; : :The third seat in Plant Hwyaden. ; : :The fourth seat in Plant Hwyaden. ; : :The fifth seat in Plant Hwyaden. ; : :The sixth seat in Plant Hwyaden. ; : :The eighth seat in Plant Hwyaden. ; : :The ninth seat in Plant Hwyaden. = Others = ; :One of the few people Shiroe trusts, ≈åshima was asked to investigate the western city Minami.

They are still allies to the Round Table and offer its members support whenever asked. ; : :Guild master of Silver Sword. He is also known as \\"Mithril Eyes William\\". ; : ; : ; : ; = Brigandia = A dark guild which takes advantage of the lawless nature of the Elder Tale world to control Susukino with an iron grip, until being ousted by the Silver Swords. ; : :Guild master of Brigandia, he was the ruler of Susukino until being defeated by William. Shiroe used to provoke him by misspelling his name. After falling from grace, he falls in love with Upashi and settles down with her. He despises Shiroe because he does not fight using his own power and instead uses others to deal damage while he stays in the shadows. ; : :Also known as Londark of Gray Steel. He was a member of Brigandia and Demikas' second-in- command, but leaves him after his defeat to William. He later joins Plant Hwyaden. = Others = ; : :Demiquas' wife who, despite being one of the people of the land, refused to bow to his threats, thus earning his respect and affection, a fact he refuses to admit. She genuinely seems to love her husband and to be aware of what kind of person he is in the inside.  Chinese Server  = Kanami's Party = ; : :Former leader of Debauchery Tea Party. Her subclass is Monk and was formerly a Swashbuckler. She ended up disbanding the group because she was moving to Europe with her child and was stuck on the European server during the apocalypse, forcing her to travel by herself all the way back to Japan in order to reunite with her friends. She also believes that the secrets behind the Apocalypse lie on the Japanese server, as the \\"Homesteading the Noosphere\\" update was first deployed there. After finally managing to contact Shiroe, she gives him the task of discovering a spell to link the world of Elder Tale and Earth, allowing free transit between the realms. ; : :An American player from New York, whose use of a Fairy Ring landed him in Asia and was subsequently stuck there following the Apocalypse and now travels with Kanami. Fighting with twin swords and donning a fully green suit, his antics and the fact that he had previously lived in the sewers of the Elder Tales' US server, point that his avatar is based on Leonardo from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles His class and subclass are Assassin and Delivery Man respectively. ; : :A former Chinese gold farming bot. Her class is Cleric, she is dressed like maid. After apocalypse she received some type of own sentience, afterwards she was found by Kanami and became her loyal partner. ; : :A 100-level NPC belonging to a group called the Ancient Species. He is also the mascot character of Elder Tale in-universe.  People of the Land  The People of the Land are usually referred to as the non-player characters (NPCs) of the world of Elder Tale. Prior to the Apocalypse they had limited responses and mannerisms to interaction by adventurers and would normally assign quests to them and present rewards should they be completed. After the Apocalypse they somehow became sentient, able to possess emotions, language and much complexity in thought. They are usually weaker in terms of combat orientation as opposed to Adventurers and unlike Adventurers, they do not respawn after being killed, resulting in a permanent death. League of Freedom Cities Eastal ; : :The head of the Corwen clan, ruler of Maihama and chairperson of the League of Freedom Cities. He has an old and wizened appearance with white hair, beard and mustache. He is Lenessia's grandfather. ; : :Sergiatte's granddaughter.

Kunie Clan ; : ; :  Navigators  The Navigators are a group of beings created by an alien race. Their purpose is to search other universes for a resource called \\"Empathion\\" which powers the civilization of their creators and eventually harvest it from the worlds which they discover it. The Navigators are split into two main groups: Observers and Harvesters.  Observers  The Observers are described as artificial intelligences which arrived in the universe containing the world of Elder Tales during an event which they call \\"Match\\". They do not possess bodies of their own and hence occupy the bodies of others while still possessing their host's memories. Their primary objective is to search for empathions. Their main base of operations is located on the Moon. ; : :An observer AI took the body of a secondary character used by Shiroe before the apocalypse. She is a level 90 Summoner half-Alv. Her sub-class is \\"vampire\\", giving her special buffs at night but rendering her weak to exposure to direct sunlight.  Harvesters  The Harvesters are described as creatures of slightly lesser intelligence than observers that were artificially created on the Moon using the bodies of monsters with powerful combat capabilities. Their primary objective is to harvest empathions in the form of magic points and will do so by attacking adventurers with extreme prejudice. They all possess the Genius title. ; :The Genius of necromancy. Kanami and her party encountered this creature on the Chinese server as they made their way to the Japanese server, Yamato. She was defeated by Leonardo after he used his superior speed to overwhelm her. ; :The Genius of healing. This creature was with Lasphere when they encountered Kanami and her party. It seemed to possess a lot of information about the true nature of the world. ; :The Genius of marriage. This creature wandered into the city of Akiba after its protective barrier was disabled by Kinjou and Lenessia. It posed as a Person of the Land and began seducing girls around the city. However, it was defeated when it crossed paths with the Brigade of the West Wind. ; :The Genius of measures. Another creature who infiltrated Akiba after the barrier was disabled. It posed as a Lander who was able to appraise ores and minerals and conned adventurers into paying huge sums of money for worthless materials by changing the quantities of their weight, length and value. In his true form, he is able to manipulate the quantities of distance, speed, skill damage and even targets. This posed an enormous disadvantage to the half-raid team led by Michitaka and almost resulted in their defeat. However, with the help of the Kunie Clan, Roderic was able to create a weapon called the Source Vessel which was able to nullify Bagris' abilities using a similar power and allowed the team to defeat him. ; :The Genius of scandal. The Nyanko Tavern guild faced this monster when it infiltrated Akiba and then reported it to Shiroe. ; :The Genius of poison. The Nyanko Tavern guild encountered this monster before the Scale Festival took place. It had the ability to poison its victims. ; :The Genius of summoning. Based in Shibuya, this monster was responsible for summoning swarms of Eternal Moth monsters from the Moon which attacked the main player cities in order to harvest empathions. It changes from its original form, which has the appearance of an old man, into two other forms depending on its health level. It was the only boss in the Calling Fortress raid and was ultimately taken down by the raiding party led by Shiroe.

In October 2013, Congo told the UN that the M23 movement was virtually finished after being pushed back from its key position at Mount Hehu and Rumanagabo, north of Goma, to an enclave near Rwanda. Congo also re-captured Kiwanja and Rutshuru, where its forces discovered mass graves. On 30 October, Bunagana, the first town seized by the rebels in 2012, was stormed by UN-backed Congolese troops as the rebels abandoned it. Following Uganda's calls for a ceasefire on 1 November and government shelling the next day, as well as a new offensive on 3 November in the hills around the border with Uganda and Rwanda, M23 leader Bertrand Bisimwa called to \\"immediately end hostilities\\". He asked for the facilitator of the Kampala peace talks \\"to immediately put in place a mechanism to monitor the ceasefire.\\" The army accused the rebels of bombing Bunagana. Army spokesman Olivier Hamuli said: \\"This is not fighting, it is bombs launched by M23 targeting the population of Bunagana. They are targeting civilians.\\" Conversely, the rebels said that they were attacked with heavy weapons. Radio Okapi reported that four civilians were killed and 10 others were wounded in Bunagana on 4 November. UN, EU and AU envoys urged both sides not to undo the progress made in peace talks, saying that M23 should renounce its rebellion and the army should hold off from further military action. The next day, following the two-week UN-backed offensive, the government claimed to have defeated the rebels. M23 representatives said that it was ending its rebellion and would disarm and demobilise its forces in order to pursue a political solution. The announcement came hours after its fighters were driven out of its last two strongholds of Tshanzu and Runyoni at about 3:00. Bisimiwa issued a statement that read: \\"The chief of general staff and the commanders of all major units are requested to prepare troops for disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration on terms to be agreed with the government of Congo.\\" Government spokesman Laurent Mende said that many rebel fighters were surrendering and that Congo was ready to pursue peace talks.

On August 17, 2012, the band announced that they were working on an EP and released the music video for \\"Colonel Gentleman\\". For the next few months, little was heard about the album due to the bands extensive touring schedule. On June 14, 2013, a lyric video was released for the single \\"The Action Man\\", which featured Karl Schubach of Misery Signals. With the song's release, the band had announced that the EP was going to be a full-length as they had surpassed their Kickstarter goal of $2000 by nearly a grand. To tie fans over until the album's release, a cover of The Offspring's \\"Gone Away\\" was released on August 9 via YouTube and free download. Release Completionist was released independently on October 4, 2013. The band urged fans to purchase the album off of iTunes. \\"Colonel Gentleman\\" was re-recorded for the album, and now featured guest vocals by Micah Kinard. The song \\"Semper Fidelis Tyrannosaurus\\" which debuted as a single in 2009 originally and was released on the band's demo in 2010 was re- recorded/written for this release as well. The band embarked on a month-long tour, known as Gears of Tour, with My Heart to Fear and Alive in the Dark to promote the album. \\"Lost & Found\\" The music videos for \\"Swifty\\" and \\"H.E.L.P.eR.\\" form a short film called \\"Lost & Found\\". \\"Swifty\\" was the first video released and features a man wandering around various places after a zombie outbreak. The video features cuts of the band performing the song, along with the story. \\"H.E.L.P.eR.\\" serves as the prequel to \\"Swifty\\". The video shows the same man from the previous video with his girlfriend. The two are scavenging through places, before they are saved by the band members and taken to a camp. At the song's climax, various zombies attack the camp causing the man and his girlfriend to be separated and thus setting up for \\"Swifty\\". Reception Upon its release, Completionist has received mainly positive reviews. HM Magazine reviewer Chelc Eaves praised the intro as it \\"opens like a haunting score to horror flick\\" as well as the band's ability to \\"deliver a solid, faith-based messaging\\" as it \\"doesn't seem to choke others out on faith\\". Eaves stated the album delivers \\"the good news in an oxymoronic kind of way - light-hearted and brutal all at once\\". He criticized the electronic elements as they \\"frequently border on amateur\\", but also said it gave the album \\"some twang\\" from other metalcore bands. Indie Vision Music reviewer Brody B. praised the band's DIY ethic and listed \\"Otto Aquarius\\", \\"The Action Man\\", \\"Colonel Gentleman\\" and \\"Swifty\\" as the album's top tracks. He also criticized the over use of electronics, saying it \\"felt a bit forced, rather than natural\\". Track listing All lyrics written by Bobby Huotari. All music composed by Blood of the Martyrs.

He became a member of the Japan Art Academy in 1981. His criticism of the pacifist Japanese establishment of the early post-Second World War era earned him early notoriety, though he is most well-known for his translations of William Shakespeare's oeuvre into Japanese, starting with Hamlet in 1955. He was a frequent contributor to conservative magazines, such as Bungeishunj≈´, Shokun, and Jiy≈´. Called a \\"rhetorician\\", and a \\"conjuror of controversy\\", he frequently used cognitive reframing in his discourse. Life Tsuneari Fukuda was born to K≈çshir≈ç and Masa Fukuda on 25 August 1912 in the Hong≈ç ward (now part of the Bunky≈ç special ward) of Tokyo. His name \\"Tsuneari\\" was chosen by novelist Ishibashi Shian, and originates from the works of the Chinese philosopher Mencius. He attended Tokyo Imperial University, where he studied English literature, graduating in 1936. His graduate thesis was entitled \\"Ethical issues in the works of D. H. Lawrence\\". After graduating, Fukuda worked as a secondary school teacher and a publisher. He began his long career as a literary critic with a contribution to the K≈çd≈ç bungaku literary magazine in 1937, the article entitled \\"Riichi Yokomitsu and The Author's Secret\\". Before and just after the Second World War, he wrote critiques of the works of Ry≈´nosuke Akutagawa, Isota Kamura, and other modern Japanese writers. In 1947, Fukuda's article Ippiki to ky≈´j≈´hiki to (‰∏ÄÂåπ„Å®‰πùÂçÅ‰πùÂåπ), published in the Shisaku magazine, stirred up controversy about the dividing line between literature and politics, and later came to be seen as one of his representative works. From 1949, he participated in the Japanese‚ÄìBritish cultural exchange group \\"Albion Club\\" („ÅÇ„Çã„Å≥„Çà„Çì„Éª„Åè„Çâ„Å∂). From 1950 onward, Fukuda's interest shifted away from general literary criticism and critiques of individual writers. Representative works from this period include Geijutsu to wa nanika (ËóùË°ì„Å®„ÅØ‰Ωï„Åã; lit. 'What is Art?'), published in 1950, and Ningen, kono gekiteki naru mono (‰∫∫Èñì„Éª„Åì„ÅÆÂäáÁöÑ„Å™„Çã„ÇÇ„ÅÆ; lit. 'Man, this dramatic being') published in 1956. What made Fukuda famous, however, was his status as a lone conservative voice amidst a flourishing of progressive thought in post-Second World War Japan. In his 1954 article Heiwaron no susumekata ni tsuite no gimon (Âπ≥ÂíåË´ñ„ÅÆÈÄ≤„ÇÅÊñπ„Å´„Å§„ÅÑ„Å¶„ÅÆÁñëÂïè; lit. 'Doubts about the advancement of the pacifist theory'), he criticised the pacifism that had become dominant in Japan. Furthermore, he was a strong critic of the post-war reforms to the Japanese language, and in 1955‚Äì56, he participated in a public debate with advocates of those reforms, led by Ky≈çsuke Kindaichi, in which he pointed out what he saw as the illogical nature of the T≈çy≈ç kanji list and modern kana usage. On this subject, he released the book Watashi no kokugoky≈çshitsu (ÁßÅ„ÅÆÂúãË™ûÊïôÂÆ§; lit. 'My Japanese language classroom') in 1960, where he advocated for the reversal of the post-war Japanese script reforms, which he argued were irrational and destructive, the preservation of historical kana usage and the abolition of restrictions on the usage of kanji. Fukuda himself never adopted the style mandated by the reforms, writing in historical kana and traditional kanji, though some publishing houses converted his writing into modern usage after his death. His representative works as a literary translator include Shakespeare's Macbeth, Hamlet, Richard III and A Midsummer Night's Dream, Ernest Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea, and Oscar Wilde's Salome and The Picture of Dorian Gray. In the 1950s, Fukuda also wrote and produced plays, including Kitty Typhoon and also The Man Who Stroked a Dragon. He was linked to Shingeki, and in 1955 he did a production of Hamlet with Hiroshi Akutagawa, son of Ry≈´nosuke Akutagawa, playing the lead role. He also wrote a 1957 essay Directing Shakespeare, which dealt with his views on the subject of directing Shakespearean plays. Later he did a Japanese version, based on his translation, of A Midsummer Night's Dream. In addition, he helped found the Theatre Company Subaru and received the Yomiuri Prize multiple times. He died at the age of 82 from complications related to pneumonia at T≈çkai University ≈åiso Hospital on 20 November 1994.

A year later, he was arrested in a homeless shelter in Toronto with $10 worth of cocaine. When Canadian authorities attempted to deport Walker to the United States, American authorities determined that his passport was fraudulent (they were unable to find any record of Walker before 2001) and revoked it.

With the rising tension between the Greeks and the Jews the Alexandrines had organized a public assembly to deliberate about an embassy to Nero, and a great number of Jews came flocking to the amphitheater. When the Alexandrines saw the Jews they attacked them. They killed the majority of the Jews and those who were captured were burned alive. The Jews wanted retaliation for what the Greeks had done and threatened to do it with violence. However, Tiberius Julius Alexander, governor of the city, was able to restrain them. Tiberius privately sent for the principal men of the Jews, and convinced them to be quiet, and not provoke the Roman army against them. But the seditious did not take the threat seriously, and reproached him for so uttering threats. The governor now understood that those who were most riotous would not be pacified unless some great calamity would overtake them. He sent out the two Roman legions that were in the city (Legio III Cyrenaica and the Legio XXII Deiotariana), together with 5,000 other soldiers, to punish the Jews. They were permitted not only to kill them, but to plunder them of what they had, and to set fire to their houses. The Romans showed no mercy to the infants, had no regard for the aged, and went on in the slaughter of persons of every age; over 50,000 Jews lay dead in the streets. Tiberius Julius Alexander eventually took mercy on the Jews and called off the attacks. This was but one of many riots that broke out in not only Alexandria, but also in Damascus, Caesarea and in many other places. During the events, the prefect Julius Alexander attacked the Jewish quarter of the city. Historic perspective The tensions between the Jews and Greco-Romans in Alexandria began after the riots of 38 CE, with another violent event following in 55 CE. Later, the Jewish‚ÄìRoman wars had a great impact on Alexandria, with the major Jewish community of the city engaging in extensive riots in 66 CE. A much greater violence followed 50 years later, when in 117 CE, the Jews of Alexandria participated in the great disturbances of the Kitos War, succeeding in destroying much of the Greek city before the Roman Army descended upon the city to quell the revolt.

He is known for his high quality Portrait miniatures and is considered one of the best draughtsmen in late seventeenth-century Britain. He worked mainly in plumbago, pencil and sepia, but also painted portraits in oil. Biography His earliest known works are copies of oils formerly in the collection of Charles I by Giovanni Cariani and Titian dating from 1667. Paton also copied works of older contemporary Samuel Cooper including the famous 1665 large rectangular miniature of Charles II. One copy, signed and dated 1668, is at Ham House, the other, a year later, is in the collection of the duke of Buccleuch. William Murray, 1st Earl of Dysart Portrait miniature by David Paton A copy by Paton after the miniature of William Murray, 1st Earl of Dysart, attributed to David des Granges, is also at Ham House as are both the original and Paton's copy of John Hoskins' large rectangular limning of Murray's wife; Katherine Bruce, dated 1638. Paton is known to have been in Italy in the 1670s and 1680s with The Hon. William Tollemache (1662‚Äì1694), the youngest son of his patron, Murray's daughter; Elizabeth Maitland, Duchess of Lauderdale, on his Grand Tour. Paton's self-portrait, a miniature dated 1683, is held in the collection of the Uffizi Gallery, Florence. Following the tour, Paton appears to have worked mainly in Edinburgh. Perhaps Paton's most notable work, The Yester Lords dates from this period, now thought to depict John Maitland, and his younger brother Charles (c.1620‚Äì1691) and not, as previously believed, members of the Hay family, who lived at Yester House. John Graham of Claverhouse, Viscount (‚ÄòBonnie‚Äô) Dundee by David Paton Paton's other works of the period include Jacobite leader John Graham of Claverhouse, Viscount (‚ÄòBonnie‚Äô) Dundee, Charles II; James Scott, First Earl of Dalkeith; Sir John Dalrymple, 1st Earl of Stair; and William III (1695), Sir John Clerk of Penicuik, First Baronet, Charles Stuart, 4th Earl of Traquair and his wife, Mary Maxwell, Countess of Traquair. Three groups, each containing five small medallion portraits (chiefly of members of the Hamilton family), which were at Hamilton Palace, Lanarkshire, bear his name and the date 1693. Paton cites: In 1698 he received ¬£2 18s. for a picture for James Douglas, 2nd Duke of Queensberry, and ¬£5 16s. from the same source the year after. A portrait of General Tam Dalyell of the Binns was also ascribed to Paton.

The museum was first established in 1969 as the only national art museum in the country accommodating modern and contemporary art of Korea and international art of different time periods. History and Architectural style *Gwacheon-guan (main museum) The National Museum of Contemporary Art (MMCA), also known as Gwacheon Contemporary Art Museum, is located in Gwacheon, South Korea. The museum was initially established in Gyeongbokgung on October 20, 1969, but was moved to Deoksugung in 1973. It was moved to its current location in 1986. Founded to contribute to the development of Korean contemporary art by systematically conserving and exhibiting artworks created since 1910, the museum‚Äôs area of 73,360„é° spreads over three floors, and has an outdoor sculpture park occupying 33,000„é°. The motif of the architecture is that of a traditional Korean fortress and beacon mound, and the building has a unique spiral- formed interior where Dadaigseon, one of the most famous video artworks by Nam June Paik, is located. *Deoksugung-guan (first branch) The first branch of the MMCA was established in 1998 in Seokjo-jeon of Deoksugung (Jeong-dong, Jung-gu, Seoul, South Korea), in order to further increase the museum‚Äôs accessibility for people living in the northern part of Seoul. The museum has four exhibition halls, rest zones and art shops, and the total area is approximately 3,428„é°. *Seoul-guan (second branch) The Seoul branch of the museum opened in November 13, 2013, next to Gyeongbokgung. Built on and next to the former Military Defense Security Command building, the architectural design adopted the madang (yard) concept, which successfully integrated the exterior and interior of the building to the surrounding environment. The madang also serves as a public leisure space as well as a space to hold outdoor artistic events and programs. *Cheongju-guan (storage) The third branch of the MMCA is currently under construction in Cheongju-si, Choongcheongbuk-do, South Korea, with its prospective opening in 2016. The purpose of the third branch is not only to conserve artworks, but also to train people in art conservation. Collections and Exhibitions Opertus Lunula Umbra (Hidden Shadow of the Moon) by U-ram Choe at Seoul branch opening, 2013 The collections of the main museum in Gwacheon includes around 7,000 artworks including works of contemporary Korean artists such as Go Hui- dong, Ku Bon-ung, Park Su-geun, and Kim Whan-ki. The museum has also gathered a substantial internationally recognized collection including artworks by Joseph Beuys, Andy Warhol, Georg Baselitz, J√∂rg Immendorff, Marcus L√ºpertz, Nam June Paik, Nikki de Saint-Phalle, Jonathan Borofsky, and Michelangelo Pistoletto. Past exhibitions include the installation of Sinseon Play - Moon Ji Bang as a part of the Young Architects Program at MoMA and MoMA PS1 in 2014. In 2011, the MMCA hosted the exhibition The American Art, which was ‚Äúthe first occasion to exhibit the Collection of Whitney Museum, in Asia,‚Äù featuring artists such as Jeff Koons, Andy Warhol, and Jasper Johns. Likewise in 2010, the museum hosted the exhibition Picasso and Modern Art, which was the first exhibition of collections from the Albertina Museum (Vienna, Austria) in an East Asian country. In addition to loan exhibitions, the MMCA has mounted special exhibitions of Korean art, such as Acquisitions in Korean Art 1960-1980, and Masterpieces of Korean Modern Art: Exploration of Modern History in 2008. Departments *Education The MMCA has various art education programs including professional education programs for curators, employees of museums, art teachers, and college students. The Children‚Äôs Museum is located in Gwacheon main museum, where programs for elementary students, disabled students and students from poor neighborhoods are held. There is also a special support program for young artists, called ‚ÄòResidency,‚Äô in which the museum provides studios for selected young artists and holds art conversations among artists and art professionals. *Research and Conservation The conservation center of the museum was first established in 1980. The center has been working to develop its modern techniques for conservation by holding exchange programs with overseas conservation centers. Currently, the center is divided into four professional departments: oil paintings, Korean traditional artworks, contemporary sculptures, and medium of artworks. Furthermore, the museum opened its ‚Äòart research center‚Äô in 2013, which focuses on the research of East Asian contemporary art. Seoul branch Controversies Shortly after its opening, members of the Korean Fine Arts Association and other artist organizations protested over the selection of art for inclusion, charging the Director, a graduate of Seoul National University, with a bias toward graduates of that school, noting that 32 of the 39 artists represented in the exhibition Zeitgeist Korea are from his alma mater.

The Swedish invasion sparked the Swedish-Brandenburg War that, following further declarations of war by European powers allied with Brandenburg, expanded into a North European conflict that did not end until 1679. The trigger for the Swedish invasion was the participation of a 20,000 strong Brandenburg Army in the Holy Roman Empire's war on France as part of the Franco-Dutch War. As a result, Sweden, a traditional ally of France, occupied the militarily unprotected margraviate with the declared aim of forcing the Elector of Brandenburg to sue for peace with France. In early June 1675 the Elector and his 15,000 strong army decamped at Schweinfurt in Franconia, now southern Germany, and reached the city of Magdeburg on . In a campaign lasting less than ten days, Elector Frederick William forced the Swedish troops to retreat from the Margraviate of Brandenburg.  Background  After the War of Devolution, Louis XIV, King of France, pressed for retribution against the States-General. He initiated diplomatic activities with the aim of isolating Holland completely. To that end, on 24 April 1672 in Stockholm, France concluded a secret treaty with Sweden that bound the Scandinavian power to contribute 16,000 troops against any German state that gave military support to the Republic of Holland. The Swedish Empire in the 17th century Immediately thereafter, in June 1672, Louis XIV invaded the States-General - thus sparking the Franco-Dutch War - and advanced to just short of Amsterdam. The Elector of Brandenburg, in accordance with treaty provisions, supported the Dutch in the fight against France with 20,000 men in August 1672. In December 1673, Brandenburg-Prussia and Sweden concluded a ten-year defensive alliance. However, both sides reserved freedom to choose their alliances in the event of war. Because of his defensive alliance with Sweden, during the period that followed the Elector of Brandenburg did not expect Sweden to enter the war on the French side. And despite the separate Treaty of Vossem agreed between Brandenburg and France on 16 June 1673, Brandenburg rejoined the war against France in the following year, when the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire declared an imperial war (Reichskrieg) against France in May 1674. On 23 August 1674, therefore, a 20,000 strong Brandenburg army marched out again from the Margraviate of Brandenburg heading for Strasbourg. Elector Frederick William and Electoral Prince Charles Emil of Brandenburg accompanied this army. John George II of Anhalt-Dessau was appointed Statthalter (\\"Governor\\") of Brandenburg. Through bribes and by promising subsidies France now succeeded in persuading its traditional allies, Sweden, which had only escaped losing all of Pomerania with France's intervention in the Treaty of Oliva in 1660, to enter the war against Brandenburg. The decisive factor was the concern of the Swedish royal court that a French defeat would result in the political isolation of Sweden. The goal of Sweden's entry into the war was to occupy the undefended state of Brandenburg in order to force Brandenburg-Prussia to withdraw its troops from war zones in the Upper Rhine and the Alsace.  Preparations for war  Field Marshal Carl Gustav Wrangel, Commander-in-Chief of the Swedish Army. Painting by Matth√§us Merian the Younger, 1662 The Swedes then began to assemble an invasion force in Swedish Pomerania. From September more and more reports of these troops movements were received in Berlin. In particular, the Governor of Brandenburg notified his Elector in early September of a conversation with the Swedish envoy, Wangelin, in which he had announced that about 20,000 Swedish troops would be available in Pomerania before the end of the month.Michael Rohrschneider: Johann Georg II. von Anhalt-Dessau (1627‚Äì1693). Eine politische Biographie, p. 233 The news of an impending attack by the Swedish army grew stronger when, in the second half of October, the arrival in Wolgast of the Swedish commander-in-chief, Carl Gustav Wrangel, was reported. John George II of Anhalt-Dessau, clearly troubled by news of the troop build-up, asked Field Marshal Carl Gustav Wrangel several times in late October, through Brandenburg colonel, Mikrander for the reasons for these troop movements. Wrangel, however, failed to answer and refused another attempt at dialogue by the Prince of AnhaltSamuel Buchholz:Versuch einer Geschichte der Churmark Brandenburg, Vierter Teil: neue Geschichte, p. 92 In mid-November the governor, John George II, had received assurance of an impending Swedish invasion, but in Berlin the exact causes and motives for such imminent aggression remained unclear.Michael Rohrschneider: Johann Georg II. von Anhalt-Dessau (1627‚Äì1693). Eine politische Biographie, p. 238 In spite of the disturbing news coming from Berlin, Elector Frederick William himself did not believe that there was an imminent Swedish invasion of the Margraviate of Brandenburg. He expressed this in a letter to the Governor of Brandenburg on 31 October 1674, which stated, amongst other things: The strength of the assembled Swedish invasion army in Swedish Pomerania before they entered the Uckermark at the end of December 1674 was, according to the contemporary sources in the Theatrum Europaeum as follows: * Infantry: eleven regiments with a total of 7,620 men.Anonym: Theatrum Europaeum, Vol. 11, p. 566 * Cavalry: eight regiments, totalling 6,080 men. * Artillery: 15 cannon of various calibres. The forces available on 23 August 1674 to defend the Margraviate of Brandenburg, following the departure of its main army for Alsace, were pitiful. The Elector had few soldiers, and they were mainly old or disabled. The few combat-capable units at his disposal were stationed in fortresses as garrison troops. The overal strength of the garrison troops that the Governor had at his disposal at the end of August 1674 was only around 3,000 men.Curt Jany: Geschichte der Preu√üischen Armee. Vom 15. Jahrhundert‚Äì1914. Vol. 1: Von den Anf√§ngen bis 1740. 2., expanded edn.: Geschichte der Preu√üischen Armee. Vom 15. Jahrhundert‚Äì1914. Vol. 1: Von den Anf√§ngen bis 1740. 2., expanded edn., p. 230 In the capital city, Berlin, there were at the time only 500 older soldiers, left behind due to their limited fighting ability, and 300 new recruits.Michael Rohrschneider: Johann Georg II. von Anhalt-Dessau (1627‚Äì1693). Eine politische Biographie, p. 234 The recruitment of fresh troops had therefore to be enforced immediately. In addition, the Elector ordered the Governor to issue a general call up to the rural population and the towns and cities, in order to compensate for the lack of trained soldiers. The so-called Landvolkaufgebot (\\"people's call up\\") went back to medieval legal standards in the state of Brandenburg, by which farmers and citizens could be used in case of need for local defence. But only after protracted negotiations between the Imperial Estates, towns and cities on the one hand and the privy councillors and the Governor on the other hand did the state succeed at the end of December 1674 in enforcing the call up. Most of this edict was applied in the residenz towns of C√∂lln, Berlin and Friedrichswerder (8 companies of 1,300 men).Curt Jany: Geschichte der Preu√üischen Armee. Vom 15. Jahrhundert‚Äì1914. Vol. 1: Von den Anf√§ngen bis 1740. 2nd revised edition, p. 236 It was also successfully employed in the Altmark to mobilize farmers and heathland rangers (mounted forestry personnel familiar with the terrain) and for defence. The governor received more reinforcements at the end of January 1675 through the dispatch of troops from the Westphalian provinces.  Course of the campaign   Swedish invasion ‚Äì Occupation of the Margraviate (25 Dec 1674 ‚Äì Apr 1675)  On 15/25 December 1674 Swedish troops marched through Pasewalk and invaded the Uckermark without a formal declaration of war. In fact, according to a message from the Swedish field marshal, Carl Gustav Wrangel, to the Brandenburg envoy, Dubislav von Hagen, on 20/30 December 1674, the Swedish Army would leave the Mark of Brandenburg as soon as Brandenburg ended its state of war with France. A complete break of relations between Sweden and Brandenburg was not intended however.Michael Rohrschneider: Johann Georg II. von Anhalt-Dessau (1627‚Äì1693). Eine politische Biographie, p. 239 Figures relating the initial strength of this army, almost half of which was to consist of Germans by spring, vary in the sources between 13,700 and 16,000 menThe figure of 16,000, which corresponds to the 1672 treaty agreement between France and Sweden, is given inter alia in: Samuel Buchholz:Versuch einer Geschichte der Churmark Brandenburg, Vierter Teil: neue Geschichte, p. 92 and 30 guns. To support Field Marshal Carl Gustav Wrangel, who was over 60 years old, often bedridden and suffering from gout, field marshals Simon Grundel-Helmfelt and Otto Wilhelm von K√∂nigsmarck were appointed alongside him. However, this unclear assignment prevented inter alia clear orders being issued, so that directions for the movement of the army were only put into effect very slowlyFriedrich Ferdinand Carlson: Geschichte Schwedens ‚Äì bis zum Reichstage 1680. p. 603 The entry of Sweden into the war attracted the general attention of European powers. The military glory of the Thirty Years' War had made the military power of Sweden seem overpowering in the eyes of her contemporaries. German mercenaries willingly offered their services to the Swedes. Some German states (Bavaria, the Electorate of Saxony, Hanover and the Bishopric of M√ºnster) agreed to join the Swedish-French alliance.Friedrich Ferdinand Carlson: Geschichte Schwedens ‚Äì bis zum Reichstage 1680. p. 602 The Swedish Army established its headquarters at Prenzlau. It was joined there another department, established in Swedish Bremen-Verden, under General Dalwig. At the same time, after the defeat of imperial Brandenburg in the Battle of Turckheim against the French on 26 December 1674, Brandenburg's main army marched to its winter quarters in and around Schweinfurt, reaching the area on 31 January 1675.Friedrich F√∂rster: Friedrich Wilhelm, der grosse Kurf√ºrst, und seine Zeit, page 127 Because of wintry weather and the losses he had suffered, the Elector decided that he would not deploy his main army immediately on a new campaign in the Uckermark.Friedrich F√∂rster: Friedrich Wilhelm, der grosse Kurf√ºrst, und seine Zeit, page 131 In addition, a sudden withdrawal from the western theatre of war would have alarmed Brandenburg-Prussia's allies - thus achieving the ultimate goal of the Swedish invasion, i.e. to force Brandenburg to withdraw from the war with France. Without further reinforcements the open regions of the Neumark east of the Oder and Farther Pomerania could not be held by Brandenburg, except at a few fortified locations. The Mittelmark, by contrast, could be held with relatively few troops, because to the north there were only a few easily defended passes, near Oranienburg, Kremmen, Fehrbellin and Friesack, through the marshlands of the Havelland Luch and the Rhinluch. In the east, the March was covered by the river course of the Oder. The few available Brandenburg soldiers were recalled to fortified locations. In this way, as a result of the prevailing circumstances, Brandenburg's defences were formed along the line from K√∂penick, via Berlin, Spandau, Oranienburg, Kremmen, Fehrbellin and Havelberg to the River Elbe. In addition the garrison of Spandau Fortress was reinforced from 250 to 800 men; it also had 24 cannon of varying calibres. In Berlin the garrison was increased to 5,000 men (including the Leibdragoner (\\"dragoon bodyguard\\") dispatched by the Elector from Franconia and the reinforcements sent from the province of Westphalia at the end of January). The Swedes, however, remained inactive and failed to take advantage of the absence of the Brandenburg army and occupy wide areas of the Margraviate of Brandenburg. They focused first - whilst maintaining strict discipline - on the levying of war contributions and on building up the army to 20,000 by recruiting mercenaries. This inaction was partially due to the internal political conflict between the old and the new government of Sweden, which prevented clear military aims being set. Contradictory orders were issued; command was soon followed by counter-command. At the end of January 1675, Carl Gustav Wrangel assembled his forces near Prenzlau and, on 4 February, crossed the Oder with his main body heading for Pomerania and Neumark. Swedish troops occupied Stargard in Pommern, Landsberg, Neustettin, Kossen and Z√ºllichau in order to recruit there as well. Farther Pomerania was occupied as far as Lauenburg and several smaller places. Then Wrangel settled the Swedish army into winter quarters in Pomerania and the Neumark. When it became clear in the early spring that Brandenburg-Prussia would not withdraw from the war, the Swedish court in Stockholm issued the order for a stricter regime of occupation to be enforced in order to raise pressure on the Elector to pull out of the war. This change in Swedish occupation policy followed swiftly, with the result that repression of the state and the civilian population increased sharply. Several contemporary chroniclers described these excesses as worse, both in extent and brutality, than during the Thirty Years' War. There was no significant fighting, however, until spring 1675. The statthalter of the March of Brandenburg, John George II of Anhalt-Dessau described this state of limbo in a letter to the Elector 24 March/3 April 1675:  Swedish spring campaign (early May 1675 - 25 Jun 1675)  The French envoy in Stockholm demanded on 20/30 Mar, that the Swedish Army extended its occupation to Silesia and conducted itself in agreement with French plans. The French position changed, however, in the weeks that followed and gave the Swedes more leeway in decision making in this theatre. However the envoy in Stockholm expressed concern due to the alleged failure of the Swedish troops.Friedrich Ferdinand Carlson: Geschichte Schwedens ‚Äì bis zum Reichstage 1680. p. 604 In early May 1675 the Swedes began the spring campaign that had been strongly urged by the French. Its aim was to cross the Elbe to link up with Swedish forces in Bremen-Verden and the 13,000 strong army of their ally, John Frederick, Duke of Brunswick and Lunenburg, in order to cut the approach route of the Elector and his army into Brandenburg.Michael Rohrschneider: Johann Georg II. von Anhalt-Dessau (1627‚Äì1693). Eine politische Biographie, p. 253 So an army that had now grown to 20,000 men and 64 cannon entered the Uckermark, passing through Stettin. Although the capability of the Swedish Army was not comparable to that of earlier times, the former view of Sweden's military might remained. This led, not least, to rapid early success. The first fighting took place in the region of L√∂cknitz where, on 5/15 May 1675, the fortified castle held by a 180-man garrison under Colonel G√∂tz was surrendered after a day's shelling to the Swedish Army under the command of Oberwachtmeister Jobst Sigismund, in return for free passage to Oderburg. As a result, G√∂tz was later sentenced to death by a court martial and executed on 24 March 1676.Curt Jany: Geschichte der Preu√üischen Armee. Vom 15. Jahrhundert‚Äì1914. Vol. 1: Von den Anf√§ngen bis 1740. 2nde expanded edition, page 238 Following the capture of L√∂cknitz, the Swedes pushed rapidly south and occupied Neustadt, Wriezen and Bernau. Their next objective was the Rhinluch, which was only passable in a few places. These had been occupied by Brandenburg with militia (Landj√§ger), armed farmers and heath rangers (Heidereitern) as a precaution. The governor (Statthalter) sent troops from Berlin and six cannon as reinforcements under the command of Major General von Sommerfeld in order to be able to mount a coordinated defence of the passes at Oranienburg, Kremmen and Fehrbellin. The Swedes advanced on the Rhin line in three columns: the first, under General Stahl, against Oranienburg; the second, under General Dalwig, against Kremmen; and the third, which at 2,000 men was the strongest, under General Groothausen, against Fehrbellin. There was heavy fighting for the river crossing for several days in front of Fehrbellin. Because the Swedes did not succeed in breaking through here, the column diverted to Oranienburg, where, thanks to advice from local farmers, a crossing had been found which enabled about 2,000 Swedes to press on to the south. As a consequence, the positions on either side at Kremmen, Oranienburg and Fehrbellin had to be abandoned by Brandenburg. Shortly thereafter, the Swedes mounted an unsuccessful storming of Spandau Fortress. The whole Havelland was now occupied by the Swedes, whose headquarters was initially established in the town of Brandenburg. After the capture of Havelberg the Swedish HQ was moved to Rheinsberg on 8/18 June. Field Marshal Carl Gustav Wrangel, who left Stettin on 26 May/6 June to follow the army, only made it as far Neubrandenburg, because a severe attack of gout left him bedridden for 10 days. Overall command was devolved to Lieutenant General Wolmar Wrangel. To make matters worse, disunity broke out amongst the generals, resulting in general discipline in the army being lost and serious plundering and other abuses by the soldiery against the civil population took place. So that the troops could continue to be supplied with the necessary food and provision, their quarters were widely separated. As a result of this interruption the Swedes lost two valuable weeks in crossing the Elbe. Sick and borne on a sedan chair, Field Marshal Carl Gustav Wrangel finally reached Neuruppin on 9/19 June. He immediately banned all looting and ordered reconnaissance detachments to be sent towards Magdeburg. On 11/21 June, he set out with a regiment of infantry and two cavalry regiments (1,500 horse) for Havelberg, which he reached on 12/22 in order to occupy the Altmark that summer. To that end, he had all available craft assembled on the River Havel in order to construct a pontoon bridge across the Elbe. At the same time he gave orders to his stepbrother, Lieutenant General Wolmar Wrangel, to bring up the main army and advance with him over the bridge at Rathenow towards Havelberg.Friedrich Ferdinand Carlson: Geschichte Schwedens ‚Äì bis zum Reichstage 1680. p. 605 Lieutenant General Wrangel, commander-in-chief of the main body, under whose command were some 12,000 men, was at this time in the city of Brandenburg an der Havel. The communication link between Havelberg and Brandenburg an der Havel was held by just one regiment at Rathenow. This flank, secured only by a small force, offered a good point of attack for an enemy advancing from the west. At this time, on 21 June, a majority of the March of Brandenburg was in Swedish hands. However, the planned Swedish crossing of the Elbe at Havelberg on 27 June never came to fruition. In the meantime, Elector of Brandenburg Frederick William tried to secure allies, knowing full well that the national forces at his disposal were, on their own, not sufficient for a campaign against the military might of Sweden. For this purpose, he went on 9 March for talks at The Hague, which he reached on 3 May. The negotiations and necessary appointments with the friendly powers gathered there lasted until 20 May. As a result, Holland and Spain declared war on Sweden at the urging of the Elector. Apart from that, he received no concrete assistance from the Holy Roman Empire or Denmark, whereupon the Elector decided to retake the March of Brandenburg from the Swedes without assistance. On 6 June 1675 he held a military parade and had the army break camp from its quarters on the River Main. The advance of the 15,000 strong army to Magdeburg was undertaken in three columns.  Campaign by Elector Frederick William (23 ‚Äì 29 June 1675)  Map of the campaign by Elector Frederick William (23 ‚Äì 29 June) On 21 June the Brandenburg army reached Magdeburg. As a result of inadequate reconnaissance the arrival of Brandenburg appeared not to have been noticed by the Swedes, and so Frederick William adopted security measures to protect this tactical advantage. Not until he reached Magdeburg, did he receive accurate information about the local situation. From intercepted letters, it appeared that Swedish and Hanoverian troops were about to join forces and attack the fortress of Magdeburg. After holding a military council, the Elector decided to break through the line of the Havel that the Swedes had now reached at their weakest point, at Rathenow. His intent was to separate the two parts of the Swedish army at Havelberg and the city of Brandenburg from one another. On the morning of 23 June, around 3 a.m., the army set out from Magdeburg. Since the success of the plan depended on the element of surprise, the Elector advanced only with his cavalry, which consisted of 5,000 troopers in 30 squadrons and 600 dragoons. In addition there were 1,350 musketeers who were transported on wagons to ensure their mobility. The artillery comprised 14 guns of various calibres.Curt Jany: Geschichte der Preu√üischen Armee. Vom 15. Jahrhundert‚Äì1914. Vol. 1: Von den Anf√§ngen bis 1740. 2nd enhanced edition, Page 239 This army was led by the Elector and the already 69-year-old Field Marshal Georg von Derfflinger. The cavalry was under the command of General of Cavalry Frederick, Landgrave of Hesse-Homburg, Lieutenant General of G√∂rztke and Major General L√ºdeke. The infantry was commanded by two major-generals, von G√∂tze and von P√∂llnitz. On 25 June 1675 the Brandenburg army reached Rathenow. Under the personal guidance of Brandenburg's Field Marshal Georg von Derfflinger, they succeeded in defeating the Swedish garrison consisting of six companies of dragoons in bloody street fighting. That same day the Swedish main army marched from Brandenburg an der Havel to Havelberg, where the crossing of the Elbe was to take place. But the overall strategic situation had changed dramatically because of the recapture of this important position. The ensuing separation of the two Swedish armies, who were caught entirely by surprise, meant that a crossing of the Elbe at Havelber was no longer possible. Field Marshal Carl Gustav Wrangel, who was in Havelberg at an undefended location and without supplies, now gave the main Swedish army under Wolmar Wrangel the command to join him via Fehrbellin. So in order to unite his troops with the main army Field Marshal Carl Gustav Wrangel left for Neustadt on 16/26 June. The Swedish headquarters appears to have been completely unaware of the actual location and the strength of the Brandenburg army. Lieutenant General Wolmar Wrangel now retired rapidly north to secure his lines of communication and, as ordered, to unite with the now separated Swedish advance guard. The location of Sweden at the fall of Rathenow on was Pritzerbe. From here there were only 2 exit routes because of the peculiar natural features in the March of Brandenburg at that time. The shorter passage was, however, threatened by the Brandenburg troops and the road conditions were considered to be extremely difficult. So the Swedes decided to use the route via Nauen, where they could branch out from a) Fehrbellin to Neuruppin, b) Kremmen to Gransee and c) Oranienburg to Prenzlau. However, since both Oranienburg and Kremmen appeared to the Swedes to be occupied by the enemy, the only option open to them was to retreat via Nauen to Fehrbellin. Early on, the Swedish general sent an advance party of 160 cavalry to secure the passage of Fehrbellin. The Elector immediately divided his force into three to block the only three passes. The first division under Lieutenant Colonel Hennig was dispatched to Fehrbellin, the second under Adjutant General Kunowski was sent to Kremmen, the third under the command of Captain (Rittmeister) Zabelitz was deployed to Oranienburg. They had the task, with the help of expert local hunters, of getting to the exits to the Havelland Luch swamps ahead of the Swedes, using little known routes through rough terrain. There, the bridges were to be destroyed and the roads made impassable. For this purpose, these exits were to be defended by an armed militia group and by hunters. Details are only available for the first troop of Lieutenant Colonel Hennig's division. This sub-unit of 100 cuirassiers and 20 dragoons, guided by an experienced local forester, rode through the Rhinfurt at Landin and from thence to Fehrbellin. Once there, taking advantage of the element of surprise, they attacked the contingent of 160 Swedish cuirassiers manning the fieldworks guarding the causeway. In this battle, about 50 Swedes were killed FraFrank Bauer: Fehrbellin 1675. Brandenburg-Preu√üens Aufbruch zur Gro√ümacht, page 108 A captain, a lieutenant and eight soldiers were captured, the rest escaping with their commander, Lieutenant Colonel Tropp, leaving their horses behind. Brandenburg lost 10 troopers. The Brandenburg soldiers then set fire to the two Rhin bridges on the causeway. Then the causeway itself was also breached in order to cut off the Swedes' avenue of retreat to the north.

In the middle of the painting is Elector Frederick William on a stallion. Painting by Dismar Degen, 1740 Since no order was issued to hold the pass at all costs because of its importance for the possible withdrawal of Swedish troops, the Brandenburg division attempted to rejoin the main army. On the afternoon of 17/27 June (after the actual battle at Nauen) they arrived back with the main body. The reports by this and the two other divisions reinforced the Elector's view to fight a decisive battle against the Swedes. On 27 June the first battle between the Swedish rearguard and Brandenburg vanguard took place: the Battle of Nauen, which ended with the recapture of the town. By evening, the two main armies were drawn up opposite one another in battle formation. However, the Swedish position appeared too strong for a successful attack by Brandenburg and the Brandenburg troops were exhausted by having to undertake forced marches in the days beforehand. So the Elector's orders were to withdraw into or behind the town of Nauen and make camp there. On the Brandenburg side the expectation was that they would begin engaging the next morning at the gates of Nauen in the decisive battle. The Swedes, however, took advantage of the cover of night to retreat towards Fehrbellin. From the beginning of their withdrawal on 25 June until after the battle at Nauen on 27 June, the Swedes lost a total of about 600 men during their retreat and another 600 were taken prisoner.Frank Bauer: Fehrbellin 1675. Brandenburg- Preu√üens Aufbruch zur Gro√ümacht, page 112 As the causeway and the bridge over the Rhin had been destroyed the day before by the Brandenburg raid, Sweden were forced to participate in the decisive battle. Lieutenant General Wolmar Wrangel had 11,000-12,000 men and seven cannon at his disposal.Frank Bauer: Fehrbellin 1675. Brandenburg-Preu√üens Aufbruch zur Gro√ümacht, page 120 The Swedes were disastrously defeated in this well-known engagement known as the Battle of Fehrbellin, but succeeded under cover of night in crossing of the restored bridge. But their losses increased significantly during the retreat through the Prignitz and Mecklenburg. During the battle and subsequent rout 2,400 Swedish troops were killed, and 300 to 400 captured, whilst Brandenburg lost 500 men kille or wounded.Frank Bauer: Fehrbellin 1675. Brandenburg- Preu√üens Aufbruch zur Gro√ümacht, page 131 Not until they reached Wittstock did Brandenburg call off the pursuit.  Consequences  The Swedish army had suffered a crushing defeat and, particularly as a result of their defeat at Fehrbellin, lost their hitherto perceived aura of invincibility. The remnants of the army found themselves back on Swedish territory in Pomerania, from where they had started the war. Sweden's overall strategic situation deteriorated further when, during the summer months, Denmark and the Holy Roman Empire declared war on Sweden. Their possessions in North Germany (the bishoprics of Bremen and Verden) were suddenly under threat. In the years that followed, Sweden, now forced onto the back foot, had to concentrate on defending its territories in northern Europe against numerous attacks, succeeding in the end only in holding onto Scania. France's strategic plan, by contrast, had proved successful: Brandenburg-Prussia was still officially at war with France, but its army had pulled back from the Rhine front and had to concentrate all its further efforts in the war against Sweden.

He holds the Raymond and Beverly Sackler Chair in Bioinformatics, and is the founder and head of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Bioinformatics at Tel Aviv University.  Biography  Ron Shamir was born in Jerusalem, Israel in 1953, the eldest son of Varda and Raphael Shamir. His father's Sepharadic family has lived in the old city of Jerusalem for over 400 years. His mother‚Äôs parents were pioneers who came from Russia to Israel in the Third Aliyah in the early 1920s. He has two younger sisters, Daphna and Gadit. Shamir studied in Gymnasia Rehavia, Jerusalem, for 12 years. In high school, he was active in the scouts and in athletics; among other accomplishments, he won the Jerusalem high school championship in shot put. Shamir started his B.Sc. studies in mathematics and physics at Tel-Aviv University (1973‚Äì1975) and completed his degree at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (1975‚Äì1977). He later began M.Sc. studies in operations research at Tel-Aviv University under the supervision of Uri Yechiali, and then joined the PhD program at the IEOR department of UC Berkeley, where he studied from 1981‚Äì1984. His PhD thesis was conducted under the supervision of Richard Karp and Ilan Adler.  Research  Early years Shamir started his research. * career in operations research, studying optimization problems related to linear programming and to the simplex method. His PhD thesis with Adler and Karp dealt with average case analysis of the Simplex Method, and showed that a certain Simplex variant was quadratic under a simple input data model. Similar results were given at the same time by Michael Todd and by Adler and Nimrod Megiddo. He later worked with Dorit S. Hochbaum on efficient algorithms for structured optimization problems.  Algorithmic Graph Theory  In the early 1990s, Shamir turned his focus to algorithmic graph theory. Together with his student, Haim Kaplan, and Martin Golumbic, he studied graph sandwich problems, graph completion problems and a variety of problems related to interval graphs. One of his papers on the interval satisfiability problem was later applied to the study of DNA physical mapping; this marked his introduction to the field of computational biology.  Bioinformatics  Shamir used his expertise in graph theory to develop clustering algorithms for analyzing gene expression problems. His first paper in this area, with Erez Hartuv, introduced the HCS clustering algorithm. His CAST algorithm, with Zohar Yakhini and Amir Ben-Dor was published in 1999 and drew a lot of attention from the bioinformatics community; the techniques described in the paper became popular for analyzing genomic data. The CLICK clustering algorithm with Roded Sharan and the SAMBA algorithm with Amos Tanay and Roded Sharan for biclustering are in broad use. Shamir broadened his research to include additional aspects of bioinformatics, such as analysis of biological networks, genome rearrangements, sequence motif finding, and transcriptional regulation. Many tools developed in his laboratory are available as a part of the EXPANDER suite, which provides an integrated environment for analyzing high-throughput biological data. Shamir's current research focuses on integrative analysis of heterogeneous high- throughput bio-medical data, genome rearrangements in cancer, and gene regulation.  Additional Activities  Shamir was on the founding steering committee of the RECOMB meeting,RECOMB steering committee, including former member Ron Shamir. Accessed January 12, 2014 the premier theoretical conference in bioinformatics, and served on it for thirteen years.

The name comes from the first letters of the founders - Felix Yussoupov and Irina Romanova.  History  Founded in Paris in 1924, it occupied the entire ground floor, and later the first floor, of a house located at 10 rue Duphot. Almost the entire staff consisted of a couple of friends of the Yussoupov and other Russian immigrants. As models, there were not only girls especially hired for this purpose, but also Irina Alexandrovna with some of her friends. The presentation of the first collection was held at the H√¥tel Ritz on Place Vend√¥me and impressed the high society of Paris. Over the first weeks after the opening, Maison IRFƒí rapidly gained famed, mainly due to the public interest of Felix Yussoupov and rumors concerning his person. In his memoirs, he mentions that the client \\"came out of curiosity and for the excitement\\". Another requested a tea from a samovar and one American lady wanted to see \\"the Prince, which is rumored to have phosphorescent eyes, like a predator!\\" This first successful business experience encouraged Felix Yussoupov to open a porcelain shop, together with Baron Edmond de Zyuilanom, in 1925 on rue Richepanse, nearby Maison IRFƒí. Later, the prince took part in decorating the Parisian restaurant Maisonette on rue du Mont-Thabor, in a \\"Russian style\\", and opened the restaurant Lido; the maker of the interiors was painter Shukhaiev. In 1925, Maison IRFƒí opened a first branch in Le Touquet, where Irina Alexandrovna‚Äôs cousin ‚Äì Prince Gabriel Constantinovich and his wife, Antonina Rafailovna Nesterovskaya, former ballerina of the Imperial Ballet ‚Äì took care of the business. Then, it subsequently opened two more branches in London on Berkeley Street, under the leadership of a certain Mrs Ensil and in Berlin, in a house on Parizerplatts Radziwill. In 1926, IRFƒí launched its own perfume line. It was limited and conceived in four flavors: Blonde for blondes, Brunette for brunettes, Titiane for red-haired women and Grey Silver for women of an elegant age. In 1931, Maison IRFƒí and all its branches closed down for economic reasons. The perfume venture remained for a few years longer in the atelier.  Present day  After a 90-year break, IRFƒí fashion house was restored to life by its new owner Olga Sorokina. Maison IRFƒí‚Äôs design studio and headquarters are currently located in Paris on rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor√©. The House offers high-end ready-to-wear clothing garments and accessories, made in French and Italian ateliers. Maison IRFƒí made its debut fashion show during Paris Fashion Week in September 2013, also as this year celebrates the 400th anniversary of the Romanov dynasty.

His son, George Jennings, commissioned Richard Woods to lay out the park in 1763. The main house went on to become the family home of Field Marshal Lord Strathnairn in the early 1880s. Strathnairn was keen on horses and had an obelisk erected in memory of his favourite charger which he had ridden during the Indian Mutiny. Sir Humphrey de Trafford, a prominent racehorse owner, acquired the house in 1926 and lived there with his family until the house burnt down during the Second World War. De Trafford had a new house built and continued to live on the estate, breeding famous racehorses including Alcide, who won the 1958 St. Leger Stakes and the 1959 King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, and Parthia, who won the 1959 Epsom Derby, until his death in 1971. The estate continues to operate as an active horse stud and, since 2000, has been owned by Jacobs Holding AG.

Biography  Clerici was a complex and eclectic artist and was also an architect, costume designer, scenographer and photographer. His works were exhibited in many museums in the United States, including the MoMA and the Guggenheim Museum, and in France, such as the Centre Pompidou. His most renowned works are Il Minotauro accusa pubblicamente sua madre, Sonno romano (1955); Le Confessioni palermitane (1954); Minerva phlegraea (1956‚Äì57); Le Krak des Chevaliers (1968). In 1920 Clerici moved to Rome, where he studied at the Scuola Superiore di Architettura, and obtained an architecture degree in 1937. The Roman monuments, architecture and paintings from the Italian Renaissance and the baroque period considerably influence him, as did certain religious works, due to their spectacular aspect. Later, Sonno romano (1955) would reawaken those memories. In Rome he attended conferences by Le Corbusier, and in 1936 he became a friend of Alberto Savinio; they admired each other's work.Savinio, Ascolto il tuo cuore citt√† (1944) In 1938 he met Giorgio de Chirico in Milan. At the end of the 1930s he made his first dreamlike and fantastic paintings, based on his memory of events, locations and persons transformed by the filter of time. Through his reconstruction of images, Clerici evolved naturally towards surrealism. However, the actual motive of Clerici remained metaphysical. Upon his return to Rome after the Second World War he closely perused the scientific studies of Athanasius Kircher, Erhard Sch√∂n and Jean Fran√ßois Niceron. In 1944 he wrote an article in the review Quadrante describing his meeting with Leonor Fini. In January 1945 he and Savinio participated in a collective exhibition. In 1947 he collaborated with Lucio Fontana in the project Patio per una casa al mare, for Handicraft Development, Inc. in New York. Until 1948, Clerici continued to produce drawings and engravings; in 1949 he produced large-scale paintings in which architecture was the major harmonic component. Later he travelled to the Middle East ‚Äî Egypt, Syria and Jordan ‚Äî as well as to Libya and Turkey. From those travels Clerici developed two themes: the \\"mirages\\" and the \\"temples of the egg\\", cycles of constructions set in the desert and spiralling from a central core containing a hypothetical primordial egg. In parallel to his paintings, which became more and more fantastic and magical, he worked for the theatre. On this return from Egypt he created sets for La vedova scaltra by Carlo Goldoni under the direction of Giorgio Strehler. Before that he had produced the sets of a number of ballets and lyric works, always with the theme of a fantastic world. He then made the sets and costumes for Igor Stravinsky's ballet Orpheus, presented at the La Fenice theatre in Venice in 1948; for Dido and Aeneas by Henry Purcell and for The Rape of Lucretia by Benjamin Britten, both at the Teatro dell'Opera di Roma and directed by Alberto Lattuada (1949); for Armide by Jean-Baptiste Lully (1950); for the comic opera Gianni Schicchi by Giacomo Puccini, directed by Peter Ustinov at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden (1962); and for Ali Baba by Luigi Cherubini, at the La Scala in Milan. Over a two-year period he helped create the big stained glass window La fede di Santa Caterina for the Basilica of San Domenico in Siena (1957). In 1964 he began a series of tables for Orlando furioso of Ludovico Ariosto. In 1968, on the occasion of the Berliner Festspiele, he participated in two exhibitions on painting and scenography in the Neue Nationalgalerie and the Galerie im Rathaus Tempelhof. In 1970 he produced for Berlin's Propyl√§en Verlag an edition of The Travels of Marco Polo (Il Milione) of Marco Polo, with tables and original lithographs. The drawings were exhibited with other paintings at the Galerie Brusberg in Hanover (1971). In 1974-75 he painted a cycle around the theme Isle of the Dead of Arnold B√∂cklin. In 1977 he made a series of lithographs for an edition of Le bestiaire by Guillaume Apollinaire. During the same year three important retrospective exhibitions were dedicated to Clerici at the Museum of Western and Oriental Art in Kiev, the Fine Arts Museum in Almaty and the Pushkin Museum in Moscow. In the 1970s he produced Egyptian-inspired works entitled Variazioni tebane. In 1980‚Äì1981 he completed a cycle of paintings around the theme of violence, entitled I corpi di Orvieto. At the same time he worked on a series of large colour tables entitled Le impalcature della Sistina. In 1983 an exhibition was dedicated to him at the Palazzo dei Diamanti in Ferrara. In 1984, he visited Samarkand and Bukhara. In 1987 a retrospective exhibition was dedicated to him at the Reggia di Caserta, with a catalogue edited by Franco Maria Ricci. After his death the Archivio \\"Fabrizio Clerici\\" was created.  Bibliography  *Giuseppe Bergamini, Giancarlo Pauletto. Fabrizio Clerici: opere 1938‚Äì1990.

He played several matches for each against East Sussex, the Players of Sussex, and various Gentlemen teams of Surrey and Hampshire throughout 1839 and 1840. He was invited to first play for Sussex on 14 June 1841 against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's. On his debut he was dismissed for scores of four and one, batting in the lower order. Smith would face the MCC once more that year, in August at Brighton, before waiting a whole year for his next first-class match. He played, again for Sussex, on 29 August 1842 against an England XI where he was dismissed by William Hillyer for ten. Smith's activities for the next two years are unrecorded, and he does not feature on a cricket scorecard until June 1844, where he played three matches against East sussex and the Gentlemen of Hampshire. He joined Henfield Cricket Club and featured for them against Brighton that year also. In May 1845 he played for Petworth Cricket Club against the MCC, followed by Hampshire and then the MCC once more - all first-class games. He played a Gentlemen v Players game in September 1845, an early County cricket matches in 1851 between Sussex and Kent, and faced the All England XI in 1852 followed by two more outings against Kent.

Brattingsborg castle shared its name with the manor house Brattingsborg (Brattingsborg Gods). To distinguish the two, the former castle is commonly referred to as Old Brattingsborg (Gammel Brattingsborg). History The castle was erected at some point in the 12th century but destroyed and burned down in a battle led by the outlawed Stig Andersen Hvide in the year 1289. After its destruction, the crown decided to construct the castle of Vesborg on the south coast. The only remains of Brattingsborg are the earth-mounds of the castle hill along with traces of its double-moat defences and foundations. The castle hill was thoroughly investigated by archaeologists from the National Museum of Denmark and Moesg√•rd Museum in 2008, as part of a larger project, concerning all of Sams√∏'s five medieval castles. They collaborated with Sams√∏ Museum and the Cultural Heritage agency. The excavations revealed remains of a former church (25 m long and 8.5 m wide), inside the castle grounds and suggests, that the church caught fire in the violent conflict of 1289, but that it was in use for some years after and then superseded by Tranebjerg Church just 100 m away. There were hints of an even older wooden church at the site and it was clear from the start, that the castle hill had been important since at least the Bronze Age, as Brattingsborg itself was founded on a barrow from that period.

In the designation stands S for Standard, G for Goods. It was by number of built locomotives one of the largest steam locomotive classes built in United Kingdom. The design originated from a BESA standard. History With the growing demand for locomotives in the British Raj it became for the British industry more and more difficult to deliver the required amount. To speed up delivery the British Engineering Standards Association (BESA) was chartered to develop standard locomotive types. The first BESA report issued in 1903 contained a design recommendation for a 4-4-0 standard passenger locomotive called SP and one for a 0-6-0 standard goods locomotive called SG. Revised versions proposed eight classes of broad gauge locomotives and four classes of meter gauge locomotives for various services. These locomotives were later called BESA locomotives. The SG class was used by the North Western State Railway (NWR), the Eastern Bengal Railway (EBR), the East Indian Railway (EIR) and the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway (ORR) of Indian State Railways, not only in front of goods trains, but also often in front of passenger trains. They could haul 1450 tons of freight with a speed of . Some locomotives were in service in India until the early 1980s and in Pakistan until the 1990s. Technical variants A later built variant with Schmidt superheater was called class SGS, where the designation stands for 'Standard Goods Locomotive, Superheated'. Compared to the wet steam version, the locomotives received larger cylinders with piston valves and larger boilers, as well as a four-axle tender with bogies. Locomotives delivered as SG class, which were later converted to superheated locomotives were allocated to the class SGC, where the C stands for 'converted'. The class SGSC, later called SGC2, had round fireboxes instead of the Belpaire firebox of the initial version. SGC3 class locomotives were not only retrofitted with super-heaters and but received also a Lentz rotary valve gear. The 2nd class of standard goods converted locomotives, abbreviated as SGSC and later as SGC2, was another variant distinguished by round fireboxes. Despite its classification, they were used for hauling passenger and mail trains frequently. There was also a class SG1 with unknown characteristics.

The route was only long and connected the former U.S. Route 21 (US 21), US 50 Alternate, and SR 7 in downtown Marietta with SR 375 near the northern limits of the city. Route description SR 326 began at the intersection of Washington and 3rd Streets in downtown Marietta. Throughout the existence of SR 326, 3rd Street carried US 21, US 50 Alternate, and SR 7 (it now has SR 7 and SR 60). SR 326 headed northeast along Washington Street through a residential neighborhood. Towards the end of its run on Washington Street and adjacent to the Oak Grove Cemetery, the route began climbing a hill. The route made a sharp hairpin turn and climbed an even steeper hill towards the Emerson Heights neighborhood. At the top of the hill, SR 326 wound its way around the tops of adjacent hills before ending at Glendale Road which was at the time SR 375. History This SR 326 is not related to another SR 326 that was previously signed for about two years in Lucas County. The road that became SR 326 was part of the state highway system by 1935 but was not designated as such on the official Ohio state maps until 1946. The route had been asphalt-paved since its inclusion into the state highway system. The route was one of many short state highways in the Marietta area which included SR 351 and SR 375. SR 326 would not experience any major changes until the late 1960s, around the time Interstate 77 was completed through the area. By 1969, SR 326 was removed from the state highway system.

The widely unibilicate, rather thin shell has a turbinate shape. Its colour is pale yellow, with purple disposed in dots on the shoulder and stripes on the base. The five whorls are tabulate above, angled at the shoulder, thence rounded, last in slight contact with its predecessor. The sutures are impressed. Sculpture: the flat sutural shelf of the upper whorls is ornamented by fine regular radial riblets. Obliquely descending the slope, these riblets crenulate the upper spirals and gradually vanish on the body whorl into faint irregularly spaced growth lines. On the upper whorls are five spiral cords, between which are smaller threads, in their turn separating still finer lines. The body whorl is encircled by ten strong keels whose interstices are occupied by small and smaller threads as before. The apex is elevated and consists of two small and glossy whorls. The umbilicus is wide and deep, penetrated by five elevated spiral ridges beaded by longitudinal sculpture. The aperture is circular, slightly oblique. The peristome is entire, simple, and sharp, within brilliantly nacreous, nacre edged with a thin brown and a broader yellow non- nacreous margin. Hedley, C. 1903.

Career Carpenter, who is of Chickasaw ancestry, began playing music while in grade school in his home town of Ada, Oklahoma, with acoustic guitar as his primary instrument, adding bass guitar, drums, electric guitar, and the saxophone to his repertoire as his interests expanded. In 2007, he was invited by Mississippi Choctaw composer and flutist Brad Clonch to join him in playing Native American music for the Chickasaw Nation Hall of Fame induction ceremony. He and Clonch began playing shows around Oklahoma, adding other members to round out a band, which they dubbed \\"Injunuity\\".Carrie Buckley: \\"Rising Indian Band 'Injunuity' to perform in Europe\\", Chickasaw Times, March 2013, http://digital.turn- page.com/issue/20177/9, p. 10.Gene Lehmann: \\"Native band 'Injunuity' finds receptive listeners on Swiss tour\\", Chickasaw Times, September 2013, http://digital.turn-page.com/i/165957/17, p. 18. The group soon branched out to playing venues across the country, in Alabama, New Mexico, and Wisconsin.Native News Network Staff in Entertainment: Injunuity Signs CD Pact with Record Company, http://www.nativenewsnetwork.com/injunuity-signs-cd-pact- with-record-company.html, posted August 30, 2013. In July 2013, they headlined the 5th annual Apache Moon Festival in Semione, Switzerland at the invitation of the concert's director. Injunuity's sound is based on a melding of Carpenter's and Clonch's backgrounds, combining traditional and modern themes, and string orchestra and piano with modern drums and electric guitar to cover several genres of music, from folk to Rock to Classical. Carpenter and Clonch primarily compose their own songs, utilizing digital recording to produce some of their more complex compositions. Clonch plays the Native American flute and keyboard and Carpenter lead guitar and alto sax, with James Monroe on trumpet, Robbie Blair on bass guitar, and Ashton Booth on drums. The group's most recent addition is vocals by Ada, Oklahoma native and Nashville, Tennessee recording artist Brittany Dawn. Since Native Americans in previous centuries didn‚Äôt have recording technology and many of their songs were lost, a primary goal of Injunuity is to help keep the musical aspect of Native American culture alive through the music of tribal instruments, as well as educating non-Natives about Native Americans and music within their culture.Chickasaw Arts & Humanities: Jeff Carpenter, Chickasaw Guitarist, http://www.chickasaw.tv/arts/document/jeff-carpenter-profile, accessed December 1, 2013.

It is best known for West Perth's record losing streak of twenty-seven matches up to the fifteenth round, an ignominy equalled by Peel Thunder in their formative years but never actually beaten. The Cardinals finished with the worst record since Midland Junction lost all twelve games in 1917, and were the first WANFL team with only one victory for twelve seasons. In their only win, champion forward Ted Tyson became the first West Australian to kick over one thousand goals and he just failed to replicate his 1938 feat of leading the goalkicking for a bottom club. Subiaco, despite a second Sandover win from Haydn Bunton (in spite of several problematic leg injuries) won only three matches, and Swan Districts, affected by the loss of star goalkicker Ted Holdsworth to Kalgoorlie,‚ÄòFootball: Holdsworth for ‚ÄòFields‚Äô; The Daily News, 10 January 1939, p. 8 began a long period as a cellar-dweller with a fall to sixth. Claremont, with captain George Moloney returning to the goalfront from the centre, won their second consecutive premiership despite the loss of many key players in the week before the Grand Final, whilst East Fremantle and East Perth remained firmly entrenched in the top and had a neck-and-neck battle late in the season for the double chance. Perth and South Fremantle, both of whom had had long periods in the wilderness, fought an exciting battle for the last place in the top four that ended with the red and whites winning by the narrowest of margins, in the process providing a basis for the club's dynasty following World War II, which began on the weekend of the penultimate round. Two key rule changes were made in the WANFL and nationally in 1939. The holding the ball rule was altered to eliminate the provision for a player to drop the ball when tackled, meaning that a player was forced to either kick or handpass the ball when tackled to avoid conceding a free kick; and, the boundary throw-in was reintroduced whenever the ball went out of bounds, except when put out deliberately, instead of a free kick being awarded against the last player to touch the ball, as had been the case since 1925.

The following is a list of characters that appeared in 2014, by order of first appearance. All characters were introduced by series producer Stuart Blackburn. Sharif Nazir (Marc Anwar), the father of established character Kal Nazir (Jimi Mistry), made his first appearance in February. Steph Britton's (Tisha Merry) brother, Luke Britton (Dean Fagan), and a new love interest for Gail McIntyre (Helen Worth), Michael Rodwell (Les Dennis), began appearing from March. Kal's daughter, Alya Nazir (Sair Khan), arrived in June, while Kal's mother and Sharif's wife, Yasmeen Nazir (Shelley King), turned up in July. In August, recurring character Dr. Susan Gaddas (Christine Mackie) made her first appearance, as well as Steve McDonald's (Simon Gregson) enemy, Dean Upton (Justin Moorhouse). Kal's son, Zeedan Nazir (Qasim Akhtar), joined in September, completing the Nazir family. Kylie Platt's (Paula Lane) old friends, Gemma Winter (Dolly-Rose Campbell) and Macca Hibbs (Gareth Berliner), appeared from October, as well as Callum Logan (Sean Ward), the father of Kylie's young son, Max Turner (Harry McDermott). Andy Carver (Oliver Farnworth) made his debut in November pretending to be Gavin Rodwell, Michael's long-lost son. New vicar and love interest for Sean Tully (Antony Cotton), Billy Mayhew (Daniel Brocklebank), and Erica Holroyd (Claire King), a friend of Liz McDonald (Beverley Callard) and love interest for Nick Tilsley (Ben Price), were introduced in December. Sharif Nazir Sharif Nazir, played by Marc Anwar, made his first screen appearance on 24 February 2014. The character and casting was announced on 13 January 2014. Sharif is the father of Kal Nazir (Jimi Mistry), who was introduced in December 2013, and will be part of the show's first Muslim family. The show's producer, Stuart Blackburn commented that he was \\"loving him on paper already\\" and added \\"Sharif retired some time ago. He isn't rich, but he'd made enough money. We imagine that there were some health problems and his wife said, 'Now you're no longer going to go to work 12 hours a day!'\\" He is Kal's father and the husband of Yasmeen Nazir (Shelley King). In August 2016, it emerged that Sharif has been having an affair for seven years with Sonia Rahman (Sudha Bhuchar). Anwar was fired from the show in September 2016 after he wrote a series of racist posts on Twitter. His character was written out and he departed off-screen. He made his last appearance on the episode aired 4 November 2016 when he was evicted by Yasmeen, after confessing his affair with Sonia. Luke Britton Luke Britton, played by Dean Fagan, made his first screen appearance on 3 March 2014. The character and casting was announced on 1 December 2013. Luke is the brother of established character Steph Britton (Tisha Merry) and was introduced as a replacement for Tommy Duckworth, after Chris Fountain was fired from the show for posting inappropriate videos online. Billed as \\"hunky\\", Luke is a mechanic, who finds employment at Kevin Webster's (Michael Le Vell) garage. His sister gets him the job after hearing about the open position. Colin Daniels from Digital Spy reported that Steph is \\"very protective\\" of Luke. During his review of the upcoming soap characters, Jon Horsley from Yahoo! TV said viewers should be excited for Luke's arrival, saying \\"Well, he's hunky, handy with a spanner and sure to stir things up. Let's just hope he doesn't start any online rapping.\\" Luke first arrives in Weatherfield to help his sister, Steph, move into the flat that was previously owned by her best friend Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan). Later, he starts work at the garage. Luke soon comforts Steph over Tina's death, with the help from her close friend Katy Armstrong (Georgia May Foote). He and Carla Connor (Alison King) get drunk and go back to her flat. She makes it clear she wants to sleep with him but he leaves as he does not want to take advantage. He later offers to have a word with Nick Tilsley (Ben Price) after he is nasty to Steph. He then begins a romantic relationship with Maria Connor (Samia Ghadie) but this comes to an end when, unknown to him, she sleeps with Aidan Connor (Shayne Ward). He begins seeing Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford). After he breaks up with Tracy, he begins a relationship with Alya Nazir (Sair Khan). The character made a surprise departure on 5 January 2018 when he became the latest murder victim of Pat Phelan (Connor McIntyre). He confronts Phelan over the disappearance of his best-friend and Steph's boyfriend: Andy Carver (Oliver Farnworth), unaware that Phelan had killed Andy after keeping him captive for nearly the entirety of 2017. When Phelan is unable to shake Luke of his suspicions, Luke grows to suspect Phelan is hiding something and intends to report Andy missing to the police. However, as Luke goes over to his car, Phelan sneaks up behind him and hits Luke over the head with a rock to stop him reporting his crime ‚Äî only for Luke to punch Phelan in response and knock him temporarily unconscious. Luke drives off in his car, but is pursued by Phelan; a car chase ensues between the duo that culminates with Phelan ramming Luke into a wall, injuring him. Unable to restart his car or escape it, Luke can only watch as Phelan menacingly approaches him with a gun. He shoots Luke with impact, then reverses his van into the rear side of Luke's broken car. There, Phelan indirectly confesses to killing Andy upon telling Luke that he's succeeded in finding him. As a dying Luke reels at this revelation whilst lying helpless in the vehicle, Phelan ‚Äî after apprising Luke to tell Andy \\"say hello from me\\" ‚Äî points the gun at the petrol tank and shoots it twice, triggering a huge explosion that kills Luke and destroys his vehicle. News of Luke's death becomes public knowledge the next day, although most of the residents of Weatherfield are unaware of Phelan's role in Luke's murder ‚Äî with the exception of Phelan's enemy Gary Windass (Mikey North), whom Luke had befriended during his time in Weatherfield, and former apprentice Seb Franklin (Harry Visinoni). Eventually, the truth was out when Gary and Seb sought to uncover the gun Phelan used to kill Luke ‚Äî only to end up uncovering Andy's body along with that of Phelan's ex-business partner, Vinny Ashford (Ian Kelsey); after hearing of this, Eileen realised that Seb was telling the truth about Luke and Phelan confesses to Luke's murder in the midst of emulating his crimes. The following morning, Tim told the Nazirs about Phelan killing Luke when news of his crimes became public knowledge. Luke's death would later be avenged when Phelan was murdered by his archenemy ‚Äî Gary's mother Anna Windass (Debbie Rush) ‚Äî at the conclusion of his lethal siege, during which he shot Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh) ‚Äî who in retaliation and in Luke's honor promised Phelan that she would say his murder came out as self- defense. Michael Rodwell Michael Rodwell (credited as \\"Intruder\\" in his first appearance), played by former Family Fortunes presenter Les Dennis, made his first screen appearance on 24 March 2014. The character and Dennis' casting were announced on 23 January 2014. Dennis began filming for the show on 27 January. Michael has been billed as a \\"petty criminal\\". His arrival saw him break into one of the street's households. Of his casting Dennis stated \\"I'm so thrilled to be joining the cast of Coronation Street. It has always been my favourite television programme. Mixing high drama with some of the best comedy on screen.\\" Producer Stuart Blackburn described securing the established television personality a \\"real coup\\" for the show. On 19 July 2016, it was announced that Dennis would be leaving the show later in the year to pursue other projects and that \\"Michael will have a dramatic exit\\". In August 2017, Dennis was longlisted for Best Exit at the Inside Soap Awards. The nomination did not progress to the viewer-voted shortlist. Michael first appears on the street in Gail McIntyre's (Helen Worth) house, pretending to be a gas man, who has come to the house to look at the \\"gas leak\\". He is revealed as a burglar and pushes Gail, causing her to fall over and Kylie Platt (Paula Lane) chases him out of the street, but he gets into his van and drives off, with Fiz Stape (Jennie McAlpine) failing to read his number plate as he drives away. Gail starts to become anxious when she is home alone due to the burglary and is helped by her son David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd), Kylie and mother Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls). Weeks later, Gail visits Michael in prison to ask him about why he tried to burgle her house. They gradually grow close and she begins to stick up for him in front of David and Kylie. Michael gets a job at a local garden centre, until he is sacked after Kylie and David interfere with his work by telling the garden centre manager about Michael's criminal past. Although the manager knew this, he still sacks Michael after Kylie causes a scene. The next day, Gail takes Michael to Street Cars and helps him get a job there, after he somewhat impresses Eileen Grimshaw (Sue Cleaver) and Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson). He is due to start work the next day, but David and Gail's other son Nick Tilsley (Ben Price) go to his flat and threaten him and tell him not to come back to Weatherfield and attempt to contact their mother ever again or go to work at Street Cars. Gail asks after him at the cab office, and employee Lloyd Mullaney (Craig Charles) tells her that Michael didn't turn up. Not knowing why Michael didn't turn up, Gail then visits the flat and demands that Michael apologise to Lloyd and Steve for letting them down. Reluctantly, he lies and says that working so close to her would be too much for him, as he has feelings for her. Gail then leaves the flat, sad that Michael feels that way. The day after, Nick accidentally lets slip that he knows where Michael is living, and Gail visits Michael again. Michael admits that Nick and David threatened him, and agrees to go to work the next morning, while Gail promises to sort her sons out. Steve then agrees to give Michael another chance. To show his gratitude towards Gail, Michael buys the Platts a new television, after Kylie's young son Max Turner (Harry McDermott) destroyed their last one. He tells Gail that the TV cost ¬£200, but when David later looks up the price on the internet, it says that it costs ¬£420. David then tries to convince Gail that Michael stole money in order to buy the television, but Gail will not listen to him. Michael then produces the receipt, proving he did buy the television, and also shows them a solicitors letter to prove where he got the money, after he received it from a deceased aunt's estate. David remains skeptical, but his suspicions are soon eclipsed by his much greater concerns about his sworn enemy: Max's biological father Callum Logan (Sean Ward). When Michael is sent a photo album of his son Gavin's (Mark Holgate), childhood by Gavin's mother and his ex-wife, Susan Meldrum (Meriel Scholfield), Gail tries to stop him from looking at the photo with help from Gavin's friend Andy Carver (Oliver Farnworth) - who is impersonating Gavin; however, they fail in this and Michael soon realizes that Andy isn't the real Gavin. However, Gail tells him that his real son has died in a car accident followed by a Heart Attack . Hurt and upset, Michael leaves Gail and temporarily lives at Eileen's house, much to the dismay of Gail, until a drunken kiss from Michael to Eileen leaves him collapsing and taken to hospital. Despite trying to keep their relationship a secret from Gail, Michael soon confesses leading to a fight on the street between Eileen and Gail. Unable to forgive Gail for keeping Andy and his son's death a secret, he later demands a divorce. Michael and Eileen later split up, and she begins a relationship with local builder Pat Phelan (Connor McIntyre). After a short absence from the street, Michael returns in July and reconciles with Gail. In mid-November, Michael learns that Phelan - whom he had been clashing with ever since he knew that Phelan had been wooing Eileen in an attempt to steal her from him - and his crooked business partner Vinny Ashford (Ian Kelsey) have been scamming the residents of Weatherfield over the last few months. On the day Eileen accepts Phelan's proposal, Michael seeks the help from Gail's neighbour Anna Windass (Debbie Rush) - who too resents Phelan; back when Michael first appeared on the street in 2014, Phelan raped Anna by blackmailing her into sleeping with him - which she reluctantly agreed to do in order to prevent Phelan for tormenting her son Gary Windass (Mikey North) and ex-boyfriend Owen Armstrong (Ian Puleston-Davies) during their disastrous business partnership. Anna initially refuses to help Michael as she wants nothing to do with Phelan, but later discovers the scam herself after unwittingly seizing Phelan's phone from her adoptive daughter Faye Windass (Ellie Leach). Working together against their shared enemy, Anna invites Phelan to her house to stall him so that Michael could infiltrate his office to obtain evidence against him. While Anna tries unsuccessfully to bribe Phelan in leaving Weatherfield, Michael heads down to the site office and extracts Phelan's fake passport for his getaway escape. Just as Michael is about to leave with the evidence, however, Phelan arrives at the last second with a crowbar. Michael tauntingly dismisses Phelan's theory that he could phone the police to have him arrested for breaking and entering, as Michael has already gotten proof that Phelan's \\"Calcutta Street\\" project is actually a scam, but the situation quickly grows tense when Phelan makes it clear to Michael that he now intents to kill him. After failing to persuade Phelan in giving himself up to the police, Michael throws a chair at him to escape. He makes a break for the exit just as Phelan gives chase, but Michael suddenly stops and ends up having another heart attack in front of Phelan - who coldly refuses to help him as he did once before. Meanwhile, Anna alerts her Gary of the situation and he heads down to confront Phelan, but does not notice a dying Michael succumbing to his heart attack and taking his last breath. Gail attempts to ring him, but it's too late - as Michael has died. Once all is settled, Phelan later finds Michael dead and silently bids him goodbye with a sign of the cross before walking away from his lifeless body. Eileen's son Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley) discovers Michael's body the following day. Michael is cremated off screen, and Gail scatters his ashes into a pond near to where they were planning to renew their vows. As time went on without Michael following his passing, Andy correctly suspected Phelan's role in his death and tried in vain to expose this ‚Äì but was consequently abducted and locked in a cellar of Phelan and Eileen's would-be new home for nearly the entirety of 2017; this ultimately ended with Phelan killing Andy after forcing him to execute Vinny, whom Andy ‚Äì in his last moments ‚Äì was manipulated into believing was responsible for Michael's death, not Phelan. In March 2018, just two months after Phelan had killed Andy's best friend Luke Britton (Dean Fagan) for gradually uncovering the true circumstances of the latter's \\"disappearance\\" ‚Äì thus preventing Luke from having the possibility of finding out the truth about both Michael and Vinny as well ‚Äì Eileen would learn that Michael was right about Phelan's involvement in his \\"Calcutta Street\\" flats scam development upon overhearing his confession during his argument with Michael's best-friend and co-worker: Tim Metcalfe (Joe Duttine) ‚Äì who himself, along with Anna and Gary, had correctly suspected Phelan's role in Michael's death. A few weeks later, the truth was eventually revealed when Gary and his sister's boyfriend Seb Franklin (Harry Visinoni) had unknowingly unearthed the bodies of Andy and Vinny during their attempt to uncover the gun that Phelan used to kill Luke. When Eileen discovers this and confronts Phelan in response, he confessed to watching Michael die of a heart attack - before going on to emulate the rest of his crimes. The following morning, Gail and her family were informed about Phelan causing Michael's death by the time his crimes became public knowledge in Weatherfield. Michael's death would soon be avenged when Phelan is killed by Anna at the conclusion of his lethal siege, during which he shot his own daughter Nicola Rubinstein (Nicola Thorp) and her neighbor Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh) - prior to the latter marrying her fianc√© and co-restaurant owner Robert Preston (Tristan Gemmill). Ironically, Phelan dies in the same way as Michael had died - with Anna and the rest of the street watching Phelan die without aiding him, more likely in retribution for Michael's death.

When Michael Rodwell (Les Dennis) tries to track down his estranged family via Facebook, a cousin of his gets in touch and tells him his father has died. Michael's paternal aunt Barbara Deakin (Beatrice Kelly) then visits him to explain that his father and her mother both died of a hereditary heart condition, meaning Michael could also be a carrier. A worried Michael tests positive for the condition and realises he has to find his long-lost son Gavin, as he is also potentially at risk. Michael finds an address for Gavin and leaves a note with his address and telephone number. \\"Gavin\\" contacts him and the two have an uneasy reunion. However, when Michael reveals the news about his heart condition, the man claiming to be Gavin is seen making a phone call, stating that he needs to find Gavin Rodwell urgently. The imposter, who is really Andy Carver manages to find some casual work at Nick's Bistro, owned by Nick Tilsley (Ben Price), the eldest son of Michael's girlfriend Gail McIntyre (Helen Worth). He asks for cash in hand, claiming his bank account has been frozen due to fraud, in order to continue hiding his identity. Steph Britton (Tisha Merry), who worked as a waitress there, becomes attracted to Andy; while he initially steers clear to avoid his lie going too far, Andy eventually asks her out. Meanwhile, Andy begins to genuinely like Michael and starts to feel more and more guilty. He continues to attempt to trace the real Gavin Rodwell, but has no luck. When Nick's estranged wife Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson) returns to her old job as Manager of the Bistro, she insists Andy is properly paid through the books, forcing him to steal Gavin's National Insurance number and to open a bank account in his name. However, when Steph unexpectedly visits Andy she catches him in the act. Andy confesses the truth to a horrified Steph, but manages to persuade her not to expose him, convincing her Michael's health would be at risk from such a shock. When Michael sees the two behaving oddly and overhears part of a conversation, he jumps to the conclusion that she is pregnant. Realising that it is a sensible explanation for their behaviour, Andy tells Michael its true, but later told an enthusiastic Michael (who was looking forward to becoming a grandad, and even went as far as buying a t-shirt saying \\"top grandad\\" and baby clothes) that it was a false alarm. When Steph visits Andy at his flat, she is surprised to find a man she doesn't know there, before realising that it must be the real Gavin. She warns Andy to hide any evidence of what he's done, but before he can, Gavin finds a bank statement for an account in his name with regular payments from Nick's Bistro. Andy initially claims he used Gavin's name to avoid his wages being swallowed up by his overdraft, but Gavin is unconvinced, and Andy eventually admits the truth, begging Gavin to keep quiet due to Michael's health. Gavin, still bitter about being abandoned by his father, has no interest in sparing his feelings, but offers to stay quiet for ¬£5,000. A desperate Andy and Steph fake a mugging when Andy is entrusted with banking the Bistro's takings, but it isn't enough, so Gavin carries out his threat to expose Andy, by visiting Gail on her wedding day. The drama leads a stunned Gail to miss the wedding and, when she later furiously confronts Andy and Steph, she reveals Gavin is now blackmailing her. Gail reluctantly pays Gavin off and agrees to keep Andy's secret to avoid upsetting Michael. Much to Andy's relief, Gavin plans to leave the UK with his money. However, Andy is stunned to receive a phone call the next day telling him that Gavin has been killed in a car crash, apparently drunk behind the wheel. When Gail hears the news she tells Andy they have to keep it from Michael, telling him that to all intents and purposes, he now IS Gavin in Michael's eyes. However, the deception proves too much for Gail, especially after Barbara visits, having heard of Gavin's death, and reveals Gavin actually died of a heart attack. Gail attends Gavin's funeral in Michael's place, claiming he is too ill to go himself, but her guilt leads her to frequently visit Gavin's grave ‚Äì something her younger son David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd) later discovers. When Gail tells him the truth, he uses this information to blackmail Andy; forcing him to plant drugs on his enemy Callum Logan (Sean Ward). Andy gets caught, but David takes the rap. However, the stress is too much for Steph, who ends their relationship. Steph's brother Luke Britton (Dean Fagan) is furious to see her upset and threatens to confront Andy, leading Steph to tell Luke the truth. When Luke next sees Andy he confronts him anyway, but Steph persuades him to keep the secret. At Gail and Michael's rescheduled wedding, Andy makes a heartfelt speech about how close he has grown to Michael and how pleased he is to see him happy. Steph hears something in his words that makes her think it is a goodbye speech, her suspicions later proving true when she goes to Andy's flat and finds him packed his things and ready to leave. However, he tells Steph he cannot bear to leave her. Andy's secret comes out when Michael receives a photo album from his ex-wife, containing photos of the real Gavin. Michael eventually forgives him and they form a close surrogate father-son relationship, and Andy is left heartbroken when Michael dies of a heart attack whilst being watched by Pat Phelan (Connor McIntyre); whose property development scam Michael was investigating. Suspecting Phelan's involvement, an irate Andy strikes Phelan over the head with a brick, putting him in a coma. While he is recovering in hospital, Andy tries to poison Phelan's drink. Once Phelan realises this, he punishes Andy by blackmailing him into stealing money from the Bistro and burning down Kevin Webster's (Michael Le Vell) garage. Unable to withstand Phelan's blackmail any longer, Andy and Steph plan to flee Weatherfield for Portugal on Phelan's wedding day to Eileen Grimshaw (Sue Cleaver). When Phelan visits Andy to bid him farewell shortly after Steph leaves early, Andy records Phelan confessing to being present at Michael's death. Phelan realises this and hits Andy with the laptop containing incriminating evidence of Phelan confessing to his crimes. Phelan later sends a text to Steph from Andy's mobile phone and tells her that their relationship is over, so Steph leaves the country alone. Phelan keeps Andy chained to a wall in the basement of an abandoned house. Desperate to be freed, Andy comes up with a plan to get a replacement for him, which he would keep hostage, meaning he would earn his freedom and although initially reluctant, Phelan gets his former business partner Vinny Ashford (Ian Kelsey) for Andy to keep hostage. However, Phelan changes his mind and tells Andy to kill Vinny instead. He drives them both to an abandoned building and manipulates Andy into shooting Vinny dead. Andy aims the gun at Phelan, but then gives it to him. Andy realises that Phelan is going to kill him too, and ‚Äì rather than fight Phelan ‚Äì accepts his fate before Phelan pulls the trigger. Phelan apologises to Andy for killing him, before dumping his body along with Vinny's, into a lake. Phelan confesses to Eileen that he abducted and killed Andy. He is later killed by Anna Windass (Debbie Rush). Billy Mayhew Billy Mayhew, played by Daniel Brocklebank, made his first screen appearance on 5 December 2014.

Billy steels himself and explains to Sean that as he's still very much the new vicar, he does not yet want his congregation to know that he's gay. Sean is hurt and decides not to go along. Sean takes his temper out on Emily, calling her a bigot for not supporting Billy, just as the man himself walks in.

When Neil discovers the truth, Andrea leaves him for Lloyd and he tries to win her back. Neil returns home after three months working on his engineering job in Nigeria with presents for Andrea. Behind his back, she looks torn. Andrea tells Neil she has to go into work to cover for absent staff, even though he wants her to spend the day with him. Neil tells her he's postponed his return to Nigeria so they can spend more time together and suggests they visit their daughter Jess in Liverpool. Andrea makes her excuses and leaves him alone. Andrea arrives home to a cooked meal from Neil but makes her excuses to go to bed early and avoid him. Taking a breather outside The Rovers Return Inn, Andrea is startled when Neil arrives unannounced to join her. She manages to walk him away off home before Lloyd comes out, puzzled as to where she has got to. Andrea plucks up her courage and tells Neil she's leaving him but doesn't tell him about Lloyd. Steve is stunned to hear that Andrea is married. Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh) tells him that Andrea's gone to tell Neil that it's over between them and, if she doesn't, Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) will have to tell Lloyd himself. As Andrea prepares to leave, Neil asks her to wait and talk some more. Lloyd and Steve arrive at Andrea's address ‚Äì only to find it isn't: she gave Lloyd a false address.

As Andrea packs the last of her things, Neil begs her to give him another chance but her mind is made up. Andrea turns up in the Street and begs Steve to listen to her side of the story. She breaks down and Steve hugs her, watched from a distance by Neil who has followed her. He then follows Steve into The Rovers and listens in to him talking about the StreetCars business. Steve picks up a fare ‚Äì it is Neil. Neil doesn't tell Steve who he is. He unnerves Steve with his responses at attempts at conversation. Neil quizzes Steve about his private life. Steve loses his temper and asks him to leave the cab. Neil does so, making a passing comment about \\"friendly\\" cabbies. Lloyd refuses to talk to Andrea when she accosts him in the street. Again, Steve comforts her and she grabs onto his words of comfort as an offer to spend the night in The Rovers as she has nowhere else to go. Neil watches them talking together. Neil makes enquiries of Owen Armstrong (Ian Puleston-Davies) and Gary Windass (Mikey North) if Steve is married. Andrea finds Neil in the ginnel who says he knows she has another man. He enters The Rovers through the back door and to Andrea's horror, confronts Steve, accusing him of having an affair with his wife. Lloyd steps forward and explains to Neil that he's the \\"other man\\", not Steve. Lloyd explains to Neil that Andrea has been lying to both of them and he never wants to see her again. He also makes it clear to Steve that he's not happy that he has given Andrea shelter. Neil turns up at the locked cab office but Steve sees him off and enters with his own key. Neil tries to get into the back of the pub to see Andrea but Eva Price (Catherine Tyldesley) tells him she's gone out. Neil tells Lloyd that Andrea has gone missing and no one has heard from her.

Neil tells Andrea he'll do anything to make her happy. Lloyd worries he'll get through to her. Neil accepts defeat and takes Andrea for one last drink. Andrea is dismayed when her drink with Neil turns into yet another attempt to talk her round, as he reminds her of happier times. Lloyd wonders where Neil and Andrea are. Andrea spells it out to Neil that she hasn't loved him for ages and is running out of pity for him. Lloyd marches into the Bistro to send Neil packing. Andrea is annoyed when he causes a scene but relieved when Neil leaves. Andrea is creeped out when she sees Neil hanging around outside Lloyd's flat. Lloyd tries to see him off but Neil announces his intention to remain day and night until Andrea changes her mind. Steve and Lloyd are puzzled when StreetCars receives fake call-outs and a load of pizzas they didn't order. Neil casually lets them know he's behind it. Neil pesters Andrea with texts. Steve suggests Lloyd play Neil at his own game. Steve and Lloyd observe from afar as a clown they've ordered calls at Neil's house for a non-existent child's party. They're surprised when Neil invites him in. Neil tells Steve and Lloyd their plan backfired as he and the clown are kindred spirits. He passes on a message to Andrea that her mother is in hospital. Lloyd and Andrea decide to have a picnic in The Rovers' yard. Neil watches them from his car. Neil interrupts Lloyd and Andrea's picnic and settles down with a pint to watch them.

Lloyd is furious to see a notice in the Gazette placed by Neil celebrating his and Andrea's anniversary. Steve lets slip to Neil that Lloyd and Andrea are at the bistro. Neil takes a table next to Lloyd and Andrea at the Bistro. From the adjoining table, Neil chats constantly to Lloyd and Andrea and even buys them all champagne. Lloyd can't take Neil's presence anymore and offers to take him outside but Andrea calms him down. Andrea tells Neil she wants a divorce. Neil begs Andrea not to divorce him. She's worried he'll do something to himself and decides to check on him but Lloyd insists on going instead in case it's a ploy to talk her round. Lloyd lets himself into Neil's house and finds him in a chirpy mood, clearly expecting Andrea. Lloyd notices Neil has set candles and wine and threatens to call the police if he bothers Andrea again. The police call at Lloyd's flat and bring him in for questioning as Neil has accused him of harassment. Lloyd is aggrieved when the police tell him to stay away from Neil. Neil appears to taunt Lloyd and Andrea and tells them he's going to make sure they're never happy together. Lloyd and Andrea are annoyed to see Neil in the caf√©. Andrea tries a different tactic ‚Äì being nice to him, and Lloyd joins in. Neil tells Andrea he knows what she's doing but it won't work ‚Äì he's going to be her shadow until she sees the error of her ways. Lloyd chats to Michelle about her wedding planning service and asks her hypothetically what services she would provide for him and Andrea. Neil overhears them and thinks they are actual plans.

Neil refuses to come down until the engagement is broken. He doesn't believe their excuses. Neil refuses to come down until Andrea comes back to him. She climbs up the ladder to talk to him and tells him she's never coming home. Andrea slips and Liz tells Lloyd and Dev to get Andrea in through the window but they can't get her into position to pull her in. Neil tells her to trust him and manages to pull her on to the roof. Neil is upset that he almost lost Andrea but he accepts now she loves Lloyd. The police and fire brigade arrive to rescue Andrea and Neil. He asks her to remember him as he once was, when they were happy. They are brought down and Lloyd goes for Neil who is taken away by the police as Kevin Webster (Michael Le Vell) and Kal Nazir (Jimi Mistry) get Tim down. Lloyd is confident he and Andrea have seen the last of Neil, but he turns up to say the police have let him off with a caution and he's leaving the country for good. Neil tells Lloyd and Andrea he's seen the light and is truly sorry. Lloyd is so eager to get rid of him that he drives him to the airport free of charge. - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   25 June  Jessica Forrest  Siobhan and her friend Alya Nazir (Sair Khan) meet Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) and Gary Windass (Mikey North) in a club.

It was based on Moody's self-published novel Autumn. Fletcher plays a schoolteacher who must survive in a post-apocalyptic world inhabited by evolving zombies.  Premise  After a viral outbreak kills 99% of the world's population, scattered survivors come together and attempt to deal with the collapse of civilization. They face a new threat when the dead begin to reanimate. Initially catatonic, the corpses slowly regain their senses, become increasingly sensitive to outside stimuli, and show signs of aggression. Eventually, the survivors must fortify themselves against attack and try to find a reason to survive.  Cast   Production  Author David Moody had offers on two of his novels, Autumn and Hater, at the same time. Although Hater had Guillermo Del Toro attached, Moody reasoned that Autumn, as a small independent film, had a greater chance of being made. Moody made both deals and participated in the making of Autumn.  Release  Autumn played at the 2009 Grimm Up North Festival in the UK.  Reception  The film drew mixed to negative reviews. Reviewing the film while it was still in post-production, Brutal As Hell wrote that the atmosphere and settings of the film are better than other low budget post-apocalyptic films. Sabrina Bangladesh of Shadowlocked.com wrote that the film is too boring to be \\"so bad it's good\\". Mark L. Miller of Ain't It Cool News called it \\"a thinking man's zombie flick with some fun performances and decent effects.\\" Writing in The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, Volume 2, academic Peter Dendle called the film \\"a patient meditation\\" with a \\"mournful, serious tone\\" and \\"rich aesthetic to many of the scenes.\\" David Moody, the author of the source novel, said, \\"Ultimately, although it has some redeeming qualities, and the main cast did a great job, I think it was a disappointment to a lot of people. The filmmakers were really stretched by having to work within a microscopic budget, and there are places where that really shows.\\" The mostly negative reception of Autumn led Dexter Fletcher to direct his own films, which were better received.

The origins of the strike lay in the decision of the employers to impose a wage reduction of up to 20%, as a result of the general depression in trade in the aftermath of the Crimean War. During the dispute a trade union appeared amongst the miners of the Aberdare Valley but the men were ultimately forced to return to work on the terms set by the owners. Origins of the Dispute During the autumn of 1857 it was widely rumoured that the coal owners were intending to impose a substantial reduction in wages. Amongst the miners there was a general recognition that some reduction was inevitable and a delegate meeting agreed to send a delegation to local coal owners to argue for a limited reduction. This conciliatory approach was supported by some influential local middle- class figures, most notably Thomas Price, influential minister of Calfaria, Aberdare and also editor of the Welsh language newspaper, Y Gwron (which was published at Aberdare). However, when the masters refused to negotiate, the miners rejected the conciliatory advice of Price and came out on strike. The Dispute In the early phase of the strike, there were rumours of some violence and intimidation, largely towards those engineers who were maintaining the pits in working order. It appears that the engineers succeeded in doing so at all pits, apart from that at the Shepherds Pit, Cwmaman, where the engineers themselves joined the dispute. In this tense atmosphere, soldiers were sent to Aberdare. Having initially been lodged at the Town Hall, the redcoats were removed to Cardiff when fears of disorder subsided. This appears to have resulted from the intervention of the local Member of Parliament, Henry Austen Bruce. In general, however, the dispute was a peaceful one and was characterised by the emergence of a trade union movement, and the Merthyr Telegraph, in particular, was critical of other newspapers in Cardiff and Swanase which it accused of wildly exaggerating the extent of disorder at Aberdare. The coal owners of the district, in contrast to the iron masters, were, in the main, self-made Welsh entrepreneurs whose relationship with their workmen were generally good. Men such as David Williams (Alaw Goch) now found themselves in the unfamiliar position of being opposed by their employees. In a letter to the Merthyr Telegraph, Williams rejected the claims made by the miners that there was no reduction in the price of steam coal. He did not blame the men for seeking to sustain their wages but did allude to the threats being made, including flooding the mines. Public Meetings at Aberdare, December 1857 Henry Austin Bruce, MP for the Merthyr Boroughs, was the employers' main spokesman during the dispute, and addressed meetings at Mountain Ash and Aberdare to present the masters' case to large crowds of workmen. At a public meeting at Aberdare, held in the Market Hall, he callied on the colliers to return to work. In his speech, Bruce recognised that his family had extensive interests in the coal industry but he also claimed that he wished to play a conciliating role in terminating the strike. In the course of a lengthy speech, Bruce argued that the owners were acting reasonably in reducing wages in view of the general economic climate and the condition of both the coal and iron trades in the district. At this meeting, a very large attendance was reported, and a press report stated that no attempt at interruption occurred at any point. Bruce's speech was translated, for the benefit of those who did not speak Welsh, by the Rev David Price of Siloa, Aberdare. The meeting is significant due to the fact that a number of working men involved with the leadership of the strike spoke, or were invited to speak. These included David Williams, John Jones (Gwalch) and John Davies of Blaengwawr. While his first speech was relatively conciliatory, Bruce then launched into an attack on the miners' claims and compared their demands with the income that farm labourers in Carmarthenshire and Glamorgan could expect. He referred to the extremism allegedly engendered by trade unionism elsewhere and referred to alleged examples of intimidation and violence in the locality. Significantly, these comments were translated by Thomas Price of Calfaria, Aberdare, who was followed by his fellow minister David Price relating his own experience as a striking miner many years before. The apparent understanding between Bruce and these prominent nonconformist ministers reflects the antipathy of the chapel leadership towards trade unionism. According to one report, Thomas Price proceeded to add some remarks of his own, seeking to induce the men to return to work. His behaviour at this meeting would later be recalled during the 1868 General Election in the constituency, when Bruce was defeated. It was estimated that, by the time of this meeting, around 6,500 miners were on strike and press reports refer both to the peaceful nature of the dispute and the strangely quiet atmosphere in the normally bustling Aberdare Valley. Furnaces that had remained lit uninterrupted for twenty years were extinguished and, at night, the main source of light was the illumination caused by the ironworks at Merthyr in the neighbouring valley. On 14 December, two days after the meeting at Aberdare, a mass meeting of miners (some 10,000 according to one press report) was held on Hirwaun Common. In contrast to the meeting at the Market Hall, this demonstration was addressed by miners' leaders only. One of their number, Lewis Morgan, claimed that the miners' were being misled in relation to price of coal at Cardiff and that the proposed reductions in wages were well in excess of what the condition of trade could justify. Other press reports expressed some sympathy with the claims made by the men about advances in wages not having been granted when the price of coal was increasing. There were also significant references to grievances about the introduction of machinery which cut across traditional methods of cutting coal. The Baptist journal, Seren Cymru, emphasised the peaceful nature of this demonstration at Hirwaun in particular. End of the Dispute By mid December some of those who had shown sympathy with the men had changed their view. On 12 January a meeting was held at Mountain Ash, which strikers from the Monmouthshire valleys were expected to attend. However, it transpired that false rumours had been carried to Monmouthshire intimating that the strike was over at Aberdare. In consequence of the non-appearance of the Monmouthshire delegates, divisions among the men were made apparent. An old collier urged the men to return to work but the majority dissented. It emerged that some threatening notices had been posted in the valley at this time, reminiscent of earlier industrial disputes in South Wales, most notably the Scotch Cattle in the Monmouthshire Valleys in the 1820s.. The most notable example was a letter allegedly sent by Y Tarw [The Bull] which began: To my faithful Brethren in the strike. I am very thankful to all of you for your valuable services in assisting me in my present troubles. Be faithful for a little while yet, and we will win the day. The letter then proceeded to make vague threats of violence. At a meeting held at the Market Place in Aberdare, John Jones (Gwalch) explicitly denied being the author of this letter Another meeting was held at Hirwaun Common where it was reported that several of the coal-owners had brought in workers from elsewhere to replace those on strike. Coal trimmers from Cardiff were said to be engaged at mountain Ash while thirty colliers from Pembrokeshire were reported to be at Cwmpennar, although they appeared to have refused to work after realising the circumstances. Eventually the men were forced to return to work on the employers' terms and the episode had a later significance in the history of the valley and parliamentary constituency. It has been argued that the religious revival of 1859 which had a considerable impact upon the town was at least partly instigated by the coal owners in their attempts to re-assert their authority.

Despite this Joyce was still employed as an expert to lecture to British colonial administrators on \\"native races\\". Joyce was divorced by his wife, Lilian (born Dayrell) in 1925 and his wife remarried the following year. Joyce's second partner was the travel writer Lilian Elwyn Elliott. Elliott had married before and no evidence has been found of her divorce or a formal marriage ceremony with Joyce.

He served as a junior officer on several smaller craft, including a combat tour during the Russo-Japanese War on the gunboat . After the war, he attended the Naval Staff College where he specialized in naval artillery, graduating with honors from the class of 1909 with the rank of lieutenant commander. After serving as chief gunnery officer on the battleship and cruiser , he was assigned to the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff Office. In 1914, he was sent to Great Britain as a naval attach√© during World War I and was promoted to commander. During the war, he served on and and reported on the Battle of Jutland.

Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies (SIWPS) is a research center that is part of Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs in New York. It was founded in 1951 by President of Columbia Dwight D. Eisenhower as the Institute of War and Peace Studies (IWPS) and was led for its first 25 years by Professor William T. R. Fox. It was given its current name in 2003. By its own description, the institute's researchers analyze \\"the political, military, historical, legal, economic, moral, psychological, and philosophical dimensions of international relations.\\" History President of Columbia Dwight D. Eisenhower had the original idea for the Institute. The impetus for the institute's formation came from President of Columbia Dwight D. Eisenhower. The former general had written to a friend that he found it \\"almost incomprehensible that no American university has undertaken the continuous study of the causes, conduct and consequences of war.\\" Eisenhower at first envisioned an endowed chair, or as he phrased it a \\"Chair for Peace\\", but the idea was then expanded into a full institute. In a March 1950 speech, Eisenhower said the purpose of the institute would be to \\"study war as a tragic social phenomenon ‚Äì its origins, its conduct, its impact and particularly its disastrous consequences upon man's spiritual, intellectual, and material progress.\\" Eisenhower was also instrumental in raising money for the new entity, making use of his fundraising prowess among his network of wealthy friends and acquaintances, in particular Edward J. Bermingham and Clarence Dillon. Eisenhower, who was taken with the idea enough to mention it in a 1950 letter to Winston Churchill, regarded the creation of the institute as his \\"unique contribution\\" to the university during this time as president, and when he stepped down from his position and gave a farewell speech to the university, just days being inaugurated as President of the United States, he listed the institute as one of his projects for which \\"my hopes are especially high\\". The Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies is located on the 13th floor of Columbia's International Affairs Building. The creation of the institute was one of the first that took place in the aftermath of World War II to pursue international security studies, with the others that followed in that decade being the United States Army's research group in the mid-1950s that later became its Strategic Studies Institute, the programs in the 1950s that later became the Mershon Center for International Security Studies at the Ohio State University, the Department of War Studies at King's College London in the 1950s, and the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London in 1958. The initial director of the Institute of War and Peaces Studies was Professor William T. R. Fox. (Eisenhower had originally asked George F. Kennan to take on the job but was rebuffed; Fox, reluctant to take on administrative work, had attempted to refuse too, but Eisenhower had simply said, \\"So glad you will accept the position.\\") Fox said the institute would reject simplistic explanations for the causes of war, and instead endeavor to understand war as \\"a method of protecting the values considered even more precious than the values it places in jeopardy.\\" Early areas of focus for the institute were civil‚Äìmilitary relations and the Cold War and nuclear strategy; these areas, and especially the first, were of particular interest to Fox. The subject areas did broaden over time. The burgeoning field of \\"peace research\\" was not one of them, however, nor was the institute dedicated to pacifism. Under the leadership of Fox, the institute became a viable operation; John A. Krout, dean of the graduate faculty and one of Eisenhower's allies in university administration, said after ten years had gone by that the institute had \\"done a great deal of fine work\\". One emphasis of the institute was in research, and by 1986 nearly 70 books had been published in connection with the institute. The central area of the Institute of War and Peace Studies, here seen in 1985, has featured a historic collection of war-recruitment and propaganda posters as part of its decor. Fox would be director of the institute for 25 years. He was succeeded by Professor Warner R. Schilling, who held the position from 1976 to 1986. Schilling was instrumental in protecting the institute's funding sources and physical space from encroachment by other parts of the university. Professor Howard Wriggins was acting director during 1986‚Äì1987. Professor David A. Baldwin then served as director from 1987 to 1994, followed by Professor Jack Snyder from 1994 to 1997.https://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/educational-magazines/snyder-jack-1951 The next director, who held the position for over two decades, was Professor Richard K. Betts, beginning in 1997. Then in 2020 a new director was named, Professor Keren Yarhi-Milo. She is the first woman to lead the institute. Besides the directors, prominent scholars associated with the institute have included Samuel P. Huntington, Glenn Snyder, Roger Hilsman, Annette Baker Fox, Kenneth Waltz, Robert Jervis, and Stephen Biddle. The institute also helped foster the careers of several members who went on to high positions in government, including Michael Armacost, Joan E. Spero, Lynn E. Davis, and Catherine McArdle Kelleher. In terms of physical location of the institute, it started in brownstones on 117th Street, then during the 1960s moved twice on a temporary basis before settling into the new International Affairs Building on 118th Street in 1970. In 2003, the institute was renamed in honor of Arnold A. Saltzman, an industrialist and diplomat who graduated from Columbia College in 1936. Administratively, the institute remained within the School of International and Public Affairs. Two endowed chairs under the Saltzman name were also added at that time. Saltzman said, \\"No bugles blow for peace ‚Äì and peace is not simply the absence of war. There is no mechanism in our government to wage peace, to look beyond immediate crises and plan for a peaceful future. This Institute can help move us in that direction.\\" Programs The Institute of War and Peaces Studies has never had a teaching program of its own, but rather instruction is carried out through the university's Department of Political Science and the School of International and Public Affairs. The goal has been that members would engage in research, which would inform their teaching in other university departments and schools, and that teaching would likewise benefit the research in return. The institute would become the only non-area-specializing one within the School of International Affairs (later the School of International and Public Affairs). Current programs at the institute include the annual Saltzman Forum, the annual Summer Workshop on the Analysis of Military Operations and Strategy, the International Security Policy Concentration of the School of International and Public Affairs, the Saltzman Working Paper Series, the International Relations Faculty Seminar led by Professor Robert Jervis, the Comparative Defense Studies Program, the Center for International Conflict Resolution, and the Columbia Defense and Security Program.

His surname is probably a variant on Sandbach. Since that family preserved a collection of his papersNow held by Powys County Council Ref M/D/Sand it is likely that he was one of the Sandbachs of Tarporley, Cheshire, later famous as the owners of Hafodunos Hall. Career Little is known of his early career, but he probably arrived in Ireland in 1633 with Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, to whom he seems to have been personally close. He became Recorder of Carrickfergus and then Second Serjeant in 1637. Unusually he was allowed to hold both offices at once, probably because his salary as Serjeant was inadequate.Hart, A.R.

He traveled to Paris, where he studied with Horace Vernet, and in 1859 with the War of Independence renewed, he returned to Italy and worked as correspondent for the journal Illustration of Paris. He assisted the Battalion of Palestro and San Martino; one of his drawings was purchased by Emperor Napoleon III, and presented to King Victor Emanuel II. Among his works is a large canvas depicting La presa di Mola di Gaeta, found at the Officer's Club of the 5th Artillery; Il passaggio del Gorigliano; and a large canvas of Prince Carignano at the batteries of Cappuccini, during the Siege of Gaeta (1860). In 1866 he followed the armies again, and illustrated two events: Prince Umberto at Villafranca amid the quadrato of the 49th infantry and Prince Amedeo wounded at the attack of Cavalchina near Custoza, now found in Palazzo Pitti of Florence. In 1869, he was nominated Vice-Inspector of the Royal Pinacoteca of Turin, and in 1876 Inspector. He painted the portrait of Count Cibrario, who was Grand Master of the Order of Saints Maurizio e Lazzaro, of which Pontremoli was also an officer.

Four of the 115 passengers were killed and another 61 injured; the accident caused $9 million worth of damage. It was the deadliest train accident within New York City since a 1991 subway derailment in Manhattan, and the first accident in Metro-North's history to result in passenger fatalities. The additional $60 million in legal claims paid out have also made it the costliest accident in Metro-North's history. Early investigations found that the train had gone into the curve where it derailed at almost three times the posted speed limit. The engineer, William Rockefeller, later admitted that before reaching the curve he had gone into a \\"daze\\", a sort of highway hypnosis. The leader of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) team investigating said it was likely that the accident would have been prevented had positive train control (PTC) been installed per a prior federal mandate requiring its installation by 2015. Due to a number of other recent accidents involving Metro-North trains and tracks, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) demanded improved safety measures, which Metro- North began implementing within a week of the accident. In late 2014, almost a year after the accident, the NTSB released its final report on the accident. After reiterating its earlier conclusion that PTC would have prevented the accident entirely, it found the most direct cause was Rockefeller's inattention as the train entered the curve. There were other contributing factors. A medical examination following the accident diagnosed sleep apnea, which had hampered his ability to fully adjust his sleep patterns to the morning shift which he had begun working two weeks earlier. The report faulted both Metro-North for not screening its employees in sensitive positions for sleep disorders, and the FRA for not requiring railroads to do such screening. Background The train involved in the accident was the second southbound Hudson Line train of the day, leaving Poughkeepsie, the line's northern terminus, at its scheduled departure time of 5:54 a.m. EST.Metropolitan Transportation Authority, It was powered by a GE P32AC-DM locomotive, capable of running on either diesel fuel or electricity from a third rail. Since Metro-North uses push-pull trains, it was situated at the northern, or rear, end of the train to minimize noise on the underground platforms at Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan, its final destination, where it was scheduled to arrive at 7:43. It carried about 115 passengers. The lead train car involved in the derailment, pictured in 2009 leading a alt=A train headed by a light gray car with a red stripe on the side on a track between two others in a walled area moving from right to left across the image. On its front is the number 6222. Engineer William Rockefeller, a 15-year Metro-North veteran who had started as a clerk in the stationmaster's office at Grand Central and then spent 10 years as an engineer, was operating the train from the cab car, at the front of a consist of seven Bombardier-made Shoreliner passenger coaches, in a mix of Metro-North and Connecticut Department of Transportation livery, two of which were closed off and used only for deadheading by employees. He had recently begun working the morning shift after working afternoons, a change he later told investigators he had made reluctantly,8808 Engineer, 23. requiring that he leave his home in Germantown, approximately north of Poughkeepsie, at 3:30 a.m. for work. To make sure he had adequate rest before his shift, he had gone to bed at 8:30 p.m. the night before following a nine- hour shift the preceding day. He had arrived at work on time after a 43-minute drive, after which he bought a cup of coffee and a hard roll, filled out paperwork and attended a standard safety briefing, followed by tests of the train's safety equipment.8808 Engineer, 5-6 Another veteran employee, Michael Hermann, who in his limited time working with Rockefeller had praised the engineer's \\"very smooth\\" train handling to other Metro-North employees,Conductor, 50. was the conductor; his one assistant leaving Poughkeepsie was Maria Herbert, with whom he regularly worked.Conductor, 39-40. Once underway in predawn darkness that gradually lightened to civil twilight,8808 Engineer, 19 the train proceeded south along the two-track main line, also used by Amtrak for its Empire Service trains. From Poughkeepsie it continued through the mid- and lower Hudson Valley, often right next to the river. Under electromotor diesel power, it made all six of its scheduled stops in the upper, non-electrified portion of the Hudson Line in Dutchess, Putnam and Westchester counties without incident. After Croton-Harmon, the northern end of the line's electrification, where it picked up another assistant conductor, Chris Kelly, it was held up briefly.8808 Engineer, 7 The next stop was Ossining, where it became an express, continuing under diesel power. Between Ossining and the last stop, Tarrytown, just after dawn, Hermann and Herbert swept toward the center of the train, where they met briefly. After Tarrytown, with the train running only a minute behind schedule,8808 Engineer, 34. they began returning to opposite ends of the train, taking seat checks from any passengers who might have boarded there. They were positioning themselves for where Metro-North's rules required them to be, so Herbert could join Rockefeller in the cab and call out signals after the last stop, Harlem‚Äì125th Street. Hermann, in the rear deadhead car with what he estimated to be six other employees, including Kelly, whom he had instructed to do so as the train's light passenger load did not require a third conductor, began doing his paperwork for the trip and preparing for his next. The train continued south over the next on a straight set of four tracks next to the river, all with third rails, past the four stations along the line in the city of Yonkers, a permanent speed restriction of through downtown was augmented by a temporary limit around Ludlow due to construction.8808 Engineer, 8 South of that station the train entered the Bronx. About south of the Riverdale station, Rockefeller should have begun to slow the train down in anticipation of the curve immediately before Spuyten Duyvil station, below the Henry Hudson Bridge where the Harlem River Ship Canal flows into the Hudson across from the northern tip of Manhattan Island. Instead, he later said: It was interrupted when, he felt, \\"something wasn't right with [the train].\\" Linda Smith, of Newburgh, who had boarded the train at Beacon with her sister Donna to see a choral performance at Lincoln Center, recalled that although she, too, was not fully awake, something seemed wrong. \\"It was bumpy and just seemed really at that point I was aware of going very fast.\\" In the cab, Rockefeller initiated an emergency application of the brakes in an attempt to slow the train down, but it was already taking the curve. Accident alt=A map showing the accident site, with the cars depicted as red lines At 7:19 a.m. the train derailed north of the Spuyten Duyvil station, north of Grand Central, just after it had passed the junction with the West Side Line's crossing over the Spuyten Duyvil Bridge, where Amtrak's trains split off to go to Penn Station. In her passenger car, Linda Smith recalled the train turning sideways as the bumps she had felt gave way to bounces and seat cushions flew through the air. \\"It was like a movie going on around me.\\" Debris entered the cars through the broken windows. Joel Zaritsky, a dentist from LaGrangeville headed to a convention, said it was like \\"severe turbulence on an airplane.\\" In the rear deadhead car, Hermann first heard \\"a little bit of like a metallic rattling,\\" which was by itself not an unusual sound, but it just sounded a little bit odd.\\" He recalled to investigators a day later that \\"the next thing I know my car had kicked and I was thrown from the fourth seat or across the coach up to the ceiling ... I dropped down. I went back up again and I slammed into the ceiling and then I slammed down into the floor.\\"Conductor, 9‚Äì11 In the front, Herbert was sitting in the passenger seat behind the cab when \\"I looked up just to do what I was doing and a split second [later] I'm tumbling on the floor ... I think I hit the ceiling several times. I didn't even have time to react or to think what I was doing.\\" When the train came to rest, Hermann, despite a head injury and some bruises, took charge and reported the derailment to the dispatcher. He then worked with Kelly to coordinate the passengers and the emergency responders. In the front Rockefeller, who was mostly uninjured, freed Herbert, who was conscious but had also suffered a head injury, from the seat cushions that had piled up on her. Seeing that Hermann and Kelley had taken charge of the situation, he remained with her until he was taken to a hospital to be examined.8808 Engineer, 10‚Äì11 All seven cars and the locomotive left the tracks. Those in the rear remained next to the tracks; in the front, the cab came to rest just short of the Harlem River. Rockefeller, largely unhurt, got out and began aiding passengers. Trapped under seat cushions, Smith, too, was uninjured but unable to move; her sister was thrown from the train and was one of the four killed in the accident. Linda Smith was one of the 61 injured.  Fatalities  Of the four killed, only one was found inside the train after the derailment; the other three were thrown from the train as it derailed. All had been sitting in the front three cars. Effects Response The New York City Fire Department sent over 125 firefighters to the scene to assist in the rescue. EMS workers were delayed getting to some victims while they waited for the third rails to be de-energized. All service on the Hudson Line was suspended as a consequence of the accident. The nearby West Side Line was reopened to Amtrak trains by 3 p.m. Survivors were taken to a family resource center set up at nearby John F. Kennedy High School; after all passengers were accounted for, it was closed in the afternoon.

A silvery rail car lies along the shore, almost all the way to the water, with its windows either broken out or severely cracked. Behind it is another car, lying almost on its side. For the day of the accident, Metro- North suspended all service on the Hudson Line south of Croton-Harmon. The next day, the first regular business day back from the Thanksgiving holiday, it restored limited service as far south as Yonkers, three stations north of where the derailment occurred, with shuttle buses providing service to the Van Cortlandt Park‚Äî242nd Street subway station, the northern terminus of the 1 train into Manhattan. Shuttle bus service was initiated between the Tarrytown station on the Hudson Line and White Plains on the Harlem Line. Westchester County offered free parking for the duration of the disruption in the lot it operates at the Valhalla station north of White Plains. Metro-North was not the only passenger railroad to experience service disruption. Amtrak, whose Empire Service trains follow the West Side Line tracks from the accident site to Penn Station, suspended all service between New York City and Albany that day, stranding college students and others relying on the train to return to school after the holiday. By the afternoon it had been restored, albeit with delays due to reduced speeds and activity in the accident area. The disruption affected 26,000 people who commute to the city via the Hudson Line. Some commuters temporarily switched to buses, or drove themselves. Across the Hudson, Rockland County offered extra express bus service across the Tappan Zee Bridge to Tarrytown. Drivers noted a slight increase in traffic on the Saw Mill River Parkway as well.alt=A crew of men in orange vests with reflector stripes and neon green hard hats over their clothing laying new railroad ties. Behind them is a large yellow piece of heavy equipment. It is night, and the scene is illuminated by large lights. The derailment caused $9 million in damage. MTA crews worked around the clock to remove the derailed cars and repair damage caused to the tracks when they left them. They spent the day after the crash replacing ballast and laying new concrete ties. By the evening of December 2 all the cars had been righted and restored to the track. They were taken to the Croton-Harmon and Highbridge yards, where the NTSB impounded them for further investigations. Crews siphoned of diesel fuel from the locomotive before removing it, then cleaned spilled fuel from the site with other special equipment. Limited service on one of the three tracks of the Hudson Line through the accident site was restored on Wednesday morning, December 4. Separate trains were combined to make the service possible. Commuters waiting at Poughkeepsie on the first train to run the same route at the same time told a reporter that they were surprised that Metro-North was able to get the line cleared and the trains running again so quickly. Some even expressed sympathy for Rockefeller. While they said they had no fears of the accident recurring, and indeed some said it was safer than driving, one woman was surprised that there had been no fail-safe systems that could have prevented the derailment. \\"I really thought they had that in place. This is the United States.\\" Aftermath The derailment was the first accident involving passenger fatalities in Metro-North's 30-year history, and its first accident in New York involving any fatalities since a 1988 collision in Mount Vernon that killed one crew member. It was the deadliest train accident within New York City since a 1991 subway derailment in Manhattan. Two days later, Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) director Joseph Szabo sent MTA head Thomas Prendergast a letter highly critical of the transit agency. Earlier that year, he observed, there had been a derailment on the New Haven Line serving Connecticut and Westchester County suburbs along Long Island Sound, a CSX freight derailment on the Hudson Line on the very next curve to the south of where the Spuyten Duyvil wreck had occurred, on the other side of the Spuyten Duyvil station, and an accident on the New Haven Line that killed a track worker. These had led to five deaths and 129 injuries. \\"The specific causes of each of these accidents may vary,\\" Szabo wrote, \\"but regardless of the reasons, four serious accidents in less than seven months is simply unacceptable.\\" Szabo asked the MTA for \\"a serious, good faith commitment to the safe operation of the system.\\" He said it needed to tell employees what, specifically, it would do to improve safety. He requested an answer in two days. \\"Immediate corrective action is imperative.\\" Metro-North announced the day afterwards that it would institute a telephone line where employees could confidentially report \\"close calls.\\" Prendergast later replied to Szabo that the railroad had held mandatory safety discussions for 4,000 employees at 20 locations since the accident. The accident spurred further discussion of positive train control (PTC), which might have prevented it. After a 2008 wreck in Los Angeles, the FRA mandated all American railroads implement PTC by 2015. Many resisted, complaining about the cost of the technology. Among those railroads were both MTA commuter railroads, Metro-North and the Long Island Rail Road, which have sought to have that deadline extended until 2018. In the wake of the Spuyten Duyvil derailment, U.S. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, a resident of Cold Spring whose neighbor James Lovell was one of those killed, introduced legislation to make low-interest loans and guarantees available so that commuter railroads like Metro-North could implement PTC. Eventually other congressmembers from the lower Hudson Valley joined as cosponsors. The deadline was later extended to the end of 2020; Bombardier and Siemens, who are installing the technology, believe they will be able to meet it for Metro- North. alt=Four men in reflectorized orange vests and neon green helmets standing next to a set of four railroad tracks installing a signpost next to the track. One is holding a sign with the letters \\"SR\\" in black on yellow. The ground, covered with a thin snow, slopes steeply to the left and an overhead gantry for the catenary is in the background. MTA officials denied that money was the problem, noting that they had budgeted $600 million of the total $900 million estimated cost of PTC installation. Instead they pointed to doubts about the technology's efficacy for large commuter rail networks. On a radio talk show following the crash, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo conceded that PTC is \\"controversial ... [some people say] it's not what it's cracked up to be.\\" The MTA itself said it was \\"untested and unproven for commuter railroads [of our] size and complexity.\\" Several days later The New York Times reported that the train had a device known as an alerter. It sounds an alarm when the train exceeds speed limits for 25 seconds and shuts it down after an additional 15 seconds if no action is taken by the engineer. It might have been able to prevent the accident; however it was in the locomotive, at the rear of the train, not the cab where Rockefeller was located. While Metro- North used it only to prevent collisions, rail safety experts said it could easily be configured to force trains to slow down at curves such as Spuyten Duyvil, since it relied on signals sent through the rails themselves. It was also preferable to the traditional dead man's switch the cab was equipped with, which requires constant action and attention from the engineer. The MTA said it was considering doing so at 30 sites on the Metro-North and LIRR networks. On December 6, the FRA issued an emergency order requiring Metro- North to have two qualified crew members in the cab at any point where the speed limit drops by more than until it installs that technology in cabs and at those sites. The next day Metro-North announced it was upgrading the signals at the Spuyten Duyvil curve and several others in the system; it would also lower the speed limit going into the curve so that it would be a less- than-20-mph drop and thus the extra engineer would not be necessary. U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Charles Schumer of New York called on Metro-North to install cameras to monitor both the track and the engineers. On December 12, the FRA went further. It ordered \\"Operation Deep Dive,\\" a full safety review of Metro-North, in which every aspect of its corporate culture would be evaluated by a panel of rail safety experts. This was the first time the agency had taken this extreme step since 2006, following a series of accidents involving CSX freights. In mid-March 2014, the agency released its report to Congress on the results of Deep Dive. Metro- North, it said, had a \\"deficient safety culture.\\" The FRA identified \\"three overarching safety concerns: * An overemphasis on on-time performance; * An ineffective Safety Department and poor safety culture; and * An ineffective training program.\\" It directed Metro-North to submit a plan for addressing these issues to it within 60 days. It was encouraged by the fact that many of the railroad's employees had cooperated thoroughly with investigators. Investigation NTSB investigators inspect the site of the derailment A team from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was dispatched to the scene of the accident to investigate. It found that the train's brakes had been deployed seconds prior to the crash and that the tracks had no problems. From the train event recorders, the NTSB determined that the train was traveling at ; the speed limit for the section of track involved is . The brakes had indeed been deployed, but had reached their maximum level five seconds after the train entered the curve. After being lifted from where they had come to rest and restored to the track, the cars involved were impounded by the NTSB and taken to Metro-North's yards at Croton-Harmon and Highbridge. Rockefeller surrendered his cell phone and submitted samples for drug and alcohol tests. When it was reported that his attention had lapsed prior to the accident, investigators announced that they would be assembling a timeline of his 72 hours preceding the accident to see whether they could find any explanation. Cause alt=Two railroad tracks curving in opposite directions in a brushy area with water on the right and a high bridge on the left. The track on that side has cement ties and a third rail; the one on the right has wooden ties. It goes to a bridge in the background on that side, behind which is a wooded hill. Early reports suggested that Rockefeller had claimed the brakes failed, although experts pointed out that that was unlikely since the brakes were equipped with a fail safe device that activates them should it detect a pressure drop. The NTSB soon determined that there was no problem with the tracks or the signals. Rockefeller's blood tests came back negative for both alcohol and drugs; his cellphone similarly was out of use at the time of the accident. But, he admitted when investigators were able to interview him, he had drifted into a \\"daze\\" until just before the accident when he tried to stop at the last minute. Two days after the accident, Anthony Bottalico, head of the Association of Commuter Railroad Employees (ACRE), the Metro-North union, said that engineer William Rockefeller had \\"nodded off\\" before the accident. He likened it to white-line fever experienced by truckers. Rockefeller had recently started working the early shift instead of in the afternoons; however on the day of the accident he had apparently had adequate sleep and arrived at work on time from his home in Germantown, where he was seen to be alert and vivacious. Rockefeller's attorney confirmed the remarks. Shortly after Bottalico's comments, the NTSB barred ACRE from further participation in the investigation for disclosing too much information. A day later Rockefeller was suspended without pay. In early April, federal investigators revealed that after the accident, Rockefeller had been diagnosed with severe obstructive sleep apnea, a complication of his obesity, which may have contributed to his loss of attention. His blood had also been found to have a small amount of chlorpheniramine, an anti-histamine commonly found in over-the-counter cold medications. Possible sedative effects require that those medications be contraindicated for use while driving or operating heavy machinery and include a warning to that effect on their packaging. While Rockefeller had initially denied taking any such medications to investigators, his lawyer said that would not justify a criminal charge, a step the district attorney's office said it was still considering at that point. NTSB Board Member Earl Weener briefs the press on the derailment The NTSB's final report, issued almost 11 months after the accident, reiterated many of its earlier conclusions that positive train control would have prevented the accident by automatically applying the brakes in the curve, and that Rockefeller's sleep disorder was the likely reason for his loss of attention. It went on to fault Metro-North for not routinely screening for sleep disorders employees in positions defined by federal regulations as safety-sensitive, and the FRA for not requiring railroads to do so. Lastly, it said that the failure of the glazings, or the windows on the cars, contributed to the loss of life and severity of injury. Legal actions =Civil= Within a week of the accident, attorneys for several passengers had filed notices of claims, the first step toward filing a lawsuit, against Metro-North. Lawyers for a police officer riding the train to work said his injuries could prevent him from returning to duty and demanded $10 million. In 2018 he settled for $450,000; his attorney said he had also been suffering post-traumatic stress disorder from the accident. Denise Williams, a dentist headed to a convention in the city who required back surgery for a fractured spine after she was trapped under a heavy passenger car for several hours, also gave notice through her attorney, who questioned among other things why the railroad had not replaced hundred-year-old track near the derailment site. Lawyers said it might be difficult for them to recover those amounts from Metro-North and the MTA if the cause of the accident turned out to be Rockefeller's lapse at the controls, since there would be far less liability on their part. New York law further limits potential damages in cases like these. Victims' lawyers said their goal was not so much the money but making sure the railroad installed PTC. In early April, after the release of the FRA report, Eddie Russel, a New Windsor man who had been on the train, filed suit. He named the MTA, Metro- North, the city and Rockefeller as defendants, seeking $10 million in punitive damages. \\"One has to question whether the culture at Metro-North which led to the deaths of four people, should be investigated for criminal actions,\\" said Russell's lawyer, who also faulted the MTA for not setting up a claims process in the wake of the accident, forcing those seeking compensation to litigate at increased costs both to themselves and the agencies. In 2018 it was reported that Metro-North had paid out $60 million in claims related to the accident, making it the costliest in the railroad's history. Since that amount exceeded the limit per accident in the MTA's liability insurance, AIG was contracted to cover its future legal costs, as not all the claims and litigation have been resolved yet. Rockefeller lawsuit After Metro-North had initially denied Rockefeller a disability pension based on the PTSD he suffered from the accident, he appealed, and in late 2016, Metro North announced that he would receive $3,200 a month. \\"The Pension Disability Medical Review Board reviewed the appeal and determined that Mr. Rockefeller is disabled from performing his function as an engineer and he is eligible now to receive his pension,\\" the MTA said. Rockefeller's lawyer declined to comment on the pension award but said the lawsuit would continue. At the same time he received the pension, Rockefeller sued the MTA for $10 million in federal court, alleging the railroad had failed to install a system to alert engineers when the speed limit is exceeded. He argued that after another engineer had been suspended for two weeks in 2005 after speeding through the same curve in a manner that knocked passengers' belongings off the overheard luggage rack, the railroad had to know the curve was dangerous; one of its engineers suggested installing the automatic braking. Metro-North's executives declined, the engineer had said, fearing it would add almost a minute to travel time. Executives also believed it was better to rely at least in part on the engineer remaining alert, citing a 2009 accident on the Washington Metro that was attributed to putting too much trust in technology found to be dysfunctional at the time. The MTA countersued Rockefeller for the same amount, citing the cost of the damage resulting from the accident. In April 2019 the judge hearing the case dismissed the MTA's motion for summary judgement, ruling that Rockefeller had presented enough evidence that a juror could reasonably conclude his former employer was at fault. The railroad had in response introduced evidence from the train's event recorder that suggested Rockefeller had been driving the train erratically earlier on that run, at one point slowing to less than on a section where the speed limit was around , and had told Herbert when the train left Poughkeepsie that \\"it's your job to keep me awake\\", an account Herbert had denied when prosecutors from the Bronx D.A.'s office asked her about it during their investigation. Four months later, Rockefeller withdrew the suit. =Criminal investigation= The office of Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson reviewed the evidence gathered to see whether criminal charges, which could be as serious as negligent homicide, were warranted against Rockefeller. While criminal charges have been filed against the operators of vehicles in other recent deadly transportation accidents in and around New York City, and convictions have often resulted, defense lawyers said in this case it would be difficult to find a credible offense, since Rockefeller was exhibiting no clear sign of negligence such as alcoholism or cell phone use, and operating a vehicle while drowsy is not necessarily a crime. In 2012, prosecutors argued that Ophadell Williams, the driver of a bus on which 15 passengers died on their way to a casino in Connecticut, had knowingly endangered lives by repeatedly driving without adequate sleep. A jury acquitted him of all charges except operating a vehicle without a license. In May 2015, almost a year and a half after the accident, the Bronx D.A.'s office announced it would not be filing charges. \\"There was no criminality in the act, therefore no criminal charges,\\" said a spokeswoman for Johnson, adding that he had made that decision several months beforehand. Rockefeller's lawyer, Jeffrey Chartier, said that since his client hadn't known of his medical condition, he could not be considered to be negligent. It was \\"the only logical conclusion\\", similar to what the NTSB had already found. Chartier said Rockefeller was still suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of the accident. Linda Smith, whose sister Donna died in the accident, accepted Johnson's decision, saying it spared her the stress of having to relive the accident at trial, stress a similar recent Amtrak accident was causing her at the time. She felt it was punishment enough for Rockefeller to have to live with his role in the accident. \\"In a way, he's in jail forever, because he's got to live with this.\\" See also * List of American railroad accidents * List of rail accidents (2010‚Äìpresent) Similar accidents * 2015 Philadelphia train derailment, later accident involving an Amtrak Northeast Regional train that sped in a 50 mph curve more than twice that speed limit * 2016 Hoboken train crash, later accident involving New York City-area commuter rail where engineer was diagnosed with sleep apnea, possibly explaining why he lost awareness going into a station * 2017 Washington train derailment, also involving a train that went into a 30 mph curve at more than twice that limit * Bourne End rail crash, similar accident in Britain where a sleep-challenged engineer may have momentarily lost attention and taken the train into a curve too fast * Grantham rail crash, another British accident with a similar momentary lapse of the engineer's attention suggested as an explanation for why he disregarded signals and derailed the train by taking it into a misaligned switch * Redondo Junction train wreck, worst rail accident in Los Angeles history, where engineer who claimed to have \\"blacked out\\" before going into a curve too fast * Newton, Massachusetts, train collision, in 2008, where the engineer's sleep apnea was also blamed posthumously for her inattention at a crucial moment * O'Hare station train crash in 2014; may also have been caused by an overworked, sleep-deprived train operator *2016 Croydon tram derailment a similar accident caused by a driver undergoing microsleep while in command of a tram.

The NDF enjoyed various successes throughout the war, although it was weakened by the peace treaty between North and South Yemen following the 1979 border war. There were several attempts at ceasefires between the government and the NDF. Kuwait managed to facilitate the signing of a ceasefire between the government and the NDF on 26 November 1981, although hostilities re-erupted in December 1981. Later, the Palestinian Liberation Organization was able to mediate a ceasefire agreement on 3 April 1982, however hostilities began again later the same April, with the NDF capturing Juban. Government forces in turn attacked NDF positions in Juban in May 1982. May 1982 PDRY support for the NDF diminished under the Presidency of the less overtly militant Ali Nasir Muhammad, and PDRY support for the NDF finally ended in May 1982. Dhamar, a major NDF stronghold, sustained major damage during the 1982 North Yemen earthquake. The NDF was eventually defeated by a rejuvenated YAR Army in conjunction with the pro-government Islamic Front, allowing the YAR government to finally establish control over the North-South border region.

He became prior of Cividale, then archdeacon of Aquileia. Pellegrino succeeded Godfrey of Hohenstaufen as Patriarch of Aquileia in 1195. Patriarch During Pellegrino's patriarchy there were constant wars against Gorizia, Treviso and Ezzelino II da Romano. Pellegrino remained neutral when war broke out in 1198 between the Ghibelline Philip of Swabia, King of Germany and son of Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor, and the Guelph rebel Otto, Duke of Brunswick. He continued his war against Treviso, laying siege to Pordenone, but was defeated in 1201 by the League at Tagliamento. Pellegrino was forced to seek an alliance with Venice. As part of the price, at a conference in San Quirino at Cormons in 1202 the counts of Gorizia were given full independence of Aquileia.

It is an archaeological site which was inhabited since the Middle Bronze Age. In the Iron Age the hill was the site of an Oenotrian settlement. Over time the settlement was transformed into an important sanctuary, which was notable as the site of the first known ancient Greek temples on the Italian Peninsula. The Oenotrians were influenced by the culture of the Greek colonists from nearby Sybaris, who eventually took over the site in the second half of the seventh century. The hill was abandoned when the Bruttians conquered the region in the fourth century BC.  Geography  The hill has an elevation of 280 meters above sea level and overlooks the coastal plain of Sibari and the Gulf of Taranto. It is on the northern bank of the seasonal Raganello river. Close to the hilltop is the acropolis, which was the location of a sanctuary with three temples. The acropolis was surrounded by a defensive wall. Several terraces with evidence of settlement are located further downhill and the Macchiabate necropolis lies at the foot of the hill. The ancient Greek city of Sybaris was located at a distance of 15 kilometers to the southeast.  History  The remains of Temple III on the acropolis The remains of Temple V and the later Byzantine chapel on the acropolis The Macchiabate necropolis at the foot of the Timpone della Motta  Oenotrian period  The oldest remains belong to a Middle Bronze Age dwelling which stood on the later site of Temple V on the acropolis. During the Iron Age in the ninth and eight centuries BC the hill was the site of a large Oenotrian settlement. Archaeological evidence indicates that a weaving house stood at the site of the Bronze Age dwelling in this period. This building was three times the size of a contemporary native hut discovered on Plateau I and might have had a religious function as well. In the last quarter of the eight century BC this house and the other Oenotrian apsidal wooden dwellings on the acropolis were replaced by long rectangular wooden temples dedicated to Athena. The temples followed a Greek design but were constructed with native techniques. They were built around a plaza in the center, with Temple I to the northeast of the plaza, Temple V (built on the location of the weaving house) to the southwest and Temple III to the northwest. Temples I and V were built parallel to the length of the plaza, but Temple III had an entrance which faced the plaza. These temples were the first known ancient Greek temples on the Italian Peninsula. The Greek colony Sybaris was founded around the same time, in 720 BC. There is no evidence to suggest that the site suffered a violent takeover by the Greek colonists, so it is more likely that the Oenotrians and the Greeks co-operated in the construction of the temples at a time when Greek religion was transmitted to the Oenotrian culture.  Greek takeover  During the seventh century BC the settlement was reduced and habitation did not occur on the lower plateaus anymore, but elsewhere in the vicinity. In the second half of the seventh century BC the sanctuary was apparently taken over by the Sybarites, who celebrated large festivals there regularly. At this time a new generation of mudbrick temples was erected on top of the old wooden temples, which were demolished. In the sixth century BC an intensive building program was started at the site leading to the construction of large colonial houses on all the plateaus and the rearrangement of the sanctuary. The mudbrick Temple V was demolished and a gravel foundation was used to eliminate the height difference of the site of Temple V with the rest of the acropolis. A new Temple V made of stone replaced the older temple. New stone temples also replaced Temple III and I, which were built on a stone foundation of riverbed cobbles. The site must have been abandoned when the Bruttians conquered the region at some time in the fourth century BC. Centuries later a Byzantine chapel was constructed on top of the foundations of Temple V, but there is no evidence of a settlement existing in this period.  Identification as Lagaria  Thousands of hydriskai were found on the acropolis. Because there is no natural source of water on the Timpone della Motta, these hydriskai must have been used to carry water up the hill. The images of processions seen on the pottery found at the site show women carrying water and Athena is associated with Epeius in mythology. Combined with ancient literary evidence this had led to the proposal that the Timpone della Motta was the site of Lagaria. An older source places Lagaria much further north however, near Valsinni.  Excavation  The first excavation of the Macchiabate necropolis was started in 1963 by Paola Zancani Montuoro. She delegated the excavation of the acropolis to Maria W. Stoop and the investigation of the lower terraces to Marianne Kleibrink from 1965 onwards. The excavations were stopped in 1969 because Montuoro participated in the excavations of Sybaris. In the 1970s illegal excavations took place on large scale on the southern slope of the Timpone della Motta. Many stolen artefacts were sold on the antiquities market to private collectors and museums. Eventually these were identified and most of them were returned to the Museo Nazionale Archeologico della Sibaritide, where the finds from Timpone della Motta are exhibited.

Originally occupied by Native Americans, the eventual settlement became a thriving agricultural-based town post Civil War, through first half of the twentieth century. The decline of the railroads, the impoundment of the Pearl River, and the general migration of settlers toward nearby cities led to Fannin's eventual dis-incorporation and transition into a mostly rural residential community (though a few small businesses remain).History of Fannin, Rankin County Historical Society, History of Fannin Early history and settlement The area comprising eventual Fannin was originally inhabited by Choctaw and Chickasaw tribes. Following Mississippi being granted statehood in 1817- as well as the expulsion of local Indian tribes to Oklahoma- early settlers from the Carolinas claimed available land grants in the 1830s. The first settlers of Fannin were drawn to the area largely due to the abundance of grazing land, timber resources, and natural springs. These handful of early settler further sub-divided their land holdings to other settlers over a roughly 60 year period, resulting in moderate population growth, and the establishment of thriving timber and agricultural industries by 1900. The town of Fannin By approximately 1840, inhabitants of the area were starting to identify as a town proper, referred to then as the \\"little city\\" of Fannin. Local lore suggests the town took the name \\"Fannin\\" after a soldier of the same name died in a house fire. A small city section of schools, churches, stores, and other small businesses developed, centralized among the estates of land owners and slave holders. Still largely agriculturally based, the years approaching the turn of the century saw the growth of saw and timber mills, cotton gins, and livestock-based industries. Educational institution sprouted up, attended by children of wealthy land owners. Schoolhouses were maintained for the children of slaves and black free-men. A community college was established by a local chapter of Masons, which housed in its tower a silver bell, cast from metal of 200 silver-dollars donated by wealthy residents. The sound of the bell ringing became a staple of the Fannin community, but was lost, or perhaps stolen, when the college transitioned to a new location in the early 20th century. New Fannin and decline The 1920s was a period of transition for the town of Fannin. Railroad lines were established just west of the town proper, where a terminal was built to service the towns of Jackson and Union. Many industries and businesses, most notably the Masonic college, were relocated three miles to the west of the original city center in order to be better served by the train line. This area became known as \\"New Fannin,\\" and though the rail line opened up the community to more convenient access to nearby cities, it also marked the slow decline of the town's population, as industry and business migrated from the city center, and school children began being served by schools outside of the town proper. Slowly, the town of Fannin dissipated, and New Fannin never developed into the thriving city center that \\"old\\" Fannin had once been. Modern day Fannin community From roughly 1930‚Äìpresent day, Fannin slowly devolved from an established town, into a rural farm community, and finally into little more than a geographic point of reference and curiosity known by local residents. A small grouping of churches and businesses remain at the intersection of present-day Fannin Landing Circle and Highway 471, marking the remains of the once thriving city center. The turning point of Fannin's decline can be traced, largely, back to the mid-1950s, following the dismantlement of the rail-line, when the Pearl River was impounded to create the Ross Barnett Reservoir in an effort to provide a drinking water resource for the nearby city of Jackson. At that time, a State agency- the Pearl River Valley Water Supply District (PRVWSD)- was created to manage the newly created watershed land. Land for residential development became much more valuable than for agricultural and industrial use, and, as a result, land sales focused more on the building of new homes in the rural setting, rather than large expanses of farm or timber land. Nearby cities of Brandon, Ridgeland and Jackson served as city center for Fannin resident's commercial needs; school children attended Rankin County Schools based near Brandon; and, ultimately, following improvements in roads and transportation methods, the infrastructure of a town proper in the Fannin community became unnecessary. Today, Fannin is little more than an intersection of two rural roads, surrounded by a few old farm-homes, and mostly modern residential developments and subdivisions.

Classified as a major class port, it is the largest harbour in the country. Historical overview Since the Roman empire, a commercial port called Sarapion existed in what is now modern Mogadishu. However, during the Middle Ages the port of Mogasdishu was very small and only with the arrival of the Italians in 1890 were the first improvements made in order to create a modern port. The port has since increased in capacity to become most important port of Somalia and one of the biggest in eastern Africa. Porto di Mogadiscio The Port of Mogadishu was created as a modern port (called in Italian Porto di Mogadiscio) with magazines and docks in the late 1920s by the Italian government of Italian Somalia. In 1930 a protective dike with breakwaters was made in front of the enlarged port,Map of the Mogadiscio port which was connected to the Somalia interior by a railway and even by a new \\"imperial road\\" (from Mogasdishu to Addis Abeba).Alberto Arecchi: Mogadiscio ed urbanesimo (in Italian) In 1934, the port of Italian Mogadiscio had exports of 43.467 tons of agricultural products (mainly bananas) to Italy and Europe. For this commercial transport were used the service of special container-ships called \\"RAMB\\" (that were built with the possibility to be converted to be an auxiliary cruiser). The Ramb II was a banana boat based in Mogadishu. This was the second of four sister ships all built to the same design: the other ships were the Ramb I, the Ramb III, and the Ramb IV. The four ships were built for the Royal Banana Monopoly Business (\\"Regia Azienda Monopolio Banane\\") to transport refrigerated bananas from Italian Somalia to Italy. In 1936 the port started to have a weekly international ship line for passengers, connecting Mogadishu with Massaua in Eritrea and Genova in Italy with the Italian Lloyd Triestino and Italian Line.Ship lines of Mogadishu port (in Italian) The MS Vulcania was a transatlantic ship that served the port of Mogadiscio. Later, in 1941 the port was damaged by British bombings during World War II. During the 1960s the port was improved, thanks to studies done by the US Army Corps of Engineers.Bibliographia Aethiopica; p.259 Mogadishu Port Rehabilitation Project A man controls cargo handling equipment as they offload. After it incurred some damage during the civil war, the Federal Government of Somalia launched the Mogadishu Port Rehabilitation Project, an initiative to rebuild, develop and modernize the port. The renovations include the installation of Alpha Logistics technology. A joint international delegation consisting of the Director of the Port of Djibouti and Chinese officials specializing in infrastructure reconstruction concurrently visited the facility in June 2013. According to Mogadishu Port manager Abdullahi Ali Nur, the delegates along with local Somali officials received reports on the port's functions as part of the rebuilding project's planning stages. In November 2014, Minister of Transportation Said Jama Mohamed launched a new transportation reform initiative at the Port of Mogadishu. The minister met with local transportation union officials to discuss how to optimize the new system's implementation, ensure its transparency and accountability, and gauge their requirements and those of the owners of transported goods that they represent. According to Mohamed, the project's ultimate goal is to establish a fair transportation system. He also stressed that transport owners should make sure that their vehicles are in good condition and attain the standards of goods owners. Simatech Shipping In 2013, the Port of Mogadishu's management reportedly reached an agreement with representatives of the Dubai-based company Simatech Shipping LLC to handle vital operations at the seaport. Under the name Mogadishu Port Container Terminal, the firm is slated to handle all of the port's technical and operational functions. Al-Bayrak In October 2013, the federal Cabinet endorsed an agreement with the Turkish firm Al- Bayrak to manage the Port of Mogadishu for a 20-year period. According to the Prime Minister's Office, the deal was secured by the Ministry of Ports and Public Works, and also assigns Al-Bayrak responsibility for rebuilding and modernizing the port. Al-Bayrak had previously overseen construction of the Istanbul Metro in Istanbul. In April 2014, the Federal Parliament postponed finalization of the Seaport Management Deal pending the approval of a new foreign investment bill. The MPs also requested that the agreement be submitted to the legislature for deliberation and to ensure that the interests of the port's manual labourers are taken into account. In September 2014, the federal government officially delegated management of the Mogadishu Port to Al-Bayrak. The Turkish company's head Ahmed Salim indicated that under the terms of the agreement, 55% of revenue generated at the seaport will go to the government and the remaining 45% is earmarked for the firm. According to Minister for Transports and Seaport Yussuf Maolim Amin, the management transfer is expected to double the federal authorities' income from the Port. Al-Bayrak's modernization project will cost $80 million. According to Al- Bayrak, the majority of its revenue share will be re-invested in the seaport through additional port-based trade and new docks, construction materials and machinery. The company also plans to install an environment wall and a closed circuit camera system in accordance with international security protocols, erect a modern port administration building, and clean the ship entrance channels via underwater surveillance. As of September 2014, the first phase of the renovations were reportedly complete, with the second phase underway. During its first month of operation under Al-Bayrak, the port generated $2.7 million in service revenue. African Shipping Line‚ÄìMogadishu Towards 2014, a Dubai-registered shipping line company advanced its expansion to Mogadishu Port.

Following a 1972 agreement between the Siad Barre administration and the USSR, the port's facilities were patronized by the Soviets. It was later expanded for US military use, after the Somali authorities strengthened ties with the American government. As of 2013, the Port of Berbera has a 650-metre berth and a depth of 11.5‚Äì12 metres. It is strategically located along the oil route. In July 2013, the Raysut Cement of Oman announced that it is scheduled to build a new state-of-the-art cement terminal at the Port of Berbera. The construction project is part of a joint venture with Somali business partners. It will comprise three silos with a 4000 t capacity each, which will be earmarked for storage, packing and distribution of cement. DP World Berbera Container Terminal Port. In May 2016, DP World signed a US$442 million agreement with the government of Somaliland, a self declared but unrecognised de facto sovereign state to operate a regional trade and logistics hub at the Port of Berbera. The project, which will be phased in, will also involve the setting up of a free zone. On 1 March 2018, Ethiopia became a major shareholder following an agreement with DP World and the Somaliland Port Authority. DP World holds a 51% stake in the project, Somaliland 30% and Ethiopia the remaining 19%. As part of the agreement, the government of Ethiopia will invest in infrastructure to develop the Berbera Corridor as a trade gateway for the inland country, which is one of the fastest growing countries in the world. There are also plans to construct an additional berth at the Port of Berbera, in line with the Berbera master plan, which DP World has started implementing, while adding new equipment to further improve efficiencies and productivity of the port. The agreement comes as part of a larger government-to-government Memorandum of understanding between Government of the United Arab Emirates and the Administration of Somaliland to further strengthen their strategic ties. However, the agreement has stirred up debate with the main Somaliland opposition party, Waddani party arguing the agreement was between Somalia and the UAE, this claim was denied by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Somalia stating that no evidence was produced indicating the Berbera port deal was signed with previous governments of Somalia.

It is classified as a major class port. The port is operated by P&O; Ports since 2017. History The modern Port of Bosaso was constructed during the mid-1980s by the Siad Barre administration for annual livestock shipments to the Middle East. In January 2012, a renovation project was launched at the Bosaso Port, with KMC contracted to upgrade the harbor. The initiative's first phase saw the clean-up of unwanted materials from the dockyard and was completed within the month. The second phase involves the reconstruction of the port's adjoining seabed, with the objective of accommodating larger ships. On 6 April 2017, Dubai-based P&O; Ports won a 30-year concession for Port for the management and development of a multi- purpose port project. The approximate investment for the modern multi-purpose facility was USD $336 million. President of Puntland, Abdiweli Mohamed Ali signed the agreement in Dubai on 6 April 2017. The Work on the project will involve building a 450m quay and a 5 hectare back up area, dredging to a depth of 12m with reclamation work using dredge spoil. There will also be major investment in an IT and Terminal Operating System (TOS), mobile harbor cranes and container handling equipment. On 4 February 2019, the manager of the port was shot and killed by two Al Shabab militants disguised as fishermen. The manager was on his way to work when he was shot and killed in a fish market. Two guards at the port were also injured in the attack. Dubai based P&O; ports confirmed the death of the manager as well as the injury of three others. The Shabab militant group claimed responsibility and said they had attacked P&O; Ports because it ‚Äúoccupies‚Äù the Bosaso port. They said that the manager, a Maltese citizen, was \\"illegally in Somalia\\". Transportation The Garowe‚ÄìBosaso Highway is a major thoroughfare in the autonomous Puntland region in northeastern Somalia . It connects the administrative capital of Garowe with the commercial hub of Bosaso , a distance of around 450 km (279.1 mi). The Garowe‚ÄìBosaso Highway was constructed in 1988, after an Italian firm Merzario had been contracted to build the main trunk road, including its culverts and bridges. Its tarmac was later completed in 1990. Abdirizak Jurile was responsible administratively and operationally to build The Garowe‚ÄìBosaso Highway and the Port of Bosaso in the Bari province. The highway starts from the Port of Bosaso and continues south as a single carriageway up over the Al- Miskat hills and downwards toward Qardho.

Due to the simplicity of the regular Morse potential (it only has three adjustable parameters), it is not used in modern spectroscopy. The MLR potential is a modern version of the Morse potential which has the correct theoretical long-range form of the potential naturally built into it. It was first introduced by professor Robert J. Le Roy of University of Waterloo, professor Nike Dattani of Oxford University and professor John A. Coxon of Dalhousie University in 2009 Since then it has been an important tool for spectroscopists to represent experimental data, verify measurements, and make predictions. It is particularly renowned for its extrapolation capability when data for certain regions of the potential are missing, its ability to predict energies with accuracy often better than the most sophisticated ab initio techniques, and its ability to determine precise empirical values for physical parameters such as the dissociation energy, equilibrium bond length, and long-range constants. Cases of particular note include: # the c-state of Li2: where the MLR potential was successfully able to bridge a gap of more than 5000 cm‚àí1 in experimental data. Two years later it was found that Dattani's MLR potential was able to successfully predict the energies in the middle of this gap, correctly within about 1 cm‚àí1. The accuracy of these predictions was much better than the most sophisticated ab initio techniques at the time. # the A-state of Li2: where Le Roy et al. constructed an MLR potential which determined the C3 value for atomic lithium to a higher-precision than any previously measured atomic oscillator strength, by an order of magnitude. This lithium oscillator strength is related to the radiative lifetime of atomic lithium and is used as a benchmark for atomic clocks and measurements of fundamental constants. It has been said that this work by Le Roy et al. was a \\"landmark in diatomic spectral analysis\\". # the a-state of KLi: where an analytic global (MLR) potential was successfully built despite there only being a small amount of data near the top of the potential.  Historical origins  The MLR potential is based on the classic Morse potential which was first introduced in 1929 by Philip M. Morse. A primitive version of the MLR potential was first introduced in 2006 by professor Robert J. Le Roy and colleagues for a study on N2. This primitive form was used on Ca2, KLi and MgH, before the more modern version was introduced in 2009 by Le Roy, Dattani, and Coxon. A further extension of the MLR potential referred to as the MLR3 potential was introduced in a 2010 study of Cs2, and this potential has since been used on HF, HCl, HBr and HI.  Function  The Morse/Long-range potential energy function is of the form :V(r) = \\\\mathfrak{D}_e \\\\left( 1- \\\\frac{u(r)}{u(r_e)} e^{-\\\\beta(r)y_p^{r_{\\\\rm{eq}}}(r)} \\\\right)^2 where for large r, :V(r) \\\\simeq \\\\mathfrak{D}_e - u(r) + \\\\frac{u(r)^2}{4\\\\mathfrak{D}_e}, so u(r) is defined according to the theoretically correct long-range behavior expected for the interatomic interaction. This long-range form of the MLR model is guaranteed because the argument of the exponent is defined to have long-range behavior: :\\\\beta(r)y_p^{r_{\\\\rm{ref}}}(r) \\\\simeq \\\\beta_\\\\infty = \\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{2\\\\mathfrak{D}_e}{u(r_e)}\\\\right), where r_e is the equilibrium bond length. There are a few ways in which this long-range behavior can be achieved, the most common is to make \\\\beta(r) a polynomial that is constrained to become \\\\beta_\\\\infty at long-range: :\\\\beta(r) = \\\\left(1-y_p^{r_{\\\\rm{ref}}}(r)\\\\right)\\\\sum_{i=0}^{N_{\\\\beta}}\\\\beta_i y_q^{r_{\\\\rm{ref}}}(r)^i+y_p^{r_{\\\\rm{ref}}}(r)\\\\beta_\\\\infty, :y_n^{r_x}(r) = \\\\frac{r^n-r_x^n}{r^n+r_x^n}, where n is an integer greater than 1, which value is defined by the model chosen for the long-range potential u_\\\\text{LR}(r). It is clear to see that: :\\\\lim_{r\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty}\\\\beta(r) = \\\\beta_\\\\infty. Applications The MLR potential has successfully summarized all experimental spectroscopic data (and/or virial data) for a number of diatomic molecules, including: N2, Ca2, KLi, MgH, several electronic states of Li2, Cs2, Sr2, ArXe, LiCa, LiNa, Br2, Mg2, HF, HCl, HBr, HI, MgD, Be2, BeH, and NaH. More sophisticated versions are used for polyatomic molecules. It has also become customary to fit ab initio points to the MLR potential, to achieve a fully analytic ab initio potential and to take advantage of the MLR's ability to incorporate the correct theoretically known short- and long-range behavior into the potential (the latter usually being of higher accuracy than the molecular ab initio points themselves because it is based on atomic ab initio calculations rather than molecular ones, and because features like spin-orbit coupling which are difficult to incorporate into molecular ab inito calculations can more easily be treated described in the long-range). Examples of molecules for which the MLR has been used to represent ab initio points are KLi, KBe.

Lake Karachay, located in the southern Ural Mountains in eastern Russia, was a dumping ground for the Soviet Union's nuclear weapon facilities. It was also affected by a string of accidents and disasters causing the surrounding areas to be highly contaminated with radioactive waste. Although the lake has an area much smaller than that of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, and albeit the fact that three settlements, Ozyorsk, and some 7 kilometers away are inhabited and that the lake is surrounded by Mayak, the lake is still technically a natural area and thus has been described as the \\"most polluted spot on Earth\\" by Washington, D.C.-based Worldwatch Institute.Lenssen, \\"Nuclear Waste: The Problem that Won't Go Away\\", Worldwatch Institute, Washington, D.C., 1991: 15.  History  Built in the late 1940s Mayak was one of Russia's most prominent nuclear weapons factories. Mayak was kept secret by the government until 1990. When Russian president Boris Yeltsin signed a 1992 decree opening the area, Western scientists were able to gain access. The sediment of the lake bed is estimated to be composed almost entirely of high level radioactive waste deposits to a depth of roughly 11 feet (3.4 m). In 1994, a report revealed that 5 million cubic meters of polluted water had migrated from Lake Karachay, and was spreading to the south and north at 80 meters per year, \\"threatening to enter water intakes and rivers\\".Lavernov, N. P., B. I. Omelianeako, and V. I. Velichkin. 1994. Geological aspects of the nuclear waste disposal problem. Berkeley: Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. Page 3. The authors acknowledged that \\"theoretical hazards developed into actual events\\". In November 1994, officials from the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy stated that Soviet officials initiated a process following the 1957 Kyshtym disaster resulting in the transfer of 3 billion curies of high level nuclear waste into deep wells at three other sites.\\"Critical Masses: Citizens, Nuclear Weapons Production, and Environmental Destruction in the United States and Russia\\", by Russell J. Dalton, 1999, p.79 After a drought caused water levels to drop, revealing contaminated silt, which was then wind blown, further polluting surrounding areas, it was decided to completely fill in the lake. The Techa River, which provides water to nearby areas, was contaminated, and about 65% of local residents fell ill with radiation sickness. Doctors called it the \\"special disease\\" because they were not allowed to note radiation in their diagnoses as long as the facility was secret. In the village of , it was found that 65% of residents were suffering from chronic radiation sickness. Workers at the plutonium plant were also affected.  Causes  The pollution of Lake Karachay is connected to the disposal of nuclear materials from Mayak. Among workers, cancer mortality remains an issue. By one estimate, the river contains 120 million curies of radioactive waste.\\"Russia\\", p. 121, publisher = Lonely Planet  Prevalence of pollution  Nuclear waste, either from civilian or military nuclear projects, remains a serious threat to the environment of Russia.\\"The Politics of Environmental Policy in Russia\\", p. 34, by David Lewis Feldman, Ivan Blokov Reports suggest that there are few or no road signs warning about the polluted areas surrounding Lake Karachay.\\"The Burning Lake: A Volk Thriller\\", by Brent Ghelfi, p. 101 Some parts of the lake are extremely radioactive (600 r√∂ntgens/hour) and one could receive a lethal dose of radiation in 30 minutes (300 r√∂ntgens).

She is the niece of Berthe Morisot and Eug√®ne Manet, the brother of √âdouard Manet, who taught her lessons in painting as part of her education upon being orphaned at an early age. She was unknown in the art scene compared to her relatives. She exhibited with the Soci√©t√© des Ind√©pendants in 1904 and in 1926.  Life and works  The few details on Gobillard's personal life that are extant are largely based on the memoirs of her cousin Julie Manet. She was born in the town of Quimperl√©, on the southern coast of Brittany. She was the eldest daughter of Th√©odore Gobillard (1833‚Äì1879) and Yves Morisot (1838‚Äì1893), who was the sister of Berthe Morisot, noted female Impressionist painter, and a direct descendant of Jean-Honor√© Fragonard, a Rococo painter of the Ancien R√©gime. She had two siblings, Marcel and Jeanne. Throughout her childhood, Gobillard was the student and frequent model of her aunt and she is featured in at least ten of Morisot's paintings, including Paule Gobillard En Robe De Bal. At the age of 26, Gobillard stood orphaned along with her siblings as their mother died in 1893 and resided with her aunt, Berthe in Paris. During their stay with her aunt, she and her sister Jeanne stood initially as models for her paintings. Favored by her aunt as a model in her works, Berthe taught her painting. Impressed by her Impressionistic tutelage, she painted the everyday life of children, women and the outdoors with the tenderness of light pastels notably in the depiction in her still-lifes of flowers in their vases. Gobillard oil on canvas, 24 x 15 inches; Findlay Galleries She also drew upon the color hues from her other mentor, Pierre- Auguste Renoir who brought sensuality to the style of Impressionism. Renoir would often implore the Gobillard sisters to pose for him as models and teach them on the side, painting during his encounters in the southern coast of France, notably in Brittany. During this period, she also served as a model in several of close friend Edgar Degas' photographs.Degas, Edgar. Paule Gobillard, Jeannie Gobillard, Julie Manet, and Genevi√®ve Mallarm√©. Gelatin Silver Print. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, NY, NY. In 1894, she held her first exhibition of her works and was subsequently exhibited with other prominent artists during that period at the Soci√©t√© des Ind√©pendants. In 1900, Paule‚Äôs sister married Paul Val√©ry, a French poet and essayist. After this union, Paule resided with the couple in Morisot's home, where she produced some of her most well-known work.*Manet, Julie, Rosalind de Boland Roberts, and Jane Roberts. Growing Up with the Impressionists: The Diary of Julie Manet. London: Sotheby's Publications, 1987. She went on to further exhibit two other works at the Salon d'Automne in 1904 and then twelve works at Le Salon des Tuileries in 1926. Gobillard continued painting and lived until 1946, when she died in Paris.  Legacy  In 1983, then-Philippine First Lady Imelda Marcos reportedly bought fifty-two paintings of Gobillard for US$273,000 (US$640,141.14 in 2013 dollars) from the Hammer Galleries, a New York-based art gallery as part of her extravagant overseas spending sprees during her husband's political reign. The paintings are presently being litigated by the Presidential Commission on Good Government until the present day. On 30 June 2004, more than 100 of her paintings and drawings from the collection of her nephew, Fran√ßois Val√©ry were auctioned by the Parisian auction house Calmels‚ÄìCohen.

The event was organised by the \\"Vikingarnas Segels√§llskap\\" in Stockholm, Sweden The Sessan Cup or in Swedish \\"Sessanpokalen\\" is a trophy of a team race in Nordic Folkboat sailing.  Background  The teams, in the Sessan Cup, consist of two boats in each team competing in an overall fleet race. In the beginning, there were prices for both to the team and also an individual fleet race price. The individual part is now omitted. This is an international race and races have been held in, among others, cities like Berlin, Helsinki, Kerteminde, and Stockholm. The origin was the \\"Gothenburg international regatta\\", which was sailed in Gothenburg, Sweden, the first time 13 September 1952. The first winners were the team \\"G√∂teborgs Folkb√•tsklubb\\" and individually the well known Swedish boat designer Olle Enderlein from the city of Norrk√∂ping, Sweden. In 1957, the shipowner Ulf Trapp from Gotheburg did set up the \\"Sessanpokalen\\". The name derives from the Ulf Trapp‚Äôs ferry line, the Sessan line between Sweden and Denmark. All the ferries were named after princesses and in popular speech, the line became the \\"Sessan line\\" (\\"Sessan\\" in Swedish is short for \\"the Princess\\"). Later the name was adopted as the formal name for the ferry line. Ulf Trapp was the third generation shipowner and the family originated from Hannover in Germany. He was also a keen sailor and had three Nordic Folkboats. The most successful was F-SWE-448 \\"Atout\\" (\\"Atout\\" means asset or trump in French) built by John Josefsson&Son; B√•tvarv, Kungsviken 1957.

Facts According to Fyodorov rock music is \\"U.S.-instigated sabotage\\". After Russian rock musician Andrey Makarevich performed for Ukraine's internally displaced people in the Ukrainian town Slovyansk during the war in Donbass in August 2014 Fyodorov vowed to introduce legislation to strip Makarevich of all Russian state honors because his performance in Slovansk was \\"collaborating with the fascists\\". In September 2012, he stated that Russia and China were the leading powers in ending an alleged \\"colonization\\" of the world by the USA, where \\"everyone still plays by the American rules\\" . In a long video-interview from May 2014, Fyodorov predicted a violent coup d'√©tat in Moscow and Russia within a couple of years, organized by the Western powers, this is, a US-EU funded \\"color revolution\\", (as those previously taking place in Georgia or Ukraine), with collaboration from a local \\"5th Column\\". The aim of such a \\"revolution\\" would be the grabbing of Russia's natural resources, after destroying the federation as such, which would lead to a dramatic population reduction, as a result of civil war, children's sterilization, LGBT agenda, famine, etc., \\"like it happened with the American Indians, also as it happed with the African Americans during age of slavery and segregation\\". This would take place as a continuation of NATO's policy towards the former Warsaw Pact countries. However, he stated, newborn People's Republics in Donetsk and Lugansk (collectively also known as Novorossia) were a hindrance to NATO strategy and a sign of popular reaction against US-EU's imperialism, able to encourage other former URSS citizens in Ukraine to break free from the Kiev government, and turn the course of events away from Western world dominance. Fyodorov also said that genocide and terror, sponsored by NATO, were taking place in Ukraine to a much larger extent than generally thought, using foreign mercenaries and Neo-nazis to terrorize and subdue the local population. Fyodorov said that his mass movement PLM (People's Liberation Movement, in Russian NOD, –ù–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ- –æ—Å–≤–æ–±–æ–¥–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –¥–≤–∏–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ, sometimes known also as NLM, National Liberation Movement) had 100.000 members. In March 2015, he claimed that the recent assassination of the Russian opposition politician Boris Nemtsov had been organized by the CIA. In June 2015, he claimed that Russia¬¥s acknowledgment of the independence of the Baltic states in 1991 had been illegal, and took initiative to the Russian State Prosecutor¬¥s investigations on this subject . In September 2017, he stated in an interview that the crisis surrounding North Korea¬¥s nuclear program was that of a situation with freedom fighters battling against the world hegemony of the USA, who however seemed to be acting increasingly cowardly, when facing even small threats.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtiaguFKVuo References External links *International Association ‚ÄúFor Sovereignty‚Äù Manifest 1963 births 21st-century Russian politicians Living people Members of the State Duma (Russian Federation) People from Saint Petersburg Russian nationalists United Russia politicians Soviet military personnel of the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War ","title":"Yevgeny Alexeyevich Fyodorov"},{"id":"41240967","title":"List of power stations in Eritrea"},{"id":"41241025","text":"The Hotel John Marshall, first opened in 1929, was one of the leading hospitality establishments in downtown Richmond, Virginia. After the hotel closed in 2004, the building was renovated into upscale residential apartments that opened in December 2011.  Original development  The Hotel John Marshall, located on Fifth Street between Franklin and Grace in downtown Richmond, Virginia, opened on October 30, 1929, the day after the Wall Street Crash.Harry Kollatz Jr., \\"A Grand Lady's Revival\\", Richmond Magazine, March 2012 The opening night ceremony included dinner for 600 guests, amongst which were both the City Mayor, J. Fulmer Bright, and the Virginia Governor Harry F. Byrd. The hotel's construction was funded by businessman Thomas Gresham, of the Richmond Hotels, Inc., to which hotel group The John Marshall originally belonged.Andy McCutcheon, \\"Memories Are Rich with Life and Times of Hotel Once Richmond Region's Best\\", Virginia, July 1994 Architect Marcellus E. Wright Sr., who had studied at The Philadelphia School of Applied Art, designed the 16-story building in a neoclassical style with touches of deco and Moorish ornament. It cost $2 million to build, and the general contractor was Wise Granite and Construction Co. With 418 guest rooms, 500 bathrooms, 2 restaurants in ballrooms in the lobby and a roof garden ballroom on the 16th floor, it was the largest hotel in the state when it opened. It is said that the name was chosen by a suggestion contest, with the winning name paying tribute to Chief Justice John Marshall, whose house, now a museum, sits only a few blocks away.  Social history  When the hotel opened, it advertised itself as \\"The Finest Hotel in the South\\": from radio outlets every room, a private switchboard manned by the Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Co., to the rooftop garden ballroom, it was considered both modern and luxurious. The height of the hotel's prestige was in the 1940s, when it had a staff of 400 (nearly one employee per guest room) and fed some 1,500 people a day in its restaurants. It had even begun attracting some permanent residents. During this time, the rooms, at $3/night, were more expensive than The John Marshall's chief competitors, The Jefferson or the now-demolished Richmond Hotel, which rented for $2/night.Karen Shugart, \\"Marshall's Return\\", Style Weekly, June 21, 2011 Due to its proximity to the State Capitol, three blocks away, the Hotel hosted many political events. Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, and Ronald Reagan attended functions there, as well as Prime Minister Winston Churchill. It was a tradition for the outgoing state governor to meet governor-elect at the hotel on inauguration day, to proceed to the Capitol together. In 1985 Governor Douglas Wilder celebrated victory as first African-American to become Lieutenant Governor in the same room where he'd waited tables as a young man. Entertainment stars also frequented the hotel, which counted amongst its guests Elvis Presley, Vincent Price, and Elizabeth Taylor.Carol Hazard, \\"New Chapter Awaits the John Marshall\\", Richmond Times- Dispatch, May 16, 2011 In 1954, the hotel added a wing of extra room from its north side, and in 1963 an exposition hall opened for retail and meeting use.  Hotel remodel and closure  In an effort to keep up with changing tastes, in 1978 the hotel went through a significant remodel, with tile paving, gold leaf, and 18' atrium in stainless steel. Despite this, the development of large new hotels that could host conventions, such as the Omni and Marriott, took a toll on the John Marshall's business in the 1980s. In 1988 the remaining staff of 175 were laid off and 60,000 pieces of hotel memorabilia were auctioned off, from chandeliers to dining room demitasse spoons. The hotel closed it doors on May 31, 1988, leaving seven employees behind to keep up maintenance on the empty building. The hotel re-opened in limited capacity in 1999, after Gilbert Granger, former mayor of Williamsburg, Virginia, had bought it for $3.16 million: 70 rooms were then in use, and the hotel hosted a Martini Kitchen & Bubble Bar. The hotel ran in this manner till it closed its doors again in 2004.  Residential redevelopment  In 2005, Virginia Atlantic Development, Inc., based out of Hampton Roads, acquired the property. Dominion Realty Partners came on board in 2007, and so began a $70 million remodel, including $40 million in financing from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and both state and historic tax credits. The general contractor for the project was Choate Construction. The development team restored the lobby to original 1930s appearance, as well as having the hotel's famous rooftop sign, now rusted, remade in new 9' letters to match the original. Holiday Signs, the designer, had the new letters hauled by crane to the roof on April 11, 2011.Tom Kapsidelis, \\"Historic Hotel Reinstalls Landmark Sign\\", Richmond Times-Dispatch, April 11, 2011 LED bulbs were used, running at only 30% of the energy consumption of the original sign, but they were made to look like light bulbs. The building reopened as The Residences at The John Marshall, 238 downtown luxury apartments. It was observed that just as the hotel opened right after the Great Crash, so the apartments opened as the country was pulling out of Great Recession. The Residences kept the long- running John Marshall Barber shop, which is on only its 3rd owner/manager, Hugh Campbell. The mirrors, countertops, and chairs from the original shop were kept and refinished.Louis Llovio, \\"John Marshall Barber Shop Headed Home\\", Richmond Times-Dispatch, November 7, 2011 Greenleaf's Pool Room, a pool hall and bar managed by Jim Gottier, a former professional pool player, opened in the southeast corner of The John Marshall in August 2014. Gottier named the establishment after pool player Ralph Greenleaf and designed it to capture the ambience of a classic 1930's pool hall.Michael Thompson, \\"Richmond Biz Sense\\", August 15, 2014 While the roof garden ballroom was turned into penthouse units, the two lobby ballrooms were restored, including finding and restoring three of the original five chandeliers. Well-known Richmond caterer, Suzanne Wolstenholme, runs the ballrooms both as a luncheon venue and site for events such as small concerts and wedding receptions. As of spring 2013, the apartments were 100% leased, which has encouraged the building of other residential developments in downtown Richmond.

It became a major force in capitalist economies in the mid-19th century, based primarily on newspapers and magazines. In the 20th century, advertising grew rapidly with new technologies such as direct mail, radio, television, the internet and mobile devices. Advertising as a percent of Gross Domestic Product in the United States, 1919 to 2007 per Douglas Galbi. Between 1919 and 2007 advertising averaged 2.2 percent of Gross Domestic Product in the United States. Pre-modern history Bronze plate for printing an advertisement for the Liu family needle shop at Jinan, Song dynasty China. It is considered the world's earliest identified printed advertising medium. Egyptians used papyrus to make sales messages and wall posters. Commercial messages and political campaign displays have been found in the ruins of Pompeii and Arabia. Lost and found advertising on papyrus was common in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome. Wall or rock painting for commercial advertising is another manifestation of an ancient advertising form, which is present to this day in many parts of Asia, Africa, and South America. The tradition of wall painting can be traced back to Indian rock art paintings that date back to 4000 BCE.Bhatia (2000). Advertising in Rural India: Language, Marketing Communication, and Consumerism, 62, 68 In ancient China, the earliest advertising known was oral, as recorded in the Classic of Poetry (11th to 7th centuries BCE) of bamboo flutes played to sell candy. Advertisement usually takes in the form of calligraphic signboards and inked papers. A copper printing plate dated back to the Song dynasty used to print posters in the form of a square sheet of paper with a rabbit logo with \\"Jinan Liu's Fine Needle Shop\\" and \\"We buy high quality steel rods and make fine quality needles, to be ready for use at home in no time\\" written above and below.Eckhardt, G. and Bengtsson, A., \\"Pulling the White Rabbit Out of the Hat: Consuming Brands in Imperial China,\\" Advances in Consumer Research, [European Conference Proceedings] Vol. 8, 2008; Eckhardt, G. and Bengtsson, A., \\"A Brief History of Branding in China,\\" Journal of Macromarketing, Vol. 30, No. 3, 2010 is considered the world's earliest identified printed advertising medium.Hong Liu, Chinese Business: Landscapes and Strategies (2013), p. 15. Edo period LEL flyer from 1806 for a traditional medicine called Kinseitan In Europe, as the towns and cities of the Middle Ages began to grow, and the general populace was unable to read, instead of signs that read \\"cobbler\\", \\"miller\\", \\"tailor\\", or \\"blacksmith\\" would use an image associated with their trade such as a boot, a suit, a hat, a clock, a diamond, a horse shoe, a candle or even a bag of flour. Fruits and vegetables were sold in the city square from the backs of carts and wagons and their proprietors used street callers (town criers) to announce their whereabouts for the convenience of the customers. The first compilation of such advertisements was gathered in Les Crieries de Paris (Street criers of Paris), a thirteenth-century poem by Guillaume de la Villeneuve.Aime√© Boutin, \\"Sound Memory: Paris Street Cries in Balzac's Pere Goriot,\\" French Forum, Volume 30, Number 2, Spring 2005, pp. 67‚Äì78, Three major forms of advertisement existed during the pre-printing period (before the 15th- century); those forms were trademarks (moon, stars etc.), town criers and sign boards: * Trademarks: The practice of attaching seals or marks to products was widespread in antiquity. Around 4,000 years ago, producers began by attaching simple stone seals to products which, over time, were transformed into clay seals bearing impressed images, often associated with the producer's personal identity.Wengrow, David., \\"Prehistories of Commodity Branding,\\" Current Anthropology,Vol. 49, No. 1, 2008, pp. 7‚Äì34 Some of the earliest use of maker's marks, dating to about 1,300 BCE, have been found in India.Khan, M. and Mufti, S.U., The Hot History & Cold Future of Brands, Journal of Managerial Sciences, vol. 1, no. 1, 2007, pp. 75‚Äì87, http://qurtuba.edu.pk/jms/default_files/JMS/1_1/5_saif_ullah.pdf Online:] By the medieval period, hallmarks were applied to high value goods such as precious metals, and assayers were appointed by governments to administer the system and ensure product quality.Dodd, E.C., Byzantine Silver Stamps, [Dumbarton Oaks Studies] Vol. 7, Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection, 1961, pp. 23‚Äì35 * Town criers: In ancient towns and cities, where the majority of citizens were illiterate, town-criers were appointed to call out official announcements and general news. Before long, private individuals began to employ public criers to act as an auctioneer.Sampson, S., A History of Advertising from the Earliest Times, Chatto and, Windus, 1875, p. 35 At the same time, itinerant hawkers developed a system of street cries to promote their goods and services.Kelley, V., \\"The Streets for the People: London's Street Markets 1850‚Äì1939, Urban History, June, 2015, pp. 1‚Äì21, These street cries provided an essential public service before the advent of mass media.Garrioch, D., \\"Sounds of the City: the soundscape of early modern European towns,\\" Urban History, 2003, Vol. 30, no. 1, pp. 5-25, abstract Saracens Head pub sign, Bath, England *Sign-boards: The use of commercial signage has a very ancient history.

The very first weekly gazettes appeared in Venice in the early 16th-century. From there, the concept of a weekly publication spread to Italy, Germany and Holland.McIntyre, J., \\"The 'Avvisi' of Venice: Toward an Archaeology of Media Forms.\\" Journalism History 14#2, 1987, p. 68 In Britain, the first weeklies appeared in the 1620s, and its first daily newspaper was The Daily Courant published from 1702 to 1735.Clarke, B., From Grub Street to Fleet Street: An Illustrated History of English Newspapers to 1899 (Ashgate, 2004; Hunt, M., \\"Hawkers, Bawlers, and Mercuries: Women and the London Press in the Early Enlightenment\\", Women & History, Vol. 3, no. 9, 1984 pp. 41‚Äì68; Maxted, U., 'Mallet, Elizabeth (fl. 1672‚Äì1706)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press, 2004) accessed 27 May 2015 Almost from the outset, newspapers carried advertising to defray the cost of printing and distribution.Barr√®s-Baker, M.C., An Introduction to the Early History of Newspaper Advertising, [Brent Museum and Archive Occasional Publications, No. 2], Brent Heritage Services, 2006, The earliest commercial advertisements were for books and quack medicines, but by the 1650s, the variety of products being advertised had increased markedly.Turner, E.E., The Shocking History of Advertising, New York, Ballantine Books, 1980, p. 16 Advances in printing allowed retailers and manufacturers to print handbills and trade cards. For example, Jonathon Holder, a London haberdasher in the 1670s, gave every customer a printed list of his stock with the prices affixed. At the time, Holder's innovation was seen as a \\"dangerous practice\\" and an unnecessary expense for retailers.Sampson, S., A History of Advertising from the Earliest Times, Chatto and, Windus, 1875, p. 25 The earliest trade cards were not cards at all, instead they were printed on paper and did not include illustrations. By the 18th century, however, they were printed on the more substantial card and typically bore the tradesmen's name and address, and before street numbering was in common use, often included a long-winded set of directions on how to locate the store or premises. With the advent of commercial engraving and lithography, illustrations became a standard feature of even the most humble trade card. Eventually trade cards evolved into business cards, which are still in use today.\\"Trade Cards,\\" in The Encyclopedia of Ephemera: A Guide to the Fragmentary Documents of Everyday Life for the Collector, Curator, and Historian, Maurice Rickards (ed), Psychology Press, 2000, pp. 6‚Äì7, 334‚Äì335 19th century In June 1836, √âmile de Girardin editor of the Paris newspaper La Presse was the first to rely on paid advertising to lower its price, extend its readership and increase its profitability. His formula was soon copied by all titles. Early print advertisements were used mainly to promote books and newspapers, which became increasingly affordable with advances in the printing press; and medicines, which were increasingly sought after as modern people rejected traditional cures. However, false advertising and \\"Quackery\\" became common. British newspapers in the 1850s and 1860s appealed to the increasingly affluent middle-class that sought out a variety of new products. The advertisements announced new health remedies as well as fresh foods and beverages. The latest London fashions were featured in the regional press. The availability of repeated advertising permitted manufacturers to develop nationally known brand names that had a much stronger appeal than generic products.Beverley Ann Tudor, \\"Retail Trade Advertising in the 'Leicester Journal' and the 'Leicester Chronicle' 1855‚Äì71.\\" European Journal of Marketing 20#9 (1986) pp. 41‚Äì56. A leadership position in British advertising was held by Cope Bros & Co tobacco company, founded in Liverpool in 1848 by Thomas and George Cope. Smoking, of course, had been common for centuries, but the innovations consisted in brand names, heavy advertising, and market segmentation according to class. An innovative appeal was to health consciousness; the ads directed at the middle-class men promised that \\"smoke not only checks disease but preserves the lungs.\\" A rugged heavy taste was pitched to working men, soldiers and sailors, while \\"delicately fragrant\\" was part of the appeal to the upper-class. The packaging was attractive, posters were omnipresent to show that smoking was a normal part of English life; lobbying was used to undercut the anti-tobacco lobby.A. V. Seaton, \\"Cope's and the Promotion of Tobacco in Victorian England.\\" European Journal of Marketing (1986) 20#9 pp. 5‚Äì26. Advertising agencies =Great Britain= In Britain, outdoor advertising was based on hoardngs (billboards): England 1835, by John Orlando Parry In London Thomas J. Barratt was hailed as \\"the father of modern advertising\\".He was first described as such in T F G Coates, 'Mr Thomas J Barratt, \\"The father of modern advertising\\"', Modern Business, September 1908, pp. 107‚Äì115.Matt Haig, Brand failures: the truth about the 100 biggest branding mistakes of all time, Kogan Page Publishers, 2005, pp. 219, 266.Nicholas Mirzoeff, The visual culture reader, Routledge, 2002, p. 510. Working for the Pears Soap company, Barratt created an effective advertising campaign for the company products, which involved the use of targeted slogans, images and phrases. One of his slogans, \\"Good morning. Have you used Pears' soap?\\" was famous in its day and into the 20th century.Eric Partridge, Paul Beale, A Dictionary of Catch Phrases: British and American, from the Sixteenth Century to the Present Day, Routledge, 1986, p. 164. An advertising tactic that he used was to associate the Pears brand with high culture and quality. Most famously, he used the painting Bubbles by John Everett Millais as an advertisement by adding a bar of Pears soap into the foreground. Barratt continued this theme with a series of adverts of well groomed middle-class children, associating Pears with domestic comfort and aspirations of high society. A 1900 British ad for soap Barratt introduced many of the crucial ideas that lie behind successful advertising and these were widely circulated in his day. He constantly stressed the importance of a strong and exclusive brand image for Pears and of emphasizing the product's availability through saturation campaigns. He also understood the importance of constantly reevaluating the market for changing tastes and mores, stating in 1907 that \\"tastes change, fashions change, and the advertiser has to change with them. An idea that was effective a generation ago would fall flat, stale, and unprofitable if presented to the public today. Not that the idea of today is always better than the older idea, but it is different ‚Äì it hits the present taste.\\" =United States= In the United States around 1840, Volney B. Palmer set up the first advertising agency in Philadelphia. In 1842 Palmer bought large amounts of space in various newspapers at a discounted rate then resold the space at higher rates to advertisers. The actual ad ‚Äì the copy, layout, and artwork ‚Äì was still prepared by the company wishing to advertise; in effect, Palmer was a space broker. The situation changed in the late 19th century when the advertising agency of N.W. Ayer & Son was founded in New York. It planned, created, and executed complete advertising campaigns for its customers. It created a number of memorable slogans for firms such as De Beers, AT&T; and the U.S. Army.Ralph Hower, The History of an Advertising Agency: N. W. Ayer & Son 1869‚Äì1949 (1949) p. 185. J. Walter Thompson Co. promotes high-powered advertisement, 1903 By 1900 the advertising agency had become the focal point of creative planning, and advertising was firmly established as a profession. At first, agencies were brokers for advertisement space in newspapers. N. W. Ayer & Son was the first full-service agency to assume responsibility for advertising content. N.W. Ayer opened in 1869, and was located in Philadelphia. The amount of space available in newspapers grew rapidly. The Boston Transcript published in 19,000 \\"agate lines\\" Of advertising in 1860, 87,000 in 1900, and 237,000 in 1918.Daniel Starch, Advertising Principles (1927) p. 485 In 1893, 104 companies spent over $50,000 each on national advertising; most sold patent medicines, which faded away after the federal food and drug legislation of the early 20th century. Seven innovators had emerged in the big time: Quaker Oats, Armour meat, Cudahy meat, American Tobacco Company, P. Lorillard tobacco, Remington Typewriters, and Procter & Gamble soap. By 1914, two thirds of the top advertisers came from just five industries: 14 food producers, 13 in automobiles and tires, nine in soap and cosmetics, and four in tobacco.Daniel Pope, The making of modern advertising (1983) pp. 42‚Äì46. Agencies were forever breaking up and reforming, especially when one executive would split taking with him a major client and his team of copywriters.Hower, The History of an Advertising Agency (1949) pp. 58‚Äì59. =France= In the late 19th century in France, Charles- Louis Havas extended the services of his news agency, Havas to include advertisement brokerage, making it the first French group to organize.  Since 1900: Global Advertising in the developing world was dominated by agencies in the imperial powers, especially from London and Paris.Ciochetto, Globalisation and Advertising in Emerging Economies: Brazil, Russia, India and China (2013) p. 95 J. Walter Thompson became the first American agency to expand internationally with the opening of J. Walter Thompson London in 1899. It expanded across the globe, becoming one of the first American agencies in Egypt, South Africa and Asia. Much of the pressure to expand came from General Motors, which wanted to export its automobiles worldwide.Dawn Spring, \\"The Globalization of American Advertising and Brand Management: A Brief History of the J. Walter Thompson Company, Proctor and Gamble, and US Foreign Policy.\\" Global Studies Journal (2013). 5#4 Ford turned to N.W. Ayer, which began its expansion in Europe and Latin America in the 1930s. The typical policy was to put an American manager in charge, and hire a staff drawn from locals who had a better understanding of the language and the culture. In 1941‚Äì42, however, Ayer closed its foreign offices and decided to concentrate on the American market.Hower, 'The History of an advertising agency: N.W. Ayer & Son at work, 1869‚Äì1949.\\" (1949) pp. 140‚Äì146, 187. In 2011, spending on advertising reached $143 billion in the United States and $467 billion worldwide. Today, internationally, the largest (\\"big four\\") advertising conglomerates are Interpublic, Omnicom, Publicis, and WPP.

Advertising increased dramatically in the United States after 1870 as industrialization expanded the supply of manufactured products to a very large market. In order to profit from this higher rate of production, industry needed to recruit workers as consumers of factory products. It did so through the invention of mass marketing designed to influence the population's economic behavior on a larger scale.Ewen, Captains of Consciousness (1976), p. 33. \\"As Ford's massive assembly line utilized 'extensive single-purpose machinery' to produce automobiles inexpensively and at a rate that dwarfed traditional methods, the costly machinery of advertising that Coolidge had described set out to produce consumers, likewise inexpensively and at a rate that dwarfed traditional methods.\\" Total advertising volume in the United States grew from about $200 million in 1880 to nearly $3 billion in 1920. In the 1910s and 1920s, many ad men believed that human instincts could be targeted and harnessed ‚Äì \\"sublimated\\" into the desire to purchase commodities. Edward Bernays, a nephew of Sigmund Freud, promoted the approach making him a pioneer of modern cigarette advertising. Glantz argues, \\"it was really the tobacco industry, from the beginning, that was at the forefront of the development of modern, innovative, advertising techniques.\\"Stanton Glantz in Mad Men Season 3 Extra ‚Äì Clearing the Air ‚Äì The History of Cigarette Advertising, part 1, min 3:38 In the 1920s, under Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, the American government promoted advertising. Hoover himself delivered an address to the Associated Advertising Clubs of the World in 1925 called 'Advertising Is a Vital Force in Our National Life.\\" In October 1929, the head of the U.S. Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce, Julius Klein, stated \\"Advertising is the key to world prosperity.\\" This was part of the \\"unparalleled\\" collaboration between business and government in the 1920s, according to a 1933 European economic journal. Advertising was a vehicle for cultural assimilation, encouraging immigrants to exchange their traditional habits and tastes in favor of a modern American lifestyle. An important tool for influencing immigrant workers was the American Association of Foreign Language Newspapers (AAFLN). The AAFLN was primarily an advertising agency but also gained heavily centralized control over much of the immigrant press. Canadian media market In 1900, most Canadian newspapers were local affairs, designed primarily to inform local partisans about the provincial and national political scene. The publishers depended on loyal partisan subscribers, as well as contracts for public printing controlled by the political parties. With the rise of national advertising agencies after 1900, a major transformation was underway. The advertisers wanted them to reach the maximum possible circulation, regardless of partisanship. The result was a series of consolidations yielding much larger, largely nonpartisan newspapers, which depended more heavily on advertising revenue than on subscriptions from loyal party members. By 1900, three-fourths of the revenue of Toronto newspapers came from advertising. About two thirds of the newspapers' editorial pages loyally supported either the Conservative or the Liberal party, while the remainder were more independent. Across the board, the news pages increasingly featured more objectivity and bipartisanship, and the publishers were mostly focused on advertising revenues that were proportionate to overall circulation. A newspaper that appealed only to one party cut its potential audience in half. Simultaneously, the rapid growth of industry in Ontario and Quebec, coupled with the rapid settlement of the prairies, produced a large more affluent newspaper-reading population. The result was a golden age for Canadian newspapers peaking about 1911. Many papers failed during the war era. Advertising agencies in 1915 gained a major advantage with the arrival of the Audit Bureau of Circulations, which for the first-time provided reliable data on circulation, as opposed to the partisan boasting and exaggeration that had been the norm. the agencies now had a stronger hand in bargaining for lower advertising rates. The 1920s became a time of consolidation, budget-cutting and dropping of traditional party affiliation. By 1930 only 24% of Canada's dailies were partisan, 17% were \\"independent\\" partisan, and the majority, 50%, had become fully independent.Russell Johnston, \\"Partisan Politics, Market Research, and Media Buying in Canada, 1920,\\" Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly (2006) 83#4 Sex and psychology 1916 Ladies' Home Journal version of the famous ad At the turn of the 20th century, there were few career choices for women in business; however, advertising was one of the few. Since women were responsible for most of the purchasing done in their household, advertisers and agencies recognized the value of women's insight during the creative process. Helen Lansdowne Resor at J. Walter Thompson Agency, was one of the pioneers. In 1911, the Woodbury Soap Company became the first to use images of sexual contact to sell a product. Their ad slogan, created by Helen Lansdowne, claimed that women who used the soap would have \\"Skin You Love To Touch\\". Her copy promised the soap would increase the beauty of one's skin; it offered a color print and a week's supply of the soap for 10 cents. The slogan became so popular that Woodbury used it until the 1940s. Albert Lasker said the ad's use of sex appeal made it one of three great landmarks in advertising history. It was ranked 31st on Advertising Age's list of the top 100 campaigns of the 20th century.See \\"Resor, Helen Lansdowne (1886‚Äì1964)\\" in Advertising Age Sept 15, 2003 Nudity In 1936, Woodbury was one of the first companies to use nudity in its advertisements. The ad, known as \\"The Sun Bath\\", was photographed by Edward Steichen and showed a nude woman lying on stairs on her side with her back to the camera. The text advertised that Woodbury Soap was now enriched with \\"filter sunshine\\". Many celebrities appeared in advertisements for Woodbury Soap.Rodger Streitmatter, Sex sells!: The media's journey from repression to obsession (2004) In international perspective, a 2008 comparison of nudity in advertising in Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, South Korea, Thailand, and the United States reveals that China and the United States have the most demure ads, while Germany and Thailand exposed more of the female body. There is little variation in male undress.Michelle R. Nelson and Hye-Jin Paek, \\"Nudity of female and male models in primetime TV advertising across seven countries,\\" International Journal of Advertising (2008) 27#5 pp. 715‚Äì744 Psychology In the early 20th century, psychologists Walter D. Scott and John B. Watson contributed applied psychological theory to the field of advertising. Scott said, \\"Man has been called the reasoning animal but he could with greater truthfulness be called the creature of suggestion. He is reasonable, but he is to a greater extent suggestible\\".Benjamin, L.T., & Baker, D.B. 2004. Industrial-organizational psychology: The new psychology and the business of advertising.

He demonstrated this through his advertising technique of a direct command to the consumer. The former chair at Johns Hopkins University, John B. Watson was a highly recognized psychologist in the 1920s. After leaving the field of academia he turned his attention towards advertising where he implemented the concepts of behaviorism into advertising. This focused on appealing to the basic emotions of the consumer: love, hate, and fear. This type of advertising proved to be extremely effective as it suited the changing social context which led to heavy influence of future advertising strategy and cemented the place of psychology in advertising.T.

As head of the Lord and Thomas agency, Lasker devised a copywriting technique that appealed directly to the psychology of the consumer. Women seldom smoked cigarettes; he told them if they smoked Lucky Strikes they could stay slender. Lasker's use of radio, particularly with his campaigns for Palmolive soap, Pepsodent toothpaste, Kotex products, and Lucky Strike cigarettes, not only revolutionized the advertising industry but also significantly changed popular culture.Arthur W. Schultz, \\"Albert Lasker's Advertising Revolution,\\" Chicago History, Nov 2002, Vol. 31#2 pp. 36‚Äì53 Lasker had an inquiring mind about what advertising was and how it worked. Lasker believed that advertising consisted of news and information was news, He changed his mind when a colleague Johnny Kennedy told him, \\"News is a technique of presentation, but advertising is a very simple thing. I can give it to you in three words, it is 'salesmanship in print'\\".Jeffrey L. Cruikshank & Arthur W. Schultz, The Man Who Sold America, pp. 54‚Äì56 Lasker and Kennedy used this concept with the 1900 Washer Co. (later Whirlpool). Their campaign was so successful that, within four months of running the first ad, they attracted additional clients and their \\"advertising spend\\" went from $15,000 a year to $30,000 a month. Within six months, their firm was one of the three or four largest advertisers in the nation. In 1908 Lasker recruited Claude C. Hopkins to the firm, specifically to work on the Van Camp Packaging Company (Van Camp's) account. The relationship lasted for 17 years. Lasker helped create America's infatuation with orange juice. Lord & Thomas acquired the Sunkist Growers, Incorporated account in 1908, when the citrus industry was in a slump. Lasker created campaigns that not only encouraged consumers to eat oranges, but also to drink orange juice.John Gunther, Taken at the Flood (1960) p. 72 Among Lasker's pioneering contributions was the introduction into public schools of classes that explained to young girls about puberty and menstruation (done to promote Kotex tampons). He is also credited as the creator of the soap opera genre, and using radio and television as media driven by advertising. Lasker took time off from business to help the presidential campaign of Republican Warren Harding in 1920, using high-powered advertising techniques that helped produce a massive landslide.John A. Morello, Selling the President, 1920: Albert D. Lasker, Advertising, and the Election of Warren G. Harding (2001) On the radio from the 1920s Advertisement for a live radio broadcast, sponsored by a milk company and published in the Los Angeles Times on May 6, 1930 In the early 1920s, the first radio stations were established by radio equipment manufacturers and retailers who offered programs in order to sell more radios to consumers. Madison Avenue early on recognized the importance of radio as a new advertising medium. Advertising provided the major funding for most stations in the United States, which never had a licensing fee for set users.Susan Smulyan, Selling radio: The commercialization of American broadcasting, 1920‚Äì1934 (Smithsonian Inst Press, 1994) Great Britain used the mandatory fee on set owners to fund the British Broadcasting Corporation, which to this day operates without commercials or advertising. However, the British government permitted commercial television in 1954 and commercial radio in 1972. Public service advertising, non-commercial advertising, public interest advertising, cause marketing, and social marketing are different terms for (or aspects of) the use of sophisticated advertising and marketing communications techniques (generally associated with commercial enterprise) on behalf of non-commercial, public interest issues and initiatives. In the United States, the granting of television and radio licenses by the FCC is contingent upon the station broadcasting a certain amount of public service advertising. To meet these requirements, many broadcast stations in America air the bulk of their required public service announcements during the late night or early morning when the smallest percentage of viewers are watching, leaving more day and prime time commercial slots available for high-paying advertisers. Public service advertising in the United States reached its height during the world wars.George Creel, How we advertised America: The first telling of the amazing story of the Committee on Public Information that carried the gospel of Americanism to every corner of the globe (1920).Thomas A. Hollihan, \\"Propagandizing in the interest of war: A rhetorical study of the committee on public information.\\" Southern Journal of Communication 49#3 (1984): 241‚Äì257. During WWII President Roosevelt commissioned the creation of The War Advertising Council (now known as the Ad Council) which is the United States' largest developer of PSA campaigns on behalf of government agencies and non-profit organizations, including the longest-running public service campaign, Smokey Bear.Dannagal Goldthwaite Young, \\"Sacrifice, consumption, and the American way of life: Advertising and domestic propaganda during World War II.\\" The Communication Review 8#1 (2005) pp. 27‚Äì52.Robert Griffith, \\"The Selling of America: The Advertising Council and American Politics, 1942‚Äì1960.\\" Business History Review 57#3 (1983): 388‚Äì412 in JSTOR 1930s and World War II Advertising came under heavy pressure in the 1930s. The Great Depression forced businesses to drastically cut back on their advertising spending. Layoffs and reductions were common at all agencies. The New Deal furthermore aggressively promoted consumerism, and minimized the value or need of advertising. Historian Jackson Lears argues that \\"By the late 1930s, though, corporate advertisers had begun a successful counterattack against their critics.\\" They rehabilitated the concept of consumer sovereignty by inventing scientific public opinion polls, and making it the centerpiece of their own market research, as well has the key to understanding politics. George Gallup, the vice president of Young and Rubicam, and numerous other advertising experts, led the way. Moving into the 1940s, the industry played a leading role in the ideological mobilization of the American people for fighting the Nazis and Japanese in World War II. As part of that effort, they redefined the \\"American Way of Life\\" in terms of a commitment to free enterprise. \\"Advertisers,\\" Lears concludes, \\"played a crucial hegemonic role in creating the consumer culture that dominated post-World War II American society.\\"Jean M. Converse,\\" Survey Research in the United States: Roots and Emergence 1960 (1987) pp. 114‚Äì124 Postwar era In the prosperous postwar era, millions of Americans moved into new housing, especially in the rapidly growing suburbs. They spent heavily on housing, appliances, furniture, clothing and automobiles. The coming of television in the 1950s dramatically enlarged the arena for advertising. With most families having automobiles, and more leisure time, travel holidays became much more common, and the motel and tourism industries eagerly supported large-scale advertising.Richard K. Popp, The Holiday Makers: Magazines, Advertising and Mass Tourism in Postwar America (2012). In the public service arena, the Ad Council aggressively promoted Americanism as a Cold War strategy, with campaigns such as the Freedom Train, the Crusade for Freedom, Religion in American Life, Adams for Piece, and Peoples Capitalism. The new Brand Names Foundation sponsored conferences, local campaigns, and educational programs to promote brand loyalty, as well as free enterprise.Dawn Spring, Advertising in the Age of Persuasion: Building Brand America, 1941‚Äì1961 (2011). In The Hidden Persuaders (1957) popular writer Vance Packard exposes the use of consumer motivational research and other psychological techniques, including depth psychology and subliminal tactics. They had been used to manipulate expectations and induce desire for products since the 1920s, but the popular audience was caught by surprise. He identified eight \\"compelling needs\\" that advertisers promise products will fulfill. According to Packard these needs are so strong that people are compelled to buy products to satisfy them. The book questions the morality of using these techniques.Gordon Di Renzo The American Catholic Sociological Review, Vol. 19, No. 4 (Dec., 1958) (Review) =Racial themes= Before the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, black people were largely missing from mainstream white advertising. Those who did appear typically followed the long-standing \\"hierarchy of skin color\\" whereby those with lighter skin tones were seen as being more socially and culturally acceptable than dark-skinned black people.Julia M. Bristor, Renee Gravois Lee, and Michelle R. Hunt. \\"Race and ideology: African-American images in television advertising.\\" Journal of Public Policy & Marketing (1995): 48‚Äì59. in JSTORJannette Lake Dates and William Barlow, eds., Split image: African Americans in the mass media (Howard University Press, 1993). Most national corporations before the 1960s ignored the black market, and paid little attention to working with black merchants or hiring blacks for responsible positions. Pepsi-Cola was a major exception, as the number two brand fought for parity with Coca-Cola. The upstart soda brand hired black promoters who penetrated into black markets across the South and the urban North. Journalist Stephanie Capparell interviewed six men who were on the team in the late 1940s: :The team members had a grueling schedule, working seven days a week, morning and night, for weeks on end. They visited bottlers, churches, \\"ladies groups,\\" schools, college campuses, YMCAs, community centers, insurance conventions, teacher and doctor conferences, and various civic organizations. They got famous jazzmen such as Duke Ellington and Lionel Hampton to give shout-outs for Pepsi from the stage. No group was too small or too large to target for a promotion.Stephanie Capparell, \\"How Pepsi Opened Door to Diversity.\\" CHANGE 63 (2007): 1‚Äì26 online. Quaker Oats 1909 newspaper ad directed at white consumers with stereotypical images and dolls. Pepsi advertisements avoided the stereotypical images common in the major media that depicted one-dimensional Aunt Jemimas and Uncle Bens whose role was to draw a smile from white customers. Instead it portrayed black customers as self- confident middle-class citizens who showed very good taste in their soft drinks. They were economical too, as Pepsi bottles were twice the size.Stephanie Capparell, The Real Pepsi Challenge: The Inspirational Story of Breaking the Color Barrier in American Business (2007). By the late 1960s, more than a few token blacks were hired at advertising agencies, and the sensitivity to the problem increased. The leading black magazines Essence and Jet routinely deplored racism in mainstream media, especially in the negative depictions of black men and women. However Essence and Jet in the 21st century themselves ran about a dozen ads a year, especially for skin lighteners, that were pervaded with \\"racism and White supremacy.\\"Vanessa Hazell and Juanne Clarke, \\"Race and Gender in the Media: A Content Analysis of Advertisements in Two Mainstream Black Magazines\\" Journal of Black Studies (2008) 39#1 pp. 5‚Äì21. in JSTOR =Tobacco= By the 1950s, fears of cancer from tobacco smoking caused consternation in the tobacco industry, which turned to advertisers for help in avoiding falling consumer demand and increased regulation. British and American agencies separately arrived at similar solutions. The Tobacco Industry Research Committee in the United States and the Tobacco Manufacturers' Standing Committee in Britain each assuaged public anxieties and encouraged the misperception that the cigarette makers were resolving the issues through filters and low tar formulations. The public relations approach was successful in the short run, but the accumulation of medical evidence led to a fall in smoking, heavier taxation, and increased regulation. The agencies responded with sophisticated advertising strategies designed to encourage adolescent smokers as well as to recruit new smokers in less-developed foreign markets.David T. Courtwright, \\"'Carry on Smoking': Public Relations and Advertising Strategies of American and British Tobacco Companies since 1950,\\" Business History (2005) 47#3 pp. 421‚Äì432. online Cable television from the 1980s The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the introduction of cable television and particularly MTV. Pioneering the concept of the music video, MTV ushered in a new type of advertising: the consumer tunes in for the advertising message, rather than it being a by-product or afterthought. As cable and satellite television became increasingly prevalent, specialty channels emerged, including channels entirely devoted to advertising, such as QVC, Home Shopping Network, and ShopTV Canada. On the Internet from the 1990s With the advent of the ad server, marketing through the Internet opened new frontiers for advertisers and contributed to the \\"dot-com\\" boom of the 1990s. Entire corporations operated solely on advertising revenue, offering everything from coupons to free Internet access. At the turn of the 21st century, a number of websites, including the search engine Google, started a change in online advertising by emphasizing contextually relevant ads based on an individual's browsing interests. This has led to a plethora of similar efforts and an increasing trend of interactive advertising. The share of advertising spending relative to GDP has changed little across large changes in media. For example, in the US in 1925, the main advertising media were newspapers, magazines, signs on streetcars, and outdoor posters. Advertising spending as a share of GDP was about 2.9 percent. By 1998, television and radio had become major advertising media. Nonetheless, advertising spending as a share of GDP was slightly lower ‚Äì about 2.4 percent. The advertising business model has also been adapted since the 1990s. In media for equity, advertising is not sold, but provided to start-up companies in return for equity. If the company grows and is sold, the media companies receive cash for their shares. Chinese advertising is moving heavily to the smartphone, leaving television behind. Companies in China are increasingly more focused on mobile advertisements than on television advertisements. Central roles are played by Chinese-based social networking sites Weixin (also known as WeChat), and Sina Weibo, and the efforts of Western companies, including Coca-Cola, Burberry, and North Face, to market to Chinese consumers through their smartphones.Alexandra Stevenson and Shanshan Wang. \\"A Jump to Mobile Ads in China.\\" New York Times, 22 Dec 2014. =Restrictions on advertising= Since the 1950s, the industry itself, or the government, has imposed some restrictions on advertising certain types of products, especially liquor and cigarettes. Tobacco bans exist in many major countries across the world and cover 2.3 billion people.World Health Organization, WHO report on the global tobacco epidemic, 2013: enforcing bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship (World Health Organization, 2013) online In the 1990s Quebec banned some advertising directed at children. The restrictions have hindered competition in the breakfast cereal market when compared with the rest of Canada.C. Robert Clark, \\"Advertising Restrictions and Competition in the Children's Breakfast Cereal Industry,\\" Journal of Law & Economics (2007) 50#4 pp. 757‚Äì780. in JSTOR In the United States in the 1960s, public health advocates focused on limiting the advertising of tobacco products. In 1971, cigarette advertisements were taken off of the air (television and radio). This led marketers to shift their money over to print media: billboards, newspapers, etc. In the 1980s, public health groups pressed for more comprehensive restrictions. This posed a problem for the United States due to the constitutional protections of freedom of expression under the First Amendment. However, corporate marketing messages are not granted the same protections as noncommercial speech. Advertising messages, or ‚Äúcommercial speech‚Äù include commercial advertising, promises, and solicitations. Although commercial speech has been subject to regulation in order to protect consumers, it is still granted certain rights under the first amendment. \\"Even a communication that does no more than propose a commercial transaction is entitled to the coverage of the First Amendment.\\" (Edenfield v. Fane, 1993) Since 1900: Europe O'Galop\\" of Bibendum, the Michelin Man, 1898 J. Walter Thompson became the first American agency to expand internationally with the opening of J. Walter Thompson London in 1899.Lynne Ciochetto, Globalisation and Advertising in Emerging Economies: Brazil, Russia, India and China (Routledge, 2013) p. 95 France Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet (1906‚Äì1996) was the most prominent leader of French advertising in the 20th century. He founded Publicis. After 1945 his little-known Paris-based advertising agency grew rapidly, becoming the world's fourth largest agency. It was a leader in promoting France's post-war economic boom, especially the expansion of the advertising industry. It was successful because of its close ties with top officials of the French government, its clever use of symbols to promote itself, and its ability to attract clients from widely diverse growing industries.Philippe Lorin, 5 Giants of Advertising (Assouline Pub., 2001). pp. 82‚Äì95Clark Hultquist, \\"Publicis and the French advertising world, 1946--1968\\" Essays in Economic & Business History (2009) 27: 61‚Äì76 The question of whether advertising reflects society or shapes society, can be seen in European models that diverged from the American style. In France, Michelin dominated the tire industry and was one of the leading advertisers; to this day its famous guidebooks are very widely used by upscale travelers. From 1894 to the present its symbol was Bibendum (the \\"Michelin Man\\" made of tires). He was a lord of industry, a master of all he surveyed, and a patriotic expounder of the French spirit. In the 1920s, Bibendum urged Frenchmen to adopt America's superior factory system, but to patriotically avoid using the \\"inferior\\" products of those factories. As automobiles diffused to the middle classes, Michelin advertising likewise shifted downscale, and its restaurant and hotel guides covered a broader range of price categories.Stephen L. Harp, Marketing Michelin.

French businessmen did not like the American tone, and were fearful of Americanization. The French market was heavily regulated and protected to repel foreign interests, and the American admen in Paris were not good at hiding their condescension and insensitivity.Clark Eric Hultquist, \\"Americans in Paris: The J. Walter Thompson Company in France, 1927‚Äì1968.\\" Enterprise and Society 4#03 (2003): 471‚Äì501. Britain As millions of American soldiers passed through Britain during the Second World War, there were fearsof an \\"Americanization\\" of British commerce and culture. The Marshall Plan explicitly required and upgrading of the marketing and organizational skills of British industry. There were fears among the leaders of the London advertising world of what the brash, rich Americans would do to them. Radio and television was off limits to advertising, because BBC relied on fees paid by owners of radio receivers. The question was whether the heavily funded American methods would prove irresistible. JWT London was an American owned advertising agency controlled by J. Walter Thompson in New York City. JWT London avoided being the bold apostle of the American style. Instead it is relied on soft persuasion, shedding its Americanness to adapt to the British understated style.Sean Nixon, \\"Apostles of Americanization? J. Walter Thompson Company Ltd, Advertising and Anglo-American Relations 1945‚Äì67,\\" Contemporary British History (2008) 22#4 pp. 477‚Äì499. Germany In the 1920s, most advertising was handled by manufacturing companies in-house. Numerous small advertising agencies handled purchase of space in the media, but did not design campaigns or the ads themselves. An important role was played by travelling salesmen in promoting products to wholesalers and retailers and providing feedback from the market to the producer.Pamela E. Swett, Selling under the Swastika: Advertising and Commercial Culture in Nazi Germany (2014) ch 1 During the Nazi era (1933‚Äì45), the advertising industry expelled its Jews, and came under the supervision of the \\"Ad Council for the German Economy,\\" a department of the propaganda ministry of Joseph Goebbels. The relationship was friendly, For the industry learned a great deal from the Nazi propaganda techniques. The industry promoted Hitler's favorite products, such as the promised Volkswagen automobile for the people, and the construction of autobahns. It emphasized the availability of trusted brands despite growing shortages after the war began in 1939. It helped support the regime, articulating a vision of consumption that was well aligned with the Nazi spirit. In some environments and social movements, such as with post-WW2 East Germany Stasi's zersetzung, criminology theorists estimated advertisement was used as a means to crime, the nature of the crime was the intentional exploitation of an individual to cause damage to the individual's ability to form social bonds and appropriate perceptions of the world. This is especially true in the case of manipulation, people take advantage of their underdeveloped social skills and exploit them for selfish gain, this was later criticized to be adopted by turpitude agents of modern advertising. Many major brands were off the market by 1944, because of severe shortages. When they returned after the war, they were welcomed as an index of normality and were not associated with Nazism.Swett, Selling under the Swastika (2014) ch 2‚Äì6 By the 1950s, German advertising agencies were starting to mimic American methods.Harm G. Schr√∂ter, \\"Die Amerikanisierung der Werbung in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland,\\" [\\"The Americanization of advertising in West Germany.\\"] Jahrbuch f√ºr Wirtschaftsgeschichte (1997), Issue 1, pp. 93‚Äì115, dates the Americanization to the 1960s.

Advertising America: The United States Information Service in Italy (1945‚Äì1956) (2009) Several American firms opened offices, including Young & Rubicon and Ogilvy & Mather.

Oliviero Toscani A dramatic example of how advertising nudged the Italian middle-class into modern consumer society appears in the heavily advertised automatic washing machine. It appeared on the Italian market in 1958 and by 1965, 23% of families had purchased one, reaching 42% by 1970. Advertisers hailed the mechanization of domestic tedium as the advent of a new women's \\"liberation.\\" Commentary appeared everywhere, from advertisements to the specialized press, to women's reviews. Architects and designers made room for the new marvel, as the promotional language celebrating the device became a chorus of praise for domestic appliances as the secret of \\"progress\\" and \\"freedom\\" and \\"liberation.\\" On the other hand, husbands still insisted on driving the family automobile; it was off-limits to the liberated female.Enrica Asquer, \\"La Signora Candy e la sua lavatrice: storia di un'intesa perfetta nell'Italia degli anni Sessanta.\\" [Mrs. Candy and her washing machine: a perfect love story in 1960s Italy] Genesis 1 (2006) pp. 1000‚Äì1022. Armando Testa Set up a full-service advertising agency in 1956, specializing in the new medium of television advertising. He was inspired by Eastern European animation techniques, and often use simple graphics like the blue hippo. His son Marco Testa, trained at Benton & Bowles in New York, and maintained the fast-paced, witty style.Tungate, Adland: A Global History of Advertising pp. 138‚Äì143 Emmanuelle Pirella, who trained at the Italian offices of Young & Rubicon and Ogilvy & Mather, emerged as a leading copywriter. Benetton gained worldwide attention for its saucy advertising, inspired by its art director Oliviero Toscani. He started with multicultural themes, tied together under the campaign \\"United Colors of Benetton\\" then became increasingly provocative with interracial groupings, and unusual sexual images, such as a nun kissing a priest.Tungate, Adland: A Global History of Advertising pp. 146‚Äì149  Since 1900: Asia and Africa Japan Dentsu is the dominant firm in Japan thanks to its origins as a media representative. It produced Japan's first newspaper advertisements as well as the first television commercials. It was established in 1901 as Japan Advertising Ltd. and Telegraphic Service Co. by Hoshiro Mitsunaga. In 1936, it sold off its news division to Doumei News Agency, to focus on advertising. In 1946, it purchased 16 small companies and set up operational bases in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, and Ky≈´sh≈´. Dentsu company now offers a range of services, from traditional and creative marketing to specialty disciplines such as sports marketing, investing in feature film production and acquiring broadcasting rights, PR, digital contents, and a growing range of communications services.Kotaro Sugiyama and Tim Andree. The Dentsu Way: Secrets of Cross Switch Marketing from the World's Most Innovative Advertising Agency (2010) China In the first 20 years of communist control of China (1947 to 1966) Mao Zedong tried to reverse the long-standing advertising practices of Chinese newspapers, considering it a capitalist infringement on the goals of socialism. Consumerism, which had been highly developed in Shanghai, was anathema, to Mao's peasant-based communist perspective. The regime emphasized maximum production rather than optimal consumption. The approach worsened the massive famines that happened when national resources were devoted to a highly inefficient factory production at the cost of basic food output. On the other hand, propaganda was highly developed art in the Communist Party, and so a sort of compromise was reached. Socialist-oriented advertising emphasized the collective good, rather than the benefits of products for the individual consumer.Karl Gerth, \\"Compromising with Consumerism in Socialist China: Transnational Flows and Internal Tensions in 'Socialist Advertising'\\", Past & Present (2013 Supplement) pp. 203‚Äì232 online Since 1980, the strength of the private economy, and advertising, has grown dramatically. By the 1980s much emphasis was placed on the role of advertising in promoting the Four Modernizations emphasized by Deng Xiaoping. Lip service is still paid to old Maoist ideals by recycling images of historic places and episodes, but it does not inhibit the growth of consumerism.Xin Zhao and Russell W. Belk, \\"Politicizing Consumer Culture: Advertising's Appropriation of Political Ideology in China's Social Transition,\\" Journal of Consumer Research (2008) 35#2 pp. 231‚Äì244 Since Chinese entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2002, its advertising industry has fundamentally changed. It has become the world's fastest-growing advertising market and the country with the largest pool of netizens. Major changes have come in terms of shifting cultural values, the growing role of brand names, the attractiveness of English- language titles to the younger generation, the redefinition of acceptable/offensive advertising, the very rapid growth of new media (especially the Internet and smart phones), the emergence of on-line shopping in a country with an underdeveloped system of department stores in shopping centers, and much more advanced techniques of managing advertising agencies.Kineta Hung, et al. \\"Advertising Research in the Post-WTO Decade in China,\\" Journal of Advertising (2012) 41#3 pp 121‚Äì146 India Many elements of Indian culture and industry have British roots, so that British advertising models usually work well. In 1991, the government dramatically liberalized Indian economy, opening it to international business. The emergence of a moderately affluent middle-class numbering in the hundreds of millions attracts multinational corporations and international advertisers.William M. O'Barr, \\"Advertising in India.\\" Advertising & Society Review 9#.3 (2008) pp: 1‚Äì33. onlineAruna Chandra, David A. Griffith, and John K. Ryans, \\"Advertising standardisation in India: US multinational experience\\" International Journal of Advertising (2002) 21#1 pp. 47‚Äì66 Advertising in India operates at two levels. Ads for high-value products appear in English- language papers such as The Hindu and The Madras Mail, which targeted Europeans and high-status Indians. By contrast, ads for low-value products are typically placed in vernacular papers and are aimed at a lower middle class with highly restricted spending power. The working class and peasant populations, with very low disposable incomes, are seldom targeted by the advertising agencies. Local merchants might use signs and posters to reach them.Douglas E. Haynes, \\"Advertising and the History of South Asia, 1880‚Äì1950\\" p. 363 Cricket is one sport where the Indians have had an international success, so that cricket stars are prominent endorsers in national advertising.Sumit Sharma, \\"Indian cricket players are becoming big winners for many advertisers,\\" Asian Wall Street Journal (May 11, 1998) p. 8 Subtle cultural norms can be easily transgressed. In 2002, widespread protests forced Hindustan Lever Ltd. (the Indian subsidiary of London-based Unilever) to cancel a television ad campaign for its fairness cream because of its portrayal of women. The campaign was built around the theme of a father lamenting \\"If only I had a son\\" while showing his problem: a dark-skinned, unattractive daughter. Fast-forward. She uses the Fair & Lovely cream and has become a gorgeous light-skinned beauty. Clad in a stylish miniskirt, she is a successful airline flight attendant and takes her proud father to dine at a five-star hotel. The All India Women's Democratic Association (AIDWA), a far left political organization, lodged a complaint with the National Human Rights Commission in New Delhi. It argued endorsing the traditional preference for sons strengthens gender discrimination, which is a major problem in India. Furthermore, said AIDWA, the ad perpetuated a culture of discrimination in a society where \\"fair skin\\" is synonymous with \\"beautiful.\\" The government's Ministry of Information and Broadcast sided with AIDWA and directed stations not to air the ads because they violated the Cable and Television Networks Act of 1995 which states that no advertisement shall be permitted which \\"derides any race, caste, color, creed and nationality\\" and furthermore states that, \\"Women must not be portrayed in a manner that emphasizes passive, submissive qualities and encourages them to play a subordinate secondary role in the family and society.\\" The minister told Parliament that if broadcasters do not regulate ad content the government will be forced to do so. The Mumbai-based Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI), a body of advertisers and media agencies, insisted that it should do the regulating not the government. ASCI had already told Hindustan Lever that its ad campaign was offensive and it was ended.Arundhati Parmar, \\"Objections to Indian ad not taken lightly\\" Marketing News (June 9, 2003) 37#12 pp. 4‚Äì9 Developing world During the decolonization era from the late 1940s to the 1970s, British and French firms operating in Africa and Asia at first largely ignored local, nationalistic aspirations. However they learned to adjust to exploit the new spirit of independence that was shaping consumer attitudes. The new emergence of a middle class was the target audience. Their advertising abandoned the traditional paternalistic attitude toward the natives. Instead there was a portrayal of locals as up-and-coming middle-class men in control of developing their nations. These more positive images assisted business operations during spells of military dictatorship, economic nationalism, and expropriation of foreign assets.Sephanie Decker, \\"Corporate Legitimacy and Advertising: British Companies and the Rhetoric of Development in West Africa, 1950-1970,\\" Business History Review (2007) 81#1 pp. 59‚Äì86 Tobacco advertising was especially important. For example, in Egyptian popular culture the cigar was associated with elites, the water pipe with a lower-class and traditional lifestyle, and the cigarette with the new middle class which was striving to make the transition to modernity. It was the third group that the cigarette industry targeted.Relli Shechter, \\"Reading advertisements in a colonial/development context: Cigarette advertising and identity politics in Egypt, 1919‚Äì1939.\\" Journal of social history 39#2 (2005): 483‚Äì503. in JSTOR Brazil is the largest country in Latin America, and number five in the world in terms of population. Its economy grew rapidly in the 21st century, until it began to stall in 2010. At that time it was the world's sixth-biggest advertising market, at $US 14.2 billion. Brazil in 2010 ranks #1 in deodorants, #2 in children's products, #3 in cosmetics, and #4 in automobile salesLaurel Wentz and Claudia Penteado, \\"Why so many agencies are storming road to Sao Paulo\\" Advertising Age (Dec. 6 2010) =Mexico= The start in 1994 of the North American Free Trade Agreement had a dramatic impact on the advertising industry in Mexico, with its 130 full service agencies and 270 smaller operations under the auspisces of the Mexican Association of Advertising Agencies. The flood of American brand-name products greatly expanded the scope of the advertising industry, and the Mexican agencies faced new competition from branch offices of international firms.Patrick McCurry, \\"Advertising in transition: agencies change their image to meet market demand\\" Business Mexico (Sept. 1992) 2#4, Vol. 2, pp. 4+ A key to the new market was that upscale consumers in Mexico typically display \\"malinchismo\\", which is a preference for imported American brands rather than local Mexican brands. As a result, American products are sold mostly to the middle class market, and their advertising agencies generally avoid working class and rural areas. They concentrate their efforts instead on Mexico City, Monterrey, and Guadalajara, which purchase 70 percent of the American imports.Linda Ueltschy, and John K. Ryans, Jr., \\"Employing standardized promotion strategies in Mexico: the impact of language and cultural differences,\\" International Executive (July 1997) 39#4 pp. 479+ Advertising battles in Mexico, include not only issues of quality, but issues of national authenticity. For example, in Mexico in the 1990s, two American exporters Procter & Gamble and Frito-Lay fought an advertising battle concerning whose potato chips are tastier, more natural, and more Mexican. Procter & Gamble challenged Frito-Lay's Sabritas which controls 80 percent of the $1 billion chip market.Jonathan Friedland, \\"P&G;, Frito-Lay in Mexican ‚Äì ad standoff,\\" Wall Street Journal (March 19, 1999).

A manga adaptation began serialization in ASCII Media Works' Dengeki Daioh from January 27, 2014. A 2-part sequel aired on September 29 and 30, 2014.  Plot  Buddy Complex revolves around the main character, Aoba Watase, an ordinary high school boy. He lived an average, everyday life commuting to high school in the city. On the first day back after summer break, Aoba is attacked by a giant robot that appears out of the sky. As he's pursued through the city, his classmate Hina Yumihara appears in a giant robot of her own. She rescues him, and tells him cryptically that \\"Dio is waiting,\\" before she sends Aoba into the future and then disappears. When Aoba wakes up, he finds himself over seventy years into the future, where the Free Pact Alliance and the Zogilia Republic are at war with each other, and there he meets a young pilot named Dio Junyou Weinberg. This begins Aoba's new life as a pilot of the Free Pact Alliance, and together with Dio, they would change the fate of the world. Characters  Main characters ; : Voiced by: Yoshitsugu Matsuoka : Aoba is the main protagonist. At 16 years old, he is first year student at Seio High School. Aoba is a bright, considerate young man. He excels at athletics, especially basketball. He was an ordinary Japanese high school student from 2014 who got transported into the year 2088 and now fights for the Free Pact Alliance. He is the pilot of the Coupling Valiancer Luxon, and later Luxon Next. He has exceptional compatibility as a Coupler. He was surprised to see Hina as the Zogilia pilot with no memories of him from the past and even tries to kill him when he offered his hand to her to come into Luxon's cockpit. Despite knowing that Hina was the enemy, Aoba doesn't want to fight her because she is the girl who saved his life. After another encounter with Hina and he talked with her, Aoba was almost convinced she was not the same Hina as the Hina Yumihara who saved him. But he doesn't seem to care about it anymore, when he invites Hina to join the Cygnus after her father's death, even though his effort to bring Hina to his side is ruined by Bizon. Later, he realizes she is indeed the same Hina who saved his life and he decides to save her from her fate. ; : Voiced by: K≈çki Uchiyama : Dio is the 16 year old ace pilot of the Free Pact Alliance. He is the pilot of Coupling Valiancer Bradyon and later Bradyon Next. He's calm and stoic, but he has a strong sense of justice in his heart. He usually looks down on Aoba.

She is actually a mecha pilot from the future who has a mission to protect Aoba from opposing mecha from the same future with her who wants to kill him. She sent Aoba into the future, where she had not yet met Aoba and served as a pilot of Zogilia Republic, enemy of the Free Pact Alliance. In Zogilia, Hina is the daughter of veteran Lieutenant Commander of Zogilian military, Viktor Ryazan.

He was one of the noble Germans who took part in the Crusade of 1197. Life Ulrich II was the eldest son of Duke Herman of Carinthia, who had married Agnes of Babenberg, daughter of Duke Henry Jasomirgott of Austria and former queen consort of Hungary. Still a minor when his father died in 1181, he initially was under guardianship of his maternal uncle Duke Leopold V of Austria. Therefore, he had to stand back when the Otakar rulers of Styria became extinct and Leopold concluded the 1186 Georgenberg Pact with Ottokar IV in order to reserve the right of succession for the Austrian House of Babenberg. His paternal uncle was Pellegrino of Ortenburg-Spanheim, who ruled as Patriarch of Aquileia from 1195 to 1204. In 1192 he made a donation to St. Paul's Abbey. Ulrich II came of age to rule independently from 1194 and, like his father, remained a loyal supporter of the Imperial Hohenstaufen dynasty. When Emperor Henry VI called for the German Crusade in 1195, the Carinthian duke was among the many nobles who undertook to go, even though he had scarcely reached adulthood. Starting in March 1197 these nobles with their troops left from the south of Italy and Sicily. The main fleet reached Acre in September 1197. The crusade ended after the fall of Sidon and Beirut. Henry VI died of a fever in Messina in October 1197. When they heard the news many of the higher-ranking nobles returning to Germany to protect their interests in the forthcoming Imperial election. Having returned to Germany, Ulrich participated in the election of Philip of Swabia in 1198. However, he fell ill shortly afterwards and became incapable of ruling, whereafter his younger brother Bernhard acted as regent. There is a record of the duke making another donation to Saint George's Abbey on 31 March 1199. According to the necrology of Seckau Abbey, Ulrich died on 12 August 1202.

Gameplay involves players navigating a customized avatar through Disney- inspired worlds fighting enemies, along with taking down bosses in multiplayer matches in competition with other teams. A version of the game for mobile devices called Kingdom Hearts Unchained œá, was released as the ninth installment of the series in Japan in September 2015, and worldwide in 2016. In April 2017, Unchained œá was rebranded as Kingdom Hearts Union œá[Cross]. It was rebranded once again in June 2020 to Kingdom Hearts Union œá Dark Road with the release of the stand alone game Kingdom Hearts Dark Road, the thirteenth installment in the series. Dark Road is accessed within Union œá. Kingdom Hearts œá is a prequel to the Kingdom Hearts series as a whole, taking place centuries prior. It takes place before the Keyblade War, which established the organization of the Kingdom Hearts universe as of the original game. The player assumes the role of a Keyblade wielder who joins one of five factions led by Keyblade Masters fighting for control of the limited light existing in the world. Unchained œá/Union œá acts as a sequel, retelling part of the story of Kingdom Hearts œá before diverging and telling a new story set after its events. The game's plot is connected to Kingdom Hearts III. The title refers to the œá-blade, a weapon central to the series' story arc. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road explores the origins of series antagonist Xehanort and his eventual turn to darkness. The game was designed as a playing experience that newcomers to the series could come to. Its presentation was compared to that of a fairy tale, as depicting the usual style of the series would have been difficult on the platform. Both Tetsuya Nomura and Yoko Shimomura, veterans from the main series, returned as director and composer respectively. The game received favorable reception from critics. A companion film, Kingdom Hearts œá Back Cover, was released as part of Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue in January 2017. Gameplay A player character fighting a Heartless Raid Boss in Kingdom Hearts Unchained œá. Kingdom Hearts œá is a role-playing video game set in the universe of Kingdom Hearts which includes original characters and locations as well as ones from Disney and Final Fantasy media properties. Before beginning, players create their own character. Players can customize the gender, hair, and clothing, and choose accessories themed after both Square Enix and Disney universes present in the Kingdom Hearts series. Story missions are unlocked by the player. After a certain amount of the available content has been completed, new story missions become available. Players navigate their surroundings by dragging their cursor across the screen. Players navigate different worlds, defeating monsters known as the Heartless. The base game is free to play, with optional microtransactions. Actions use up AP, which can be replenished by either waiting or by using potions, which can be earned or bought. Rare items such as special cards can also be purchased. Alongside the single-player mode, there is a multiplayer mode where teams of players take on Raid Bosses, gigantic Heartless with high HP. Enemies appear on-screen, and can be engaged by clicking on them. During the player's turn, three cards are randomly drawn from a deck of nine, each resulting in an attack. If the cards' combined strength and attached skills are insufficient to exhaust the enemy's HP, the heartless will counterattack. If the player survives this attack, or continues by spending additional AP, a new turn begins. Upon defeating an enemy, the player earns Lux (which unlocks rewards as it accumulates, but resets weekly), experience points (through which the player advances in level), and Munny (an in-game currency). The player also earns Fragments, cards based on the characters original to the Kingdom Hearts series and those from Disney and Final Fantasy franchises: the fragments are imbued with different properties depending on the character, such as physical or elemental strikes. Players can level up their cards to improve their attack and defense. Players can strengthen their Keyblade using materials found in each world, and new Keyblades are acquired as the story progresses. Each strengthens different types of cards; for example, Starlight is an all-around Keyblade offering boosts for Power-, Speed- and Magic-type cards, while the Snow White-inspired Treasure Trove is Power-type focused. The mobile version of the game, entitled Kingdom Hearts Unchained œá, shares multiple gameplay features with its browser counterpart: the main exception is that this version is tailored for a touch screen. The ability to travel freely between different Disney worlds is also replaced with a stage system. These stages, called quests, are confined to specific areas of specific worlds. Instead of spending AP on individual actions, AP is paid to start a quest, and the player can attack as many enemies, collect as many materials, and open as many chests as he or she can find before defeating a target Heartless. If the player's HP is fully depleted, a choice is offered between forfeiting all progress in the quest or continuing to fight by spending Jewels, a new general-purpose in-game currency. Lux is considered another name for character-leveling experience points. Clothing, hair, and accessories are obtained through Avatar Boards, which each contain an array of nodes on branching pathways. These nodes are unlocked, in set sequences, with Avatar Coins, and may also yield such benefits as increased limits for AP and HP. Cards from the browser version are here replaced by Medals, which are no longer drawn randomly in battle. Instead, each equipped Medal is presented one at a time, and the player is given the choice of attacking one enemy, attacking all enemies (dealing less damage), or using the special attack granted by the Medal (provided the Keyblade's special attack gauges are sufficiently filled). Medals can be combined with matching Medals to improve their special attacks. Synopsis Setting Kingdom Hearts œá is set in a world called Daybreak Town in the distant past, prior to the other games in the series. The game begins before the legendary Keyblade War, a conflict sparked due to disputes between Keyblade wielders over the light that created the world, triggering a calamity that reshaped the world into that seen in the rest of the Kingdom Hearts series. Prior to the war, a precognizant Keyblade Master known only as the Master of Masters bestows a Book of Prophecies to five of his six apprentices, the Foretellers, before disappearing. The book has the ability to manifest objects and people from the future, and contains an account of future events, from which the five Foretellers learn of a prophecy foretelling the world's destruction. To prevent this, the Foretellers use their books to manifest future worlds and defeat the Heartless infesting them to gather pieces of light, called Lux. Each Foreteller creates and leads their own \\"Union\\" themed around their individual animal icon: Unicornis, governed by Ira; Anguis, governed by Invi; Leopardus, governed by Gula; Vulpes, governed by Ava; and Ursus, governed by Aced. The player character, a newly awakened Keyblade wielder, chooses to support one of the Unions and works to ensure the chosen faction's supremacy. Kingdom Hearts Unchained œá takes place after the events of Kingdom Hearts œá in an alternate data worldline, with the player reliving the past to forget the events of the Keyblade War. Due to the Book of Prophecies' loss of power without the Master or Foretellers present, the Keyblade wielders instead visit simulated datascapes based on the various Disney worlds. Unchained œá initially repeats the story of the original, but diverges partway through the narrative. New stories feature the player forming a new team with four other Keyblade wielders, who become friends. Other major story events that do not involve the player are delivered via game updates, serving to expand on the story of Kingdom Hearts œá and continue the narrative after the events of the Keyblade War. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is set many years after the Keyblade War, between the events of Unchained œá and Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep. The story explores the origins of series antagonist Xehanort and his eventual turn to darkness. Kingdom Hearts œá story The player character awakens as a Keyblade wielder and is given a choice of joining one of five \\"Unions\\", after which a Dream Eater named Chirithy explains the player's role of destroying Heartless to collect Lux. Under Chirithy's direction, the player visits illusions of future worlds to carry out their mission. As they continue, Chirithy explains that the Foretellers have learned from the Book of Prophecies about a great battle in which the world will be consumed by darkness. To save the future, the Foretellers use the book's powers to project the future into their era, hoarding Lux to protect the world's light. The player befriends Ephemer, a Keyblade wielder from a rival Union who wishes to explore the Foretellers' tower in the center of town. The player agrees to help, but Ephemer disappears shortly thereafter. Later, the player meets another wielder from Ephemer's Union named Skuld, who is investigating his disappearance. Exploring the tower, the player and Skuld are caught by Ava, who challenges them to a duel. Upon her defeat, Ava reveals that she is recruiting Keyblade wielders to the Dandelions, a group who will be sent to another worldline to keep them out of the impending war so they may rebuild the world in its aftermath. She explains that Ephemer is one of those chosen, and offers the same to Skuld and the player; Skuld accepts, but the player is uncertain. As time passes, other wielders accuse one another of stealing Lux, and the Foretellers ‚Äì suspecting one among themselves to be a traitor ‚Äì begin rallying more wielders to their Unions to bolster their forces for the coming war. Seeking a solution, the player, Skuld, and Chirithy find Gula, who believes the only one who can stop the war is the now missing Master of Masters. Ava tracks down the Master's sixth apprentice, Luxu, who vanished to watch the war unfold as per the Master's instructions; believing Luxu to be the traitor, Ava attacks him, starting the war as prophesied. Skuld returns to the Dandelions while the player participates in the war alone, battling for as long as they can before collapsing in exhaustion. The war ends with the player as the sole survivor, reuniting with Chirithy, Skuld, and Ephemer before losing consciousness. Sometime later, Chirithy awakens the player and lies to them that the events surrounding the war were all a dream. Unbeknownst to them, Maleficent appears nearby ‚Äì having traveled back in time after being defeated by Sora and his friends ‚Äì and makes plans to conquer her world in the past. Kingdom Hearts Unchained œá / Union œá story A series of flashbacks set before the Keyblade War depicts the Master of Masters giving Ava a list of five Keyblade wielders who are to become the new Union leaders. Under his instructions, she gives each of the chosen a special rulebook to follow, but defies his orders by giving one of them, Brain, a Book of Prophecies. Another of the new leaders, Strelitzia, secretly follows the player throughout their journey, being fascinated with them. As the war starts and she realizes the player is not a Dandelion, she tries to find them and convince them to join, but she is ambushed and killed by an unknown figure. After the Keyblade War, the Dandelions reside in a datascape of Daybreak Town, with all but the Union leaders made to forget what had happened. In the real world, Ephemer meets with Skuld in the Keyblade Graveyard, revealing that they are two of the new Union leaders selected by Ava. They are met by three others: Ventus, Brain, and Strelitzia's older brother, Lauriam. The five agree to keep the world's destruction a secret and form a single Union, Union Cross, to prevent the past from repeating. Meanwhile, Maleficent encounters an unknown figure called Darkness who explains that the world she is in is only a data simulation. Refusing to let her stay due to the damage her knowledge of the future could cause, Darkness guides her to the tower in Daybreak Town, telling her to use the Ark at its center to return to the real world and to her time. Lauriam investigates Strelitzia's disappearance, aided by his fellow party member Elrena, before confronting Maleficent in the tower. Maleficent defeats Lauriam and escapes, but the Ark is damaged during the fight. While unconscious, Lauriam experiences a dream where he finds himself with Strelitzia in a meadow, with the latter suddenly disappearing and reappearing in a white robe and hood. Upon returning to the real world, Darkness instructs Maleficent to use another pod to return to the future. Meanwhile, glitchy afterimages of events from before the Keyblade War begin appearing in Daybreak Town. With the player's help, Brain discovers the glitches are an effect of the datascape being forcibly connected to a data world that was never connected to the original Daybreak Town, and that they are now all trapped in the datascape. While searching the Book of Prophecies for a solution, Brain finds the Master's list and discovers that Ventus is not one of the intended Union leaders, suspecting that Ventus was manipulated into replacing Strelitzia. It turns out Ventus is the one responsible for Strelitzia's demise, having been manipulated by Darkness (who was disguised as Ava) into doing so. Lauriam returns to the tower and gets into a heated fight with the others when he incorrectly assumes they had something to do with Strelitzia‚Äôs death. Things get worse when Ventus reveals that it was he who killed Strelitzia before Darkness emerges from him and reveals itself to the others. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road story Xehanort, living bored on the Destiny Islands, is approached by Ansem, his Heartless from the future, and is shuffled through a portal to Scala Ad Caelum, a world where Keyblade Wielders are trained. Some time later, Xehanort, now a Keyblade Wielder, and his classmates Eraqus, Urd, Bragi, Vor, and Hermod are told by their master Odin that seven upperclassmen have gone missing before their Mark of Mastery exam, with the sister of fellow classmate Baldr among them. While they are far from ready, Odin tasks the youths to find the missing seven by scouring the many worlds. Before they leave, Xehanort and his classmates discuss the state of the worlds: even long after the events of the Keyblade War, many fragments of the World are still forming, and those that have already formed flow on different timeframes ‚Äî while one may be far in the future in terms of technology, another may be still in the beginnings of bearing life or basic technological advancements. With that in mind, and the order not to interfere in the affairs of other worlds, Xehanort and his friends begin their search in Agrabah, splitting into two teams. While they do not find traces of their friends at the end of the day, they remain resolute. The group's next destination is Wonderland, where three members of their party has been captured by the Queen of Hearts for trespassing in her kingdom. They comment on how terrible it is for a ruler to rule through fear and that her subjects are terrified of her, but the Queen counters them, stating that fear is the only way to keep people in line. When a huge Heartless attacks, the Queen runs off, leaving the group to fend for themselves against it and her Card Soldiers. Surviving by the skins of their teeth, they regroup in a nearby forest, ruminating on what happened. They could see that the Queen was possessed by Darkness, but if the Order of the World is that the Queen rules through fear, then they can't change that. It then leads them to fear that the Upper Classmen were executed by the Queen's forces. Xehanort and Eraqus talk in private, wondering if people are oblivious to the darkness inside of them and to other people, like with the Queen and her soldiers. They all fear turning their Keyblades on actual people, but realize that if this trend keeps up in other worlds, they won't have a choice. Xehanort and Eraqus decide to stay and continue their investigation into this world alone while sending everyone else back to Scala Ad Caelum. Four years later, Xehanort, having just put fresh flowers on four gravestones, says his goodbyes to Eraqus, stating he's going off on his own, to see what the master hasn't shown them. While Eraqus hates the idea, he isn't going to stop him, knowing that he'll be back since they need to settle the score for their games. Xehanort then returns to Wonderland to find that the Queen, who had forgotten him, is still possessed by darkness as he awaits his trial. Development Kingdom Hearts œá was co-directed by Tetsuya Nomura, one of the series' creators, and Tatsuya Kando, who had previous directed Nintendo DS game The World Ends with You. The game's music was composed by Yoko Shimomura, a regular contributor to the series' music. The game was co-developed by Square Enix and Japanese studio Success Corporation. Square Enix originally handled the planning and design itself, but due to their developers' inexperience with creating browser games, development was transferred to the Success Corporation, who were familiar with the process. Despite multiplayer elements being included, the game was \\"fundamentally single-player\\", as with most other entries in the series. Translation Chirithy, the player characters' companion, was designed around the concept of a supportive yet unobtrusive guide. Nomura based the character's design on the Scottish Fold domestic cat. Due to difficulties that arose adapting the core Kingdom Hearts experience into a browser game, the presentation was designed in a fairy tale-style instead of the locations encountered previously by series protagonists Sora and Riku. And because the game was to be played with a mouse instead of a game controller, the gameplay focus became simple controls and \\"flashy\\" battles. Translation In an interview, Nomura stated that the work on developing Kingdom Hearts œá was paused for a time so developers could work on Kingdom Hearts III. He also stated that at the time they were exploring ways to allow more fans of the series to experience the game. The stories of Kingdom Hearts œá and Kingdom Hearts III were both written at the same time, and thus share a strong connection. Despite this strong link, it was described by Tetsuya Nomura as a title where story was not the focus, and that its content was completely separate from the main series, making it accessible for newcomers. The game's title refers to the œá-blade (chi-blade), the original Keyblade and a weapon central to the Kingdom Hearts storyline. Translation The creation of a mobile version of the game was decided upon while the browser version was still being developed. Nomura initially planned to release both titles simultaneously, with each being updated individually. However, as development went on, the team's efforts became focused on finishing Kingdom Hearts œá, and development on Unchained was halted. The original plan was to make the game a simpler version of its browser counterpart, but with the increasing specs of mobile devices, the workload increased, contributing to the halt to development. As mobile devices employ a different control set-up to web browsers, Unchained could not work simply as a port of Kingdom Hearts œá. Its title \\"Unchained\\" signified the gameplay and story of Kingdom Hearts œá being released into a mobile format. One of the changes instituted during the games mobile remake was to make the gameplay more \\"casual\\" than Kingdom Hearts œá, with battles being shorter and potentially easier. In March 2017, ahead of the first anniversary of the North American launch of Unchained œá, Square Enix announced that the mobile game would be rebranded as Kingdom Hearts Union œá[Cross] in April 2017. The relaunch of the title would include a new Union Cross multiplayer mode, allowing parties of up to six players to take on the Heartless together through the game's matchmaking feature as they communicate with each other through emotes and text options, and a theater mode to rewatch unlocked cutscenes and animations. In September 2018, a series of special \\"Classic Kingdom\\" minigames was added to Union œá; by completing certain objectives in these minigames, players were able to unlock a special \\"Starlight\\" Keyblade for use in Kingdom Hearts III. In January 2020, a new mobile game called Kingdom Hearts Dark Road was revealed, being developed by the same team working on Union œá. It was later clarified that Dark Road would be a standalone game accessed within Union œá and that the app would be rebranded as Kingdom Hearts Union œá Dark Road upon Dark Roads release. Players would be able to access Dark Road without needing to meet certain criteria within Union œá and would have the ability to link the two games. Release The game was first announced at the Tokyo Game Show on September 20, 2012 alongside Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix under the tentative title Kingdom Hearts for PC Browsers. Its official title was announced in February the following year. To promote the game, codes for special items and in-game currency were included with first-print copies of Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix. A closed beta for the title began on March 22, 2013, with Beta recruitment beginning on March 13. The test was available for users who had a Yahoo Japan ID, and included in-game items and currency as a starting gift. An open beta test began on July 9, 2013, and the game's official service began on July 18 of the same year. Since the original release, the game received constant updates to its story missions, providing additional content to players. In April 2016, Square Enix announced that the browser game would be discontinued in September 2016. Disney Interactive was forced to delay a western localization of the game when the game's publisher Playdom, a social game network owned by Disney, was shut down. Despite this, planning continued for a western release with playtesting taking place to improve upon the game before launch. The western localization was revealed to the public with the title Kingdom Hearts Unchained X at the 2015 Electronic Entertainment Expo. Unchained œá was released in Japan on September 3, 2015, in North America on April 7, 2016, and in Europe on June 16, 2016. Union œá became available on the Amazon Appstore for Amazon devices on January 29, 2019. Kingdom Hearts Dark Road was available worldwide on June 22, 2020. Back Cover In September 2015, Square Enix announced a new game titled Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue. The collection features Kingdom Hearts œá Back Cover, a 60-minute cinematic film that focuses on the Foretellers, elaborating on their actions during the events of the game and their attempts to determine who is the traitor among them. It was released in January 2017. Reception By September 2013, 200,000 users were announced to have enrolled for the game. During the 2013 WebMoney Awards, Kingdom Hearts œá was among the games voted into the \\"Best Rookie of the Year Good Games\\" category, with most voters praising the game for being accessible to series newcomers, and fun to play. Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku was generally positive, saying that despite it being similar to other Japanese browser games and using a micro-transaction system, it was \\"an enjoyable little time waster.\\" Unchained was also well received, with Metacritic giving the game a score of 70 out of 100 based on 5 reviews. AV Club praised the game for being a true Kingdom Hearts title despite its free to play format. TouchArcade gave the game three out of five stars, praising the music and graphics while calling the gameplay shallow with an overcomplicated user interface.

The hostility of the rhetoric from the new leadership of both countries escalated, leading to small scale border fighting, which then in turn escalated into a full blown war in February 1979. North Yemen appeared on the edge of a decisive defeat after a three-front invasion by South Yemeni combined arms formation, however this was prevented by a successful mediation in the form of the Kuwait Agreement of 1979, which resulted in Arab League forces being deployed to patrol the North-South border. An agreement to unite both countries was also signed, although was not implemented. Conflict The Marxist government of South Yemen was alleged to be supplying aid to rebels in the north through the National Democratic Front and crossing the border.Hermann, Richard, Perceptions and behavior in Soviet foreign policy, University of Pittsburgh Pre, 1985, page 152 On 24 February, forces from North and South Yemen began firing at each other across the border. Force from North Yemen, led by some radical army officers, crossed the border into South Yemen and attacked a number of villages. The PDRY, with support from the Soviet Union, Cuba, and East Germany, responded by invading the north using 3 regular divisions and a Tactical Air Force regiment. The PDRY was also supported by the NDF, who were in the midst of fighting their own rebellion against the government of North Yemen. Within 3 days of the invasion, the numerically smaller South Yemeni forces had established complete air superiority over the theater, thus forcing the North Yemeni Ground Forces on the back foot for the rest of the War. The South Yemeni attack carried the advantage of surprise and was spearheaded by the an Artillery barrage and groups of Sappers, who were effectively able to blow up the early warning air defences and radars and thus help the Air Force establish air superiority within days over much of Taizz and Dhale Governorates and parts of Al Bayda Governorate, after getting the better off the weak resistance put up by a North Yemeni Air Force squadron in a dogfight that saw most of the North Yemeni planes being downed. After the initial Air Force attack, a South Yemeni Armoured Division composed of T-55 and T-62 Tanks spearheaded the ground assault on a Yemeni Armoured Division stationed near Taizz city, followed by an Infantry Division covered by an Artillery Brigade providing fire support with BM-21 Grad rockets and M-46 field howitzers. This was soon followed by the South Yemeni Air Force further destroying several North Yemeni MiG-21 fighter jets and helicopters on the ground in airfields and airbases in Dhamar, thus preventing any chance of a Northern aerial counter-attack. The war dragged on for nearly a month, with North Yemen being unable to send reinforcement units from Sana'a down to Taizz due to the constant Southern airstrikes and aggressive air patrolling hitting reinforcement convoys on difficult and winding mountain roads as far north as Dhamar. Although Northern forces vastly outnumbered Southern forces overall, they were outnumbered and overwhelmed within the theater of operations in and around Taizz and Dhale, since a single Division had to face an attack from three enemy Divisions without any reinforcement or close air support due to the Southern air patrolling and airstrikes on Northern roads throughout the month. On 8 March, the South Yemeni Air Force managed to carry out an attack on Sana'a City, with 3 Su-22 bombers with 5 MiG-21 fighters flying top cover, dropping 500-pound bombs on a Mechanized Infantry base and strafing the Judges' Court and Central Prison, causing mass panic among civilians. North Yemeni Air Defences operating the SA-3 engaged and managed to shoot down one of the bombers and one MiG-21, capturing the pilots. Another deep raid on 10th March saw 4 South Yemeni MiG-21s strafe an Airbase and the Sea port near Hodeidah, sinking a civilian Egyptian cargo ship, but being met with sudden interception from a squadron of North Yemeni MiG-21s with the result that one of the South Yemeni MiGs were shot down and crashed into the Sea, killing the Pilot. With losses escalating, Northern forces appearing on the verge of exhaustion, and Southern forces capturing a wide range of Northern territory and besieging the cities of Taizz and Al Bayda within two weeks, and a South Yemeni Infantry Brigade maanging to capture some suburbs of Taizz, Saudi Arabia and the United States rushed arms to bolster the government of North Yemen by 9-10 March. Citing the alleged Soviet-backed PDRY aggression against the YAR, and the threat this could pose to U.S. ally Saudi Arabia, the United States greatly stepped up military assistance to the YAR government. As part of this the U.S. shipped 18 F-5E planes to the YAR in order to strengthen the government. However, there were no YAR pilots trained in flying the F-5E, and as a result the U.S. and Saudi Arabia arranged to have 80 Taiwanese pilots plus ground crew and Iraqi anti-air defense units sent to North Yemen. A U.S. Navy task force was also sent to the Arabian Sea in response to the escalating violence. The War showed the weakness and lacunae in the North Yemeni Military training and equipment, and soon its allies started an aggressive re-armament and training programme for the YAR Army to enable it to regain strategic balance and parity against superior trained PDRY forces. The North Yemen allies, led by Egypt, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, soon provided much military aid, equipment and training in order to plug the shortage caused due to the losses in the War, and by 1983-84, the North had regained its strength Hoagland, Edward, Balancing Acts,Globe Pequot, 1999, page 218Interview with Al-Hamdani Middle East Research and Information Reports, February 1985 Aftermath Kuwait Agreement of 1979 On 20 March the leaders of North and South Yemen called a bilateral ceasefire met in Kuwait for a reconciliation summit, in part at the strong insistence of Iraq. The talks were mediated by the Arab League. Under the Kuwait Agreement, both parties reaffirmed their commitment to the goal and process of Yemeni Unification, as had been spelled out in the Cairo Agreement of 1972. This agreement to unify was particularly the result of pressure from Iraq, Syria, and Kuwait, all of whom advocated for a unified Arab world in order to best respond to the issues arising from the Camp David accords, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the Iranian Revolution. POWs were exchanged within the next two months, and work for a draft constitution for a united Yemen proceeded over the next two years, however most attempts to implement the spirit and letter of the agreement were put on hold until 1982, and the end of the rebellion by the South Yemen supported National Democratic Front.

Johnson (August 30, 1927 ‚Äì April 15, 2017) was a member of the famed group of African-American World War II pilots known as the Tuskegee Airmen. During World War II, he served as the chief mechanic servicing the fighter planes of the 99th Fighter Squadron of the 477th Composite Group. Biography Early life Buford A. Johnson was born in Longview, Texas on August 30, 1927. He was raised in Shiloh, Texas, graduating from the Shiloh High School in 1945. Military career An Air Force cadet speaks with Tuskegee Airman Buford Johnson during the 40th Tuskegee Airmen national convention at Gaylord National Hotel in National Harbor, Md., Aug. 6, 2011. Defense.gov photo essay 110806-F-RH756-151 When Johnson was 18 years old, the U.S. Military drafted him into the U.S. Navy. At the time, the only tasks that African-American men were allowed to do in the Navy were menial jobs, which he was not interested in doing. He learned that volunteering for a three-year tour of duty in the U.S. Army would supersede the draft orders, so Johnson instead enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Force in 1945. He became one of the first African-Americans allowed to work on U.S. fighter aircraft. Johnson did his Basic Training at Sheppard Field Texas. Upon graduating, he was assigned to the 99th Fighter Squadron of the 477th Composite Group which was stationed at Godman Field, Kentucky. After World War II, Johnson was stationed at Lockbourne AFB in Ohio and from there was transferred to Itazuke Air Base in Japan. At Itaszuke, his orders were to support a P-51 Fighter Squadron; his abilities earned him the honor of being a mechanic on the 80th Fighter Bomber Squadron's first F-80C aircraft. He became the first African-American to be a jet mechanic in the United States Air Force, a Crew Chief to work on jet aircraft, and a Crew Chief working on jet aircraft in a combat zone. Johnson was transferred out of the Korean War zone on 19 December 1951 and was assigned a month later to the 6520th Test Support Wing, Air Force Cambridge Research Center, on the Hanscom AFB in Bedford, Massachusetts as an Aircraft Maintenance Supervisor in January 1952. He was promoted from Technical Sergeant to Master Sergeant on 1 April 1953. On 25 July 1956, Johnson received orders to transfer to the 50th Fighter-Bomber Wing in Toul-Rosieres Air Base in France, where he reported three weeks later on 15 August 1956. He was assigned to the 417th Fighter Group. On 29 July 1960, Johnson was transferred to the Air Force Test Center at Edwards Air Force Base, California. During his time working with the 417th Tactical Fighter Squadron at Edwards Air Force Base, Buford received the Air Force Commendation Medal for Meritorious Service on 21 December 1962. He remained at Edwards Air Force Base until July 1965, at which point he received orders to transfer to Oxnard Air Force Base, California to take up the duties of Non-Commissioned Officer in Charge of Maintenance Control. Johnson retired in 1966. Death Master Sergeant Buford A. Johnson died on April 15, 2017.
