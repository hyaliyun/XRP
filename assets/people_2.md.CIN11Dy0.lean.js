Born in New York, she earned a BA at Radcliffe College, then graduated from Newnham College, Cambridge, and later studied at New York and Columbia Universities in New York. Goell travelled to the Middle East in the 1930s, working with archaeologists in Jerusalem and Gerasa, before returning to New York. She returned to the Middle East after the Second World War, and in 1947 visited Nemrud Dagh for the first time; excavations there would become her life's work. Goell was involved in excavations at a number of other Middle Eastern sites over the course of her career, including at Tarsus and Samosata. Goell's work in Turkey \\"nearly single-handedly opened up ancient Commagene to the world\\". Early life and education Newnham College, Cambridge Theresa Goell was born in New York, on 17 July 1901. Her parents, Jacob and Mary Samowitz Goell, were middle-class Jews who had emigrated to the US from Russia. Goell was the second of three children; her sister, Eva, would with her husband Philip Godfrey financially support Goell's career, while her brother, Kermit, would go on to work on digs with her. Goell was raised in Brooklyn and studied at Erasmus High School; after graduation, she studied for two years at Syracuse University before moving to Radcliffe College, where she earned a B.A., majoring in philosophy and social ethics. While at Radcliffe, Goell met and married Cyrus Levinthal. Levinthal was the brother of the Goell family's rabbi and the match had been encouraged by Goell's father. While still studying at Radcliffe, Goell had a son, Jay. Also during her studies she began to lose her hearing due to otosclerosis and learned to lip-read in compensation. In 1926, Goell and her husband both moved to England and enrolled at Cambridge University; Goell studied art history, architecture, and archaeology at Newnham College, and achieved the equivalent of a B.A. in architecture (it was not until 1948 that women were permitted to become full members of the university and be granted degrees). Early work By 1932, Goell and Levinthal had divorced. In the spring of 1933, Goell went to Jerusalem and began to work for the American Schools of Oriental Research (ASOR), drawing pottery for William F. Albright and Aage Schmidt, and doing general drawing for William Stinespring. She continued to work under ASOR in Jerusalem in 1934, taking on more work from the expedition at Gerasa, including working on the reconstruction of finds from the dig. Goell's work in Palestine also included contemporary architecture, and she was involved in the design of more than 200 buildings in cities such as Tel Aviv, Haifa and Jerusalem. Goell's designs featured modernist styles resembling mansions in Brooklyn. In 1935, Goell returned to New York, and began to study at the New York University School of Fine and Applied Arts, believing that improving her drawing skills was necessary for her continued career in archaeology. For two years she was unable to obtain any further work in the field, and worked as an architectural and window display designer for a department store in New York and New Jersey. In 1938 she enrolled at the Institute of Fine Arts in New York University, studying for a master's degree with as her advisor. Her thesis was to be on the relationship between Palmyrene sculpture and the sculpture of the Roman near east. It was while studying there that Lehmann first suggested to Goell that she should explore Nemrud Dagh, the excavations of which were to become her life's work. Goell continued to study at the Institute for Fine Arts and at Columbia until 1945. During the Second World War, she also worked to contribute to the American war effort, working as a draftswoman for various engineering firms under contract to the US Navy, which interrupted her studies. Nemrud Dagh Nemrud Dagh, the site that became Goell's life's work After the war, Goell travelled to Tarsus in southern Turkey, having been invited by Hetty Goldman; she spent the next few months working on the excavations there. She continued to work on the excavations at Tarsus until 1953, and due to Goldman's illness, ended up supervising the dig and overseeing the writing up of the results. In the summer of 1947, when the excavations at Tarsus broke for the summer, Goell visited Nemrud Dagh for the first time. She described the state of the site on her first visit as \\"a complete shambles\\". In 1951, Goell returned to Nemrud Dagh, and began to arrange for an expedition there, hoping to be able to find and excavate the tomb of Antiochus I of Commagene. She discovered that Friedrich Karl D√∂rner was also planning an expedition there, and agreed to collaborate with him. In 1952, she began to raise funds and organise a team for an expedition; the American Philosophical Society agreed to sponsor the dig, and the Bollingen Foundation made a grant of $2,000. D√∂rner and Goell agreed that she would lead the excavation at the top of Nemrud Dagh, with his assistance as an epigrapher; D√∂rner would excavate the settlement of Arsameia-on-the-Nymphaios at the foot of the mountain, and Goell would assist. 1954 was the first full season of Goell's excavations at Nemrud Dagh. Though the excavations were planned to conclude in 1955, a $10,000 grant from the Bollingen Foundation, and the prospect of more work to be done, persuaded Goell to plan a 1956 season at the site. After a year away from the site, Goell returned and excavations resumed in 1958, though the work was hampered by the poor weather. Goell's excavations uncovered the colossal stone heads for which Nemrud Dagh is now famed. Head of Antiochus I of Commagene from Nemrud Dagh. Goell never discovered the tomb of Antiochus that she hoped to find at Nemrud Dagh. In July 1960, Goell delivered a paper on the excavations at Nemrud Dagh to the Congress for Orientalists in Moscow, and the following year, a survey of her work was published in the National Geographic. She went on to lecture on her work at the University of London, and was elected a corresponding member of the German Archaeological Institute in Berlin. Goell returned to Nemrud Dagh in 1963 and began two years of geophysical probing of the site, hoping to find the tomb of Antiochus I of Commagene; these attempts were unsuccessful. Goell's work at Nemrud Dagh shed new light on religious trends during the reign of Antiochus I (70 BC - 38 BC). At this period, the region's culture was affected by various traditions including Babylonian, Hellenistic and Anatolian cultures. Goell's excavations documented the influence of \\"salvation\\" mystery cults during this transitional period between paganism and Christianity. Samosata In 1964, Goell turned her attention to the ancient city of Samosata, directing an investigation into the stratigraphy of the mound at the site, with 40 meters of archaeological deposits from thousands of years of occupation of the site; this was to be the first of three seasons she spent there. In 1965, she narrated a film about Nemrud Dagh for the National Geographical Society, and spent much of the rest of the year trying to finish the Nemrud Dagh expedition report. She remained in New York in 1966, working on material from Samosata as well as the Nemrud Dagh expedition report. In 1968, though William Albright encouraged Goell to publish the first volume of the Nemrud Dagh report, she did not, feeling that the contributions from D√∂rner and John Young (who was working on the sculpture from the site) were incomplete. In the same year, she traveled to Iran to work on comparative material for the Samosata excavations and to visit Persepolis. Later life In February 1970, Goell was told that ASOR had set a one-year time limit for completing the Nemrud Dagh publication. Goell spent much of the next five years working on the manuscript of the report, though little progress was made. She did, however, manage to arrange with the Turkish Department of Antiquities for restoration works at Nemrud Dagh to begin. In 1973, Goell visited Nemrud Dagh for the final time. In 1976, Goell's legs became paralysed while she was in Germany; she was found to have a tumour on her spine which required immediate surgery. She recovered first in the hospital in M√ºnster, and then at her sister's house in Florida, before returning to New York. There, she prepared a report on the excavations at Samosata for the National Geographical Society, and planned new expeditions to Nemrud Dagh. In April 1978, doctors pronounced Goell well enough to return to Turkey, where she spent the second half of the year working. Goell continued to work on the report on the excavations at Nemrud Dagh until she had a stroke in 1983. She did not complete the report in her lifetime, nor did she discover the tomb of King Antiochus. She died in New York City on 18 December 1985, after a long period of illness. Her papers were given to Harvard University by her brother Kermit, and are housed there in the Schlesinger Library and Semitic Museum. In 1990, Goell was posthumously awarded a master's degree in recognition of her work on Commagenian history. A documentary about Goell's life, Queen of the Mountain, was produced in 2006.

It is north of the Canadian Pacific Railway tracks and Dupont Avenue and south of Davenport Road and the ridge that is the former Lake Iroquois coastline. Its eastern boundary is Bathurst Street and it stretches west to Lansdowne Avenue. It is contained within the larger city-recognized neighbourhood of Corso Italia-Davenport. The neighbourhood lends its name to federal, provincial and municipal ridings that cover it and a number of neighbouring areas. History Davenport from Dovercourt Road, south of Geary Avenue (c. 1912). During this period, the area was primarily made up of small plants and factories along the railway tracks. Davenport Road follows a centuries old carrying trail the First Nations peoples used to travel the route south of the ridge. It was also an important route by the early European settlers to the region and the area that is today Davenport became home to small farms in the early nineteenth century. One of the first settlers was Ensign John McGill, who built a home he named Davenport in 1797. This was named after Major Davenport, another local officer, and is the origin of the area's name (the name Davenport is of Norman French origin: Dauen-port meaning \\"the town on the trickling stream\\"). In 1861 the Northern Railway ran a rail line to the south of Davenport Rd and built a station in the area which they named Davenport. A small village, also named Davenport, grew up around the station. In 1889 the village merged with the nearby Carleton Village and West Toronto Junction to form the town of Toronto Junction. In 1909 this was annexed to the city of Toronto itself. Like the rest of the area known as The Junction in the early twentieth century the presence of the railway led to the industrialization of the area and many small plants and factories were set up in the area along the tracks. The residential areas to the north became home to the working class population that worked there, especially Italian Canadians, who dominated the neighbourhood and the nearby Corso Italia by the 1950s. It today remains home to many Italian and Portuguese residents, but since the departure of most of the factories in the 1970s and 1980s the area has been somewhat gentrified taking on some of the characteristics of nearby areas like the Annex. New townhouse developments have been built in the area replacing former factories and warehouses. Today, the neighborhood is largely Portuguese with sizable Italian, Latin American, British, and Chinese populations.

Introduced to the show in 2005, the family derives from Manchester and moved to Hollyoaks village in 2005. The characters have been involved in storylines such as secret siblings, anorexia, drug abuse, incest and paternity issues. With Phoebe McQueen, the deceased Rhys Ashworth's adoptive daughter\`s recent murder in June 2015, there are officially no longer any Ashworth family members left in Hollyoaks, besides Darren Osborne, who between 2009 until 2011 was married to Hannah Ashworth; though, their marriage ended in divorce. History The Ashworth family first arrived in 2005, introduced by producer David Hanson. They moved to Hollyoaks village from Manchester with family friend, Gilly Roach (Anthony Quinlan). Nev (Jim Millea) and Suzanne (Suzanne Hall) had fallen in love at a young age and married, however, in 1986, Suzanne fell for Nev's younger brother Noel's (Craig Cheetham) charms and the pair slept together. After this, she gave birth to her first child, Rhys (Andrew Moss). Nev forgave Suzanne and Noel and they decided that Nev would raise the child as his own. In 1988, Noel had an illegitimate daughter, named Beth (Sin√©ad Moynihan), to a woman named Mary. Noel visited rarely but did stay in contact with his daughter. In 1989, Suzanne became pregnant again, this time it was Nev's, they had a girl named Hannah (Emma Rigby). In 1991, Nev and Suzanne had Josh (Sonny Flood), their final child together. At a young age, Rhys fell into a river and almost drowned, however was saved by Gilly. The pair became best friends and Gilly became one of the family. Also close to the family was Jamie \\"Fletch\\" Fletcher (Sam Darbyshire), cousin of Rhys, Hannah and Josh, who was also his best friend. Although it was never fully established how Fletch relates to Nev or Suzanne, it is most likely one of his parents is Suzanne's sibling, given her maiden name of Fletcher. In 2008, Emma Rigby, who plays Hannah, decided to leave Hollyoaks. Following this news, it was revealed that Rigby had extended her contract. Rigby again extended her contract, and left the series onscreen in January 2010. Later in 2010, new producer Paul Marquess axed the family, except Andrew Moss (Rhys), as part of his overhaul of the series. Neville, Suzanne, and Josh left for Spain in July 2010. Rigby expressed her feelings towards the family's exit, saying: \\"I'm sad it's coming to an end. I think they were quite emotional when they left. I don't think they were quite ready to go. But I suppose they'll all be doing new things.\\" In Hollyoaks A frequent visitor, Bill Ashworth is the father of Nev who adored Hannah, yet was not liked by Josh. However, Josh and Fletch began to see Bill was lonely, and ended up sneaking him out of his care home. Josh and Amy Barnes formed a band called the 'Baby Diegos' with Michaela, Sasha and Fletch. Josh made enemies of Ste Hay and Wayne Tunnicliffe. Hannah and Nancy Hayton babysat Grace Hutchinson for Tony and Mandy Hutchinson, that night, Grace died of SIDS, leaving Hannah and Nancy feeling shocked and guilt-ridden, believing it was their fault. After this, Hannah began a relationship with uneasy John Paul McQueen. After a night of joyriding, Suzanne gave Amy a check-up and discovered she was pregnant. She then warned Josh to stay away when the pair began a relationship. After the birth of her child Leah, Amy covered up and told Josh that Leah was her sister, born to Mike and Kathy Barnes. Mike became increasingly involved in Josh and Amy's relationship, this ended up with Josh nearly killing him by hitting him over the head with a brick. Josh was arrested, however Mike dropped the charges. After discovering Leah was really her daughter, Josh split up with Amy and told her he could not trust her. When Sarah became a model and John Paul came out as gay, Hannah turned to Sarah's model friend Melissa Hurst for help and advice. Melissa taught self-conscious Hannah how to be skinny by hiding food and making herself sick. Soon, Hannah began an eating disorder and shut her friends out of her life. Sarah and Nancy assumed Hannah was on drugs. Suzanne then found rotting food in a sideboard in her bedroom and discovered the truth. Hannah was sectioned, both her and Melissa were put in hospital. Melissa escaped and planned to flee Hollyoaks with Hannah, however, tragedy struck when Melissa took a heart attack and died. Hannah was heartbroken by her friend's death but agreed to get help in hospital. Rhys met Beth Clement when he accidentally ran her over, the pair soon began a relationship, however, not wanting to jinx it, Rhys did not introduce her to his family straight away. Beth stopped seeing Rhys, who was deeply saddened. Neville told Rhys that Noel had died of liver disease. At his funeral, Rhys was introduced to his secret half-sister, who turned out to be Beth. Rhys and Beth agreed to keep quiet about their affair, knowing it was incest. Gilly took an instant liking to Beth and they soon started going out. After months of holding back their feelings, Rhys and Beth slept together, realising they were in love. Beth felt guilty for cheating on Gilly so the pair left to go travelling to Thailand, which angered Rhys. After their return, Gilly proposed to Beth, who shockingly agreed. However, behind Gilly's back, Beth and Rhys began an affair. Meanwhile, recovering Hannah had found love in Danny Valentine, much to racist Nev's dislike. Michaela McQueen caught Rhys and Beth kissing and tried to tell Mercedes, who was Rhys's girlfriend. She refused to believe her, however Michaela got Gilly to return home in the hope he would find them in bed. Gilly did so and caught them in the act. After the secret was out, Rhys and Beth decided to flee together to escape the police. On their departure, Rhys and Beth crashed their camper van into a lorry which immediately killed Beth. Heartbroken Rhys then left for a short time. Hannah and Danny's relationship ended thanks to Darren Osborne and Mercedes With he and Amy's relationship over and Fletch's addiction to drugs getting out of hand, Josh enlisted Rhys and Gilly to join the 'Baby Diegos', with a name change to 'Dirty Diegos'. Soon, the band broke up and Josh returned to the original line-up, he then attempted to get a record deal, but chose pregnant Amy, as the pair had reconciled, over his dream. Nev bought a few flats in Hollyoaks and then proceeded to buy The Dog on the Pond from Jack and Frankie Osborne. The pub was silent so Nev renamed it The Jolly Roger, this was quickly reverted on realising it had turned into a gay bar. Hannah met Matt Bowman, whom she began to see, however they soon split up. Josh and Amy split up after she gave birth to Lucas Hay and she abandoned him. Hannah began a relationship with Ash Roy, who became jealous of Hannah's friendship with Justin Burton. Hannah began to realise her feelings for Justin. Ash and Justin challenged each other to a bike race. Ash fiddled with Justin's bike on order to hurt him, however, Hannah got on the bike and was badly injured. After finding out what he did, Hannah ended her relationship with Ash and, with the help of McFly, began seeing Justin. The Asworths were convinced Justin was a bad influence on Hannah. Ash seen an opportunity for revenge and planted food in Hannah's bedroom, which Suzanne found. The Ashworths went to extreme lengths to stop Hannah and Justin's relationship as they believed it was the cause of her \\"relapse\\". Hannah planned to leave Hollyoaks with Justin, however she was stopped by Rhys. Eager to leave, Hannah told Rhys that she could not choose who she fell in love with, just like him and Beth. Rhys realised this and let her leave. Hannah went to The Loft to find Justin and was knocked unconscious by Clare Cunningham, who had tied up Warren Fox and planned to kill Justin. Hannah came around as The Loft began to burn, she attacked Clare and the two fell over the banister, where they both lay motionless. Luckily, Justin appeared and saved Hannah, as paramedics struggled with her life, Justin assumed she was dead and left after being accused of starting the fire. With the police after him, Justin convinced Hannah to run away with him, however he realised it would mean she could never see her family again and left her. Hannah was heartbroken and angry over Justin's departure. Rhys went on a date with Hayley Ramsey, but was put off by her wheelchair. The pair began a love-hate relationship in which Rhys denied liking her. The pair were thrown together in Josh's new band, 'The Somethings' and finally the pair gave in and shared a kiss and began going out. Trying to cope with Justin's exit, Hannah began to drink and spent many nights in the SUBar. She ended the night drunkenly kissing Gilly, which she regretted as they see each other as siblings. Hannah met a man named Stav, who was playing at the SUBar with his band. After, Hannah joined him in a trip to Denmark, where she drunkenly married Darren Osborne. On her return, the couple tried to keep it a secret but were found out. Suzanne tried to get Hannah to get the marriage annulled, however Hannah did not want to be a divorcee at her age and agreed to try to make the marriage work.

In January 2011, it was announced that Thomson had quit the series and would make her on-screen departure later in the year.http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/news/a301055/kim-thomson- to-leave-emmerdale.html Creation and development=Casting= The character was first introduced to Emmerdale by then-series producer Gavin Blyth in March 2009, played by Kim Thomson. The character was introduced as a 'mysterious' acquaintance of Mark Wylde, and as his story progressed, it later transpired that Faye had been married to Mark (who at the time of the marriage was known as Daniel Lamb). In July 2009, Faye moved into the village with her son Ryan who was earlier revealed as Mark's son. =Departure= In January 2011, Thomson announced that she would be leaving Emmerdale. Speaking of her decision to bow out, Thomson said \\"I'm sad of course because I've loved working with everyone here, but I found it so hard being away from home. It's just too far from London. I've got friends I literally haven't seen for two years because I get home at weekends and there's only a 24-hour window to fit everyone in. That's been hard, but I've had an amazing time here and been so lucky with storylines - I'll be sad to go.\\" Of her on-screen exit, Thomson continued \\"I can't say anything about how I leave because the producers want to keep that under wraps for now. I'm sure, as with most Emmerdale exits, it will be dramatic.\\" Asked what she will miss most about Emmerdale, Thomson stated \\"I think, as with everything, you miss the people. They're a lovely crowd, great crew and actors and it's been a pleasure working with them. It's also been great fun to do something where it's all a bit heightened and you get to go around slapping other women - and there was a lot of slapping. I've enjoyed being the slappee and the slapper!\\" Storylines Faye is first spotted by Mark pulling out of Home Farm and he is worried that she is responsible for his son Will's disappearance. However, Will was discovered camping in the grounds of Home Farm. The following week, she applies for a marketing job at Home Farm, impressing Natasha Wylde, who offers her the job. The following night, Mark goes to visit but discovers that she has left. Faye rings Natasha, declining the job and worries Mark again when she takes a picture of the Wylde family from Home Farm, smashing a vase in the process. Panicked, Mark warns her to stay away. Mark and Faye meet in the woods and he gives her an expensive flat, hoping she will leave him alone. In May 2009, Faye returns, asking about the job and learns that Mark and Natasha are renewing their wedding vows. Faye confronts Mark, revealing that his real name is Daniel Lamb and he is, in fact, married to her, making his marriage to Natasha bigamous. Daniel had disappeared 27 years earlier after his company collapsed, leaving them in serious debt. He moved to France and later set up a new, stolen identity, Mark Wylde. Mark tells Faye that he did love her. The next day, Faye attends the vow renewal ceremony, telling Mark that she only kept the truth about him to herself because she did not want to hurt Natasha or his children. Faye continues to text Mark and they meet again in June 2009. She introduces him to their son, Ryan, who has recently moved in with her and has no idea that Mark is his father. In late June, Natasha discovers that Mark has bought a flat and, on investigating, finds Faye. Faye tells her about Mark's past. Natasha is stunned but convinced when Mark admits it and realises that Faye wants her husband back. Despite her anger and disgust, she stays with Mark, making him promise to keep this from their children. She then threatens Faye that she will tell Ryan that she has been lying about his father unless Faye stays away from them. When Faye continues to contact Mark, Natasha offers her a large financial settlement to leave or face being reported for insurance fraud. Faye demands ¬£50,000 more than the original offer and on receiving it, she and Ryan vacate the flat. However, in July, they rent a cottage in Emmerdale. Faye takes a job as PA at Sharma and Sharma, the new sweet factory in the village, and has a brief relationship with Cain Dingle. This ends, however, when Cain realises that Faye is using him to make Mark jealous. Mark realises that he still has feelings for Faye and tells her that he wants her back. She agrees, on condition that he leaves Natasha and tells him that she is not prepared to be his bit on the side. They plan to run away together but realising the pain they will cause, change their minds and share a goodbye kiss, which Natasha witnesses. The three of them have a row, during which Ryan comes downstairs with Mark and Natasha's daughter Maisie and announce that they are dating. Natasha tells them that they cannot date each other because they are half-brother and sister, devastating Ryan and Maisie. Ryan is angry with Mark and Faye for lying to him and moves in with ex- girlfriend, Katie Sugden, until he can organise somewhere else. Later, Faye's house is broken into and ransacked by Mark and Natasha's son Nathan. Faye returns home and Nathan attacks her, pinning her down. Shortly afterwards Ryan returns home and pulls Nathan off his mother and throws him out. Ryan soon moves into Dale View with Andy Sugden. Faye later embarks on a relationship with her boss, Jai Sharma. In July 2010, Nathan and Natasha plot to frame Faye for Mark's murder, but when Mark's body is discovered, Natasha discovers that Nathan has framed Ryan instead of Faye. Subsequently, Ryan is arrested and charged with Mark's murder. Jai and Faye split up due to the pressure of Ryan's imprisonment. In September, Faye, still adamant that her son is innocent, forms an alliance with Natasha's business partner and former boyfriend Declan Macey to try to bring down the Wyldes. This begins with Faye contesting Mark's will. In October, Ryan is found guilty of Mark's murder but Faye remains convinced of his innocence and becomes increasingly frustrated with Cain, Ryan's boss, who believes Nathan is guilty but will not go to the police for fear of incriminating himself, having previously blackmailed Nathan and Natasha. Cain kidnaps Nathan and after alerting Maisie, she forces Nathan to confess that it was Natasha who killed Mark. Natasha confirms that Nathan is telling the truth and is arrested. Faye goes to court to witness Natasha's sentencing, angering Nathan. Natasha is sentenced to life imprisonment and ordered to serve a minimum term of 21 years before being considered for parole. Faye remarks smugly to Nathan that it was worth waiting for. Faye develops a strong dislike of Charity Tate, Cain's girlfriend and second cousin, after she begins working for Jai as a new property developer. Faye enjoys goading Charity and informs Cain of Jai and Charity's flirting. Cain, mistakenly believing that Charity and Jai are sleeping together, seduces Faye, and they sleep together. They kiss each other in the street as Cain leaves Faye's house the following morning. Charity witnesses this and furiously slaps Faye. Faye is fired from her job by Jai after slapping him, after he goads and insults her over her jealousy of Charity, and threatens to sue the firm for unfair dismissal. Jai's brother Nikhil, worried about the bad reputation the company might earn if Faye's lawsuit is successful, decides to settle Faye out of court, and offers her a ¬£10,000 settlement which she accepts. After this, Faye tells Ryan that she intends to leave the village for a fresh start. She tells him that she is moving to San Francisco as she has friends there and offers Ryan the chance to come with her but he refuses, telling her that his future is in the village. Ryan helps Faye pack up her house. She leaves the following day and tearfully bids Ryan farewell, telling him that she will miss him. Katie also comes to see her off and Faye tells her that she will be one of the people she will miss. Cain also briefly bids farewell to her as he walks past. Faye then gets into her taxi and is driven out of the village as Ryan and Katie wave her off.

(February 20, 1943 - July 18, 2009) was one of the first to identify a pattern of illnesses that was ultimately diagnosed as AIDS during his work as a general practitioner in the United States. He later became an advocate for the development of treatments and prevention of the disease.  Early life and education  Weisman was born in Newark, New Jersey, on February 20, 1943. He attended the Kansas City College of Osteopathy (later known as the Kansas City University of Medicine and Biosciences, graduating in 1970 with a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO). He practiced medicine in his hometown of Carteret, New Jersey, for several years and ended his brief marriage by disclosing that he was gay.Colvin, Richard. \\"Merciful M. D.

Weisman dies at 66; among the first doctors to detect AIDS\\", Los Angeles Times, July 23, 2009. Accessed July 24, 2009.  Discovery and treatment of AIDS  He moved to Los Angeles and was hired by a doctor's office in North Hollywood, where he started to see a number of patients in 1978 who had a series of unusual conditions, including younger men with shingles, a case of Kaposi's sarcoma, and several patients who had symptoms of what appeared to be, but was not, lymphoma. In 1980, a series of patients came to a medical office he had opened in Sherman Oaks, all gay men who had a pattern of what appeared to be immune system disorders exhibited by significant loss of weight and swollen lymph nodes, accompanied by fever and rashes, in addition to two patients with chronic diarrhea, depressed white blood cell counts and fungal infections. Weisman referred two of these cases in 1981 to Michael S. Gottlieb, an immunologist at the UCLA Medical Center, who had a patient of his own with a similar pattern of symptoms. Weisman recollected that he knew going into this meeting that these cases \\"represented was the tip of the iceberg\\" and that there were \\"a lot of people that were potentially right behind them\\". Gottlieb diagnosed these and a number of his other patients as having pneumocystis pneumonia. A report they jointly wrote published by the Centers for Disease Control in the June 5, 1981, issue of its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, describing how their patients, \\"5 young men, all active homosexuals, were treated for biopsy-confirmed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia at 3 different hospitals in Los Angeles, California\\" of which \\"[t]wo of the patients died\\" by the time of the original report.Staff. \\"Pneumocystis Pneumonia ‚Äî Los Angeles\\", Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, August 30, 1996 / Vol. 45 / No. 34.

Weisman immediately started warning his patients that the disease was sexually transmitted and that behavioral changes were needed to help prevent its spread, a warning that was often disregarded and resulted in the deaths of many friends. He became involved in efforts to provide treatment options for AIDS patients, establishing AIDS Project Los Angeles in 1983 and developing Southern California's first AIDS unit at the Sherman Oaks Hospital. When amfAR was founded in 1985 by Gottlieb and Mathilde Krim, Weisman was a board member and became chairman from 1988 to 1992. His medical practice grew into the Pacific Oaks Medical Group, one of the largest treating patients with HIV / AIDS. In Weisman's obituary in the Los Angeles Times, Gottlieb described him as \\"a very astute physician\\" who recognized \\"that something out of the ordinary was happening\\" by being \\"alert to unusual symptoms in his patients\\". Krim described how Weisman immediately knew that \\"he was observing something that was never seen before.\\"  Personal  Weisman died at age 66 due to heart disease on July 18, 2009, at his home in the Westwood neighborhood of Los Angeles. He was survived by his domestic partner of 17 years, Bill Hutton, as well as by a daughter and granddaughter, a brother and two nieces. Timothy Bogue, his partner for 10 years, died of AIDS in 1991.

It is structurally similar to MDA, but without the methyl group at the alpha position. According to Alexander Shulgin in his book PiHKAL, MDPEA appears to be biologically inactive. This is likely because of extensive first-pass metabolism by the enzyme monoamine oxidase. However, if MDPEA were either used in high enough of doses (e.g., 1-2 grams), or in combination with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), it is probable that it would become sufficiently active, though it would likely have a relatively short duration of action.

It is dedicated to the Archangel Michael.  History  For centuries, the Heiligenstadt parish was an important parish in the area that now forms the district of D√∂bling. The church is mentioned for the first time in 1243 as a subsidiary of the Klosterneuburg Monastery; it was elevated to the status of a parish church in the 14th century. The parish covered not just Heiligenstadt, but also the surrounding villages of Nu√üdorf, Grinzing, Sievering, Salmannsdorf, Neustift am Walde, Oberd√∂bling and Unterd√∂bling. The parish priests were provided by the Klosterneuburg Monastery; even today, many of the district‚Äôs parishes are supervised by individuals belonging to the Monastery. As the Heiligenstadt parish was responsible for such a large number of believers, a relatively large church was built in the village. Over time however, the surrounding settlements all became independent parishes, which resulted in a gradual loss of importance for Heiligenstadt. The creation of the Sievering parish in 1348 robbed the Heiligenstadt parish of large sections of its former territory, as both Salmannsdorf and Neustift am Walde were included in the new parish. D√∂bling, which later became part of the W√§hring parish, was also made independent. The neighbouring villages of Nu√üdorf and Grinzing remained a part of the Heiligenstadt parish until Joseph II‚Äôs parish reform. It was necessary to repair the Gothic building following the Ottoman invasions; in 1723, it was rebuilt in Baroque style. By the end of the 19th century however, the building was in such a state of disrepair that everything but the choir and the lower walls had to be torn down. The new construction, which resembled the old church in all aspects except the spire, was designed by Richard Jordan, who was also responsible for the nearby D√∂bling Carmelite Nunnery. Josef and Martin Sch√∂mer were also involved in the construction of the new parish church.  Structure  The Heiligenstadt Parish Church is a Gothic revival church with multiple naves. The altar, which is also the work of the architects responsible for the reconstruction of the church, shows in the centre the Archangel Michael, after whom the parish is named. The secondary altar, which was also produced by the same architects, is a Gothic revival work showing Mary. Only this secondary altar, which is dedicated to Saint Sebastian survived the Baroque reconstruction of the church. The original altar, the work of Matthias Steindl, was taken to the Leopoldau Parish Church; the altar painting by Johann Georg Schmidt went to the museum at the Klosterneuburg Monastery. The Stations of the Cross are a newer addition; they were created in 1930/31 by Franz Zelezny. The key figures in the depiction of the Passion of Christ bear the faces of prominent personalities (such as Chancellor Ignaz Seipel) and inhabitants of Heiligenstadt.

Knight, 1902 Borophagus hilli is an extinct species of the genus Borophagus of the subfamily Borophaginae, a group of canids endemic to North America from the Late Miocene until the Pliocene.PaleoBiology Database: Borophagus dudleyi, basic info Overview Borophagus hilli was named by C. S. Johnston in 1939.C. S. Johnston. 1939. Journal of Paleontology Though not the most massive borophagine by size or weight, it had a more highly evolved capacity to crunch bone than earlier, larger genera such as Epicyon, which seems to be an evolutionary trend of the group (Turner, 2004). During the Pliocene epoch, Borophagus began being displaced by Canis genera such as Canis edwardii and later by Canis dirus. Early species of Borophagus were placed in the genus Osteoborus until recently, but the genera are now considered synonyms. Borophagus hilli possibly led a hyena-like lifestyle scavenging carcasses of recently dead animals. Taxonomy Typical features of this genus are a bulging forehead and powerful jaws; it was probably a scavenger.

French privateers operating from the Indian Ocean islands of √éle Bonaparte and √éle de France were a serious threat to British trade across the Indian Ocean during the Wars, and the British deployed numerous methods of intercepting them, including disguising warships as merchant vessels to lure privateers into unequal engagements with more powerful warships. Cruising near the Little Basses Reef on the Southern coast of Ceylon, the 34-gun privateer Bellone was sighted by the 16-gun British brig HMS Rattlesnake, which began chasing the larger French vessel. At 15:15, a third ship was sighted to the south, which proved to be the 74-gun ship of the line HMS Powerful, disguised as an East Indiaman. Although Bellone would normally be much faster than the large British warship, the light winds and Rattlesnake's determined pursuit prevented the privateer from escaping and at 17:00, Powerful was close enough to open fire. Despite the uneven nature of the combat, Bellone unexpectedly resisted the British attack for another hour and 45 minutes, causing more damage to Powerful than she received herself. The privateer was later taken into British service as a sixth rate frigate and prize money was paid for the captured vessels, but the action prompted questions in subsequent histories about the lack of efficiency in British gunnery. Background During the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars that followed them, British dominance in the Indian Ocean was repeatedly challenged by the depredations of French vessels sailing from the isolated and well protected French colonies of R√©union (later √éle Bonaparte) and √éle de France.The Victory of Seapower, Gardiner, p. 92 Although French Navy cruisers were periodically stationed on the islands, the majority of ships that preyed on British commerce from the islands were privateers, independently funded armed ships issued with letters of marque giving them permission to attack military and civilian ships belonging to the enemies of France.The Campaign of Trafalgar, Gardiner, p. 43 French naval strategy in the Indian Ocean was so reliant on privateers that entire squadrons developed, including a powerful force under the wealthy privateer captain Robert Surcouf. Although most privateers were small, carrying only a few cannon, some could be very large, rivalling professional warships in size. One such ship was the Bellone, which carried 34 guns, a crew of nearly 200 men and was commanded by Captain Jacques Fran√ßois Perroud, a notorious privateer who had caused significant damage to British trade in the Indian Ocean. In 1803, Perroud had gained significant notoriety with the capture of the valuable East Indiaman Lord Nelson on 14 August 1803.The Campaign of Trafalgar, Gardiner, p. 42 Bellone capturing the East Indiaman Lord Nelson on 14 August 1803. The principal target of the privateers were the East Indiamen, huge and well-armed merchant vessels operated by the Honourable East India Company, which controlled British mercantile operations to the east of Africa. These ships often weighed over 1,000 tons and carried as many as 30 cannon, although their crews were not military men and they could not usually resist a determined attack by a well-trained warship.Clowes, p. 337 Despite the size and power of these vessels, they were a primary target for French ships operating in the Indian Ocean as they often carried goods worth thousands of pounds: the annual convoy from China alone was worth over $8 million in 1804.The Campaign of Trafalgar, Gardiner, p. 32 To combat these ships, the British naval authorities at Madras tried a number of solutions, including blockades of the French island colonies which failed due to the huge distances involved, armed military convoys escorting the most valuable ships and small fast cruisers patrolling the most dangerous trade routes. One solution tried in 1806 was to disguise Royal Navy warships as the East Indiamen they superficially resembled in the hope of luring French ships into attacking them, unaware of their true identity. In December 1805, two French squadrons departed Brest under orders to disrupt British trade in the Atlantic Ocean, beginning the Atlantic campaign of 1806. Several British squadrons were despatched in pursuit, including one under Vice-Admiral Sir John Thomas Duckworth originally assigned to blockade Cadiz. On 25 December, Duckworth discovered one of the French squadrons, under Vice-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Willaumez, in the mid-Atlantic and gave chase. For the next two days the squadrons sailed westwards across the Atlantic, until Duckworth abandoned the pursuit, believing that his dispersed squadron was in danger of piecemeal defeat by Willaumez's force.James, p. 189 In the aftermath of the pursuit, Willaumez turned towards the South Atlantic while Duckworth, in urgent need of supplies, turned northwest towards the British West Indies. Duckworth was concerned that Willaumez might attempt to pass the Cape of Good Hope and operate in the Indian Ocean, and so despatched one of his ships to augment Rear-Admiral Sir Edward Pellew's small squadron at Madras. This ship was HMS Powerful, a 74-gun ship of the line commanded by Captain Robert Plampin.Clowes, p. 187 Battle On 9 July 1806, the small British brig HMS Rattlesnake under Commander John Bastard was cruising off the Southern coast of the British colony of Ceylon in search of French privateers that had been attacking small British traders, known as country ships, in the region. Most notorious of these was the Bellone, known to be operating in the area. In the early afternoon, lookouts on Rattlesnake spotted sails near the Little Basses Reef and approached the ship, which turned with the wind and fled to the southwest. Bastard immediately gave chase, and soon came close enough to identify the vessel as the Bellone. Although Bellone was much larger than the British warship, Captain Perroud was unwilling to risk his vessel in an unprofitable confrontation with Rattlesnake and seemed to be making an effective withdrawal when, at 15:15, a large ship came within sight directly ahead.James, p. 245 Although it was not immediately obvious to the men on Bellone, the new arrival was Plampin's Powerful, which had arrived in Indian waters on 13 June 1806. Finding no trace of Willaumez, who had elected to remain in the Atlantic, Plampin briefly anchored at Madras and subsequently cruised off Ceylon. There, following intelligence sent by Pellew, he captured the 20-gun French privateer Henriette near Trincomalee after an 11-hour chase. From information possibly supplied by prisoners removed from Henriette or possibly from a merchant ship sailing from Colombo, Plampin learned of Perroud's operations and had arranged to meet Rattlesnake off the Little Basses Reef. In the hope of luring the privateer into a confrontation, he disguised his large warship to look like an East Indiaman.Plampin, Robert, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, J. K. Laughton, (subscription required), Retrieved 26 July 2009 Perroud rapidly saw through the disguise, and also noticed that while the wind remained strong off the coast, Powerful was further out to sea and appeared becalmed. Realising that his only option was to sail between Powerful and the shore, Perroud turned eastwards, but the wind gradually strengthened for Powerful and by 17:00 the ship of the line was within range of Bellone with her bow chasers. Although faced with overwhelming opposition, Perroud did not surrender, maintaining a steady cannonade on the approaching ship of the line with Bellone's own stern chasers and occasionally turning to release a full broadside. The variable winds prevented Rattlesnake joining the battle and also delayed Powerful's approach; Bellone succeeded in causing casualties on Plampin's deck but failed to damage the ship of the line's rigging or sails, which would have facilitated her own escape. For an hour and 45 minutes the battle continued with neither ship able to land a decisive blow on the other, until, at 18:45, it was clear that Powerful would soon be within range with her main broadside. Perroud surrendered rather than see his ship destroyed.James, p. 246 Aftermath Although the defeat of Bellone by such an overwhelming force of professional warships would seem inevitable, the resistance given by the French privateer was considered impressive both at the time and by subsequent historians. Although largely undamaged, Powerful had suffered two men killed and 11 wounded, compared to French losses of one dead and six or seven wounded. Bellone was also largely undamaged, only surrendering when Powerful was in position to open a full broadside. After the battle, Bellone was taken into port and subsequently commissioned as HMS Blanche albeit with a reduction in class to a 28-gun sixth rate frigate. Head-money, a reward for the men captured or killed aboard enemy ships, was subsequently paid to the men of Powerful and Rattlesnake, as was head money for Henriette, although in both cases there was a delay in payment until January 1814. Pellew especially was delighted by the capture of Bellone, writing \\"I reflect with much pleasure on the capture of La Bellone in particular, as from her superior sailing, as her uncommon success in the present and preceding war against the commerce, in the Indian and European seas\\". Historical reaction to the engagement has focused on two aspects: Perroud's bravery in attempting to combat a vastly superior British force and the inaccuracy of Plampin's gunnery. Contemporary historian William James described Perroud's actions as \\"extraordinary\\" and notes that this was the second engagement in the Indian Ocean during 1806 in which British gunnery had proven ineffective, citing an inconclusive engagement on 21 April in which the 74-gun HMS Tremendous had been outgunned by the French frigate Canonni√®re, the frigate escaping pursuit by damaging the larger vessel's rigging. He also notes that Powerful was able to bring six guns into regular use during the engagement as opposed to Bellone's four, concluding that Plampin \\"might have made a better use of [the extra cannon]\\". Later historian William Laird Clowes, writing in 1900, agreed with James' assessment, commenting that \\"This action serves to again illustrate the lamentable decline in British gunnery\\".Clowes, p. 385  Notes Bibliography  Conflicts in 1806 Naval battles of the Napoleonic Wars Naval battles involving France Naval battles involving the United Kingdom July 1806 events 1800s in Sri Lanka ","title":"Action of 9 July 1806"},{"id":"23730595","text":"Ruth Forman is an American poet.

It is referred to as the \\"line defense\\" because of its formation on the court, which consists of two lines of defense. Three players at the front of the defense (at the half-court center line) and two players behind (between the center line and the team's own key). The line was the first zone concept to be used in basketball.Coach Don Casey & Ralph Pim, Own the Zone - Executing & attacking the zone defense, New York: McGraw Hill, 2008, pg. 16 The line defense was developed to counter the fast break plays that were being developed, and adopted, at the time. The line defense was the catalyst of the future 3-2 zone defense. How to play After the team has made a basket, or has turned over the ball, they will sprint back across the center line and turn around to pick up their checks. They form two lines of defense; the first line is made of three forwards and the second line is made of the two remaining guards. The first line allows the first two players to pass through the line (to be picked up by the two guards in the back) and then the forwards will challenge the remaining checks coming across the line. The plan was to make the other team lose the dribble or make a bad pass. The play was not a true zone as the players realigned themselves with their checks as they approached the center line, making the play a man-to-man defense. Strengths  * Helps turn the ball over before the opposing team has a chance to take a shot on basket. * Helps cover up potentially weak defensive players on the team. Weaknesses * Undefended basket ‚Äì because the defensive line was so far up from the defending key, any offensive player that got behind the line would have an easy time scoring a basket without a challenge. Breaking down Teams started to break down the line defense when they were able to get an offensive player(s) behind the line before the defending team was able to set up the defensive line. This helped to create plays such as the fly fast break, the fast break, or the 2-Out Fast break.

It differs from the main body of Optimal Foraging Theory in stating that animals can select food in order to make optimal use of their digestive tract (maximize digestion rate) rather than the maximization of the food ingestion rate, which is the base of Optimal foraging theory. The basic tenet of the DRM is that the intake of energy by an animal passes through two consecutive processes, food ingestion or foraging, and food digestion. Optimal foraging theory describes the diet selection if the food ingestion rate is the limiting factor. The DRM describes diet selection and foraging behavior if digestion is the rate limiting process. Food can consist of varying fractions of largely indigestible parts such as fibre in plant material, shells of molluscs or insect chitin, which can be thought of as 'rate limiting' for the digestion process or somewhat more intuitively as 'bulk' that takes up capacity that can be spent better for material with a higher digestibility. The original description of the model positioned the DRM as an alternative to the contingency model (CM) of optimal foraging and pointed out that some of the predictions of the DRM provide a better match than did the CM with observed diet choice and behavior of e.g. herbivores. The DRM went largely unnoticed, but a recent paper by Van Gils describes how red knots Calidris canutus forage based on digestive bottlenecks and confirmed their foraging according to the DRM rather than the CM model of optimal foraging. The case is particularly interesting as a major difference in individual foraging behavior is related to a large intraspecific difference in the digestive tract of the knots.

The effect of that conveyance was to confer a servitude right of access to the property from the public road for both pedestrian and vehicular traffic; and a right to stop vehicles on the servient tenement in order to turn, load and unload goods from them and set down and pick up passengers was accessory to the right of vehicular access. M claimed that there was also an accessory right to park vehicles on the servient tenement. The sheriff granted declarator that M were entitled to park vehicles on the servient tenement in the exercise of rights accessory to the servitude right of access and pronounced permanent interdict against J. The Court of Session dismissed an appeal. J submitted that it was not possible in the law of Scotland for there to be a servitude of parking; a permanent interdict was unnecessary and its terms were too uncertain to enable J to know what was prohibited by it. Judgment The appeal was dismissed. # A servitude right to park could be constituted as ancillary to a servitude right of vehicular access if it was necessary for the enjoyment of the servitude of access. # The express grant of a right of access had to be construed in the light of the circumstances that existed when it was granted in 1973, but it was not necessary for it to be shown that all the rights that were later claimed as necessary for the comfortable use and enjoyment of the servitude were actually in use at that date. It was sufficient that they might be considered to have been in contemplation at the time of the grant, having regard to what the dominant proprietor might reasonably be expected to do in the exercise of his right to convenient and comfortable use of the property, Ewart v Cochrane (1861) 4 Macq. 117 considered. In the particular and unusual circumstances of the instant case, the rights ancillary to the express grant of a right of access in favour of the dominant tenement included a right to park vehicles on the servient tenement, in so far as that was reasonably incidental to the enjoyment of the dominant tenement. # The history of the case justified the granting of interdict and in practice there ought to be no real difficulty in giving effect to the declarator or in enforcement of the interdict. The House of Lords recognised that easements must always be exercised civiliter (without amounting to exclusive possession over the servient land), but the House of Lords displayed a more sympathetic attitude to easements that substantially exclude the servient owner. Obiter, the court also recognised the possibility of a servitude right of parking in Scottish law and an easement of parking in English law.

In Scotland, the first Lithuanians came during the latter part of the 19th century. Between 1886 and 1914, around one in four Lithuanians emigrated from Lithuania, with most of those leaving doing so in the 1890s and 1900s. Some of these emigrants were avoiding conscription into the Russian military, some were Lithuanian freedom fighters, others were Jews escaping persecution, and some were fleeing poverty.

He became ruler over the Polish Seniorate Province at Krak√≥w and thereby High Duke of Poland in 1177; a position he held until his death, though interrupted once by his elder brother and predecessor Mieszko III the Old. In 1186 Casimir also inherited the Duchy of Masovia from his nephew Leszek, becoming the progenitor of the Masovian branch of the royal Piast dynasty, and great-grandfather of the later Polish king W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high. The honorific title \\"the Just\\" was not contemporary and first appeared in the 16th century. Early life Casimir, the sixth but fourth surviving son of Boles≈Çaw III Wrymouth, Duke of Poland, by his second wife Salomea, daughter of Count Henry of Berg, was born in 1138, probably on the brink of his father's death. It is also possible that he was born shortly after, and as a consequence was posthumous. This may explain why he was not mentioned in the Boles≈Çaw III's Testament, and thus left without any land. During his first years, Casimir and his sister Agnes (born in 1137) lived with their mother Salomea in her widow land of ≈Åƒôczyca. There, the young prince remained far away from the struggles of his brothers Boles≈Çaw IV the Curly and Mieszko III the Old with their older half-brother High Duke W≈Çadys≈Çaw II, who tried to reunite all of Poland under his rule (contrary to his late father's testament) and was finally expelled in 1146. Salomea of Berg had died in 1144. Casimir and Agnes were cared for by their elder brother Boles≈Çaw IV, who assumed the high ducal title two years later. Although under his tutelage the young prince could feel safe, he had no guarantee to receive part of the paternal inheritance in the future. When in 1154 he reached the proper age (according to the standards of that time) to assume control over some of the lands of the family, he remained with nothing. Three years later (1157), his situation worsened as a result of the successful Polish campaign of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, who came to the aid of W≈Çadys≈Çaw II and his sons. As a part of the treaty Boles≈Çaw IV had to conclude with Barbarossa, Casimir was sent to Germany as a hostage in order to secure the loyalty of his brother to the Emperor. The fate of Casimir at the Imperial Court is unknown. He returned to Poland certainly before 21 May 1161, because on that day he is mentioned in a document along with two of his brothers, Boles≈Çaw IV and Henry of Sandomierz. Duke at Wi≈õlica In 1166, Casimir's brother Henry was killed in battle during a Prussian Crusade. He died without issue, and in his will he named Casimir the only heir of his Lesser Polish Duchy of Sandomierz. However, High Duke Boles≈Çaw IV decided to divide the duchy into three parts: the largest (which included the capital, Sandomierz) he gave to himself; a second unnamed portion he granted to Mieszko III the Old, and only the third part, the small district of Wi≈õlica, was given to Casimir. Angry and disappointed with the decision of the High Duke, Casimir rebelled against him, with the support of his brother Mieszko, the magnate Jaksa of Miech√≥w, Sviatoslav son of Piotr W≈Çostowic, Archbishop Jan of Gniezno, and Bishop Gedko of Krak√≥w. Casimir also had the support of almost all of Lesser Poland. Quick actions by Boles≈Çaw IV stopped the rebellion, and in the end, Casimir was only able to retain Wi≈õlica. In 1172, Mieszko III again rebelled against the High Duke, and tried to persuade his younger brother to join him. For unknown reasons, Casimir refused to participate this time. thumb260pxPolish acquisitions of Casimir: Boles≈Çaw IV died in 1173 and according to the principle of agnatic seniority he was succeeded as High Duke by Mieszko III the Old, the oldest surviving brother. Mieszko decided to give the entire Sandomierz duchy to Casimir, and so Casimir finally assumed the ducal title that his late brother had usurped. Revolt against Mieszko III the Old The strong and dictatorial rule of the new High Duke caused a deep disaffection among the Lesser Polish nobility. This time a new revolt instigated in 1177 had a real chance of victory. The rebellion, apart of the magnates, counted upon the support of Gedko, Bishop of Krak√≥w; Mieszko's eldest son Odon; Duke Boles≈Çaw I the Tall of Silesia, the son of former High Duke W≈Çadys≈Çaw II; and Casimir. The reasons for his inclusion in this revolt, after being reconciled with Mieszko, are unknown. The battle for new leadership took quite strange course: Mieszko III, completely surprised by the rebels in his Duchy of Greater Poland, withdrew to Pozna≈Ñ, where he stayed for almost two years enduring heavy fighting with his son Odon. Finally, he was defeated and was forced to escape. Duke Boles≈Çaw the Tall failed to conquer Krak√≥w and the Seniorate Province, as he himself was stuck in an inner-Silesian conflict with his brother Mieszko I Tanglefoot and his own son Jaros≈Çaw; soon defeated, he asked Casimir for help. After a successfully action in Silesia, Casimir marched to Krak√≥w, which was quickly mastered. Casimir, now Duke of Krak√≥w, decided to conclude a treaty under which Boles≈Çaw the Tall obtained full authority over Lower Silesia at Wroc≈Çaw, and in return Casimir granted the Lesser Polish districts of Bytom, O≈õwiƒôcim and Pszczyna to the then deposed Mieszko I Tanglefoot as a gift for Casimir's godson and namesake Casimir I of Opole, the only son of Mieszko I Tanglefoot. High Duke of Poland The 1177 rebellion against High Duke Mieszko III the Old was a complete success for Casimir, who not only conquered Krak√≥w (including the districts of Sieradz and ≈Åƒôczyca) obtaining the high ducal title, but also managed to extend his sovereignty as Polish monarch over Silesia (then divided between the three sons of W≈Çadys≈Çaw II: Boles≈Çaw the Tall, Mieszko I Tanglefoot, and Konrad Spindleshanks, as well as Boles≈Çaw's son Jaros≈Çaw of Opole), Greater Poland (ruled by Odon), and Masovia and Kuyavia (ruled by Duke Leszek, then a minor and under the tutelage of his mother and the voivode ≈ªyrona, one of Casimir's followers). On the Baltic coast, Pomerelia (Gda≈Ñsk Pomerania) was ruled by Duke Sambor I as a Polish vassal. Mieszko III the Old worked intensively for his return, however; at first in Bohemia and later in Germany and in the Duchy of Pomerania. In order to achieve his ambitions and give the hereditary right to the throne at Krak√≥w (and with this the Seniorate Province) to his descendants, Casimir called an assembly of Polish nobles at ≈Åƒôczyca in 1180. He granted privileges to both the nobility and the Church, lifting a tax on the profits of the clergy and relinquishing his rights over the lands of deceased bishops. By these acts, he won the acceptance of the principle of hereditary succession to Krak√≥w, though it still would take more than a century to restore the Polish kingship. However, in the first half of 1181 (and less than a year after the ≈Åƒôczyca assembly), Mieszko III the Old, with the assistance of Duke Sambor's brother Mestwin I of Pomerelia, conquered the eastern Greater Polish lands of Gniezno and Kalisz and managed to persuade his son Odon to submit (according to some historians, Odon then received from his father the Greater Polish lands south of the Obra River). At the same time, Duke Leszek of Masovia decided to leave the influence of Casimir. He named Mieszko III the Old's son Mieszko the Younger as governor of Masovia and Kuyavia, and with this, made a tacit promise regarding the succession of these lands. Foreign affairs For unknown reasons, Casimir chose not to react to these events and decided only to secure his authority over Lesser Poland. A diplomatic meeting occurred in 1184 at the court of the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa where Casimir, in order to block the actions of Mieszko III the Old and retain power as High Duke of Poland, swore allegiance to Barbarossa and paid him a large tribute. The most important issues during the reign of Casimir, beside the conflicts with his brother Mieszko, were the diplomatic policies towards the neighbouring Russian principalities in the east. The first task before him as High Duke was to create bonds with the Rurik Grand Princes at Kiev, who were strongly associated with the previous High Dukes through their marriages to Kievan princesses (Boles≈Çaw IV the Curly with Viacheslava of Novgorod and Mieszko III the Old with Eudoxia of Kiev). For this purpose, in November 1178 Casimir arranged the marriage of his daughter with Prince Vsevolod IV of Kiev. His first major intervention in Kievan Rus' affairs occurred in 1180, when the High Duke supported Vasylko, Prince of Shumsk and Drohiczyn (and son-in-law of the late Boles≈Çaw IV the Curly), and his nephew Leszek of Masovia in a dispute with Vladimir of Minsk for the region of Volhynia at Volodymyr-Volynsky. The war ended with the success of Vladimir, who conquered Volodymyr and Brest, while Vasylko held his ground at Drohiczyn. However, this war did not definitively settle the matter of the rule at Brest, which had been granted as a fief to Prince Sviatoslav, Vasylko's cousin and Casimir's nephew (stepson of his sister Agnes). In 1182 a revolt broke out against Sviatoslav's rule, but thanks to Casimir's intervention, he was restored on the throne. Nevertheless, shortly afterwards Casimir saw that the situation was unstable, and so he finally decided to give the power to Sviatoslav's half-brother, Roman. In 1187, Prince Yaroslav Osmomysl of Halych died, whereafter a long struggle for his succession began. Initially, the authority over the principality was taken by his younger illegitimate son, Oleg, but he was soon murdered by the boyars. Halych was then taken by Yaroslav's eldest son, Vladimirko. Vladimirko's reign was also far from stable, a situation used by Prince Roman of Brest, who, with the help of his uncle Casimir, deposed him and took full control over Halych. The defeated Vladimirko fled to the Kingdom of Hungary under the protection of King B√©la III (his relative; Vladimirko's paternal grandmother was a Hungarian princess), who decided to send his army to Halych. Roman escaped to Krak√≥w and Vladimirko, as an act of revenge, invaded Lesser Poland. However, King B√©la III soon decided to attach Halych to Hungary, and again deposed Vladimirko, replacing him as Prince of Halych with his own son, Andrew. The war continued for another two years, until Casimir restored Vladimirko's authority over Halych following instructions from Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, who had decided to help Vladimirko after he had declared himself to be his subject. Internal Politics In 1186 Duke Leszek of Masovia died. Before his death the sickly duke decided to give all his lands to High Duke Casimir. Though Leszek had previously promised the inheritance to his elder uncle Mieszko III, his dictatorial proceedings caused Leszek to change his mind and decide in Casimir's favor. Shortly after Leszek's death however, Mieszko III occupied the lands of Kuyavia up to the Vistula River, and Casimir could only take possession over Masovia proper. Nevertheless, thanks to the Masovian inheritance, Casimir directly ruled over the major part of Poland. The involvement of Casimir in the Russian affairs was used in 1191 by Mieszko III, who managed to take control over Wawel Castle at Krak√≥w, seizing the high ducal title and the control over the Seniorate Province. Immediately, he declared Krak√≥w an hereditary fief to his own descendants, implementing his son Mieszko the Younger as a governor. The conflict ended peacefully, as Casimir ‚Äì upon his return from Russia ‚Äì regained the capital without a fight, and Mieszko the Younger escaped to the side of his father. The last goal of Casimir's reign was at the beginning of 1194, when he organized an expedition against the Baltic Yotvingians. The expedition ended with a full success, and Casimir had a triumphant return to Krak√≥w. After a banquet was held to celebrate his return, Casimir died unexpectedly, on 5 May 1194. Some historians believed that he was poisoned. He was succeeded as High Duke by his eldest surviving son Leszek I the White, who like his father had to face the strong opposition from Mieszko III the Old. Casimir was probably buried at Wawel Cathedral. Casimir had planned to found a University in Krak√≥w and already started to construct the building, but his sudden death balked his plans. The present-day Jagiellonian University was not established until 1364 by King Casimir III the Great as the second oldest in Central and Eastern Europe (after the Charles University in Prague). Relations with the Church During his reign, Casimir was very generous to the Church, especially with the Cistercians monasteries of WƒÖchock, Jƒôdrzej√≥w, Koprzywnica and Sulej√≥w; with the Canons of the Holy Sepulchre of Miech√≥w and Regular Canonry of Czerwi≈Ñsk nad Wis≈ÇƒÖ and Trzemeszno and the Order of the Knights Hospitaller in Zago≈õƒá. He also tried to expand the cult of Saint Florian, whose remains were brought to Krak√≥w by Bishop Gedko. Marriage and issue Between 1160-1165 (but no later than 1166), Casimir married with Helena (ca. 1140/42 ‚Äì ca. 1202/06), daughter of Duke Conrad II of Znojmo, scion of a Moravian cadet branch of the P≈ôemyslid dynasty. They had: # A daughter (name unknown) (b. before 1167), married between 11 October and 24 December 1178 to Prince Vsevolod IV of Kiev. # Casimir (ca. 1162 ‚Äì 2 February or 1 March 1167), named after his father. # Boles≈Çaw (ca. 1168/71 ‚Äì 16 April 1182/83), probably named after his paternal grandfather Boles≈Çaw III Wrymouth, although it is possible that he was named in honour of his uncle Boles≈Çaw IV the Curly. He died accidentally, after falling from a tree. He was probably buried at Wawel Cathedral. # Odon (1169/84 ‚Äì died in infancy). He was probably named after either Odon of Pozna≈Ñ or Saint Odo of Cluny. # Adelaide (ca. 1177/84 ‚Äì 8 December 1211), foundress of the convent of St. Jakob in Sandomierz. # Leszek I the White (ca. 1184/85 ‚Äì 24 November 1227) # Konrad (ca. 1187/88‚Äì 31 August 1247) NotesReferencesBibliography * page=267}} 1130s births 1194 deaths 12th-century Polish monarchs Dukes of Masovia Polish Roman Catholics ","title":"Casimir II the Just"},{"id":"23730756","text":"Get Stoked on It! is the debut studio album by American rock band The Wonder Years, released through No Sleep Records on October 30, 2007.

The keyboard has \\"divided black keys\\" in order to tune the instrument in two different keys (in meantone temperament). broken octave scheme. Archicembalo keyboard in cents. A split sharp is a kind of key found in some early keyboard instruments, such as the harpsichord, clavichord, or organ. It is a musical key divided in two, with separately depressible front and back sections, each sounding its own pitch. The particular keys that were split were those that play the sharps and flats on the standard musical keyboard (the \\"black keys\\" on a modern piano). Split sharps served two distinct purposes. First, in the broken octave, they allowed an instrument to include deep bass notes while retaining a short, compact keyboard. Second, in older music, tuning was generally not done by equal temperament, which treats note pairs such as A and B as the same pitch. Instead, they were assigned slightly different pitches on enharmonic keyboards (particularly in \\"meantone temperament\\"). This allowed certain musical intervals, such as the major third, to sound closer to their ideal just value, hence more closely tuned to just intonation. Split sharps present advantages and disadvantages: \\"Obviously this would have its advantages under some circumstances in terms of intonation. However, the complexities of fingering and hand position dictated by such a keyboard configuration presented problems.\\"Donahue, Thomas (2005). A Guide to Musical Temperament, p.36. Scarecrow. .

Plot summary Nyle T. Milner, a hard-working agricultural historian, is busy researching and working on a book about the early harrow. He is in the process of traveling to the Museum of the Tractor located in Harvey, New York for the fourth time. He asks Bill Fipton for recommendations of accommodations, and Bill offers up \\"The Taits\\" inn stating that they make an \\"interesting\\" soup. He explores the hotel room and comes across a Mr. Potato Head Kit. He opens the box quickly and is surprised to find a real potato with all the facial features still punctured into it. The mummified potato startles him. Following his encounter with the potato, Nyle makes his way down from his room for dinner. He learns that the menu was leek and potato soup; however, he is the only one eating it. After some time, he mentions the Mr. Potato Head Kit he had found earlier and states how it had startled him. After dinner, Mrs. Tait leads Nyle into the kitchen, revealing to him dozens of potatoes all shapes and sizes and making sure to mention that they only use \\"fresh\\" ones. Nyle leaves the Taits and proceeds to his room. While trying to fall asleep he wondered why Mrs. Tait used the word \\"fresh\\". He wakes up to venture back downstairs to the kitchen, though when he gets to the door he notices a sprout coming through the keyhole. He opens the door and notices a dozen or more potatoes coming toward him. Nyle goes back inside and tries to blockade the door. The potatoes are coming after him. Nyle tries to escape; however, the dead Mr. Potato Head's spuds spawn veer toward Nyle's face, causing him to fall. The potatoes begin to inhabit his body planting themselves within. After some time Nyle wakes up in a very dark place - the box he originally encountered upon his arrival at \\"The Taits\\". A child begins pushing the Mr. Potato Head features into Nyle and puts him back into the box. Many years later, a man opens the box and is frightened by the mummified potato which ultimately begins the new Krebs Cycle.

Members of its subfamily, Borophaginae, are loosely known as \\"bone-crushing\\" or \\"hyena-like\\" dogs. Though not the most massive borophagine by size or weight, it had a more highly evolved capacity to crunch bone than earlier, larger genera such as Epicyon, which seems to be an evolutionary trend of the group (Turner, 2004). During the Pliocene epoch, Borophagus began being displaced by Canis genera such as Canis edwardii and later by Canis dirus. Early species of Borophagus were placed in the genus Osteoborus until recently, but the genera are now considered synonyms. B. diversidens possibly led a hyena-like lifestyle scavenging carcasses of recently dead animals. Taxonomy Typical features of this genus are a bulging forehead and powerful jaws; it was probably a scavenger. Its crushing premolar teeth and strong jaw muscles would have been used to crack open bone, much like the hyena of the Old World. The adult animal is estimated to have been about in length, similar to a coyote, although it was much more powerfully built. Recombination Borophagus diversidens was recombined as Dinocyon (Borophagus) diversidens by Matthew in 1902 and then recombined as Dinocyon diversidens by Matthew the same year. It was recombined as Hyaenarctos diversidens. Fossil distribution Borophagus diversidens fossil specimens are very widespread from 2 sites in central Florida to central Mexico, from western Oregon and western Washington to New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas.

Life Considius held the praetorship at an unknown date, not later than 52 BC,Brennan (2000) II 546, discusses possible dates, with references to earlier literature. He also discusses the possibility (no more) that, if Considius is the praetor of 52, he could be the otherwise unknown Considius who presided over the trial of M.

During his administration, in 50 BC, he travelled to Rome to seek the consulship, leaving Quintus Ligarius as his representative.Cic. Lig. 2; Schol. Cic. Gron. D p. 291, 4-6; M√ºnzer (1901), 913. When the Roman civil war broke out, he returned to Africa with other supporters of Pompey. He and P. Attius Varus are described as legatus pro praetore in an inscription from Curubis (modern Korba), which they fortified: they would have held the office as subordinate commanders first to Pompey, then, after Pompey's death in 48 BC, to Metellus Scipio, who succeeded Pompey to command of the senatorial side against Julius Caesar.CIL VIII 24099; M√ºnzer (1901), 913.

Shortly after this he was in the town of Thysdra (modern El Djem) with soldiers and a retinue of gladiators and Gaetulians. It was here that he learnt that Caesar had been victorious at the battle of Thapsus. He left the town secretly, attempting to escape to Numidia, ruled by his ally, Juba I.

The genus in the current taxonomic classification was first termed by Hibberd (1981). The species have mostly been known from the marine environment but also occur in fresh and brackish water. All of the species are small, nonmotile spheres which do not express any distinct morphological features that can be distinguished by either light or electron microscopy. The characterisation is mostly done by rbcL gene and 18S rRNA sequence analysis. The algae of the genus Nannochloropsis differ from other related microalgae in that they have chlorophyll a and completely lack chlorophyll b and chlorophyll c. In addition they are able to build up a high concentrations of a range of pigments such as astaxanthin, zeaxanthin and canthaxanthin. They have a diameter of about 2 to 3 micrometers and a very simple ultrastructure with reduced structural elements compared to neighbouring taxa. Nannochloropsis is considered a promising alga for industrial applications because of its ability to accumulate high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Moreover, it shows promising features that can allow genetic manipulation aimed at the genetic improvement of the current oleaginous strains. Various species of Nannochloropsis indeed are transfectable and there has been evidence that some strains are able to perform homologous recombination. At the moment it is mainly used as an energy-rich food source for fish larvae and rotifers. Nevertheless, it has raised growing interest also for the investigation of biofuel production from photosynthetic organisms. (see Nannochloropsis and biofuels). Nannochloropsis is actually in use as food additive for human nutrition and it is also served at Restaurant \\"A Poniente\\" of El Puerto de Santa Mar√≠a (C√°diz, Spain) close to the natural environment where Nannochloropsis gaditana was first isolated and still grows.  Species  The species currently recognised are: * Nannochloropsis australis Fawley, Jameson & Fawley 2015 * Nannochloropsis gaditana Lubi√°n 1982 * Nannochloropsis granulata Karlson & Potter 1996 * Nannochloropsis limnetica Krienitz et al. 2000 * Nannochloropsis oceanica Suda & Miyashita 2002 * Nannochloropsis oculata (Droop 1955) Hibberd 1981 * Nannochloropsis salina Hibberd 1981  Sequenced genomes  The scientific community has obtained the genomic sequence of different strains of Nannochloropsis belonging to two species: N. gaditana and N. oceanica. A genome portal based on the N. gaditana B-31 genome allows accessing much of the genomic information that concerns this micro- organism, moreover dedicated web pages are also available for the genomes of N. gaditana CCMP526 and N. oceanica CCMP1779. The genomes of the sequenced Nannochloropsis strains were between 28.5 and 29 Mega bases long, they had high density of genes, reduced intron content, short intergenic regions and very limited presence of repetitive sequences. The genes of the two species share extended similarity. The analysis of the genomes revealed that these microalgae have set of genes for the synthesis and incorporation in the cell wall of cellulose and sulfated fucans and that they are able to store carbon in polymers of Œ≤-1,3- and Œ≤-1,6-linked glucose called chrysolaminarin. An NMR analysis of whole algal cells which were cultivated in autotrophic growth reports evidence of the presence of cellulose in the cell wall and of mobile chrysolaminarin, probably accumulated in solution in vacuoles inside the cell. Comparison between the lipid metabolic genes of N. gaditana and of red/green/brown algae and diatoms provided some insights into the exemplary lipid production of Nannochloropsis cultures. The comparisons indeed highlighted the presence of an expanded repertoire of some of the genes involved in TAG assembly in Nannochloropsis. Numerous TAG lipases, which can affect TAG metabolism through either TAG degradation or lipid remodeling, were identified in Nannochloropsis, many of them belonging to a gene family which seems to be exclusive of Nannochloropsis.Elisa Corteggiani Carpinelli e Nicola Vitulo Unpublished data available through the Nannochloropsis gaditana genome portal Analysis of the genomic data suggested the presence in both the two species of Nannochloropsis of regulatory RNA and in particular miRNA. Various orthologs of known blue light sensing proteins were found in the genomes of Nannochloropsis suggesting possible circadian regulation. A research community from Qingdao Institute of Bioenergy and Bioprocess Technology (QIBEBT ), Chinese Academy of Sciences, sequenced and compared six Nannochloropsis genomes that include two N. oceanica strains (IMET1 and CCMP531) and one strain from each of four other recognized species: N. salina (CCMP537), N. gaditana (CCMP526, which was previously reported), N. oculata (CCMP525) and N. granulata (CCMP529). They found that the six genomes share key oleaginous traits, such as the gene dose expansion of selected lipid biosynthesis genes compared to green algae Chlamydomonas. The most prominent example of gene dose expansion is Diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT), which catalyzes the last step of triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis. There are 13 DGAT genes in Nannochloropsis, representing the highest gene dose in known genomes. Through a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis, researchers proposed that among the 11 DGAT-2s, one gene might originate from the red algae related secondary endosymbiont, four from green algae related endosymbiont, and the other six from the eukaryotic host genome. In addition, a large proportion (15.3%) of TAG biosynthesis related genes were acquired by Nannochloropsis via horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from bacteria. Therefore, multiple genome pooling and horizontal genetic exchange, together with selective inheritance of lipid synthesis genes and species-specific gene loss, have led to the enormous genetic apparatus for oleaginousness and the wide genomic divergence among present-day Nannochloropsis spp.  Accumulation of oil in nitrogen deprivation  When cultured in normal growth conditions in standard f/2 medium supplemented with nitrogen, Nannochloropsis cells have an oil content of about 30% of their dry weight. This oil can be used to produce biodiesel. In order to produce biodiesel, the oil content of Nannochloropsis cultures must be increased. Fatty acid biosynthesis in N. oceanica was shown to be integrated with the regulation of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, suggesting new genetic engineering or chemical biology approaches for enhanced oil production in microalgae. On the other hand, various culturing conditions were observed to increase the average oil content per cell, supporting however only slow growth rates of the cultures (see the related section Nannochloropsis and biofuels), and decreasing the overall productivity. Among these conditions, nitrogen deprivation has been one of the most vastly studied. Studies have examined the behaviour of the cultures in nitrogen stress in various culturing set-ups, as well as the physiological and molecular response of the cells to nitrogen deprivation. Various strains of Nannochloropsis were shown to accumulate up to 60‚Äì70% of their overall biomass as lipids in nitrogen limitation. In this condition not only the amount of lipids changes, but also the composition. It was observed that triacylglycerols largely increase in nitrogen depletion while other lipids, mainly polar glycerolipids, free fatty acids and diacylglycerols, slightly decrease. The increase in triacylglycerols in nitrogen depletion is much larger than the decrease in the other glycerolipids, supporting the hypothesis that the cells actively synthesise new triacylglycerols rather than just transforming the existing lipids into triacylglycerols. While triacylglycerols accumulate and lipid droplets enlarge, other important morphological changes take place. The chloroplasts became smaller and the amount of lipids that are characteristic of the photosynthetic membranes decrease significantly. Photosynthetic yield decreases in the nitrogen depleted cells, but it is still sufficient to drive cell survival and growth. If photosynthesis is inhibited indeed, Nannochloropsis cells stop growing, indicating that they rely on photosynthetic solar energy conversion and not on stored carbohydrates or lipids as energy source. Nannochloropsis cultivated in normal growth condition and deprived of a nitrogen source continues growing for 4‚Äì5 days. The analysis of gene expression reveals that mechanisms for nitrogen assimilation and redistribution are activated in the cells in nitrogen scarcity and allow survival through a partial reorganisation of the cellular metabolism. The genes responsible for the incorporation of free ammonium into glutamate (L-glutamine + 2-oxoglutarate + NADPH + H+ ‚Üê‚Üí 2 L-glutamate + NADP+) are up- regulated . Their up-regulation increases the capability of the cells to assimilate minimal amount of ammonium eventually present in the medium and, more importantly, allows them to assimilate the intracellular ammonium that can be released by degradative processes. Transcriptomic data of nitrogen- deprived Nannochloropsis cultures show that various enzymes responsible for degradative processes that release ammonium are indeed up regulated. Moreover, the expression of genes coding for proteins involved in controlled degradation of proteins increase, together with others involved in the formation of cytosolic sequestering vesicles used for degradation and recycling of cellular components. The machinery of gene expression of chloroplast and mitochondrion is down regulated in Nannochloropsis in response to nitrogen depletion. Corteggiani Carpinelli and coworkers (2013) report a complete analysis of the gene expression of Nannochloropsis cultures grown in normal conditions and nitrogen deprivation for 3 days and 6 days. Data on similar conditions were also collected by Radakovits et al. (2012) and Vieler et al. (2012). The all of this data show that genes involved in fatty acid and triacylglycerol biosynthesis are always abundant in the cells and their expression is not correlated with the amount of oil accumulated. Also the expression of the genes involved in triacylglycerols degradation is not significantly down- regulated as triacylglycerols accumulate. The general conclusion suggested by the experimental data is that Nannochloropsis constitutively produces triacylglycerols and that the metabolic reorganisation that follows nitrogen deprivation increases the flux of substrates through this pathway, which is in turn capable to sustain the increased metabolic flux. Corteggiani Carpinelli and coworkers (2013) advance the hypothesis that, in their experimental conditions, photosynthesis is the main energy source and the down-regulation of the metabolic activity of the mitochondrion is determinant in increasing the amount of substrates that enter the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway. If more precursors are available, more fatty acids are synthesised and as a consequence more triacylglycerols are produced and accumulated into the cells as oil droplets. Dong et al. (2013) report a quantification of the abundance of various proteins in cultures of Nannochloropsis grown with a supplement of CO2 and deprived of nitrogen. Despite the different experimental conditions, also the proteomic study seems to support the hypothesis that the accumulation of triacylglycerols is due to an increase of the metabolic flux through the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway. The authors advance the hypothesis that, in their experimental conditions, the degradation of storage sugars and the up- regulation of glycolysis are responsible for the increase of substrates through the pathway. More recently Li and coworkers (2014) collected extensive experimental data from cultures of Nannochloropsis oculata IMET1 grown in nitrogen sufficient and nitrogen depleted media. According to their analysis it is the catabolism of carbohydrates and proteins together with the up- regulation of genes assigned to various pathways (the cytosolic glycolysis pathway, which produces pyruvate; the PDHC bypass, which yields additional acetyl-CoA; and the coupling of TCA reactions with mitochondrial Œ≤-oxidation) that have to be claimed for increasing the supply of carbon precursors to the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway. Nevertheless, the authors suggest that it isn't the increased synthesis of fatty acids that leads to accumulation of oil inside the cells, but it is rather the up-regulation of genes involved in the assembly of triacylglycerols that determines the final oil concentration. In other words, under nitrogen depletion, it is the up-regulation of the transcript level of the key genes in triacylglycerol assembly, rather than those in fatty acids biosynthesis, that leads to accelerated triacylglycerol production. In 2017, a study jointly funded by ExxonMobil and Synthetic Genomics achieved a breakthrough in lipid percentages in Nannochloropsis gaditana through applications of the CRISPR-Cas9 reverse-genetics pipeline and nitrogen starving‚Äîimproving partitioning of total carbon to lipids from 20% (wild type) to 40-45% (mutant type).

Borophagus littoralis existed for approximately .PaleoBiology Database: Borophagus littoralis, basic info Overview Borophagus littoralis was named by Cope in 1892 and is considered synonymous with Osteoborus diabloensis. Borophagus littoralis, like other Borophaginae, are loosely known as \\"bone-crushing\\" or \\"hyena-like\\" dogs. Though not the most massive borophagine by size or weight, it had a more highly evolved capacity to crunch bone than earlier, larger genera such as Epicyon, which seems to be an evolutionary trend of the group (Turner, 2004). During the Pliocene epoch, Borophagus began being displaced by Canis genera such as Canis edwardii and later by Canis dirus. Early species of Borophagus were placed in the genus Osteoborus until recently, but the genera are now considered synonyms. Borophagus littoralis possibly led a hyena-like lifestyle scavenging carcasses of recently dead animals. Taxonomy Typical features of this genus are a bulging forehead and powerful jaws; it was probably a scavenger. Its crushing premolar teeth and strong jaw muscles would have been used to crack open bone, much like the hyena of the Old World. The adult animal is estimated to have been about 80 cm in length, similar to a coyote, although it was much more powerfully built.

Life Miguel del √Åguila was born in Montevideo. In 1978, del √Åguila moved to California, fleeing Uruguay's 1970's repressive military government.Civic-military dictatorship of Uruguay After graduating from the San Francisco Conservatory of Music he traveled to Vienna, where he studied at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik and Konservatorium. Early premieres of his works in Vienna's Musikverein, Konzerthaus and B√∂sendorfer halls introduced his music and distinctive Latin sound to European audiences. In 1989, del √Åguila introduced his works in New York's Carnegie Recital Hall (now Weill Hall), and Lukas Foss conducted the U.S. premiere of del √Åguila's Hexen with the Brooklyn Philharmonic. CDs of his works were released on Albany Records and KKM-Austria by 1990, works including his Clarinet Concerto, \\"Herbsttag\\", and \\"Hexen\\". Del √Åguila returned to the U.S. in 1992, where soon The Los Angeles Times described him as \\"one of the West Coast's most promising and enterprising young composers.\\" He received the Kennedy Center Friedheim Award in 1995, and was music director of Ojai Camerata until 1999. He was resident composer at Chautauqua Institution Summer Festival from 2001 to 2005 Del √Åguila was among the first group of composers chosen by Meet the Composer and The American Symphony Orchestra League to receive a Music Alive Extended Residency grant, resulting in the 2006 opera Time and Again Barelas, a partnership between the New Mexico Symphony and the National Hispanic Cultural Center in Albuquerque. Joanne Sheehy Hoover of the Albuquerque Journal wrote that the opera ‚Äúdisplayed his command of an arresting musical vocabulary, marked by a complex yet infectious rhythmic vitality.‚Äù In 2008, del √Åguila received a \\"Magnum Opus\\" commission administered by Meet the Composer, for performances by the Nashville Symphony, Buffalo Philharmonic, Virginia Symphony, and Winnipeg Symphony.

Origins He was born on 27 December 1679 in Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury, London, the only son of John Le Neve (d.1693, buried in Westminster Abbey 2 August 1693Vivian, Lt.Col. J.L., (Ed.)

His grandfather, another John Le Neve, resided firstly at Cavendish, Suffolk and later in St. Martin's-in-the-Fields, London. His father's first wife had been Frances Monck (1633-1677), buried in Westminster Abbey, a daughter of Colonel Thomas Monck of Potheridge, Devon, the brother of General George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle (1608-1670), by whom he had a daughter Mary le Neve, who died an infant.Vivian, Lt.Col. J.L., (Ed.) The Visitations of the County of Devon: Comprising the Heralds' Visitations of 1531, 1564 & 1620, Exeter, 1895, pp.569-70, pedigree of Monk of Potheridge His uncle Richard le Neve (d.1673) was a sea-captain who died in action against the Dutch in 1673 and was buried in Westminster Abbey, while another of his uncles, Edmund le Neve (d. 1689), was a barrister of the Middle Temple. Youth and education Le Neve's mother died on 12 December 1687, when he was eight years old, and at the age of twelve he was sent to Eton College as an oppidan. His father died on 20 July 1693 when Le Neve was fourteen, and was buried in Westminster Abbey, as were both his wives. He succeeded to a small amount of property and became a ward of his kinsman (whose exact relationship to him has not been traced) Peter Le Neve (1661-1729), the herald and antiquary. Another of his guardians was his first cousin John Boughton, whose sister he married in 1699. From Eton he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was admitted in 1694 and matriculated in 1696, but left without taking a degree. Career All his works were loss-making, and he fell into difficulties. At the age of 41 he took holy orders and in January 1722 was presented by his patron William Fleetwood to the rectory of Thornton-le-Moor in Lincolnshire. His creditors pursued him and in December 1722 he was imprisoned in Lincoln gaol for insolvency. Marriage and progeny Le Neve married by licence dated 25 January 1698‚Äì9 at St. George's, Southwark, his first cousin Frances Boughton, second daughter of Thomas Boughton of Kings Cliffe, Northamptonshire by his wife Elizabeth Le Neve, sister of Le Neve's father father. By his wife Le Neve had eight children. Death He died at some time before 23 May 1741. Works *Memoirs etc. His first work seems to have been published in 1712-14Memoirs, British and Foreign, of the Lives and Families of the most Illustrious Persons who died in the years 1711 and 1712,' 2 vols. This was probably suggested to him by his kinsman Peter, whose collections were at his service. *Fasti Ecclesi√¶ Anglican√¶. Le Neve's major work, his Fasti Ecclesi√¶ Anglican√¶, or an Essay towards a regular Succession of all the principal Dignitaries, &c.;, appeared in 1716 in folio. It borrowed from White Kennett's Collections, but depended also on original research. Before the end of the century twenty copies existed which had been annotated and brought up to date by other antiquaries. Browne Willis tried to convince Le Neve to update his first publication.Preface to Browne Willis's Survey (1742 ed.), 1 i. John Gutch was urged to edit a new edition. In 1854 Thomas Duffus Hardy published at Oxford an expanded edition in three volumes, in which Le Neve's 11,051 entries were extended to 30,000. *Life of Dr Field. In 1716 Le Neve also published in London his Life of Dr. Field, Dean of Gloucester, of which he is known only to have written the preface. *Monumenta Anglicana. In 1717 he published his Monumenta Anglicana (Monumenta Anglicana, being Inscriptions on the Monuments of several eminent Persons deceased in or since the year 1700 to the end of the year 1715, deduced into a series of time by way of Annals; at the end of which year is added an Obituary of some memorable Persons who died therein, whose Inscriptions (if any yet set up) are not come to hand). He quotes largely from MSS. P. L., being the manuscript diary of Peter Le Neve, later printed in part in the Transactions of the Norfolk and Norwich Archaeological Society. Many of the inscriptions were communicated by the monumental masons who set them up. In his preface he states that he was prompted by John Weever's 'Funerall Monuments,' published in 1631. In 1718 he issued separately two more volumes, covering the periods 1650-1679 and 1680-1699. In 1718 appeared a fourth volume, covering the period 1600-49, and he announced that he was making collections of the same sort, beginning at the year 1400, but these collections were never printed. Later in that year he issued a fifth volume, containing a supplement of monuments between 1650 and 1718. *Lives and Characters. In 1720 he published in two parts The Lives and Characters ... of all the Protestant Bishops of the Church of England since the Reformation.

There is a built-up area on the B4329 former turnpike, and another down a side-road, close to, but with no road access to Llys y Fran reservoir. Name According to a pre-1850 parish map, the area on the B4329 was named Woodstock Slop, and the other just Woodstock. The Welsh name does not appear on parish or Ordnance Survey maps before the 20th century, but the Methodists were using the name in 1913. History Close to Woodstock village is Woodstock Ring, a prehistoric earthwork containing the possible traces of a building within, indicating habitation in prehistoric times. Woodstock has been described as a modern village but the manor of Woodstock (along with that of Ambleston) was bequeathed by Sir James Perrot, son of Sir John Perrot to Francis Perrot, and then in 1642 to his nephew Herbert. In 1761 Herbert's descendant Sir John Perrot sold Woodstock to Admiral Thomas Tucker. The manor is mentioned many times in respect of indentures, grants and tenancies in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1717 Woodstock mill was leased to yeoman Lewis John. Richard Fenton, in 1811, recorded passing through Woodstock, stating that the name came from an extensive manor owned in early times by Huko Hywel, whose daughters married Normans, and that the manor eventually came into the possession of the Perrott family. James Hartley Jones, whose name appears on the Ambleston War Memorial, is recorded as having enlisted at Woodstock (he lived in the nearby hamlet of Wallis) early in World War I. Chapel Fenton noted that a chapel of ease to Ambleston parish existed in the village, but had long since ceased to exist, and the cemetery had been ploughed. Woodstock C.M. Chapel Woodstock Calvinistic Methodist Chapel was founded by the Reverend Howel Davies. It was built in 1755, the first Methodist chapel in Pembrokeshire, and was rebuilt in 1809 and restored in 1890. The chapel is a Grade II listed building. School A school was opened in Woodstock in 1869 and closed in the 1960s. School records are kept by Dyfed Family History Society.

The unit was formed in May 1939. The unit operated the Dornier Do 17 light bomber, Dornier Do 217 and Junkers Ju 188 heavy bombers. During the course of the Second World War KG 2 lost 767 aircraft destroyed and 158 damaged.de Zeng et al Vol. 1 2007, p. 24. According to H.L. de Zeng at al, it suffered 1,908 personnel killed in action or missing in action and 214 as prisoners of war. Broken down further, for the duration of the war KG 2 lost 1,228 killed, 688 missing, 656 wounded and with 214 captured, for a total of 2,786 in both combat and non-combat operations.Balke 1990, pp. 524‚Äì525.

The crews converted onto Junkers Ju 86.de Zeng et al Vol. 1 2007, p. 29. The unit spent most of the summer training and recruiting personnel from the flight schools in night flying. World War II=Invasion of Poland= On 25 August the unit was transferred to Jesau and participated in the Invasion of Poland. Stab/KG 2 was withdrawn on 20 September and placed under the Command of Luftflotte 3 carrying out reconnaissance missions over France. I. 2 attacked airfields at Wilna and Lida and Plock on 1 September and again on 2 September. From 2‚Äì3 September it supported the German Third Army and German Fourth Army north of Warsaw. From 4‚Äì11 September rail targets were again bombed. Troop concentrations became the main targets after this until the end of the fighting in Poland. Stab./ KG 2 and II. 2 also operated in support of I. Gruppe. Altogether, the three Grupen had contributed 84 Dornier Do 17Z aircraft to the campaign.de Zeng et al Vol. 1 2007, p. 23, 24, 29, 31. =Battle of France and the Low Countries= I./KG 2 supported German Army Group A's crossing of the Meuse. It supported Heinz Guderian's Panzerkorps in the vicinity of Sedan during the battle of 12‚Äì14 May. It fielded 36 Dornier Do 17s, with 22 aircraft serviceable. It also hit French Air Force airfields in Amiens, Reims, Champagne and Arras. Between 21‚Äì31 May 1940, I. Gruppe supported ground forces during the Battle of Dunkirk. On 3 June 1940 it participated in the huge aerial offensive against French air power in Operation Paula. II./KG 2 committed 36 Do 17s (28 operational) to the western campaign in Fliegerkorps II. It assisted in all the major operations of the French Campaign. III./KG 2 supported the other two Gruppen with 36 Do 17s, with 30 serviceable.de Zeng et al Vol. 1 2007, p. 31. The worst day of the western campaign for KG 2 was 27 May, when Major Werner Kreipe's III. Gruppe lost 11 out of 27 Do 17s to RAF fighters over Dunkirk.Hough & Richards 2002, p. 93. =Battle of Britain= In mid-1940, I./KG 2 deployed up to 43 Do 17s (27 operational) against Britain while based at Epinoy. The Geschwader took part in the first large dogfight over the English Channel, on 10 July 1940 ‚Äì the day usually considered to be the beginning of the Battle of Britain. In an attack on Convoy \\"Bread\\", KG 2 sank two ships and one 700-ton sloop and damaged four RAF fighters. In return three Do 17s were lost and three damaged, along with three Messerschmitt Bf 110s destroyed and a single Messerschmitt Bf 109, with two damaged.Bungay 2000, p. 150. On 10 August, KG 2 attacked Convoy \\"Booty\\", losing three Dorniers and six damaged.Bungay 2000, p. 183. On 13 August (\\"Eagle Day\\"), KG 2 took off at 4:50 am led by Geschwaderkommodore Johannes Fink to attack targets in southern Britain. They were to be escorted by Bf 110s from ZG 26 led by Oberstleutnant Joachim-Friedrich Huth. The weather was poor and German ground controllers ordered the fighters back to base. The message did not get through to II. and III./KG 2. Huth tried to signal them by flying in front of them and performing aerobatics. Fink ignored him and flew on. He flew around the coast to his target: Eastchurch airfield on the Isle of Sheppey. Albert Kesselring had issued orders for bombers to abandon missions if their escorts did not show up. But some Bf 109s from Erprobungsgruppe had not received the order either and Fink failed to turn back as he was not disobeying the directive. The return would take KG 2 across No. 11 Group's territory, which would have been disastrous. Owing to the radar plotters missing the raiders, and the Observer Corps misjudging the bearing or route of the raid, the RAF failed to prevent the target being attacked. On the return journey No. 74 Squadron RAF, No. 111 Squadron RAF and No. 151 Squadron RAF managed to intercept, shooting down five Do 17s.Bungay 2000, p. 207. KG 2 claimed destroyed ten Supermarine Spitfires on the ground and wrecked the airfield.Bungay 2000, p. 208. In fact it would seem none were lost.Hough and Richards 2007, p. 157. The Geschwader also took part in heavy fighting on 18 August, known later as \\"The Hardest Day\\". By 7 September, the strength of I./KG 2 had fallen to 19 machines, with only 12 operational. II./KG 2 began operations over Britain with 35 Do 17s, 31 operational. By 7 September this had fallen to 30 and 20 respectively. III./KG 2 succeeded in replacing most of its losses; the number employed on 13 August was 34 Do 17s and 32 operational. The figures were the same on 7 September.de Zeng et al Vol. 1 2007, p. 33. The Geschwader was also in action on 15 September 1940, known later as \\"Battle of Britain Day\\". It continued to strike at targets during the Blitz, before redeploying to Austria on 28 March 1941, to prepare for operations during the German invasion of Yugoslavia. =Balkans Campaign= I. Gruppe committed 29 Do 17s with 28 operational. It participated in the bombing of Belgrade, the Battle of Greece and Battle of Crete attacking ground and naval targets. On 20 May 1941 the unit claimed many Allied ships sunk north of Crete. It reported the loss of 6 Do 17s and 7 damaged.de Zeng et al Vol. 1 2007, p. 28. II. Gruppe did not take part. III. Gruppe participated with 30 Do 17s, 29 operational. It reported losses of 6 aircraft shot down and 5 damaged during the campaign. During June 1941 I./KG 2 was partially converted to the Do 217. =Eastern Front= I. and III./KG 2 supported both Army Group North and Army Group Centre in several major engagements. 2 supported German forces during the Battle of Bia≈Çystok‚ÄìMinsk, Battle of Smolensk, Siege of Leningrad and Battle of Moscow. III./KG 2 returned to Germany on 26 September to convert onto the Do 217. I./KG 2 departed for Germany on 31 October 1941.de Zeng et al Vol. 1 2007, p. 28 & p. 33. Total losses for Kampfgeschwader 2 on the Eastern Front in 1941 indicate three Do 17s lost in June, a further nine lost in July, nine in August, a single Dornier destroyed on the ground in September, three Do 17s in October, for a total of 24 lost in aerial combat and one on the ground.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 119. I./KG 2 lost 13 Do 17s destroyed and 12 damaged in 22 June ‚Äì 31 October 1941. The Dornier's most notable action on the Eastern front occurred on 23‚Äì24 June at Grodno. The commander of the Soviet Western Front, General Dmitriy Pavlov attempted a counterattack against Hermann Hoth's Panzergruppe 3. With air superiority and no air opposition, Dornier Do 17s of III./KG 2 destroyed columns of Soviet infantry. With help from other units, the Luftwaffe destroyed 105 Soviet tanks. The Soviet 6th and 11th Mechanised Corps and 6th Cavalry Corps were routed. For his unit's particular effectiveness, Hauptmann Walter Bradel, received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross.Bergstr√∂m 2007, p. 23. =Western Europe= While I. and III./KG 2 were engaged on the Eastern Front, II./KG 2 operated from various bases in the Netherlands and France in Maritime Interdiction Operations and strategic bombing attacks on the United Kingdom. Its first notable action was its participation in Operation Donnerkeil, the Luftwaffe's air superiority plan in support of the Kriegsmarine operation Operation Cerberus (also known as the Channel Dash). In July 1941 II. Gruppe were attached to stab./KG 30 under the command of Luftflotte 3. On 2 July 1942 it could muster 37 Do 217s and 2 Do 17s. On the night of the 4/5 July 1942 it flew its first mission over the United Kingdom with Do 217s. Over the period 4 July ‚Äì 31 December 1941 the unit lost 18 Do 217s. In August 1942 the unit lost 7 Do 217s during the Dieppe raid. In November 1942 it helped German forces occupy Vichy France during Case Anton. I./KG 2 returned to western Europe in May 1942. It engaged in night attacks over Britain and dropping naval mines in the English Channel and along the British east coast. This action continued until May 1944. By that time the Gruppe had struck at ports along the southern British coast which contained the Allied invasion fleets that were to launch the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944.de Zeng et al Vol. 1 2007, pp. 28‚Äì29. II./KG 2 had supported I./KG 2 from December 1942 ‚Äì September 1943. It was withdrawn to Germany owing to \\"very heavy losses\\". During that time, the Geschwaderkommodore Walter Bradel was killed returning from a raid on Norwich on 5 May 1943. V./KG 2 was formed in mid 1943 and was the first to operate the Messerschmitt Me 410 in a night bomber and occasional night intruder role over the UK. The gruppe lost its first Me 410 on the night of 13‚Äì14 July 1943 when Fw Zwissler and his Bordfunker were killed after being shot down by future 'ace' F/L N Bunting in a Mosquito night fighter of No. 85 Squadron. II./KG 2 converted to the Junkers Ju 188 in October ‚Äì December 1943. It used its new aircraft to bomb British cities and ports containing the Allied invasion fleets. II./KG 2 continued strategic and anti-shipping strikes until, owing to lack of resources, was dissolved at Reppen on 3 October 1944. During its air raids over Britain, KG 2 lost 65 of 88 crews in April ‚Äì September 1942. On four raids (27‚Äì31 July) it lost 27 aircraft. III./KG 2 was withdrawn to Germany in July 1944 after combat operations over the Normandy beachheads. It was ordered dissolved on 16 September 1944, but it was not carried out. In October the Gruppe retrained as a night fighter unit flying the Dornier Do 335. The unit was renamed V./NJG 2 on 1 December 1944. Such training was abandoned in March 1945.de Zeng et al Vol. 1 2007, p. 34. I./KG 2 was disbanded officially on 3 October 1944 after combat operations over France.

Communibiologists take the nature side of the nature versus nurture debate in communication development. The communibiological paradigm was developed by Beatty and McCroskey as an alternative to the nature side supporting social learning paradigm. They believe genetics to be far more important in the development of communication behavior than learning processes and the environment. These researchers do concede, however, that genetic factors are not the sole source of communication behavior. One accepted ratio is 20% influence of cultural, situational, or environmental stimuli and 80% influence of inborn, neurobiological structures on behavior. A main idea of communibiology is that temperaments are based on genetics and not learned. Communication behavior is an expression of a person's temperament, though the behavior and the temperament do not completely correlate with one another. Identical genetics producing identical temperaments may result in non- identical communication behaviors because one's temperament can be expressed in various ways. The behaviors, though, will be very similar. Influences on the communibiological paradigm=Hans Eysenck's personality theory= Hans Eysenck found that the two main aspects of personality are temperament and intelligence. He identified three personality types: *Extraversion ‚Äìsociable, lively, active, assertive, sensation-seeking, carefree dominant, surgent and venturesome. *Neuroticism ‚Äì anxious, depressed, guilt feelings, low self- esteem, tense, irrational, shy, moody emotional. *Psychoticism ‚Äì aggressive, cold, ego-centric, impersonal, impulsive, antisocial, unempathic, creative, and tough-minded. Eysenck argues that these three personalities are inherited lending it useful to the communibiological paradigm. Other research has also found that the genetic component of these three personalities is between 50% and 80%. =J.A. Gray's theory of neuropsychology of temperament= J.A. Gray proposed a behavioral inhibition system (BIS) and a behavioral activation system (BAS). The threshold for activation of the BIS or BAS is inherited. =Cary Horvath's twins study= Horvath compared identical and fraternal twins in order to determine if communicator styles were inherited. This was the first study of heredity and communication and it found that communicator style variables are partially inherited, leading the way for the future studies regarding inheritance and communication behavior. Model for communibiological research (as used by Beatty, et al.) #Select or create a theory that proposes an explanation for an aspect of human communication behavior. #Relate the theory to specific biological elements or processes. #Select or create a measure related to those biological elements or processes. #Establish a relationship between the measurements, human communication behavior, and biological elements or processes. Opponents There exist many opponents to the communibiological paradigm. First are the \\"nurture\\" and social learning paradigm supporters that believe learning has more to do with communication behavior than genetics. Then there are others who believe the whole argument is pointless. Condit calls for a multi-causal model that would incorporate both nature and nurture. Condit also claims that the 80% genetic influence found by Beatty and McCroskey lacks solid evidence and a number in the 40-60% range is more likely, helping to support her view of incorporating both nature and nurture. Communibiological perspective on communication apprehension Communication apprehension afflicts millions of people worldwide. Much of the communibiological research done on communication apprehension has found that the causes of the affliction are inherited.Ireland, C. (2016). Student oral presentations: developing the skills and reducing the apprehension. In: Proceedings of 10th International Technology, Education and Development Conference Valencia, Spain. 7-9 March, 2016. IATED (2016). IATED, Valencia, Spain, pp. 1474-1483. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/297715071_Student_oral_presentations_developing_the_skills_and_reducing_the_apprehension =Beatty and McCroskey= Beatty and McCroskey first developed their communibiological paradigm in order to more effectively diagnose communication apprehension. Using Eysenck's personality theory they identified the primary components of communication apprehension to be introversion and neuroticism. They also used Gray's theory to say that activation of the behavioral inhibition system is related to anxiety. They make note that both the personalities of Eysenck's theory and the activation threshold of the BIS in Gray's theory have been found to be inherited. Differences in communication apprehension correspond to differences in BIS activation threshold, supporting the idea that communication apprehension is genetically determined. =Interpersonal communication motives= Interpersonal communication motives explain why people with communication apprehension communicate the way they do. People with low communication apprehension communicate for pleasure, affection, control, and relaxation while people with high communication apprehension communicate for inclusion and escape. Paulsel and Mottet (2004) found that interpersonal communication motives such as these are at least a partially influenced by genetically inherited traits. =Communication apprehension in second languages= Jung and McCroskey (2004) studied the presence of communication apprehension in those speaking their first language and those speaking their second language. Communication apprehension in the first language predicted communication apprehension in the second language. This combated the social learning perspective which would say that the learning of the second language would influence and change the communication apprehension in the second language. They concluded that communication apprehension is a cross-linguistic trait and that the trait is genetically inherited. =Treatment= The fact that the causes of communication apprehension are inherited has major implications in how it can be treated as some believe that if communication apprehension is genetically inherited then it cannot be changed. Others contend, as Beatty and McCroskey did, that since traits are not exclusively genetically inherited, treatment is viable. Treatment in terms of the communibiological paradigm involves learning to control the negative aspects of one's inherited temperament. The role of culture Comminubiologists argue that people are born with specific temperaments based on their genetics. This does not, however, mean that they do not learn. Culture plays an important role in this learning process. While they are born with a certain temperament a person learns how to respond to specific temperamental demands based on the culture they are surrounded by. As children they learn which temperamental actions are appropriate and which are not. So while the basis of a person's communication behavior is based on genetics, a good portion of their behavior is also affected by the culture they are raised in. In fact, the communication behaviors ethnocentrism and homophobia were found to have no relationship with a person's genetic make-up or temperament. These traits are instead developed through culture.

According to the Handbook of Texas, the community had an estimated population of 639 in 2000. It is part of the Sherman-Denison Metropolitan Statistical Area. Geography Luella is located along State Highway 11 in central Grayson County, approximately four miles southeast of Sherman. History=Early years= Luella's history dates back to the 1880s. In 1888, the tracks of the St. Louis Southwestern Railway reached the area. Businessman J.L. Hughes built a general merchandise store combined with a railroad station. He applied for and established a post office branch under the name Luella, after his oldest daughter. Soon after, Luella boasted a number of businesses as well as a public school that also functioned as a community center. Besides freight, the railroad ‚Äì also known as the Cotton Belt Line, ran a daily passenger trolley from Sherman (through Luella) to Commerce and back. By 1914, the community was home to around fifty people. Luella remained small and went into decline in the 1920s. The post office closed in 1924 and train service was discontinued in the early 1950s. Grayson County purchased the railroad right-of-way and the dirt lane next to the tracks became Farm to Market Road 1281. =Revitalization= In 1964, the Luella Water Supply District was created by fifty area residents who each contributed $50 to the project. This infrastructure improvement revived the once declining community and its status as a lightly populated area near Sherman made the area attractive to developers. Four subdivisions ‚Äì Luella Heights, Chamberlain Ridge, Golden Acres, and Highland Meadows, were constructed in the Luella area during the 1970s. Each subdivision offered country-style living and homes on large lots. =Incorporation= Although Luella was an unincorporated community, it was located in Sherman's Extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ). After Sherman began drilling several wells in the Luella area, rumors of an impending annexation spread throughout the community. There were fears that annexation into the city would not bring the level of city serves to Luella that were enjoyed by other Sherman residents. A movement to incorporate Luella was initiated and on April 11, 1978, an election was held to determine the community's future status. Of the 99 votes cast, 89 were cast in favor of incorporation. Residents also elected a mayor, J.C. Rich, and a five-member town council. In the 1980 census, Luella's population was 371. After incorporation, the town government was able to provide basic services, such as road maintenance. As the years passed, however, the funds needed to properly run Luella weren't sufficient and road conditions in the town declined. The lack of funds came to a head when school bus drivers who carried students from Luella to Tom Bean refused to cross Watkins Road Bridge due to its poor condition. When heavy rains fell, it swelled the waters of Cedar Creek and flooded the bridge. School district officials knew that if it rained during the day, it would be impossible to return the children to their homes without detouring a long way around. Negotiations with the county to replace the bridge were unsuccessful. A grant from the state looked like a better deal, with an eighty-twenty percent split. But the construction costs ran over, and delays stretched the timetable far beyond its projected end. By the time it was finished, Luella was close to bankruptcy, and there were other bridges needing repair. Mayor Dolores Bernhardt introduced a proposed tax increase that would have provided the necessary funding to maintain the roads, but it didn't guarantee any other services. =Disincorporation= On May 1, 1993, 213 of the 312 registered voters in Luella turned out to again determine the future status of their town. 128 people (60.1%) voted in favor of ending Luella's fifteen-year status as an incorporated community, while 85 (39.9%) wanted to remain incorporated. Today, the former town exists as an unincorporated, bedroom community for nearby Sherman. Luella had an estimated population of 639 in 2000. The Luella Special Utility District provides water service to approximately 1,000 homes in the area. Education Public education in the community of Luella is provided by the Tom Bean Independent School District . Zoned campuses include Tom Bean Elementary School (grades K-5), Tom Bean Middle School (grades 6-8), and Tom Bean High School (grades 9-12).

It is produced by the French company Bookeen. Description The Cybook Opus is an ultra-light reading device based on E Ink screen technology. The device is 4.2‚Ä≥ x 6‚Ä≥ x 0.4‚Ä≥ inches and weighs 5.3 oz (150g), battery included. It features E Ink electronic ink with a 200 dpi display which is enough for text, although not enough for high quality images. Its screen possesses a paper-like high contrast appearance and is readable under direct sunlight. It is not the best E-Ink screen available, as it supports only 4 shades of gray compared with the 8 or 16 shades on some other readers. =Controls= The control system include: -two long buttons to the right of the screen (in standard portrait mode) to handle page navigation. Side buttons can be flipped (‚ÄúAdvanced‚Ä¶‚Äù menu), allowing one hand page turns with thumb on lower button (portrait modes only). -a four-way navigation wheel with a button at its centre below the screen, which is primarily used for navigating the menu system but can also be used for page navigation. The menu is activated by a dedicated button, and then there's a back button to return to the previous option or screen. It has an accelerometer that allows it to switch from portrait to landscape mode automatically (if the option is enabled), which will appeal equally to left and right-handed readers. All the controls change to match the orientation, and behave as a user would expect - whichever page button is \\"top\\" or \\"right\\" will go to the next page, and the \\"bottom\\" or \\"left\\" button will go to the previous page, no matter which way around you hold the Opus. While reading and also in the ‚ÄúLibrary‚Äù, keeping next/previous page button pressed will enter the fast pagination mode. =Battery and power= It has a Lithium Polymer (Li-Polymer) rechargeable (and replaceable, unlike other devices) battery, with a battery lifetime of 8,000 page flips. The page flips are the only thing that consumes battery. To charge the device, you use the same included USB cable that you use for transferring content to it (either via free Adobe Digital Editions software or by dragging and dropping to storage). It takes 5 hours for a full charge. =Storage, copying and organizing the library= To a host computer the Cybook functions as a typical USB mass storage device. The user can categorize your books into folders and subfolders for easy access. It stores up to 1,000 titles in 1GB of built in flash memory. A Micro Secure Digital card slot allows for expanded storage, which does support SDHC cards for up to 32GB more storage space. =Formats supported= The device uses TrueType fonts (TTF), and can also be used as an image viewer. Text formats : Adobe ePub / PDF (native or DRM- protected), TXT, FictionBook (.fb2) and HTML files without any conversions. One has to choose between ePub or Mobi (due to Amazon contract restrictions), but you can swap Mobi and ePUB firmware as often as you wish (and as sensible). Conversions from all formats can be done with 3rd party software such as Calibre. Image formats (black and white): JPEG, GIF and PNG The Cybook technically supports PDF files, however it doesn't actually reflow text. Current firmware revisions support ten levels of zoom and allow scrolling around the page, making the device suitable for reading many PDF files. =Fonts and text display= 12 font sizes, from very small to very large (works with ePub, HTML, FB2, TXT). You can add your own fonts. Create a folder called \\"Fonts\\" (the name is case sensitive) under the \\"CyBook\\" USB drive and add your TrueType or OpenType fonts to it (works with ePub, HTML, FB2, TXT). Layout can be switched between justified and left-aligned text (works with ePub, HTML, FB2, TXT). Text emboldening: allows setting text in bold for maximized contrast (works with ePub, HTML, FB2, TXT). =Operating system and firmware= The Cybook Opus runs Linux as its underlying operating system; however, the firmware is open source but not the application. This could be due to the support for DRM protected e-books, which probably require third party libraries. June 2010 Bookeen published a much improved firmware. This new firmware, (V2.1 build 1198) brings the 1 second mode: Cybook can be switched on/off in 1 second, keeping last read page open -this allows you to switch on and off without having to boot each time. See the .pdf readme file User interface is available in a total of 23 languages. =Pros and cons of its features= As it lacks a keyboard, it does not have dictionary support, annotations and bookmarks. It also does not have Wi-Fi access, text-to-speech support nor the possibility of listening to music while reading. It is meant only for reading, like a physical book. The main concern was to make it small and lightweight, so that one can read for hours without discomfort. It uses open formats and standards so it would not lock the user into one company's products in future.

Its northern edge is south of Pembroke and its southern edge reaches the sea at Flimston Bay. It is bordered by Castlemartin to the west, St Twynnells to the east and Monkton to the north. History Warren was a parish in the hundred of Castlemartin, which in pre-Norman times was part of the Cantref of Penfro in the Kingdom of Dyfed. A prominent ridge in the northern part of the parish is crossed by a ridgeway that may be of prehistoric origin. The origin of the name is obscure, but there is a Warren Farm (a listed building)) and an ancient fortification (a scheduled monument) close by. A 1578 map in the British Library shows the parish as Waren. Merrion Court is a Grade II listed building in the east of the parish, a 19th century structure built on 18th century ruins. Richard Fenton, in 1811, described the house as a ruin, previously a manor belonging to Lord Cawdor. Merrion Court's Granary Range and Mill are also Grade II listed. Another listed building in the parish is an 18th or early 19th cottage (originally two or three) called Cold Comfort. Since 1801, the population (then 160) has been sparse and scattered in this agricultural landscape, and fell in most subsequent decades, to a low of 86 in 1961. The number of houses in the parish halved between 1831 and 1961. The religious census of 1851 described the parish as \\"‚Ä¶a small Parish consisting of Three Farms only with a few cottages tenanted by poor Labourers and families who are mostly Dissenters or Independents whose place of Worship is situated in a Neighbouring Parish although they occasionally attend the Church\\". The 1872 Imperial Gazetteer gives the parish area as and a population of 121 in 18 houses, all in one estate. From 1939 to 1948, the Castlemartin Training Area was establishedits main base is at Merrionabsorbing most of Warren parish. St Mary's Church The former parish church of St Mary is located in a prominent position on a ridge and is thought to date from the 13th century. It consists of a nave a with a south transept, and a tower topped by a stone spire. The north aisle was removed in 1770. The church was restored in 1855 to designs by Abraham Leach, when a new chancel, chancel arch and south transept arch were added, and the windows were replaced. The church is a Grade II* listed building. The original wooden spire was replaced with a stone spire in about 1870 with help from the Admiralty. War with France was anticipated, and the Admiralty wanted the church tower to serve as a landmark for shipping. The churchyard cross was installed in 1925 on a much older three-stepped stone base, which may be medieval. In a poor state of repair, the church was closed by the Diocese of St Davids in 1970. In 1986 it was decided to use the church as a interdenominational place of worship for British and German troops at the Castlemartin Training Area, and the church was restored. It was reopened by the Archbishop of Wales in 1988, in the presence of Anglican, Roman Catholic and German Lutheran clergy.

The operating system kernel of OS 2200 is a lineal descendant of Exec 8 for the UNIVAC 1108. Documentation and other information on current and past Unisys systems can be found on the Unisys public support website.Current Unisys documentation is available on the Unisys public support web site. For OS 2200 products, select one of the ClearPath Dorado platforms (e.g., Dorado 800 or Dorado 8300) and then the release level (usually the highest numbered one unless you are looking for something specific in an earlier release). That will take you to a search page where you can search by title or document content. See Unisys 2200 Series system architecture for a description of the machine architecture and its relationship to the OS 2200 operating system.  History  There were earlier 1100 systems going back to the 1101 in 1951, but the 1108 was the first 1100 Series computer designed for efficient support of multiprogramming and multiprocessing. Along with this new hardware came the operating system Exec 8 (Executive System for the 1108). The UNIVAC 1108 computer was announced in 1964 and delivered in late 1965. The first 1108 computers used Exec I and Exec II, which had been developed for the UNIVAC 1107. However, UNIVAC planned to offer symmetric multiprocessor versions of the 1108 with up to 4 processors and the earlier operating systems (really basic monitor programs) weren't designed for that, even though they supported limited multiprogramming. Genealogy of software When the UNIVAC 1110 was introduced in 1972, the operating system name was changed to OS 1100 to reflect its support for the wider range of systems. The name OS 1100 was retained until 1988 with the introduction of the Sperry 2200 Series as a follow on to the 1100 Series when its name was changed to OS 2200. Since that time, the 2200 Series became the Unisys ClearPath IX Series and then the Unisys ClearPath Dorado Series, but the operating system retained the OS 2200 name. The company name and its product names also changed over time. Engineering Research Associates (ERA) of Saint Paul was acquired by Remington Rand Corporation. Remington Rand also acquired the Eckert‚ÄìMauchly Computer Corporation of Philadelphia which was then building the UNIVAC computer. The two were combined into the UNIVAC division of Remington Rand under the direction of William Norris. William Norris had been one of the founders of ERA and later left Remington Rand to start Control Data Corporation. The UNIVAC division of Remington Rand Corporation became the UNIVAC division of Sperry Rand Corporation after Remington Rand merged with Sperry Corporation. In the 1970s Sperry Rand began a corporate identity program that changed its name to Sperry Corporation and all the division names to begin with Sperry, so the computer systems division became Sperry UNIVAC. Later the division names were dropped and everything simply became Sperry. The operating system kernel is still referred to as \\"the Exec\\" by most Unisys and customer personnel. However, when Unisys began releasing suites of products tested together as system base releases, later called \\"ClearPath OS 2200 Release n\\", the term OS 2200 changed to refer to the entire suite of products in the system release and others, such as BIS, released asynchronously for the Dorado hardware platforms. In 1986 Burroughs and Sperry corporations merged to become Unisys (which some long time 2200 Series clients say stands for \\"UNIVAC Is Still Your Supplier\\"). The major mainframe product lines of both companies have continued in development including the MCP Operating System from Burroughs and OS 2200 from Sperry. In 2016 Unisys made a virtual Microsoft Windows version of OS2200 available at no cost for educational and leisure purposes. = Exec 8 = EXEC 8 (sometimes referred to as EXEC VIII) was UNIVAC's operating system developed for the UNIVAC 1108 in 1964. It combined the best features of the earlier operating systems, EXEC I and EXEC II, which were used on the UNIVAC 1107. EXEC 8 was one of the first commercially successful multiprocessing operating systems. It supported simultaneous mixed workloads comprising batch, time- sharing and real-time. Its one file system had a flat naming structure across many drums and spindles. It also supported a well-received transaction processing system. Previous systems were all real-mode systems with no hardware support for protection and separation of programs and the operating system. While there had been support for multiprogramming in previous systems, it was limited to running one user job concurrently with multiple supporting functions known to be well-behaved, such as the card reader, printer, and card punch spoolers. The Exec 8 operating system was designed from the very beginning to be a multiprogramming and multiprocessing operating system because the 1108 was designed to have up to four CPUs. Memory and mass storage were the primary system constraints. While the 1100 Series was envisioned as targeting a more general market, extreme real time processing was a primary requirement. The specifications for Exec 8 were drawn up by December 1964 as a preliminary Programmers Reference Manual (user guide) and work began in May 1965..Gray, George T. & Smith, Ronald Q.(2008). _Unisys Computers: An Introductory History_. New Jersey, Lulu (www.lulu.com/content/2735927). Exec 8 began as a real time operating system with early use mostly in general scientific and engineering work, but it was also used in message switching, process control, simulation, and missile firing control. It was designed to run on systems that often had only 128K words (576 K bytes‚Äîless than the maximum memory size for the IBM PC XT), and was focused on real time and batch processing. While the earliest release levels did work in 128KW, increasing functionality in later releases made that untenable, since it didn't leave enough space for programs of useful size. The maximum memory capacity of an 1108 was 256KW (1,148 KB) so efficient use of memory was the most important constraint since core memory was the most expensive part of the system. Mass storage consisted of 6-foot long rotating drums that held 256KW (in the FH-432) to 2MW (in the FH-1782). The highest capacity mass storage was the FASTRAND drum, which held 22 MW (99 MB). File fragmentation was dealt with by a process called a \\"file save\\", which was generally done once per day, at night. It involved rolling all files out to tape, reinitializing the drum file system, then reading the files back in. With severe memory constraints and real time use, keeping only a single copy of code loaded into core was a requirement. Since the 1108 was designed for multitasking, the system was fully \\"reentrant\\" (thread safe). Each reentrant module accessed program data through a single memory \\"base address\\", which was different for each instance of run data. Switching execution contexts could be done in a single instruction merely by setting a different base address in a single register. The system used fine-grained locking to protect shared data structures. The executive, compilers, utilities, and even sophisticated user applications that might have multiple copies running concurrently were written so that their code could be shared. This required loading only one copy into memory, saving both space and the time it took to load the code. Another reason to separate code and data into different load entities was that memory was implemented as two independent banks (separate physical cabinets) called IBANK and DBANK (instruction and data). Each had its own access path, so the CPU could read both banks simultaneously. By loading executable code into one memory bank and data into the other, the run time of many programs could be almost halved. Reentrant code had to be thread safe (execute only); self-modifying code was not allowed. For other programs, modifying executable code during runtime was still an acceptable programming technique in the time of 1100-series computers, but users were encouraged not to do it because of the performance hit. Security benefits were touted but not highly valued because hacking most 1100-series applications would provide no benefit to anyone, and because few hackers were malevolent then. Exec 8 was primarily a batch processing system that gave applications (called \\"tasks\\") very fine control of CPU scheduling priority for its threads (called \\"activities\\"). Processor switching was preemptive, with higher priority threads gaining control of the processor currently running the lowest priority thread of any program. Except in realtime systems, even the lowest priority tasks got some processor time. It was a multiprogramming and multiprocessing operating system with fully symmetric processor management. A test-and-set instruction built into the hardware allowed very efficient and fine-grained locking both within the OS and within multi-threaded applications. In Exec 8, work is organized into jobs, called \\"runs,\\" which are scheduled based on their priority and need for lockable resources such as Uniservo tape drives or Fastrand drum files. The control language syntax uses the \\"@\\" symbol (which Univac called \\"the master space\\") as the control statement recognition symbol. It was immediately followed by the command or program name, then a comma and any option switches. After a space character, the remainder of the statement differed for particular commands. A command to compile a FORTRAN program would look like \\"@FOR[,options] sourcefile, objectfile\\". Input data for an application could be read from a file (generally card images), or immediately follow the @ command in the run stream. All lines until the sentinel command \\"@END\\" were assumed to be input data, so forgetting to insert it led to the compiler interpreting subsequent commands as program data. For this reason, it was preferable to process data in files rather than inputting it in the run stream. In 1968, work began on adding time-sharing capability to Exec 8. It was delivered with level 23 of the executive in 1969. Time sharing (called demand mode) had the same capabilities as batch and real time processes. Everything that could be done in batch could be done from an ASCII terminal. In demand mode, job stream I/O was attached to a terminal handler rather than card image (input) and spool (output) files. The same run control language was used for both. A few years later, more specific time sharing commands were added, and some control statements could be issued asynchronously for immediate processing, even when neither the executive or the running program were expecting data. Those commands, which could be entered only from a terminal, began with \\"@@\\". Because they could be performed without stopping other work in progress from the same terminal, they were called transparent commands. At first these were just statements to kill the current program or redirect terminal output to a file, but eventually, almost all control statements were allowed to be \\"immediate.\\" Both batch and demand runs terminate with an @FIN statement, and if a demand user terminates his session while his run is active, the Exec automatically terminates the run without requiring @FIN. = Communications software = A transaction processing capability was developed in the late 1960s as a joint project with United Airlines and later refined in another joint project with Air Canada. This capability was fully integrated into the operating system in 1972 and became the basis of much of the future growth of the 1100 Series. Early users controlled communication lines directly from within their real time programs. Part of the development of transaction processing included a communication message system that managed the communication lines and presented messages to Exec 8 to be scheduled as transactions. This moved all the low level communication physical line management and protocols out of the applications and into the CMS 1100 application. CMS 1100 itself ran as a real time multi- threaded program with the privilege of acquiring control of communication lines and submitting transaction messages for scheduling. This led to the notions in Exec 8 that applications of any nature needed to be carefully controlled to ensure that they could not cause integrity issues. Security was certainly a concern, but in the early days system reliability and integrity were much larger issues. The system was still primarily batch and transaction processing and there was little chance that anyone could install unauthorized code on the system. CMS 1100 later added the capability to be the interface for demand terminals as well as transaction terminals so that terminals could be used for both and the early terminal drivers could be removed from the Exec. CMS 1100 was later replaced by a combination of CPComm (ClearPath Enterprise Servers Communications Platform) and SILAS (System Interface for Legacy Application Systems). For the Intel-based Dorado server models, the lower level communications were moved to firmware, with the upper levels handled by SILAS and CPCommOS (ClearPath Enterprise Servers Communications Platform for Open Systems). = The Exec = The Exec contains all the code in the system that is allowed to run at the highest privilege levels. There are no mechanisms for other code to be promoted to those privilege levels. The Exec is responsible for managing the system hardware, scheduling and managing work, and communicating with operators and administrators. In Release 16.0, the Exec is level 49R2 (49.70.5). The internal system levels use a three-part number such as 21.92.42 (which was the first widely used production system although earlier releases were used in production at a number of sites). The first number part is the major level and indicates a new version of the Exec with all previous updates integrated into a new base version. This is an infrequent process and occurs at intervals of years. The second number part indicates versions of updates to the major level and often occurs several times per week. When a decision is made to freeze the feature content and prepare for release, the third part comes into play and indicates versions of the pre-release level as fixes and minor feature updates are applied. Concurrently with preparing a level for release, updates to the \\"mainline\\" continue as engineers integrate changes in preparation for a future release. For many years the official release level was the full three-part number. Later releases were named simply 44R1, 44R2, 49R2, and so on although the three-part number is still used internally.  Performing work  The Exec is at heart a real time, multi-threaded batch processing system. Everything has been built around that model. The Exec itself is largely structured as a real time program. Functions that are performed as Services in Windows or Daemons in Linux and UNIX are implemented as either activities within the Exec or as batch programs that are always running in the background. Time-sharing (known as demand mode) and transaction processing are implemented as special cases of batch. One result is that there are few restrictions on what a time- sharing user or transaction program can do. There are lots of warnings for writers of transaction programs that they will not be happy with performance if for example they call for a tape mount, but it is permitted. The largest unit of work is the \\"Run.\\" This is taken from the factory \\"production run\\" terminology and generally equates to job or session on other systems. A Run is defined by its \\"run stream.\\" A run stream is a sequence of control statements that represent the steps to be taken. They may include file handling, program execution, and branches of control. A batch Run is typically stored as a file and is scheduled by a \\"Start\\" command from within another Run or by the operator. A time sharing Run is initiated by logging in from a time-sharing terminal and inputting the @RUN command. Often the @RUN statement and the second control statement (often @ADD or a program execution) are generated automatically based on the user profile. Security authorizations are validated based on the authenticated user-id and other information supplied on the Run control statement. Transactions are a special case. There aren‚Äôt actually any control statements, but the internal data structures of a run are created. This enables the Exec to associate the same security, accounting, debugging, etc. mechanisms with transaction programs. Generally a security profile is cached in memory at the time the transaction user is authenticated and is copied from the user's session data to the transaction run state when the transaction is scheduled. Because each transaction instance is essentially a Run, accounting, logging, and error handling are all encapsulated by the Run mechanism. = Batch = Batch jobs (Runs) are characterized by having a runstream (job control language statements) stored in a file. A batch job always contains an @RUN statement as the first record in the file. This statement gives the run a name (runid), defines priorities, and defines the maximum number of SUPS (Standard Units of Processing) the job is expected to use. The job is started from some other job with a @START control statement or by the operator via an ST keyin. The system may be configured to automatically issue @START statements for any number of jobs when it boots. These jobs serve the purpose of performing initialization, recovery, and background functions. All of the fields on the @RUN statement may be overridden by corresponding fields on the @START statement. Except when the @START is executed by a privileged user, the userid and other security state are always taken from the run doing the @START. There are two priority fields on the @RUN statement. One is used to specify the backlog priority. There are 26 backlog priority levels (A ‚Äì Z). The Exec has a configured maximum number of open batch runs. When that level is reached, jobs are then selected from the backlog queues in priority order. Within a priority selection is usually FIFO. However, the Exec pre-scans the job control statements up to the first program execution looking for file names and reel numbers. If the job would immediately stall because some resources it needs are not available, it may be bypassed to start other jobs at the same priority level. The second priority level defines an execution processor resource group. In general higher execution group priorities typically get more processor time. While the OS 2200 job control language does not support full programmability, it does allow dynamic additions of sequences of control language through an @ADD control statement. The file to be added may have been created by the same job immediately preceding adding it. The @ADD and most other control statements may also be submitted from within a running program via an API. Additional programmability is available indirectly through the use of the Symbolic Stream Generator (SSG). SSG is a programming language for manipulating and creating text files from input parameters and system information. It is used heavily for configuration management (make) processing and other functions where text images need to be created programmatically. The resulting output can be \\"@ADD\\"ed in the same run thus providing the indirectly programmable runstream. Operator commands are available to change both the backlog and execution priorities of runs. As all operator commands are available by API to suitably privileged users, this can be automated or controlled by a remote administrator. Deadline is a special case of batch. A deadline run looks just like any other batch run except that a deadline time is specified on the @RUN or @START control statement. The deadline time is used in conjunction with the maximum SUPS (time estimate) on the control statement. A deadline job runs at normal batch priorities unless or until it appears that it could miss its deadline time. Then the more the mismatch between time until the deadline and remaining SUPS, the higher the priority. While deadline can‚Äôt totally shut off transactions and has no effect on real time, it can effectively shut off most other processing in the system if necessary to achieve its goal. = Demand = OS 2200 time-sharing sessions are called demand (from \\"on demand\\") runs. They use the same control language as batch runs with a few additions known as \\"immediate\\" control statements. Immediate control statements use the \\"@@\\" sentinel which indicates that they are to be executed immediately even if a program is running. While they can be used to create or assign files, the most important ones allow a demand user to error terminate a running program or even send it a signal. = Transactions = Transaction processing diagram Transactions execute as runs but without any stored or submitted control statements. Instead when a message is received from a session defined as a transaction session, it is scanned to determine the transaction queue on which it is to be placed. This is normally determined by the first characters of the message but user-written scanners may be added. The communication manager, which is capable of handling up to 250,000 active sessions, takes incoming transaction messages and passes them to the message queuing software. It can handle an unlimited number of queued messages using the message queuing architecture. A call is made to the Transaction Interface Package (TIP) APIs in the operating system to queue the transaction on the appropriate queuing point. Each queuing point identifies the priority and concurrency level of the work and the associated transaction program to be executed. Transaction scheduling diagram A transaction program scheduling tree allows the client to establish relative usage for groups of transaction programs. Concurrency limits avoid one type of work dominating the system to the exclusion of other work and avoid creating an over commitment of resources. Up to 4094 nodes may be created in the tree. * Maximum concurrency specified for each node in the tree * Concurrency of higher node limits total concurrency of dependent nodes * Concurrency of highest node limits system concurrency Priority (0 to 63) and concurrency level (1 to 2047) can be specified for each transaction program. The highest priority transaction is selected for scheduling except as limited by the concurrency policies in effect for its node and higher nodes. = Real time = Real time is not another type of run. Rather it is a set of priority levels which any activity may request. Real time is most typically used by long running batch programs, like the OS 2200 communications manager CPComm, but is not restricted to such. There are 36 real time priority levels available by API for applications to use. The user and account must have the privilege to use real time priorities. It is up to the site to control how their applications use the priority levels. Real time priorities totally dominate all lower priorities so it's quite possible for a misbehaved real time program to tie up one or more processors. The real time priority applies to an individual activity (thread) so a program may have both real time and non-real time threads executing at the same time. = CPU dispatch = Once a run has been started, getting access to the processor controls its rate of progress. The heart of the Exec is the Dispatcher which manages all the processors. Dispatching priorities diagram The Exec supports up to 4095 dispatching priorities although most sites define only a small subset of those. The two highest \\"priorities\\" aren‚Äôt switchable. They are recognition of certain types of processing that must be allowed to continue on the processor on which they started until they voluntarily give up control. Interrupt lockout occurs when an interrupt arrives or in a few special cases when other Exec code prevents all interrupts (in order to change some data that an interrupt handler may also access). Interlock is used by interrupt post processing routines that either need to run on the same physical processor or simply should not be interrupted. The Dispatcher, I/O completions, and I/O initiation are some examples. All locks used by both of these priorities are spin locks as the only way they can be set by someone else is on another processor and the design requires that they only be set for very short instruction sequences. High Exec priority is used by the operator command handler and some other functions that may have to run even when a real time program has control. They are expected to use only very short amounts of time. If they need more time, they should queue the work to be processed by a Low Exec activity. Real time activities have an unlimited processor quantum and run without switching unless interrupted by a higher priority real time activity or High Exec activity. Real Time activities are given control of any available processor that is running something of lower priority. Interrupts are sent between processors when necessary to ensure immediate availability. Real time is used by customers to fly missiles, run simulators, and other functions that require immediate response. Transaction priorities may be handled in two ways as defined by the site. They may be a sort of lower priority real time in that only the priority matters and the quantum size is essentially infinite. This is appropriate for very short-lived transactions such as airline reservations; if one loops due to a programming error, the Exec will terminate it when it reaches its very small configured maximum time. The other form allows the Exec to vary the priority within a range to optimize system resource usage. The approach gives higher priority and shorter time slices to programs that are I/O limited and progressively lower priorities but longer time slices to those that are computing. The Exec dynamically adjusts these priorities based on behavior as programs often behave both ways at different times. This approach is appropriate for longer running transactions like database queries or airline fare quotes. Batch and demand always use dynamically adjusted priorities. Programs that are I/O limited or are in a conversation with a time-sharing user get higher priorities but short time slices. More compute-oriented programs get lower priorities and longer time slices. The Exec has two additional mechanisms for optimizing dispatching. One is affinity-based dispatching. When possible the Exec will run an activity on the same processor that it was on the last time to get the greatest advantage of residual cache contents. If that isn't possible it tries to keep the activity on the \\"nearest\\" processor from the standpoint of cache and memory access times. The second is a \\"fairness\\" policy mechanism. The site can define the relative percentage of resources to be allocated to each of transactions, demand and batch. Within transactions and batch there are priority groupings that can further indicate what percentage of their group's time is to be allocated to the priority. This ensures that transactions cannot so dominate the system that no batch work gets done. Within the various priority groupings it ensures that some progress can be assured for each group (unless the group percentage is zero). These \\"fairness\\" algorithms only come into play when the processors are very busy, but OS 2200 systems often run with all processors at near 100% utilized. = Metering = OS 2200 supports several models for system performance management. Customers may purchase a certain fixed performance level, and the Exec will monitor processor usage to ensure that performance does not exceed that level. Customers can also purchase additional performance either temporarily or permanently up to the full capacity of the system if their workload increases or an emergency requires it. More recently the system has added a metered usage capability. In this mode the full power of the system is always available to the customer (although they may administratively limit that). The usage is accumulated over a month and then the reported usage is submitted to Unisys billing. Depending on the specific contract terms the client may receive a bill for excess usage above some contracted baseline for the month or just a statement showing that the total contracted usage has been decremented. The first form is like a cell phone bill with the potential for charging for excess minutes. The latter is like buying a pre-paid phone card. = File system = OS 2200 does not have a hierarchical file system as do most other operating systems. Rather it has a structured naming convention and the notion of container files called program files. Files in OS 2200 are simply containers that may be addressed either by word offset in the file or by sector (28-word unit) offset in the file. The 28 words is a historical unit from an early mass storage device (the FASTRAND drum) that could hold 64 such units per physical track. Nonetheless, it is a fortunate historical accident. Four such 28-word units or 112 words occupy 504 bytes. With today's mass storage devices all using 512-byte physical records, OS 2200 clients have almost all adopted some multiple of 112 words as their physical record size and database page size. I/O processors automatically adjust for the 504<->512 byte mapping adding 8 bytes of zeros on writes and stripping them off on reads of each physical record. OS 2200 handles applications that use sizes other than multiples of 112 words by indivisibly reading the containing physical records and writing back out the unchanged and changed portions with data chaining. Special locking functions guarantee indivisibility even when there are device errors and across multiple systems in a cluster. File formats and other internal data structures are described in the _Data Structures Programming Reference Manual_.  File names  Ever since Exec-8, file names have taken the form: Qualifier*Filename(f-cycle) (e.g., \\"PERSONNEL*EMPLOYEES(+1)\\"). Qualifier and filename are simply twelve- character strings used to create whatever naming structure the client desires. F-cycle is a number from 0 to 999 that allows multiple generations of a file. These may be referenced by relative numbers: (+1) next or new cycle, (-1) previous cycle, (+0) current cycle. Leaving the cycle off defaults to the current cycle. Batch production runs that create new generations of files use this approach. The numbers wrap around after 999. Only 32 consecutive relative cycle numbers may exist at one time. Creating a (+1) deletes (-31). Any file may be used as a program file. A program file contains elements which generally act as files. Element naming is Qualifier*Filename(f-cycle).Element/version(e-cycle) (e.g., \\"PERSONNEL*PROGRAMS.TAXCALC/2008\\"). Element and version are twelve-character names used in any way a user desires. E-cycle is similar to f-cycle in that it represents a generation number but without the restriction to 32 concurrent cycles and the limit is 256K cycles. However, e-cycle only applies to text elements and each line in a text element is marked with the cycle numbers at which it was inserted and deleted. Elements also have a type and sub-type. The most commonly used types are \\"text\\" and \\"object.\\" If the default type is not suitable, options select the appropriate type. Text elements also have sub- types that typically represent the programming language (e.g., \\"ASM\\", \\"C\\", \\"COB\\", \\"FOR\\"). The default element name of an object file is the same as the text file from which it was created. An object element may be executed if it is a main program or linked with other object elements including a main program. The linking may be static or dynamic. A main program may be executed without pre-linking provided all required sub-programs are in the same program file, are system libraries, or are otherwise known. Rules may be included in a program file to direct the dynamic linker's search for unfulfilled references. The linker may also be used to statically link multiple object modules together to form a new object module containing all instructions, data, and other information in the original object modules. Omnibus elements may be used as data by applications or may serve to hold structured information for applications and system utilities. There is no assumed structure to an omnibus element. For compatibility with earlier (basic mode) programming models, there are relocatable and absolute element types. Relocatable elements are the output of basic mode compilers. They may be combined by the basic mode static linker (@MAP ‚Äì the collector) to form an \\"absolute\\" element which is executable.  File management  OS 2200 implements a fully virtual file system. Files may be allocated anywhere across any and all mass storage devices. Mass storage is treated as a large space pool similar to the way virtual memory is managed. While contiguous space is allocated if possible, mass storage is treated as a set of pages of 8KB size and a file can be placed in as many areas of the same or different devices as is required. Dynamic expansion of files attempts to allocate space adjacent to the previous allocation, but will find space wherever it is available. In fact, files need not even be present on mass storage to be used. The Exec and the file backup system are fully integrated. When file backups are made, the tape reel number(s) are recorded in the file directory. If space gets short on mass storage, some files are simply marked as \\"unloaded\\" if they have a current backup copy, and their space is available for use. If enough space can't be found that way, a backup is started. Any reference to an unloaded file will be queued while the file is copied back to mass storage. The whole system is automatic and generally transparent to users.  Access methods  In general, the Exec does not provide access methods. Files are simply containers. Access methods are provided by the language run time systems and the database manager. The one exception is a fixed-block access method provided for high-volume transaction processing. It has much less overhead than the database manager, but does participate in all locking, clustering, and recovery mechanisms.  Removable packs  When clients want more explicit control over the location of files, they can use the \\"removable pack\\" concept. At one time these truly represented physically removable disk packs, and the operating system would automatically generate pack mount requests to operators as needed. Today they are still used to place files, usually database files or transaction files, on one or more disk volumes. Files may still span multiple disk volumes, and now the list of volume names is given when the file is created. Files that are on such volume groups are still backed up but are not subject to automatic virtual space management.  CIFS  OS 2200 also provides a full implementation of the Common Internet File System (CIFS). CIFS implements the SMB protocol used by Microsoft servers and the UNIX/Linux Samba software. CIFS for ClearPath OS 2200 is both a file server and file client to other CIFS-compliant systems. This includes desktop PCs running Windows. CIFS supports SMB message signing. To maintain OS 2200 security, CIFS for ClearPath OS 2200 provides two levels of protection. First, OS 2200 files are not visible to the network until they have been declared as \\"shares\\" with a CIFS command. A specific privilege exists to control who may declare a share. The second level of control is that all access is still protected by OS 2200 security. Clients accessing OS 2200 via CIFS will either have to be automatically identified via NTLM or Kerberos or they will be presented with a query for their OS 2200 user id and password. CIFS allows OS 2200 files to be presented in a hierarchical view. Typically the qualifier will appear as the highest level in the tree followed by filename, element name, and version. In addition, files may be stored on OS 2200 servers using the full Windows filename format. Windows applications will see OS 2200 as another file server. OS 2200 applications have APIs available to read and write files existing on other CIFS-compliant servers, such as Windows file servers, in the network. Text files are automatically converted to and from OS 2200 internal formats. Binary files must be understood by the application program. The CIFSUT utility running under OS 2200 can exchange encrypted compressed files with other software, such as WinZip. = Subsystems = The concept of subsystems and protected subsystems are central to the design of OS 2200. A subsystem is most analogous to a .dll in Windows. It is code and data that may be shared among all programs running in the system. In OS 2200 each subsystem has its own set of banks that reside in a separate part of the address space that cannot be directly accessed by any user program. Instead the hardware and the OS provide a \\"gate\\" that may be the target of a Call instruction. See Unisys 2200 Series system architecture for more information. The database managers, run time libraries, messaging system, and many other system functions are implemented as subsystems. Some subsystems, usually consisting of pure code, such as the run time libraries, may be the direct target of a Call instruction without requiring a gate. These subsystems run in the user program's protection environment. Other subsystems, such as the database managers, consist of code and data or privileged code and may only be called via a gate. These subsystems may also have access control lists associated with them to control who may call them. More importantly, the gate controls the specific entry points that are visible, the protection environment in which the subsystem will run, and often a user-specific parameter that provides additional secure information about the caller. = Security = B1 security  The OS 2200 security system is designed to protect data from unauthorized access, modification, or exposure. It includes an implementation of the DoD Orange Book B1 level specification. OS 2200 first obtained a successful B1 evaluation in September, 1989. That evaluation was maintained until 1994. After that point, OS 2200 developers continued to follow development and documentation practices required by the B1 evaluation. Central to a B1 system are the concepts of users and objects. Users have identities, clearance levels, compartments and privileges. Objects require certain combinations of those for various types of access. Objects in OS 2200 consist of files, protected subsystems, devices, and tape reels. The security profile of a user session includes the user identity, clearance level (0-63), compartment set, and set of allowed privileges. OS 2200 implements both Mandatory Access Control (MAC) and Discretionary Access Control (DAC) based on the Bell-La Padula model for confidentiality (no read up, no write down) and the Biba integrity model (no read down, no write up). For a run to read or execute a file, the run's executing clearance level must be greater than or equal to the clearance level of the file, and the file's clearance level must be 0 or within the clearance level range of the run; in addition, the run's executing compartment set must contain the file's compartment set. Because OS 2200 combines the Bell-La Padula and Biba model requirements, a run's executing clearance level and compartment set must exactly match those of a file to permit writing to the file or deleting it. DAC associates an access control list with an object; the list identifies users and user groups that have access and defines the type of access that user or group is allowed (read, write, execute, or delete). Because the full set of B1 controls is too restrictive for most environments, system administrators can configure servers by choosing which controls to apply. A set of security levels from Fundamental Security through Security Level 3 serves as a starting point.  Security officer  Every OS 2200 system has one user designated as the security officer. On systems configured with fundamental security, only the security officer is allowed to perform certain tasks. On systems configured with higher levels of security, other trusted users may be allowed to perform some of these tasks. OS 2200 provides a fine-grained security mechanism based on the principle of least privilege. This principle demands that only the minimum privilege be granted necessary to perform the task required. Thus, OS 2200 has no concept of a \\"Super User\\" role that can be assumed by any user. Rather it uses a large set of specific privileges which may be granted separately to each user. Each privilege is associated with a specific authority.  File security  On systems configured with security level 1 or higher levels, the user who creates an object is the object's owner. The default is that the object is private to the creating user, but it may also be public or controlled by an access control list. The owner or the security officer may create an access control list for that object. On system configured with fundamental security, files do not have owners. Instead, they are created private to an account or project, or they are public. Access to them can be controlled by read and write keys.  Authentication  When users log on to the system, they identify themselves and optionally select the clearance level and compartment set they will use for this session. OS 2200 offers a flexible authentication system. Multiple authentication mechanisms are supported concurrently. Client- or third party-written authentication software may also be used. Standard authentication capabilities include: *User id and password maintained in an encrypted file by OS 2200 *Authentication performed by an external system such as Microsoft Windows using its user id and password mechanism *NTLM *Kerberos *LDAP The last two permit the use of biometrics, smart cards, and any other authentication mechanism supported by those technologies.  Encryption  OS 2200 provides encryption for data at rest through Cipher API, a software subsystem that encrypts and decrypts caller data. Cipher API also supports the use of a hardware accelerator card for bulk data encryption. For CMOS-based Dorado servers, CPComm provides SSL/TLS encryption for data in transit. For Intel-based Dorado servers, SSL and TLS are provided by openSSL, which is included in the Dorado firmware. All Dorado servers support TLS levels 1.0 through 1.2, as well as SSLv3, but SSL is disabled by default because of vulnerabilities in the protocol. Both CPComm and Cipher API use the encryption services of CryptoLib, a FIPS-certified software encryption module. The AES and Triple DES algorithms are among the algorithms implemented in CryptoLib. OS 2200 also supports encrypting tape drives, which provide encryption for archive data.  Clustering  OS 2200 systems may be clustered to achieve greater performance and availability than a single system. Up to 4 systems may be combined into a cluster sharing databases and files via shared disks. A hardware device, the XPC-L, provides coordination among the systems by providing a high-speed lock manager for database and file access. A clustered environment allows each system to have its own local files, databases, and application groups along with shared files and one or more shared application groups. Local files and databases are accessed only by a single system. Shared files and databases must be on disks that are simultaneously accessible from all systems in the cluster. The XPC-L provides a communication path among the systems for coordination of actions. It also provides a very fast lock engine. Connection to the XPC-L is via a special I/O processor that operates with extremely low latencies. The lock manager in the XPC-L provides all the functions required for both file and database locks. This includes deadlock detection and the ability to free up locks of failed applications. The XPC-L is implemented with two physical servers to create a fully redundant configuration. Maintenance, including loading new versions of the XPC-L firmware, may be performed on one of the servers while the other continues to run. Failures, including physical damage to one server, do not stop the cluster, as all information is kept in both servers.  Operations and administration = Operations = OS 2200 operations is built around active operators and one or more consoles. Each console is a terminal window, part of which is reserved for a fixed display that is frequently updated with summary information about activity in the system. The rest of the console is used as a scrolling display of events. When a message is issued that requires an operator response, it is given a number from 0 to 9 and remains on the display until it is answered. Tape mount messages do scroll with other messages but will be repeated every two minutes until the tape is mounted. Operations Sentinel is used for all OS 2200 operations. OS 2200 consoles are simply windows within an Operations Sentinel display. There may be as many display PCs as desired. Remote operation is typical. Operations Sentinel supports any number of ClearPath, Windows, Linux, and UNIX systems. An auto-action message database is released with the product. This database allows Operations Sentinel to recognize messages. Scripts may be written to automatically respond to messages that require a response, hide unwanted messages, translate them to other languages, create events, etc. Full dark room operation is used by some clients. At most they will have Operations Sentinel displays at remote locations monitoring the system and creating alerts when certain events occur. = Administration = Administration of OS 2200 systems is performed using a wide variety of tools, each specialized to a particular area of the system. For example, there is a tool used for administering the transaction environment that allows new transaction programs to be installed, specifies all the necessary information about them, changes the queuing structure, priorities, and concurrency levels, and so on. Other tools are specific to the security officer and allow creation of users, changing allowed privileges, changing system security settings, etc.,, Most of the tools have a graphical interface although some do not. All provide a batch stored file interface where all actions are specified in the control stream. This allows scripting any and all of the administrative interfaces from either local sites, maybe based on time of day or other events, or from remote sites. Unique privileges are required for each administrative area.  Application groups  Application groups are a logical construct consisting of an instance of the Universal Data System (UDS), an instance of the message queue subsystem, and some set of transactions. Each application group has its own audit trail. OS 2200 supports a maximum of 16 application groups in a system. The notion of application group corresponds to what is often called \\"an application.\\" That is, a set of programs and data that represent some larger unit of connected processing. For example, an application group might represent an airline system. Another application group might represent the corporate finance system. Or, application groups might represent instances of the same application and data models, as in bank branches. The important thing is that each application group has its own environment, sessions, recovery, etc. Application groups may be started, stopped, and recovered independently. Application groups do not have their own accounting and scheduling rules. Transactions in multiple application groups may share the same priorities and have interleaved priorities. This permits the site to control the relative priorities of transactions across the entire system.

Elwell (born 1945) served as Mayor of Secaucus, New Jersey from 2000 until July 28, 2009, when he resigned after allegations of political corruption. Biography Elwell was born in Secaucus, New Jersey and has lived his entire life there. His father, Nelson Howard Elwell, was a seven- term councilman in Secaucus. In 1965, Elwell left Secaucus to serve in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War. His Army unit, the 173rd Airborne Brigade, was the first major ground combat unit to serve in Vietnam. Elwell was elected to the Secaucus Board of Education in 1991. In 1992, he was elected to the Town Council as an independent. He unsuccessfully ran against Mayor Anthony E. Just three times. In 1999, he joined the Democratic Party and defeated Just in the Democratic primary, and went on to win the general election. He was re- elected mayor in 2001 and 2005. Elwell was a strong proponent of the construction of Secaucus Junction, a major rail hub that opened in 2003. Elwell is president of his family's trucking business, N.H. Elwell & Sons. He and his wife, Annette, have two children, Jason, and Alexis. A son, Travis, died in 1989 at the age of 18 when his car was hit by an oncoming New Jersey Transit train. Arrest and conviction on federal corruption charges On July 23, 2009, Elwell was arrested as part of Operation Bid Rig, a joint operation of the FBI, the IRS, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey into political corruption and money laundering. Elwell was charged with accepting a $10,000 cash bribe from an FBI informant who sought assistance in building a hotel in Secaucus. Five days after his arrest, on July 28, Elwell announced that effective immediately, he would resign his position as mayor. In a statement announcing his resignation, Elwell said, \\"Those who perceive this action to be an admission of culpability as to the pending criminal allegations are gravely mistaken.\\" Elwell was immediately succeeded by John Reilly, who had been serving as councilman and deputy mayor. Richard Steffens was then selected as mayor. On November 17, 2009, Elwell and alleged middleman Ronald Manzo were formally indicted on three counts: conspiracy to commit extortion, attempted extortion, and accepting corrupt payments in connection with a business transaction with a municipality that received federal funds. The charges carry maximum prison terms of 20 years. On December 4, Elwell and Manzo pleaded not guilty. Manzo eventually pleaded guilty and became the government's star witness against Elwell. On July 6, 2011, Elwell was found guilty on the bribery charge and acquitted of charges of attempted extortion and conspiracy to commit extortion. Prior to sentencing, he suffered an aneurysm.Al Sullivan, \\"They don't want you to fight back\\": Former Mayor Elwell returns to Secaucus after 30 months in federal prison, Hudson Reporter, November 9, 2014. In 2011, Elwell, then 66 years old, was sentenced to two and a half years in prison. He was imprisoned at the Federal Correctional Complex, Butner, and his appeal was rejected. While in prison, Elwell suffered from kidney stones and worked as a groundskeeper. He was released in October 2014 and returned to his home in Secaucus's North End.

Both models suggest that people's development and emotional affect are differentially susceptible to experiences or qualities of the environment. Where the Diathesis-stress model suggests a distinct and mostly negativity- sensitive group, Belsky describes a group that is sensitive to negative experiences but also to positive experiences. These models may be complementary, if some individuals are dually or uniquely positivity- sensitive, while other people are uniquely negativity-sensitive.  Differential Susceptibility versus Diathesis-Stress  The idea that individuals vary in their responsivity to negative qualities of the environment is generally framed in diathesis-stressMonroe & Simons, 1991; Zuckerman, 1999 or dual-risk terms.Sameroff, 1983 That is, some individuals, due to their biological, temperamental and/or behavioral characteristics (i.e., \\"diathesis\\" or \\"risk 1\\"), are more vulnerable to the adverse effects of negative experiences (i.e., \\"stress\\" or \\"risk 2\\"), whereas others are relatively resilient with respect to them (see Figure 1, an adaptation of Bakermans-Kranenburg and van IJzendoorn's (2007) Figure 1). A fundamentally different, even if not competing view, of the very same phenomenon is central to Belsky'sBelsky 1997b; 1997a; 2005 differential susceptibility hypothesis and Boyce and Ellis' (2005) related notion of biological sensitivity to context: Individuals do not simply vary in the degree to which they are vulnerable to the negative effects of adverse experience but, more generally, in their developmental plasticity. On this hypothesis, more \\"plastic\\" or malleable individuals are more susceptible than others to environmental influences in a for-better-and-for-worse manner.Belsky, Bakermans-Kranenburg, & van IJzendoorn, 2007 That is, susceptible to both the adverse developmental sequelae associated with negative environments and the positive developmental consequences of supportive ones. Less susceptible individuals, in contrast, are less affected by rearing conditions, be they presumptively supportive or undermining of well being (see Figure 2, an adaptation of Bakermans-Kranenburg and Van IJzendoorn's (2007) Figure 1).  Theoretical background  Belsky suggests that evolution might select for some children who are more plastic, and others who are more fixed in the face of, for example, parenting styles. Belsky offers that ancestral parents, just like parents today, could not have known (consciously or unconsciously) which childrearing practices would prove most successful in promoting the reproductive fitness of offspring‚Äîand thus their own inclusive fitness. As a result, and as a fitness optimizing strategy involving bet hedging,Philipi & Seger, 1989 natural selection might have shaped parents to bear children varying in plasticity.Belsky, 1997a, 2005 This way, if an effect of parenting had proven counterproductive in fitness terms, those children not affected by parenting would not have incurred the cost of developing in ways that ultimately proved \\"misguided\\". Importantly, natural selection might favour genetic lines with both plastic and fixed developmental and affective patterns. In other words, there is value to having both kinds at once. In light of inclusive-fitness considerations, children who were less malleable (and more fixed) would have \\"resistance\\" to parental influence. This could be adaptable some times, and maladaptive other times. Their fixedness would not only have benefited themselves directly, but even their more malleable siblings indirectly. This is because siblings, like parents and children, have 50% of their genes in common. By the same token, had parenting influenced children in ways that enhanced fitness, then not only would more plastic offspring have benefited directly by following parental leads, but so, too, would their parents and even their less malleable siblings who did not benefit from the parenting they received, again for inclusive-fitness reasons. The overall effect may be to temper some of the variability in parenting. That is, to make more conservative bets. This line of evolutionary argument leads to the prediction that children should vary in their susceptibility to parental rearing and perhaps to environmental influences more generally. As it turns out, a long line of developmental inquiry, informed by a \\"transactional\\" perspective,Sameroff, 1983 has more or less been based on this unstated assumption.  Criteria for the testing of differential susceptibility  Belsky, Bakermans-Kranenburg, & Van IJzendoorn, (2007) delineated a series of empirical requirements‚Äîor steps‚Äîfor evidencing the differential susceptibility hypothesis. Particularly they identify tests that distinguish differential susceptibility from other interaction effects including diathesis-stress/dual- risk. While diathesis-stress/dual-risk arises when the most vulnerable are disproportionately affected in an adverse manner by a negative environment but do not also benefit disproportionately from positive environmental conditions, differential susceptibility is characterized by a cross-over interaction: the susceptible individuals are disproportionately affected by both negative and positive experiences. A further criterion that needs to be fulfilled to distinguish differential susceptibility from diathesis-stress/dual-risk is the independence of the outcome measure from the susceptibility factor: if the susceptibility factor and the outcome are related, diathesis-stress/dual-risk is suggested rather than differential susceptibility. Further, environment and susceptibility factor must also be unrelated to exclude the alternative explanation that susceptibility merely represents a function of the environment. The specificity of the differential-susceptibility effect is demonstrated if the model is not replicated when other susceptibility factors (i.e., moderators) and outcomes are used. Finally, the slope for the susceptible subgroup should be significantly different from zero and at the same time significantly steeper than the slope for the non- (or less-) susceptible subgroup.  Susceptibility markers and empirical evidence Characteristics of individuals that have been shown to moderate environmental effects in a manner consistent with the differential susceptibility hypothesis can be subdivided into three categories:see Belsky & Pluess, 2009 Genetic factors, endophenotypic factors, phenotypic factors. Bakermans-Kranenburg and Van IJzendoorn (2006) were the first to test the differential susceptibility hypothesis as a function of Genetic Factors regarding the moderating effect of the dopamine receptor D4 7-repeat polymorphism (DRD4-7R) on the association between maternal sensitivity and externalizing behavior problems in 47 families. Children with the DRD4-7R allele and insensitive mothers displayed significantly more externalizing behaviors than children with the same allele but with sensitive mothers. Children with the DRD4-7R allele and sensitive mothers had the least externalizing behaviors of all whereas maternal sensitivity had no effect on children without the DRD4-7R allele. Endophenotypic Factors have been examined by Obradovic, Bush, Stamperdahl, Adler and Boyce's (2010). They investigated associations between childhood adversity and child adjustment in 338 5-year olds. Children with high cortisol reactivity were rated by teachers as least prosocial when living under adverse conditions, but most prosocial when living under more benign conditions (and in comparison to children scoring low on cortisol reactivity). Regarding characteristics of the category of Phenotypic Factors, Pluess and Belsky (2009) reported that the effect of child care quality on teacher-rated socioemotional adjustment varied as a function of infant temperament in the case of 761 4.5-year olds participating in the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 2005). Children with difficult temperaments as infants manifest the most and least behavior problems depending on whether they experienced, respectively, poor or good quality care (and in comparison to children with easier temperaments).

The work promoted sustainable economy in close- knit communities. These include regions that generate their own food, their own energy, their own culture, and their own entertainment. McKibben was interviewed by Salon.com, and was asked what a \\"deep economy\\" was. He defined it as one that \\"cares less about quantity than about quality; that takes as its goal the production of human satisfaction as much as surplus material; that is focused on the idea that it might endure and considers durability at least as important as increases in size.\\" The book has been generally well- received, though some critics have questioned his proposed solutions. Overview The long-standing presumption that \\"more\\" equals \\"better\\" in economic growth is questioned by McKibben, who asks if in fact this idea is valid. McKibben also suggests that unfettered growth is not a realistic, sustainable goal. According to McKibben, the invention of the steam engine and the Industrial Revolution in 1712 resulted in a mindset which rapidly altered expectations of economic growth. He also said that, \\"The current political assumption ignores both the problems of resource depletion and inequity, which leads to human unhappiness.\\" In its place, McKibben suggested that the focus should be on \\"deep economy\\", which includes, rather than constant growth, a consideration of human satisfaction. As an example of the problem with the current philosophy, McKibben focuses extensively on global, industrial agriculture, which he argues has endangered localized farming communities, damaged the environment, increased the risk of terrorist sabotage of a central food supply, increased food-borne illnesses, led to more mistreatment of farmworkers, and accelerated the depletion of water and oil. The solution to these problems, he suggests, is community-centered farming as currently practiced in Cuba, with similar projects in New England and Detroit. He also examines the West's attitude towards economic inequity. The mega-rich are praised and admired, a symptom of the \\"hyper-individualization\\" that McKibben regards as a social failure, ecologically, politically and morally. Human beings are psychologically healthier, not to mention happier, when part of a community. Accordingly, community-based economies, wherein goods are locally produced and consumed, foster neighborliness and happiness. To the end of fostering close communities, McKibben offers several suggestions, ranging from encouraging the use of public transportation to offering a close living environment where multiple residents share living spaces in interconnected condominiums; from developing sustainable alternative energy sources to developing and utilizing a local currency (such as BerkShares) in addition to a national one. By contrast to such economists and commentators as Deirdre McCloskey, Thomas Friedman and Jeffrey Sachs, McKibben does not promote globalization in the developing world, which he views as an ineffective means of raising the global standard of living and unsustainable given limited global resources. Critical reception The book was generally well-received, with critics praising the presentation though sometimes questioning his solutions. Preceding their interview with the author, Salon.com described his future as \\"credible\\" and his account of the problems the world faces and the path to the current crisis \\"compelling.\\" Bloomberg suggested that \\"the book is given to one-sidedness and oversimplification\\", with answers that may not be workable, but added that it isn't gloomy or \\"tedious...: it has barely a dull sentence\\" as McKibben \\"makes his case with flair and a wealth of fascinating detail....\\" A review in The New York Times by Lance Morrow noted that the book was \\"suffused with a certain Vermontlichkeit\\" and offers the occasional \\"ghastly idea\\", but cautioned, \\"It would be unwise to dismiss McKibben‚Äôs ideas as pipe dreams or Luddism. He makes his case on anecdotal, environmental, moral and, as it were, aesthetic grounds.\\" ReferencesFurther reading *  External links  *\\"Diving into Deep Economy\\", OneBookUTA, University of Texas at Arlington. *Bill McKibben: \\"Deep Economy\\", Interview.

He is known as \\"the first Haitian singer to break into the Jamaican reggae scene\\", tearing down national and cultural walls and paving the way for the next generation of Haitian artists. Today's most talented Haitian artists, such as Wyclef Jean and Mecca aka Grimo, credit Bigga as an influence.  Early life  Born Charles Dorismond in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Bigga hails from a musical family. His father, Andre Dorismond, was the lead singer of The Webert Sicot Group, pioneers of Haitian dance music known as compas (kompa). Bigga immigrated to New York City at the age of 8 and grew up amidst the pulsating rhythms of reggae music in the vibrant Jamaican community of Flatbush, Brooklyn. Bigga knew that he was destined to become a reggae singer after seeing Admiral Bailey perform his hit tune \\"Big Belly Man\\" at Manhattan's Reggae Lounge in 1987. At this moment, reggae sensation Bigga Haitian was born.  Musical career  Bigga released his first single, \\"Haiti A Weh Mi From\\" (Flames Records), in 1989. The track reached #1 on the Haitian charts, and is still a staple of Haitian radio to this day. Bigga's first full album, 1997's I Am Back (Royal Productions/Jomino/Roots International), features a remix of this dancehall anthem. In 2002, Bigga released his second album, Binghi Mon. The title track was inspired by racial profiling of Rastafarians and other groups following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Also called \\"The Osama Tune,\\" the song rails against violence, denouncing the Taliban and Osama bin Laden. Over the next few years, Bigga performed with many reggae legends, sharing the stage with luminaries such as Shabba Ranks, Cocoa Tea and Junior Reid. Bigga's unique brand of toasting enabled him to cross over into hip-hop, opening for Lil' Kim and Jay-Z. In 2006, Bigga signed with his current label, New York-based independent, Walkup Records. Several years earlier, Walkup co-founder Marc Lawrence had signed Bigga to a publishing deal with another company. In February 2006, Lawrence brought Bigga to Walkup's other co-founder Brett Smith's home studio to demo some new songs. Smith and Lawrence recognized the potential in the reggae veteran's material and signed him immediately. In an interview with Skope Magazine, Bigga offered high praise for his new label, \\"After twenty years of making reggae music, just now, I feel that I'm in the music business because of these guys' professionalism.\\" Later that year, Bigga's first track for Walkup, \\"Gi Me Da Weed\\" was released as a digital single to \\"monster downloads from iTunes, Rhapsody and eMusic\\" and \\"heavy airplay on reggae radio stations.\\" A full album, Sak Pas√© was released online in 2009 and was released on CD in early 2010. On August 12, 2009, \\"King of Glory\\" from 2003's Binghi Mon and \\"London Massive\\" from 2009's Sak Pas√© were featured in the series finale of NBC's The Philanthropist.  Patrick Dorismond  Bigga's brother Patrick Dorismond was killed by members of the New York Police Department on March 16, 2000. Bigga honored the memory of his late brother with \\"Tribute to Patrick Dorismond\\" a track released as a 7\\" single by Jah Life Int'l Records and later included on Bigga's 2003 album, Binghi Mon. Revered reggae artist Barrington Levy donated his anthem \\"Murderer\\" to serve as the basis for the track. \\"Tribute\\" was produced by Jah Life, who also produced the original Barrington Levy recording.

Borophagus orc existed for approximately .PaleoBiology Database: Borophagus orc, basic info Overview Borophagus, like other Borophaginae, are loosely known as \\"bone-crushing\\" or \\"hyena-like\\" dogs. Though not the most massive borophagine by size or weight, it had a more highly evolved capacity to crunch bone than earlier, larger genera such as Epicyon, which seems to be an evolutionary trend of the group (Turner, 2004). During the Pliocene epoch, Borophagus began being displaced by Canis genera such as Canis edwardii and later by Canis dirus. Early species of Borophagus were placed in the genus Osteoborus until recently, but the genera are now considered synonyms. Borophagus orc possibly led a hyena-like lifestyle scavenging carcasses of recently dead animals. Taxonomy Typical features of this genus are a bulging forehead and powerful jaws; it was probably a scavenger. Its crushing premolar teeth and strong jaw muscles would have been used to crack open bone, much like the hyena of the Old World. The adult animal is estimated to have been about in length, similar to a coyote, although it was much more powerfully built. Recombination Borophagus orc was recombined by X. Wang in 1999. It was previously named Osteoborus orc. Fossil distribution Specimens have been found at only two sites: near Withlacoochee River, Florida and coastal North Carolina.

Based on her representation in codical almanacs, she is considered to represent vital functions of the fertile woman, and to preside over eroticism, human procreation, and marriage.Taube 1992:145 Her aged form is associated with weaving. Goddess I could, perhaps, be seen as a terrestrial counterpart to the Maya moon goddess. In important respects, she corresponds to Xochiquetzal among the Aztecs, a deity with no apparent connection to the moon.Possible representation of Goddess I in the Classic Period. Museo de Am√©rica, Madrid Name and attributes The hieroglyphical name of the goddess consists of a female head characterized by a hair-like curl (prefixed or infixed). The curl is not unimportant, since it is usually assumed to be the sign of the earth (kab º[an]) or the moon (Landa's u-sign), with the goddess being identified accordingly. However, the curl might, perhaps, better be viewed as the post-Classic rendition of the infix and hair curl characteristic of Classic glyphs for 'woman' (ixik).Stone and Zender 2011: 35 The head of goddess I is often preceded by the glyph for 'white' (sak). The figure of goddess I shows a restricted set of variable attributes, amongst which is also the coiled snake headband of goddess O. As a mantic designation, 'White Woman' contrasts with 'Red Woman', a name referring to the aged patroness of midwifery, Ixchel (the goddess O). In the codices, the main female functions have been distributed over the White Woman - the Red Woman. Functions in ancient almanacs Goddess I is the subject of almanacs which take up several pages in the Post-Classic codices of Dresden (16-23) and Madrid (91-95). There, she is chiefly represented in the following ways:Thompson 1972:47-60 *Carrying a bird on the shoulders: The bird species have been argued to refer to the names of specific diseases mentioned in early-colonial medical treatises (especially the Ritual of the Bacabs). Goddess I thereby appears to function as a general mother of disease. *Carrying a deity or a symbol in a carrying-strap on her back: The deity (e.g., the rain god, the death god) or the symbol (e.g., 'abundance') contains a general prognostication. *Holding a deity as a child on her lap: The deity so held may contain a prediction relative to the child's development. *Seated opposite another deity or animal: The combinations with a deity or an animal (vulture, armadillo, deer, dog) seem to refer to the prospects of marriage, in the Madrid codex symbolized by the reed mat on which the couples have been placed. The deity or the animal may be indicative of certain qualities of the male partner in marriage, with the female partner representing the constant element. In some cases - involving a young deity as well as the old, lecherous God N - the coupling has unmistakably erotic overtones. *Seated on the lap of another deity: This occurs only once, and involves the aged God L. The prognostication may conceivably refer to the sort of husband that can be expected to take and marry the woman, or to the deity's influence on the female partner in marriage. Classic correspondences Woman embraced by old man, ocarina, Los Angeles County Museum of Art With the exception of the disease-carrying birds, several depictions of the goddess in the almanacs have their counterparts in the Classic Period: Goddess I can be depicted with the maize child in a carrying-strap on her back; in amorous embrace with an aged and lecherous old man, probably God N;Milbrath 1999:153 as part of the 'harem' of God L (Princeton vase); and in encounters, sometimes markedly erotic, with animals such as armadillo, deer, spider monkey, and stinging insects. The combinations with animals are not well understood. They have been interpreted astronomically (on the assumption that goddess I is identical with the moon goddess),Thompson 1972 but could in principle also be viewed as metaphorical references to marriage; as mythological scenes; or as relating to animal fertility. Mythological comparisons Although in the codices and in Classic Period art, goddess I is not clearly identified with the Maya moon goddess (who can be recognized by her rabbit pet and the lunar crescent), her main functions seem largely to coincide with those of the Moon (excepting the Moon's strong association with water and rain). Mythologically, she has been compared to the underworldly wife of Hun-Hunahpu, Xquic, in the Quichean Popol Vuh,Taube 1992 and to the wife of the deer-hunting hero of Q ºeqchi º Sun and Moon myth, Po 'Moon'.Thompson 1939; 1972:47 Thompson has pointed out that in the Q ºeqchi º myth‚Äîwhich is about the earthly life of a mountain deity's daughter before her final transformation into the Moon‚Äîthe themes of eroticism, fertility, and marriage strongly come to the fore. In contemporary Maya religion generally, goddess I may possibly go under the cloak of the Virgin Mary, in the latter's various aspects and local manifestations, such as that of \\"guardian and embracer of the maize\\".Redfield and Villa 1934: 116 NotesReferences * Susan Milbrath, Star Gods of the Maya: Astronomy in Art, Folklore, and Calendars.

The castle was erected by Casimir III the Great as a fortification during 1357‚Äì1370. History Immediately after its completion, the Castle became a residence of king Casimir the Great, and then was the seat of the governor of ≈Åƒôczyca. In 1406 it was burned by the Teutonic Knights and rebuilt in the following years to serve as a place of a conference in 1409, where decisions were taken in connection with the approaching war with the Order. After the Battle of Grunwald many of the Teutonic Knights were incarcerated here. In subsequent years, four diets were held here (1420, 1448, 1454 and 1462), and the castle became the seat of the king Casimir IV Jagiellon during another war with the Order (1454-1466). After a great fire in the second half of the 15th century the castle remained in ruins till the early 1560s. Then, in 1563‚Äì1565, Jan Lutomirski, Grand Treasurer of the Crown completely rebuilt the castle. The cost of the entire project amounted to nearly 3,000 florins, derived from the royal treasury. The disasters that struck the stronghold in the first half of the 17th century helped the Swedish General Robert Douglas, Count of Skenninge to take the castle, which was defended by starosta Jakub Olbrycht Szczawi≈Ñski, during the Deluge in 1655. The destruction was completed in 1707 during another Swedish occupation. Over the next years local residents used the remains of the castle as a source of building materials. After the World War II, the castle became the seat of the scout troop, and in 1964 reconstruction started.

Borophagus pugnator existed for approximately .PaleoBiology Database: Borophagus pugnator, basic info Overview Borophagus, like other Borophaginae, are loosely known as \\"bone-crushing\\" or \\"hyena-like\\" dogs. Though not the most massive borophagine by size or weight, it had a more highly evolved capacity to crunch bone than earlier, larger genera such as Epicyon, which seems to be an evolutionary trend of the group (Turner, 2004). During the Pliocene epoch, Borophagus began being displaced by Canis genera such as Canis edwardii and later by Canis dirus. Early species of Borophagus were placed in the genus Osteoborus until recently, but the genera are now considered synonyms. Borophagus pugnator possibly led a hyena-like lifestyle scavenging carcasses of recently dead animals. Taxonomy Typical features of this genus are a bulging forehead and powerful jaws; it was probably a scavenger. Its crushing premolar teeth and strong jaw muscles would have been used to crack open bone, much like the hyena of the Old World. The adult animal is estimated to have been about 80 cm in length, similar to a coyote, although it was much more powerfully built. Recombination Borophagus pugnator was originally named Porthocyon pugnator by Cook 1932. It was recombined by Matthew as Aelurodon pugnator in 1924 followed by Matthew and Stirton in 1830. It was then recombined as Osteoborus pugnator by Stirton and VanderHoof in 1933 and others until recombined as Borophagus pugnator by VanderHoof (1931) and X. Wang et al. in 1999. Fossil distribution Specimens were found at only two sites. Near Withlacoochee River, Florida and coastal North Carolina.

A group of said smugglers have just received a shipment of high tech weapons, including one-man portable rocket launchers, but are intercepted and slaughtered by a rival group who take the weapons for themselves. One member of the first group escapes, but is tracked down and killed, along with his mother; his sister Alex survives.

Taking some of the weapons for fun, they accidentally drop a map showing their base camp. The arms smugglers arrive at the shack soon after the boys leave. Using the map the boys dropped, the smugglers arrive at the scout camp to retrieve the weapons. When the scouts react with non-understanding, violence ensues and several of the scouts are killed. The frightened boys flee into the woods, with the smugglers hot on their tracks. The scouts are joined in their fight for survival by Alex, who has taken up arms against her family's slayers.

From 1914 to 1918 he served as a soldier in the First World War. After the end of the war, in 1919 he joined the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany. In 1920 he moved to Munich, where in 1921 he joined the Communist Party of Germany (KDP). In 1922 he became president of the Shoe Workers' Union. From 1923 Buchmann was head of the KPD in Munich.

It was originally published in hardback in 2005. It was a #1 The Times bestseller. Previous books in the series are Blindsighted, Kisscut, A Faint Cold Fear, and Indelible. These books star Sara Linton, Jeffrey Tolliver, and Lena Adams.  Summary  Sara and Jeffrey have finally started to click again when a phone call from the woman he was unfaithful with brings their affair back into sharp relief. He and Sara are arguing about this on a walk in the woods when they make a discovery: the corpse of a young woman who was buried alive in a wooden coffin. They assume her death was accidental, but the autopsy reveals that she was pregnant and had been murdered ‚Äì while she was underground. The search for her identity leads Jeffrey and Lena to an organic soybean farming cooperative out in the sticks owned by a large, tightly knit, religious family, led by the charismatic oldest son. They import their labor force from the people that populate Atlanta's shelters and halfway houses, facilitated through the family church's outreach program. At one time or another the case involves strippers, the one-legged, one-eyed lawyer extraordinaire Buddy Conford, an abused woman Lena both identifies with and wants to save, and a search to find more buried coffins before it's too late. At the novel's conclusion, Sara finally agrees to remarry Jeffrey after at least four proposals, and Ethan pushes Lena so far that she decides it's time to escape.

The building, designed by Cass Gilbert and his son, Cass Gilbert, Jr., p.80 is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as U.S. Courthouse. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York hear cases in the courthouse, which is across the street from the Metropolitan Correctional Center, New York City. History left Architect Cass Gilbert was commissioned to design a new federal courthouse at Foley Square in 1931. Design work began in 1933. Construction began in July 1932 and lasted three and a half years. It was among the first federal skyscrapers constructed. After Gilbert's death, construction was supervised by his son Cass Gilbert Jr. until its completion in 1936. The courthouse was originally known as the Foley Square Courthouse. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (as U.S. Courthouse) on September 2, 1987. Notable events over the years that have occurred in the courthouse include the espionage conspiracy trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg; the guilty plea of Ivan Boesky, who inspired the Gordon Gekko character, to conspiracy charges; and the trial of Martha Stewart.Chad Bray, You Can Go Home Again: Second Circuit To Return to Old Digs, Wall Street Journal (January 2, 2013). In 1992, three large historic courtrooms were restored. The courthouse was substantially renovated in 1999. In 2001, the United States Congress passed a bill renaming the building in honor of Thurgood Marshall,https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-bill/988. who had worked at the courthouse from 1961 to 1965 as a judge of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals before later being elevated to the Supreme Court of the United States. The legislation was signed into law on August 20, 2001, and the building was rededicated on April 15, 2003. From November 2006 to January 2013, the Second Circuit left the Marshall Courthouse while the building underwent extensive renovations. During this period, the Daniel Patrick Moynihan U.S. Courthouse (located across the street) temporarily housed the Second Circuit. The Second Circuit returned to the Marshall Courthouse after renovations were completed. The Courthouse is currently managed by GSA Building Manager Deborah Wallace. Design= Exterior = The building has two major parts, the base and the tower. Including both, the building is tall and 37 stories. The six-story courthouse base is marked by a pilastered facade and a colonnade. Built around three interior courtyards, it is rusticated and irregularly shaped, following the outline of the site. Massive granite steps flanked by large pedestals lead up to the main entrance on Foley Square. Gilbert intended the pedestals to bear two monumental sculptural groups, but they were never executed. Ten four-story Corinthian columns form the imposing portico that shelters the entrance, and the frieze is carved with a detailed floral design. The ends of the entablature above are embellished with roundels, designed to resemble ancient coins, on which are carved the heads of four ancient lawgivers: Plato, Aristotle, Demosthenes, and Moses. The Corinthian capitals crowning the columns of the portico return to top pilasters along the building's other primary facades. Minnesota granite, off- white in color and mottled with peach and gray, was used to finish the exterior elevations of the courthouse. A 30-story square tower is 590 feet in height and is set back from the base parallel to the front of the building. The tower is set back slightly on the 27th floor, marked by urns at the corners. The roof of the tower is pyramidal, pitched steeply, and made of terracotta, with a gold leaf, with a small open lantern, also gold-glazed terracotta, at the top. = Interior = Base  The main hall spans the width of the building along its principal elevation. It is very similar in design and ornamentation to the main hall of the United States Supreme Court building, which Gilbert designed at the same time. Variations on the decorative motifs employed within the main hall appear throughout the rest of the interior. Twenty-nine feet in height, it has green- and black-veined white marble floors; the white marble that lines its walls has gold- and cream- colored veining, providing a subtle but attractive contrast of warm and cool tones. Elaborate molding, featuring a meander (Greek key) design, divides the ceiling into rectangular, coffered sections. The coffers are decorated with large plaster rosettes tipped with 22k gold leaf on alternating backgrounds of crimson and peacock blue, with smaller rosettes at the junctions of the coffers. The colonnade of Corinthian columns Richly ornamental bronzework surrounds many of the interior doors, including those of the elevators. This bronze detailing features an unusual combination of metaphorical images related to law and government, including dolphins, an erudite if somewhat obscure symbol of birth and democratic ideals. Among the other motifs are grasshoppers apparently feeding on stalks of wheat, accompanied by the Greek word meta, meaning \\"to transform\\", which conveys the idea that change, even conflict, is essential to growth; there are also owls, representing wisdom, and acorns and oak leaves, signifying strength and endurance. The building contains 35 courtrooms. Sixteen are original to the courthouse: five in the base and eleven in the tower, including the historic United States Court of Appeals courtroom. All have wood-paneled walls with colossal round arches and fluted Ionic pilasters; the Greek key molding seen in the main hall also enframes the ceilings of the tower courtrooms. The Court of Appeals courtroom ceiling also depicts nautical symbols.  Tower  Within the tower, at the twenty-fifth floor, a double-height library features large ceiling beams supported by brackets painted with stenciled foliate designs. The library's high, arched windows offer stunning views of the Manhattan skyline.  Adjacent buildings  The courthouse has three particularly striking neighbors. Flanking it are two high-rise structures: the Manhattan Municipal Building (1914) by McKim, Mead, and White; and the Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse (1994) by Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates. Adjacent to the Thurgood Marshall U.S. Courthouse, and also facing Foley Square, is the New York County Courthouse (1926) by Guy Lowell.  Critical review  The courthouse was not unanimously well-received when it was completed. Architecture critic Lewis Mumford called it \\"the supreme example of pretentiousness, mediocrity, bad design and fake grandeur.\\" See also *Foley Square trial References Notes Sources *This article incorporates text from the General Services Administration, which is public domain as a work of the United States federal government.

The current facility was finally opened on 15 June 1998 during the 150th anniversary of the city of √Ölesund. Facility left The facility is built into the coastline of Tueneset, about west of √Ölesund, and offers nearly of public and exhibition space, plus of outdoor space. The aquarium is located in scenic recreational area that includes a view of the coastal islands and the ocean, as well as hiking trails, fishing, and beaches for swimming and diving. The exhibition area includes 11 larger landscape aquariums, including 2 open touch pools and 2 activity pools, plus several smaller aquariums. Together the aquariums provide a representative view of life under water along the Norwegian coast and in the northern Atlantic ocean. Daily dive shows in the Great Atlantic tank let visitors watch the fish being fed.Atlanterhavsparken: Mating av fisker og dyr Retrieved 12 February 2015. Some of the species in this tank are cod, halibut, conger and salmon. On weekends, visitors can help feed the fish in the open pools. In 2014, the \\"Selbukta\\" opened, which is one of the largest seal exhibits in the world. This outside exhibit houses harbor seals. The exhibition area showcases marine life from all coasts of the Atlantic Ocean, particularly in the waters surrounding Norway. Species from various ocean depths are on display, including marine life from deep water habitats. In order to withstand the pressure in the deep water tanks, the panels needed to be cast thick. The nearly seamless bonds required for this mean that visitors to the park get a nearly unimpeded view of the underwater world beyond. The Aquarium includes a Cafe and gift shop.

Retrieved 2010-08-17. Ashley's father worked as an official at the Board of Trade.Gilbert, Martin. In Search of Churchill (1994), p.137-9. Career In 1929 he was appointed literary assistant to Winston Churchill, who had just begun work on his biography Marlborough: His Life and Times. Ashley provided Churchill with original material from archives in Britain and Europe,Gilbert, Martin. Churchill, A Life (1991), p.491. earning ¬£300 a year for this half-time employment.Jenkins, Roy. Churchill (2001). Although he was unimpressed by Ashley's socialistic views, Churchill praised his \\"competence and industry as an historical investigator\\". Ashley later wrote Churchill as Historian (1968), a perceptive analysis of Churchill's methods. Ashley's career as a journalist began when he joined the staff of the Manchester Guardian as a leader writer in 1933, moving to The Times in 1937 as a foreign sub-editor. He continued to write, publishing Oliver Cromwell: the Conservative Dictator in 1937 and his own short book on Marlborough in 1939. He was briefly editor of Britain Today in 1939-40 but in 1940 enlisted in the Grenadier Guards, later being transferred to the Intelligence Corps. By 1945 he had achieved the rank of major. After World War II, he joined the BBC's weekly publication, The Listener, as Deputy Editor and was appointed Editor in 1958, in which job he remained until retiring in 1967. He broadened the range of the journal, which had been a vehicle for the text of selected broadcasts and criticism of radio and then television programmes. Under Ashley, The Listener's book reviews played a leading role in killing off the 19th-century tradition of anonymous reviewing. Among a number of books, Ashley's publications in this period included his The Greatness of Oliver Cromwell (1957), a substantial revision of his earlier view of Cromwell, and The Glorious Revolution of 1688 (1966). After retiring from The Listener, the rate of his publications increased, helped by a two-year research fellowship at Loughborough University. This period saw the publication of his studies of Charles II, James II, Prince Rupert, and his General Monck (1977), regarded as one of his best books. His last book, The Battle of Naseby and the Fall of King Charles I (1992), appeared when he was 85. Ashley was awarded a CBE in 1978 and a DLitt from Oxford in 1979. He was President of the Cromwell Association from 1961 to 1977. He married twice, first in 1935 to Phyllis Mary Griffiths, with whom he had a son and a daughter, and second in 1988 to Patricia Entract.

During the political crisis and mass uprising in East Pakistan following the 1970 first democratic elections of Pakistan, Forum led the chorus of Bengali intellectuals expressing disillusionment with the Pakistani establishment and the inevitability of the breakup of Pakistan.

Plot summary  While at the Dairy Queen with her pregnant sister Tessa, Sara is called to meet Jeffrey at the scene of an apparent suicide on campus property, a suicide they both later agree seems suspicious though they can't quite put their fingers on why. Tessa asks to go along and Sara, against her better judgment, allows it. As Sara is examining the body, Tessa walks into the woods to relieve herself. Also on hand are Lena, who's quit the force and now works for campus security, and her new boss, steroidal creep Chuck Gaines. Chuck identifies the victim as the son of two campus professors, a development sure the complicate the case exponentially for Jeffrey. When Tessa doesn't come out of the woods, a search finds her stabbed repeatedly and barely alive; she's airlifted to Grady Hospital in Atlanta. While Sara and her parents wait tensely by Tessa's bedside, Jeffrey and Lena work the case while at each other's throats over Lena's decision to quit the force. Another suicide occurs, more suspicious than the last, and as Lena spirals farther out of control with alcohol and drugs, she makes a fateful and perhaps fatal connection with student Ethan Green, who is not what he appears to be.

Founded in 2001, the overall mission of this organization to give these individuals the opportunity to receive the resources that they need to become pillars in society. It is one of the only scholarship organizations that is solely for LGBTQ students. The program itself provides a foundation that includes professional development, funding, and many additional forms of personal training.  Mission Statement  The fund's mission statement is: \\"Point Foundation empowers promising lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer students to achieve their full academic and leadership potential ‚Äì despite the obstacles often put before them ‚Äì to make a significant impact on society.\\"  Programs = Scholarships = The Point Foundation provides many specified scholarships that are assigned to an applicant by their academics, interests, fields of study, and their amount of financial need. The complete list is provided below: * The Point Scholarship * Allan Gilmour & Eric Jirgens Point Scholarship * Bob Fennell Point Scholarship * Bryan L. Knapp Point Scholarship * Calamus Foundation Point Scholarship * Casey Sakir Point Scholarship * Gregory Grosh Point Scholarship * HBO Point Scholarship * Jan Aronson Point Scholarship * Joan R. Heller Point Scholarship * Dr. Joan W. Fernandez Point Scholarship * Jonathan D.

Speier Point Scholarship * Phyllis Mandler & Gary Elden Point Scholarship * Rand Skolnick Point Scholarship * Thomas and Sara Branton Point Scholarship * Time Warner Point Scholarship * University of Phoenix Point Scholarship * Walter M. Decker Point Scholarship * Wells Fargo Point Scholarship = Mentoring = The program explicitly stresses the influence of mentors in society and personal growth. Individuals must work with others to develop their ideals and their overall plans for the advancement of the outside world. Mentors are selected by an application process, similar to the one used to select Point Scholars. Those who are chosen go through training and development to become a viable mentor, and even a desirable partner to scholars in the program. Although mentors serve the students, they inadvertently gain skills in enrichment and community service through the mentor process. = Leadership and Community Service = Leadership Development Programs are required programs that Point Scholars must complete throughout the year. They include national and regional meetings, as well as workshops and trainings. This gives students the opportunity to build their leadership skills and their cooperation with others. They use these skills to perform their other requirements. For example, in association with the leadership portion of the scholarship, the Point Scholars must create a Community Service Project annually. They work with their mentors to get involved in society and promote the advancement of the LGBTQ community. = Internship = Internships are suggested and listed for the Point Scholars, prompting them to apply and take advantage. There are many programs partnered with the foundation, such as the NBCUniversal, The Palette Fund, and Viacom. There is also an open line of communication for more companies tor each out and partner with the foundation. These internships are used to give the students hands-on experience in the advancement of society in regards to the LGBTQ community. There is even the opportunity to get paid for taking internships into consideration. The Point Scholarship funds their time, while the company they work for has to pay nothing to the scholar.  Community College Program  In 2016, Point initiated a new Community College Scholarship Program, a one-year transformative experience offering academic and personal development for community college students as they plan to transfer to a four-year institution. Wells Fargo funded the inaugural year of the program which assisted 11 students. Point has since expanded the Community College Scholarship Program, accepting approximately 25 students each year. Students accepted into the program will receive up to a $3,700 tuition scholarship, admissions counseling, coaching, and financial education at the Point Community College Transfer Symposium in Los Angeles.

They settled the state of Pennsylvania. They are considered part of the historic core of the East Coast establishment, along with other wealthy families such as Boston Brahmins of Boston and The Four Hundred of New York City.See generally, Burt. These families were influential in the development and leadership of arts, culture, science, medicine, law, politics, industry and trade in the United States.

These families often have deeply established traditions in the Quaker and Episcopal faiths.Burt, p. 70-77. Many Old Philadelphia families intermarried and their descendants summer in Northeast Harbor, Desert Island, Maine. Many of these families trace their ancestries back to the original founders of Philadelphia while others entered into aristocracy during the nineteenth century with their profits from commerce and trade or by marrying into established Old Philadelphia families like the Cadwaladers and Biddles and Pitcairns.

She served primarily in the Caribbean, where she took a number of prizes, some after quite intensive action. Lark foundered off San Domingo in August 1809, with the loss of her captain and almost all her crew. French Revolutionary Wars Lark was commissioned in March 1794 under Commander Josias Rowley. Later that year Commander Francis Austen, who would go on to rise to the rank of admiral of the fleet, served on her when she was part of a fleet that evacuated British troops from Ostend and Nieuwpoort after the French captured the Netherlands. In 1795, the Lark was part of the squadron under Commodore Payne that escorted Princess Caroline of Brunswick to England. That same year she was part of the British naval force that supported the invasion of France by a force of French √©migr√©s. In January 1795 Commander William Ogilvy recommissioned her. On 21 March 1796, Lark joined the 32-gun frigate , Captain James Newman-Newman, in providing support to an unsuccessful attack by British troops from Port-au-Prince on the town and fort of L√©og√¢ne on the island of Hispaniola. Commander James Hayes was appointed captain of Lark in 1798. In late 1798 or early 1799, while on the Jamaica station, boats from the 98-gun second rate and Lark, under the temporary command of Lieutenant Hugh Cooke, cut out a schooner of four guns from Port Nieu in the West Indies. During this period, Lark, with HMS Jamaica captured two merchant vessels and destroyed one, and Lark alone destroyed another. In April 1799 Commander John Wentworth Loring took command. Lark then captured another schooner. Between 12 February and 21 May 1799, Lark captured two small privateers, a French schooner and a Spanish lateen-rigged vessel of one 6-pounder and two swivel guns, as well as seven merchant vessels. At some point between 26 June and October, Lark captured the American brig Sally, which was sailing from St. Thomas to Havana with 23 \\"new Negroes\\". Between 21 July and October Lark captured six more vessels: *Spanish schooner La Reyna Louisa, from Truxill bound to Havana, laden with nails, paint, white lime, leather, etc.; *Schooner Aurora, under American colours, from New York bound to Vera Cruz, laden with single sheet tin, pigs (ingots) of tin, dry goods, etc. (Spanish Property); *Ship America, under American colours, from Providence in America, to Havana, laden with salt; she had already landed part of her cargo at Turk's Island; *Schooner Betsy, under American colours, from Charleston bound to Havana, laden with sheet and pig lead; *Schooner Daphne, under American colours, from Philadelphia bound to Havana, laden with dry goods and iron work for sugar mills (Spanish property); and *Brig Mary, under American colours, from Baltimore bound to Vera Cruz, laden with dry goods (Spanish property). At some point after 27 October 1799 Lark captured three more vessels: *Spanish brig Nostra Senora de los Delores. She was of 140 tons, armed with four guns and had a crew of 30 men. She was from Havana bound to Vera Cruz with a cargo of cocoa. Lark was in company with and ; *Spanish brig Santo Domingo y San Juan Nepumaceno, taken off Cape Catouche. She was of 110 tons, armed with two guns, and had a crew of ten men. She was carrying a cargo of brandy, wine, oil, olives, and tin; *Spanish polacca Londre San Antonio de Padua, also taken off Cape Catouche. She was of 120 tons, armed with six guns, and had a crew of 18 men. She was carrying a cargo dry goods, brandy, wine, oil, olives, and tin. During the same period, Lark recaptured from a Spanish privateer an English sloop, laden with provisions. Between 9 and 20 March 1800, Lark took or destroyed six privateers and other small vessels. These included the French schooner Creole de Cuba, in ballast and destroyed on 9 March, a canoe loaded with timber taken on 14 March, the sloop Lively recaptured that same day, a French privateer destroyed on 15 March, a Spanish sloop in ballast, destroyed on 19 March, and a French schooner loaded with salt and taken on 20 March. The most intense action amongst these six captures occurred off Santiago de Cuba on 14 March when Loring saw a privateer schooner in a bay. He sent boats to bring her out but the enemy had established fortifications on the two heights that guarded the bay. From there, the enemy was able to repulse the attack, killing the lieutenant in command of the boats. Lark then put ashore a landing party some ten miles down the coast. This landing party marched up the coast and attacked the privateer from the rear with the result that when Loring led boats back into the bay he found the landing party had already captured the quarry. The privateer had two carriage guns and Loring destroyed her rather than bring her out. At some point during or after this, Lark captured or destroyed several more vessels. The list below may, but probably does not, overlap the list for the period 9 to 20 March. *French brig Voltigeur, which was carrying a cargo of coffee. She was armed with four guns and had a crew of 24 men. *French schooner Volante in ballast and destroyed; *French schooner Trompeuse taken while sailing from Jeremie to St. Jago (Santiago de Cuba) with a cargo of salt; *French schooner Trois Amis taken with a cargo of coffee; *French sloop of unknown name, taken in ballast; *French schooner of unknown name taken while sailing from Jeremie to St. Jago with a cargo of salt; *American schooner Freedom taken while sailing from Turk's Island to St. Jago with a cargo of salt; *Spanish sloop Fortune, taken while sailing from Porto Bello to Kingston with a cargo of cattle; *Spanish schooner Misericordia taken while sailing from Old Spain to St. Jago with a cargo of dry goods; *Two privateer barges; and *French sloop Hazard, which was in ballast and which Lark destroyed. While still on the Jamaica station under Vice-Admiral Lord Hugh Seymour, between 3 August and 3 January 1801 Lark captured three more merchant vessels: *French schooner of unknown name with a cargo of cattle; *Danish schooner Venus, of 35 tons with a cargo of coffee; and *American schooner Edward and Edmond, of 80 tons and laden with cocoa. During this period Lark capsized in a hurricane. The crew cut away her masts and rigging and she righted herself. She then had to be towed into Santo Domingo. Loring had her repaired and did so so expeditiously that Admiral Lord Hugh Seymour appointed him as acting captain of , which had just arrived with her crew in a demoralized and mutinous state. In May 1801, Lark was under the command of Commander James Katon (pro tem). Lark's next action occurred on 13 September 1801. With Lieutenant James Johnstone as acting captain, Lark chased a Spanish privateer schooner along the coast of Cuba until evening, when the schooner took refuge within the Portillo Reefs. Johnstone sent his yawl and cutter, each with sixteen men, including officers, to capture her. The privateer, which was armed with a long 8-pounder and two 4-pounders, opened fire on the boarding party. Still, the British prevailed, though they lost one man killed and a midshipman and 12 sailors wounded. The Spanish lost 21 dead, including their captain Joseph Callie, and six wounded; Lark took the remainder of the 45 man crew prisoner. The privateer was the Esperanza out of Santiago, and in the previous month she had taken the British sloop Eliza and the brig Betsey. In April 1802 Edward Pelham Brenton took command. In July James Tippet may have been appointed to command, but on 4 July Lark left Jamaica for England. On 15 August, two days before she reached Plymouth, Lark encountered the brig Jane. Jane had apparently run out of food and water so Brenton provided her with some.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 8, p.174. After reaching Plymouth, Lark sailed the next day to Woolwich to be paid off. Napoleonic Wars On 31 May 1803 Lark was under the command of John Tower when she captured the French ship Marianne. On 11 April 1804 there was an announcement that when Lark next arrived at Deal that the prize agents would disburse a distribution of ¬£5000 in prize money to those of her captain and crew who had participated in the capture. There was a second disbursement of ¬£1759 in 1804. Lark also shared part of the proceeds of the capture with the English privateers Star and Polecat.Polecat was a lugger of 25 tons, armed with two swivel guns and with a crew of six. Her master was John Thomson and her Letter of Marque was dated 26 November 1803. Star was a lugger of 28 tons, armed with two 1-pounder carriage guns and two swivel guns. She had a crew of ten men, under the command of Richard Mowell. Her Letter of Marque was dated 28 May 1803. In May 1804 Lark was under the command of Fredrick Langford who in January 1805 took Lark from Portsmouth, headed for West Africa. In late January or early February he found a Spanish merchant vessel at anchor off the Bay of Senegal and captured her. She was the schooner Camerara, with two guns, though she was pierced for 16, and was carrying a cargo of wine. The Camerara was formerly French and had been a successful privateer at Cayenne under the ownership of Victor Hughes. The Governor of Senegal had intended to present her to her former captain, Victor Hughes, with the aim of using her to harass British trade on this part of the coast of Africa. On 29 May 1805 Lark was in company with off the coast of Guinea when they captured the French merchant brigantine Cecile. Towards the end of 1806, Lark was escorting six merchantmen from Gor√©e when by the Savage Islands she came upon a French squadron consisting of five sail of the line, three frigates, a raz√©e and two brig- corvettes. The convoy dispersed and Lark was able to escape and made her way to Cadiz to alert the British fleet there. Lark reached Cadiz on 26 November, and Rear Admiral Sir John Thomas Duckworth immediately took his squadron to try to find the French. The French squadron, under Contre-Admiral Allemand, was part of a French break-out from Brest.James(1837), Vol. 4, p.187. Lark went on to Portsmouth. She then left Portsmouth under the command of Commander Robert Nicholas, bound for the West Indies. On the way, on 19 January 1807, she set off in pursuit of a Spanish schooner. Unfortunately, the schooner was carrying so much sail that a squall capsized her; Lark could not reach the spot where she went down before the schooner's entire crew had already drowned. Later that January, on the 27th, and after a 14-hour pursuit, Lark captured two Spanish guarda costa (coast guard) vessels sailing from Cartagena to Portobelo. The two vessels were the Postillon (one long 12-pounder gun, two six-pounders, and 76 men), and the Carmen (one 12-pounder, four six pounders, and 72 men). On 4 February Lark was still in company with the two guarda costas when they encountered two gunboats and an armed schooner escorting a Spanish convoy of several small market boats. Lark was able to drive the vessels of the convoy ashore, but the escorts took refuge under the guns of a 4-gun battery in a creek in Bahia Cispata, Colombia. Lark silenced the battery. Nicholas then took his entire crew, less the 20 men he left to guard the two guarda costas, and put them in boats with the aim of capturing the gunboats and the armed schooner. The Spanish gunboats rowed towards the British boats but then retreated as the British drew nearer. Nicholas and three of his men then were wounded while they were capturing the rearmost vessel, a gun boat with one 24-pounder and two 6-pounder guns. Later, Lark had three more men wounded in the continuing action. Nicholas then attempted to pursue the remaining Spanish vessels up a creek but while he was trying to do so, the pilot ran Postillon and Carmen ashore. This forced Nicholas to order their prize crews to burn them, which they did. Postillion blew up and Carmen was solidly aflame when the British last saw her. On 23 August, Lark, in the company of the Cruizer class brig sloop HMS Ferret, captured the French privateer schooner Mosquito, out of Santo Domingo. She had eight guns and a crew of 58 men. In 1807, Nicholas became lieutenant governor of Cura√ßao shortly after the British captured it. When he left, the merchants there gave him a silver plate in appreciation for his efforts in protection of their trade. In the summer of 1809, Lark participated in the blockade of San Domingo until the city fell on 11 July to Spanish forces and the British under Hugh Lyle Carmichael. The blockading squadron, under Captain William Pryce Cumby in the 64-gun third rate , also included , , , , , , and . Payment of prize money occurred in January 1826 and October 1832. Loss On 3 August 1809, Lark foundered in a gale off Cape Causada (Point Palenqua), San Domingo. She was at anchor when the gale struck. She set sail at daybreak to get out to sea but while she was shortening sail a squall struck that turned her on her side. At that point a heavy sea struck her and she filled rapidly with water. She sank within 15 minutes, taking most of her crew with her. Some of her crew survived by hanging on to floating wreckage. However, by evening, when the Cruizer- class brig-sloop arrived, Commander Nicholas and all but three men of her crew of 120 were dead. Moselle then rescued the three survivors. Nicholas had just been promoted to post-captain with orders to command . Notes, citations, and references Notes Citations References *Colledge, J.J.

Benjamin Harrison IV (1693 ‚Äì July 12, 1745) was an American Virginia planter, politician, and Member of the Virginia House of Burgesses. He was the son of Benjamin Harrison III and the father of Benjamin Harrison V, who was a signer of the Declaration of Independence and the fifth governor of Virginia. Harrison built the homestead of Berkeley Plantation, which is believed to be the oldest three-story brick mansion in Virginia and is the ancestral home to two presidents: his grandson William Henry Harrison, and his great-great- grandson Benjamin Harrison. The Harrison family and the Carter family were both powerful families in Virginia, and they were united when Harrison married Anne Carter, the daughter of Robert \\"King\\" Carter. His family also forged ties to the Randolph family, as four of his children married four grandchildren of William Randolph I. Biography Benjamin Harrison IV was born in a small house on the plantation named \\"Berkeley Hundred\\" or \\"Berkeley Plantation\\". He completed his studies at The College of William & Mary and became the family's first college graduate. He settled on his family estate and increased his land holdings, as his ancestors had done. Around 1722, Harrison married Anne Carter, whom William Byrd II described as \\"a very agreeable girl\\", and he managed and received profits from her father's land as part of her dowry. Carter entailed this land to Harrison's son Carter Henry Harrison. Harrison built a Georgian-style three-story brick mansion on a hill overlooking the James River in 1726 using bricks that were fired on the plantation. Berkeley has a distinction shared only with Peacefield in Quincy, Massachusetts, as the ancestral home of two presidents. In 1729, Harrison purchased 200 acres of the Bradford plantation from Richard Bradford III. From 1736 to 1742, he represented Charles City County, Virginia in the House of Burgesses. Harrison and his wife had 11 children: *Elizabeth (born ~1723) married Peyton Randolph, the son of Sir John Randolph, the grandson of William Randolph I, and the first President of the Continental Congress. *Anne (born ~1724) married William Randolph III, the son of William Randolph II and the grandson of William Randolph I, and had eight surviving children. Her descendants include Captain Kidder Breese. *Benjamin (born ~1726) married Elizabeth Bassett. His third son was President William Henry Harrison.

In 1760, he married Mary Ruffin, daughter of Edmund Ruffin and they had four children. He married Anne Gilliam in 1768 and they had six children. His descendants include J. Hartwell Harrison. Harrison in 1745 was struck by lightning and killed, with one daughter, Hannah. Some reports incorrectly say his \\"two youngest daughters\\" were killed in 1745 when lightning struck his house. Harrison's will expressed his intent to be buried near his son Henry, and it broke with the British tradition of primogeniture by leaving large amounts of wealth to all of his children. His oldest son Benjamin became responsible for the six plantations that comprised Berkeley, along with the manor house, equipment, stock, and slaves. Eight other plantations were divided among the remaining sons, and his daughters were given cash and slaves. One source indicates that Harrison's tomb is located on the grounds of the \\"old Westover Church\\", but another states that he was buried in his family's cemetery.

The film is based on the 1990 play of the same name by David Stevens, who also wrote. The film stars Russell Crowe and Jack Thompson. The screen adaptation mimics the play's device of breaking the fourth wall with direct to camera conversational asides by both Harry and Jeff. Plot Widower Harry Mitchell (Thompson) lives with his gay son Jeff (Crowe), with both men struggling in their searches for true love. Harry is completely comfortable with his son's sexuality, and is almost over-eager in his support for his son's search for a boyfriend. Harry meets an attractive but judgmental divorcee through a dating service, and this leads to some conflict between the two main characters. However, when Harry suffers a stroke and loses the power of speech, the story takes a darker turn, becoming a meditation on the enduring strength of love, both familial and romantic, in the face of adversity.

Borophagus secundus existed for approximately .PaleoBiology Database: Borophagus secundus, basic info Overview Borophagus secundus, like other Borophaginae, are loosely known as \\"bone-crushing\\" or \\"hyena-like\\" dogs. Though not the most massive borophagine by size or weight, it had a more highly evolved capacity to crunch bone than earlier, larger genera such as Epicyon, which seems to be an evolutionary trend of the group (Turner, 2004). During the Pliocene epoch, Borophagus began being displaced by Canis genera such as Canis edwardii. Early species of Borophagus were placed in the genus Osteoborus until recently, but the genera are now considered synonyms. Taxonomy Like other members of its genus, B. secundus had a bulging forehead and powerful jaws; it was considered to be probably a scavenger by paleontologists in the past. Its crushing premolar teeth and strong jaw muscles would have been used to crack open bone, much like the hyena of the Old World. However, B. secundus fossils are so abundant and geographically widespread that some paleontologists now argue that it must have been the dominant carnivore of its time, and thus an active predator because carrion feeding alone could not have sustained such a large population.Wang, Xiaoming; and Tedford, Richard H. Dogs: Their Fossil Relatives and Evolutionary History. New York: Columbia University Press, 2008. pp112-3 They note that not all carnivores with bone-cracking ability are scavengers, such as the modern spotted hyena; instead, they interpret the bone-cracking ability as an adaptation to social hunting where complete utilization of a carcass was favored. The adult animal is estimated to have been about 80 cm in length, similar to a coyote, although it was much more powerfully built. Fossil distribution Borophagus secundus fossil specimens are very widespread from Honduras and El Salvador to central Mexico, Oklahoma panhandle, central and southern California, Nebraska, Kansas, and northern New Mexico.

History  As Montauk, the ship worked primarily near Japan and Korea. Originally called the Bitten Theresa, construction on the ship began on 28 February 1998, when its keel was laid in Tuzla, Istanbul, Turkey. The ship was built by the Turkish company Gemak Shipbuilding Industry and Trading S.A.Priolo, 2004. The build was finished in 1999, and in 2000, the American company Sealift Incorporated purchased the vessel, registered it under the United States flag, and renamed it Montauk. On 27 November 2000 the vessel was awarded a long-term charter by the US Navy Military Sealift Command. This charter, previously held by T-1 tanker MV Valiant,Military Sealift Command, Annual Report, 2000. was a $10,751,304 firm fixed-price contract with reimbursables. The hire made Montauk one of two tankers under long-term charter to MSC at the time, and put Montauk under control of the Defense Energy Support Center, which procures fuel for U.S. military operations worldwide. Options in the contract brought its estimated cumulative value to $27,730,162. Military Sealift Command solicited more than 120 proposals for the charter and received five offers.

He grew up exploring the woods around his New Jersey home under the guidance of his mother. With her inspiration, Mulford grew up making his own small gardens with the wild plants that he had gathered. He eventually started collecting snakes, lizards and other reptiles whenever he could. He attended school and graduated in 1905 as salutatorian from Elmer High School spending his free time out of doors.Personal interviews with Foster family members/taken from personal diaries of Mulford and Racine Foster which includes interpretations of all art work, dates of travel to Europe and South America, memories of historical eventSpencer, Michael.

Sept 5, 1975, Section D Professional career=Banker/Editor= Mulford's father encouraged him to become educated in business, being concerned that his love of nature would not be profitable. To satisfy this urging, he attended and graduated from a Philadelphia business school. He worked for 5 years in the top 2 Philadelphia banks during this training and in the year following graduation. In 1910 he decided to leave Philadelphia and took a job with his father's newspaper as Associate Editor back in Elmer, NJ. but within a year, he was back in Philadelphia. =Naturalist/Lecturer= Mulford demonstrating safety of snakes during one of many public lectures. After his 1911 marriage he and his wife purchased land north of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania at Cold Springs. It was a large tract of land. Mulford and Fridel lived in a multi-story home with the basement and an outbuilding devoted to his snakes. It was remote, connected to services only by a train with a depot near their house and walking path. He had plans of refurbishing one of the old farmhouses on the property although this never transpired. According to historians the farmhouse likely burned down sometime in 1919 and the family left Cold Springs sometime after this. During his years at Cold Springs Mulford kept busy on the property developing the former hotel grounds, growing an orchard, raising fruits and vegetables, his reptiles and squab as well as involved in some fashion with the bottling and selling of the spring water which came from underground sources. In Mulford's time, the collected spring water and squab would eventually find their way to tables as far away as Harrisburg and Philadelphia. Additional information has been collected on the Cold Springs inhabitants of the early 1900s including the Fosters and can be found in the book Cold Spring Hotel Site.Logan, James C and James M Logan. \\"Cold Spring Hotel Site\\". Lebanon, PA LCHS 2005> Mulford also worked elsewhere for extra money. He worked as a camp Naturalist and instructor for Camp Kenebec in Maine where he would go in mid- summer. In the winter he lectured to schools, colleges and Boy Scout groups as well as the YMCA. He was already renowned as both a Naturalist and lecturer. The New Jersey State Board of Agriculture had realized the value of his work and arranged to send him on a lecture tour around the state to discuss the value of snakes, lizards and turtles at the Farmer's Institutes held at the various counties during the winter shortly after his marriage.Numerous newspaper clippings from 1911 to 1912 He was known to many as the \\"Snake Man\\" having specialized in the reptiles and for that matter all forms of nature for many years. He was a charismatic speaker and always pleased his audiences with his enthusiasm and accentuation of humorous and interesting facts. Newspaper articles stated that he had in his possession the largest private collection of living reptiles in the state. Mulford's brochure advertising his nature lectures. Between the years of 1908-1918 he enjoyed the great influence of Elbert Hubbard. Hubbard, a writer and publisher of east Aurora, N.Y. had established a philosophical society which coincided with the developing philosophy held by Mulford. He was invited to lecture in New York on the top of snakes. The presentation earned him much favorable publicity because he had live snakes on stage with him. During the presentation they coiled around his neck, found refuge in his pockets or slid inside his shirt against his warm body. His motive was to teach the audience understanding and acceptance toward snakes. He lectured in many eastern cities and Mulford received publicity from Elbert in several ways, even having him write the chapter called \\"Just Snakes\\" in one of his books called So Here Then Cometh Pig-pen Pete; Or, Some Chums of Mine.Hubbard, Elbert. \\"Just Snakes\\". So Here Then Cometh Pig-pen Pete; Or, Some Chums of Mine. The Roycrofters, 1914. 131-140 While living in Cold Springs he maintained a friendship with another writer Conrad Richter. Conrad and his wife lived in Pine Grove, Pennsylvania, which was a nearby town. Letters between the two as well as pictures in possession of the family reflect a close camaraderie. Conrad once wrote \\"If anyone has a unique paradise of his own on earth, that one is Mulford Foster, Master of one of the prettiest and wildest valleys in Pennsylvania, he has on his immense primeval estate a limpid lake where wood creatures come down to drink, a magic winding little river for his silent canoe, a collection of almost every variety of domestic animal and bird, pet skunks, several dozen kinds of tamed snakes, wild flowers, trees and shrubs and a million wild creatures that have flocked to his place from the mountains about because they know that no harm can come to them here, and Foster attired in brown flannel and stealing noiselessly through the woods with the light foot and deftness of a Mohican, is all day long and often at evening out among them.\\".Foster, Mulford. \\"My Forest Folk in Virgin Valley: A Romance of the Great-Out of Doors\\". (a lecture series advertisement with quotations from his well-known friends including Conrad Richter, Elbert Hubbard, etc. The date is approximately 1912 with exact date of publication unknown-original in possession of family) In 1918 an opportunity presented itself that intrigued him with a training course offered by the Davy Tree Expert company in Kent, Ohio. Since he already had an affinity with trees it was a simple step to learn how to sell tree service to the people who had large estates in the area of Baltimore, Washington and Virginia. He remained the Davy company representative of these three states during the years 1918-1923. =Landscape Architect= While working for the Davy Tree Company he began entertaining the idea of changing professions and with his prior passion for growing and designing gardens in his youth, he liked the prospect of becoming a landscape architect. He bought as many books on the subject and began teaching himself the art. In 1923 he moved his family to Florida and began establishing himself as a well-respected landscaper, first in Palm Beach where he was in charge of landscape design with Exotic Gardens, then moving to Orlando, Florida. Many Orlando businesses and estates have Mulford's artistic mark on them still present to this day. A few of the important landscape projects done between 1925 and 1958 include Lancaster Park, a subdivision in Orlando, FL (1925); the ranch house grounds for Horseshoe Ranch, a ranch on the Kissimmee River, Florida (1925); the Episcopal Cathedral Church of St Luke downtown Orlando (1925) where he provided the original landscape design (with his son Bert revamping the historic church in 1987); Poinsettia Park in Winter Haven, FL (1926); Ivanhoe Shores, subdivision in Orlando, Fl (1926); Azalea Park, Orlando, FL (1935); The Herlong Estate in Leesburg, FL (1938); The Orlando Garden Club, Orlando, FL (1958); the Floating Islands at Leesburg, FL (1953‚Äì1958) during which Foster moved a six trunk date palm from 718 Magnolia to Leesburg. He won a design award for this project in 1953. Photographs and news clippings of his accomplishments are among the records at UCF; a large interior tropical garden at the American Mutual Liability Insurance Company, Wakefield, Massachusetts (1957) as well as designed and supervised planting of the grounds of the Clarkstown Country Club, Nyack, NY (1932‚Äì1934) and Marine Studios at Marineland, Florida (1937‚Äì1938) where he supervised the planting and rock gardens as well as working directly with the building and architects, as well as the engineer. Records relating to this project including photographs of the actual landscaping in progress along with the completed project and original brochure can be found among the UCF collection. =Artist/Photographer= When discussing his artistic career at age 86 he reminisced that he never intended to be an artist. His wife reported to the newspaper interviewer that \\"it just welled up out of him\\". Mulford recalled that his first paintings were done on frosted windowpanes in New Jersey. Then in his early twenties he started experimenting with photography. This led directly into his early formal painting. A Graflex camera became his constant companion on field trips exploring for snakes, the primary subject on his film of those early days. It was at this time that he inevitably he saw the wildflowers in fields and forests. He experienced the light and shadow of the open and sheltered places. He wasn't able to always capture what he saw and felt on film. He eventually found the answer in painting. Once he lived in Florida he began taking photos of large estates including their grounds, their gardens, their specimen plants, the vistas as seen through their gates and sold them for extra income. The owners often voiced the thought that they wished they could be in color as these were the days before color film or digital cameras. To add color he used cotton twisted on a toothpick dipped in paint. In tinting he had to get acquainted with artist oils. He saw details of leaves and bark. He saw the natural arrangements of branches and trunks and this made him think about structure. Soon he had made the step from shading photographs to actual painting. His first painting was a canvas of a garden scene with a wall and large vases. It was hung in a Baltimore Show. From that painting forward he made time to paint. It was realistic work, always of plants. His early paintings in 1923 were categorized as \\"Photographic\\". From there he began painting his series labeled \\"Realistic\\" paintings from 1925 to 1928. An unknown artist friend looked at one of his early efforts and made the comment that he did not have to paint every leaf. The period of details however survived until 1928 when the paintings became more stylized under the tutelage of Leopold Stokowski. This experience came about when Stokowski, a long-time friend of Mrs. Bovington, then employing Mulford as a landscape architect for her estate, told her he was looking for someone to accompany the family to Europe. Knowing the two individuals, she immediately recommended Mulford who accepted eagerly. Stokowski took him to Switzerland, France and Italy where they spent most of the summer of 1928 in the Alps.Rand, Sumner. \\"Stokowski, area horticulturist developed special friendship\\", Sentinel Star, Sept. 15, 1977, p. 2-B Stokowski was eager to see Europe through Mulford's eyes. He viewed life in a different way than Stokowski had experienced before. It was Mulford's great pleasure to explain plant life from his philosophical point of view. Stokowski was the disciplinarian for Mulford. He required a painting every day from him. It was almost by the demand of Stokowski that Mulford created over forty impressions of his experience that summer, the major portions being the French Alps in and around Haute Savoir. These paintings were compiled in a book Stokowski Sees that was privately printed but not published and the book is currently held by Michael Spencer who is still deciding on its future, although many drawings and paintings are held by family members from this era and his memories are recollected in memoir accounts. After his return from Europe he continued to paint with his newfound skills and outlook. Between the years 1928-1932 he painted a group of paintings he called \\"Stylized\\". In his Orange Grove painting he used familiar motifs in a highly stylized rendition of orange groves found everywhere at the time in Florida. The round form of the orange tree mimicked by the round oranges themselves broken up by the lines of palm fronds, fences and crates. The lake is repeating the line of the arched trunk hanging over it. The grouping of leaves each is repeating cleverly the whole form of the lake. The ornamental form of Euphorbias was a persistent stimulus which produced three important paintings. In one, Euphorbia expressed a freer flowing style with its long undulating branches waving as a Bali dancer would, leading to the creation of The Dancers. In fact the Bali mask in the painting suggests a comparison. The very young Bali girls perform their ceremonial dances by undulating motion of the arms rather than of the feet or body. Mulford tried to show that the plant does the same thing in ten years what the Bali dancer can do in ten minutes. The motion of the plant is solidified and has the duration of many years, while the dance of the little girl is observed in but a fleeting glimpse of each movement. It is a unity of life's expressions with each form finding its happiness in expressing its rhythm within the limits of its timing. Another painting, Polynesian took as its pivot the five points of a talkative Stapelia whose form symbolizes heaven and sun. The pattern of the plant was echoed in the Polynesian tapa cloth which was the inspiration for the painting and is seen in the background. The angular Padilanthus was used as well to compose symphony of harmonious form. The idea of the painting was to build a symphonic interpretation of these motifs from their original primitive representations, reappearing again in living form. The few simple motifs are found repeated in each object with a natural simplicity which the artist has caught and tried to reproduce. Between the years 1930 and 1935 Mulford's paintings took on a combination of stylized and decorative style. The \\"Philosophical\\" series was started between 1932 and 1936. In Self Defense, every living thing has its own protection. This begins with the flowering date palm and its maze of thousand spikes or thorns pointing in every direction guarding reproduction from conception to maturing of egg cells that we call seeds or fruit. After this painting was completed, Mulford made a frame to hold it but immediately the frame seemed to defeat the purpose of the expression to be illustrated. The palm was confined. This led to painting the fronds on the frame, extending them up and out of the frame. He helped develop the Nyack Country Club in New York between the years 1932-1934. He used elephants to move and plow the dirt. Being the sensitive man that he was he observed that each elephant had his own personality and it was reflected in their eyes. His elephant painting reflects this insight. In Mimicry the artist sympathetically depicts the parallel relationship between one of the lizard's mannerisms and that of the Anthurium. The little tendrils and feet of the lowest white leaved vine compared to the little feet of the lizard. The appearance is very much the same. The leaves and flower in the painting represents the family Aracae, of which the calla lily is a member. They are among the earliest and simplest forms of plants. The lizard as well is a very early and simple form of the reptiles. The painting is filled with subtle repetitions with colors suggesting a deep primeval forest with its many hidden forms. He described the motivation behind the Climbers. It had been motivated by a huge, old, gnarled vine growing outside his studio at Tropical Arts. The vine in his painting climbs up the tree trunk for light and air. A small tendril is the intelligence part of the vine. It is the guide for its motivation. Likewise the small tender tongue of the snake is the sensitive ear and nose which guide the snake to quiet resting places. The parallel means of motivation of these two forms create the similar shape of their bodies and a similar type of intelligence. The vine and snake are both elemental and early forms of life, assembled in harmonious composition in this painting. His series Impressions of Mexico was completed between 1936 and 1938. By 1936 he was almost entirely painting on wood such a flat application of oil paint that even artists asked him if he painted in tempera. He had painted on canvas but with the painting of his plant subjects he felt closer to the earth if he worked on wood. One medium that he used and was very skilled was painting in oil on rice pith. This is very thin, like tissue paper although not paper at all but rather the pith of the rice plant cut under water by the Japanese. So deft was his use of oil on this transparent, lighter than air substance that there were often accusations that it surely could not be done with oil. The Japanese frequently used tempera on rice pith so everyone assumed he was using it as well. While Mulford was exploring South America, he initially would paint his renditions of the plants that he and Racine had collected including the flowers and fruit found. In the beginning he used oils which meant carrying around the tubes of paint as well as having to let the pictures dry each night. In South America this had its disadvantages when the weather was wet or temperatures too cold to allow the oil paintings to dry. He subsequently went to colored pencils which eliminated the need for drying, could be done quickly and simplified the supplies he needed to carry around. During the decades of the 1950s and 1960s while much of Mulford's time was spent exploring, collecting, writing, cultivating, and designing yards he also managed to paint. His final painting series was called Synthesis and was completed over the years 1950-1966. He continued to do sketches and smaller works but Palm Family, Orchid Family and Cactus Family were his last serious paintings. It is this last series that prompted the name \\"passionate plant lover\\". He ultimately held a showing at the Art Center of Maitland in September 1975 exhibiting all his paintings including all the series from the Photographic to the Synthesis. The Foster estate donated Mulford's last series of paintings to the Harry P. Leu Gardens where they are part of a permanent art exhibit. =Horticulturist/hybridizer= Mulford had the reputation of being the first hybridizer of the great self-heading philodendron after bringing it to the US in 1940 and as a hybridizer had extensive demands to maintain.Mulford and Other Legends to Recall.\\" Bromeliad Society of San Francisco. Newsletter. Oct 2004. 2-4 In 1951 he received the Herbert Medal for his work and discoveries in amaryllis. In 1962 he received a citation from the American Horticultural Society Congress for contributions to the knowledge of bromeliads. He has more than forty notable crosses of bromeliads and amaryllids. The principal bromeliads that were hybridized were confined to the billbergia and vrieseas subfamilies. One popular hybrid was the Billbergia 'Muriel Waterman' (Billbergia horrida var. tigrina which he crossed in 1946 and it first flowered in 1950. He had significant influence in the world of bromeliad growers and popularized the use of the term \\"pups\\" for naming the offshoots of bromeliads. He ran the Tropical Arts Nursery in Orlando, Florida located at 718 N. Magnolia on the corner of Magnolia and Colonial Drive along with the Latch String tea room and his art studio between the years 1924-1957. The business of growing and cultivating his plants took hours of his time. In 1953 he and his wife, Racine purchased of property north of town and named it \\"Bromel-La\\" and 6 years later their house was built and they moved on to the land. He had two greenhouses built each 30 X . The property would be a showcase and sanctuary of plants that had been both collected as well as his hybrid bromeliads during the 20 years that he and Racine owned the land. It had been hoped that after his death the property would remain a safe haven for bromeliads but the monies for this purpose were never raised and it was sold to private sources. =Explorer and Collector= First page of Brazil, Orchids of the Tropics Mulford began traveling to Mexico in 1935 taking his first trip with Tibor Pataky, an artist friend. This trip was written about in his book Adventures in Mexico.Foster, Mulford and Racine Foster. \\"Adventures in Mexico'. 1935 He returned with Racine, his second wife in 1936 and began making frequent trips to South America over the next twenty years. Mulford had a great interest in finding both new and old species of plants that could be used as both indoor decorations and landscape material. In 1938 Mulford made a Cuban expedition and from this trip he introduced Agave caribbea to Florida. Around this same time Mulford met Lyman Smith who was working at Harvard's Gray Herbarium, being referred to him by sources in the Smithsonian. Lyman ultimately would be of help with the identification and classification of the bromeliads that Mulford would be collecting. It is Lyman Smith who directed him to Brazil as he had himself been there and collected specimens. Mulford had initially expressed an interest in exploring Dutch Guiana Mulford's and Racine's book Brazil, Orchid of the Tropics, a long out of print book but available through used sources was a well told story of their 1940 trip to Brazil.Foster, Mulford and Racine Foster. \\"Brazil, Orchid of the Tropics\\". Jaques Cattell Press, Lancaster PA, USA, 1945 The book was a success and its completion brought the artful teamwork that was to mark the relationship between Racine and Mulford. His keen vision, liveliness and resourcefulness balanced with her devotion and help in caring for all of the plants and helping organize his materials, keep fastidious notes of her own were replicated many times over the years with many projects. In 1939 Mulford set off to Brazil again for six months covering much better known areas than their previous trip. Mulford was again able to find new species in places that were supposedly already previously explored and declared exhausted by prior collectors over the previous one hundred and fifty years. Mulford recollected a number of \\"lost\\" species during his trips to Brazil. He introduced the brilliant yellow flowering tree, Tabebuia umbellate to North America. This tree is now famous in Orlando, Florida. In 1940 he made his second six month expedition to Brazil and Trinidad this time specializing on bromeliads, orchids and philodendrons. From this trip he introduced many new bromeliads and the now famous self-heading philodendrons. World War II put a stop to further expeditions for some years. Mulford turned his attention to cultivating and popularizing the bromeliads. He continued to work with Lyman Smith who continued to describe and identify the bromeliads that had been brought back from Brazil in the preceding years. In 1946 Mulford resumed his expeditions. From Brazil he brought back the begonia acetosa and introduced it to US gardeners.Tebbett, Mark. \\"Begonias: Cultivation, Identification, and Natural History\\", p 75. Timber Press, Incorporated; October 15, 2005 He and Racine also traveled to Columbia. This trip followed the earlier trail of the famous √âdouard Andr√© to confirm and add to his discoveries 75 years before. These were considered one of the most important bromeliad areas of Latin America. In 1948 he made a plant expedition around South America collecting in Dutch Guiana, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia Costa Rica, Cuba, Puerto Rico and Trinidad. Several years later in 1951 he would leave on a Venezuelan plant expedition. This was followed in 1954 to Jamaica with his final plant collecting trip made to Mexico in 1957. During these trips Mulford not only collected thousands of herbarium specimens for the Gray Herbarium of Harvard University and the Smithsonian Institution of Washington, DC where all of the scientific data is now on file but he also collected thousands of seeds and live plants to enrich the variety for Florida gardens. The following is a list of the various South American locations that Mulford was known to have traveled for plants outside the U.S., frequently with his wife Racine at his side. The process of collecting and preserving the specimens was rigorous and well documented in existing records. Aechmea orlandiana is one of the new species discovered by Mulford in Brazil and named after his home town of Orlando, Florida. *Brazil *Peru *Bolivia *Ecuador *Panama *Costa Rica *Mexico *Puerto Rico *Colombia *Dutch Guiana *Cuba *Jamaica *Venezuela *Trinidad =New Species of Plants Collected= The following species of plants are taken from the Foster's book Brazil, Orchid of the Tropics, the Gray's Herbarium at Harvard University and the Smithsonian Institution's Department of Botany. As the number of new species found and collected from South America by Mulford is estimated to be between 170 and perhaps over 200 this list is currently incomplete. Other names can be found in the Institute of Botany in Brazil although few new species are in that location.

He lectured on garden and natural history subjects to colleges, universities, schools and garden clubs throughout the United States as well as in Venezuela, Costa Rica and Canada. He wrote quite a bit as well. His earliest writings came in the form of letters which were abundant even at an early age. Some were simple postcards, acknowledgments of his thoughts and yet now providing glimpses into his inner self and a road map to his outward activities. His letters were often either quite humorous or poetic prose although he also wrote poetry which he would use occasionally to adorn Christmas cards and the like. In the later years, after his move to Florida it was typical that you could find them scribbled on his Tropical Arts letterhead paper. Beginning in the 1940s Mulford along with Racine began publishing their ever-expanding bromeliad knowledge in a wide variety of garden and horticultural publications. These ranged from well-known venues such as The Smithsonian, The New York Times, and House Beautiful to trade journals such as the National Horticultural Magazine and Cactus and Succulent Journal to name just a few. A special article called \\"Puya, the Pineapple's Andean Ancestor\\" was published in the October 1950 National Geographic Magazine along with color photos.Foster, Mulford. \\"Puya, the Pineapple's Andean Ancestor\\". National Geographic Magazine. October 1950 It was also during this time that they began writing their collaborative books based on travels to South America including Brazil, Orchid of the Tropics, Bromeliads-A Cultural Handbook and Air Gardens of BrazilFoster, Mulford and Racine Foster. \\"Bromeliads-A Cultural Handbook\\". Bromeliad Society, Oct 1945 Mulford also became the founder and President of the Bromeliad Society in 1950 through 1959 and became its editor from 1951 through 1958 Padilla, Victoria. \\"Mulford B. Foster\\". Journal of the Bromeliad Society, 1978. Vol 28, #6, pg 243-244 and with his editorship of the Bulletin his audience became worldwide. He wrote numerous pieces for the Bromeliad Journal International which can be found in their archives with an examples frequently seen in reprints even today. He maintained this responsibility for over a decade with Racine acting a copy editor for years. Both were heavily committed to this publication at the beginning, often using their own monies to help publish the journal in the early years.A Historical Note: Mulford Foster 1889-1978.\\" Bromeliad Society of Broward County.

A listing of magazine and books written and published from 1938 to 1945 =List of published works= The following publications by Mulford B Foster are discussed in this article. A more complete list of his publications may be found at      Personal life  Mulford was married twice. His first wife was Fridel Tautenhahn whom he married Nov 1911 in Philadelphia.Marriage Records: State of Pennsylvania 1911 It was felt by some that his intense relationship with her father led to this marriage. They had 4 children, Gerda (1912), Bert (1919), Miriam (1920) and then twins with only one daughter Jeanne Eunice surviving (in 1922). They divorced in 1933 in FloridaMarriage Records: (Divorce) State of Florida 1933 although the children remained nearby with their mother. He married Racine Sarasy in 1935Marriage Records: State of Florida 1935 becoming Racine Foster for whom the bromeliad genus Racinaea was named after. There were no children from this marriage. He had numerous grandchildren and great grandchildren as well as a large extended family around him throughout the latter part of his life. In 1974 Mulford experienced a devastating cerebrovascular accident leaving him paralyzed on one side and almost always using a wheelchair. Despite the paralysis, he continued to sketch with his good hand. He had a series of smaller strokes over the next four years before ultimately dying at his home in 1978. Following his death a memorial fund was established at the Marie Selby Botanical Gardens. The Mulford B. Foster Identification Center was established which remains to this day with the intent on furthering interest and study of the bromeliad.

Later based in Germany, he belonged to a group of writers that included the likes of Hans Grimm, Rudolf G. Binding, Emil Strau√ü, Agnes Miegel and Hanns Johst, all of whom found favour under the Nazis.Raymond Furness, The twentieth century, 1890-1945, 1978, p. 255 He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature five times.  Early life  A Volksdeutscher from the Hungarian part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, he attended school in Budapest before furthering his education in Karlsbad and Vienna.Robert S. Wistrich, Who's Who in Nazi Germany, 2001, p. 144 Kolbenheyer studied philosophy, psychology and zoology at the University of Vienna and earned his PhD in 1905. He became a freelance writer and came to specialise in historical novels that were characterised by their fixation with all things German. In 1908 he published Amor Dei, a novel about life and thinking of the Jewish-Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza, which made Kolbenheyer fairly known. Kolbenheyer published an anthology with own poetry under the title Der Dornbusch brennt (i.e. Burning bush) in 1922. Between 1917 and 1925 he produced his most celebrated works, a trilogy of novels about Paracelsus, and in these books Kolbenheyer explored many of the V√∂lkisch movement concepts prevalent at the time by presenting his hero as the Nordic race archetype struggling against racial degeneracy and immorality.Andrew Weeks, Paracelsus, 1997, pp. 25-6 In 1929 he published ‚ÄûHeroische Leidenschaften‚Äú (i.e. Heroic Passions), a drama about the Italian astronomer Giordano Bruno. Having settled amongst the Sudeten Germans, Kolbenheyer's right-wing attitudes solidified and he came to pre-empt many ideas of Nazism, notably in his theoretical work Die Bauh√ºtte (1925), which predicted a turn away from 'Judeo-Christianity' as the source of German salvation. This work has been identified as being one of the main influences on Alfred Rosenberg's The Myth of the Twentieth Century.Klaus P. Fischer, Nazi Germany: A New History, London, 1996, p. 369 In Kolbenheyer's own words the addressee of his book \\"Bauh√ºtte\\" is the \\"philosophical conscience ... of the white race\\" which he wanted to arouse.Christian J√§ger, Minorit√§re Literatur: Das Konzept der Kleinen Literatur am Beispiel Prager- und Sudetendeutscher Werke, Deutscher Universitats-Verlag, 2005, , p. 158; Kolbenheyer: \\"weltanschauliche Gewissen [...] der wei√üen Menschheit\\" A strong opponent of left-wing politics, he joined Wilhelm Sch√§fer in resigning from the Akademie der K√ºnste in 1931 over what he saw as their support for the activities of Heinrich Mann and Alfred D√∂blin.Jay W. Baird, Hitler's War Poets, 2008, p. 54  Nazism  He continued to write widely under the Nazis, taking up his pen to praise Adolf Hitler in a poem and to defend the Nazi book burnings, as well as to write pro-Nazi war novels such as Karlsbader Novellen 1786 (1935) and Das Gottgelobte Herz (1938). The Gottgelobte Herz (i.e. The God-blessed heart) is a novel about the Dominican nun Margareta Ebner. Indeed, his star rose under the Nazis because his literature fitted their world view.Karl Dietrich Bracher, The German Dictatorship, Penguin, 1970, p. 324 He was one of a number of writers added to the Prussian Academy of Arts after the Nazis came to power in 1933 at the expense of the likes of Franz Werfel, Ludwig Fulda and Jakob Wassermann, none of whom shared the Nazi weltanschauung.Viktor Reimann, The Man Who Created Hitler, William Kimber, 1977, p. 182 His 1934 play Gregor und Heinrich, concerning Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor and Pope Gregory VII, demonstrated an instance of his pro-Nazi stance as he dedicated it to \\"the German spirit in the process of being resurrected\\".Karl-Heinz Schoeps & Kathleen M. Dell'Orto, Literature and film in the Third Reich, pp. 130-1 As a reward for his high standing under the Nazis he was one of six writers included on 'List A' or the 'List of the God-gifted', properly known as the Gottbegnadeten list, who were exempted from military service on account of their prestige.Reimann, The Man Who Created Hitler, p. 192 He was also awarded the Goethe Prize in 1937.R. Wistrich, Who's Who in Nazi Germany, 1984, p. 177 In 1940 he published the anthology Vox humana and became a member of the Nazi partyErnst Klee: Das Kulturlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 2009, P. 296..  Post-war writing  Kolbenheyer was banned from writing for five years after the Second World War although from his base in West Germany he continued to publish novels that were largely in the same nationalist spirit as his previous output.Karl-Heinz Schoeps & Kathleen M. Dell'Orto, Literature and film in the Third Reich, p. 289 He also became a regular contributor to the far right, pan-European nationalist journal Nation Europa.Karl Dietrich Bracher, The German Dictatorship, Penguin, 1970, p. 585 Quotation In Kolbenheyer's drama Menschen und G√∂tter (i.e. Men and Gods), Orbis, Prague, 1944: :SON OF MAN :Go further monk, and heal :your excessive pain through my pain. :It flows to you as a part of yourself :out of the infiniteness. :Lo, the drops descend, :drops of blood out of heart and hand. :You shall humbly drink :the salvation by sacrifice, sent by God.Drama: Menschen und G√∂tter (i.e. Men and Gods), Orbis, Prague, 1944; \\"Begib dich, M√∂nch, und heile dein √úberma√ü an meinem Leid.

More than 26 medieval Greek manuscripts exist containing it, all of which give Eustathius of Antioch as the author. The work is supposedly about the Hexameron or the Six Days of Creation. In reality it contains rather more material than this, down to the time of Alexander the Great, all excerpted from earlier Christian writers, and has been titled Liber Chronicorum. It contains material by Alexander Polyhistor, possibly direct. It is also a useful witness for the Bestiary or Physiologus.

The first and only edition was printed in 1629 by Leo Allatius, with copious notes and a Latin translation, but also many misprints. The text and translation were reprinted by Migne in the Patrologia Graeca vol. 18. No edition has been printed since. No translation exists in any modern language. A study of the work exists by Friedrich Zoepfl. Authorship The work includes substantial extracts from the Homilies on the Hexameron of Basil the Great, delivered around 370 AD. Eustathius of Antioch was deposed in 330 AD. In addition Eusebius of Caesarea is labelled \\"holy\\" in the work, despite being an enemy of Eustathius. These factors mean that the name passed down in the manuscripts as author cannot be right. No other obvious candidate is available. ReferencesBibliography *Leo Allatius, S. P. N.

She was formerly the French naval brig Gu√™pe, (gu√™pe is the French for wasp) which the Navy captured in 1800. She served during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, and was sold out of naval service in 1811. Capture Gu√™pe was a brig built at Bordeaux in 1798 that operated against British shipping in the Atlantic. On 29 August 1800 the vessels of the British blockading squadron, which was under the command of Sir John Warren, sent their boats into the harbour at Vigo to attack and cut her out. The boarding party went in and, after a 15-minute fight, captured Gu√™pe; they then towed her out. She had a flush deck and was pierced for 20 guns but carried eighteen 9-pounders. She and her crew of 161 men were under the command of Citizen Dupan. In the attack she lost 25 men killed, including Dupan, and 40 wounded. British casualties amounted to four killed, 23 wounded and one missing. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"29 Aug. Boat Service 1800\\" to all surviving claimants from the action. A prize crew took Gu√™pe back to Portsmouth where the Admiralty fitted her out between October 1800 and August 1801. During this time she was re-rigged. British career Now named HMS Wasp she was commissioned in July 1801 under Commander Charles Bullen, and sent to Sierra Leone at the end of the year. At Freetown, Bullen landed guns and sailors to reinforce soldiers and militias composed of free blacks resettled from Nova Scotia and Jamaica (the Maroons), who were engaged in a campaign against the local Temne people. After the Temne signed a peace treaty in December and the situation had settled down, in March 1802 Wasp sailed from Sierra Leone. She sailed to the West Indies where she was paid off in July. Wasp recommissioned again in May 1803 under Commander Frederick Whitworth Aylmer, and on 19 July that year captured the privateer Despoir. Despoir was a lugger, pierced for 10 guns but only mounting two. She had a crew of 28 men under the command of Jean Delaballe. She was three days out of Hodierne and had made no captures. At the time was in company with Wasp. Aylmer sailed to the Mediterranean in June 1804. In August Wasp captured a Spanish lugger and sloop. The French privateer Venus recaptured these vessels, only to be herself captured by several East Indiamen, notably . Venus had five crewmen from Wasp on board as prisoners. On 12 and 16 January 1805, Wasp, under Alymer, captured the Spanish brigs Minerva and Carmen, and their cargoes. About two weeks later, on 21 February, Wasp captured the Spanish ship Victoria, and her cargo. Aylmer was succeeded by Lieutenant Joseph Packwood in an acting capacity, and he by Commander John Simpson, also in 1805. Wasp was with Sir John Orde's squadron patrolling off Cadiz, and had a narrow escape from a French squadron in August 1805. The slave ship , Robinson, master, was sailing from Africa to the West Indies when on 30 November a French privateer captured her. Wasp recaptured Lancaster and sent her into Barbados. Lancaster had had four men killed and nine wounded when she was captured.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4296. On 12 December, , and Wasp left Cork, escorting a convoy of 23 merchant vessels. Four days later the convoy encountered a French squadron consisting of five ships of the line and four sailing frigates, as well as nine other vessels that were too far away for assessment. The letter writer to the Naval Chronicle surmised that the distant vessels were the Africa squadron that had escorted and that the French had captured. On this occasion, the British warships and six merchant vessels went one way and the rest went another way. The French chased the warships and the six for a day, ignored the 17, and eventually gave up their pursuit. Boadicea then shadowed the French while Wasp went back to French and Spanish coasts to alert the British warships there. and her six charges encountered the French squadron again the next day, but after a desultory pursuit the French sailed off.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 15, pp.300-1. Lieutenant Buckland Sterling Bluett of received promotion to Commander and took over command of Wasp in 1806. He then sailed to the Leeward Islands. On 24 May she came across the former British cutter , which had been taken by mutineers four days earlier and delivered to the French, who had immediately commissioned her under the name Napol√©on and sent her out to capture some merchant vessels at Roseau. Wasp retook the cutter, which had on board 73 men under the command of Vincent Gautier, two of whom were killed before she surrendered. Napol√©on had been in company with the French naval schooner Imp√©riale. That evening the packet ship Duke of Montrose engaged Imp√©riale, which enabled , which had been in company with Wasp, to come up. As Cygnet arrived, Imp√©riale surrendered to Duke of Montrose. The Royal Navy took Imp√©riale into service as HMS Vigilant. In 1807 Commander William Parkinson took command of Wasp. She returned to Britain later that year under the command of Commander John Haswell. Fate Wasp was laid up at Deptford in May 1809. She was offered for sale on 13 December 1810, and was sold there on 17 May 1811.

In 1995 he founded MAU in Auckland, working with communities and artists from all over the world and has been described as New Zealand's most prolific dance and theatre company. Lemi has been invited to perform at the Venice Biennale an unprecedented three times ‚Äî for visual arts, dance and theatre. He has been the director of choice for the biggest theatrical production in Canadian history, the Luminato Festival‚Äôs revival of Apocalypsis, a two-part musical epic with more than a thousand performers and crew. He was also chosen by UNESCO to give the annual International Dance Day message in Paris for dancers around the world, for which he wrote a karakia for his message. Early life Lemi was born in Lano, Samoa to Samoan catechists and moved to New Zealand when he was 15 years old. While at high school in New Zealand he started to attend a series of workshops with the Maori Matua Tohunga master artist Irirangi Tiakiawa in Rotoiti. Ponifasio was then invited by Maori performing arts leader Tama Huata to work with him as part of his Maori cultural group Takitimu Trust, performing in communities throughout New Zealand and in reservations in Canada. Career Lemi Ponifasio began his artistic career as an avant-garde experimental performer, staging his epic ten-year solo dance investigation Body in Crisis, primarily in non-theatrical and outdoor spaces. His brief encounter with modern dance, butoh and classical ballet in the 1980s made him skeptical about the notion of contemporary dance and launched his search for the origin of his own dance. He started to travel the world and danced continuously.https://e-tangata.co.nz/news/lemi-ponifasio-i'm-on-the- stage/politics He explored the life of the body through cosmic vision, genealogy, philosophy, architecture, chant, dance and ceremonies of indigenous communities, especially Maori, Kiribati, Kanaky people of New Caledonia, Samoa, Tonga, Tahiti and the diverse islands of the Pacific region. After a decade of traveling, living and performing in many countries, Ponifasio returned to New Zealand. Reading Maori rights activist Eva Rickard quote \\"only dead fish flow with the current\\", he decided to call his first group performance work Fish of the Day. Ponifasio formed MAU - the philosophical foundation and direction of his work, the name of his work, and the communities he works with. MAU is a Samoan word that means the declaration to the truth of a matter. With a group of young performers and friends, Ponifasio created Illumina as the first work of MAU performed at the Galaxy Theatre, Auckland, New Zealand 1992. Ponifasio collaborates with people in all walks of life, working in schools, universities, in factories, villages, opera houses, castles, galleries, and stadiums. The work has included fully staged operas, theatre, dance, exhibitions, festivals and community forums. At the forefront of the international art scene, Ponifasio performs and exhibits his work worldwide including the Festival d'Avignon, BAM Brooklyn Academy of Music New York, Ruhrtriennale, Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts New York, Edinburgh International Festival, Theater der Welt, Th√©√¢tre de la Ville Paris, Onassis Cultural Centre Athens, London‚Äôs Southbank Centre, Holland Festival, Carriageworks Sydney, Luminato Festival Toronto, Vienna Festival, Berliner Festspiele, Santiago a Mil Chile, the Venice Biennale and in the Pacific region.

In 2009, the book was adapted into a Hallmark Channel film starring Ally Sheedy, Meat Loaf, Sean Patrick Flanery, and Nia Peeples. Plot summary Jane Alexander was a sheltered, attractive widow living with her large, close- knit family in her small hometown of Truckee, California. For six years, she had been living with Tom O'Donnell, her charismatic and handsome boyfriend. He had used wit, charm, and tales of adventure to borrow money for extensive home business operations and investing. When Gertrude McCabe, her favorite 88-year- old aunt, was gruesomely murdered in San Jose in 1983, a case which baffled San Jose PD. A break came from newly assigned police detective Jack Morris, whose investigative genius would soon solve the case. It was a difficult case to crack, but the motive was clearly something personal. McCabe was bludgeoned, choked with a bicycle lock, stabbed over two dozen times in her neck and back with a knife. Morris soon convinced Alexander that the killer was her boyfriend, and after O'Donnell disappeared with over $10,000 of her money and left her near bankruptcy, Alexander embarked on an epic journey to track down and outsmart the wily con artist. After 13 years of collecting evidence, Alexander and Morris managed to convict O'Donnell of first degree murder. Police believe O'Donnell killed Gertrude McCabe because Jane Alexander would then inherit her Aunt Gertrude's estate. O'Donnell was sentenced to life imprisonment; he died in 2010.http://www.citizensagainsthomicide.org/index.php/about-cah/citizen-jane- the-book/ Publishing history James Dalessandro first read about Jane Alexander's story in the mid-1990s on the front page of the Pacific Sun in Marin County, California. Much of the research comes from detailed diaries that Alexander kept of the entire ordeal. David Mehnert contributed to the book after being in a private screenwriting class taught by Dalessandro. The book was a #1 Amazon and national best seller in its Kindle/digital release in 2016 in true crime. Jane Alexander Alexander, a grandmother of 12 at the time, actively contributed to Dalessandro's writing process. She also founded the organization Citizens Against Homicide to help others solve the murders of their loved ones. CAH is now a nationwide organization, in all 50 US states, with more than 7,500 members. In 2006 she received the prestigious Minerva Award for her efforts. She died on December 14, 2008, at the age of 86. At the time of her death, she was working on 500 open homicide cases and had helped solve more than 20 cold case murders, along with the help of Jan Miller, whose daughter Veronica was the victim of a still unsolved homicide.

Operation Bid Rig On July 23, 2009, Suarez was arrested as part of Operation Bid Rig, a joint operation of the FBI, IRS, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey into political corruption and money laundering. Suarez was charged with accepting a $10,000 cash bribe from an FBI informant through a middleman, Vincent Tabbachino, for assistance in arranging approvals to develop properties in Ridgefield. Though the two other mayors implicated in the sting operation, Peter Cammarano of Hoboken and Dennis Elwell of Secaucus, resigned following their arrests, Suarez rebuffed calls for his resignation, including from Governor Jon Corzine.

In 1938, he moved to Machane Yehuda. He was the head of the Chevrah Kadisha and the Av Bet Din of the Sephardic Community of Jerusalem. They used to say that he married off half of Jerusalem and buried the other half. Rav Yosef Yitzchak ran a minyan in the old city of Jerusalem at a shul called Tzuv Devash.  The Chevrah Kadisha on The Mount of Olives  At one point Arabs were throwing stones at the chevra kadisha who were burying the dead on the Mount of Olives and they relayed this to Rebbi Yosef, who at that time was the head of the Chevrah Kadisha of the Sephardic Community in Jerusalem. Rebbi Yosef came up with an idea, he would go up with the chevra kadisha except he would be carried up like one of the dead. Once they were on the Mount of Olives and in the process of burying the dead, the Arabs started throwing stones, and the chevra kadisha ran away. But Rebbi Yosef was lying there, and once everyone was gone and the Arabs were there near him, he got up and in his long black robe and a staff, he ran after them, and surely the Arabs were scared and the chevra kadisha was allowed to continue burying their dead. There was a book written about his life, published only a year later called \\"Hod Yosef\\". It was put together by the leaders of the community. Family Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Shloush had a wife named Sa'ada and three children, Rav David Chaim Shloush the Chief Rabbi of Netanya, Rabbi Avraham Shloush the Chief Rabbi of Kfar Saba and Avigayil who is the Rabbanit or wife of Rav Ezran Z\\"L who was a Rosh Kollel in Jerusalem. Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Shloush‚Äôs father, Rav David Shloush ZT\\"L was a Rosh Yeshiva in Marrakech, Morocco. He had a few children who had each died at the age of 2-3, and once again his baby, Yosef Yitzchak was two and was sick. He went to the Aron Kodesh and prayed that this baby's life would be spared in turn for his own life. Within two weeks, Rav David Shloush ZT\\"L died and the baby Yosef Yitzchak was saved. Then Rav David Shloush ZT\\"L, also known as Hamelech David, came to his wife, Sultana in a dream and told her to go to Israel. She did not pay attention to the dream, but the dream came to her two more times. There is a tradition that if a dream happens three times it is serious, and thus she went to the Bet Din (Jewish Court) and told them that she had the dream three times and they told her that she must go to Israel as he had instructed, as it was a valid dream. She still did not want to go to Israel, but once again Hamelech David came to her in a dream and told her to go to Israel but she answered that she wanted to stay in Marrakech so that she could visit his grave. He told her to go to the grave of the Ohr Hachaim Hakadosh and to pray there. She waited for her children to grow a little older and when Yosef Yitzchak was twelve they travelled along with a big caravan to Israel. When Hamelech David died, Yosef Yitzchak was two and Sultana, Hamelech David‚Äôs wife, was pregnant. Thus, Yosef Yitzchak had a younger sister who was two years younger, and they both travelled to Israel. Once Hamelech David was leaving his synagogue along with one of his students. Hamelech David told his student to go and check inside the synagogue before they leave, something which was not a usual routine. His student checked and there was no one there. They left and the synagogue collapsed.  See also  * Tzuf Dvash Synagogue * Maghrebim References * The Sephardic Community Committee of Jerusalem. Hod Yosef. Jerusalem: Y. A.

With her husband, and after his death, she hosted political and literary gatherings at their home, Holland House. Biography Henry Richard Vassall Fox, 3rd Baron Holland; Mrs Brown, portrait by Sir Edwin Henry Landseer Elizabeth Vassall was born in 1771 in London, the only child and universal heiress of Richard Vassall, a planter in Jamaica and Mary Clarke, and granddaughter of Florentius Vassall, a wealthy planter and slave-owner in Jamaica whose last will was dated 1777. =First marriage= She married Sir Godfrey Webster, 4th Baronet in 1786. He was more than 20 years older than she was. They had five children: *Sir Godfrey Vassall Webster, 5th Baronet (6 October 1789 ‚Äì 17 July 1836). *A son (born and died 1790). *Lt. Col. Sir Henry Vassall Webster (1793‚Äì1847). *Lady Harriet Frances Webster (1794 ‚Äì 7 August 1849), married on 5 June 1816 Hon. Adm. Sir Fleetwood Broughton Reynolds Pellew. *A son (born and died October 1795). She was intensely unhappy in her marriage and she spent much of the early 1790s travelling in Europe, visiting France, Germany, Switzerland and Italy. She enjoyed the guidance and friendship of the Duchess of Devonshire and politician Thomas Pelham with whom she had an affair resulting in a daughter, Harriet Frances (b.1794). =Second marriage= In 1794, Lady Webster met in Naples Whig politician Henry Fox, 3rd Baron Holland, two years her junior, and they embarked on a love affair. They had seven children: *General Charles Richard Fox (6 November 1796 ‚Äì 13 April 1873). Born before the marriage of his parents. *The Hon. Stephen Fox (18 January 1799 ‚Äì 22 November 1800). *A son (born and died 17 March 1801). *Henry Edward Fox, 4th Baron Holland (7 May 1802 ‚Äì 18 December 1859). *The Hon. Mary Elizabeth Fox (19 February 1806 ‚Äì 7 December 1891), married on 24 May 1830 Thomas Powys, 3rd Baron Lilford. *The Hon. Georgiana Anne Fox (7 November 1809 ‚Äì 31 October 1819). *A daughter (born and died 24 June 1812). On 4 July 1797 she was divorced by Webster on the grounds of adultery. She married Holland two days later, on 6 July. They lived together in Holland House in Kensington, then just outside London, and for many years hosted the elite of Whig society. Visitors included Lord Grey, George Tierney, Samuel Rogers, Walter Scott, Ugo Foscolo, Sydney Smith and Richard Brinsley Sheridan. Lady Holland became known by her guests, and contemporary observers for her domineering nature, in contrast to her husband. In his journals, Sydney Smith, a friend of both Lord and Lady Holland, called her a \\"formidable woman\\". Actress Fanny Kemble visited Holland house with her sister Adelaide Kemble described what she called the \\"domineering rudeness\\" of Lady Holland. Lady Holland's rule extended not only to all of the guests at Holland House but to Lord Holland too. She dictated when he should go to bed, what he should wear and would have servants take him away from the table in his wheelchair when he was in the middle of telling a story. Both Lord and Lady Holland were great admirers of Napoleon Bonaparte. In 1815, Lady Holland commission a bronze bust of him from sculptor Antonio Canova, which was placed in the garden at Holland House. After Napoleon was exiled to Saint Helena in 1815, Lady Holland sent him supplies of food and hundreds of books. Napoleon remembered Lady Holland in his will and following his death in 1821, his companions General Henri Gratien Bertrand and the Marquis de Montholon arrived at Holland House, delivering a snuffbox. The gold snuffbox, which had been a gift to Napoleon from Pope Pius VI, was bequeathed by Lady Holland to the British Museum. Lord Holland died on 22 October 1840. After his death, Lady Holland lived at 33 South Street, a property she had inherited from her mother. She continued to entertain, and it was here that the historian John Allen died in 1843. In November of that year she moved to 9 Great Stanhope Street, a property she rented from Lord Palmerston. Lady Holland died in 1845. By the end of her life, she had become estranged from her children. She supposedly said to Lord John Russell 'I hate my son, I don't like my daughter'. In his Memoirs, diarist Charles Greville called Lady Holland \\"a social light which illuminated and adorned England, and even Europe, for half a century\\". Introduction of the dahlia Lady Holland became known for permanently introducing the dahlia to the United Kingdom. An unsuccessful attempt had been made in 1789 by the Marchioness of Bute who brought the plant from Spain, but failed to propagate it. Whilst in Madrid in 1804, Lady Holland was given either dahlia seeds or roots by botanist Antonio Jos√© Cavanilles. She sent them back to England, to Lord Holland's librarian Mr Buonaiuti at Holland House, who successfully raised the plants. In 1824, Lord Holland sent his wife a note containing the following verse: > \\"The dahlia you brought to our isle > Your praises for ever shall speak; > Mid gardens as sweet as your smile, > And in colour as bright as your cheek.\\"  Ownership of slaves  When the ownership of slaves was finally abolished in the British Empire in 1834, the government paid Compensation for slavery - not to the enslaved people, but to the slaveholders. The government paid ¬£20m, 40% of the HM Treasury's annual spending budget (¬£17 billion in today's terms) in compensation. This vast sum of borrowed money was subsequently paid off by the British taxpayers and only finally repaid in 2015. Her compensation was paid to her husband Lord HollandKathleen Mary Butler: The Economics of Emancipation: Jamaica and Barbados, 1823-1843. UNC Press Books, 2017 who was associated with three different claims, for the 401 enslaved people on the estates in Jamaica and received a ¬£7,211 payment at the time (worth ¬£ in ). Lord Holland's entry in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, which gave an account of his political career, explained that Holland adopted the name Vassall in 1800 'to safeguard his children's rights to his wife's West Indian fortune' - but was otherwise silent on the tensions around Holland's position as slave-owner.

It was built by the Tokyo Gas and Electric Industry (also known as Gasuden), to break the world record for longest flight, setting a closed circuit world record of 11,651 km (7,240 mi) in March 1938. Development and design In 1931, the Aeronautical Research Institute of the Tokyo Imperial University commenced studies to design an aircraft to break the world closed-circuit distance record, gaining a grant from the Japanese Diet or parliament to finance the project. Initial design was completed in August 1934, and the Tokyo Gas and Electric Company (also known as Gasuden) was selected to build the aircraft, despite the fact that it had only limited resources, and had previously only built small numbers of wooden light aircraft.Koken Long-range Research-plane Takenaka, K. Classic Airplane Museum. 24 July 2007. Retrieved 24 July 2009. The design produced by the Aeronautical Research Institute and Gasuden was a single-engined low-wing cantilever monoplane with retractable undercarriage. It was of all-metal construction, with fabric-covered outer wings and control surfaces. While it was originally intended to be powered by a diesel engine, this proved impracticable, and in the end a modified version of the German BMW VIII gasoline-fuelled engine, license-built by Kawasaki, was chosen. Construction was slow, and the aircraft was not completed until March 1937. It was first flown on 25 May 1937, piloted by Major Yuzo Fujita of the Imperial Japanese Army. Operational history The first two attempts at breaking the record, on 13 November 1937 and 10 May 1938 were unsuccessful, owing to undercarriage problems and an autopilot failure respectively. The Koken-Ki took off for a third attempt from Kisarazu, Chiba at 04:55 on 13 May 1938, flying a four- sided course of 402 km (249 mi). After 29 laps of the circuit, at 19:21 on 15 May, it landed at Kisarazu, having flown a distance of 11,651.011 km (7,239 mi), a new world closed-circuit distance record. This record, which remains the only aviation record ever set by Japan that was recognised by the F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale, the world governing body for aviation records, remained standing until August 1939, when it was broken by an Italian Savoia-Marchetti SM.82 which flew 12,936 km (8,038 mi). The Koken-ki was used for occasional test flights, last flying in 1939, and survived World War II only to be burned following the end of the war.

She died of breast cancer in 2001, at the age of 53.Cotter, Holland, \\"Hollis Sigler, 53, Painter Whose Theme Was Her Illness\\", New York Times, April 3, 2001. Early life and education Sigler was born Suzanne Hollis Sigler in Gary, Indiana to Philip Sigler and Marilyn Ryan Sigler. Her family moved to Cranbury, New Jersey when she was eleven. She completed grade school and high school there, receiving her diploma from Hightstown High School in 1966. Sigler was interested in art as a child and began painting in elementary school. She went on to study art at Moore College of Art in Philadelphia, where she was awarded the Bachelor of Arts in 1970; she completed graduate studies at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where she received the Master of Fine Arts in 1973. She had early success with a series of photo realist paintings that depicted underwater swimmers but by 1976, in a gesture meant to repudiate what she considered a male-dominated style, she abandoned realism entirely in favor of a faux-na√Øve approach. Her subject matter, presented in a way that suggested the work of an untutored or na√Øve artist, focused on a woman's world-view. A tendency toward autobiographical content was evident even at the early stages of what would become her signature style. Effect of cancer diagnosis and illness on art Breast cancer ran in Sigler's family; her great-grandmother, Sarah Anna Truitt Ryan, died of the disease and Sigler's own mother, diagnosed with breast cancer in 1983,Caponegro, Casha, \\"Renowned artist sucuumbs to cancer: Hollis Sigler, former Cranbury resident, dead at 53\\", The Cranberry Press, Princeton, New Jersey, Monday, April 9, 2001. succumbed to it in April 1995. Sigler received a diagnosis of breast cancer in August 1985. The artist underwent a mastectomy and chemotherapy, but by 1993 the cancer had spread to her bones, pelvis and spine.Fleming, Lee, \\"Journal of Joy and Sorrow; Hollis Sigler's Emotion- Drenched 'Breast Cancer' Paintings\\", Washington Post, pp. B1, B4, September 20, 1993. Among the first art works dealing with her illness that Sigler produced after her cancer diagnosis was a series of five vitreograph prints. Produced in the fall of 1985 at Littleton Studios in North Carolina, the prints, titled \\"When Choice isn't Possible\\", \\"Forever Unobtainable\\", \\"Needing to Make a Change\\", \\"She still Dreams of Flying\\", and \\"There is Healing to be Done\\" introduced a darker side to the artist's woman-oriented works. Almost a decade after those works were produced, Sigler noted in a 1994 interview that she thought the images in her paintings would change as she changed; instead, while the content of her work changed, her imagery remained the same.Windy City Times, \\"Artist Hollis Sigler Dies\\", Lambda Publications Inc., April 4, 2001. In an interview published in Chicago's New Art Examiner, Sigler said that she realized that she would eventually die of breast cancer, and this knowledge had changed the way she approached her art. In 1992 she began her series of paintings \\"Breast Cancer Journal: Walking with the Ghosts of My Grandmothers\\". Intensely personal, the vividly colored works portray unpeopled scenes where women's clothing (dresses, aprons, corsets, gloves and stockings), furniture (including chairs, beds and vanities) and antique sculptures (including the Nike of Samothrace and the Venus de Milo) are surrogates for the artist. Embued with a life of their own, they enact the emotional responses of the artist to her illness. These paintings could be shockingly forthright. In a review of the 1993 exhibition \\"The Breast Cancer Journal: Walking with the Ghosts of my Grandmothers\\" at the National Museum of Women in the Arts, journalist Lee Fleming wrote of the content of one painting in particular:The painting, \\"Walking with the Ghosts of My Grandmothers\\" (1992) is a 66 x 54 inch painting with a hand-painted frame. > The glorious Nike of Samothrace, \\"Winged Victory,\\" stands in armless profile > atop a shallow fiery-hued tumulus not unlike a breast. Red rain falls; a > bloodied, paving-stone path encirles the mound like a scar. The ground > inside and outside this red-gray line is littered with discarded > contemporary and antique clothes, all of which share a bleeding cutout where > one breast would be ... The paintings could also embody the artist's vision of the spiritual human being triumphing over the ordeal of breast cancer. Lee Fleming cites \\"To Kiss the Spirits: Now this is What it is Really Like,\\"The 1993 painting is an oil on canvas, 66 x 66 inches square with a hand-painted frame. as an example of a painting that \\"sums up Sigler's struggle in a glorious apotheosis ...\\" The lower part of the composition shows a night time village of small houses with glowing windows. A description from the National Museum of Women in the Arts notes that > the upper two thirds of the canvas pay homage to Vincent Van Gogh's Starry > Night. At the center of the picture, bathed in celestial light the > silhouetted \\"Lady\\" rises effortlessly along a fluted staircase, changing > color from purple through rose to white as her arms slowly lift upward to > become an angel's wings. Sigler's companion of 21 years was the jewelry designer Patricia Locke. Teaching and art You Can't Always Get What You Want by Hollis Sigler, Honolulu Museum of Art In 1978, Sigler became a member of the Columbia College Chicago faculty in the department of Art and Design. As a teacher, she was up to date on issues in contemporary art and had a talent for communicating this knowledge to her students. She was also fond of taking her students on field trips to learn first hand about influences in art from the European-based collections at the Art Institute of Chicago to the anthropologically-based exhibits at the Field Museum. Sigler's teaching awards included the College Art Association's Artist Award for Lifetime Achievement in early 2001. Her mature artistic style was faux-na√Øve, featuring paintings whose subjects, furniture and clothing set in doll-house type interiors and suburban landscapes, were stand-ins for the implicitly female figure.Corinne, Tee A., \\"Chicago Painter Hollis Sigler, 1948-2001\\", artcataloguing.net; accessed November 21, 2003.

On 12 June 1940, Lieutenant-General Sir Alan Brooke returned to France and next day, assumed command of all British troops in the country. He placed the British units fighting with the Tenth Army under the command of Lieutenant-General J. H. Marshall-Cornwall. This improvised formation was known as Norman Force and on 15 June comprised the 3rd Armoured Brigade of the 1st Armoured Division, the 157th (Highland Light Infantry) Brigade, 71st Field Regiment R.A. and the Troop Carrying Company of the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division. Next day, Brooke was able to prevent the rest of the 52nd (Lowland) Division being sent to join the 157th Infantry Brigade, and during the night he was informed that he was no longer under French command and must prepare to withdraw the British forces from France. Marshall-Cornwall was ordered to withdraw towards Cherbourg while continuing to co-operate with the French. The rest of the 52nd (Lowland) Division was ordered back to a defence line near Cherbourg to cover the evacuation on 15 June. The RAF Advanced Air Striking Force (AASF) was also directed to send its last bomber squadrons back to Britain and use the fighter squadrons to cover the evacuations. The German advance over the Seine had paused while bridges were built but the advance began again during the day, with the 157th Infantry Brigade engaged east of Conches-en-Ouche with the Tenth Army. The army was ordered to retreat to a line from Verneuil to Argentan and the Dives river, where the British took over an front either side of the Mortagne-au-Perche‚ÄìVerneuil-sur-Avre road. German forces followed up quickly and on 16 June, Altmayer ordered the army to retreat into the Brittany peninsula. Following Operation Cycle (10 to 13 June), Operation Ariel, the final Allied evacuation, began on 15 June.

ServInt provides hosting services to tens of thousands of sites all over the world.  History  ServInt was founded by Reed J. Caldwell in 1995. When it moved out of a college dorm in 1995, the company had one employee, a $10,000 family loan, some student credit cards, and a single Pentium-90 Web server running Linux 1.2.9. ServInt grew and became known as one of the first web-hosting companies to offer a managed, dedicated server solution. It went on to build a private network that came close to achieving Tier 1 status, lacking only domestic Sprint peering. In subsequent years leading to the Dot Com bust in 2000, ServInt invested heavily in a large- scale, transnational content distribution network. While ambitious, the collapse of the bubble caused interest in the network to wane. The spiraling costs of the network coupled with the sheer number of ServInt clients folding from the collapse forced ServInt to file Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection in February 2001. ServInt emerged from bankruptcy protection a few months later, and refocused its staff and resources towards managed web hosting. Since 2002, the company has focused on providing enterprise-level Virtual Private Server (VPS), Cloud hosting and Dedicated server options to its customers from its data centers in Virginia, California and Washington, DC. ServInt has maintained a competitive presence in hosting since their re-emergence. In December 2010 Netcraft reported that ServInt hosts Wikileaks. ServInt has been outspoken in its criticism of the Stop Online Piracy Act through former ServInt COO Christian Dawson, who has made multiple public arguments against the bill. ServInt was acquired by Leaseweb USA on May 8, 2018. https://www.leaseweb.com/press/releases/leaseweb-acquires-hosting-pioneer- servint  Social media outreach  On July 7, 2009, competitor Rackspace experienced the first in a series of outages that caused a firestorm across the web. On July 8, ServInt's CEO, Reed Caldwell, posted a defense of Rackspace's handling of the outages on the ServInt Source, the company's corporate blog. The defense was a response to what Caldwell felt was \\"disingenuous poaching\\" on the part of a rival webhost, OnlineTech. Though the host was not mentioned by name in the post, the backlash was tangible, and OnlineTech's CEO Yan Ness issued a personal response. ServInt's use of social media and focus on ethical competition was widely acknowledged as a boon for the company. Author and social media blogger Shel Israel referred to Caldwell's message as \\"lethal generosity\\". The incident also spurred an ongoing conversation about the validity and ethics behind \\"rescue\\" marketing. Services and partners ServInt's primary services provide clients with managed virtual private servers, dedicated web hosting services, and open proxies. The company partners with several organizations to deliver additional products, including Jelastic, MySQL, Apache, Symantec, and WordPress. ServInt was the first web host to launch a Jelastic Platform-as-a-Service cloud offering.

A cardinal protector is the representative of a Roman Catholic nation or organisation within the College of Cardinals, appointed by the pope. The role was terminated as a result of the English Reformation. The role of national protectorships within the College developed during the fifteenth century, due to developments in the emergence of national monarchies and Renaissance diplomacy.Wilkie, 1974, p. 5. Cardinal protectors of Roman Catholic religious orders date back farther to the thirteenth century. According to King Henry VIII, the cardinal protector \\"indueth as it were our owne Person, for the defence of Us and our Realme in al matiers [in the Curia]...touching the same\\".Wilkie, 1974, p. 6. The cardinal protector represented the monarch in consistory, especially in cases where the right of investiture was divided between the pope and the monarch, and also led the English diplomatic corps in Rome. Although earlier cardinals had filled similar roles, \\"the existence of national protectorships was first openly and regularly recognized only\\" by Pope Julius II.Wilkie, 1974, p. 7. The terms 'cardinal protector' and 'cardinal procurator' were \\"used very loosely and sometimes interchangeably during the fifteenth century\\".Wilkie, 1974, p. 8. The earliest reference to a 'cardinal protector' of England dates from 1492, but according to Wilkie, this results from a confusion between this office and that of cardinal procurator. Unlike other national cardinal protectors, the cardinal protectors of England, Scotland, and Ireland were generally chosen exclusively by the pope. The cardinal was \\"imposed from above, rather than chosen\\" and often had no direct relationship with the governments of these countries.Signorotto and Visceglia, 2002, p. 163Court and politics in papal Rome, 1492‚Äì1700 By Gianvittorio Signorotto, Maria Antonietta Visceglia, pg163 The English cardinal protector played a large role in English ecclesiastical appointments, and a substantial role in similar appointments in Scotland and Ireland.Wilkie, 1974, pp. 53‚Äì73. History=Piccolomini (1492‚Äì1503)= Pope Pius III Francesco Piccolomini, the future Pope Pius III, was the first cardinal protector of England, elevated on the initiative of King Henry VII, and also the first officially approved cardinal protector of \\"any nation whatever\\".Wilkie, 1974, p. 10. Henry VII viewed good relations with Rome as a protection against domestic and foreign enemies and sent Christopher Urswick, his \\"almoner and trusted councillor\\" to Rome after receiving a bull of dispensation to marry Elizabeth of York.Wilkie, 1974, p. 11. When Henry VII first sought a cardinal protector in 1492, he feared that many of the English bishops would support his Yorkist opponents (to whom they owed their appointments).Wilkie, 1974, p. 15. A variety of other disagreements existed, such as the papal income tax and the refusal of the pope to create John Morton, the archbishop of Canterbury, a cardinal; Innocent VII had passed over Morton in his first consistory, despite creating two French cardinals.Wilkie, 1974, p. 16. Nor had John Sherwood, the English ambassador in Rome, been created a cardinal in 1484, despite the request of King Richard III.Wilkie, 1974, p. 17. Piccolomini's creation as cardinal protector was requested by Henry VII in a letter congratulating the newly elected Pope Alexander VI, and was confirmed in a response which was probably written by Giovanni Gigli.Wilkie, 1974, p. 18. Piccolomini was already the protector of the Camaldese Benedictines and was close to German princes, although he was not the German protector in any official sense, and his protectorship of England is \\"the first official one of any cardinal which can be firmly established\\".Wilkie, 1974, pp. 20‚Äì21. Henry VII did not object to Piccolomini's German connections, even viewing them as an asset against the French.Wilkie, 1974, p. 21. =Castellesi (1503‚Äì1504)= The appointment of Adriano Castellesi as cardinal on 31 May 1503 \\"eclipsed England's cardinal protector\\", with appointments to the English sees thereafter being referred through Castellesi instead of through Piccolomini.Wilkie, 1974, pp. 25‚Äì26. Piccolomini was himself elected as Pope Pius III on 22 September 1503, only to die less than a month later, on 18 October; Castellesi did not vote for him and Piccolomini was chosen for his perceived neutrality rather than for his English connections.Wilkie, 1974, p. 27. According to the account of Castellesi, Pius III acknowledged him as his de facto successor as protector. Castellesi was a favourite of Pope Alexander VI, which became a liability during the reign of Pope Julius II.Wilkie, 1974, p. 28. During Julius II's reign, Castellesi, \\"although neither requesting nor mentioning the office of protector of England, certainly presented himself to Henry VII as the cardinal responsible for English affairs in the Curia\\". In an attempt to secure his status against the intrigues of Silvestro Gigli, Castellesi donated his residence, the Palazzo Giraud Torlonia on the present Via della Conciliazione, to Henry VII.Wilkie, 1974, pp. 29‚Äì30. In 1504, Henry VII named six official members of his embassy, headed by Castellesi, and also including Sir Gilbert Talbot, Richard Beere, Robert Sherborne, Silvestro Gigli, and Edward Scott.Wilkie, 1974, p. 30. Paris de Grassi, the master of papal ceremonies, referred to Castellesi as \\"Regis Protector\\" in his notes of a meeting between the embassy and the pope. =della Rovere (1504‚Äì1508)= Galeotto della Rovere A letter from Julius II to Henry VII dated 6 July 1504, remarks that the king had chosen the pope's cardinal-nephew Galeotto della Rovere as cardinal protector; the letter does not mention Castellesi.Wilkie, 1974, p. 31. della Rovere's selection was likely arranged by Gigli. Castellesi was compensated by being promoted to the wealthier See of Bath and Wells. Castellesi lost favour with the king and fled Rome until the death of Julius II.Wilkie, 1974, pp. 31‚Äì34. Rovere died on 11 September 1508, leaving England without a cardinal protector. Sherbone and Hugh Inge were back in England; Scott was dead; Gigli was in England as nuncio. The \\"only man on whose loyalty the king could truly rely\\" was Christopher Fisher, who was a \\"single, bumbling amateur\\" compared to the more seasoned curial diplomats who surrounded him. Henry VII himself died on 21 April 1509. Another cardinal-nephew, Sisto della Rovere, who received the vice-chancellorship and all the benefices of his half-brother, was not explicitly named as protector, although he wrote to Henry VII stating his intent to \\"maintain his brother's friendships\\".Wilkie, 1974, pp. 35‚Äì36. Henry VIII replied to Sisto that he considered his friendship especially valuable, asserting that Sisto had been close to his father.Wilkie, 1974, p. 36. There is no evidence that Sisto was offered the protectorship. =Aldiosi (1509‚Äì1510)= Francesco Adiosi Cardinal Francesco Adiosi may have become cardinal protector, but this appointment \\"cannot be exactly established\\" as his only surviving letters to England do not mention the protectorate.Wilkie, 1974, p. 37. Adiosi is explicitly mentioned as protector in a 1509 letter from Christopher Bainbridge (the first English curial cardinal since the death of Adam Easton in 1397Wilkie, 1974, p. 40.), by which point Adiosi and go-between Girolamo Bonvisio were on the \\"brink of disgrace\\".Wilkie, 1974, p. 38. Bonvisio disclosed the contents of his discussions with the king to a French agent and confessed his being employed by Aldiosi under threat of torture; by this point Adiosi was no longer protector. According to a 6 April 1510 letter from the Venetian ambassador, the king dismissed Adiosi as protector and gave the post to Sisto della Rovere.Wilkie, 1974, p. 39. There is no direct evidence that Sisto ever received the official title before he died in March 1517. Until the death of Julius II, Bainbridge \\"filled the vacuum, real or in effect, in the protectorship of England\\". Castellesi returned to Rome on the death of Julius II on 21 February 1513 for the papal conclave, 1513; although Castellesi \\"tactually\\" voted for Bainbridge on the second ballot, the two inevitably came into conflict as \\"rival representatives of England\\".Wilkie, 1974, p. 45. The lack of consistorial records, which would list which cardinals referred the nominations of which bishops, are missing for this period, making it impossible to assess the extent of Bainbridge's role.Wilkie, 1974, p. 74. =Medici (1514‚Äì1523)= In 1514, Gigli (as the agent of Wolsey and Henry VIII) arranged for another cardinal-nephew Giulio de'Medici (future Pope Clement VII) to be cardinal protector of England. Medici's letter of appointment makes no reference to Sisto della Rovere. An 8 February 1514 letter from Pope Leo X to Henry VIII of England flatters the king for having elevated the pope's cardinal-nephew and cousin as protector.Wilkie, 1974, p. 48. The pope's brother Giuliano de' Medici was also made a Knight of the Garter (just as Guidobaldo II della Rovere had been made when della Rovere had been made protector). Pope Leo X (center) with his cardinal-nephew Giulio de'Medici (left, future Pope Clement VII) Bainbridge was \\"short-circuited\\" by the appointment of Medici, although he continued to play a role until his death on 14 July 1514.Wilkie, 1974, pp. 49‚Äì50. Gigli was accused of having played a role in the death of Bainbridge and Medici was charged with examining the facts, concluding that Gigli was innocent.Wilkie, 1974, pp. 50‚Äì51. The period between Piccolomini and Medici (from 1503 to 1514) is one where the role of the protector was not well-defined.Wilkie, 1974, p. 73. The importance of the office increased significantly with the appointment of Medici in 1514, due in no small part to the friendship between Medici and Wolsey.Wilkie, 1974, p. 81. According to Wilkie, \\"its importance stemmed from the special relationship of the papacy with England as the most reliable supporter of papal independence\\". Medici accepted the protectorship of France as well in 1516, meeting Francis I of France personally in Bologna, much to the \\"discomfiture of England\\".Wilkie, 1974, p. 201. Medici was elected Clement VII on 19 November 1523. =Campeggio (1524‚Äì1539)= Lorenzo Campeggio was close to Medici and served as cardinal protector to Germany at the time of Medici's election.Wilkie, 1974, p. 141. Campeggio received a variety of appointments from Clement VII before Henry VIII chose him as protector on 22 February 1524 (conditional on the pope's acceptance of Wolsey as legate for life).Wilkie, 1974, p. 143‚Äì144. Campeggio found his loyalty divided when he was appointed with Wolsey to judge the issue of the requested annulment of Henry VIII of England from Catherine of Aragon, the aunt of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor.Wilkie, 1974, pp. 176‚Äì190. Campeggio came out in favour of the legitimacy of the marriage, after considerable delay in travelling and reviewing the canonical evidence.Wilkie, 1974, pp. 190‚Äì199. The final sentence in the case was handed down in Rome in 1534, the same year the English Parliament passed the First Act of Supremacy.Wilkie, 1974, p. 200. Henry VIII was particularly displeased by Campeggio's \\"constant company with the emperor\\" in the years prior to his verdict and Campeggio's rapidly growing income, having been granted the bishopric of Huesca and Jaca in 1530, and the bishopric of Mallorca in 1532, both by Charles V.Wilkie, 1974, pp. 203‚Äì205. In January 1531, Campeggio was dismissed as cardinal protector, although it did not become public knowledge until May.Wilkie, 1974, p. 207. At first it was unclear whether Henry VIII intended to appoint a successor, with Giovanni Domenico de Cupis emerging as an active candidate in March 1532.Wilkie, 1974, p. 208. The king favoured Alessandro Farnese (future Pope Paul III), and instructed his ambassadors on 21 March to offer it to Farnese, and then de Cupis or Giovanni del Monte (future Pope Julius III) in the event that Farnese declined or was not approved. Not knowing that Henry VIII had already secretly married the pregnant Anne Boleyn, Clement VII decided to reach out to the monarch by appointing Thomas Cranmer, an outspoken proponent of Henry VIII's annulment, as archbishop of Canterbury.Wilkie, 1974, pp. 210‚Äì211. A threatened excommunication was handed down when Cranmer pronounced Henry VIII's marriage null and void; Henry VIII responded by telling Campeggio's vicar general for Salisbury to stop all revenues from his bishopric until further notice.Wilkie, 1974, pp. 213‚Äì214. Henry VIII then claimed the authority to act on behalf of Campeggio in making various ecclesiastical appointments.Wilkie, 1974, pp. 214‚Äì215. The fifth session of the Reformation Parliament deprived Campeggio and Girolamo Ghinucci of their English sees (unless they swore loyalty to the king).Wilkie, 1974, p. 216. Unaware of this statute, two days later on 23 March 1534 Campeggio entered Consistory for the final ruling against annulment.Wilkie, 1974, pp. 218‚Äì219. According to Wilkie, \\"years of cooperation from both popes and cardinal protectors had taught a wilful Henry VIII to expect to have his way over the church of England\\".Wilkie, 1974, p. 217. Clement VII died on 25 September before learning of the denial of papal authority on 31 March by the Convocation of Canterbury.Wilkie, 1974, p. 219. In the 1534 papal conclave, Campeggio was the only cardinal to oppose Farnese's proposal for non-secret voting and the only cardinal not to kiss the feet of the newly elected Farnese as Paul III.Wilkie, 1974, p. 220. Attempts at reconciliation John Fisher, the only cardinal recognised by the church as a martyr Many in Rome still thought reconciliation with England was possible, and Paul III elevated two English cardinals, John Fisher (at the time imprisoned and sentenced to death by Henry VIII) and Girolamo Ghinucci.Wilkie, 1974, p. 224. The execution of Fisher prompted Paul III to excommunicate and purportedly depose Henry VIII. While Campeggio lived, no attempt was made in Rome to fill any of the thirteen episcopal vacancies in England.Wilkie, 1974, p. 234. Queen Mary I of England briefly reconciled with Rome and appointed Reginald Pole as archbishop of Canterbury. However, \\"papal restoration in England was doomed even before it was accomplished\\" when Mary I married Philip II of Spain. In 1555, Pope Paul IV named a new cardinal protector, Giovanni Morone, but the queen did not confirm the nomination and Campeggio remained the last cardinal protector \\"chosen by the crown\\".Wilkie, 1974, p. 238. Meanwhile, loyalty to the pope became a defining feature of the movement for Irish nationalism and bishops appointed by the pope garnered a larger following than the hierarchy of the church of Ireland appointed by the crown.Wilkie, 1974, p. 239. According to Wilkie, \\"the cardinal protectors had assisted in the loss of England to the papacy, and Ireland remained loyal to the papacy in spite of them\\".

S. Thomas, was a Welsh poet and Anglican priest who was noted for his nationalism, spirituality and dislike of the anglicisation of Wales. John Betjeman, in his 1955 introduction to Song at the Year's Turning, the first collection of Thomas's poetry from a major publisher, predicted that Thomas would be remembered long after he himself was forgotten. M. Wynn Thomas said: \\"He was the Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn of Wales because he was such a troubler of the Welsh conscience. He was one of the major English language and European poets of the 20th century.\\" Life R. S. Thomas was born in Cardiff, the only child of Margaret (n√©e Davies) and Thomas Hubert Thomas. The family moved to Holyhead in 1918 because of his father's work in the Merchant Navy. He was awarded a bursary in 1932 to study at the University College of North Wales, where he read Latin. In 1936, after he completed his theological training at St Michael's College, Llandaff, he was ordained as a priest in the Anglican Church in Wales. From 1936 to 1940 he was the curate of Chirk, Denbighshire, where he met his future wife, Mildred \\"Elsi\\" Eldridge, an English artist. He subsequently became curate-in charge of Tallarn Green, Flintshire, as part of his duties as curate of Hanmer. In Hanmer he was an assistant to the Rev. Thomas Meredith-Morris, grandfather of the writer Lorna Sage, a fact later described by Byron Rogers as a \\"crossing of paths of two of Wales's strangest clergymen\\". Whilst Sage devotes a great deal of her autobiography Bad Blood to her late relative, she does not mention Thomas, who was in any case in Hanmer before Sage was born. However, her memoir gives some insight into the strange environment in which Thomas worked as a young priest.Lorna Sage (2001), Bad Blood, Fourth Estate. Thomas never wrote a great deal of his curacies and nothing is known of the relationship between him and Meredith-Morris.Byron G. Rogers (2006), The Man Who Went into the West: The Life of R. S. Thomas, London: Aurum. Thomas and Eldridge were married in 1940 and remained together until her death in 1991. Their son, (Andreas) Gwydion, was born on 29 August 1945 and died on 15 September 2016.The Man Who Went Into The West, Byron Rogers, p. 154. Gwydion often spoke about his difficult upbringing with a family living in near poverty, while he was sent to a number of traumatic boarding schools. The Thomas family lived on a tiny income and lacked the comforts of modern life, largely through their own choice. One of the few household amenities the family ever owned, a vacuum cleaner, was rejected because Thomas decided it was too noisy.Theodore Dalrymple, \\"A Man Out of Time: A life of poet R. S. Thomas entertains and illumines\\", a review of The Man Who Went into the West: The Life of R. S. Thomas, by Byron Rogers, in City Journal, 6 November 2006. Retrieved 30 December 2006. From 1942 to 1954 Thomas was rector of St Michael's Church, Manafon, near Welshpool in rural Montgomeryshire. It was during his time there that he first began to study Welsh and that he published his first three volumes of poetry, The Stones of the Field (1946), An Acre of Land (1952) and The Minister (1953). Thomas's poetry achieved a breakthrough with the publication in 1955 of his fourth book, Song at the Year's Turning, in effect a collected edition of his first three volumes. This was critically very well received and opened with Betjeman's famous introduction. His position was also helped by winning the Royal Society of Literature's Heinemann Award. St Hywyn's Church in Aberdaron where Thomas was vicar from 1967 to 1978 \\"To A Young Poet\\" by R. S. Thomas (Mashup) by Othniel Smith, read by Falstaff, Rice University Thomas learnt the Welsh language from the age of 30, ‚Äì too late in life, he said, to be able to write poetry in it. The 1960s saw him working in a predominantly Welsh- speaking community and he later wrote two prose works in Welsh, Neb (Nobody), an ironic and revealing autobiography written in the third person, and Blwyddyn yn Ll≈∑n (A Year in Ll≈∑n). In 1964 he won the Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry. From 1967 to 1978 he was vicar of St Hywyn's Church (built 1137) in Aberdaron at the western tip of the Ll≈∑n Peninsula. Thomas retired as a clergyman in 1978. He and his wife moved to Y Rhiw, into \\"a tiny, unheated cottage in one of the most beautiful parts of Wales, where, however, the temperature sometimes dipped below freezing,\\" according to Theodore Dalrymple. Free from church constraints, he was able to become more political and active in campaigns that were important to him. He became a fierce advocate of Welsh nationalism, although he never supported Plaid Cymru because they recognised the English Parliament and therefore, in his view, did not go far enough in opposition to England. Thomas was nominated for the 1996 Nobel Prize in Literature, the winner of which was Wislawa Szymborska. He received the 1996 Lannan Literary Award for Lifetime Achievement. Thomas died on 25 September 2000 aged 87, at his home in Pentrefelin near Criccieth, survived by his second wife, Elizabeth Vernon. He had been ill with a heart condition and treated at Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor until two weeks before he died. A memorial event celebrating his life and poetry was held at Westminster Abbey with readings from Heaney, Andrew Motion, Gillian Clarke and John Burnside. Thomas's ashes are buried near the door of St John's Church, Porthmadog, Gwynedd. Beliefs and contribution to spirituality=Religious views= Thomas's son, Gwydion, a resident of Thailand, recalls his father's sermons, in which he would \\"drone on\\" to absurd lengths about the evil of refrigerators, washing machines, televisions and other modern devices. Thomas preached that they were all part of the temptation of scrambling after gadgets rather than attending to more spiritual needs. \\"It was the Machine, you see,\\" Gwydion explained to a biographer. \\"This to a congregation that didn't have any of these things and were longing for them.\\" Although he may have taken some ideas to extreme lengths, Theodore Dalrymple wrote, Thomas \\"was raising a deep and unanswered question: What is life for? Is it simply to consume more and more, and divert ourselves with ever more elaborate entertainments and gadgetry? What will this do to our souls?\\" He had a reputation, which perhaps he cultivated, of being not always charitable and sometimes awkward and taciturn. Some critics have interpreted photographs of him as indicating he was \\"formidable, bad-tempered, and apparently humourless.\\" In terms of religion, although he sometimes appeared to lack charity and patience, Thomas served as a Church in Wales parish priest all his working life. His training at St Michael's College, Llandaff placed him somewhat in the Tractarian Tradition, though he does not seem to have been more than central in his position as regards the conduct of services.J. Wintle, 1997, Furious Interiors: Wales, RS Thomas and God, London: Flamingo. Although a fervent Welsh nationalist, he appears to have preferred the 1662 Book of Common Prayer of the Church of England (even in Welsh translation) over the 1966 order for the Holy Eucharist which the Church in Wales produced for itself and which came into use during his final year at Eglwys Fach. In one of his autobiographical books, he asserted that in retirement he could no longer bring himself to go to Holy Communion on account of the changes, although one of his successors at Aberdaron indicated that Thomas always retained the bishop's permission to officiate and occasionally did so at Llanfaelrhys, when no one else could be found.R. S. Thomas (1997), Autobiographies, (translated by Damian Walford Davies), London: Orion. His prime objection to the revised services was that since the Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì65) ‚Äì which also had liturgical repercussions within Anglicanism ‚Äì he could not bear to see the priest facing the people when in reality he should be leading the people towards God from the traditional east-facing position. \\"It is to God that the mystery belongs,\\" he wrote pointedly, \\"and woe to man when he interferes with that mystery. As T. S. Eliot says: 'Humankind cannot bear very much reality.'\\" Thomas seems early on to have become interested in Theosophy (an interest he did not pursue beyond some interfaith study) and over time he appears to have had some sympathy with the theological explorations of the one-time Bishop of Woolwich John A. T. Robinson in his 1963 Honest to God, on one occasion going as far as to describe the Resurrection of Christ as a \\"metaphor\\". In a letter to a theological student in 1993 he denied he held similar views to the non- realist Cambridge theologian and philosopher Don Cupitt. \\"I believe in revelation,\\" Thomas wrote, \\"and therefore one cannot describe all one's insights as entirely human.\\" Above all, his main influence appears to have been the philosopher Kierkegaard ‚Äì and his \\"leap of faith\\" ‚Äì although he also appears to have concerned himself with the limitations of religious language in an era becoming progressively more post-Christian in the face of science and philosophy. Yet for all his explorations, his sermons and practice as a priest do not seem to have been heterodox,B. Rogers (2006), The Man who Went into the West: the Life of R. S. Thomas, London: Aurum even if in retirement he was to write to his long-term friend, the poet Raymond Garlick,R. S. Thomas (2009), Letters to Raymond Garlick, Llandyssul: Gomer. to give him \\"the address of a retired Christian\\". As a priest, it seems that Thomas did not believe he was there to promote his own views, but those of the church he served, and for all his vaunted crabbiness, he seems to have been well enough regarded by parishioners, though biographies offer notable exceptions. He has been credited by some as a capable listener and counsellor at a time when such things were not common among the clergy, and to have been a devoted visitor to the sick. However, his tendency to remoteness led one of his successors to say that she had, as parish priest of Aberdaron, to \\"do a lot of healing\\". Nonetheless, his influence as a poet had a considerable impact on spirituality, to the extent that on the centenary of his birth, Archbishop of Wales, Barry Morgan, who had known the poet personally, paid tribute to him: > R. S. Thomas continues to articulate through his poetry questions that are > inscribed on the heart of most Christian pilgrims in their search for > meaning and truth. We search for God and feel Him near at hand, only then to > blink and find Him gone. This poetry persuades us that we are not alone in > this experience of faith ‚Äì the poet has been there before us. Other views Thomas believed in what he called \\"the true Wales of my imagination\\", a Welsh-speaking aboriginal community in tune with the natural world.R. S. Thomas (1997), edited and translated by Jason Walford Davies. Autobiographies. London: J. M. Dent, p. 10, cited in Tony Brown. R. S. Thomas. University of Wales Press, 2006. He viewed western (specifically English) materialism and greed, represented in the poetry by his mythical \\"Machine\\", as the destroyers of community. He could tolerate neither the English who bought up Wales and in his view stripped it of its wild and essential nature, nor the Welsh whom he saw as all too eager to kowtow to English money and influence.Tony Brown, R. S. Thomas. University of Wales Press, 2006. Thomas was an ardent supporter of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) and described himself as a pacifist, but also supported the terrorist Meibion Glynd≈µr fire bombings of English-owned holiday cottages in rural Wales. On this subject he said in 1998, \\"What is one death against the death of the whole Welsh nation?\\" He was also active in wildlife preservation and worked with the RSPB and Welsh volunteer organisations for the preservation of the red kite. He resigned his RSPB membership over their plans to introduce non- native kites to Wales. Works Almost all of Thomas's work concerns the Welsh landscape and the Welsh people, themes with both political and spiritual subtext. His views on the position of the Welsh people, as a conquered people are never far below the surface. As a cleric, his religious views are also present in his works. His earlier works focus on the personal stories of his parishioners, the farm labourers and working men and their wives, challenging the cosy view of the traditional pastoral poem with harsh and vivid descriptions of rural lives. The beauty of the landscape, although ever- present, is never suggested as a compensation for the low pay or monotonous conditions of farm work. This direct view of \\"country life\\" comes as a challenge to many English writers writing on similar subjects and challenging the more pastoral works of contemporary poets such as Dylan Thomas. Thomas's later works were of a more metaphysical nature, more experimental in their style and focusing more overtly on his spirituality. Laboratories of the Spirit (1975) gives, in its title, a hint at this development and also reveals Thomas's increasing experiments with scientific metaphor. He described this shift as an investigation into the \\"adult geometry of the mind\\". Fearing that poetry was becoming a dying art, inaccessible to those who most needed it, \\"he attempted to make spiritually minded poems relevant within, and relevant to, a science-minded, post-industrial world,\\" to represent that world both in form and in content even as he rejected its machinations.Daniel Westover, R. S. Thomas: A Stylistic Biography. University of Wales Press, 2011. Despite his nationalism Thomas could be hard on his fellow countrymen. Often his works read more as a criticism of Welshness than a celebration. He said there is a \\"lack of love for human beings\\" in his poetry. Other critics have been less harsh. Al Alvarez said, \\"He was wonderful, very pure, very bitter, but the bitterness was beautifully and very sparely rendered. He was completely authoritative, a very, very fine poet, completely off on his own, out of the loop but a real individual. It's not about being a major or minor poet. It's about getting a work absolutely right by your own standards and he did that wonderfully well.\\" Thomas's final works commonly sold 20,000 copies in Britain alone.

Verbanac worked as consultant for Forest City Enterprises and Harrah's Entertainment in their efforts to secure a casino license from the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board. The fact that he also was worked as an informal adviser to former Pittsburgh Mayor Bob O'Connor during that time raised questions of impropriety. Following his time on Capitol Hill, Verbanac entered into several entrepreneurial ventures and held a number of positions in other business endeavors. One of those positions was at Ketchum Communications Worldwide, a prominent public affairs firm, where he worked as vice president of public affairs. There, he handled the accounts for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, GNC, H. J. Heinz Company, Wal-Mart, and MCI Inc.. From 1997 to 2000, Verbanac worked as executive vice president of BrabenderCox, a Pennsylvania-based marketing and advertising firm. He helped the firm restructure and launch Adams Marketing, a new venture for BrabenderCox, of which he became president. He briefly became a partner in IdeaMill, a Pittsburgh-based branding and advertising firm. In 2001, he joined with journalist Albert J. Neri to found Neri-Verbanac Public Affairs, a Harrisburg-based public affairs agency. There, he helped develop The Insider, which became the \\"largest statewide political publication.\\" The firm was sold in 2005 and Verbanac and Neri parted ways. In 2005, Verbanac served as a director of the real estate arm of Summa Group, a financial company dealing with service and technology companies. In 2007, Joseph B.

Before any workers are hired on the project, construction unions have bargaining rights to determine the wage rates and benefits of all employees working on the particular project and to agree to the provisions of the agreement. The terms of the agreement apply to all contractors and subcontractors who successfully bid on the project, and supersedes any existing collective bargaining agreements. PLAs are used on both public and private projects, and their specific provisions may be tailored by the signatory parties to meet the needs of a particular project. The agreement may include provisions to prevent any strikes, lockouts, or other work stoppages for the length of the project. PLAs typically require that employees hired for the project are referred through union hiring halls, that nonunion workers pay union dues for the length of the project, and that the contractor follow union rules on pensions, work conditions and dispute resolution. PLAs are authorized under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 151-169. Sections 8(e) and (f) of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 158(e) and (f) make special exceptions from other requirements of the NLRA in order to permit employers to enter into pre-hire agreements with labor unions in the construction industry. The agreements have been in use in the United States since the 1930s, and first became the subject of debate in the 1980s, for their use on publicly funded projects. In these instances, government entities made signing PLAs a condition of working on taxpayer funded projects. This type of PLA, known as a government-mandated PLA, is distinct from a PLA voluntarily entered into by contractors on public or private work‚Äîas is permitted by the NLRA‚Äîas well as a PLA mandated by a private entity on a privately funded construction project. Executive orders issued since 1992 have affected the use of government-mandated PLAs for federal construction projects and the most recent order, issued by President Barack Obama in February 2009, encourages their use by federal agencies. The use of PLAs is opposed by a number of groups, who argue that the agreements discriminate against non-union contractors and do not improve efficiency or reduce costs of construction projects. Studies of PLAs have mixed results, with some studies concluding that PLAs have a favorable impact, while others find that the agreements can increase costs, and may negatively impact non-union contractors and workers. History=Early use= The earliest uses of Project Labor Agreements in the U.S. date back to several dam projects in the 1930s, including the Grand Coulee Dam in Washington, the Shasta Dam in California and the Hoover Dam in Nevada. Modern PLAs particularly developed from those used in construction carried out during World War II, a period when skilled labor was in demand, construction unions controlled 87% of the national market and government spending on construction had increased significantly over a short period of time. These early PLAs focused on establishing standard rates of pay and preventing work stoppages.Project Labor Agreements. John T. Dunlop, Harvard University Joint Center for Housing Studies (2002). PLA projects that followed included Cape Canaveral in the 1960s, Disney World from 1967‚Äì71 and the Trans- Alaska Pipeline from 1973-77. During this period and subsequently, the unionized share of the construction industry precipitously declined as construction users sought more open competition. By the 1980s, nonunion contractors claimed in excess of 80% of the construction work, in a wide variety of trades, with some variation in different parts of the country. =Boston Harbor and executive orders= The Boston Harbor reclamation project that began in the 1980s became the focus of debate over the legality of PLAs. When the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority elected to use a PLA for the project that mandated union-only labor, the Associated Builders and Contractors of Massachusetts/Rhode Island, Inc. challenged its legality, asserting that the use of a PLA was prohibited by the National Labor Relations Act. In 1990, the First Circuit federal appeals court ruled that the Boston Harbor PLA breached federal labor law because of its union-work requirement. On October 23, 1992, while the Boston Harbor case was still in court, President George H. W. Bush signed Executive Order 12818 prohibiting federal agencies from exclusively contracting union labor for construction projects. Bush's order prohibited the use of PLAs in federal construction projects. The Clinton administration rescinded this order when President Bill Clinton issued Executive Order 12836 in February 1993, shortly after he took office. This order allowed federal agencies to fund construction projects where contractors required a PLA. One month later, in the Boston Harbor cleanup case, the United States Supreme Court unanimously upheld the use of the agreements on public projects. The Supreme Court ruled that if the government was in the role of a regulator, it was not able to require PLA use under labor law preemption principles, however, it could choose to do so as a market participant without being preempted by the National Labor Relations Act. The Court did not address the separate question of whether government-mandated PLAs are lawful under federal or state competitive bidding laws. The decision led to increased use of PLAs in public-sector construction projects throughout the U.S. In 1997, Clinton proposed an executive order stating that federal agencies must consider use of PLAs for federally funded projects. Republicans staunchly opposed the move, believing it would restrict federal projects to union contractors only. Clinton abandoned the proposed executive order, but issued a memorandum on June 5, 1997, encouraging federal departments to consider the use of PLAs for ‚Äúlarge and significant‚Äù projects. The memorandum required that government agencies review each project to decide whether a PLA would allow the agency to increase efficiency and reduce costs. =Prohibition for federal projects= On February 17, 2001, President George W. Bush signed Executive Order 13202, ‚ÄúPreservation of Open Competition and Government Neutrality Towards Government Contractors‚Äô Labor Relations on Federal and Federally Funded Construction Projects‚Äù, prohibiting the use of PLAs for construction projects with federal funding.Executive Order No. 13202 This order stated that construction projects receiving federal funding would not be allowed to impose project labor agreements. Specifically, the order declared that neither the federal government, nor any agency acting with federal assistance, shall require or prohibit construction contractors to sign union agreements as a condition of performing work on federally funded construction projects. The order allowed any PLAs that had previously been agreed to continue, and did not affect projects that did not receive federal funding. Bush's order revoked the previous executive order affecting PLAs, Clinton's order 12836, which revoked the executive order issued by President George H.W. Bush in 1992. President George W. Bush issued an amendment in April 2001, allowing certain projects to be exempted from this order, if a contract had already been awarded under an existing PLA at the time of the order. In August 2001, U.S. District Court ruled Executive Order 13202 invalid in a case examining the use of a PLA by Maryland for the Woodrow Wilson Bridge replacement project. The court ruled that the order was invalid as it conflicted with the National Labor Relations Act. The judge issued a permanent injunction to block enforcement of the order on November 7, 2001. In July 2002, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia overturned the District Court's decision and ordered the removal of the injunction. Following this decision, the Department of Defense, NASA and the General Services Administration formally recognized the order in the Federal Register and implemented it in their construction bidding processes. Although the Court of Appeals decision in 2002 upheld the executive order prohibiting federal projects from using PLAs, individual states and counties were permitted to use PLAs for some public works where funding was from state and local revenue. These PLAs received opposition by organizations such as the Associated Builders and Contractors, and the Black Contractors Group. A notable example of pro-PLA legislation was passed in New Jersey, which enacted a law in 2002 allowing use of PLAs for some government funded projects. =PLA use since 2009= On February 6, 2009, President Barack Obama signed executive order 13502, which urges federal agencies to consider mandating the use of PLAs on federal construction projects costing $25 million or more on a case-by-case basis. This act served to revoke the Bush executive orders 13202 and 13208 from eight years earlier that prohibited government-mandated PLAs on federal and federally funded construction projects. The Obama order states that federal agencies can require a PLA if such an agreement will achieve federal goals in economy and efficiency. According to the terms of the order, non-union contractors may compete for contracts subject to PLAs, but they must agree to the various terms and conditions contained in each PLA in order to win a federal contract and build a project. A key change from the 2001 order is that by repealing the Bush orders, the Obama order permits recipients of federal funding, such as state, local and private construction owners, to mandate PLAs on public works projects of any size. However, the order does not encourage or mandate recipients of federal assistance to use a government-mandated PLA. With the February 2009 stimulus bill allocating approximately $140 billion for federal, state and local construction projects, battles over government-mandated PLAs on public works projects from 2009 to 2011 have been widespread at the state and local government level. Government officials and legislators have clashed over using PLA mandates on projects in states including Iowa, Oregon, Ohio, California, and others. Individual communities have voted on whether to prohibit the use of government-mandated PLAs on taxpayer funded construction projects, including ballot initiatives in Chula Vista, Oceanside, and in San Diego County, California in 2010, which resulted in officials being prohibited from mandating or prohibiting the use of PLAs for government projects. In 2011, contractors filed bid protests with the Government Accountability Office against government mandated PLAs for construction projects in New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C. These protests led to federal PLA mandates being removed from project solicitations in each case. At the state level, as of June 2019, through legislation or by executive order issued by the state governor, the following states have banned the requirement that PLAs be used for government funded construction projects: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. States with executive orders, or that have enacted legislation authorizing or encouraging the use of PLAs on public projects include California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Washington State. Debate over use There has been much debate over the government-mandated PLAs, particularly for publicly funded projects. The use of project labor agreements is supported by the construction unions, and some political figures, who state that PLAs are needed to ensure that large, complex projects are completed on time and on schedule. According to those who support the use of such agreements, PLAs enable project owners to control costs and ensure that there are no disruptions to the construction schedule, for example from strikes. In particular, proponents of PLAs point to the inclusion of clauses in the agreement that agree to establish labor management problem solving committees that deal with scheduling, quality control, health and safety, and productivity problems during the project. They also state that PLAs ensure that the workforce hired has received training and is of high quality. The use of PLAs in large private construction projects such as the building of the New England Patriots' Gillette Stadium, are given as examples of how PLAs help project owners meet tight deadlines, according to supporters. In addition to the stated benefits to project owners, supporters of PLAs also say that PLA use has a positive impact on local communities, through set goals for local hiring and provision of education. Groups including the Associated General Contractors of America (AGC), Associated Builders and Contractors (ABC), Construction Industry Roundtable (CIRT), National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), the National Black Chamber of Commerce, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have actively opposed the use of PLAs, particularly for government projects. These groups have challenged the use of such agreements through litigation, lobbying, public relations campaigns. Opponents of PLAs supported the Bush executive order prohibiting government-mandated PLAs, and have argued that between 2001 and 2008, when the executive order was in place, no federal projects suffered significant labor problems, delays or cost overruns attributable to the absence of PLAs. According to those who oppose PLAs, the agreements place restrictions on the hiring and working practices of contractors, and can lead to increased costs for project owners.Petitioner‚Äôs Opening Brief, Associated Builders and Contractors v. Metropolitan Water District, Supreme Court Case No. S067485, filed March 19, 1998, p. 18. One of their objections to PLAs is that the agreements require contractors to pay into union benefit plans and obey union work rules. In addition, they oppose the use of PLAs to restrict hiring on projects to construction workers selected by unions through union hiring halls, stating that this does not increase the quality of worker as all those who are licensed in a craft have at least the same level of education and skill, regardless of whether they belong to a union. Another point of debate is the proportion of construction workers who are unionized. According to opponents, under PLAs contractors must hire their workers through unions, and unionized workers are the majority of those who work on PLA projects, despite non-union workers making up the majority of the construction workforce. Estimates of the percentage of construction workers who are non-union, cited by opponents of PLAs, are around 85%, based on figures from the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics, and more recent data puts this figure at 86.9%. This figure is disputed by supporters of PLAs, who state that the figures given by those in opposition to PLAs are misleading and are based on census data that encompasses too broad a concept of a construction worker. According to a study by Cornell University in 2010, cited by Mary Vogel, executive director of the Construction Institute, In Massachusetts 60% of the Construction Trades is unionized. Since its inception in 1998, The Construction Institute, a non-profit organization is dedicated to the needs of the unionized construction sector in Massachusetts. A number of politicians do not agree with the use of the agreements for publicly funded construction projects, and have introduced bills or executive orders that prohibit using the agreements for government projects or prevent the use of public funds for projects using PLAs. These include Louisiana Senate Bill 76, introduced by Senator Danny Martiny, to prohibit state governments from requiring a PLA for projects with government funding. This bill was passed in June 2011, making Louisiana the 5th state in 2011 to ban government requirements that contractors use PLAs for publicly funded construction projects. =Impact on cost= A main argument has been the impact of PLAs on project cost. Those who oppose PLAs state that the agreements impact competition for project bids, reducing the number of potential bidders as non-union contractors are less likely to bid due to the potential restrictions a PLA would pose. According to opponents of the agreements, the reduced competition leads to higher bids and a higher cost for the project owner. In addition, opponents argue that the cost may also be increased due to contractors having greater expenses under a PLA. For example, according to Max Lyons of the Employee Policy Foundation, the cost of a project under a PLA is increased up to 7%, since contractors are required to pay their employees the union wage, rather than the government- determined prevailing wage. Opponents have also argued that there is evidence to show that PLA mandates add costs by forcing non-union contractors to pay into union benefit plans and their existing benefit plans. Supporters of PLA use argue that the end cost of projects is not increased if a PLA is in place, compared to projects without such an agreement, since the agreements prevent cost overruns. In response, opponents of the agreements cite examples of projects a PLA was in place and costs overran including Boston's Big Dig project, Safeco Field in Seattle, and the San Francisco International Airport. Three studies carried out on PLA use in school construction by the Beacon Hill Institute in 2003, 2004 and 2006, found that costs were increased by up to 20% in projects in Massachusetts, Connecticut and New York where PLAs were used. A 2009 study of PLAs use, carried out by Rider Levett Bucknall to determine whether PLAs should be used in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs' construction projects, found that costs would increase if PLAs are used for construction projects in locations where union membership is low. According to their analysis, in areas including Denver, Colorado, New Orleans, Louisiana, and Orlando, Florida, where unions do not have a great presence, use of PLAs for projects would lead to cost increases from 5% to 9%. In two cities, San Francisco and New York City, where unions have a great presence, the study predicted mixed results regarding potential cost savings ranging from small project cost increases to small cost savings. =Impact on competition= Opponents of PLAs state that the agreements impact competition for project bids, which can lead to higher costs. It is argued by those who oppose PLAs, such as former ABC president Henry Kelly, that PLAs discourage if not prevent non-unionized contractors from competing for construction projects, particularly federal projects. Competitive bidding statutes discourage public sector PLAs from discrimination between non-union and union contractors, as discrimination between bidders would typically represent a violation of such statutes.Jolie Siegel, PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS AND COMPETITIVE BIDDING STATUTES. University of Pennsylvania Journal of Labor and Employment Law. 3 U. Pa. J. Lab. & Emp. L. 295, 329. Non-union contractors have been awarded contracts on public sector PLA projects, for example the Boston Harbor project. In the United States Supreme Court ruling on the use of a PLA for the Boston Harbor project, it was stated that project owners are within their rights to choose a contractor who is willing to enter into a pre-hire agreement, and that contractors have a choice whether or not they wish to enter such an agreement. However, in a subsequent case the Supreme Court observed the following limitation on the Boston Harbor holding, \\"In finding that the state agency had acted as a market participant, we stressed that the challenged action \\"was specifically tailored to one particular job.\\"\\" PLAs often require all companies to obtain their workers from union hiring halls, though the union controlling this employee referral system may not discriminate on the basis of a worker's union or non-union status.John T. Callahan & Sons, Inc. v. City of Malden, 713 N.E.2d 955, 958 (Mass. 1999) ('The PLA mandates that this referral system be operated in a manner that is nondiscriminatory to non-union workers....') It is often the case, however, that the hired employees must join a union, usually for the duration of the project.Perritt, supra note 4, at 87; see generally Harms Constr. v. N.J. Tpk. Auth., 644 A.2d 76, 84 (N.J. 1994) (stating that under a PLA an employer recognizes a particular union as the bargaining representative and that any hired workers must join relevant union). PLA opponents argue that the union control of hiring prevents a non-union contractor for using its own employees. The increased cost to contractors and the impact on their workers of joining a union, is said by opponents of PLAs to discourage non-union contractors from bidding on projects with a PLA. For instance, a project in Ohio in 2010, to build dormitories for two schools saw an increased number of bids when a PLA was no longer required, and the bid prices were 22% lower than they had been when a PLA was in place. =Local impact= According to supporters, PLAs can be used by public project owners like school boards or city councils to set goals for creating local jobs and achieving social welfare goals through the construction projects they apply to. PLAs may include provisions for targeted hiring and apprenticeship ratio provisions. According to proponents, by including requirements for a certain proportion of local workers to enter union apprenticeship programs working on the construction program, PLAs can be used to help local workers gain skills. The term \\"Community Workforce Agreement\\" (CWA) may be used to describe PLAs with community-focused provisions., Proponents state that Community Workforce Agreements re-inject the tax dollars paying for these infrastructure projects back to the communities. Those who oppose PLAs have pointed to examples such as the construction of the Yankee Stadium and the Washington Nationals Ballpark, for both of which community focused agreements were in place but the goals of local hiring and resources to be provided to the community were not met. According to a report for the DC Sports & Entertainment Commission, the PLA for the Nationals Ballpark failed to meet its three main goals of local workers performing 50% of journeyman hours, apprenticeships provided to city residents only, and apprentices to carry out 25% of the work hours on the project. According to groups such as ABC, since the PLAs require that workers are hired through the unions and there are much fewer union workers, this can mean that meeting local hiring goals is impossible. =Impact on minority contractors= A number of women and minority contractor groups oppose project labor agreements, arguing that PLAs disproportionately impact small businesses, particularly those owned by women and minorities. These groups argue that PLAs are anti-free-market and discriminatory. In particular, groups including the National Association of Women Business Owners, have voiced their opposition to PLAs, and in 1998, there was a House hearing dedicated to the issue of minority groups' opposition to government-mandated PLAs. The National Black Chamber of Commerce opposes the use of PLAs due to the low numbers of black union members in the construction industry. According to the NBCC, implementing PLAs leads to discrimination against black workers who are generally non-union workers and also prevents contractors from using casual laborers. According to the United States Pan-Asian American Chamber of Commerce, the majority of their membership comprises small businesses that are unfairly impacted by PLAs, particularly due to increased costs and lowered employee benefits. Research and reports A number of studies and reports have been published, aiming at identifying the impact of PLAs. In addition to academic research, reports have been produced by government agencies and individuals on behalf of state or federal government. In 1998 the Government Accountability Office produced a report on PLAs that noted an overall lack of data but reported that both ‚Äúproponents and opponents of the use of PLAs said it would be difficult to compare contractor performance on federal projects with and without PLAs because it is highly unlikely that two such projects could be found that were sufficiently similar in cost, size, scope, and timing.‚Äù The GAO report concluded that it would be difficult to draw \\"any definitive conclusions\\" on the impact of PLAs on performance.Project Labor Agreements: The Extent of Their Use and Related Information. U.S. General Accounting Office, GAO/GGD-98-82, May 1998 More recent reports include a favorable study of PLAs from the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, in 2009, reports produced by the Beacon Hill Institute since 2003, which conclude that PLAs increase costs of projects, and an analysis published by the National University System Institute for Policy Research, which found that PLAs increased the cost of school construction in California. In addition to studies examining the use of PLAs and their impact, reports are available detailing the history of PLA use and the arguments for and against their use. Reports examining the history of PLA use, include a 2001 California State Library report, compiled for California State Senate, which recounts the history of PLAs in California and uses case studies to examine the features of public and private PLAs.Constructing California, A Review of Project Labor Agreements Johnson-Dodds, Kimberly (2002). At the request of California State Senator John Burton. In a 2001 University of Pennsylvania Journal of Law article, the author outlines the arguments on either side of PLAs and evaluates the state of the law since the 1993 Boston Harbor case decision. The article finds that while there are benefits to PLA use, they can present risks and should only be allowed on projects where they will further the goals of competitive bidding statutes, namely timely, efficient, high quality, and inexpensive construction.\\"Project Labor Agreements and Competitive Bidding Statutes\\" Jolie M. Siegel, University of Pennsylvania Journal of Labor and Employment Law, Volume 3, No. 2, Winter 2001, pp. 295-331. =Reports supporting PLAs= Studies have found that PLAs offer benefits to project owners and local communities, and do not disadvantage nonunion contractors and employees. A 2009 study by Fred B. Kotler, J.D., Associate Director of the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations found that there is no evidence that PLAs discriminate against employers and workers, limit the pool of bidders, and raise construction costs.‚ÄùProject Labor Agreements in New York State: In the Public Interest‚Äù. Fred B. Kotler, J.D. Associate Director, Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations. March, 2009. In a 2009 report by Dale Belman, of Michigan State University; Matthew M. Bodah of the University of Rhode Island and Peter Philips of the University of Utah, the authors stated that rather than increase cost, the agreements provide benefits to the community. According to their report, project cost is directly related to the complexity of a project, not the existence of an agreement. They found that PLAs are not suited to all projects, but some projects are good candidates for their use, such as highly complex construction projects.Belman, Bodah Phillips http://www.onlinecpi.org/downloads/PLA- report.pdf UCLA Labor Center, \\"Construction Careers for our Communities.‚Äù 2008 Studies have also considered how PLAs may benefit communities through hiring locals. In a paper focused on whether PLAs for projects developed by the Los Angeles Community College District (LACCD), the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), and the City of Los Angeles met local hiring goals, the author found that the goal of 30% local hires set by the PLAs was met. Reports and studies addressing the cost impact of PLAs on construction projects have found that they may not lead to greater costs, such as a 2002 paper by the Harvard University Joint Center for Housing Studies, which states that the increased costs cited by opponents of PLAs is based on bids rather than end costs. According to the paper, a project's end costs would usually be higher than bid costs due to expenses that arise during construction. In addition, a 2004 report by the Director of General Services for Contra Costa County, California reported that bids for five of eight projects subject to a PLA were lower than the architect/engineer cost estimate.Contra Costa County PLA report In 2004 a report written on the use of PLAs in Iowa states that PLA use increases efficiency and cost effectiveness of construction projects. \\"Public- sector PLAs on complex projects or projects where timely project completion is important have been shown to provide the performance desired by contractors and project managers, who repeatedly use them.\\" Project Labor Agreements in Iowa: An Important Tool for Managing Complex Public Construction Projects. Ralph Scharnau & Michael F. Sheehan, The Iowa Policy Project (2004). A 2009 paper concluded that there was difficulty in identifying the effect of PLAs on cost in construction of schools, due to the differences between schools built with PLAs and those built without them. The report stated that there was not any statistically significant evidence for an increase in costs for school construction.Project Labor Agreements‚Äô Effect on School Construction Costs in Massachusetts.

Cockshaw‚Äôs Construction Labor News+Opinion 31(11): 1. =Reports opposing PLAs= Several studies by the Beacon Hill Institute (BHI) at Suffolk University in Boston, Massachusetts have concluded that PLAs increase construction costs. Studies in 2003, 2004 and 2006 examining the impact of PLAs on school construction in Massachusetts, Connecticut and New York, respectively, found that where PLAs were in use construction costs were increased, even when controlling for the size of project and type of school. The September 2003 study by the institute found that use of PLAs created a cost increase of almost 14% increase compared to a non-PLA project. Beacon Hill Study Finds PLAs Increase Cost of School Projects in Massachusetts (September 2003) The following year their study of PLAs in Connecticut found that PLAs increased costs by nearly 18%. Beacon Hill Study Finds PLAs Increase Cost of School Projects in Connecticut (September 2004) A May 2006 study by BHI found that the use of PLAs on school construction projects in New York between 1996 and 2004 increased construction costs by 20%. This study controlled for the size of the project and type of school.Beacon Hill Study Finds PLAs Increase Cost of School Projects in New York (May 2006) A report on PLAs by BHI, published in 2009, examined whether claims made in Obama's executive order that PLAs have a positive economic impact are correct. The report considered the findings of the institute's studies, further case studies of PLA and non-PLA projects and addressed criticisms of their previous studies and concluded that the justifications for PLA use in the executive order were not proven. In particular the report concluded that there was no economic benefit to taxpayers in using PLAs. An independently-reviewed 2011 study by The National University System Institute for Policy Research analyzed the cost impact of PLAs on school construction in California from 1996 to 2008. The study analyzed 551 school construction projects and is reportedly the largest study of PLAs to have been undertaken to date. It found that the use of PLAs added between 13% and 15% to construction costs, which would represent a cost increase of between $28.90 and $32.49 per square foot when adjusted for inflation. However, this study's conclusions were strongly disputed by Dr. Dale Belman of Michigan State University, a long-time proponent of the use of PLAs and whose prior research it referenced repeatedly, and who claimed the study misrepresented his findings. He wrote the authors: \\"Although your study has several serious statistical issues, at the end of the day, your results are basically consistent with those presented in my article on PLAs and Massachusetts school construction costs. The take-away from your results can be summarized as follows: When appropriate controls are included for differences in the characteristics of schools built including school type and location, building specifications, materials used etc., there is no statistical evidence that PLA schools are more costly compared to non PLA schools.\\" The study authors point out in the report that they employed robust regression methods to account for variances in school construction materials/techniques and location. Robust regression is a statistical technique that is used in conjunction with predictive models when the data set lacks normal distribution, or when there are substantive outliers that may skew the results from a standard regression test. In a robust regression analysis, the influence of outliers is down- weighted, allowing more statistical relationships to appear in the results. In 2010, the New Jersey Department of Labor studied the impact of government- mandated PLAs on the cost of school construction in New Jersey during 2008, and also found that school construction projects where a PLA was used had higher costs, per square foot and per student, than those without a PLA. Earlier studies also found increased costs when PLAs were used, including a study in 2000 of a Nevada Water Authority project PLA, which found that the project cost an additional $200,000 because the true low bidder refused to sign the PLA. The project then went to a union contractor whose bid was $200,000 higher.Labor Agreements Research Study: Focus on Southern Nevada Water Authority (November 2000) Also in 2000, a study commissioned by the Jefferson County, New York Board of Legislators examining the potential use of a PLA for the Jefferson County Courthouse Complex concluded that a PLA could result in additional costs of more than $955,000. The total estimated increase of costs for the projects, should a PLA be used, would have represented 7% of the total cost of the project. Analysis of the Impacts on the Jefferson County (NY) Courthouse Complex through Project Labor Considerations (September 2000) In addition to increased costs of projects, studies have found that PLAs can lead to greater costs for nonunion contractors and can lower their employees' take home pay. A study was produced in 2009 by John R. McGowan of Saint Louis University, which found that nonunion workers on government projects with a PLA in place have reduced wages, compared with what they would receive for work on a non-PLA government project. In addition, nonunion employers would have to pay for additional benefits that their employees would be ineligible for and might be liable for pension fund withdrawal liability costs if the terms of the PLA mean they have to contribute to a union pension fund for the duration of the project. PLAs also may impact competition by discouraging nonunion bids, according to studies including a September 2001 study by Ernst & Young, commissioned by Erie County, New York. This study analyzed the impact of PLAs on public construction projects and concluded that the number of bidders was reduced for projects with a PLA, as \\"the use of PLAs strongly inhibits participation in public bidding by non-union contractors.\\" Erie County (NY) Courthouse Construction Projects: Project Labor Agreement Study (September 2001) The Worcester Municipal Research Bureau produced a report in 2001, based on a number of studies of PLA use. The report stated that PLAs reduced the number of bidders on construction projects, and led to lower savings than would be possible where contractors are able to work under their usual arrangements for employees. PLAs on Public Construction Projects: The Case For And Against (May 2001) In March 1995, an ABC study of the taxpayer costs for Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, New York, assessed bids for the same project both before and after a PLA was temporarily imposed in 1995. It revealed that there were 30% fewer bidders to perform the work and that costs increased by more than 26%. Roswell Park Cancer Institute Letters (March 1995) In terms of wider economic impact, a November 2000 Price Waterhouse Coopers study requested by the Los Angeles Unified School District was not able to confirm whether the project stabilization/labor agreement for the district's Proposition BB construction had produced either a positive or negative economic impact. Economic Evaluation of Project Stabilization Agreement For Construction Projects Funded Proposition BB (November 2000) In March 2006, the Public Interest Institute released a study that concludes that the PLA agreed for the construction of the Iowa Events Center project in downtown Des Moines, placed an ‚Äúunnecessary burden‚Äù on local workers, businesses and taxpayers.

Early life The youngest of five siblings of a Mennonite family from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Hugh Herr was a prodigy rock climber: by age eight, he had scaled the face of the Mount Temple in the Canadian Rockies, and by 17 he was acknowledged to be one of the best climbers in the United States. In January 1982, after having ascended a difficult technical ice route in Huntington Ravine on Mount Washington in New Hampshire, Herr and fellow climber Jeff Batzer were caught in a blizzard and became disoriented, finally descending into the Great Gulf where they passed three nights in degree temperatures. By the time they were rescued, the climbers had suffered severe frostbite. Both of Herr's legs had to be amputated below the knees; his companion lost his lower left leg, the toes on his right foot, and the fingers on his right hand. During the rescue attempt, volunteer Albert Dow was killed by an avalanche. Following months of surgeries and rehabilitation, Herr was doing what doctors told him was unthinkable: climbing again. Using specialized prostheses that he designed, he created prosthetic feet with high toe stiffness that made it possible to stand on small rock edges the width of a coin, and titanium-spiked feet that assisted him in ascending steep ice walls. He used these prostheses to alter his height to avoid awkward body positions and to grab hand and foot holds previously out of reach. His height could range from five to eight feet. As a result of using the prostheses, Herr climbed at a more advanced level than he had before the accident, making him the first person with a major amputation to perform in a sport on par with elite-level, able-bodied persons. Personal life Hugh Herr has two daughters, Alexandra and Sage. Under the direction and guidance of their mother, author Patricia Ellis Herr, both girls are accomplished hikers and trekkers. Alex's earliest hiking achievements are described in Patricia's memoir, Up: A Mother and Daughter's Peakbagging Adventure (Broadway Books, April 2012). Education After his climbing career, Herr began to focus on academics, previously an area of little interest to him. He earned an undergraduate degree in physics at his local college, Millersville University, and a master's degree in mechanical engineering at MIT, followed by a PhD in biophysics from Harvard University. Career Hugh Herr climbs the wall at the MIT Media Lab's h2.0 symposium on May 9, 2007 watched by fellow bilateral amputee Aimee Mullins While a postdoctoral fellow at MIT in biomedical devices, he began working on advanced leg prostheses and orthoses, devices that emulate the functionality of the human leg. Currently, Herr is a professor at the MIT Media Lab, where he directs the Biomechatronics research group and co-directs the MIT Center for Extreme Bionics. Within the Center, he focuses on developing wearable robotic systems that serve to augment human physical capability. Most of what he designs is not for him, but for others to whose difficulties he can relate. Herr has published over 120 peer-reviewed papers in the field of rehabilitation science and is the holder (or co-holder) of more than 100 patents related to assistive devices, including those for a computer-controlled artificial knee, commercially available as the Rheo Knee an active ankle-foot orthosis, and the world's first powered ankle-foot prosthesis. These devices are advancing an emerging field of engineering science that applies principles of biomechanics and neural control to guide the designs of human rehabilitation and augmentative devices. The goal is to rehabilitate individuals that have undergone limb amputation or have suffered a pathology, and also to augment human physical capability for those with normal intact physiologies. The computer-controlled knee, which is outfitted with a microprocessor that continually senses the joint's position and the loads applied to the limb, was named to the list of Top Ten Inventions in the health category by TIME magazine in 2004. The robotic ankle-foot prosthesis, which mimics the action of a biological leg and, for the first time, provides transtibial amputees with a natural gait, was named to the same TIME top-ten list in 2007. TED 2014, where he first demonstrated a running gait under neural command. In 2007, Herr was presented with the 13th Annual Heinz Award for Technology, the Economy and Employment. He is also the recipient of the Popular Mechanics Breakthrough Leadership Award (2005). Herr was a member of a team of seven experts in biomechanics and physiology from six universities that conducted research on the mechanics of Oscar Pistorius' running blades. The South African bilateral amputee track athlete was banned by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) from running in able-bodied events, as previous research had shown the blades gave him a competitive advantage. A portion of these results were presented to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Lausanne, Switzerland in May 2008, by Herr and colleague Rodger Kram which resulted in reversing the ban. This allowed Pistorius to become the first disabled sprint runner to qualify against able- bodied athletes for an Olympic event. The full findings of the team's experiments were published in the June 18, 2009 issue of the Journal of Applied Physiology. Herr's story has been told by Alison Osius in the book Second Ascent: The Story of Hugh Herr; a Discovery Channel feature story; and in a 2002 National Geographic movie, Ascent: The Story of Hugh Herr. Herr was featured on a March 25, 2012 episode of CNN's The Next List.

B. (2004). Marcos, Subcomandante. In D. Coerver, S. Pasztor & R. Buffington, Mexico: An encyclopedia of contemporary culture and history. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, and an anti-capitalist and anti-neoliberal globalization icon. Widely known by his initial nom de guerre Subcomandante Insurgente Marcos (frequently shortened to simply Subcomandante Marcos), he has subsequently employed several other pseudonyms: he called himself Delegate Zero during the Other Campaign (2006‚Äì7), and since May 2014 has gone by the name Subcomandante Insurgente Galeano (again, frequently with the \\"Insurgente\\" omitted), which he adopted in honor of his fallen comrade \\"Teacher Galeano\\". Marcos bears the title and rank of Subcomandante (or \\"Subcommander\\" in English), as opposed to Comandante (or \\"Commander\\" in English), because, he is subordinate to, and under the command of, the indigenous commanders who constitute the EZLN‚Äôs Clandestine Revolutionary Indigenous Committee's General Command (CCRI-CG in Spanish). Born in Tampico, Tamaulipas, Marcos earned a degree from the Faculty of Philosophy and Literature at the presitigious National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), and taught at the Autonomous Metropolitan University (UAM) for several years during the early 1980s. During this time he became increasingly involved with a guerrilla group known as the National Liberation Forces (FLN), before leaving the university and moving to Chiapas in 1984. The Ej√©rcito Zapatista de Liberaci√≥n Nacional (EZLN) (Zapatista Army of National Liberation; often simply called the Zapatistas) was the local, Chiapas wing of FLN, founded in the Lacandon Jungle in 1983, initially functioning as a self-defense unit dedicated to protecting Chiapas's Mayan people from evictions and encroachment on their land. While not Mayan himself, Marcos emerged as the group's military leader, and when the EZLN, acting independently of the FLN, began its rebellion on 1 January 1994, he served as its spokesman. Known for his trademark ski mask and pipe and for his charismatic personality, Marcos coordinated the EZLN's 1994 uprising, headed up the subsequent peace negotiations, and has played a prominent role throughout the Zapatistas' struggle in the following decades. After the ceasefire the government declared on day 12 of the revolt, the Zapatistas transitioned from revolutionary guerrillas to an armed social movement, with Marcos‚Äôs role transitioning from military strategist to public relations strategist. He became the Zapatistas‚Äô spokesperson and interface with the public, penning communiques, holding press conferences, hosting gatherings, granting interviews, delivering speeches, devising plebiscites, organizing marches, orchestrating campaigns and twice touring Mexico, all with the aim to attract national and international media attention and public support for the Zapatistas. In 2001, he headed a delegation of Zapatista commanders to Mexico City to deliver their message on promoting indigenous rights before the Mexican Congress, attracting widespread public and media attention. In 2006, Marcos made another public tour of Mexico, which was known as The Other Campaign. In May 2014, Marcos stated that the persona of Subcomandante Marcos had been \\"a hologram\\" and no longer existed. Many media outlets interpreted the message as Marcos retiring as the Zapatistas' military leader and spokesman. Marcos is also a prolific writer, and hundreds of communiques and several books are attributed to him. Most of his writings are anti-capitalist while advocating for indigenous people's rights, but he has also written poetry, children's stories, folktales and has co-authored a crime novel. He has been hailed by R√©gis Debray as \\"the best Latin American writer today\\", and his considerable literary talents have been widely acknowledged by prominent writers and intellectuals. Published translations of his writings exist in at least fourteen languages.See Subcomandante Marcos bibliography Early life Guill√©n was born on 19 June 1957, in Tampico, Tamaulipas, to Alfonso Guill√©n and Maria del Socorro Vincente. He was the fourth of eight children. A former elementary school teacher, Alfonso owned a local chain of furniture stores, and the family is usually described as middle-class. In a 2001 interview with Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez and Roberto Pombo, Guill√©n described his upbringing as middle-class, \\"without financial difficulties\\", and said his parents fostered a love for language and reading in their children.The Punch Card and the Hourglass by Garc√≠a M√°rquez and Roberto Pombo, New Left Review, May ‚Äì June 2001, Issue 9 While still \\"very young\\", Guill√©n came to know of, and admire, Che Guevara Interview with Raymundo Reynoso (2007) http://www.cedoz.org/site/content.php?doc=518; quoted and translated in Nick Henck, \\"Subcomandante Marcos: The Latest Reader.\\" The Latin Americanist, Vol. 58, No. 2 (June 2014): 49-73, at p. 50.‚Äî an admiration that would persist throughout his adulthood. Guill√©n attended high school at the Instituto Cultural Tampico, a Jesuit school in Tampico. A discussion of Marcos's background and views. Marcos says his parents were both schoolteachers and mentions early influences of Cervantes and Garc√≠a Lorca. An abbreviated version of the Cambio article, in English. Later he moved to Mexico City and graduated from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), majoring in philosophy. There he became immersed in the school's pervasive Marxist rhetoric of the 1970s and 1980s and won an award for the best dissertation (drawing on the then-recent work of Althusser and Foucault) of his class. He began working as a professor at the Autonomous Metropolitan University (UAM) while finishing his dissertation at UNAM, but left after a couple of years. It is thought that it was at UAM where he came into contact with, and subsequently joined the ranks of, with the Forces of National Liberation, the Maoist mother organization of what would later become the EZLN. In 1984, he abandoned his academic career in the capital and left for the mountains of Chiapas to convince the poor, indigenous Mayan population to organize and launch a proletarian revolution against the Mexican bourgeoisie and the federal government.Farewell to the End of History: Organization and Vision in Anti-Corporate Movements by Naomi Klein, The Socialist Register, 2002, London: Merlin Press, 1‚Äì14 After hearing his proposition, the Chiapanecans \\"just stared at him,\\" and replied that they were not urban workers, and that from their perspective the land was not property, but the heart of the community. In the documentary A Place Called Chiapas (1998), about his early days there, Subcommander Marcos said: Debate exists as to whether Marcos visited Nicaragua in the years soon following the Sandinista Revolution that took place there in 1979, and, if he did, how many times and in what capacity. He is rumored to have done so, although no official documents (for example, immigration records) have been discovered to attest to this. Nick Henck argues that Guill√©n \\"may have journeyed\\" to Nicaragua, although to him the evidence appears \\"circumstantial\\". Fernando Meisenhalter, drawing for the most part on the same evidence, is convinced that at least one trip, for non-military purposes, took place in 1980, and that a second, \\"very likely\\" involving \\"full military training\\", may also have been undertaken by Marcos \\"in 1982\\". Guill√©n's sister Mercedes Guill√©n Vicente is the Attorney General of the State of Tamaulipas, and an influential member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party. The Zapatista Uprising= Marcos‚Äôs Debut = Marcos made his debut on 1 January 1994, the first day of the Zapatista uprising.The fullest account of the Subcommander‚Äòs actions on 1 January appears in Nick Henck, Subcommander Marcos: the Man and the Mask (Durham, NC, 2007), pp. 202ff; and Nick Henck, \\"Laying a Ghost to Rest: Subcommander Marcos's Playing of the Indigenous Card\\". Estudios Mexicanos/Mexican Studies. 25 (1) (Winter 2009), pp. 155-170. See too, however, John Ross Rebellion from the Roots (Monroe, ME, 1995), pp. 16f; Andres Oppenheimer, Bordering on Chaos. Boston: [1996] 1998), pp. 21-23; and Subcomandante Marcos, Our Word is Our Weapon. Juana Ponce de Le√≥n (ed.), (New York, 2001), pp. 9-10. According to Marcos, his first encounter with the public and the press, occurred by accident, or at least was not premeditated. Initially, his role was to have been to secure the police headquarters in San Crist√≥bal de las Casas. However, with the wounding of a subordinate, whose duty it was to transport the weapons just captured from the police station to the central town square where most the of Zapatista troops were amassed, Marcos took his place and headed there instead. As a group of foreign tourists formed around Marcos, the only English-speaking Zapatista at hand, others, including members of the press, joined the throng. Marcos spent from 8 a.m. until 8 p.m., intermittently interacting with tourists, townsfolk, and reporters, and gave four interviews. From this initial spark, Marcos‚Äôs fame would spread like wildfire. As Henck notes: \\"The first three months of 1994...saw the Subcomandante...giving 24 interviews (i.e. an average of two a week); and participating in ten days of peace negotiations with the government, during which he also held nine press conferences reporting on the progress being made...\\" In the coming months Marcos would be interviewed by Ed Bradley for 60 Minutes be featured in Vanity Fair . He would also devise, convoke and host of the August 1994 National Democratic Convention that brought together 6000 members of civil society to discuss how to organize peaceful struggle that aimed to make Mexico freer, more just and more democratic. =The February 1995 Government military offensive= Main Article: 1995 Zapatista Crisis Subcomandante Marcos (center, wearing brown cap) in Chiapas In early 1995, while the Secretary of Interior Esteban Moctezuma was, in good faith, reaching out to Marcos and the Zapatistas to arrange talks aimed at bringing peace to Chiapas, Mexico's Attorney General's Office (PGR) learned of the true identity of Subcomandante Marcos from a former-subcommander-turned-traitor Subcomandante Daniel (alias Salvador Morales Garibay).El otro subcomandante On 9 February 1995, President Ernesto Zedillo, armed with this recently acquired information, publicly announced that Subcomandante Marcos had been identified as Rafael Sebasti√°n Guill√©n Vicente, and immediately ordered the Mexican military to go on the offensive and capture or annihilate Marcos and the Zapatistas. Arrest warrants were issued for Marcos, as well as other key figures in the FLN and EZLN, and Zapatista territory in the Lacandon Jungle was invaded by the Mexican Army. This sudden betrayal of both the truce proclaimed by President Carlos Salinas a year previously and the secret peace negotiations currently being undertaken by Secretary of Interior Esteban Moctezuma, provoked responses from several protagonists that, combined, forced Zedillo to promptly call off the military offensive: First, Moctezuma tendered his resignation to Zedillo, who refused it and asked Moctezuma to try to restore conditions that would allow for dialogue and negotiation. Second, civil society rallied to Marcos' and the Zapatistas' defense, organizing three massive demonstrations in Mexico City in one week. One of these rallies was attended by 100,000 people, some of whom chanted \\"We Are All Marcos\\" as they marched. Third, Marcos himself capitalized on this sudden, hostile action, issuing some eloquent communiques in which he lambasted the government's treachery, or at least duplicity, and portrayed himself as self-effacing mock heroic guerrilla. Marcos would later tell an interviewer: \\"It's after the betrayal of '95 that people remember us: Then the [Zapatista] movement took off\\". Finally, it prompted Max Appedole, Rafael Guill√©n's childhood friend and fellow student at the Instituto Cultural Tampico, to approach Ed√©n Pastora, the legendary Nicaraguan \\"Commander Zero\\", to help in preparing a report for Under-Secretary of the Interior Luis Maldonado Venegas, Secretary Moctezuma, and President Zedillo, emphasizing Marcos's pacifist disposition and the unintended, detrimental consequences of a military solution to the Zapatista crisis. The document concluded that the complaints of marginalized groups and the radical left in M√©xico had been vented through the Zapatistas movement, while Marcos remained open to negotiation. If Marcos were eliminated, his function as a safety-valve for social discontent would cease and more-radical groups could take his place. These groups would respond to violence with violence, threatening terrorist bombings, kidnappings and even more belligerent activities, and so the country would then be plunged into a very dangerous downward spiral, with discontent surfacing in areas other than Chiapas. Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) insurgents in MexicoAs a result, on 10 March 1995 Zedillo and Moctezuma signed into Chiapas Law the \\"Presidential Decree for the Dialogue, Reconciliation and Peace with Dignity\\", which was subsequently debated and approved by the Mexican Congress. Meanwhile, Moctezuma sent Maldonado to enter into direct peace negotiations with the Zapatistas on behalf of the Zedillo government, and these talks took place commencing April 3rd. By 9 April 1995, the basis for the Dialogue Protocol and the \\"Harmony, Peace with Justice and Dignity Agreement\\" negotiated between the Mexican government and the Zapatistas was signed. On 17 April, the Mexican government appointed Marco Antonio Bernal as Peace Commissioner in Chiapas, and peace talks began in San Andr√©s Larr√°inzar on 22 April.

Of Marcos's writings, Jorge Alonso claims, \\"With over 10,000 citations, he has also made a dent in the academic world. Marcos‚Äô writings, as well as books based on him, have been referenced by a large number of researchers from different countries and in several languages.\\" Much has been written about Marcos's literary style, in particular its poetic nature and his use of humor, especially irony.See: Henck, Nick (2019).

Oakland, CA: A.K. Press. . On Marcos' use of irony, see Daniela Di Piramo, \\"Beyond Modernity: Irony, Fantasy, and the Challenge to Grand Narratives in Subcomandante Marcos‚Äôs Tales.\\" Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos 27, no. 1 (2011): 177‚Äì205; and Kristine Vanden Berghe, \\"The Carcaol and the Beetle: A Tension between Ideology and Form in the EZLN.\\" KAMCHATKA. REVISTA DE AN√ÅLISIS CULTURAL 12 (2018), pp. 213-216:https://ojs.uv.es/index.php/kamchatka/article/view/12357/12355. He generally appears to prefer indirect expression, and his writings often take the form of fables or allegorical children's stories, though some are more earthy and direct. In a January 2003 letter to Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (the Basque ETA separatist group) titled \\"I Shit on All the Revolutionary Vanguards of This Planet\\", Marcos wrote, \\"We teach [children of the EZLN] that there are as many words as colors and that there are so many thoughts because within them is the world where words are born...And we teach them to speak with the truth, that is to say, to speak with their hearts.\\" La Historia de los Colores (The Story of Colors) is on the surface a children's story, and is one of Marcos's most-read books. Based on a Mayan creation myth, it teaches tolerance and respect for diversity. The book's English translation was to be published with support from the U.S. National Endowment for the Arts, but in 1999 the grant was abruptly canceled after a reporter brought the book's content and authorship to NEA chairman William J. Ivey's attention. This article was retitled \\"N.E.A. Couldn't Tell a Mexican Rebel's Book by Its Cover\\" in late editions. The Lannan Foundation stepped in and provided support after the NEA withdrew. In 2005, Marcos wrote the detective story The Uncomfortable Dead with the whodunit writer Paco Ignacio Taibo II. This crime novel bears \\"a pro- ecology, pro-democracy, anti-discriminatory (racial, gender, and sexual orientation), anti-neoliberal globalization, and anti-capitalist\\" message. The political philosophy espoused by Marcos and the Zapatistas, sometimes called neozapatismo, is often characterized as Marxist, and his writings, which express strong criticism of the neglect, exploitation and oppression of people by both business and the State, underline some of the commonalities that Zapatista thinking shares with Libertarian socialism and Anarchism. Some of Marcos‚Äôs works that best articulate his political philosophy include \\"The Fourth World War Has Begun\\" (1997), alternatively titled \\"Seven Loose Pieces of The Global Jigsaw Puzzle\\"; \\"The Fourth World War\\" (1999); The Sixth Declaration of the Lacandon Jungle (2005); the four-part \\"Zapatistas and the Other: The Pedestrians of History\\" (2006)See: http://www.elkilombo.org/documents/peatonesI.html, http://www.ainfos.ca/06/sep/ainfos00259.html, http://www.elkilombo.org/documents/pedestrians3.html, and http://www.elkilombo.org/documents/pedestrians4.html. ; and Marcos‚Äôs presentations in Critical Thought in the Face of the Capitalist Hydra and The Zapatistas‚Äô Dignified Rage: Final Public Speeches of Subcommander Marcos. Flag of the EZLNMarcos's literary output serves a political purpose, and even performs a combative function, as suggested in a 2002 book titled Our Word is Our Weapon, a compilation of his articles, poems, speeches, and letters.On Marcos' use of words as weapons, see: Henck, Nick (2019). Subcomandante Marcos: Global Rebel Icon. Black Rose Books. pp. 52‚Äì54. ; and Henck, Nick (2017). Insurgent Marcos: The Political-Philosophical Formation of the Zapatista Subcommander. Raleigh, N.C.: Editorial A Contracorriente. pp. 168-171. . =Fourth World War= Marcos has also written an essay in which he claims that neoliberalism and globalization constitute the \\"Fourth World War\\".The Fourth World War Has Begun by Subcomandante Marcos, trans. Nathalie de Broglio, Neplantla: Views from South, Duke University Press: 2001, Vol. 2 Issue 3: 559‚Äì572 He termed the Cold War the \\"Third World War\\". In this piece, Marcos compares and contrasts the Third World War (the Cold War) with the Fourth World War, which he says is the new type of war we find ourselves in now: \\"If the Third World War saw the confrontation of capitalism and socialism on various terrains and with varying degrees of intensity, the fourth will be played out between large financial centers, on a global scale, and at a tremendous and constant intensity.\\" He goes on to claim that economic globalization has caused devastation through financial policies: > Toward the end of the Cold War, capitalism created a military horror: the > neutron bomb, a weapon that destroys life while leaving buildings intact. > During the Fourth World War, however, a new wonder has been discovered: the > financial bomb. Unlike those dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, this new > bomb not only destroys the polis (here, the nation), imposing death, terror, > and misery on those who live there, but also transforms its target into just > another piece in the puzzle of economic globalization. Marcos explains the effect of the financial bombs as \\"destroying the material bases of their [nation-state's] sovereignty and, in producing their qualitative depopulation, excluding all those deemed unsuitable to the new economy (for example, indigenous peoples)\\". He also believes that neoliberalism and globalization result in a loss of unique culture for societies as a result of the homogenizing effect of neo-liberal globalization: > All cultures forged by nations ‚Äì the noble indigenous past of America, the > brilliant civilization of Europe, the wise history of Asian nations, and the > ancestral wealth of Africa and Oceania ‚Äì are corroded by the American way of > life. In this way, neoliberalism imposes the destruction of nations and > groups of nations in order to reconstruct them according to a single model. > This is a planetary war, of the worst and cruelest kind, waged against > humanity. It is in this context that Marcos believes that the EZLN and other indigenous movements across the world are fighting back. He sees the EZLN as one of many \\"pockets of resistance\\". > It is not only in the mountains of southeastern Mexico that neoliberalism is > being resisted. In other regions of Mexico, in Latin America, in the United > States and in Canada, in the Europe of the Maastricht Treaty, in Africa, in > Asia, and in Oceania, pockets of resistance are multiplying. Each has its > own history, its specificities, its similarities, its demands, its > struggles, its successes. If humanity wants to survive and improve, its only > hope resides in these pockets made up of the excluded, the left-for-dead, > the 'disposable'.  Latin America's Pink Tide and being a Revolutionary vs being a Rebel  Marcos's views on Latin American leaders who formed the continent's Pink Tide are complex. For example, in interviews he gave in 2007 he signaled his approval of Bolivian president Evo Morales, but expressed mixed feelings toward Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, whom he labels \\"disconcerting\\" and views as too militant, but nonetheless responsible for vast revolutionary changes in Venezuela. He also called Brazil's former president Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva and Nicaragua's current president Daniel Ortega, whom he once served under while a member of the Sandinistas, traitors who have betrayed their original ideals. In another interview, given to Jes√∫s Quintero the previous year, however, when asked what he thought about the \\"pre-revolutionary situation\\" then existing in Latin America, and specifically about \\"Evo Morales. Hugo Chavez, Fidel Castro, etcetera\\", Marcos replied: > We are interested in those of below, not in the governments, nor in Chavez, > nor in Kirchner, nor in Tabar√©, nor in Evo, nor in Castro. We are interested > in the processes which are taking place among the people, among the peoples > of Latin America, and especially, out of natural sympathy, we are interested > when these movements are led by Indian peoples, as is the case in Bolivia > and in Ecuador‚Ä¶We say: ‚ÄúGovernments come and go, the people remain‚Äù‚Ä¶Chavez > will last for a time, Evo Morales will last for a time, Castro will last for > a time, but the peoples, the Cuban people, the Bolivian people, the > Argentine, the Uruguayan, will go on for a much longer time‚Ä¶ This emphasis on bottom-up (as opposed to top-down) politics, and concentrating on the people over leaders, even leftwing or revolutionary ones, connects with Marcos's stance on revolution and revolutionaries. In the interview with Quintero mentioned above, when asked \\"...what does it mean to be revolutionary today?\\", Marcos responded: > The problem with being revolutionary is that the taking of power must be > considered and one must think that things can be transformed from above. We > do not think that: we think that society, and the world, should be > transformed from below. We think we also have to transform ourselves: in our > personal relations, in culture, in art, in communication‚Ä¶and create another > kind of society‚Ä¶ Ultimately, this has led Marcos to reject the label \\"revolutionary\\", preferring instead to self-identify as a \\"rebel\\", because > ‚Äú‚Ä¶a revolutionary proposes fundamentally to transform things from above, not > from below, the opposite to a social rebel. The revolutionary appears: We > are going to form a movement, I will take power and from above will > transform things. But not so the social rebel. The social rebel organizes > the masses and from below, transforming things without the question of the > seizure of power having to be raised.In Marcos‚Äô interview with Julio > Scherer, ‚ÄúLa entrevista ins√≥lita,‚Äù Proceso no. 1271, March 11, 2001, 14‚Äì15; > quoted and translated Henck, Nick (2017). Insurgent Marcos: The Political- > Philosophical Formation of the Zapatista Subcommander. Raleigh, N.C.: > Editorial A Contracorriente. p. 173 . Elsewhere, in a communiqu√©, Marcos elaborates on what distinguishes a revolutionary from a rebel, noting how the revolutionary > ...throws off whomever is sitting on the chair [of power] with one shot, > sits down and ‚Ä¶ [t]here he remains until another Revolutionary ‚Ä¶ comes by, > throws him off and history ‚Ä¶ repeats itself‚Ä¶[T]the rebel...on the other > hand...runs into the Seat of Power‚Ä¶, looks at it carefully, analyzes it, but > instead of sitting there he goes and gets a fingernail file and, with heroic > patience, he begins sawing at the legs until they are so fragile that they > break when someone sits down, which happens almost immediately. Despite his preference for rebels over revolutionaries however, Marcos has nevertheless expressed admiration for both Fidel Castro and Che Guevara. Popularity Marcos‚Äôs popularity was at its height during the first seven years of the Zapatista uprising, arguably reaching its zenith in 2001 with the March of the Color of the Earth (a.k.a. the March for the Indigenous Dignity) that year.On this March, see: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/26/jotuckman, https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-feb-26-mn-30429-story.html & https://www.alainet.org/en/active/1189 Subcomandante Marcos featured on assorted magazine covers Subcomandante Marcos on assorted book & dvd covers That period, 1994‚Äì2001, saw reporters from all over the world coming to interview Marcos and do features on him. He was also courted by numerous famous figures and literati (e.g. Oliver Stone, Naomi Klein, Danielle Mitterrand, Regis Debray, Manuel V√°zquez Montalb√°n, Juan Gelman, Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, Jos√© Saramago), and engaged in exchanges of letters with eminent intellectuals and writers (e.g. John Berger, Carlos Fuentes, Eduardo Galeano). Zapatista events Marcos presided over were attended by people from all over the world by the thousands, including media organizations, and he appeared on the front pages of innumerable magazines, and on the covers of many books and DVDs. When, in February 1995, the Mexican government revealed Marcos‚Äôs true identity and issued an arrest warrant for him, thousands marched through the streets of Mexico City chanting \\"We are all Marcos.\\" The following year (1996), saw a surge in the Subcommander's popularity and exposure in the media. He was visited by Oliver Stone, Danielle Mitterrand and R√©gis Debray, and he acted as host at the Intercontinental Encuentro For Humanity and Against Neoliberalism, which drew around 5,000 participants from 50 countries, including documentary makers, academics and reporters, some of whom published the interviews that Marcos granted them on the event's sidelines. The Subcommander also proved popular with certain musicians and bands. For example, Rage Against the Machine, the Mexican rock band Tijuana No!, Mexican singer-songwriter √ìscar Ch√°vez and French Basque singer-songwriter Manu Chao expressed their support for Marcos, and in some cases incorporated recordings of his speeches into their songs or concerts. Marcos experienced a general uptick in popularity in 2006 when he toured Mexico on the Other Campaign. On this trek to the capital he was welcomed by \\"huge adoring crowds, chanting and whistling\\", while \\"Marcos handcrafted dolls, and his ski mask-clad face adorns T-shirts, posters and badges.\\"BBC Profile: The Zapatistas' mysterious leader by Nathalie Malinarich, 11 March 2001 By 2011, Mexican historian Enrique Krauze wrote that \\"Marcos [has] remained popular among young Mexicans, but as a celebrity, not as a role model\\". In May 2014, Marcos gave a speech in front of several thousand onlookers as well as independent media organizations in which, among other things, he explained that because back in 1994 \\"those outside [the movement] did not see us‚Ä¶the character named 'Marcos' started to be constructed\\", but that there came a point when \\"Marcos went from being a spokesperson to being a distractor\\", and so, convinced that \\"Marcos, the character, was no longer necessary\\", the Zapatistas chose to \\"destroy it\\". Marcos has been compared to popular figures such as England‚Äôs folklore hero Robin Hood, Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata, Argentine guerrilla Che Guevara, India‚Äôs pacifist independence leader Mahatma Gandhi, South African anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela, and even U.S. president John F. Kennedy in the 1960s, on account of his \\"popularity in virtually all sectors of Mexican society.\\" Marcos is often credited with putting Mexico's indigenous population's poverty in the spotlight, both locally and internationally. His popularity also served the Zapatista cause well in two very concrete ways. Most immediately, it deprived the Mexican government of the option of militarily crushing them. Second, Marcos was able to capitalize on his popularity to win public support, garner international solidarity, and attract media attention to the Zapatistas. Marcos has continued to attract media attention, and to be seen both in the company of celebrities and as a celebrity himself. For example, he was photographed alongside Mexican actors Gael Garc√≠a and Ilse Salas in November 2018, and Diego Luna in December 2019. Relationship with Inter Milan Apart from cheering for local Liga MX side Chiapas F.C., which relocated to Quer√©taro in 2013, Subcomandante Marcos and the EZLN also support the Italian Serie A club Inter Milan. The contact between EZLN and Inter, one of Italy's biggest and most famous clubs, began in 2004 when an EZLN commander contacted a delegate from Inter Campus, the club's charity organization which has funded sports, water, and health projects in Chiapas. In 2005, Inter's president Massimo Moratti received an invitation from Subcomandante Marcos to have Inter play a football game against a team of Zapatistas with Diego Maradona as referee. Subcomandante Marcos asked Inter to bring the match ball because the Zapatistas' ones were punctured. Although the proposed spectacle never came to fruition, there has been continuing contact between Inter and the Zapatistas. Former captain Javier Zanetti has expressed sympathy for the Zapatista cause.

It is an example of the diffusion of Renaissance ch√¢teau architecture from the Loire Valley into other parts of France. History Built between 1518 and 1535, the ch√¢teau was commissioned by Jacques Galiot de Genouillac (1465‚Äì1546), Grand Squire of France under King Fran√ßois I. The ch√¢teau was designed as a large quadrangle, on each side, flanked by massive round towers at each corner, capped with ogival domes. Jeanne, only heiress of Galiot de Genouillac, married Charles de Crussol, vicomte d'Uz√®s (1483‚Äì1546). In 1768, their descendant, the duc d'Uz√®s, sold most of the ch√¢teau to demolition contractors, who pulled down the buildings and sold the materials. The duke retained the west wing for agricultural uses. In spite of the classification of the building as a historic monument, by Prosper M√©rim√©e in 1841, the agricultural use continued until the whole of the surviving building was acquired by the French state in 1934. Since 1901, when it was registered as a monument historique, extensive restoration works have been carried out. The building is now in the care of the Centre des monuments nationaux, and is open to the public. Ch√¢teau d'Assier as built Architecture The remaining west wing retains its pedimented gateway, which sheltered, in a niche at first floor level, an equestrian statue of Galiot de Genouillac. The courtyard frontage is decorated with two broad friezes, richly carved with emblems referring to the military achievements of Galiot de Genouillac, and to the legend of Hercules. Inside, a grand staircase, vaulted on intersecting ribs, leads up to a marble pillar, decorated with \\"grotesques\\", which is thought to be the work of Jean Goujon or one of his pupils. The interior comprises a series of vaulted rooms, decorated with martial trophies, and containing a small museum. The external and interior decoration is typical of the French Renaissance style, with Classical orders (ionic, doric, Corinthian), scenes from the legend of Hercules, such as the Lernaean Hydra and the Nemean lion, as well as more personal motifs, such as the cannons, swords, the collar of the Order of Saint Michael. A tower-shaped dovecote, dating to 1537, contains 2,500 terracotta nesting boxes, which were accessed by a rotating ladder. Now private property, the dovecote was registered as a monument historique on 21 November 2005. The mill was built on the site of a medieval mill, and was rebuilt several times.

Hunt. The film is based upon the 1985 novel of the same name written by Danielle Steel. The drama centers on a television producer and his relationship with the star of his latest TV series.The New York Times  Plot  The film focuses on the cast and crew of a new TV series called Manhattan, which is shot on location in New York City. Mel Wexler is a successful producer who has become a workaholic since the death of his family in a plane crash. Trying to forget his loss, he throws himself on producing Manhattan. For the lead role, he tries to cast the feared film star Sabina Quarles, who has a reputation of being hard to work with. She initially declines, explaining she is too good for television. However, because of her past with Mel, she finally accepts the role. They soon start a relationship, but he remains suspicious of her constant visits to San Francisco. She is reluctant to explain why she is going there every month, which makes him think she has an affair. Meanwhile, playing her stepson in the series is Bill Warwick, an actor who is a sex symbol. He is married to Sandy, but because of his image, he has to keep their marriage a secret. Sandy was once a great actress, but her drug addiction has turned her into a street prostitute, ignoring her work. He thinks a co-starring role could help her going towards the right path, but she fails to show up at her audition. The role eventually goes to Gaby Smith, a rich actress who graduated from Yale. From the very beginning, Bill is upset that his wife wasn't given the role and as a result, treats Gaby very badly. This makes her very sad, constantly trying to win his trust over. The only colleague supporting her is Jane Adams. Jane at first hesitated to take the role, because it required her to move from Los Angeles to New York City. Her husband Dan doesn't approve of her acting career and she is therefore a victim of domestic violence. Her teenage daughter Alexa thinks Jane is the cause of the family falling apart and doesn't want to have anything to do with her. While shooting the series, Jane starts a relationship with co-star Zack Taylor, who also bears a dark secret. Three years ago, he spent the night with a girl. It later appeared her mother taped their night and that she was a minor. Since then, she is blackmailing him for money. Jane feels bad for him and decides to get the video tape by posing as a cop and threatening to sue the girl's mother. It eventually turns out to be that the girl was already 18 years old. One night, Sandy is in trouble with a drug dealer and calls to Bill for help. He realizes she will never be the same and decides to file for divorce. However, the same night she is murdered and Bill becomes the prime suspect. Gaby tries to help him by delivering him a false alibi, but that only makes him look more suspicious. Although she delivered him even more trouble, he apologizes to her for being mean to her and they eventually start dating. Meanwhile, the crew of Manhattan decide to shoot a death scene of Bill's character, in case he is found guilty. However, his innocence is eventually proven and he remains on the series. Meanwhile, Jane is at one point held hostage by her ex-husband, because he found out about her relationship with Zack. Alexa, who was currently staying at Jane's, walks in on them and she realizes that actually her father was the bad guy. At the end, Sabina admits to Mel that she was once impregnated by a politician and gave birth out of wedlock. The son turned out to be a very sick boy and he required the best doctors, who were only available in San Francisco. When Mel finds out, he proposes to Sabina and invites her to live with them.

She was formerly the French Atalante, captured in 1797. She served with the British during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, and was wrecked in 1807. French service and capture Atalante was a brig built at Bayonne between 1793 and 1794 to a design by Raymond-Antoine Haran. She was launched in January 1794 as the only ship built to her design. Between 28 January 1794 and 9 October, Atalante was under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Soustra. She sailed from Bayonne to Brest, before cruising in the vicinity of the Azores and then returning to Brest.Fonds Marine, p.86. Atalante participated in the Croisi√®re du Grand Hiver, an unsuccessful sortie by the French fleet at Brest on 24 December 1794. She then returned to Bayonne, and later Brest.Fonds Marine, p.120. By 13 October 1795, she was at Concarneau and under the command of enseigne de vaisseau Dordelin.Fonds Marine, p.145. captured Atalante on 10 January 1797 off the Scilly Isles. At capture she was under the command of now lieutenant de vaisseaux Dordelin,Fonds Marine, p.194. and had a crew of 112 men. Her captors reported that she was a three-year-old brig with a coppered hull and an 80-foot keel. The British took her back to Portsmouth. She was registered there before being sent on to Plymouth, where the Navy had her fitted out between June and September 1798. French Revolutionary Wars Atalante was commissioned under Commander Digby Dent in July 1798, but was paid off in October that year. Recommissioned in December, this time under Commander Anselm Griffiths, she went on to have a particularly successful career against French privateers. On 20 February 1799, she and captured the French privateer cutter Milan. Milan was armed with 14 guns and had a crew of 44 men. Atalante took the prize into port. On 4 December, Atalante captured the privateer lugger Succ√®s (or Success). Atalante came upon a lugger in the act of capturing a brig, and immediately set off in pursuit. The privateer abandoned her prize and tried to escape. About three hours later, Atalante dropped off her master in her jolly boat to recapture the brig, and continued the pursuit without stopping. After a pursuit of about 11 hours, Atalante finally caught up with and captured the privateer. Succ√®s was armed with six guns and had a crew of 48 men under the command of Francois Matthieu Blondin. She was six days out of Boulogne and the interrupted capture was her first prize. The master, Edward Lewington, and crew of the prize were aboard Succ√®s and they reported that they had been sailing from London to Belfast when the privateer had captured them the night before west of Dungeness. On 29 January 1801, Atalante captured and destroyed the Spanish privateer Intrepido Cid. and shared, by agreement, in the bounty-money. On 26 February 1801, she sent into Plymouth the Bon Aventura, which had been sailing from St Ullus to Limerick when the French privateer Grande Decide, of 18 guns, had captured her. Atalante had recaptured Bon Avenura.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 5, p.272. On 1 April 1801, Atalante was in company with Viper when they encountered four French privateers off Land's End. Three of the privateers escaped. Nevertheless, Atalante pursued one and after a chase of 17 hours captured her. She turned out to be the brig H√©ros, of Saint Malo. She was armed with 14 guns and had a crew of 73 men under the command of her master, Renne Crosse. On 10 August 1801, Atalantes cutter, manned by eight men, captured the 58-ton lugger Eveill√© in Quiberon Bay. The lugger was armed with two 4-pounder guns and four 1¬Ω-pounder swivel guns. As the cutter approached, the lugger fired on the cutter, as did some small shore batteries. The lugger was within small-arms range of the shore and as the crew of the cutter boarded the lugger, the lugger's crew abandoned her. The British suffered no casualties. Captain A.J. Griffiths made no mention of signs of French casualties and described the lugger as being in the \\"Service of the Republic\\". At about the same time, Atalante also captured three light boats. On 24 August 1801, a prize to Atalante, a French dogger with a cargo of wines and brandies, came into Plymouth.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 6, p.252. Griffiths was succeeded in May 1802 by Commander Joseph Masefield, who operated out of Portland. On 13 June 1802, Masefield sailed Atalante on an anti-smuggling patrol.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 7, p.530. On 1 October 1802, he sent in to Portsmouth a large smuggling vessel with 360 casks of spirits and 20 bales of tobacco. Then the next week, he sent in a lugger with 170 ankers of spirits, a sloop with 120, and a large boat with 400.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 8, pp.349-50. On 14 October 1802, he brought into Plymouth the 80-ton Admiral Pole, of Exeter, which Atalante caught after a long chase.Russell (1887), p.109. She too had been carrying 170 ankers of spirits. Admiral Pole had been captured some months earlier at Weymouth and then released after posting bond with the Board of Customs and Excise.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 8, p.347. Napoleonic Wars When Masefield (or Mansfield) recommissioned Atalante on 10 January 1803, two days after paying her off, he apparently did not want for crew. His success on anti-smuggling patrol had apparently resulted in his previous crew earning prize money the equivalent of their pay for the six-month period. Masefield had captured eight smuggling vessels and seized 1,000 ankers of spirits, in addition to bale goods.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 9, pp.76-7. On 14 March 1803, Atalante sailed from Plymouth to retrieve the sloop from Mount's Bay, where she had taken refuge, having been dismasted in a gale. Atalante returned the next day with Galgo.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 9, p.244. That same day Atalante and Nemesis sailed under sealed orders to Cawsand Bay where they received further orders that sent them to Bristol to impress seamen.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 9, pp.247-8. On 13 May 1803, and Atalante returned to Plymouth from a cruise that had them monitoring French naval movements off Brest.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 9, p.417. On 16 June 1803, a French brig, prize to Atalante came into Plymouth.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 10, p.82. On 7 June 1803, Atlante captured the merchant ship Ocean. Then one month later, on 8 July 1803, Atalante captured the French ship Prudent. Then on 24 September 1803, Atalante captured four French merchant vessels. These were the Jeune Adelphie, Marie Elizabeth, Betz√©e, and Fortun√©e. On 9 October 1803, Atalante pursued two ketches and a brig at Saint Gildas Point. The quarry ran ashore near the mouth of the Pennerf river. Mansfield then sent in his boats on a cutting out expedition. One boat captured one of the ketches but couldn't bring her off; while they were so engaged they endured fire from soldiers on board the other ketch and troops with two field guns on the beach. The boarding party then abandoned their vessel and went to the assistance of the party that had boarded the brig. That party had killed six of the 10 or 12 soldiers on the brig, thrown two over board, and driven the rest and the crew below decks. The boarding party was unable to get the brig off the shore so they abandoned her without setting her on fire in consideration of the men below decks. Atalante lost one man killed and two wounded in the operation. The next day, Masefield was pleased to see that the brig was on a ridge of rocks and \\"apparently bilged\\". That same day, i.e., 9 October, there came into Plymouth a large lugger with brandy, wine, and Castile soup that Atalantes boats had cut out near Brest. The three timber vessels they cut out at the same time turn out more valuable than had initially been expected because their cargo turned out to be timber of different scantlings for first and second rates. The timber vessels had been sailing to 1'Orient, where several ships were building.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 10, p.347. On 24 March 1804, Atalante captured the French chasse maree Volante. Volante from Nantes, arrived at Plymouth in early April.Lloyd's List, no.4441, - accessed 20 June 2014. In July 1805, Atalante captured the Belissaire and the Napoleon, carrying brandy and rosin, and sent them into Plymouth.Lloyd's List, no.4237, - accessed 20 June 2014. On 20 May 1806, Atalante captured the Fortuna Waggona. Atalante was also in sight when captured the French ketch Amis de Juste. That same month Atalante captured the Noord Termans, Wagener, master, as she was sailing from St. Martin's to Bremen. Atalante sent her into Plymouth.Lloyd's List, no.4057, - accessed 20 June 2014. Atalante was assigned to the squadron under Sir Samuel Hood on 25 September 1806. On 19 October 1806, , and Atalante captured the chasse marees Achille, Jenny and Marianne. In 1807, Lieutenant John Bowker took over command in an acting capacity. When he took command, Bowker requested that Atalante be surveyed. He noted that when the wind blew fresh, water would enter at a rate of 20 inches per hour. He was refused. Later, Sir Samuel Hood testified in Parliament that Commander Keats had assured him that Atalante was seaworthy. Bowker's time in command was short-lived. Fate On 12 February 1807, Atalante was wrecked off the √éle de R√©, near Rochefort. She had been cruising to watch enemy vessels in Rochefort when she hit the Grande Blanche rock at 10 pm. Despite attempts to lighten her that included cutting away her masts, she continued to founder. At daybreak, three British vessels approached and took off the crew, enduring fire from shore batteries as they did so. The first was the cutter , followed later by the frigates and . During the night, some of the crewmen took two of Atalantes boats without permission. The cutter, with 22 men, reached shore, where the French took them prisoner. The jolly boat, with the gunner and six men, headed out to sea where a ship from the British blockading squadron picked them up. The gunner, John Brockman, had been officer of the watch when Atalante had struck. He had ignored Lieutenant Bowker's order not to take her into shallow water and had ignored the advice of the French pilot, M. Legall, who was on board in an advisory capacity. That Brockman had left without permission during the night further undermined his case at the court martial for the loss of the ship. The board ordered Brockman disrated.

Passenger rail transport in Panama dates back to the 1850s, when the first transisthmian railroad line across Panama was beginning to be built to supply an alternate route to California in search of gold and wealth. The Panama Railroad was operating between Col√≥n and Panama City by 1855. An attempt to build a battery operated tram network in Col√≥n in 1910 was not successful.  Panama City  On 16 May 1889, the Ministry of Public Works in Bogot√° let a contract with a Colombian company to build what would have been the first street railway in Panama City. That first company failed to complete the tramway line. The contract was then bought out by foreign investors, who formed the United Electric Tramways Company in London on 22 October 1892. On 1 October 1893, the service was inaugurated on a Panama City line that was built with English financing and Siemens electrical technology along Avenida Central. It was not the very first, but was among the first few electric tramway systems built in Latin America. The United Electric Tramway line started service just as the first major attempt to build a canal across the isthmus by the Ferdinand de Lesseps- led Soci√©t√© internationale du Canal interoc√©anique was winding down. By 1894, a second effort to build a canal under a newly formed Compagnie Nouvelle du Canal de Panama was started. The construction efforts helped boost ridership along the new tramway line. The second canal construction attempt did not succeed, and the economy of the isthmus slowed. Service along that first Panama City tramway line ended during the Thousand Days' War, which lasted from 1899 to 1902. On 3 November 1903 the Republic of Panama declared its separation from Colombia, having previously been the Isthmus Department of Colombia. In 1904 the United States took over operations of the Compagnie Nouvelle du Canal de Panama and expanded the effort, eventually completing the Panama Canal. While canal construction was underway, on 29 October 1906 the new Panamanian government let a contract for a new tramway in Panama City. The initial attempt to build the new line failed and the contract was put up for bid once more. The contract was taken up by a person working for the United Fruit Company, who formed a new Panama Tramways Company on 9 November 1911. The Panama Tramways Company was incorporated in New Jersey, and began building a new tramway line in 1912. The new narrow gauge line opened for service on 1 August 1913, one year before the opening of the Panama Canal. In 1914 the Panama Tramways Company was reorganized as the Panama Electric Company and the latter company was acquired by the Electric Bond and Share Company (Ebasco) on 27 September 1917. At the time, Ebasco was a holding company subsidiary of General Electric. In 1916 an author noted that Panama City: Nevertheless, the new tramway was subject to a strike amidst a general strike of other workers such as garbage collectors in October 1916. Both the original United Electric Tramways Company, and the later Panama Tramways Company used equipment with entrance doors on the left since the isthmus was a drive on the left traffic area in the 19th century. Panama changed to drive on the right for road vehicles in 1943. A level junction intersection of the two track tram line with the two track Panama Rail Road line was constructed along Avenida Central in 1920 to avoid the need for the trams to follow a longer route around the mainline railroad that had previously gone along Avenida Norte and Calle 23 Este. At the outer end of the line in Sabanas, near Calle 62, there was a bullring with a wooden grandstand. Tramway service on the Panama City line lasted until midnight on Saturday 31 May 1941. The contract between the company and the government had been nullified and transport service was subsequently provided by buses.  Col√≥n  The city of Col√≥n had a horsecar tramway initially. There was then an attempt to build a battery operated, electric street railway in Col√≥n starting in 1910, however it was reported around July 1914 in foreign press reports that work on the Col√≥n project was suspended. The Col√≥n battery tramway was never completed. 21st century In 2000 a study was carried out by transit officials in Panama City and a French consulting firm on the feasibility of building a new two-line light rail transit system in the city. But in 2010, the government of Panama announced it planned to proceed with the construction of the new Panama Metro in Panama City instead. Unlike a tramway or a light rail line, a metro uses fully grade separated tracks as opposed to the street running of a tramway. The Panama Metro opened for operation in April 2014.

The Cavern Club opened on 16 January 1957 as a jazz club, later becoming a centre of the rock and roll scene in Liverpool in the early 1960s. The club became closely associated with the Merseybeat music genre and, famously, regularly played host to The Beatles in their early years.. The Cavern Club closed and opened in a new site in March 1973 and was filled in during construction work on the Merseyrail underground rail loop. It would later be excavated and reopened on 26 April 1984. History=Early history= Alan Sytner opened The Cavern Club, having been inspired by the jazz district in Paris, where there were a number of clubs in cellars. Sytner returned to Liverpool and strove to open a club similar to the Le Caveau de la Huchette jazz club in Paris. He eventually found a fruit warehouse where people were leasing the cellar; before this, it was used as an air raid shelter in World War II. The club was opened on 16 January 1957. The first act to perform at the opening of the club was the Merseysippi Jazz Band. Local commercial artist Tony Booth created the poster artwork for the opening night, who shortly after became the original poster artist for The Beatles. What started as a jazz club eventually became a hangout for skiffle groups. Whilst playing golf with Sytner's father, Dr. Joseph Sytner, Nigel Walley‚Äîwho had left school at 15 to become an apprentice golf professional at the Lee Park Golf Club‚Äîasked Dr. Sytner if his son could book The Quarrymen at The Cavern, which was one of three jazz clubs he managed. Dr. Sytner suggested that the band should play at the golf club first, so as to assess their talent.. After performing at the golf club, Sytner phoned Walley a week later and offered the band an interlude spot playing skiffle between the performances of two jazz bands at The Cavern, on Wednesday, 7 August 1957.. Before the performance, the Quarrymen argued amongst themselves about the set list, as rock 'n roll songs were definitely not allowed at the club, but skiffle was tolerated. After opening with a skiffle song, John Lennon called for the others to start playing an Elvis Presley song, \\"Don't Be Cruel\\". Rod Davis warned Lennon that the audience would \\"eat you alive\\", but Lennon ignored this and started playing the song himself, forcing the others to join in. Halfway through, Sytner pushed his way through the audience and handed Lennon a note which read, \\"Cut out the bloody rock 'n roll\\".. Paul McCartney's first appearance at The Cavern was with The Quarrymen on 24 January 1958.. (George Harrison first played at The Cavern during a lunchtime session on 9 February 1961.) Sytner sold The Cavern Club to Ray McFall in 1959 and moved to London. Blues bands and Beat groups began to appear at the club on a regular basis in the early 1960s. The first Beat night was held on 25 May 1960 and featured a performance by Rory Storm and the Hurricanes (which included Ringo Starr as drummer). By early 1961, Bob Wooler had become the full-time comp√®re and organiser of the lunchtime sessions. The club hosted its first performance by the Beatles on Thursday 9 February 1961. Brian Epstein, The Beatles manager who secured the groups' first recording contract, first saw the group perform at the club on 9 November 1961. Inspired by the group, Epstein made moves to take over their management.. =The Beatles and others= The sculpture of John Lennon outside The Cavern pub, opposite the Cavern Club was unveiled on 16 January 1997. The Beatles made their first appearance at the club on 9 February 1961 after returning to Liverpool from Hamburg, Germany where they had been playing at the Indra and the Kaiserkeller clubs. Their stage show had been through a lot of changes, with some in the audience thinking they were watching a German band, as they were billed from Hamburg. From 1961 to 1963 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, with their last occurring on 3 August 1963, a month after the band recorded \\"She Loves You\\" and just six months before the Beatles' first trip to the U.S. By this time \\"Beatlemania\\" was sprouting across England, and with girls demanding to see the Beatles and screaming just to get a glimpse of them, the group had to hide or sneak into concerts, and the small club could no longer satisfy audience demand. After the Beatles' farewell gig on 3 August 1963, Bob Wooler gave their future dates to The Mastersounds, a local R & B band, led by Mal Jefferson. The Beatles had graduated from the club and had been signed to EMI's Parlophone label by producer George Martin. The amount of musical activity in Liverpool and Manchester caused record producers who had previously never ventured very far from London to start looking to the north. In 1963, young local band The Hideaways were signed up to the newly founded Cavern Club agency and became the resident group, often stepping in for last minute artist cancellations; they also became the first pop group to appear on a nationwide television commercial for Timex Watch Company filmed by the Rank Organisation at the Cavern Club. The band also performed at the Cavern the night prior to the club's closure, making them the last group to perform on stage along with disc jockey Billy Butler and doorman Paddy Delaney, who‚Äîwith fans‚Äîbarricaded themselves into the club prior to the authorities' arrival the next morning to gain access. The Hideaways were also proactive along with local MP Bessie Braddock to reopen the Cavern; as a result they were the first group back on stage when the club re-opened on 23 July 1966 with local MP Bessie Braddock and then-Prime Minister Harold Wilson. The Hideaways also hold the official record of over 400 Cavern Club appearances at both old and new venues and are now recognised and named on the wall of fame. In the decade that followed, a wide variety of popular acts appeared at the club, including The Rolling Stones, The Yardbirds, The Hollies, The Kinks, Elton John, Black Sabbath, Queen, The Who and John Lee Hooker. Petula Clark references the club twice as \\"a cellar full of noise\\" in her 1965 hit record \\"I Know a Place\\". Brian Epstein's 1964 autobiography was entitled \\"A Cellarful of Noise\\". Future star Cilla Black worked as the hat-check girl there. The club closed in March 1973 after British Rail compulsory purchased the warehouses, of which the basement housed the Cavern Club, in order to build a ventilation shaft for the new underground railway (Merseyrail). This was never built, and the area was turned into a car park. =Today= External view of the reopened Cavern Club, October 2012 Soon after the Cavern club closed in 1973, a new Cavern club re- opened at 7 Mathew Street, later renamed the Revolution Club. This club would later shut down and be reopened as Erics, which itself became a notable local music venue in the late 1970s. On 7 December 1981 plans were revealed to excavate the buried remains of the Cavern Club cellar. It would form part of a ¬£7-million redevelopment project of the former warehouse site of 8-12 Mathew Street which had housed the Cavern Club up until its closure in 1973. However, on 23 June 1982 it was announced by the project architect David Backhouse, that the plans to excavate and re-open the Cavern Club in its original form would be impossible for structural reasons. Tests had revealed that the arches of the old cellar had been too badly damaged during the demolition of the ground floor of the Cavern Club and the warehouses above. 5,000 bricks from the damaged archways of the original cellar area of the Cavern Club went on sale at ¬£5 each, complete with an authentication plate signed by former Cavern Club owner Ray McFall. Proceeds from the sale of the 5,000 bricks went to Strawberry Field Children's home. Prior to the Cavern Club's opening ceremony, over 100 musicians from the 1960s Mersey Beat era were invited to sign the wall at the back of the Cavern's stage, a tradition which began in the early days of the Jazz bands in the 1950s and continued through the '60s and '70s. A further 15,000 bricks from the Cavern site were used on the authentic reconstruction of the Cavern Club within the redevelopment. The Cavern Club now sits at a 90 degree angle to the original and covers 70% of the original Cavern footprint, the stage is not far from the original location, and the 'Live Lounge' is an exact replica of the original, using as many of the old bricks as possible. The fire exit, next to the Cilla Black statue, is the location of the original entrance. The club was taken over by former Liverpool F.C. player Tommy Smith. The new design was to resemble the original as closely as possible. This coincided with a period of massive economic and political change in and around Liverpool and the club survived only until 1989, when it came under financial pressures and closed for 18 months. In 1991, two friends‚Äîschoolteacher Bill Heckle and taxi driver Dave Jones‚Äîreopened it, along with George Guinness. They still run the club today and are now the longest-running owners in its history. The club continues to function primarily as a live music venue. The music policy varies from the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s classic pop music to indie, rock and modern chart music. On 14 December 1999, former Beatle Paul McCartney played the New Cavern Club, publicising his new album, Run Devil Run. It has about 40 live bands performing every week; both tribute and original bands, although most perform their own material. The back room of the Cavern is the most frequently used location for touring acts and ticketed events, in more recent times playing host to The Wanted, Adele and Jessie J. The Cavern is also used as a tour warm-up venue with semi-secret gigs announced at the last moment. The Arctic Monkeys did this in October 2005, Jake Bugg in November 2013, as well as Travis and Oasis. The front room is the main tourist attraction, where people come to have their photograph taken on the stage, with the names of the bands who played there written on the back wall. This room hosts live music from noon to midnight Monday to Thursday, and noon to close on Fridays and weekend. Between November 2005 and September 2007, the front room played host to the Cavern Showcase,. an organisation and event started by 1960s star Kingsize Taylor, his wife Marga, and best friend Wes Paul. The night took place every Sunday and featured original 1960s bands such as The Mojos and The Undertakers. In November 2008, a campaign to have Gary Glitter's brick removed from the wall of fame was successful. A brass plaque near where it was located notes that the bricks of two former Cavern Club performers - Glitter and Jonathan King - have been removed.. In 2017, the Cavern commissioned Tony Booth, the artist who designed all the original posters and signage for the original club, to produce 60th anniversary artwork which portrays bands and musicians who performed there. Also in 2017, a statue of Cilla Black commissioned by her sons was unveiled outside the Cavern's original entrance. In June 2018, Paul McCartney came back to the Cavern Club. During a Facebook Live Q&A; session in the Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts, Paul McCartney hinted that he would perform a secret gig the following day. At 9 a.m. on 26 June it was announced via his Facebook page and The Cavern Club's Facebook page that Paul would be returning to the club. Tickets were sold from The Echo Arena box office, leaving people who had camped overnight on Mathew Street disappointed. Paul McCartney was expected to play only a 45-minute set, but performed for two hours. He opened the show saying \\"Liverpool! Cavern! These are words that go together well!\\" and then played a mixed set featuring songs from his upcoming album, Egypt Station. Tributes The Cavern Wall of Fame, surrounding the club Tribute clubs exist in Dallas, Buenos Aires, Wellington, Exeter, Costa Teguise in Lanzarote, and formerly in Tokyo and Adelaide. A similar looking club was also featured in the opening sequence of the film Across the Universe, in homage to The Beatles' beginnings, though the club's name was never mentioned. The footage for this scene was actually shot in The Cavern Club itself. The Cavern Club is the first playable location in The Beatles: Rock Band. The Hard Rock Cafe restaurant and hotel chain owns the trademark to the \\"Cavern Club\\" name in the US. When the Hard Rock Cafe was built in Boston in 1991, it included a brick Cavern Club cellar that was a reproduction of the Liverpool club, including a stage for local bands. In 2006, the Boston restaurant moved to a new location, and although the new restaurant still has a \\"Cavern Club\\" performing area, it bears no resemblance to the Liverpool cellar. In 2014, a lawsuit was filed to revoke Hard Rock's trademark on the Cavern Club name. It also had a cameo in two John Lennon biopics, 2000's In His Life: The John Lennon Story and 2009's Nowhere Boy, as well as the movie Across the Universe. The poet Roger McGough mentioned the club in his poem \\"Let Me Die A Youngman's Death\\": \\"Or when I'm 104 / and banned from the Cavern / may my mistress / catching me in bed with her daughter / and fearing for her son / cut me up into little pieces and throw away every piece but one.\\" Norwegian Cruise Lines have Cavern Clubs on two of their liners, the Norwegian Bliss and the Norwegian Epic, which showcase Beatles tribute bands.The Cavern teams up with Norwegian Cruise Lines for a 2nd time, June 1, 2018, https://www.cavernclub.org/latest-news/the-cavern- teams-up-with-norwegian-cruise-lines-for-a-2nd-time See also * Cavern Mecca, a museum that was next to the Cavern Club * Iron Door Club References ;Bibliography * Further reading * Spencer Leigh, The Cavern: The Most Famous Club in the World, The Story of the Cavern Club, SAF Publishing, 2008, 224 pp. * Phil Thompson, The Best of Cellars : The Story of the World famous Cavern Club, The Bluecoat Press, 1994, 208 pp. .

The team last played out of Viola Arena in Cardiff Bay. The Devils recently missed out on the league title on the final day of the 2018-19 season after losing 3‚Äì1 to Coventry Blaze, allowing the Belfast Giants to win the league. Cardiff are the reigning EIHL playoff champions, winning their second title in a row after beating the Belfast Giants 2‚Äì1 at the 2019 EIHL Playoff Final. History  Founded in 1986, the club became the dominant force in the sport in the late 1980s and early 1990s, winning a total of 7 league titles. The Cardiff Devils were formed during the summer of 1986 when Sports Nationwide built the Wales National Ice Rink in the centre of Cardiff. John Lawless, a 25-year-old Canadian, was given the responsibility of setting up a brand new team, having been a trainee assistant manager at Peterborough who were owned by the same company. =1986‚Äì87= The club entered the British Ice Hockey League Structure at the bottom in Division 2 (Midland Section) at a time when each team was only allowed a maximum of three import players. With Lawless deciding to play himself, he brought over fellow Canadians Perry Olivier and Bill Taylor to join him on the roster, with the remaining places going to British players, one of whom, Paul Morganti, a student at Cardiff University, had been raised in Canada and had significant high school hockey experience. With the WNIR not ready for the start of the season, the team played several games away from home to begin with. The Cardiff Devils' first ever game was a Challenge match away to the Oxford City Stars on 12 October 1986. Despite Oxford playing in the division above, the Devils won the game 9‚Äì8. Cardiff finally got to play their first ever game at the WNIR on 30 November 1986 where a crowd of 2500 saw their new heroes humiliate Ashfield Islanders 32‚Äì0. Devils finished the league season unbeaten with 13 wins and 1 draw from 14 games to finish top of Division 2 (Midlands), 2 points clear of Welsh rivals Deeside Dragons. Promotion to Division 1 though was dependent on them winning the Division 1 Play-off Champions, which the club hosted at the WNIR. Their semi-final against Northern winners Grimsby Buffaloes was surrounded in controversy when the game was abandoned after a 34-player bench clearance with Cardiff leading 10‚Äì4. The BIHA officials though ruled that it had been provoked by the English side and hence the score should stand as a final result. In the other semi-final Scottish League Champions Aviemore Blackhawks beat Southern Winners Streatham Bruins(13‚Äì4) to set up an all Celtic final the following day. Unfortunately for the Devils, despite a final period comeback after being 4 goals behind, Aviemore were able to hang on for a 10‚Äì9 win and promotion to Division 1 at the expense of Cardiff. But in a strange twist of fate the result proved to be irrelevant. The BIHA decided the league structure needed re-organising, and as a result the Cardiff Devils were moved into Division 1 (South) for the following season. =1987‚Äì88= Following promotion to Division 1 (South) and a new Sponsorship deal, Lawless was able to strengthen his team. Key signings included netminder Jeff Smith, coach Brian Kanewischer and Canadian defenceman Shannon Hope as a replacement for Bill Taylor who was injured midway through the previous season. The season proved to be successful with the Devils winning the Autumn Trophy in November with an 11‚Äì10 aggregate win over the Trafford Metros. In the league the side finished a very respectable 3rd place, although 10 points behind winners Telford Tigers. The two teams had created a fierce rivalry during the season due to several controversial and violent games. During a game on 16 January in Telford, the Devils players were subjected to constant sticking offences resulted in Shannon Hope receiving a serious injury just below his eye. With the referee not calling any penalty, coach Kanewischer took his team off the ice in protest midway through the 2nd period. After a league investigation Cardiff were eventually fined ¬£1000 for their actions and Kanewisher banned for the rest of the season. =1988‚Äì89= Lawless and Cardiff shocked the whole of British Ice Hockey by signing 3 of the top players from the Premier Division over the summer. Canadian import Steve Moria was signed from the Fife Flyers, and then the Cooper brothers Ian and Steve joined from Heineken Champions Durham Wasps. It was the first time top British players were being offered good money to sign for other clubs and it led to claims that Cardiff and their \\"Cheque Book Hockey\\" would ruin the game. The signings were crucial as the Devils finished first 1st in Division 1, just a single point ahead of Medway Bears. They also retained the Autumn Trophy they had won the previous season, beating Medway 15‚Äì8 on aggregate. To gain promotion though they had to beat the Premier Division's bottom club ‚Äì the Streatham Redskins. Cardiff destroyed their Premier Division rivals 12‚Äì1 in the first leg, and a 9‚Äì5 victory in Streatham the following weekend secured an easy aggregate victory and a place in the Heineken Premier Division for the following season. =1989‚Äì90= With the Devils finally reaching the promised land of the Premier Division, John Lawless was able to strengthen his team with the addition of an extra import now that he himself had received his British Passport. Paul Castron was signed but pulled out just before the start of the season, but fortunately for the club Doug McEwen had been released by Peterborough at the same time and so signed for the Devils instead. Victory in the pre-season Trafford Tournament gave an indication of the success to come, although the Devils did get knocked out of the Autumn Cup at the semi-final stage to Durham Wasps. In the league though they were unbeaten until December, by which time they had built up a healthy lead at the top of the table. A 14‚Äì7 victory at home to the Peterborough Pirate on 4 March 1990 clinched their first ever Premier Division League title. Unbeaten in the Playoffs Qualifying group, the Devils travelled to Wembley where they beat Fife Flyers 5‚Äì1 in the semi-final. In the final they faced the Murrayfield Racers who quickly went 3‚Äì0 up. Cardiff fought back though and a Steven Cooper goal 95 seconds from the end tied the game at 6‚Äì6 and sent the game into Overtime and then a Penalty Shootout. After Doug McEwen had scored the 23rd shot, Jeff Smith saved Tony Hand's attempt and the Devils had won the Playoff Championship in one of the greatest Finals of all time, live on BBC Grandstand. =1990‚Äì91= After the previous years success, the British players were in great demand. Ian and Stephen Cooper both returned to Durham, whilst Brian Dickson and Robbie Morris also left. In came Derek King (Fife Flyers), Neil Browne (Slough Jets), Paul Heavey and Peter Smith (both Peterborough Pirates). Despite a record breaking Europa Cup tournament which included an 11‚Äì8 victory over Rodovre and a 3rd placed group finish, the team struggled for consistency domestically. Knocked out once again at the semi-final stage of the Autumn Cup by Durham Wasps, they finished second to the Wasps in the league and were knocked out in the Playoff Semi-finals by Peterborough Pirates as Durham completed the Grand Slam. =1997 ‚Äì 07/08= In 1997 the club won the Superleague championship. Hardship followed and the club was declared bankrupt in 2001 but a new team was soon formed which competed in the British National League. The new owners massively reduced spending and effectively disbanded the old Cardiff Devils, with the entire Superleague team departing. The then-owner, Bob Phillips was the subject of much scorn amongst fans due to the perceived mismanagement and effective destruction of what was then one of Britain's most established and stable teams. The new team was formed from a handful of quickly drafted players, as well scavenging the Cardiff Devils youth teams to make up the numbers under the lower budget. Attendances at games dropped heavily, going from full arenas to typically less than fifty. During the first two seasons under Phillips, large protests and demonstrations were commonplace outside games, with initially hundreds of supporters club members appearing outside the arena. While eventually the supporters club would reconcile with Bob Phillips and some of the old players would make goodwill appearances, the team's best years were clearly behind them. In 2003, the Devils became founder members of the Elite League, finishing the first season in 5th place. They were semi-finalists in the end of season playoffs, losing to champions Sheffield Steelers. During the 2004‚Äì05 NHL lock-out, Rob Davison of the San Jose Sharks played for the Devils. The 2004‚Äì5 season did not finish well for the Devils. As in the 03‚Äì04 season, they reached the playoff semi-finals, but were once again defeated, this time by the Nottingham Panthers. During 2005, serious questions over the future of the Devils began to emerge. The Wales National Ice Rink was due for demolition in 2006 to make way for a John Lewis store and plans for a new ice arena at Sophia Gardens were progressing at an extremely slow pace. There was a very real threat that 2005‚Äì06 could have been the last season of the Cardiff Devils. The Save Our Rink Action Committee (SORAC) formed to lead calls from the city's ice hockey clubs and fans for a temporary facility to be constructed while a more permanent building was finally built. SORAC successfully campaigned for a temporary rink in the Cardiff Bay area of the city. Planning permission was given in January 2006 and the structure was expected to be completed in time for the 2006‚Äì07 ice hockey season. However this proved not to be the case, with construction problems delaying the opening of the Cardiff Arena until December 2006. The Devils won their first silverware of the EIHL era in 2006. The Devils faced arch rivals Coventry Blaze in a repeat of the previous year's Challenge Cup final but were beaten 3‚Äì0 in the first leg of the final in Coventry. The Devils however managed an incredible turn around in the second leg, defeating the Blaze 4‚Äì1 to tie the game on aggregate and won the cup 1‚Äì0 in the following penalty shoot-out. \\"Man of the Match\\" Nathan Rempel scored a memorable hat-trick, whilst Rejean Stringer scored the winning goal in the penalty shoot-out. In January 2007 player-coach Ed Patterson was released by the Devils in a cost-cutting move. Patterson was replaced as player / coach by Gerad Adams, with Brad Voth taking over from Adams as captain. After several games during which injured players carried out the duties of bench coach, former Devils player Brent Pope was appointed to the position. Despite off-ice difficulties throughout the 2006‚Äì07 season, the Devils finished 3rd in the league. The Devils also won the British Knockout Cup, beating rivals Coventry Blaze 3‚Äì0 at Coventry's Skydome. A cup double was snatched from the Cardiff Devils' grasp when they lost 1‚Äì0 on penalties to the Nottingham Panthers in the 2006‚Äì07 Playoff Final, after the game finished 1‚Äì1 after overtime. The 2007‚Äì08 season saw the Devils finish the league in 6th place. After a string of losses at the beginning of the season, they rose to an unbeaten run of games which propelled them to the top of the Elite League. However this was soon ended as a huge injury crisis hit the club leading to many of the first team having to watch from the sidelines. The Devils managed to qualify for the playoff weekend by beating the Nottingham Panthers at the Trent FM Arena, and holding them to a 3‚Äì3 draw the following evening. The Devils were defeated at the playoff weekend by the eventual winners, the Sheffield Steelers, going down 2‚Äì1. The loss capped a disappointing season. =2008/09 Season= The Devils season was mixed. The team struggled again with injuries and suspensions ‚Äì notably the highly controversial 11-game suspension of club captain Brad Voth (which was cut to 7 on review). Two summer signings, defenceman Likit Andersson and forward Rod Hinks, were cut from the squad due to injury and performance respectively. Returning defenceman Tyson Teplitsky filled the gap left by Andersson and contributed greatly in points. Canadian Marc Fulton was drafted in to replace Hinks, however after a promising start, was sidelined by injury and did not play for the club again. Joining Fulton on the injury list were centre Lee Cowmeadow and then top scorer Mike Prpich. On 26 January 2009, the Devils announced the signing of Matt Elich, a former NHL player with the Tampa Bay Lightning. Elich, brought in to replace the injured Derek Campbell, scored 1+1 in his debut game and continued to contribute points consistently. The Devils, although eliminated from the Challenge Cup got through to the British Knockout Cup final, a trophy won during the 06‚Äì07 season, after demolishing a dwindling Basingstoke Bison squad 17‚Äì1 over two legs [8‚Äì0, 9‚Äì1]. They faced and eventually lost out to the Belfast Giants Devils captain Brad Voth was given the honour of being named captain for the South team for the 'All-Star Spectacular'. The Devils scraped through to the playoff semi-finals in Nottingham after beating the Belfast Giants with an overtime goal in the Cardiff Arena from Captain Brad Voth, ending the series 6‚Äì5. The Devils then lost to the Sheffield Steelers 5‚Äì2 in the Playoff semi- finals. Sheffield went on to win the playoffs, defeating the Nottingham Panthers by 2‚Äì0 in the final, completing their league and playoff double. =2009/10 Season= The Devils started their season fairly well with big imports such as Mark Smith and Max Birbraer returning and newly signed forward Tylor Michel becoming a fan favourite quickly. The Devils buried their Challenge Cup voodoo from the new arena and progressed to the semi-finals of the Challenge Cup for the first time in 3 years by beating the Coventry Blaze 3‚Äì2 on 28 October 2009 On 7 December 2009 it was announced that forward Ryan Finnerty, formerly of the rival Sheffield Steelers had signed for Cardiff. Shortly afterward, import defenceman Scott Romfo was released, with coach Gerad Adams citing salary costs as the main reason. This move left many fans feeling disappointed, due to Scott's impressive performance over the preceding weeks. Romfo surprisingly returned to the club on 12 January 2010, following the announcement that he was being resigned to the team to provide injury cover. Cardiff Arena prior to the 2010 Challenge Cup Final first leg. On 16 February 2010, leader Brad Voth was relieved of the captaincy, after over 3 years, by head coach Gerad Adams. The reason being that Coach Adams felt Voth was being unfairly targeted by officials because of the image he had built up over the years as a hard-hitting enforcer, and that by releasing him of his duties, he could re-focus on his game. Also, if Voth had been ejected from one more game as captain, he would face a lengthy ban. Therefore, by relinquishing the armband he could carry on playing the enforcer role. British Defenceman Mark Richardson was named new team captain in his place. On 9 March 2010, the Devils lost 8‚Äì7 on aggregate in the final of the Challenge Cup to the Nottingham Panthers. The Devils in fact won the game 5‚Äì4 on the night but it was not enough to overturn the 4‚Äì2 loss suffered in the 1st leg in Cardiff the previous week. The Devils defeated the reigning Playoff champions the Sheffield Steelers in the quarter-final match up over two nights. The first leg in Cardiff saw the Devils win 4‚Äì2. The following night in Sheffield saw the Devils win again 5‚Äì3, ending the series with an aggregate score of 9‚Äì5. On 3 April, the Devils defeated the newly crowned league champions Coventry Blaze in the playoff semi-final in Nottingham by 6 goals to 3 to advance to the final. Meanwhile, on the same day, the Belfast Giants defeated the Nottingham Panthers after a penalty shootout to also advance. The final was played in Nottingham on 4 April. Belfast and Cardiff were tied 2‚Äì2 after regulation time. A scoreless OT period meant the final would go to a penalty shootout. Evan Cheverie for the Belfast Giants shot past Stevie Lyle in the second round of penalties and won the playoff title for Belfast. =2010/2011 season= The Devils embarked on the season with an average start, with critics citing an underperforming defence. With enforcer Justin Sawyer leaving the club for personal reasons in October 2010, and with iconic power forward Brad Voth out with a hand injury, things were looking bleak. On 1 November, the club announced the signing of Sawyer's replacement, ex-NHL defenceman Craig Weller. With Weller on board and Voth back in the line-up, the club embarked on a record breaking winning streak, which ended after a penalty shootout loss in Dundee on 16 January. The club did not lose a game between 28 October 2010 and 16 January 2011. On 9 January, the Devils went to the top of the Elite Ice Hockey League table with a 7‚Äì1 home win over Dundee Stars. The victory also saw first line winger Jon Pelle beat the league record for goals in a season (35), previously held by former Devils player Mike Prpich. As of 15 January 2011, the club now hold the UK record for games unbeaten in all competitions (22) and most consecutive league games unbeaten (21). The Devils management have had discussions with the IIHF and Guinness World Records who have verified that this is in fact a World Record. =Andrew Lord era, 2014‚Äì2020= Following the takeover of the club in the summer of 2014 and the arrival of Todd Kelman as General Manager, forward Andrew Lord was named player-coach of the Devils a year after he first joined the club.https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/ice-hockey/head-coach-andrew-lord- keen-7416956https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/ice-hockey/steve-king-new-man- top-7345902https://www.britishicehockey.co.uk/post/king-welcoming-the- challenge-for-cardiff/ Lord led the club to the 2015 Challenge Cup title in his first season as a coach.https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/ice-hockey/31790600 Further success followed with the club's first league title in 20 years secured at the end of the 2016-17 EIHL season, alongside another Challenge Cup title - while the team finished runners-up in the Elite League play-offs after losing the final to the Sheffield Steelers in 2017.https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/ice- hockey/39174189https://www.britishicehockey.co.uk/post/elite-league-round-up- devils-deliver-title-in-style/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/wales/39548325 In the 2017‚Äì18 EIHL season, Cardiff won both the league and play-offs double - before Lord dropped the player-coach title in 2018 and adopted the sole title as head coach.https://www.itv.com/news/utv/2018-03-16/cardiff-devils-crowned- elite-league-champions-after-win-over-giants-in- belfast/https://www.cardiffdevils.com/news/devils-are-playoff- champions/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/ice-hockey/53109501 The following season, 2018‚Äì19, the Devils missed out on the league title to Belfast Giants after a final day defeat to Coventry Blaze but made amends by winning the 2019 play-off title.https://www.itv.com/news/utv/2019-03-31/belfast-giants-to- retire-jersey-of-legend-colin-shields/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/ice- hockey/47929203 What proved to be Lord's final season as coach was brought prematurely to a halt when the 2019‚Äì20 EIHL season was curtailed in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.https://www.eliteleague.co.uk/article/731-eihl- cancels-all-matches-for-rest-of-season Cardiff were top of the table at the time of the cancellation and were runners-up in the 2020 Challenge Cup final, losing to Sheffield Steelers, although the scheduled play-offs were cancelled.https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/ice-hockey/51793748 Lord departed the Devils in June 2020 to take up the head coach role at ECHL side Greenville Swamp Rabbits.https://www.cardiffdevils.com/news/2407/https://www.swamprabbits.com/en/articles/andrew- lord-named-head-coach-of-greenville-swamp-rabbits In all, Lord won nine total titles, including two Elite League titles, two play-off championships and two Challenge Cups during his time in Cardiff, leaving as the Devils' most successful ever coach. =Life after Lord= Cardiff initially delayed the announcement of Lord's successor as head coach and, on September 15, 2020, the Elite League confirmed the suspension of the 2020‚Äì21 season due to ongoing uncertainty over coronavirus and its restrictions.

It is one of at least five locations in Vermont known as Averys Gore (or Avery's Gore), the others being located in Addison County, Chittenden County, Franklin County, and Windham County.Vermont Agency of Administration, Public Records Division. \\"Localities in Vermont\\". Retrieved February 25, 2014 This page deals specifically with the location in Essex County. In Vermont, gores and grants are unincorporated portions of a county which are not part of any town and have limited self-government (if any, as some are uninhabited). The population was 0 at the 2010 census. However, the gore does have a few hundred feet of dirt road and one building or structure, on the North Branch of the Nulhegan River by the Lewis town line. More prominently, Gore Mountain, one of the 50 highest in the state, is in the eastern portion of Averys Gore. History and name Averys Gore is named for Samuel Avery, a Westminster deputy sheriff and jailkeeper. Avery received roughly in eight separate gores and grants in the 1790s as compensation for land he had owned in a part of the state previously claimed by New York. The original charter (as reproduced in State Papers of Vermont, Volume Two: Charters Granted by the State of Vermont, VT Secretary of State, 1922, pp 9‚Äì11) merely mentions the boundaries of the tract of land, along with two others included in the same charter, granting them to Samuel Avery, but not mentioning any names for the tracts of land. State Papers of Vermont, Volume One: Index to the Papers of the Surveyors-General (VT Secretary of State, 1918) lists all the gores granted to Samuel Avery collectively as \\"Avery's Gores (Alias Vermont Grants to Samuel Avery)\\" (p. 31). While State of Vermont records seem to have consistently used the apostrophe, including state statutes (Title 17, Chapter 34, Section 1893, T. 24, Ch. 1, Sec. 6, and T. 24, Ch. 117, Sec. 4341(e)), the U.S. Board on Geographic Names eschews the use of apostrophes in geographic names, which may improperly imply personal possession. This has led to the use of both spellings. The apostrophe is omitted in Vermont Place-Names: Footprints of History by Esther M. Swift (The Stephen Greene Press, 1977, pp 198‚Äì9), in the Vermont Atlas and Gazetteer (Delorme, 9th ed., 1996, p. 55). Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the gore has a total area of , of which , or 0.19%, is water. The north side of the gore drains via several brooks into the Coaticook River, part of the St. Lawrence River basin, while the rest of the gore drains south via the North Branch of the Nulhegan River or the Black Branch of the Nulhegan and is part of the Connecticut River basin. Demographics As of the 2010 census, there are no people living in the gore.

Built by the Tennessee Central Railway in 1909, the depot served Cookeville until the 1950s when passenger train service to the city was phased out.Mary Jean DeLozier, Putnam County, Tennessee, 1850-1970 (Cookeville, Tenn.: 1979), pp. 93-101. The depot was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985 and is currently home to the Cookeville Depot Museum. Although it was often wrought with financial difficulties and struggled in the face of competition from the larger L&N; and Southern railroads, the construction of the Tennessee Central line was an important political and economic milestone for late-19th century Middle Tennessee. The railroad connected the residents of the Upper Cumberland region to the outside world, and gave the region's farmers access to major markets in Nashville and Knoxville. The railroad also brought urbanization and modern development to Cookeville and other cities in the Upper Cumberland and Cumberland Plateau regions.Carroll Van West, \\"Railroad, Tennessee Central.\\" Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture (Nashville, Tenn.: Rutledge Hill Press, 1998), pp. 768-769. Construction of the Tennessee Central 1913 Baldwin 4-6-0 #509 at the Cookeville Depot Museum After the Civil War, large-scale railroad construction occurred in East Tennessee and the Nashville and Memphis areas, but the difficult terrain of the Highland Rim and the Cumberland Plateau stalled the railroad's advance into the Upper Cumberland region. In the 1870s, the Tennessee and Pacific Railroad built a line connecting Nashville and Lebanon (this line was purchased by the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway in 1877). Politicians and newspaper reporters across the Upper Cumberland region initiated a massive publicity campaign in the early 1880s calling for the railroad to be extended across Middle Tennessee. Cupola- style caboose at the Cookeville Depot Museum In 1884, mining entrepreneur Alexander Crawford, believing the Upper Cumberland region to be endowed with vast deposits of high-quality coal, chartered the Nashville & Knoxville Railroad with plans to extend the railroad across the Cumberland Plateau and allow shipment of coal to markets in Nashville and Knoxville. Although a particularly difficult stretch between Watertown and Silver Point-- requiring the building of several trestles across the Caney Fork-- slowed the railroad's construction, the Nashville & Knoxville's tracks nevertheless reached Cookeville in July 1890. Although Crawford died shortly thereafter, his sons continued his work, and managed to extend the tracks to Monterey, at the edge of the Cumberland Plateau. In 1893, Middle Tennessee businessman Jere Baxter (1852-1904) chartered the Tennessee Central Railroad with plans to continue what Crawford had started. Like Crawford, Baxter faced major economic obstacles. He raised funds by selling bonds to Cumberland and Roane counties, and saved money by using convict labor. He also had to overcome legal maneuvering by the L&N; and Southern railroads, who feared the Tennessee Central's competition. In 1898, the Tennessee Central completed its eastern section, connecting Monterey with the Southern tracks at Harriman. Baxter purchased the Nashville & Knoxville Railroad in 1902, and two years later the Tennessee Central completed a line from Nashville to the Illinois Central tracks at Hopkinsville, Kentucky, thus connecting Middle Tennessee to the rest of the country. Cookeville residents could now travel all the way to Minnesota via 10-hour train ride. After Baxter's death in 1904, the Tennessee Central continued to struggle with financing. It attempted lease arrangements with both the Illinois Central and Southern Railroad, but by 1908 these arrangements had been abandoned. In 1912, the Tennessee Central was placed in receivership, and in subsequent years was reorganized with more of a focus on freight traffic. By the mid-20th century, the rise of automobile and bus travel brought about the decline of passenger trains. The last passenger train left Cookeville on July 31, 1955. Cookeville Depot The Nashville & Knoxville Railroad constructed the first railroad depot at Cookeville in the 1890s. The mere announcement of the company's plans for the depot \\"one half- mile west of the courthouse\\" caused property values in the western section of town to skyrocket. Along with the depot, N&K; built a two-story office building, a reservoir, and several repair shops. The Tennessee Central replaced the N&K; depot with the present pagoda-like structure in 1909, although it moved the service facilities to Monterey. The presence of the railroad depot led to a boom in housing construction in Cookeville. Residences were built along or near the tracks, and a shanty town known as \\"Boxtown\\" developed in the vicinity of what is now Cookeville Regional Medical Center. Shops lined the road between the depot and the courthouse square, culminating in a large shopping mall known as \\"The Arcade,\\" which was located across the street from the Putnam County Courthouse. The railroad also made possible the establishment of Dixie College and Tennessee Polytechnic Institute-- the forerunners of Tennessee Technological University.Austin Wheeler Smith, The Story of Tennessee Tech (Cookeville, Tenn.: 1957), pp. 5-6. Cookeville Depot Museum The City of Cookeville, with help from the nonprofit group Friends of the Depot, currently maintains the Cookeville Depot as a museum. Along with the depot, the museum maintains a collection of train cars and railroad memorabilia. Engine #509, a 4-6-0 ten-wheeler built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1913, originally used by the Louisiana and Arkansas Railway, was acquired by the museum in 2002 from the Tennessee Valley Railroad Museum and its appearance modified to match contemporary Tennessee Central engines. The museum acquired an L&N; bay window caboose (with a newer gray-and-yellow paint scheme, as opposed to the traditional red) in 1985, and in 2005 restored a red cupola-style caboose to its original appearance.Information obtained from interpretive signs at the Cookeville Depot Museum, 2008.

Common techniques include the use of spill berms to contain oil-filled equipment, fuel tanks, truck washing decks, or any other places or items that may leak hazardous liquids. Definition Secondary spill containment involves the sequestration of hazardous waste to prevent the contamination of local soils and water. In the electrical utility industry Adaptable Secondary Oil Containment around a Transformer. United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) guidelines require that facilities that store large quantities of petroleum (products) must have a plan in place to contain a spill. The purpose of the SPCC rule is to establish requirements for facilities to prevent a discharge of oil into navigable waters or adjoining shorelines. Within the electric utility industry, oil-filled transformers are often in need of secondary containment. Outdated secondary containment techniques such as concrete catch- basins are quickly losing ground to solutions that offer more cost-effective cleanup in case of a spill or leak. One example of a more cost-effective method involves placing a geotextile boom filled with oil solidifying polymers around a transformer. These geotextile barriers allow for flow of water, but completely solidify oil in the event of a leak and effectively seal the spill. Many electrical utility companies are switching to this method because it saves them significant amounts of money when a spill occurs, because there is no need to employ vac-trucks afterwards to clean up a spill inside a catch- basin. Portable spill containment Portable spill containment around fracking equipment Portable containment berms are essentially a basin that can catch many different types of hazardous liquids and chemicals. They are a form of secondary spill containment useful for containing mobile equipment such as oil drums, trucks, tankers and trailers. Unlike geotextile berms, portable berms usually do not solidify oil. Many companies involved in fracking use spill containment berms to capture contaminated water that is a by-product of the operation. Each well site has multiple trucks that transport water used in deep well drilling procedure.

Between 1951 and 1973 the city was divided into six districts: Stare Miasto, Zwierzyniec, Kleparz, Grzeg√≥rzki, Podg√≥rze and Nowa Huta. From 1973 until the introduction of the present division in 1991 there were four districts: ≈ör√≥dmie≈õcie (\\"City Centre\\"), Podg√≥rze, Krowodrza and Nowa Huta.

Krak√≥w's historic centre, covering the Old Town, Wawel and Kazimierz, was entered on the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites in 1978. Krak√≥w has the most prominent example of an old town in the country, because for many centuries, Krak√≥w was the royal capital of Poland, until Sigismund III Vasa relocated the court to Warsaw in 1596. Medieval Krak√≥w was surrounded by a 1.9 mile (3 km) defensive wall complete with 46 towers and seven main entrances leading through them. The fortifications around the Old Town were erected over the course of two centuries. The current architectural plan of Stare Miasto‚Äîthe 13th-century merchants' town‚Äîwas drawn up following the Tatar invasions of 1259 and 1287.Andrew Beattie, Landmark Publishing, Tim Pepper, Stare Miasto, the Old Town, Krakow Published by Hunter Publishing It features the centrally located Rynek G≈Ç√≥wny, or Main Square, the largest medieval town square of any European city.

Nowa Huta Nowa Huta Nowa Huta (literally \\"New Steel Mill\\") is the easternmost district of Krak√≥w, numbered XVIII. With more than 200,000 inhabitants it is one of the most populous areas of the city. The historic area of present-day Nowa Huta is one of the few places in Poland settled continuously since the neolithic period. Archeological research has discovered a big Celtic settlement and Poland's oldest Slavic settlements there. A mound was erected by Vistulans in the 8th century. According to legend, the Wanda Mound is a tomb of Wanda, daughter of Krak, a mythical founder of Krak√≥w. In the 13th century a Cistercian monastery was built in the easternmost village of Mogi≈Ça, called the Mogi≈Ça Abbey. Nowa Huta was built from the ground up in 1949 as a separate town near Krak√≥w on terrain resumed by the Communist Government from former villages of Mogi≈Ça, Plesz√≥w and Krzes≈Çawice. It was planned as a huge centre of heavy industry around the new Lenin Steelworks. The town was to become an ideal town for the communist propaganda and populated mostly by industrial workers (see: Socialist realism in Poland). In 1951 it was joined with Krak√≥w as its new district and the following year tramway communication was started. Since the fall of Communism the city district that was once a showpiece for Stalinism now boasts many tributes to ardent anti-Communism. Streets formerly named after Lenin and the Cuban Revolution have been renamed to honor Pope John Paul II and the Polish exile leader W≈Çadys≈Çaw Anders. In 2004 Plac Centralny, Nowa Huta's central square which once was home to a giant statue of Lenin - on display at High Chaparral Museum in Hillerstorp Sweden, was renamed Ronald Reagan Central Square (Plac Centralny im. Ronalda Reagana) in honor of the former U.S. President.The story at www.expatica.com However, this decision led to many protests,Nowa Huta at www.zyciekrakowa.pl and the traditional name is still widely used.

Musical style Bajah + the Dry Eye Crew‚Äôs music blends many influences with hip hop, including funk, dancehall, and reggae. They are part of a growing international hip hop movement, though they are among the first of these acts to gain an international presence, culminating in the upcoming release of their international debut, slated for an early 2014 release under their record labels, Modiba Productions and Nat Geo Music.http://www.planetbajah.com Their live shows are celebrated for their electricity and the energy they generate in the crowd, and this reputation has earned them confirmed collaborations for their upcoming LP with some of hip hop‚Äôs most influential figures, including ?uestlove and Black Thought of The Roots, Talib Kweli, K'naan, Res, and El-P.

Origins Bajah + the Dry Eye Crew began performing together in 2000 in a war-torn Freetown, Sierra Leone, quickly gaining a legion of fans who lovingly dubbed them their \\"voice for the voiceless.\\"http://planetbajah.com Their fans have been known to go to great lengths to express their love for the musicians, even rolling out an impromptu \\"red carpet\\" to welcome them to a performance: \\"When we have a show in the national stadium, you see these guys making a long line, taking off their T-shirts and putting them on the floor so we can walk on it as a mat to go on the stage,\\" A-Klass remembers. Their international visibility began when one of their songs was featured in the Academy Award-nominated film Blood Diamond, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, and continued to grow when the crew released their single \\"Ease Di Tension\\" as a free download just before Sierra Leone‚Äôs 2007 elections, the first since the beginning of its civil war. Activism This type of outreach has gained the group a reputation of humanitarianism and social awareness, which they cite as the inspiration for their moniker: as \\"dry eye\\" is a colloquial phrase in Sierra Leone for \\"boldness.\\" \\"The kids that always try to ask questions and want to know things are the dry eye. If you always coming up to talk to the elder people, trying to ask them certain questions, they say, 'Oh, you, you're dry eye,' like, 'You're bold. You're too bold!'\\" Bajah explains. \\"But we just use dry eye because we decide to talk about the bad things going on. Cause the leaders, we take them as our fathers‚Äîbut we still gonna say some things, the reality. We just gonna stand, no matter what. No more tears in the eye.

The specification called for a four-engined long-range reconnaissance flying boat. The Admiralty ordered two aircraft from Fairey and one from Phoenix Dynamo Manufacturing Company. Fairey sub-contracted the building of the second to Dick, Kerr & Co. of Lytham St. Annes. Not unusual for the era, the design was a biplane, with the engines mounted as two push-pull pairs between the upper and lower wing, each driving a four-bladed propeller. The first N.4 (named Atalanta) was that assembled by Phoenix Dynamo with a hull designed by Charles Nicholson, built by the Gosport Aircraft Company was also transported to the Isle of Grain, but never flown and scrapped as the service lost interest in large flying boats. During April 1919 when the hull was complete, Flight reported the aircraft would be even larger than the Felixstowe Fury. The second N.4 (also named Atalanta) completed in 1921, first flew on 4 July 1923 powered by four 650 hp (485 kW) Rolls-Royce Condor IA piston engines. The hull built in Hythe by May, Harden & May and delivered to Lytham St. Annes for assembly. The complete aircraft was then dismantled, taken by road to the Isle of Grain and stored before for its first flight. The third N.4 Mk.II (named Titania) included improvements and later variant Condor III engines.

Los Vaqueros Reservoir, located between Livermore and Brentwood in the Diablo Range, is on and named for the former rancho. Vasco Road passes through the site. It was given in 1844 by Governor Manuel Micheltorena to Antonio Higuera, Francisco Alviso and Manuel Miranda.Ogden Hoffman, 1862, Reports of Land Cases Determined in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Numa Hubert, San Francisco The name means \\"Canyon of the Cowboys\\" in Spanish. History Antonio Higuera, Francisco Alviso and Manuel Miranda were granted the four league rancho in 1844. Dise√±o del Rancho Ca√±ada de los Vaqueros Jose Antonio Higuera (1795 - ), who was married to Josefa Antonio Alviso, was the uncle of brothers-in-law Francisco Alviso (1818 - ) and Manuel Miranda (1816 - ). Francisco Alviso was married to Maria Isabela Miranda, and Manuel Ciriaco Miranda was married to Maria Del Carmen Alviso. In 1847 Alviso and Miranda sold their interests to Jose Noriega and Robert Livermore who also owned Rancho Las Positas to the south. With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho Ca√±ada de los Vaqueros was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1852. Report of the Surveyor General 1844 - 1886 United States. District Court (California : Northern District) Land Case 386 ND In 1854, Livermore and Noriega came to an agreement, where Livermore purchased Noriega's half of Rancho Las Positas and sold his half of Rancho Ca√±ada de los Vaqueros to Noriega. This was the beginning of several lawsuits, and the ownership of the property was not resolved until 1897. Noriega hired an attorney, and gave him a half interest in Rancho Ca√±ada de los Vaqueros in lieu of fee, and sold the other half to Maximo Fernandez. Both halves of Rancho Ca√±ada de los Vaqueros were again sold in separate transactions in 1857. Unknown to Noriega, Livermore had already conveyed his interest in Rancho Ca√±ada de los Vaqueros to his wife and children in 1852; so that the deed from Livermore to Noriega in fact conveyed nothing, in as much as Livermore had then no title to convey. When Livermore died in 1858, his widow and children claimed Rancho Ca√±ada de los Vaqueros based on the deed predating the Noriega transfer. At the same time, the four children of Antonio Higuera claimed a one third interest in Rancho Ca√±ada de los Vaqueros. By 1860, various parties held deeds totaling nearly twice the Rancho Ca√±ada de los Vaqueros grant. Finally in 1897 Mary Crocker, heir to Charles McLaughlin, was the owner of the entire rancho.

He was also a noted sportsman and businessman.'''  Early Life & Sporting Career  He was born in Nenagh, Co. Tipperary and educated at Presentation College Bray, Co. Wicklow and the Engineering College in Cork, part of University College Cork. This led to a scholarship to study aeronautical engineering at the London College of Aeronautical Engineering, and from there he joined the RAF. His sporting career began at this time. He was particularly gifted on the rugby field where he played for a Leinster Schools XV against both Connacht and Munster in the 1928‚Äì29 season. He also won a Munster Senior Cup medal with Dolphin during the 1930‚Äì31 season. In England he played for London Irish and the RAF. The 1935 edition of Who‚Äôs Who in Sport listed his activities as rugby, boxing, tennis, golf, and swimming, in the first two of which he represented the RAF. He was Captain of London Irish in 1949, and played his last game at the age of 40 in 1951. During the period he also had international rugby trials for Ireland twice, although nothing came of them due to service commitments. He went on to play squash at the highest level, and his career as an amateur golfer reached its apex with winning the Gleneagles Hotel Foursomes Tournament in 1959, in which most of the country‚Äôs biggest names participated that year.  RAF Officer  His high placing in aeronautical engineering exams offered a career in the Royal Air Force, then expanding to meet the threat of European fascism. After qualifying as a fighter pilot and Flying Boat Captain, he served at RAF Wittering, with 29 (F) Squadron ADGB (Air Defence of Great Britain) in Egypt in 1935. Back in England he was posted to 23 (F) Squadron at RAF Biggin Hill in 1936, and 213 Squadron at Northolt. Northolt was to see the end of his flying career, because on 12 April 1937 he suffered a serious flying accident that left him with extensive third degree burns and a 6-month spell in hospital. It was not, however the end of his RAF career which up to now had been unremarkable. When World War 2 broke out the following year he reported to his old station Biggin Hill where, with his recent active flying experience, he was invaluable as a Controller. By the summer of 1940 he had become a Squadron Leader, and a legend in the Control Room, a legend much enhanced by the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau affair. Coming on duty at 7a.m. on 12 February 1942 he noticed aircraft movements seaward of the French port of Brest that the previous controller had dismissed as air-sea rescue, but that he deduced must have been escorting capital ships because of their speed. What he had seen was what British forces were expecting, the break out of a powerful German flotilla which included the Scharnhorst, Gneisenau and Prinz Eugen from Brest where they had been under heavy attack by Coastal and Bomber Command. A code word had been arranged for this eventuality and Igoe used it. It was one of the several disasters in the chain of events of this famous Channel Dash that it was not acted upon. An attack by a Royal Naval destroyer, which was badly damaged, and the suicidal assault on the ships by unsuited and slow-moving Fairey Swordfish torpedo aircraft of the Fleet Air arm, commanded by Lieutenant Commander Eugene Esmonde, failed to stop the flotilla from reaching German waters. Controlling had turned him into a specialist in the infant radar equipment, and 1943 saw him posted to command RAF Beachy Head, one of the famous ‚ÄúChain Home‚Äù stations which now became a Fighter Direction Station, and from where he was to spend the rest of the war developing the use of Radar for Fighter Control based on the famous ‚ÄúType 16‚Äù.  Business and family  In 1937 he met and married Karin Ridsdel, daughter of accountant and financier E. B. Ridsdel. After the war Igoe bought what remained of his father-in-law‚Äôs business, Ridsdel having died in 1939. It had worldwide interests, notably in Africa, on which he built. In Rhodesia he started a tea plantation industry, which would end up employing some 5,000 people. He also started the carpet manufacturing industry there. He and his wife, who were inseparable, had three sons, the first of whom died in infancy and the other two who survived him. In his lifetime he had seven grandchildren. He held views on political and social issues that were way ahead of his time. He was always entertaining and sharp witted, and never lost the common touch. At his funeral in 1993 the tea estate workers who attended would call him munhu re vanhu ‚Äì a man of the people. References *J. E. Johnson, Wing Leader, Ballantine Books 1957 *Alan C.

Erich and Martin Verg considered a document called \\"the first Reze√ü\\" of 1410 as the first constitution of Hamburg, although it has had no democratically founded proceedings to establish it. The first official constitution was established on 28 September 1860. It introduced a form of representative democracy with limitations on the right to vote, e.g. only males could vote. On 13 October 1879 a new constitution (Verfassung der freien und Hansestadt Hamburg) was created. After the First World War in 1919 in the parliamentary Weimar Republic, the Hamburg Parliament ratified a temporary constitution (titled Gesetz √ºber die Vorl√§ufige Staatsgewalt), with an official constitution (titled Verfassung der Freien und Hansestadt Hamburg) being formally approved in 1921. The constitution of 1952 was ratified by the Hamburg Parliament.  Content  The constitution consists of 76 articles and a preamble. Dieter L√§pple noted the importance placed by the preamble on the fact that Hamburg is a port and trade city, stating the following: It is divided into the following sections: *legal foundations (I). In contrast to the other two city-states Berlin and Bremen the constitution does not separate between state (Land) and local communal affairs. *sections for the Hamburg Parliament (II) and senate (III) *law (IV) and administration (V) *jurisdiction (VI) *budget and finance (VII) *and final and transitional provisions (VIII) Because the constitution was approved in 1959, after the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany (approved in 1949)‚Äîwhich is the document that establishes and describes the duties, powers, structure and function of the government in Germany and legal also for the German states (federal law supersedes state law)‚Äîa section outlining human or basic rights (fundamental rights) is missing.  Constitutional institutions  The legislature is the Hamburg Parliament, the judiciary is the Hamburg Constitutional Court (Hamburgisches Verfassungsgericht) and the executive is represented by the senate (the cabinet), which is headed by the First Mayor of Hamburg (Erster B√ºrgermeister der Freien und Hansestadt Hamburg), a position equivalent to a prime minister or minister-president.

In addition the airfield contained a large parking apron, as well as for dispersal sites. Tents were used for billeting and also for support facilities; an access road was built to the existing road infrastructure; a dump for supplies, ammunition, and gasoline drums, along with a drinkable water and minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting. It was known as Tantonville Airfield or Advanced Landing Ground Y-1 and released to Ninth Air Force on 25 December 1944. The XIX Tactical Air Command 100th Fighter Wing 371st Fighter Group moved onto the field even before it was officially completed on 20 December, with three squadrons of P-47 Thunderbolts. They remained until 15 February until moving east. The Twelfth Air Force 86th Fighter Group and its 525th, 526th, and 527th Squadrons operated P-47 Thunderbolts from the airfield between late February to mid-April 1945 before moving east to a captured Luftwaffe airfield at Braunshardt, Germany (Y-72) near Darmstadt. After the 86th moved out the airfield was manned by the 98th Service Squadron. It was used as a resupply and casualty evacuation airfield for the balance of the war. It was then dismantled and the land returned to civil authorities on 11 May 1945. The area where Tantonville Airfield was constructed is now an agricultural area, although the ground still shows evidence of its runway and parking apron.

Cheever Goodwin, adapted from the French farce Le bapt√™me du petit Oscar by Eug√®ne Grang√© and Victor Bernard. The story concerns a missing child and its nursemaid, three competing potential godfathers and an opera diva. It was produced at the Fifth Avenue Theatre in New York City on September 16, 1896, and ran with success.Bordman, Gerald and Richard Norton. American Musical Theatre: A Chronicle (1978), p. 169 It was directed by Ben Teal, the musical director was John McGhie and dances in act 4 were arranged by Rose Becket. The show was made into a 1908 film of the same name.\\"Lost, Strayed or Stolen (1908)\\", The New York Times, accessed September 13, 2015  Background  One of the first shows created for the Theatrical Syndicate, it had its premiere in Chicago, Illinois on June 15, 1896. Jennie Goldthwaite was originally scheduled to play the female lead, Rose D'Ete, but she became indisposed and was relieved by Georgia Caine, who had been assigned the role of the nursemaid. After Caine replaced Goldthwaite, Florence Thornton was hired to play the nursemaid. Subsequent to its New York run, the musical toured, opening at the Boston Theatre, on April 12, 1897. It eventually returned to New York at the Harlem Opera House in December 1897. It also played in London, at the Duke of York's Theatre in 1897, featuring Decima Moore, with dances by John D'Auban.Duke of York's Theatre playbill, 27 April 1897  Plot = Act 1, in Bidart's parlor salesrooms = The musical opens with the christening of a baby boy, son of Bidart, a Parisian florist. He has invited a relative to be the godfather. Unknown to him, his wife and mother- in-law have also invited people to be the godfather. To further complicate matters, the child's nurse, while strolling in the park with the baby, was speaking to an admirer while a policeman took the child away, and now returns tearfully revealing the child is missing. The act ends with all going to search for the child. =Act 2, in the 22nd barracks at Pepini√®re = Since the nursemaid was speaking to a policeman, Bidart and company have arrived at the barracks of the 22nd Regiment. Circumstances force Bidart and his party to wear uniforms, where they are mistaken for undisciplined members of the regiment. Unseen, one of the policemen returns the baby to the nursemaid and they depart. This occurs before Bidart and party realize, and they continue their search. Meanwhile, one of the potential godfathers drops out. =Act 3, in the boudoir of Rose d'Ete = The nursemaid is the employee of Rose d'Ete, a famous Parision opera bouffe prima donna, who supposedly now has the child. When Bidart and his party enter to search for the baby, their identities are confused with those of Rose d'Ete's paramour; when the paramour arrives they pretend they are workmen. They finally learn that the baby has been taken back to the park where he was originally lost. The second of the potential godfathers drops out. =Act 4, in a corner of the gardens of the Luxembourg = The child has been traced to the gardens of Luxembourg. While Bidart searches, the remaining potential godfather gets into trouble by claiming and endeavoring to kidnap a baby and pretend it is the missing one. The climax occurs at the entrance of the christening procession: to the surprise of the three potential godfathers, the baby has been found and christened in their absence.

The country rock at the mine was killas and its main produce was lead ore (galena), but as is usual when mining this mineral, commercial quantities of silver and zinc were also found and sold. Lead was found in the area in 1812 and in 1834 the mine was established, by 1846 the mine employed over 1,200 men, women and children. The two main lodes, called Middleton's Lode and East Lode, trended north-south. The ore they contained was in places very soft and loose and the killas was also not a particularly strong rock, necessitating extensive underground timbering, particularly in the shafts. Records show that the mine had more than twenty shafts on the two lodes, and the deepest workings were at 150 fathoms (900 ft). Disaster in 1846 The mine was sited in the valley of a small stream at the point where it opens out into a natural bowl and is virtually surrounded by hills. The outlet from this bowl is through a narrow ravine through which the stream flows into the River Gannel. Just after noon on 9 July 1846 there was an unusually heavy thunderstorm which lasted an hour and a quarter. Captain Middleton, the mine manager, reported that within five minutes of it starting to rain, water was flowing down the hills in torrents. Despite efforts by the men on the surface to dam or divert the water from the shafts the mine was rapidly flooded up to the 50 fathom (300 ft) level, and of the estimated 200 miners who were underground at the time, 39 were drowned. Later history Despite the setback the mine soon reopened and continued producing ore until it closed in 1886. A 90-inch engine, supplied by Messrs Harvey and company of Hayle, came into operation on 3 June 1882 and when the of main adit level was cleared, several lodes were discovered and the Middleton's lode was longer than previously thought. The engine was christened ‚Ä≥Inne's Engine‚Ä≥ by Lady Innes. Between 1845 and 1885 it produced 48,200 tons of 62% lead ore, 212,700 ounces of silver and 280 tons of zinc ore. Today, apart from the preserved engine house and chimney stack (which stands at 120ft high), there are few remains of the mine visible. The site is a tourist attraction with a boating lake, crazy golf etc. It is at one end of the Lappa Valley Steam Railway which follows part of the route of one of the Treffry Tramways that was opened in 1849 for hauling ore from the mine to Newquay.

Pomerantz was credited with identifying this as a zoonotic disease spread through mice and the mites that infested them. After culturing and isolating the organism in laboratory mice, the pathogen they named Rickettsia akari was identified as the ultimate cause of the disease now called rickettsialpox.

It emerged from the Prussian Army personnel department in the wake of the 1809 reform of the military, and was officially established 3 June 1814. It developed under Emperor Wilhelm II into a personal instrument of the monarch for processing all military matters. The Chief of the Military Cabinet (Chef des Milit√§rkabinetts) was often at the same time Adjutant General (chief aide-de-camp) to the monarch and subordinate only to him. The king appointed all members of the Military Cabinet and the chief had the coveted Immediatvortrag, direct personal access to the king, which even the chief of the Great General Staff and the Minister of War did not have. The cabinet was essentially a privy council to the monarch and its constitutional position was unclear. It was modernized under the leadership of Edwin Freiherr von Manteuffel, from 1856/1857 to 1865. During Austro-Prussian War of 1866 and the 1870‚Äì71 Franco-Prussian War the chief of the Military Cabinet was a member of the army headquarters staff. With the emergence of the Imperial German Army after 1871 the powers of the Military Cabinet were enlarged. It remained a Prussian authority and functioned as the cabinet of the imperial army command. Until 1918 it was officially the \\"Military Cabinet of His Majesty the Emperor and King\\". The chief handled normal communications between the Emperor and other military authorities and was the only military officer to meet with the Emperor several times a week. Over time the cabinet became a great center of power. It had great influence on Wilhelm I, and gained even more on Wilhelm II. During the First World War, the Military Cabinet lost favor to the Third Supreme Command of Hindenburg and Ludendorff. With the overthrow of the monarchy the Military Cabinet became the \\"Personnel Office of War Ministry\\" (Personalamt im Kriegsministerium) on 7 December 1918.

The album was at the time credited to The Melvilles, being one of the names used by Moby Grape during the course of their protracted dispute with former manager Matthew Katz over ownership of the band name and related royalties. The tapes were remastered by Dig Music, and eight additional songs were added for the release of Legendary Grape.Richie Unterberger, [ Review of Legendary Grape]; www.allmusic.com. The album was recorded by original Moby Grape members Peter Lewis, Jerry Miller, Bob Mosley and Don Stevenson. All group members contributed songs, as had been the case during all of the band's history. However, whereas in the past Jerry Miller and Don Stevenson had generally written together, including some of Moby Grape's best known songs,Such as \\"Hey Grandma\\" from Moby Grape (1967) and \\"Murder In My Heart For The Judge\\", from Wow/Grape Jam (1968). both were now writing exclusively separately. Founding member Skip Spence was not well enough to perform, though one of his songs was included on the recording. It was the practice of Spence's bandmates to try to include at least one of his songs on every Moby Grape recording, irrespective of Spence's ability to participate in the recording.

The school plans to add high school classes in English for the 2005/6 school year, offering grade 7. Each year an additional grade will be added. In the year 2004, the school was officially recognised by the Cambodian government as a primary school.

KPFZ's staff, including board members, programmers, and hosts are volunteers. History KPFZ began as a pirate radio station in Lucerne in 1996, broadcasting in a limited fashion (weekends, and evenings mostly). In 1997‚Äì1998, the pirate station applied for a full power broadcasting license. In 2000, and while volunteers awaited the U.S. Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) decision regarding the pirate's full power license application, the station applied for a low power license. Through grass root efforts, the pirate station was granted an FCC low-power license in 2001. At that time the call letters KPFZ were implemented. The inspiration for these call letters came from Pacifica Radio network's listener-supported stations such as KPFA. The station began broadcasting as KPFZ 104.5LP-FM, and was the first station in California's radio history to be licensed as such (LP-FM). On April 25, 2005, a construction permit was issued for the broadcasting of KPFZ 88.1fm 'full-power' (100 watts, or more, of signal strength). This effectively ended the stations low-power broadcast as preparing for the larger broadcasting signal and paying for the continuance of the low-power station proved to be too costly. By mid 2006-early 2007 KPFZ began broadcasting as full power KPFZ 88.1fm \\"Real Radio for Lake County, CA and Beyond.\\" In 2014 KPFZ had four committees (from web-development to fundraising), and more than nine titled volunteer staff positions. KPFZ has experienced growth as a grass-roots community media outlet since its inception in 1996. Programming The founders, and volunteers of KPFZ and their collective dream of a full power localized media outlet, concentrating on issues affecting Lake County residents, giving a voice to minorities in the county, and commercial free music had been realized.

The film follows Johnny Marco (played by Stephen Dorff), a newly famous actor, as he recuperates from a minor injury at the Chateau Marmont, a well-known Hollywood retreat. Despite money, fame and professional success, Marco is trapped in an existential crisis and has an emotionally empty daily life. When his ex-wife suffers an unexplained breakdown and goes away, she leaves Cleo (Elle Fanning), their 11-year-old daughter, in his care. They spend time together and her presence helps Marco mature and accept adult responsibility. The film explores ennui among Hollywood stars, the father‚Äìdaughter relationship and offers an oblique comedy of show business, particularly Hollywood film-making and the life of a \\"star\\". Somewhere premiered at the 67th Venice International Film Festival where it received the Golden Lion award for best picture. Critical opinion was mildly positive. Reviewers praised the patience of the film's visual style and its empathy for a handful of characters, but some found Somewhere to be too repetitive of themes in Coppola's previous work, or did not sympathize with the protagonist because of his relative success. It was released to theaters in the United Kingdom and Ireland on December 10, 2010, and in the United States on December 22, 2010. Plot As the film opens a black Ferrari circles on a race track in the desert, its engine roaring in and out of the shot. When it eventually stops, Johnny Marco steps out. Marco is a young and recently divorced Hollywood actor who, despite his recent rise to fame, does not feel much meaning in his daily life. He resides at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles from where he completes various publicity obligations for his new film: he is photographed with his co-star, gives interviews to the press, and attends an award ceremony in Italy. Presently, he is nursing a broken wrist in a plaster arm cast. Despite drinking and socializing occasionally with Sammy, a fellow actor and childhood friend, Marco spends much time alone, driving his Ferrari motorcar, drinking beer, taking pills, and having casual sex with various women and aspiring starlets. Twice he has pole-dancing twins set up their equipment and perform in his room, the first time he falls asleep and the second routine is more calisthenic than erotic.Ebert, R. Review:Somewhere Chicago Sun-Times, December 21, 2010. Retrieved January 10, 2010. He receives an unexpected visit from his 11-year-old daughter Cleo. Cleo's stay changes his lifestyle little at first, including his indulging an overnight visitor, a blonde woman. Johnny and his daughter spend time together in his hotel suite and he brings her with him on his daily routine and on a publicity trip to Milan (where he is awarded with a \\"Telegatto\\", in a show with local celebrities playing themselves), and through preparations for her departure to summer camp. As their time together grows, Johnny's fatherly emotions emerge and force him to re-assess his otherwise \\"successful\\" life. After Cleo leaves for camp Johnny calls his ex-wife and tearfully breaks down admitting to his inadequacies and his unhappiness about being unsupportive of his family. His ex-wife seems indifferent and declines his request to come see him. Johnny checks out of the hotel promising not to return, and drives his Ferrari into the countryside looking for something new to turn a new leaf. Eventually, he stops by the roadside and gets out, leaving behind his Ferrari with the keys left inside, and walking in a new direction down the highway smiling. Cast * Stephen Dorff as Johnny Marco * Elle Fanning as Cleo * Chris Pontius as Sammy, a fellow actor and childhood friend of Johnny * Michelle Monaghan as actress playing co-star to Johnny * Kristina and Karissa Shannon as pole-dancing twins Production Somewhere was set in and filmed on location at the Chateau Marmont hotel in Los Angeles. Scenes from the film are said to be inspired by the director's childhood experiences as the daughter of Francis Ford Coppola. She recalls sampling all the gelato flavors on a Milanese hotel's room service menu, a trip to Italy, a helicopter ride, and though she said there was a \\"personal connection\\" to the film, she denied it was an autobiography. Rather, she based the character of Cleo on a friend's daughter whose parents work in Hollywood and used her own experiences to relate to the character and add a realistic touch. Federico Fellini's Toby Dammit (1968) has also been noted as an influence. Meanwhile, the parental focus of the film developed because Coppola had recently had her second child. Coppola said that she thought of Dorff to play Marco early while writing the film, because he had an aura of \\"the bad-boy actor,\\" but also \\"this really sweet, sincere side.\\" Coppola wanted a minimalist look for the film, especially after the mixed reactions to her richly costumed Marie Antoinette. The overall effect was to be \\"sweet and genuine but without being sappy.\\" For the visual style she discussed Bruce Weber's Hollywood portraits and Helmut Newton's photographs of models at the Chateau Marmont, and Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975), a film by Chantal Akerman about the routine of a Belgian housewife, with Harris Savides, the cinematographer. He said, \\"The main thing was to tell the story really simply and let it play out in long beats and have the audience discover the moment.\\" Coppola used the lenses that her father had used to film Rumble Fish (1983) in an effort to give the film a more period look, although it is set in the present. Before filming began Dorff, Fanning, and Lala Sloatman (who plays Marco's ex-wife) improvised meals and fights to understand the family's dynamic. Dorff also collected Fanning from school and they spent an afternoon together to bond. Dorff stayed in the Chateau Marmont during principal photography, making it easier to get to the set and understand the character. Coppola also showed Dorff Paper Moon (1973) during production.Matheson, W. 16 things I learned from Sofia Coppola and Stephen Dorff \\"Pop Candy\\", USA Today, December 16, 2010 =Cinematography= Filming took place in Los Angeles and Italy in June and July 2009. Benicio del Toro, Erin Wasson and members of the band Rooney have cameos in the film. In a feature for The New York Times website, Coppola discussed making the scene when Marco visits a special effects studio. She said she initially was unsure of how to approach it, but Savides did a long, slow zoom which captures his breathing and creates a sense of claustrophobia. Despite many takes, Dorff was a \\"good sport\\", she said. The sound of the phone ringing was added by Sarah Flack, the editor, to indicate that Marco has been forgotten.Anatomy of a Scene: 'Somewhere' The New York Times, December 15, 2010 =Soundtrack= Phoenix, a French rock band, contributed the film's score. Coppola is married to Thomas Mars, the band's singer; she liked the songs \\"Love Like a Sunset Part I\\" and \\"Love Like a Sunset Part II\\" and requested the band do similar music for the film. In 2010 the film score for Somewhere was announced, but remains unreleased. Except for The Strokes song during the poolside scene, the score is diegetic.

She sees, and we see exactly what she sees. There is little attempt here to observe a plot. All the attention is on the handful of characters, on Johnny.\\" A.O. Scott in The New York Times called the film \\"exquisite, melancholy and formally audacious\\" and said \\"This is not a matter of imitation, but rather of mastery, of finding ‚Äî by borrowing if necessary ‚Äî a visual vocabulary suited to the story and its environment. If you pay close attention, \\"Somewhere\\" will show you everything.\\" Peter Bradshaw disagreed in The Guardian, awarding the film two stars from five. He praised the cinematic technique but said that the film resembled Lost in Translation too closely, lacked emotional depth and that even on second viewing \\"the question of why we should really care or be interested remains tantalisingly unanswered\\"; the final shot failed to solve any emotional problems and \\"really is one of the daftest things I have seen for a long time.\\"Bradshaw, Peter Somewhere-Review The Guardian December 9, 2010 Allocin√©, a French cinema website, calculated a score of 2.9 stars out of 5 from twenty-six press reviews.Somewhere:Critiques Presse French newspaper Le Monde gave the film a positive review, saying Somewhere was Coppola's most minimalist and daring film. Coppola's films, it said, deal with \\"the delicate irony of the delinquency of a universe of the happy few\\", which is both to her credit and a ghost which haunts her, a loyalty ensnaring her.\\"Somewhere\\": Hollywood, capitale du spleen, du toc, du rien Le Monde, January 4, 2011 France 24 said the \\"virtuosity of Coppola is also in her keeping empathy for the characters without pouring out mushy sentiment.\\"\\"Somewhere\\", ou les jeunes obsessions de Sofia Coppola France 24 January 5, 2011 Richard Roeper listed Somewhere as one of the top ten films of 2010. Interpretation=Celebrity ennui= Coppola's first three films examine feminine self-definition and maturation, usually in privileged circumstance. Lost in Translation (2003) depicts an encounter and brief friendship between two lonely Americans in a luxurious Tokyo hotel; Marie Antoinette (2006), a stylized biopic of the eponymous queen, examined her loneliness. Somewhere examines similar themes of success and isolation, but from a male perspective. The film explores Marco's seclusion and depression despite his outward professional success and the resulting wealth and fame. He appears to suffer from anhedonia, the inability to feel pleasure, but the film itself is reticent in suggesting its causes. \\"He believes he's nothing\\", summarized film critic Roger Ebert, \\"and it appears he's correct\\". The film's opening shot, a Ferrari circling a race-track in and out of a stationary camera position, its whine and roar rising and falling, establishes the theme of ennui. The sequence's length also offers a visual cue from Coppola to relax, observe and withhold expectations. Coppola said she wanted to hint at this with a simple camera set-up, \\"so you're alone with this guy and not aware that it's a movie. But I hope it's a welcome contrast to the style of most movies out there. Something that gives you a chance to take a breath\\". The Chateau Marmont, a well-known retreat for Hollywood celebrities, is the film's setting and can be \\"either a paradise of easy wish-fulfillment or a purgatory of celebrity anomie\\" (A.O. Scott), but Coppola subtly conveys the emptiness of Marco's situation without denying its appeal.Scott, A.O. The Pampered Life, Viewed from the Inside The New York Times, December 21, 2010 Coppola has stayed at the hotel, and said \\"I've seen a few Johnny Marcos\\"; in contrast, writing the part of the daughter, she drew on childhood experiences with her director father, Francis Ford Coppola, such as attending film festivals, though she denied the film was autobiographical. Coppola said that cultural depictions of fame are unbalanced, and at a time when so many strive for it she is trying to show a different side of it.Keough, Peter. Interview: Sofia Coppola provides direction to Somewhere The Boston Phoenix, January 4, 2011 =Parenthood= Coppola mentioned that the parental angle was inspired by the birth of her second child. As the film progresses the \\"tender and temporary\\" father‚Äìdaughter relationship comes to the fore.Brady, T. Review:Somewhere The Irish Times, December 10, 2010 Marco has partial custody of his daughter from a failed marriage. Ebert speculates that she probably understands the reasons for the split better than he, and wonders why the child must suffer his hedonism and \\"detached attempts at fatherhood\\". In some ways Cleo‚Äîhaving grown up inside the Hollywood bubble‚Äîmothers her father, cooking for him and being more worldly aware, but she also watches him with the wide-eyed adoration of a child. =Comedy of show-business= Coppola comes from a family of film- makers and actors, and she has said how childhood memories of living in hotels partially inspired her choice of setting. Somewhere presents a detailed portrait of life in that industry and charts its existential and emotional boundaries. While celebrity gossip websites inform us of the shallowness of much of \\"star life\\", Coppola's feature differs in its emotional depth. She wanted to depict Marco working, but not on a film set. Instead he is shown giving interviews, being photographed, attending an awards ceremony in Italy, and having special effects make-up applied. When Marco attends the special- effects department his face is covered in latex, the camera then very slowly, hypnotically zooms in.French, P. Somewhere-review December 12, 2010, The Observer Marco is obliged to use his \\"star\\" recognition to help promote his new film, when his publicist calls he becomes passive and mechanically takes the arranged chauffeured car and speaks to the press. In part, the humor derives from Marco's subdued response to these attentions, and Coppola's off- beat observation of people around him.McNab, G. First Night: Somewhere, Venice Film Festival The Independent, (London:September 4, 2010) At the Venice film festival, critics highlighted the repetition of characters in a cloistered existence in Coppola's films, to which she responded \\"I feel like everyone should tell what they know in the world that they know\\".Lim, Dennis It's What She Knows: The Luxe Life The New York Times, December 10, 2010 Legacy In 2019, Somewhere was included in Richard Brody's list of the 27 best films of the decade.

Including a German-language special edition for the 1987 centennial of Esperanto, 165 issues were published (many of which appeared as double numbers spanning two months) with a total of 3,728 pages over the entire print run.

They were purchased and intended for operation by the Canadian Forces Primary Reserve, but were rapidly appropriated by the regular force of the Canadian Army. The Bison is part of the Light Armoured Vehicle family with the Coyote Reconnaissance Vehicle and the Australian ASLAV produced by General Dynamics Land Systems - Canada and based on the MOWAG Piranha 8x8. Design By starting with a basic LAV-25, the Bison design process took only 7 days. The Bison differs from the baseline LAV-25 by raising the height of the roof, removing the turret ring, placing a commander's cupola behind the driver, and incorporating a rail mount system in the cargo/passenger compartment to quickly change mission specific equipment. The driver is seated in the front- left of the crew compartment. The commander has a slightly raised position directly behind the driver with access to his own hatch and mounted machine gun. The engine is to the right of the crew compartment. The Canadian Forces began upgrading the Bison between 2002 and 2008. The upgrades include improved engine power, new torsion bars, fittings for add-on armour, air conditioning, and the VRS respirator system for NBC defence. Variants The Bison's rail mount system allows it to be adapted to a variety of roles without any major modifications. Bisons used by the Canadian Forces have been adapted for use as armoured personnel carriers (original configuration - mostly replaced in this role by the LAV III), 81mm mortar carriers, ambulances (32), Mobile Repair Team (MRT) vehicles (32), Armoured recovery vehicles (32), electronic warfare vehicles (25), and NBC reconnaissance vehicles (4).

S√°mi schools are part of the Swedish public school system, and as such are governed by the same curriculum that primary schools are. S√°mi schools are state-owned educational institutions that are open to all children whose parents claim to be S√°mi. Each school has its own dormitory that many students live in for large parts of the academic year due to the long distances in the north of Sweden. Teaching took place in both Swedish and S√°mi, which was also taught separately. The S√°mi schools have a small number of students. The schools are located in Karesuando, Lannavaara, Kiruna, G√§llivare and Jokkmokk in Norrbotten County and in T√§rnaby in V√§sterbotten County. Grades 1-6 are taught everywhere but G√§llivare, where only grades 7-9 are taught. Some municipalities in Lapland do not have their own S√°mi school, so they have integrated S√°mi teaching at the primary school level and native- language education in S√°mi when it can be arranged. The Sami Education Board () in Jokkmokk has been responsible for the S√°mi schools since 1981. Board members, who are S√°mi themselves, are appointed by the Sami Parliament of Sweden. An ordinance on nomad schools was passed in Sweden in 1913. This type of school ran parallel to the primary school form prevalent at the time called folkskola. While the number of days in the academic year was the same as for the folkskola, the academic year itself was adapted to conform to the everyday life that the S√°mi led at the time. During the 1940s and 1950s, the school goahti that were in use were replaced with a western-style dormitory. Up until the 1950s, nomad schools could either be mobile or be in a fixed location. After that decade, however, the mobile versions were discontinued. History=S√°mi boys sent to Uppsala= The latter six had been sent to the bailiff in Tornio to be transported over the water. The other ten were to be accompanied by Hjort himself, but one fell ill and had to be left behind. So there were only nine boys left that Daniel Thordsson Hjort led. When they arrived in Gnarp in H√§lsingland, however, the two oldest boys ran away while a violent storm raged. Hjort had the entire parish out looking for them, but they were not able to find the two boys. The remaining seven boys were delivered to the bailiff in G√§vle, where they were given Western-style clothing and shoes before they were finally settled in Uppsala. It would be Christoffer von Warnstedt, governor of Uppsala Castle, who would be ultimately responsible for their upkeep. No one knows how the seven S√°mi boys at Uppsala fared. According to an announcement from 1612, however, it transpired that the students received no compensation for their studies during the three years there were at Uppsala. =The Pite√• Lapp school= In 1617, Nicolaus Andre√¶, the vicar in Pite√•, offered to found a school for the S√°mi. This idea was supported by King Gustav II Adolf. Andre√¶ was from a birkarl family and knew some S√°mi. Each year, six boys would be educated at the newly founded Lapp school in the hopes that some of them would eventually become priests and start working with the mission in Lappmarken. In 1619, Andre√¶ published a liturgy book and primer in S√°mi; these were the first books to be published in the language. When Andre√¶ died in 1628, the school only had three students, who stayed on to be taught by his successor, Johannes Hossius. In 1632, they transferred to the newly founded Skyttean school in Lycksele. =The Skyttean school in Lycksele= After Andre√¶'s death, no other priest was available who knew S√°mi. As the priests lived on the coast and only made the trip up to Lappmarken a couple of times a year, they had to preach to the masses through an interpreter. The dean in Ume√•, Olaus Petri Niurenius, saw that this was a problem and discussed the matter with person councillor () Johan Skytte. This resulted in a new Lapp school, the Skyttean school, being set up in Lycksele with Johan Skytte providing backing for it. The school seemed to be open already in February 1632 with two former students from the Lapp school in Pite√• having joined its staff as teachers. In April, Niurenius announced that the school had eleven students. One of the main objectives was to supply academically gifted boys for the seminary, so that they could then return to work amongst their own people. In 1633, the post of S√°mi catechist was established at the Skyttean school. This resulted in the majority of teaching taking place in Swedish. The first student from the Skyttean school that was actually ordained as a priest was Olaus Stephani Graan, who became head of his old school in 1657. He wrote two books that would go on to have a major impact on the school‚Äôs program: Cathechetiska fr√•gor, tryckte 1688 until Lapparnes undervisning, as well as an updated edition of the Manuale Lapponicum, containing Psalms and Ecclesiastes from the Old Testament, a Catechism, a psalter, and a lectionary ‚Äì all in S√°mi. S√°mi students at Uppsala By 1725, a total of 14 students with a S√°mi background had enrolled at the University of Uppsala. The majority of these students came from the Skyttean school in Lycksele, but some of them also had ties leading back to Andre√¶ in Pite√•. The 14 students and the year each one enrolled at the university are as follows: *1633: Andreas Petri Lappo (pastor in Arvidsjaur 1640‚Äì1649. After that, he became priest at the mine at Nasafj√§ll, and then finally in Jokkmokk.) *1635: Paulus Matthiae Lappo *1636: Jacobus Matthiae Lappo Gr√•treschensis (very likely the brother of Paulus Matthiae Lappo; attended school in Pite√• and went on to become the head of the Skyttean school) *1660: Nicholaus Haquini Vindelius Lapponius *1662: Hindrichus Svenonius Lyckselius (became the first assistant vicar in Sorsele) *1662: Nicholaus Olai Vindelius Lappo *1672: Olaus Matthiae Lappo Sirma (did not attend the Skyttean school; attended a primary school in Torne√•; became a priest in Karesuando) *1674: Nicolaus Andreae Lundius Lappo (son of Andreas Petri) *1676: Nicolaus Jonae Spolander Lappo *1688: Laurentius Rangius Lappo (successor to Henrik Svenonius in Sorsele) *1706: Sivardus Granbergh *1710: Kenicius Granlund Lappo *1720: Zimeon Zachariae Granmark Lappo *1722: Petrus Thurenius At the same time, there were S√°mi students at other institutes of higher education such as H√§rn√∂sands gymnasium, which is, for example, where Olaus Stephani Graan studied. =Additional Lapp schools established= The royal decree of 1723 \\"Lappl√§ndarnes flitigare undervisning i kristendomen and skolars inr√§ttande d√§r i orten\\" stated that Lapp schools were to be established at each and every one of the seven main churches in Lappland. This resulted in schools being set up at Jokkmokk and √Ösele in 1732, Arjeplog in 1743, Jukkasj√§rvi in 1744, F√∂llinge in 1748, G√§llivare in 1756 and Enonteki√∂ in 1813. As with the Skyttean school, which still existed, these were small schools that usually had six pupils whom the Crown provided upkeep for. The idea was that after two years in the Lapp school students would be able to start teaching other children back home. This new decree changed the character of the Lapp schools. The new schools lacked the academic emphasis that the Skyttean school had had. Instead, these schools were two-year boarding schools at the primary level where schoolchildren were taught reading and Christianity. These schools existed until 1820. During the last year of their existence, √Ösele, Lycksele, Arjeplog, Jokkmokk and G√§llivare had a ‚Äùfull school‚Äù, i.e., six students and Jukkasj√§rvi and Karesuando had ‚Äùhalf‚Äù schools with three students each. As the number of pupils in the Lapp schools was so limited, catechists were used to supplement their education. Any S√°mi whose children were not attending the school, but were otherwise interested, could request a catechist from their pastor. The catechist taught the family's children at home and could even spend an entire winter with one family. The Lapp schools in √Ösele, Arjeplog, Jukkasj√§rvi and Karesuando were closed in 1820, replaced by a new, mobile form of teaching. By this point in time, catechists were responsible for teaching the entire curriculum to an entire siida or some other larger group of S√°mi.

PAN occurs when the specific gravity of the membrane space of the semicircular canals in the ear differs from the specific gravity of the fluid in the canals because of the presence of alcohol. PAN I When a person consumes alcohol, the alcohol is carried by the bloodstream and diffused into the water compartments of the body. Normally, the specific gravity of a canal membrane is the same as the specific gravity of the surrounding fluid. Because of this, even though the Earth's gravity is a constant force of acceleration, the semicircular canals do not respond to it. Alcohol has a lighter specific gravity than water. When alcohol enters the canal membrane via capillaries, the specific gravity of the membrane is lower than that of the surrounding fluid. The alcohol does diffuse from the membrane to the fluid, but it does so very slowly. While the specific gravity of the membrane is lower than the specific gravity of the extracellular fluid, the hair cells on the membrane become responsive to the Earth's gravity. This is the condition of PAN I. PAN I is characterized by a nystagmus to the right when the right side of the head is down. It is typically present during a rising and peak Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC).  PAN II  As soon as a person starts drinking, the body begins to process and eliminate the alcohol. The rate of elimination is fairly constant. Initially, the rate of absorption exceeds the rate of elimination, which results in a rising BAC. Some time after a person stops drinking, the rate of absorption drops below the rate of elimination, and the BAC begins falling. As alcohol is eliminated from the body, it is removed from the membrane of the semicircular canal faster than the surrounding fluid. This creates the reverse situation of PAN I, as the specific gravity of the fluid is now lower than that of the membrane. This results in PAN II. PAN II is characterized by a nystagmus to the right when the left side of the head is down. Relationship between PAN and the effects of intoxication The overstimulation of the semicircular canals during PAN I and PAN II is associated with the unsteadiness, nausea, and vertigo felt by intoxicated people. PAN I is more associated with postural problems (e.g. standing and walking) while PAN II has been more associated with the feelings of a hangover. There is a brief period between PAN I and PAN II when the alcohol concentrations in the canal membrane and extracellular fluid are in equilibrium. During this time, neither PAN I nor PAN II is present.  PAN versus testing for HGN in intoxicated individuals  Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) testing is a common practice used by law enforcement in the United States in the identification of persons who are intoxicated or under the influence of a controlled substance. The key difference between recognizing PAN and horizontal gaze nystagmus is the position of the subject's head in relation to the body. PAN is identified when the head is tilted to one side or the other. In order for HGN to be properly identified, the head must be positioned in line with the spine. Because of this, if the head is tilted towards the side when an evaluation for HGN is given, PAN may be induced and give a \\"false positive\\" for HGN. Some defendants may claim or argue that the nystagmus observed by an officer was positional and not horizontal gaze.Advanced DUI Investigation: A Training and Reference Manual, Daniel J.

The history of the London School of Economics dates from 1895, when the School was founded by Fabian Society members Sidney and Beatrice Webb, Graham Wallas, and George Bernard Shaw, with funding provided by private philanthropy, including a bequest of ¬£20,000 from Henry Hunt Hutchinson to the Fabian Society. Foundation and early history Supposedly the decision to found the school was made at a breakfast party on 4 August 1894. All believed in advancing socialist causes by reformist rather than revolutionary means, and the LSE was established to further the Fabian aim of bettering society, focusing on research on issues of poverty, inequality and related issues. This led the Fabians, and the LSE, to be one of the main influences on the UK Labour Party.A piece of Fabian history unveiled at LSE The School was founded with the initial intention of renewing the training of Britain's political and business elite, which seemed to be faltering due to inadequate teaching and research - the number of postgraduate students was dwarfed by those in other countries. A year before the founding, the British Association for the Advancement of Science pushed for the need to advance the systematic study of social sciences as well. In fact, Sidney and Beatrice Webb used the curriculum of the Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris (best known as \\"Sciences Po\\"), which covered the full range of the social sciences, as part of their inspiration for moulding the LSE's educational purpose. LSE was opened in October 1895 at No. 9 John Street, Adelphi, originally as a night school to bring higher education to the working classes. The LSE's arms appear above the main entrance to the Old Building, which opened in 1922. The School expanded rapidly and was moved along with its newly established library, the British Library of Political and Economic Science to No. 10 Adelphi Terrace in September 1896, continuing to expand through the next couple of years thanks to Shaw. In 1902, The Coefficients dining club was regularly meeting in the Library, and they affected the development of LSE along with the Fabians and the Suffragettes movement (who also first met at LSE). In 1900, the School became officially recognised as a Faculty of Economics within the much larger University of London in Bloomsbury, and began enrolling students for bachelor's degrees and doctorates in the same year. At the same time, the LSE began expanding into other areas of social sciences, including, initially, geography (in 1902) and philosophy (in 1903), pioneering the study of international relations, as well as teaching history, law, psychology and sociology. By 1902, it was apparent the School had and would continue to outgrow its Adelphi Terrace location, and moved to its present campus in Clare Market off the Aldwych and aside Kingsway - not far from Whitehall, in 1902. The Old Building, which remains a significant office and classroom building, was opened on Houghton Street in 1922. William Beveridge was LSE Director from 1919 until 1937. During these years and under the directorship of William Beveridge, future father of the welfare state and the National Health Service, LSE redefined the study of economics and the new conception of the study of economics as \\"a science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses\\" is looked to as the norm. LSE in this sense must be looked at as the father of modern economics studies. Under Beveridge, Friedrich Hayek was appointed as a professor and he brought about the ascendancy of the LSE through his famous debates with John Maynard Keynes. In 1939, with the outbreak of the Second World War, LSE's Houghton Street campus became home to the Ministry for Economic Warfare, whilst following discussions between school Director, Carr-Saunders and Winston Churchill, it was agreed to temporarily relocate the school to Cambridge, where it took over Peterhouse. Initially for a period of a year, the beginning of the Blitz led to LSE's post at Cambridge to be lengthened, returning to London in 1945. The famed Keynes-Hayek debates which occurred between Cambridge and the LSE still shapes the two major schools of economic thought today as nations still debate the merits of the welfare state versus an economy solely controlled by the market.\\"Fear the Boom and Bust\\" a Hayek vs. Keynes Rap Anthem LSE's influence upon modern economics is undeniable since it both formed the very basis for economic thought as well as shaped modern perception of free market economics. Hayek's works continue to influence the study of economics across the globe. At the other extreme, during these years Harold Joseph Laski, a professor of political science at the LSE was influential in British politics as an advocate of far left policies. Many renowned world leaders including John F. Kennedy (and his brother Robert F. Kennedy) studied under his guidance at the LSE. Recent history Sociologist Anthony Giddens is a recent former Director of the LSE, and a key proponent of third way politics. While the LSE's initial reputation was that of a socialist-leaning institution, this had changed by the 1960s, with LSE Director Walter Adams fighting hard to remove LSE from its Fabian roots. This led to many student protests, which also involved Lionel Robbins, who had returned to LSE as chairman of governors, having been a member of staff for many years. Anthony Giddens, the former Director of the LSE, stands as the creator of the \\"Third Way\\" followed by both Tony Blair (who unveiled the Fabian Window at LSE in 2005) and Bill Clinton. His policy created a balance between the traditional welfare state and the belief in total free market economics. This policy is being put into effect by governments all across the world as free market economies continue to deal with wealth inequalities and bettering the welfare of the general population. In 2002, it was reported that the school had applied to the Privy Council for the power to award its own degrees. Degree-awarding powers being granted, the LSE continued to award University of London degrees until February 2007, when the LSE's Director, Sir Howard Davies, announced that the school had sought permission from the University to award degrees in its own name. All students who registered with the school since the beginning of the academic year 2007/08 are now awarded LSE degrees. =Libya links= On 4 March 2011, LSE's Director Howard Davies resigned over allegations that the LSE had accepted donations from the Libyan government in return for favourable treatment.

Ernst Ludwig Heim (22 July 1747 ‚Äì 15 September 1834) was a German physician and naturalist born in Solz, Thuringia. He was popular for providing free medical treatment in Berlin. As a naturalist Heim influenced Alexander von Humboldt and Christian Konrad Sprengel.  Early life  Heim was the son of pastor Johann Ludwig Heim (1704‚Äì1785). He went to Halle to study in 1766 and received his doctorate in 1772. He studied medicine, botany, astronomy, natural law and philosophy. He then served as Stadtphysikus (government physician) in Spandau (1776). He travelled across the Netherlands, France and England and visited hospitals and examined public health. Heim married Charlotte Maeker in 1780 and in April 1783 they moved to Berlin with their young daughter and lived at the Gendarmenmarkt. He opened a practice in Markgrafenstra√üe where he had a system of treating poor patients for free in the early morning. In 1799 he introduced smallpox vaccination in Berlin using cowpox inoculation based on Edward Jenner's work. He was an expert in the diagnosis of diseases and introduced novel methods including using colour and smell to identify diseases. In 1822, in recognition of decades of altruistic service, and on the 50th anniversary of earning his doctorate, Heim was made an honorary citizen of Berlin. In Germany, numerous landmarks bear his name, and he is commemorated on a 1984 postage stamp. In addition, over sixteen biographies on Heim have been published. 165x165px Heim was the physician who tried to treat Luise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (Queen Luise of Prussia) but failed to prevent her death. He was for a period of time was a teacher to 8-year old Alexander von Humboldt in Tegel. He visited on horseback and gave instructions in botany, explaining the twenty-four Linnean classes. They also went out on botanical excursions with Carl Sigismund Kunth. He also influenced the Christian Konrad Sprengel who came to him for treatment. Sprengel took to botany thanks to Heim's suggestion that he needed to spend more time outdoors. The plant genus Heimia is named in his honor. Grave of Heim () Heim died on 15 September 1834 in his bed and Berliners escorted the carriage of his body to the cemetery at Halleschen gate in large numbers.

The atrocity occurred across from the mouth of the Yellow Creek on the upper Ohio River in the Ohio Country, near the current site of the Mountaineer Casino, Racetrack and Resort. It was the single most important incident contributing to the outbreak of Lord Dunmore's War (May-October 1774). It was carried out by a group led by Jacob Greathouse and Daniel Greathouse. The perpetrators were never brought to justice. This incident was all the worse because Mingo leader Logan was a good friend of the English-speaking settlers in the region. Chief Logan was away on a hunt but his wife Mellana, his brother Taylaynee (called John Petty by many English speakers), Taylaynee's son Molnah and their sister Koonay were among the slain. Koonay was also the wife of John Gibson , a prominent trader between the English and various Native American groups. At the time of the massacre, these groups were on a trading expedition to the Shawnee. The Greathouse group lured the Mingo group under Taylaynee into their camp with a promise of liquor and sport. Then they sprung an ambush on the Mingos and shot them dead. After the killings many of the bodies were mutilated. In a particularly brutal killing, Jacob Greathouse ripped open Koonay's abdomen and removed and scalped her unborn son. The only member of the first group who was not killed was Koonay's two-year-old daughter who was eventually returned to the care of her father, John Gibson, after she had for a time been in the care of William Crawford. Daniel Greathouse died of measles in 1775. Jacob Greathouse was killed in the ambush of William Foreman Company in September 1777. It was Jonathan Greathouse who was killed 1791 while moving his family west. They were abducted by Native Americans on the Ohio River.

Background He was the second son of Richard Newport, 1st Baron Newport and his wife Rachel, daughter of Sir John Leveson. His older brother was Francis Newport, 1st Earl of Bradford., and baptised at High Ercall, Shropshire.Article by C.H. Firth, revised by Sean Kelsey He was educated at a school in Wroxeter, and Christ Church, Oxford. Like his father and brother, Newport was an active supporter of King Charles II of England during the English Civil War. After the Penruddock uprising in 1655 and the failed pro- Royalist military activities of Sir George Booth, 2nd Baronet in 1659, he was arrested each time and imprisoned. Following the English Restoration, he was nominated for a proposed Order of the Royal Oak and an estate worth ¬£800 a year was settled on him, with his principal lands being at Deythur, near Llandrinio, Montgomeryshire.http://www/histparl.ac.uk/volume/1690-1715/member/newport-hon- andrew-1622-99 Career In 1660, following the English Restoration, Newport was called to the court as Esquire of the Body. From 1667 to 1681 he served as comptroller of the Great Wardrobe and was subsequently nominated a Commissioner of Customs in 1681, an office he held until 1685. Newport entered the English House of Commons in a by-election in 1661, sitting for Montgomeryshire until 1679. He was returned for Preston from 1685 until 1689 and then for Shrewsbury until 1698. Militarily, Newport held commission as Captain of a company of foot on the Portsmouth garrison from 1662 to 1673. Newport was a Custos Rotulorum of Montgomeryshire between January and December 1679. He was again appointed in 1685, until 1687 and exercised this post a third time from 1691 until his death eight years later. Newport represented the county also as Justice of the Peace and was Commissioner for Assessment of Salop and Montgomeryshire several times. Newport was one of a number of men unsuccessfully implicated by Jacobite conspirator Sir John Fenwick when prosecuted in 1695 prior to the latter's eventual execution in 1697, the allegation being that while Newport was absent from London he allowed his home in Berkeley Street to be used for meetings by two Jacobite noblemen. Death Newport died unmarried and childless, at Eyton-on-Severn, Shropshire, the home of his nephew, Lord Newport, aged 76, and was buried in the chancel at nearby Wroxeter church. He left his estates and a ¬£40,000 fortune to his younger nephew Thomas Newport. Literary Reference He has been speculatively identified with the Andrew Newport who nominally wrote Memoirs of a Cavalier, (published 1720), a supposedly factual but possibly fictional account of experiences in the Thirty Years' War and Royalist campaigns in England by a Shropshire-born soldier. It was published by Daniel Defoe, strongly suspected to be the real author, over 20 years after the death of this Andrew Newport, who was only ten years old in the year the account begins (1632). Although of age (twenty in 1642) to have served in the English Civil War, there is doubt in absence of record that Newport did and he appears in no list of royalists fined by parliament for delinquency, unlike his father and elder brother.

Medical education agencies are divided into two categories:  CME  Medical education agencies that develop Continuing medical education (most commonly referred to as CME) programs in the United States, do so within the strict guidelines set forth by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education (SACME). Those who wish to offer CME courses, and thus employ the services of a medical education agency, must receive accreditation from the ACCME. Accreditation allows organizations, such as the American Nursing Certification Center (ANCC) to develop educational course content that physicians and other professional medical staff may use to satisfy annual CME requirements. To avoid the risk of undue bias from commercial sponsorship, all accredited organizations must follow the commercial disclosure rules set out by the ACCME. Medical education agencies must familiarize themselves with these regulations in order to receive CME accreditation from one or more ACCME accredited organizations.  Non-CME  Medical education agencies that develop Non-CME, also referred to as Promotional education, programs specialize in developing content whose commercial sponsorship is clearly outlined, and course content focuses on specific products or therapies in which the sponsoring organization has a financial interest.  Delivery Mechanisms  The majority of content developed by medical education agencies supports one of two types of delivery mechanism: Instructor Led Training (ILT) and Self Directed Training (SDT). = Instructor Led Training = Instructor led training, ILT, is the practice of face-to-face delivery of information and learning material between an instructor and learners.

Herrnstadt actively provided intelligence about Nazi Germany and Poland to the Soviet Union in the 1930s. Biography Herrnstadt was born in the Upper Silesian city of Gleiwitz (now Gliwice, Poland), where his father was employed as a lawyer. He began studying law in Heidelberg in 1922, but moved towards writing instead, becoming a journalist for the left-wing Berliner Tageblatt in 1929. He began working for the newspaper in 1925 as a typesetter. He joined the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1929, fleeing the country in 1933, when the arrival of Adolf Hitler at the seat of power made Herrnstadt a target, both as an unrepentant communist activist and as a Jew. =Abroad= Herrnstadt came to work for Soviet intelligence in the 1930s and spent most of the decade in Warsaw. With the invasion of Poland by the Nazi military in 1939, Herrnstadt fled to the Soviet Union and came to reside in Moscow, where he applied and was accepted into the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.Grieder, Peter.

Herrnstadt was among the domestic critics of Ulbricht's line of the SED as a leading politician with candidate member status in the SED's Politburo and chief editor of the Neues Deutschland; a key ally during this time was Wilhelm Zaisser, who criticized Ulbricht from his position as the country's Minister of State Security and a leading party ideologist. However, Herrnstadt's dissension against the course of the Ulbricht faction was also criticized by Soviet adviser Vladimir Semyonov, who answered Herrnstadt's attack by replying that \\"in two weeks you may no longer have a state.\\"Maier, Charles S.

Because of its importance to the history of Bend, the Smith Pioneer Hardware Store is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Nichols Smith  At the age of 34, Nichols Paul Smith came to Central Oregon to help survey the Bend town site for Alexander M. Drake, owner of the Pilot Butte Development Company. Smith worked as a surveyor and carpenter, helping to establish the Bend community. He built a house near the Deschutes River in the area that is now the Drake Park Neighborhood Historic District. In 1903, Smith and his wife, Cora Bell, opened a hardware store on the east side of Wall Street near the center of downtown Bend. with In 1909, Smith built a new store across the street from his original location with an apartment upstairs so he could be close to his business. Smith's new store sold a wide range of household goods including stoves and butter churns. He also sold building materials, farm equipment, and hunting and fishing supplies.

In addition to being a successful businessman, Smith was also active in civic affairs and politics. He was a member of Bend's volunteer fire department. He also supervised the construction of the city's downtown sidewalks. Smith was the local chairman of the Democratic Party and served on the election board for many years as well a bailiff for the Deschutes County Court.  Building history  The N. P. Smith Pioneer Hardware Store and adjoining warehouse were built by Nichols P. Smith in June 1909, just four years after the city of Bend was founded. The building originally housed a hardware store on the ground floor with second floor apartment where Smith and his family lived. The structure was typical of the commercial building being constructed in Bend in the early 20th century, simple and functional. The hardware store remained in business until 1930. Since then several other businesses have occupied the building. Smith's daughter, Marjorie Smith, was still living in the upstairs apartment in the 1980s.\\"Significant Designers, Contractors & Trades People\\" , Deschutes County Landmarks, Deschutes County, Bend, Oregon, 17 January 2001. In 1983, the building's street front exterior was renovated and restored. The aluminum and plywood siding that had been installed over the years was removed, revealing the original fa√ßade still in excellent condition. Window sills, corner boards, and the cornice molding were replaced. Then the original horizontal lap siding and restored board trim were repainted in their original colors. The N. P. Smith Pioneer Hardware Store is an excellent example of a commercial building from Bend's earliest period of development. It was among the city's first retail stores. Today, it is the oldest wood-frame structure that still exists in downtown Bend. Because of its importance to Bend history, the N. P. Smith Pioneer Hardware Store was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on 5 April 1984.\\"Smith, N.P., Pioneer Hardware Store\\", National Register of Historic Places, www.nationalregisterofhistoricalplaces.com, 12 July 2009.\\"Smith, N P, Pioneer Hardware Store\\", Oregon Historic Site Database, State Historic Preservation Office, State of Oregon, Salem, Oregon, 19 July 2009.  Structure  The Smith Pioneer Hardware Store is located on the west side of Wall Street between Oregon Avenue and Minnesota Avenue in downtown Bend. It is a two-story wood-frame building with a footprint of 20 feet by 75 feet with an adjoining 20 foot by 70 foot warehouse in the back. The combined structure occupies a 25 by 150 foot city lot. There is a newer brick structure abutting the store's external wall on the north side. On the south side of the building, there is a narrow walkway between the store and the neighboring brick structure. It provides access to an open stairway that leads to the second floor apartment. The back of the warehouse opens on to an alleyway called Brooks Street. The Smith store is a good example of the western false front type commercial structure. These simple commercial buildings were typically two stories with a vertical facade and square top. A gabled-roof structure was often hidden behind the false front. Like Smith, many owners ran a store or other business on the ground floor and live upstairs. There were many false front buildings constructed in the Bend area between 1900 and 1910. However, the Smith hardware store is the only surviving example in downtown Bend.\\"Western False Front, Deschutes County Landmarks, Deschutes County, Bend, Oregon, 19 July 2009. Originally, the store front was faced with six inch horizontal lap siding, trimmed at the corners with 1-by-6 vertical wooden molding. The entrance to the store is through recessed double doors in the center of the building. However, the double doors have been replaced by a single glass door with full-length windows on either side. The entrance is flanked by two large display windows, each with four window panes. On the second floor, there are two separate double-hung casement windows overlooking the street. The fa√ßade was originally capped with a wooden cornice that extends 20 inches out from the building's face, but it was eventually replaced by a molded stucco cornice. The building has a flat roof that slope gently toward the rear of the structure.  Interior  In the Smith building, the ground floor is commercial space, originally housing a hardware store. Inside, the walls are finished with two-inch tongue-and-groove paneling. The flooring is 1-by-4 tongue-and-groove planking. Originally, there were built-in shelves along the full length of one wall. The original light fixtures had glass shades and were suspended from the ceiling by drop-cords. The door knobs, locks, and other hardware were brass. Over the years, the original tongue-and-groove ceiling was covered by a suspended acoustic tile ceiling and fluorescent lights have been installed using the original drop-cords. The original shelves have been replaced by new shelving that now runs along both sidewalls, and the floor is now carpeted. The owner's apartment upstairs includes a living room, dining room, kitchen, and two bedrooms. The walls and floor were finished with the same tongue-and-groove paneling and planking as downstairs. However, the walls have been covered by wallpaper in the bedrooms and plasterboard in the other rooms and the floors have been carpeted. The woodwork includes eight-inch baseboard molding and four-inch framing around the doors and windows. The kitchen has built-in cabinets. There are ventilation transoms above some interior doors. Like the ground floor, the light fixtures have glass shades and are suspended from the ceiling by drop-cords and the door hardware is brass. There was originally a large open porch on the second floor adjacent to the living area. Around 1915, the porch was enclosed and turned into additional living space. That alteration added a third bedroom, a family room, a bathroom, and some interior storage space to the apartment.

The system was first noted as a depression on 4 May 1990, while it was located over the Bay of Bengal about to the southeast of Chennai, India. During the next day the depression intensified into a cyclonic storm and started to intensify rapidly, becoming a super cyclonic storm early on 8 May. The cyclone weakened slightly before it made landfall on India about 300 km (190 mi) to the north of Madras in the Andhra Pradesh state as a very severe cyclonic storm with winds of 165 km/h (105 mph). While over land the cyclone gradually dissipated. The cyclone had a severe impact on India, with over 967 people reported to have been killed. Over 100,000 animals also died in the cyclone with the total cost of damages to crops estimated at over $ (1990 USD). Meteorological history On 4 May 1990, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) reported that a depression had developed over the Bay of Bengal about to the southeast of Chennai, India. During that day the system gradually developed further and became the subject of a tropical cyclone formation alert, by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center as it moved westwards under the influence of the subtropical ridge of high pressure. The depression subsequently intensified into a cyclonic storm early the next day, before the JTWC initiated advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 02B later that day. At this stage the JTWC only expected the cyclone to intensify marginally, before it weakened as it made landfall in Southern India within 72 hours. During 6 May, the system started to move more towards the north-west because of a weakness in the subtropical ridge, as it continued to intensify and became a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm. This turn towards the northwest turned out to be more northerly than had been expected, which as a result allowed the system to stay offshore for longer than had been expected by the JTWC. Over the next couple of days the system rapidly intensified before the JTWC reported early on 8 May, that the system had peaked with 1-minute sustained windspeeds of 230 km/h (145 mph), which made the system equivalent to a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. At around the same time the IMD also reported that the cyclone had peaked as a Super Cyclonic Storm, with 3-minute sustained wind speeds of 235 km/h (145 mph) and an estimated central pressure of . By this time the system was located about to the northeast of Madras and was moving northwards slowly. Later that day as the ship Visvamohini moved through the systems eye region, it measured a central pressure of , which the IMD reported would be one of the lowest central pressures ever measured in the Bay of Bengal if it was correct. The system subsequently started to weaken and had become a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm by the time it made landfall during 9 May, near the mouth of the Krishna River in southern Andhra Pradesh. The system subsequently moved north-westwards and gradually weakened further, before it was last noted during 11 May, by both the IMD and JTWC. Preparations and impact=Preparations= As a result of timely warnings issued by the IMD, the Indian government was able to launch an evacuation campaign and order that all fisherman return to shore. This led to more than 150,000 people being evacuated to relief camps which had been set up on higher ground. Due to the thorough preparations, there was fewer deaths than in the 1977 Andhra Pradesh cyclone. =Impact= On Edurumondi Island over 7,000 people were left stranded after they refused to evacuate. The island itself was reported to have experienced the full brunt of the system. However, all of the residents reportedly sought protection within a shelter provided by the government. The cyclone had a significant effect on India, with storm surge tides as high as 4.9 meters (16 ft) above normal. Consequently, over 100 villages were submerged in water and destroyed. At least 967 people were killed by the cyclone; most of the deaths occurred when houses made mostly out of mud and straw collapsed. Other people were killed when electrical wires were knocked down and while some people were carried away by flooded rivers. The storm left at least 3 million people homeless, while over 100,000 farm animals were killed. At least of rice paddies were destroyed along with huge tracts of mango and banana trees. The total damage to crops and property was estimated at over $ (1990 USD). The cyclone was described as the worst disaster in southern India since the 1977 storm. Sea water contaminated fresh drinking wells, prompting warnings about outbreaks of Cholera and Typhoid as many people were drinking and cooking with water from the drains which was causing stomach disorders. Tamil Nadu Overall the cyclone only caused minor damage to Tamil Nadu with the worst affected area being the district of Chingleput, where one of the old shrines of Kasiviswanather Temple collapsed as high waves hit the coast. A large number of huts were also washed away by the waves, while six deaths were reported in the state. Aftermath On 11 May, two days after the cyclone had hit, the Indian Government launched a massive relief and rescue operation. The Indian Army and Naval helicopters took surveys of areas affected by the cyclone, and also dropped food packets. Although the Indian Government did not request international assistance, the Red Cross provided food, oil, medicines and water tanks for the affected families; the wcc/cicarws issued an appeal for $ (1990 USD) so they could provide immediate needs with World Vision providing $ (1990 USD) for food blankets and utensils.

History Tuckasegee Wesleyan Church (c. 1900) Lake Glenville Powerhouse (1941) an Art Deco-style structure located in Upper Tuckasegee along NC 107 Tuckasegee is located where the East and West forks of the Tuckasegee River come together, rendering it historically flood prone but due to new dams being built on each fork of the river, it is not as flood prone as it was in the past. Wolf, Tanasee Creek, Bear, and Cedar Cliff Lakes are on the East Fork and Glenville Lake on the West Fork. It once boasted two schools, one in Little Canada above it, Canada Elementary, a K-8 School, built in 1952 and closed in 1982, and one in Tuckasegee itself, Tuckasegee School, a combination Elementary and High School, built in the 1940s after a fire consumed the original early 1900s structure, and it closed in 1958. Due to no schools being in the area, students in Little Canada and Upper Tuckasegee are subject to a minimum 45-minute Bus Ride to Cullowhee Valley School in Cullowhee, and car trips to either Sylva or Cullowhee are similar in length. Bear Lake Reserve is an exclusive housing development along Bear Lake in Little Canada. The area has great recreation opportunities for boating, rafting, hiking, and mountain climbing. The community is very against development of the valley, which has been mainly farmland since it was settled in the 1800s. The area once had a couple of Logging Towns, one in the Rock Bridge area of Little Canada and another in East LaPorte. East LaPorte once also boasted its own school, and its much closer to Cullowhee, but hasn't had a school since 1947 and a Post Office since 1955. The logging towns are largely gone, with little trace. Tuckasegee has several historic mountain Churches, including the Tuckasegee Wesleyan Church and the East LaPorte Community Church. The area has a home, the Minnie Stephens Log House, reportedly the first house built by whites in the county.

The packet is approximated by the ensemble of points initially randomly localized within the peek of a Gaussian and moving according to the Newton equations. The ensemble stays localized. For the comparison the second simulation follows when the strength of the circularly polarized electric (rotating) field is equal to zero and the packet (points) fully spreads around the circle. A trojan wave packet is a wave packet that is nonstationary and nonspreading. It is part of an artificially created system that consists of a nucleus and one or more electron wave packets, and that is highly excited under a continuous electromagnetic field. The strong, polarized electromagnetic field, holds or \\"traps\\" each electron wave packet in an intentionally selected orbit (energy shell). They derive their names from the trojan asteroids in the Sun‚ÄìJupiter system. Trojan asteroids orbit around the Sun in Jupiter's orbit at its Lagrangian equilibrium points L4 and L5, where they are phase-locked and protected from collision with each other, and this phenomenon is analogous to the way the wave packet is held together. Concepts and research The concept of the Trojan wave packet is derived from a flourishing area of physics which manipulates atoms and ions at the atomic level creating ion traps. Ion traps allow the manipulation of atoms and are used to create new states of matter including ionic liquids, Wigner crystals and Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensates. This ability to manipulate the quantum properties directly is key to the real life development of applicable nanodevices such as quantum dots and microchip traps. In 2004 it was shown that it is possible to create a trap which is actually a single atom. Within the atom, the behavior of an electron can be manipulated. During experiments in 2004 using lithium atoms in an excited state, researchers were able to localize an electron in a classical orbit for 15,000 orbits (900 ns). It was neither spreading nor dispersing. This \\"classical atom\\" was synthesized by \\"tethering\\" the electron using a microwave field to which its motion is phase locked. The phase lock of the electrons in this unique atomic system is, as mentioned above, analogous to the phase locked asteroids of Jupiter's orbit.Originally published in Science Express on 10 February 2005 The techniques explored in this experiment are a solution to a problem that dates back to 1926. Physicists at that time realized that any initially localized wave packet will inevitably spread around the orbit of the electrons. Physicist noticed that \\"the wave equation is dispersive for the atomic Coulomb potential.\\" In the 1980s several groups of researchers proved this to be true. The wave packets spread all the way around the orbits and coherently interfered with themselves. Recently the real world innovation realized with experiments such as Trojan wave packets, is localizing the wave packets, i.e., with no dispersion. Applying a polarized circular EM field, at microwave frequencies, synchronized with an electron wave packet, intentionally keeps the electron wave packets in a Lagrange type orbit. The Trojan wave packet experiments built on previous work with lithium atoms in an excited state. These are atoms, which respond sensitively to electric and magnetic fields, have decay periods that are relatively prolonged, and electrons, which for all intents and purposes actually operate in classical orbits. The sensitivity to electric and magnetic fields is important because this allows control and response by the polarized microwave field. =Beyond single electron wave packets= rightthumb200pxIn physics, a wave packet is a short \\"burst\\" or \\"envelope\\" of wave action that travels as a unit. A wave packet can be analyzed into, or can be synthesized from, an infinite set of component sinusoidal waves of different wavenumbers, with phases and amplitudes such that they interfere constructively only over a small region of space, and destructively elsewhere. The next logical step is to attempt to move from single electron wave packets to more than one electron wave packet. This had already been accomplished in barium atoms, with two electron wave packets. These two were localized. However, eventually, these created dispersion after colliding near the nucleus. Another technique employed a nondispersive pair of electrons, but one of these had to have a localized orbit close to the nucleus. The nondispersive two-electron Trojan wave packets demonstration changes all that. These are the next step analogue of the one electron Trojan wave packets ‚Äì and designed for excited helium atoms. As of July 2005, atoms with coherent, stable two-electron, nondispersing wave packets had been created. These are excited helium-like atoms, or quantum dot helium (in solid-state applications), and are atomic (quantum) analogues to the three body problem of Newton's classical physics, which includes today's astrophysics. In tandem, circularly polarized electromagnetic and magnetic fields stabilize the two electron configuration in the helium atom or the quantum dot helium (with impurity center). The stability is maintained over a broad spectrum, and because of this, the configuration of two electron wave packets is considered to be truly nondispersive. For example, with the quantum dot helium, configured for confining electrons in two spatial dimensions, there now exists a variety of trojan wave packet configurations with two electrons, and as of 2005, only one in three dimensions. In 2012 an essential experimental step was undertaken not only generating but locking the Trojan wavepackets on adiabatically changed frequency and expanding the atoms as once predicted by Kalinski and Eberly. It will allow to create two electron Langmuir Trojan wave packets in Helium by the sequential excitation in adiabatic Stark field able to produce the circular one-electron aureola over first and then put the second electron in similar state.

He was the first Count of Monz√≥n, probably from before 939, certainly by 943, and he was Count of Castile in 943‚Äì45 in opposition to the deposed Fern√°n Gonz√°lez. His family was known as the Banu Ansur (Banu Anshur) or Ans√∫rez (Assuriz). The earliest reference to Ansur is found in a document dated 4 March 921, wherein he is named with his parents Fernando Ans√∫rez and Muniadonna in a donation in the vicinity of Burgos to San Pedro de Carde√±a.Mart√≠nez, 197. His father is not mentioned after 929, but the date of his death is unknown. The leader of the Banu Ans√∫rez who allied with the Banu G√≥mez in rebellion against Ramiro in favour of his abdicated brother Alfonso IV in the spring of 932 may have already been Ansur. If so, he was already a count by that time.The title count is given to the leader of this rebellion by Ibn Hayyan a century later. According to the Anales castellanos primeros, he participated in the Battle of Simancas in 939, where he is one of only two participating counts named, the other being Fern√°n Gonz√°lez of Castile.\\". . . they [the Saracens] encountered there the king Ramiro and his counts with their armies, that is, Fern√°n Gonz√°lez and Ansur Fern√°ndez and another crowd of squadrons of fighters\\" (invenerunt enim ibidem rex Ranemirus et eius comites qui exierunt cum illo congregati cum suas ostes id est Fredenando Gundesalbiz et Asur Fredenandiz et alia multitudo acmina preliatores), quoted in Mart√≠nez, 380. This indication of his importance and his high rank may also indicate that by then the county of Monz√≥n had already been created by Ramiro II for him. In July 941 Ramiro associated the counts of the Banu Ans√∫rez and G√≥mez families as well as Fern√°n Gonz√°lez and Sancho Garc√©s II of Pamplona with him in a peace treaty signed with the Caliphate of C√≥rdoba.The source, Ibn Hayyan, does not mention Ansur by name, but he was the leader of the Banu Ans√∫rez clan at the time. Despite that Ansur bore the title \\"count\\" as early as 939, the earliest direct reference to the county of Monz√≥n is from a diploma of 26 December 943, which reads regnante Ranimiro in Obeto et in Legione et comite Assur Fredinandiz in Montson (Ramiro reigning in Oviedo and Le√≥n and Count Ansur Fern√°ndez in Monz√≥n). By this act Ansur, his wife Guntroda,Possibly Gontroda N√∫√±ez, daughter of Nu√±o V√©laz. and their children‚ÄîFernando, Oveco, Mu√±o, Nu√±o, Gutierre, Gonzalo, and TeresaOnly five (Fredinando, Obeco, Munnio, Gutier, Gundisalbo) are named in the copy of the charter in the Becerro g√≥tico de Carde√±a (a cartulary), but a fuller list was recorded by Francisco de Berganza in his Antig√ºedades: Fernandus, Oveco, Munio, Nunno, Gutter, Gonzalvo, and Taresa.‚Äîdonated the village of Fuente Adrada near Sacramenia to the monastery of San Pedro de Carde√±a. The gift was confirmed by a \\"Domna Toda\\", who signs right after the king. This may have been Toda of Navarre. A charter dated 1 August 937 refers to Assuri dominans Menduniae (Ansur ruling \\"Mendunia\\", a corruption of Monz√≥n), but there appears to be an error in the dating clause; the correct date is probably 1 March 947.For Ansur's countship in Monz√≥n, cf. Mart√≠nez, 376‚Äì78, and for a map of the County of Monz√≥n, cf. p. 379. After Ramiro deposed Fern√°n Gonz√°lez in Castile, he appointed his own son, the future Sancho I, as count with Ansur acting as his \\"regent\\". By May 944 Sancho was in Burgos. There are four surviving charters from Ansur's brief reign in Castile; the earliest from November 943. The latest is dated to 1 December 945, though according to other sources Fern√°n Gonz√°lez was reinstated in Castile on 22 April that year. Nonetheless, the reinstated Fern√°n signed royal documents below Ansur, indicating a reversal of rank.For Ansur's countship in Castile, cf. P√©rez de Urbel, 493; Keller, 256‚Äì57; and Mart√≠nez, 390‚Äì92. Ansur's only known daughter, Teresa, married Ramiro II's son Sancho I and was the mother of Ramiro III. She inherited, and her son through her, the county of Monz√≥n after the death of Ansur's eldest son and successor, Fernando, in 978. In 976 Fernando boasted that his father had remained always faithful to his monarch and had served him with valour in a thousand battles.San Mart√≠n Payo (1988), 331 and (1993), 204.

It arose through a process of syncretism between the traditional Yoruba religion of West Africa and the Roman Catholic form of Christianity. There is no central authority in control of the movement, which comprises adherents known as creyente and initiates known as santeros (males) and santeras (females). Santer√≠a is polytheistic, involving the veneration of deities known as oricha. These are often identified both as Yoruba gods as well as Roman Catholic saints. Various myths are told about these oricha, which are regarded as subservient to a transcendent creator deity, Olodumare. Each individual is believed to have a specific oricha who has been connected to them since before birth and who informs their personality. Santer√≠a's members usually meet in the homes of santeros or santeras to venerate specific oricha at altars set up for that purpose. A central ritual is the toque de santo, in which practitioners drum, sing, and dance to encourage an oricha to possess one of their members. They believe that through this possessed individual, they can communicate directly with an oricha. Offerings to the oricha include fruit and the blood of sacrificed animals, usually birds. Offerings are also given to the spirits of the dead, especially those of ancestors, with some practitioners identifying as spirit mediums. Several forms of divination are utilized, including If√°, to decipher messages from the oricha. Healing rituals and the preparation of herbal remedies, amulets, and charms, also play a prominent role. Santer√≠a uses the Lucum√≠ language, which is derived from Yoruba, for ritual purposes. Santer√≠a developed among Afro- Cuban communities amid the Atlantic slave trade of the 16th to 19th centuries. It formed through the blending of the traditional religions brought to Cuba by enslaved West Africans, the majority of them Yoruba, and Roman Catholicism, the only religion legally permitted on the island by the Spanish colonial government. After the Cuban War of Independence resulted in a newly independent Cuban state, the constitution enshrined freedom of religion. Santer√≠a nevertheless remained marginalized by the Roman Catholic establishment, which typically viewed it as a type of brujer√≠a (witchcraft) associated with criminality. Concepts from Spiritism increasingly filtered into Santer√≠a from the late 19th century onward. In the 1960s, growing emigration following the Cuban Revolution spread Santer√≠a elsewhere in the Americas. The late 20th century saw growing links between Santer√≠a and related traditions in West Africa and the Americas, such as Haitian Vodou and Brazilian Candombl√©. Since the late 20th century, some practitioners have emphasized a \\"Yorubization\\" process to remove Roman Catholic influences and create forms of Santer√≠a closer to traditional Yoruba religion. Practitioners of Santer√≠a are primarily found in Cuba, although communities elsewhere in the Americas, especially among the Cuban diasporas of Mexico and the United States. Both in Cuba and abroad it has spread beyond its Afro-Cuban origins and is practiced by individuals of various ethnicities. Santer√≠a has faced much opposition and criticism through its history. The Roman Catholic Church has often seen it as Satanic, Cuba's Marxist‚ÄìLeninist government perceived it as primitive superstition, while animal welfare groups have criticised its use of animal sacrifice. Definitions The term \\"Santer√≠a\\" translates into English as the \\"way of the saints.\\" This is the most popular name for the religion, although some practitioners consider it offensive and avoid it in favor of alternatives. Another commonly used term is Regla de Ocha, meaning \\"the rule of ocha\\"; the term \\"ocha\\" is a truncated form of oricha, the word used for the religion's deities. Some adherents regard this as the \\"official\\" name of the religion. In the United States, the tradition has also been referred to as \\"La Religi√≥n Lucum√≠\\", a term originally employed in colonial- era Cuba, and in other instances has been called \\"Regla Lucumi\\", or simply \\"Lucum√≠\\". A figure at the Templo Yemalla, a casa (house of worship) devoted to the oricha Yemaja in Trinidad, Cuba There is no central authority in control of Santer√≠a. A flexible and eclectic tradition, Santer√≠a lacks any strict orthodoxy, and there is considerable variation in how it is practiced. Many of its practitioners also consider themselves to be Roman Catholics, and some adherents have practiced it alongside Hinduism, Spiritism, or have characterised themselves as Jewish. Santer√≠a is an Afro-Cuban religion, and Cuba's government formally classifies it as one of the \\"Cuban religions of African origin\\". In Cuba it is sometimes described as \\"the national religion\\". Many regard it as a uniquely Cuban tradition, although it has spread to other parts of the Americas like Venezuela, Mexico, and the United States. Santer√≠a's roots are in the West African religious systems brought to Cuba by enslaved people, the majority of them Yoruba. There, these beliefs mixed with the Roman Catholicism introduced by Spanish colonialists. Through a process of syncretism, Roman Catholic saints were conflated with West African deities; the Hispanic studies scholars Margarite Fern√°ndez Olmos and Lizabeth Paravisini-Gebert defined Santer√≠a as \\"the veneration of the orishas of the Yoruba pantheon as identified with their corresponding Catholic saints\\". Since the late 19th century, it has also drawn elements from Spiritism. Although Santer√≠a is the best known of the Afro-Cuban religions, as well as being the most popular, it is not the only one. Others include Palo Monte, which derived from practices from the Congo Basin, and Abaku√°, which has its origins among the secret male societies practiced among the Efik-Ibibio. Many of those who practice Palo Monte and Abaku√° also practice Santer√≠a. A fourth Afro-Cuban religion is Arar√°, which derives from practices among the Ewe and Fon; Arar√° is sometimes considered a branch of Santer√≠a rather than a separate system altogether, although unlike most forms of Santer√≠a its origins are not primarily Yoruba. Santer√≠a has commonalities with other West African and West African-derived traditions in the Americas which collectively form the \\"Orisha religion\\"; the anthropologist Paul Christopher Johnson characterized Santer√≠a, Haitian Vodou, and Brazilian Candombl√© as \\"sister religions\\" due to their shared origins in Yoruba traditional belief systems. These common origins can be seen in the fact that Santer√≠a shares much of its theology, including deity names, with Haitian Vodou. Haitian migrants have established a form of Vodou in Cuba, and there are also cases, such as that of the New York-based Mama Lola, in which individuals have been initiated into both Haitian Vodou and Cuban Santer√≠a. Within the religion there is a range of vocabulary to indicate the level of involvement someone has, with the different terms sometimes reflecting different political and social agendas. Practitioners of both Santer√≠a and other Afro-Cuban religions are called creyente (\\"believers\\"). A non-initiate, including those who may attend public Santer√≠a ceremonies, is referred to as an aleyo (\\"stranger\\"); these non-initiates make up the majority of people who participate in the religion. Some people external to the religion have referred to its practitioners as \\"santerians\\" although this is not used by adherents themselves. Those who are initiated are known as santeros if male, and santeras if female, although these two terms have sometimes been used for anyone, initiate or not, who participates in the religion. An alternative term for an initiate is a babalocha or babaloricha (\\"father-deity\\") if male and an iyalocha or iyaloricha (\\"mother-deity\\") if female. Those who have a sustained engagement with the religion are also referred to as omoricha (\\"children of the oricha\\"), or aboricha (\\"one who worships the oricha\\"). An initiate may also be called an oloricha (\\"one who belongs to the oricha\\"). Beliefs=Olodumare and the oricha= Santer√≠a teaches the existence of an overarching divinity, known as Olodumare, Olofl, or Olorun, representing a monotheistic principle in the religion. Practitioners believe that this creator divinity created the universe but takes little interest in human affairs. Olodumare is thus regarded as being inaccessible to humanity. The three facets of this divinity are understood slightly differently; Olodumare represents the divine essence of all that exists, Olorun is regarded as the creator of all beings, while Olofi dwells in all creation. In taking a triplicate form, this creator deity displays similarities with the Christian idea of the Trinity. Santeria is a polytheistic religion. Its deities are referred to as oricha or orisha, or alternatively as the ocha, and also as the santos (\\"saints\\"). The oricha are not gods \\"in the Western sense\\", and thus the educational anthropologist Andr√©s I. P√©rez y Mena thought they were best described as \\"Yoruban ancestor spirits\\". The term oricha can be both singular and plural, because Lucum√≠, the ritual language of Santer√≠a, lacks plural markers for nouns. Practitioners believe that some oricha were created before humanity, but that others were originally humans who became oricha through some remarkable quality. Some practitioners perceive the oricha as facets of Olodumare, and thus think that by venerating them they are ultimately worshipping the creator god. The oricha are not regarded as being wholly benevolent, being capable of both harming and helping humans, and having a mix of emotions, virtues, and vices like humans. The focus of the religion is on creating a reciprocal relationship with them, with adherents believing that oricha can intercede in human affairs and help people if they are appeased. There are various origin myths and other stories about the oricha, known as patak√≠es. Each oricha is understood to \\"rule over\\" a particular aspect of the universe, and have been described as personifications of different facets of the natural world. They are perceived as living in a realm called or√∫n, which is contrasted with ay√©, the realm of humanity. Oricha are identified as each having their own caminos (\\"roads\\"), or different manifestations. This is a concept that several scholars of religion have equated with that of the Hindu concept of avatars. The number of caminos an oricha has can vary, with some regarded as having several hundred. Practitioners believe that oricha can physically inhabit certain objects, among them stones and cowrie shells, which are treated as being sacred. Among the oricha are the four \\"warrior deities\\", or guerrors: Elegu√°, Ogun, Ochosi, and Osun. The first of these, Elegu√°, is viewed as the guardian of the crossroads and thresholds; he is the messenger between humanity and the oricha and most ceremonies start by requesting his permission to continue. He is depicted as being black on one side and red on the other, and although often shown as male is sometimes depicted as being female. Elegu√° is believed to be responsible for reporting on humanity to Olodumare. Practitioners will frequently place a cement head decorated with cowrie shells that represents Elegu√° behind their front door, guarding the threshold to the street. The second guerro is Ogun, viewed as the oricha of weapons and war, and also of iron and blacksmiths. The third, Ochosi, is associated with woods and hunting, while the fourth, Osun, is a protector who warns practitioners when they are in danger. Offerings of coins and a cigar placed before a statue of Saint Lazarus, who represents the oricha Babal√∫ Ay√©, in Havana Another prominent oricha is Yemaja, the deity associated with maternity, fertility, and the sea. Another female divinity, Och√∫n, is the oricha of rivers and of romantic love. Oy√° is a female warrior associated with wind, lightning, and death, and is viewed as the guardian of the cemetery. Chang√≥ or Shango is associated with lightning and fire; he is perhaps the most popular oricha within the pantheon. Obatal√° is the oricha of truth and justice and is deemed responsible for helping to mould humanity. Babal√∫ Ay√© is the oricha associated with disease, and is regarded as having the power to both infect and cure. Orula is the oricha of divination, who in Santer√≠a's mythology was present at the creation of humanity and thus is aware of everyone's destiny. Some of the oricha are regarded as being antagonistic to one another; Chango and Ogun are for instance described as enemies. The oricha are often conflated with particular Roman Catholic saints based on similar attributes between the two. For instance, the Holy Infant of Atocha, a depiction of Christ as a child, is conflated with Elegu√°, who is seen as having a childlike nature. Similarly, Babal√∫ Ay√©, who is associated with disease, is often identified with the Catholic Saint Lazarus, who rose from the dead. Chang√≥ is typically conflated with Santa Barbara because they both wear red. Och√∫n is usually equated with Cuba's patron saint, Our Lady of Charity. In many cases, an oricha can be associated with multiple Roman Catholic saints. It has been argued that Yoruba slaves initially linked their traditional deities with Catholic saints as a means of concealing their continued worship of the former from the Roman Catholic authorities, or of helping to facilitate social mobility by assimilating into Roman Catholic social norms. P√©rez y Mena thus argued that the saints should be seen only as a \\"shell\\" for the oricha. As evidence, he highlighted that some practitioners maintain that the oricha and the saints are distinct. Each oricha is associated with specific songs, rhythms, colors, numbers, animals, and foodstuffs. Ogun for instance is associated with various metal, and especially iron, objects, whereas Chang√≥ is associated with wooden objects. Practitioners argue that each person is \\"born to\\" a particular oricha, whether or not they decide to devote themselves to that deity. This is a connection that, adherents believe, has been set before birth. Practitioners refer to this oricha as one which \\"rules the head\\" of an individual; this entity is described as their \\"head\\" oricha, and the \\"owner of the head.\\" If the oricha is male then it is described as the individual's \\"father\\", while if the oricha is female then it is understood as the person's \\"mother\\". This oricha is deemed to influence the personality of the individual, and thus by examining a person's personality traits their associated oricha could be recognised. Practitioners also believe that an individual's particular oricha can also be discerned through divination. To ensure the protection of a particular oricha, practitioners are encouraged to make offerings to them, sponsor ceremonies in their honor, and live in accordance with their wishes, as determined through divination. Practitioners are concerned at the prospect of offending the oricha. Practitioners of Santer√≠a believe that the oricha can communicate with humans through divination, prayers, dreams, music, and dance. Many practitioners also describe how they \\"read\\" messages from the oricha in everyday interactions and events. For instance, a practitioner who meets a child at a traffic intersection may interpret this as a message from Elegu√°, who is often depicted as a child and who is perceived as the \\"guardian\\" of the crossroads. At that point the practitioner may turn to divination to determine the precise meaning of the encounter. The information obtained from these messages may then help practitioners make decisions about their job, residence, or behavior. =Birth and the dead= A selection of offerings that have been placed at the base of a tree in Cuba as part of a Santer√≠a rite Santer√≠a teaches that the essence of a person, their eled√°, resides within the head. It holds that before birth, the or√≠ or eled√° goes to Olodumare, the creator divinity, and is given its essential character. It is also before Olodumare, this belief holds, that the individual forms their relationship with a specific oricha. This oricha will thenceforth be \\"the owner of the head\\" and will influence the individual's character after they are born. This symbolic emphasis on the head led the anthropologist Michael Atwood Mason to describe it as \\"the bodily center of the spiritual life in Santer√≠a\\", with various rituals giving particular attention to this part of the human anatomy. The concept of the eled√° derives from Yoruba traditional religion, where it is seen as the \\"spiritual double\\" of a person. In Santer√≠a, this idea has syncretised with Roman Catholic beliefs about guardian angels and the idea of the protecciones or protector spirits from Spiritism. There is no strict orthodoxy on this issue and thus there are differences in interpretation. Ancestor veneration plays an important role in Santer√≠a. The religion entails propitiating the spirits of the dead, known as egun, esp√≠ritus, or muertos. Practitioners believe that the dead can influence the living and must be treated with respect, awe, and kindness; they are consulted at all ceremonies. Although the dead are not perceived as being as powerful as the oricha, they are still regarded as having the ability to assist the living, with whom they can communicate through dreams, intuition, and spirit possession. Santer√≠a teaches that through practice, a person can learn to both see and communicate with the dead. Practitioners will often leave offerings out to the spirits of the dead to placate and please them, often in the form of seven glasses of water. Especially propitiated are those members of the dead who are deemed to be ancestors. These ancestors can either be a person's hereditary forebears or a member of their ritual group, with practitioners believing that when a creyente dies, they too become an ancestor. In Santer√≠a, the egun are often represented by a cane carved with anthropomorphic faces. Adherents believe that each individual has a cuadro espiritual (\\"spiritual portrait\\" or \\"spiritual picture\\") of various egun who protect and bless them. Individuals can have as many as 25 protectores, or protective ancestral spirits. The religion maintains that all people have multiple spirits of the dead that accompany them at all times, and that these can be either benevolent, malevolent, or a mix of both. Practitioners also believe that the number and identities of these spirits can be determined through divination. It draws a distinction between evolved spirits, who can help those they are attached to, and unevolved spirits, who lack the wisdom and skill to be useful and instead cause havoc. Santer√≠a teaches that through offerings and prayers, individuals can help some of their unevolved spirits to become evolved. Some practitioners believe that unevolved spirits lurk in the air and can be distilled by the rain, through which they can attach themselves to individuals who have been rained on. Santer√≠a also divides the spirits into categories which each show different traits, reflecting stereotypes about different social groups in Cuban society, with such spirits often portrayed as being African, Haitian, Gypsy, Arab, or Plains Indian. The gitano (gypsy) spirits for instance are believed to have the power to warn of impending troubles and diagnose illnesses while the congo spirits of Africa are perceived as strong-willed, powerful, and adept at guiding people through hostile circumstances. =Ach√©= The concept of ach√© is a major cosmological concept in Yoruba traditional religion and has been transferred to Santer√≠a. It is also present in other Yoruba-derived traditions such as Candombl√©. Mason called it the \\"ritual generative power\\", the medical anthropologist Johan Wedel called it \\"life force\\" or \\"divine force\\", while Fern√°ndez Olmos and Paravisini-Gebert referred to it as \\"a spiritual-mystical energy or power found in varying degrees and in many forms throughout the universe\\". The ethnomusicologist Katherine Hagedorn described ach√© as \\"the realized and inherent divine potential in all aspects of life, even in apparently inert objects.\\" She added that \\"Ach√© is neither good nor bad; rather, ach√© is motion\\". Among practitioners, ach√© is sometimes described as conveying notions of luck, health, and prosperity. Practitioners believe that ach√© permeates all aspects of life, but that the creator divinity Olodumare is the ultimate embodiment of it. Santer√≠a teaches that all beings possess ach√© but that initiates gain more of it. It holds that ach√© can emanate from the human body via speech, song, dance, and drumming, and can be transmitted through such acts as singing praise songs for the oricha or sacrificing an animal. It is seen as having the power to fortify a person's health. =Morality, ethics, and gender roles= Two practitioners of Santer√≠a taking part in a Cajon de Muertos ceremony in 2011 Santer√≠a has standards for behavior and moral edicts that practitioners are expected to live by, with the religion presenting strict rules regarding how to interact with other people and with the supernatural. Mythological stories about the oricha contribute to the moral and social consciousness of practitioners. In Santer√≠a, as in other Afro-Cuban religions, respect for elders and superiors is given great emphasis. A general attitude in Santer√≠a is that if an individual maintains good character, the oricha will aid them. It does not polarise good and evil, with all things being perceived as being complementary and relative. Practitioners often believe that individuals have a specific destiny, usually referred to as destino (destiny) or camino (road). This is considered to be preordained but forgotten at birth; it is not often, however, seen as an absolute predetermination. Many of the ritual practices found in Santer√≠a focus on determining the nature of one's destiny. Many practitioners of Santer√≠a characterize their religion as being more life- affirming than Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Several academics have described Santer√≠a as having a \\"here-and-now\\" ethos distinct from that of Christianity, and the social scientist Mercedes C. Sandoval suggested that many Cubans chose to practice Santer√≠a over Roman Catholicism or Spiritism because it emphasizes techniques for dealing with pragmatic problems in life. In the U.S., some African American adherents have contrasted what they regard as the African-derived ethos of Santer√≠a with the non-African origins of Christianity. Due to this, some practitioners have linked Santer√≠a in with their own black nationalist ideology. Santer√≠a places restrictions on the tasks that women are permitted to do while menstruating. Similar restrictions are also placed on homosexual males, traditionally prohibiting them from taking part in certain forms of divination and ritual drumming. However, many gay men operate as santeros, and there is an erroneous stereotype among Cubans and Cuban Americans that all Santer√≠a priests are gay men. Some priestesses of the religion are lesbians. Many gay male practitioners have expressed strong identification with Chango, a hyper-masculine oricha who nevertheless dressed as a woman to evade capture by his enemies in one of the myths about him. Some gay men have expressed surprise when divination indicates that it is another oricha, and not Chango, who is their personal deity. P√©rez y Mena observed that practitioners in the United States generally adopted more progressive stances on issues surrounding gender and sexuality than their counterparts in Cuba. Practices Santer√≠a has an elaborate system of ritual, one which incorporates song, dance, spirit possession, and animal sacrifice. These rituals are known as ceremonias (ceremonies), while parties for the oricha are called g√ºemilere. Much of its focus is on solving the problems of everyday life. Practitioners usually use the term \\"work\\" in reference both to secular and ritual activity; thus the words \\"working ocha\\" are used to describe religious rites. Santer√≠a is an initiatory religion, one which is organized around a structured hierarchy. An ethos of secrecy pervades many of its practices, with initiates often refusing to discuss certain topics with non- initiates. For this reason, Mason thought Santer√≠a could be described as a secret society. For ritual purposes, the Lucum√≠ language is often used in Santer√≠a. It is sometimes referred to as la lengua de los orichas (\\"the language of the oricha\\"), and is regarded as a divine language through which practitioners can contact the oricha. Lucum√≠ texts and phrases derive from the Yoruba language, although they have become \\"increasingly fragmented and unintelligible\\" since the 19th century. Most initiates know between a few dozen through to hundreds of Lucum√≠ words and phrases, although there are initiates who are not comfortable using it. Most Cubans do not understand the Lucum√≠ language, barring a few words that have filtered into Cuban Spanish, the daily language spoken by most practitioners. Most practitioners of Santer√≠a are themselves unable to offer detailed explanations of the meaning of Lucum√≠ texts. As Yoruba transitioned into Lucum√≠ over the centuries, the Yoruba pronunciations of many words were forgotten, and in the early 21st century some practitioners have made a conscious study of the Yoruba language to better understand the original meaning of Lucum√≠ words. For much of the 20th century, initiates have kept libretas, notebooks in which they have written down material relevant to the practice of Santer√≠a, such as Lucum√≠ terms or the attributes of specific oricha. They may share the contents of these books with their own initiates; others keep them strictly private. =Houses of worship= A Santer√≠a priest with ritual paraphernalia The building in which Santer√≠a's rituals are carried out is known as the casa templo (\\"house of worship\\"), ' (\\"house of saints\\"), casa de religi√≥n (\\"house of religion\\"), or il√©. These casas are usually the personal home of a santero or santera. The casa will typically have an igbodu (\\"sacred grove of the festival\\"), an inner room where the most important rituals take place. There will also be an ey√° ar√°nla or sala, often a living room, where semi-private rites can be conducted. Another space, the iban balo, or patio, will be used for public occasions, as well as for the cultivation of plants and the housing of animals due to be sacrificed. Along with spaces to perform ceremonies, the casa will typically include a place to store ritual paraphernalia, kitchen facilities, and space for visiting practitioners to sleep. In Santer√≠a, the concept of the casa (\\"house\\") refers not only to the physical building in which ceremonies take place, but also the community of practitioners who meet there. In this sense, many casa trace a lineage back to the 19th century, with many santeros and santeras capable of listing the many practitioners who have been initiated into that casa over the decades. In some ceremonies, the names of these individuals, who are regarded as the ancestors of the house, are recited in chronological order. Most casa are established by a santero or santera who has attracted a following. Those apprentices who follow these initiates are known as their ahijado (godson) or ahijada (goddaughter). They refer to their santero/santera as padrino (godfather) or madrina (godmother). The relationship between santeros/santeras and their 'godchildren' is central to the religion's social organization. The 'godchildren' are expected to contribute both their labor and finances to religious events held at the casa and in return the santero/santera provides assistance for their needs. Within the religion, offending one's godparent is regarded as also offending the oricha that \\"rules the head.\\" There are nevertheless cases where an initiate falls out with their godparent. Practitioners believe that the more godchildren a santera or santero has, the greater their ach√©. Different casa are largely autonomous, allowing for variation in their ritual practices. There is nevertheless often interaction between the members of different casas. In Cuba, it is common for Santer√≠a practitioners to meet with each other regularly, and to regard each other as being akin to a family: the familia de santo. Conversely, in an area like Veracruz in Mexico, many practitioners attend group rituals and then leave, sometimes never seeing their co-practitioners again. A ritual greeting, known as a moforibale, involves lying on the ground and bowing one's head to the floor. The precise form of the moforibale differs depending on whether the individual's personal oricha is male or female. It is performed at various points as a means of expressing respect, often in front of the altar; all practitioners prostrate themselves in this way before the oricha. =Shrines and otanes= An outdoor Cuban altar photographed in 2015 The igbodu within the casa will typically contain an altar, while individual practitioners will also often have altars to specific oricha in their own homes. The process of creating these altars is considered to be expensive and time-consuming. Specific items will be placed on the altar that have particular relevance to the oricha it is devoted to. Sacred objects used in Santer√≠a are known as fundamentos (foundations); any ritual paraphernalia that is not anointed through the bautismo rite is referred to as judia (Jewish). Typically placed on the altar are the sopera porcelain vessels, often tureens, which contain various sacred items, most notably the ot√°n stones (pl. otanes). The ot√°n stones are regarded as both containing and representing the oricha; they have been described as the \\"primary representation\\" of the oricha in Santer√≠a. They are therefore understood as being alive. Many of the stones will have been collected from the landscape and then divination used to determine which ones contain an oricha and, if so, which oricha it is. Specific otanes sometimes display traits linking them to particular oricha; for example ocean stones are linked with Yemaya, river pebbles with Och√∫n, and meteorite fragments with Chango. Each oricha is deemed to prefer a particular color and number of otanes in sopera devoted to them; Chango has six or ten black stones, Obatala has eight white stones, while Ochun favors five yellow stones, for instance. Many practitioners place great emphasis on the stones, perceived as being sources of power, something linked to ach√©. Adherents believe that older stones have more ach√© than younger ones. Some of the most powerful stones are claimed to have been brought to Cuba from Africa by enslaved persons who concealed them within their stomachs during the crossing of the Atlantic Ocean. A sopera containing ot√°n stones associated with the oricha Yemaya, who is associated with the sea; other items associated with her decorate this altar The otanes undergo a bautismo (baptism) rite; this allows them to be \\"born\\" and involves the being washed in osain, a mixture of herbs and water, after which they are \\"fed\\" with animal blood. When a santero or santera receives their stones, they take an oath to protect them at all times and to feed them at least annually. By feeding them, initiates believe that the stones gain the strength to aid people. Also placed within the sopera, alongside the otanes, are a series of cowrie shells; usually 18 are added although the precise number differs depending on which oricha the sopera is devoted to. The sopera will often be covered by a cloth known as a pa√±uelo that is colored in accordance with the oricha in question. Often laid over the sopera are necklaces known as collares, representing various oricha. Various artefacts might be selected to represent the oricha; a wooden axe for Chang√≥ or a fan for Och√∫n, for instance. The anthropologist Ysamur Flores found Chinese Taoist figurines being used to represent the oricha on one Cuban altar. A particularly ornate altar used in the ceremonial space is known as a trono (\\"throne\\"). In an igbodu there is a display of three distinct thrones (draped with royal blue, white, and red satin) that represent the seats of the queens, kings, and the deified warriors. Also placed on the altar are offerings of food and flowers. In addition to their altar to the oricha, many practitioners also have altars set aside for the spirits of the dead. Such altars typically consist of a white-covered table known as a b√≥veda, something derived from the White Table of Kardecian Spiritism. These often contain photographs of deceased relatives as well as offerings placed to them. Popular offerings for the spirits of the dead include seven glasses of water, a Cafecito coffee, and the aguardiente liquor. Many practitioners will also enshrine their family ancestors on the floor of the bathroom, under the sink. This location is chosen so that the ancestors are located below the vertical water pipes, allowing the spirits to transition between the realms via water, which is their preferred medium for travel. =Offerings and animal sacrifice= In Santer√≠a, offerings to the oricha are referred to as ebb√≥ or √©bo. These can consist of fruit, flowers, candles, or slaughtered animals; Santer√≠a thus entails animal sacrifice, an act known as matanza. Initiates are expected to make a sacrifice on a regular basis, and at least once a year. Sometimes, divination is used to determine when a sacrifice should take place. The sacrifice is an offering to the deity; blood is regarded as the food of the oricha. Practitioners typically believe that by killing an animal in this fashion, its lifeforce is directly transferred to the oricha, thereby strengthening the latter's ach√©. An animal that struggles to avoid being killed is sometimes understood as having particular strength which will then pass to the oricha. A chicken being sacrificed at a 2017 Santer√≠a ritual in Havana Birds are commonly used for the ritual, including guinea fowl, chickens, and doves. Methods of killing include having their throats slit or their heads twisted and ripped off. Mason recounted a sacrifice as part of an initiaton whereby a chick was slammed against a sink to kill it. For rituals of greater importance, sacrifices are often of four-legged animals, including dogs. Once killed, the animal's severed heads may be placed on top of the vessels containing objects associated with the oricha to which the sacrifice has been directed. After the animal's carcass has been butchered, some of the organs may be cooked and then offered to the oricha. Some practitioners have explained that animal sacrifice is used as an acceptable substitute to human sacrifice. Due to its links with blood, menstruating women are generally prohibited from involvement in matanza rituals. When a sacrifice is made, some of the blood may be added to omiero, an infusion of herbs and water that is regarded as the most powerful liquid in Santer√≠a. Regarded as containing much ach√©, this liquid is used for removing malevolent influences, in ceremonies for baptising ritual tools, and for washing the hands of the matador before they carry out a sacrifice. Santer√≠a's animal sacrifice has been a cause of concern for many non-practitioners, and has brought adherents into confrontation with the law. In the U.S., various casas were raided by police and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, leading to groups being more secretive about when their rituals were scheduled. In 1993, the issue of animal sacrifice in Santer√≠a was taken to the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah. The court ruled that animal cruelty laws targeted specifically at Santer√≠a were unconstitutional. In 2009, legal and religious issues that related to animal sacrifice, animal rights, and freedom of religion were taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in the case of Jose Merced, President Templo Yoruba Omo Orisha Texas, Inc., v. City of Euless. The court ruled that the city of Euless, Texas was interfering in Merced's right to religious freedom by preventing him from sacrificing animals. Practitioners will often conduct an √©bbo with the hope of receiving something in return from the oricha. If this fails to materialise, practitioners may resort to several explanations: that the details of the ritual were incorrect, that the priest or priestess carrying out the rite lacked sufficient ach√©, or that the wrong √©bbo was carried out for the situation. =Initiation= An initiate with ceremonial material in Havana Initiation is known as kariocha, \\"making ocha\\", or \\"making santo\\". A charge is usually levied for initiation; this varies depending on the status of the practitioner and the wealth of the client but is often the equivalent of a year's wage, or more. Santer√≠a initiation ceremonies derive from those in Yoruba traditional religion but is almost always carried out for adults, whereas among the Yoruba, initiation can also involve children. Each initiation varies in its details, although practitioners often try to ensure a veil of secrecy around the process, ensuring that the precise details are not discovered by non-initiates. The initiate is known as an iyab√≥ or iyaw√≥, a term meaning both \\"slave of the oricha\\" and \\"bride of the oricha\\". As well as the santero or santera overseeing the initiation ceremony, the event may be attended by an oyubona (\\"one who witnesses\\"), who acts as a secondary godparent to the new initiate. The process of initiation takes place over seven days, with an additional two days of preparatory rituals. Before the main seven-day ceremony, usually two days before, a misa espiritual will often take place to gain the blessings of the ancestral egun. During this ritual, it is common for the egun to be invited to possess the initiate. One day before the main events, an eb√≥ de entrada (\\"opening sacrifice\\") often takes place, with sacrifices being made to either the oricha or the egun. Next comes the ceremonia del r√≠o (ceremony of the initiate), which involves the oyubona and the initiate. It entails honey and the ochinch√≠n omelette being offered to the oricha Och√∫n, with the oyubona then engaging in divination to determine if Och√∫n has accepted the sacrifice. In the rompimiento (breaking), the oyubona then takes the initiate to a river. There, the initiate has their clothing ripped off of them before they are washed in the river water, used both as a purification and to gain Och√∫n's blessing. The rest of the initiation takes place in the igbodu, or inner sanctum of the casa. For the rest of the seven days, the initiate remains here, sleeping upon a mat on the floor. No one who is not directly involved in the initiation ceremonies is permitted entry. During the prendici√≥n (pinning) ritual, a heavy necklace known as the collar de mazo is placed on the initiate. Also taking place here is the lavatorio (\\"washing\\"); the santero/santera overseeing the procedure washes the initiate in omiero, a type of sacred water that has been infused with various herbs. This is done to rid the initiate of malevolent or harmful spirits of the dead which might have attached themselves. The initiate's head usually receives most attention in this washing; often, their hair will be shaved off. This cleansing of the head is known as the rogaci√≥n de cabeza. A Santer√≠a shrine in Trinidad, Cuba The new initiate is given beaded necklaces, known as elekes, ilekes, or collares. Each of these necklaces is given a different color associated with a specific deity. They are also given their own sacred stones. An additional ritual, known as \\"receiving the warriors\\", is a ritual where the initiated receives objects from their padrino that represents the warrior oricha. At some point during the week, and usually on the third day, the initiate will undergo the it√°, a session with a diviner in which the latter will inform them about their strengths, weaknesses, and taboos that they should observe. This is known as the d√≠a del it√° (\\"day of history\\"). At this point, the initiate's Lucum√≠ ritual name will be revealed by the diviner; this is a praise name of the oricha which rules their head. It will often incorporate elements which indicate the initiate's tutelary oricha; devotees of Yemaj√° for instance usually include om√≠ (\\"water\\") in their name, while those of Chang√≥ often have ob√° (\\"king\\"). This next ritual is known as the asiento (seating), or the coronaci√≥n (coronation), and it is believed that it marks the point when the ach√© of the tutelary oricha which \\"rules their head\\" is literally placed inside the initiate's cranium. The ot√°nes of various oricha are placed to the head of the initiate, culminating in those of their own tutelary oricha. A matanza animal sacrifice usually follows, designed to feed all of the major oricha. At least five four-legged animals are usually killed at this point, often accompanied by 25 birds. The initiate then performs the moforiba by lying on the ground as a sign of respect to the oricha that they have received. Then they rise and are welcomed by their godparent, reflecting that they are now part of their casa. The following day is el D√≠a del Medio (\\"the middle day\\"), a public celebration at the initiation. Guests, who may include the initiate's family and friends, visit them to pay homage. A drumming ceremony takes place, after which the assembled individuals feast on meat from animals killed the day before. On the seventh day of the initiation, which is usually a market or church day in Cuba, the new initiate leaves the casa and visits the marketplace, where they make offerings to Elegu√° and steals something small, also as an offering to Elegu√°. The new initiate can finally take their tureen containing their otanes back to their home. They may then undergo a year-long period known as the iyaworaje (\\"journey of the iyawo\\") during which they are expected to observe various restrictions. The nature of these restrictions depends on the initiate's tutelary oricha. For instance, Hagedorn related that after her initiation into a Cuban casa, her initiator required her to sleep and eat on the floor for three months, abstain from sexual intercourse for 16 days, and both wear only white and not cut her hair for a year. These actions help to display the initiate's commitment to the religion and demarcate them from non-initiates. At the end of the year, the initiate conducts a ceremony known as eb√≥ del a√±o. It is only once this is done that they are allowed to lead many rituals and to be involved in the initiation of new converts. The annual celebration of one's initiation into the religion is known as the cumplea√±os de santo (\\"birthday in the saint\\"). As an initiate becomes more deeply involved in the religion, they learn about each of the different deities and make offerings to each of them in exchange for spiritual blessings and ach√©. They are expected to familiarise themselves with various herbs and their different associations and uses. Santeros and santeras often emphasise this teaching in a non-verbal manner, encouraging their initiate to learn through taking part in the ritual activities. As they gain more knowledge, the initiate is referred to as a serio (\\"serious\\"), indicating their greater commitment to the religion. =Toque de santo= Drummers at a Santer√≠a ceremony in Havana in 2017 The main public ritual performance in Santer√≠a is a drumming ceremony known as toque de santo, sometimes also called a tambor. Many practitioners consider it to be the religion's most powerful ceremony. The term toque links to both the verb tocar (\\"to play\\") as well as the noun toque (\\"rhythm\\"). The toque de santo is usually seen as an offering to the oricha, and practitioners may organize one to gain a particular favor from these deities. The toque may last for several hours, although can be shorter than this. The goal of the rhythms and songs is to summon the oricha to earth; it is the collective energy built up by the group that is believed to be necessary in achieving this. In turn, the oricha are believed capable of soothing the grieving, healing the sick, blessing the deserving, and rebuking those who have behaved badly. Drumming The toque de santo is marked out by its use of double-headed drums called bat√°, which is sometimes regarded as the central symbol of Santer√≠a. There are multiple types of bat√°: the iy√° is the largest, the it√≥tele is smaller, and the ok√≥nkolo is the smallest. For ceremonial purposes, these drums must be made from wood, with no metal structural elements; adding metal elements could offend Chango, who is associated with wooden artefacts, because of their association with his enemy, Ogun. They may however have brass bells, known as chaworo, affixed to their rim; these bells are associated with Och√∫n. Before they are used in ceremonies, these drums are typically baptized, after which they are referred to as a tambor de fundamento. This process includes washing the drums in omiero and making sacrifices to Osain. It also included the addition of an afoubo, a small leather bag containing items including a parrot feather and glass beads, to the interior of the drum. Several types of bat√° drum, which are used in the toque de santo ritual Practitioners believe that the consecrated bat√° drums contain a sacred inner substance known as a√±√°. This a√±√° is perceived as an avatar of Och√∫n. Many drummers avoid referring to the a√±√° in public and may not refer to it by name. Drums which have not been consecrated are not viewed as containing a√±√°, and are called tambores jud√¨os ('Jewish drums'); a term which Hagedorn attributed to the historic antisemitism of Cuban culture. Each oricha is associated with its own rhythms, which can be played on the drums. Some of the rhythms played on the drums are associated either with a certain group of oricha or all of the oricha. Those playing the bat√° are referred to as bat√°leros. Santer√≠a drumming is male dominated; Hagedorn observed that this drum culture was \\"pervasively macho\\". Women are discouraged from playing the bat√° during ceremonies, as it is feared that their menstrual blood would weaken the a√±√° of the drum. Many practitioners believe that the women will be rendered infertile if they do so. Many groups also argue that the men playing these drums must be heterosexual. Hagedorn noted that, during the 1990s, some female practitioners in the United States had started playing the bat√° at ceremonies, in contradiction with the older taboo. Singing and dancing A dance dedicated to the oricha Och√∫n recorded in Santiago de Cuba in 2013 At these ceremonies, praise songs for the oricha are sung. Each oricha is associated with their own specific songs. The lead singer at such ceremonies is known as an akpw√≥n. Hagedorn characterized the akpw√≥n as a \\"religious mediator\\" whose role was to focus on bringing down the oricha. During the opening verse of the song, the akpw√≥n may break into a personal prayer. The akpw√≥n can switch from song to song quickly, with the drummers having to adapt their rhythm accordingly. A chorus of singers will respond to the akpw√≥n, often while swaying back and forth. These choral responses may split into a two or three- part harmony. Each of the oricha is associated with a particular dance. The dances at the toque de santo are believed to generate ach√©, strengthening the link between the realms of the oricha and humanity. Dancing either alone or first in front of the drums at the toque de santo is considered a privilege and is usually reserved for the most experienced initiate present. There are specific rules of engagement that are laid out for taking part in the toque de santo. Dancing poorly in the toque de santo is considered an insult to the oricha. Possession Possession plays an important part in Santer√≠a, and the purpose of the toque de santo is to call down an oricha to possess one of the participants. Those possessed may then display gestures that are associated with a particular oricha. For instance, those believing themselves possessed by Ochun may wipe their skirt over other people, representing the waves of the ocean, while those regarding themselves as being possessed by Elegu√° may steal items such as hats or jewellery from assembled participants. The possessed will often speak in the Lucum√≠ language. During the possession, the possessed individual is referred to as the \\"horse\\", with the oricha having \\"mounted\\" them. According to practitioners, becoming possessed by an oricha requires an individual giving up their consciousness to the deity, and accordingly they often claim no memory of the events that occurred during the possession. Some have stated that reaching the mental state whereby an individual can become possessed takes much practice. Once an individual is possessed, they may be taken into an adjacent room where they are dressed in the ritual clothing pertaining to the possessing oricha, after which they are returned to the main room. The possessed individual will then provide healing or dispense advice; sometimes a possessed person will reprimand others present, for instance for failing to carry out their ritual obligations, or warn them of something. Possession permits practitioners the opportunity to interact directly with their deity. Some practitioners have also reported becoming possessed by an oricha in non-ritual contexts, such as while sleeping or walking through the streets. Toque de santo are rarely documented with photographs or through audio or visual recording because the religion's practitioners often regard such recordings as being offensive or sacrilegious. However, the toque is also often performed for entertainment purposes, outside of the ritual environment; Hagedorn referred to these non-religious toques as \\"folkloric performances\\". These may be performed much the same as those performed at Santer√≠a rituals, although will not be conducted with the intent of calling down the oricha. Some drumming groups who perform toque at both religious and non-religious events may omit certain parts from the latter to distinguish them from the former. There have also been cases whereby those attending non-religious toques have still felt themselves to be possessed by an oricha. Various innovations devised for non-religious toques have subsequently filtered back into the performance of Santer√≠a rites. =Healing practices= A selection of paraphernalia associated with Santer√≠a for sale in Havana Healing is an important practice in Santer√≠a, and health problems are the most common reason why people approach a santero or santera. Clients meet with santeros or santeras to receive healing treatments, with those dispensing healing practices sometimes being termed curanderos, or osainistas. These practitioners typically use divination to determine the cause of an ailment before prescribing treatment. Santer√≠a teaches that supernatural factors cause or exacerbate human ailments. It is believed that oricha may make someone sick, either as punishment for transgression or to encourage them to make a change in their life, often to become an initiate. The oricha must then be propitiated to stop, sometimes with the sick individual receiving initiation. Santer√≠a also holds that a spirit of the dead may attach itself to an individual and cause them harm that way. Adherents also often believe that humans can harm one another through supernatural means, either involuntarily, by giving them the mal de ojo (evil eye), or deliberately, through the use of brujer√≠a (witchcraft). The latter are often perceived as acting out of envy, and as having utilised cursing techniques from Palo Monte. Herbalism is a major component of Santer√≠a healing practices, with plants having an important role in the religion. Practitioners believe that each species of plant has its own ach√© and that it is this which holds healing power. In the Lucum√≠ language, such plants are called egwe, a term deriving from the Yoruba word ewe. Practitioners often believe that medicinal plants are more powerful if harvested from the wild rather than being cultivated, for the latter can lack ach√©. They often also believe that different types of plant have different temperaments and personalities; some are shy or easily frightened and thus need to be approached with the appropriate etiquette. The santero/santera may also prescribe omiero, the infusion of herbs in water which practitioners believe has healing properties. Aside from the use of herbs, Santer√≠a traditional healing rituals include animal sacrifice, offerings, altar building, music, dance, and possession trance. Practitioners also believe that certain oricha should be turned to assist the healing of specific ailments; Ochun is for instance usually requested when dealing with genital problems. Particular focuses of Santer√≠a healing include issues of female reproduction, skin complaints, gastrointestinal and respiratory problems, and sexually transmitted infections such as syphilis and gonorrhoea. Other practitioners have provided concoctions designed to induce abortion. A common response to ailments is for Santer√≠a healers to prescribe a spiritual cleansing and/or a bath. Many santeros and santeras oversee a healing ritual called the santiguo meaning \\"to bless\\" or \\"to heal by blessing\\"; this is particularly used for children. People who are sick may undergo the rogaci√≥n de la cabeza (blessing of the head) ritual, in which coconut water and cotton are applied on the head. Practitioners believe that in doing so, they are feeding the head, in which the or√≠ resides. Many practitioners will encourage their clients to seek mainstream medical assistance, either from doctors or psychotherapists, for their problems, arguing that their own techniques should be complementary rather than exclusive. = Divination = Divination is a central aspect of Santer√≠a ritual, taking place before all major rites and being utilized by devotees at critical moments of their life. Three main divinatory techniques are employed in the religion: Obi, dilog√∫n, and If√°. Highly skilled diviners are known as or√≠ate, or as italeros. Clients will approach these diviners for a divinatory session, referred to as a consulta (consultation), usually to ask for advice about their health, family problems, or legal issues. Some initiates work every day as an or√≠ate. The client will pay the diviner for their services, with the fee referred to as a derecho. Attending a divination ritual in this way is commonly the first time that an individual encounters Santer√≠a so directly. During the session, an image of the overseeing oricha is often brought out and offerings of food placed before it. The diviner will then cast small objects onto a board or table and draw interpretations based on the way in which they fall. The diviner asks the client various questions and then seeks to answer them by making multiple throws. The diviner will ultimately determine which oricha will assist the client in dealing with their problems and outline what sacrifices will be appropriate to secure the aid of said oricha. A Cuban santero in Havana engaging in a form of divination Obi, which is also known as Biagu√©, involves the casting of four pieces of a dried coconut shell, with the manner in which they fall being used to fathom an answer to a particular question. Any practitioner can utilise this divinatory technique, which is also employed by adherents of Palo Monte. Dilog√∫n entails the casting of cowrie shells, and is considered more complex in that it requires a knowledge of the patakie stories. Dilog√∫n typically entails the use of a set of 21 cowrie shells, filed flat on their round side; these are fed with both omiero and blood. Like Obi, dilog√∫n is generally seen as being open to all practitioners of Santer√≠a, although some groups hold that only postmenopausal women should hold the role of italeras, a diviner who uses the shells. Santer√≠a involves the use of the If√° divination system, which is often understood as the most complex and prestigious form of divination used in the religion. The two are closely linked, sharing the same mythology and conception of the universe, although If√° also has a separate existence from Santer√≠a. High priests of If√° are known as babalawos and although their presence is not essential to Santer√≠a ceremonies, they often attend in their capacity as diviners. In Cuba, many individuals are both santeros and babalawos, although it is not uncommon for babalawos to perceive themselves as being superior to most santeros. Unlike the more open policy for Santer√≠a initiates, only heterosexual men are traditionally allowed to become babalawos, although homosexual male babalawos have been recorded both in Cuba and the U.S. Women are prohibited from taking on the role, a restriction explained through the story that the oricha Orula was furious that Yemaya, his wife, had used his tabla divining board and subsequently decided to ban women from ever touching it again. Initiation as a babalawo requires a payment to the initiator and is typically regarded as highly expensive. The oricha of If√°, Orula or ·ªåÃÄr√∫nmila, also has a prominent place within Santer√≠a. Orula is believed to oversee divination; once an individual is initiated as a babalawo they are given a pot containing various items, including palm nuts, which is believed to be the literal embodiment of Orula. Babalawos provide ebb√≥ offerings to Orula, including animal sacrifices and gifts of money. In Cuba, If√° typically involves the casting of consecrated palm nuts to answer a specific question. The babalawo then interprets the message of the nuts depending on how they have fallen; there are 256 possible configurations in the If√° system, which the babalawo is expected to have memorised. Individuals approach the babalawo seeking guidance, often on financial matters, at which the diviner will consult Orula through the established divinatory method. In turn, those visiting the babalawos pay them for their services. =Charms and amulets= Santer√≠a features the creation of protective charms known as resguardos. These are created using herbs and blood and produced while in contact with the otanes, from which they are believed to gain invisible fluid. Resguardos are often given to small children, who are deemed particularly vulnerable to sorcery. Charms and amulets are also used as a general prophylaxis against illness, as for instance with ears of corn which are wrapped in purple ribbon and placed behind a doorway. Other rituals are designed to protect against sorcery, as for instance with the scattering of petals of the g√°lan de d√≠a in the house or the placement of okra by the door. In Cuba, protective rituals from Santer√≠a have often been invoked in hospitals to prevent the cambio de vida (life switch), a practice by which the ailments of a sick person are believed to be transferred to another individual, often without the latter's knowledge. The rituals for self-protection have also resulted in Santer√≠a being adopted by various groups involved in narcotics trafficking within the U.S. =Espiritismo and the dead= In Santer√≠a, funeral rites are called itulu, and are designed to appease the soul of the deceased. As part of this, a funeral mass is held in a Roman Catholic church nine days after the individual has died to ensure that their soul successfully travels to the realm of the spirits. This is followed by a year of additional rites for the deceased individual. This period is then ended with the levantamiento de platos, the breaking of a dish, to symbolise the final departure of the deceased from the realm of the living. As well as having been influenced by Spiritism during the 19th century, Santer√≠a is often intertwined with Espiritismo, a Puerto Rican tradition focused on contacting the dead; this is particularly the case in areas such as New York and New Jersey. This has resulted in references to \\"Santerismo\\" as a blend between the two traditions. Various santeros or santeras are believed to have the power to communicate with spirits. Some practitioners engage in seances to communicate with the spirits of the dead, known as misas espirituales (\\"spiritual masses\\") which are led by mortevas (\\"deaders\\") who are usually women. During these rituals, the medium may be possessed by a spirit of the dead, who then engages in healing practices or offers advice and warning to assembled people. These are a practice adopted from Espiritismo. They are often included as a part of both initiation and funerary rites. An additional ritual found in Santer√≠a is the tambor para eg√∫n, a drum ceremony for the spirits of the dead. Some practitioners whose approach to Santer√≠a is influenced by Espiritismo also create cloth dolls for deceased family members and spirit guides. In these instances, the spirit is believed to enter and inhabit the doll; some practitioners state that they can see the spirit within the doll. Sometimes the clothing on these dolls is changed to please the inhabiting spirit, while offerings, such as glasses of water or fruit, are placed before them. These spirit dolls may also be passed down through the generations in a single family. History=Enslavement: 1511‚Äì1886= Cuba, the Caribbean island from which Santer√≠a originates After the Spanish Empire conquered Cuba, the island's indigenous Arawak and Taino people were soon annihilated. The Spanish colonialists established sugar, tobacco, and coffee plantations on Cuba and turned to the purchase of enslaved people sold at West African ports as a new source of labor for these plantations. Enslaved Africans first arrived on Cuba in 1511. Once in Cuba, the enslaved Africans were divided into groups termed naciones (nations), often based on their West African port of embarkation rather than their own ethno-cultural background. The United Kingdom had abolished slavery in the early 19th century and from the 1820s began patrolling the West African coast to prevent further shipments of slaves to the Americas. The trade nevertheless continued clandestinely, with Cuba continuing to receive new slaves until at least 1860. Full emancipation occurred on Cuba in 1886. Most enslaved Africans who arrived in Cuba did so in the 19th century; the majority came from a stretch of Western Africa between the modern nation-states of Guinea and Angola. The great plurality were Yoruba, from the area encompassed by the modern states of Nigeria and Benin. Most adhered to a complex system of belief and ritual, now known as Yoruba traditional religion, that had developed among the Yoruba city-states. Much orisha worship was rooted in localised tradition, however certain orisha were worshipped widely, due in part to the extent and influence of the Oyo Empire. Enslaved West Africans brought their traditional religion with them to Cuba. Many Yoruba brought to Cuba were members of the priestly class and brought with them knowledge of traditions such as If√°. These traditions had to adapt to meet the new social conditions of the enslaved population. While hundreds of orisha were worshipped across West Africa, fewer than twenty came to play a prominent role in Santer√≠a; this may be because many or the orisha were rooted in kin-based cults and thus were lost when traditional kinship networks and families were destroyed through enslavement. Oricha were associated with the protection of agriculture also ceased to remain part of practices in Cuba, probably because the enslaved Afro-Cubans had little reason to protect the harvests owned by the slave-owners. Many of the myths associated with the oricha were transformed in Cuba, creating kinship relationships between different oricha which were not present in traditional West African mythologies. Over time, the imported traditional African religions transformed into Santer√≠a, a Cuban tradition that was evident by the end of the 19th century. In Spanish Cuba, Roman Catholicism was the only religion that could be practiced legally. The Roman Catholic Church in Cuba made efforts to convert the enslaved Africans, but the instruction in Roman Catholicism provided to the latter was typically perfunctory and sporadic. Many Spanish slave-owners were uninterested in having their slaves receive Christian instruction, concerned that allowing the slaves to observe religious holidays or Sunday services would be detrimental to productivity. Most Roman Catholic priests were located in urban areas, away from the majority of the enslaved population who worked on rural plantations. In Cuba, traditional African religions continued to be practiced within clubs and fraternal organizations made up of African migrants and their descendants. The most important of these were the cabildos de naci√≥n, associations modelled on Europe's cofradias which were sponsored by the Church and which the establishment regarded as a means of controlling the Afro-Cuban population. These operated as mutual aid societies and organised communal feasts, dances, and carnivals. Cuba's Roman Catholic Church saw these groups as a method for gradual evangelisation, through which they tolerated the practice of some African customs while stamping out those they most fiercely objected to. It was within the cabildos that syncretism between Roman Catholicism and African traditional religions took place, and where Santer√≠a probably first developed. Members identified traditional African deities with Roman Catholic figures such as Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary, and the saints, believing that these entities would assist people in their daily lives in return for offerings. From 1790, Cuba's government increased restrictions on the cabildos. However, during the nineteenth century, their functions and membership expanded. In 1882 a new regulation was passed requiring each cabildo to obtain a new license to operate each year, and in 1884 they were prohibited from practicing on Christmas Eve or January 6. In 1888, the law forbade \\"old style\\" cabildos, after which many of these groups went underground, becoming some of the early casas de santo. Over time, various individuals of non-African descent also converted to Santer√≠a. Formally, these individuals were considered Roman Catholics, but their involvement in Roman Catholicism rarely extended beyond an initial baptism. =After enslavement: 1887‚Äì1959= After slavery was abolished in Cuba there was a renewed push for independence from the Spanish Empire, an idea promoted by Cuban nationalists who emphasized cultural assimilation of the island's various ethnic groups to create a united sense of 'Cuban-ness'. While the country's Creole socio-economic elite sought to fuse different ethnic identities, they still expressed anxieties about the potential Africanisation of Cuba. After independence, Afro-Cubans remained largely excluded from economic and political power, while negative stereotypes about them remained pervasive throughout the Euro-Cuban population. Afro-Cuban religious practices were often referred to as brujer√≠a ('witchcraft') and linked to criminality in the popular imagination. Although religious freedom was enshrined in the Cuban constitution and Santer√≠a was never legislated against, throughout the first half of the 20th century various campaigns were launched against it. In 1876 a law was passed banning the Abaku√° fraternal society, an Afro-Cuban religious group which had become widely associated with criminal activity. These were often encouraged by the press, who promoted allegations that white children were being abducted and murdered in Santer√≠a rituals; this reached a fever pitch in 1904 after two white children were murdered in Havana in cases that investigators speculated were linked to brujer√≠a. The final decades of the 19th century had also seen growing interest in Spiritism, a religion based on the ideas of French writer Allan Kardec, which in Cuba proved particularly popular among the white peasantry, the Creole class, and the small urban middle-class. Ideas from Spiritism increasingly filtered into and influenced Santer√≠a. One of the first intellectuals to examine Santer√≠a was the lawyer and ethnographer Fernando Ortiz, who discussed it in his 1906 book Los negros brujos (The Black Witchdoctors). He saw it as a barrier to the social integration of Afro-Cubans into broader Cuban society and recommended that it be suppressed. In the 1920s, there were efforts to incorporate elements of Afro-Cuban culture into a broader understanding of Cuban culture, such as through the afrocubanismo literary and artistic movement. These often drew upon Afro-Cuban music, dance, and mythology, but typically rejected Santer√≠a rituals themselves. In May 1936, Ortiz sponsored the first ethnographic conference on Santer√≠a music. In 1942, R√≥mula Lachata√±er√©'s Manuel de santer√≠a was published, representing the first scholarly attempt to understand Santer√≠a as a religion; in contrast to Ortiz, he maintained that the tradition should be seen as a religious system as opposed to a form of witchcraft. Lachata√±er√© was instrumental in promoting the term \\"Santer√≠a\\" in reference to the phenomenon, deeming it a more neutral description that the pejorative-laden terms such as brujer√≠a which were commonly used. =In Marxist‚ÄìLeninist Cuba: 1959‚Äìpresent= A statue of Santa Barbara on the wall of a home in Mantilla, Havana; this saint is often linked with the oricha Chango The Cuban Revolution of 1959 resulted in the island becoming a Marxist‚ÄìLeninist state governed by Fidel Castro's Communist Party of Cuba. Much of the Afro-Cuban population was supportive of Castro's new administration, believing that they had the most to gain from the change. This administration espoused an expressly anti-racist position while retaining previous governments' focus on cultural integration rather than stressing and encouraging cultural difference among Cuba's ethnic groups. Castro's government saw any emphasis on a separate Afro-Cuban identity as being counter-revolutionary. Like other Marxist‚ÄìLeninist states, it was committed to state atheism and to the ultimate eradication of religion, resulting in the government taking a negative view of Santer√≠a. Practitioners continued to experience police harassment through to the 1980s, were denied membership of the Communist Party, and faced limited employment opportunities. Santer√≠a practitioners required police permission to perform rituals, permission which was sometimes denied. In 1982, Cuba's government established the Departmento de Estudios Sociorreligiosos (Department of Socio-Religious Studies, DESR), which investigated Santer√≠a from a Marxist perspective, largely portraying the religion as a primitive survival of animism and magic. The DESR research found that while Christianity had declined in Cuba since 1959, Santer√≠a had not. Partly this was because the increased employment among Cubans following the revolution had allowed more individuals to afford the initiation fees. While taking a negative view of Santer√≠a, the state sought to adopt and promote many of the art forms associated with it in the hope of secularizing them and using them in the promotion of a unified Cuban identity. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, at which Cuba lost its main source of international support, Castro's government declared that the country was entering a \\"Special Period\\" in which new economic measures would be necessary. In these years it selectively supported various traditional Afro-Cuban customs and traditions and legalised certain Santer√≠a practices. These measures were partly linked to a desire to boost tourism, with Santer√≠a-focused tourism being called santurismo. Afro-Cuban floor shows became common in Cuban hotels. Priests of Santer√≠a, If√°, and Palo Monte all took part in government-sponsored tours for foreigners desiring initiation into such traditions. In 1991, the Cuban Communist Party approved the admission of religious members, and in 1992 the constitution was amended to declare Cuba a secular rather than an atheist state. The government's move away from the state atheism it previously espoused allowed Santer√≠a to leave behind the marginalisation it had faced, and throughout the 1990s Santer√≠a began to be practiced more openly in Cuba. Growing Yorubization and transnational activity The Cuban Revolution generated an exodus of many Cubans, who settled in other parts of the Americas, especially the United States, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela. Although initial waves of migrants were predominantly white and middle-class, by the Mariel boatlift exodus of the 1980s the migrants included larger numbers of Afro-Cubans. With an increased Cuban presence in the U.S., Santer√≠a began to grow in many large U.S. cities, where it was embraced both by Latino Americans but also European Americans and African Americans. For many African Americans, it was seen as a more authentically African religion than others available to them, especially when purged of European-derived Roman Catholic elements. For some of these individuals, it became a religious wing of the Black Power movement. During the mid-1960s, several African American practitioners established the Yoruba Temple of Harlem. A shop in Havana selling paraphernalia associated with Santer√≠a In the second half of the twentieth century, there was a growing awareness among santeros/santeras of the trans-national links that their religion had with other orisha- worshipping belief systems in West Africa and the Americas. This was accompanied by growing contact with other orisha-worshippers elsewhere. Collectively, these different movements were increasingly described as the \\"Orisha Tradition.\\" This process was partly influenced by the 1957 visit to Cuba of the French photographer and ethnographer Pierre Verger, who promoted a pan-Yoruba theology. These transnational links were reinforced when the Ooni of Ife, a prominent Yoruba political and religious leader, visited Cuba in 1987. Cuba's government permitted the formation of the Yoruba Cultural Association, a non-governmental organization, in the early 1990s. In July 2003, Havana hosted the Eighth World Orisha Conference. Various practitioners of Santer√≠a made visits to Nigeria to study traditional Yoruba religion there. The late twentieth century saw a growth in the yorubizaci√≥n ('Yorubization') of Santer√≠a, with attempts made to remove Roman Catholic elements from the religion and make it more closely resemble West African religion. This process was promoted at the International Workshop of Yoruba Culture, which was held in Cuba in 1992. Within Cuba, the Yorubization process was often attributed as reflecting the influence of practitioners in the United States. Cuban cultural nationalists were critical of the Yorubization process, viewing Santer√≠a's syncretism as a positive trait and arguing that advocates of Yorubization presented homogenous societies as superior to heterogenous ones. Many Santeros who opposed the reforms highlighted that even in West Africa, orisha-worship never foregrounded ideas of purity and exclusivity. The head of the Roman Catholic Church in Cuba, Cardinal Jaime Lucas Ortega y Alamino, also opposed the Yorubization process, believing that the Roman Catholic elements of Santer√≠a were a positive influence within the religion. The close of the twentieth century also saw adherents of Santer√≠a increasingly utilise the internet to promote the religion. Demographics=Cuba= Afro-Cuban drummers in Havana performing a toque based on those found in Santer√≠a Ascertaining the number of Santer√≠a practitioners is complicated by the fact that many individuals do not take part in its rituals but turn to its practitioners for assistance on matters of health and other practical issues. There are divergent opinions regarding how many people practice Afro-Cuban religions on the island. In the 1980s, the secretary-general of the Roman Catholic episcopate, Monsignor Carlos de C√©spedes estimated that about 85 percent of Cubans practiced an Afro-Cuban religion. In 1991, the Cuban anthropologist L√≥pez Vald√©s suggested that about 90 percent of Cuba's population practiced some form of religion and that of that 90 percent, a greater number practiced one of the Afro-Cuban religions than \\"pure Catholicism\\". In 2004, Wedel suggested that practitioners of Santer√≠a \\"greatly outnumber\\" those who practiced Roman Catholicism, Protestantism, or Judaism in Cuba. Estimates have been made that, as of the early 21st century, around 8% of Cubans might be initiates of the religion. Within Cuba, Santer√≠a is practiced in both rural and urban areas and has both Afro-Cuban and Euro-Cuban practitioners. On the island, Santer√≠a is practiced primarily in the north- west provinces of Havana and Matanzas. =Cuban diaspora= Emigration has also ensured that Santer√≠a is now also practiced across most of Latin America, the United States, and also in Europe. Through Cuban emigration to Mexico, Santer√≠a established a presence in Veracruz and Mexico City. Among Mexican practitioners, there is a perception that initiates trained in Cuba were more \\"authentic\\". Mexican practitioners have tried to keep in contact with their Cuban co-religionists via mail and phone. In various cases, initiates have been flown from Cuba to Mexico to perform specific rituals. Cuban emigration also led to Santer√≠a establishing a presence in Puerto Rico and in Spain. Santer√≠a was present in the U.S. by the 1940s; there are reports of people from the U.S. traveling to Cuba for initiation during the 1940s and 1950s. However, Santer√≠a established a larger presence in the United States during the 1960s as growing numbers of Cuban migrants moved there in the wake of the Cuban Revolution. There, it established a particular presence in Florida, California, New Jersey, and New York. In the U.S., it attracted converts from both the African American and Hispanic American communities. Samuel Gregory suggested that in the U.S., Santer√≠a practitioners were more visible than those of Haitian Vodou, in part due to the more insular nature of the Haitian diaspora in the country. He noted that in New York City, the various casas differed in their ethnic makeup, with some houses consisting largely or entirely of Cuban, Puerto Rican, or African American members, and others being highly multi-ethnic. One U.S. Santer√≠a group broke from the mainstream inclusive approaches to the religion by forming the American Yoruba Movement based in North Carolina, which does not accept white initiates. In the mid-1990s, Murphy suggested that there were hundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. who had engaged in Santer√≠a in some form, often as clients. In 2001, there were an estimated 22,000 practitioners in the U.S. Drawing on his research in Cuba during the 1990s, Johan Wedel observed that Santer√≠a was \\"more common in working-class, low-income neighborhoods dominated by Afro- Cubans.\\" Based on his ethnographic work in New York City during the 1980s, Gregory noted that he did not believe Santer√≠a could be seen as a \\"religion of the poor\\", observing a disproportionately high percentage of middle-class people such as teachers, social workers, and artists in the movement. Some practitioners grow up in the religion, as the child of initiates, although others only approach the religion as an adult. Reception=Interest= The interior of the Templo Yemalla, a Santer√≠a temple in Trinidad, Cuba By the late 1980s, Santer√≠a had received considerable interest from social scientists, health professionals, and established churches. Some santeros and santeras have noted that they mistrusted academic researchers, and were thus either vague or deliberately misleading in their answers to the latter's questions. The religion was also explored in other media; the Cuban filmmaker Gloria Rolando released the film Ogg√∫n in 1992. Various songs have also referenced Santer√≠a, in particular the names of various oricha; the successful Cuban American singer Celia Cruz for example recorded a version of \\"Que viva Chango\\" (\\"Long Live Chango\\"), while a popular Cuban band called themselves Los Orichas. Santer√≠a's influence can also be seen in the names of the popular Cuban liquor Santero and the state-owned machete factory Og√∫n. =Opposition= Santer√≠a has often faced opposition. Christian views of the religion have been largely negative, and in Cuba, there has been much opposition from the Roman Catholic clerical establishment over the centuries. When the International Afro-Caribbean Festival in Veracruz was launched in 1994, it showcased art and ritual by Mexican santeros, although this brought public protests from Catholic organisations, who regarded such rites as Satanic, and animal welfare groups who regarded the sacrifices as inhumane. The festival's organisers relented to the pressure, cutting the Santer√≠a elements of the festival by 1998. Various practitioners have also found that their involvement in Santer√≠a has strained their relationship with spouses or other family members who are not involved. Practitioners have also claimed that some santeros and santeras exploit other people financially, particularly those who are sick.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Cincinnati Reds, Cleveland Indians, Colorado Rockies, Atlanta Braves, Texas Rangers, Baltimore Orioles and the San Francisco Giants. Before professional baseball Drew Stubbs graduated from Atlanta High School in 2003. He was a three-time All-American in baseball and two-time academic All-American at the University of Texas. He hit a game-winning triple for Team USA in the gold medal game against Japan at the 2004 FISU II World University Baseball Championship in Taiwan. Stubbs was the Longhorns' co-MVP, named Big 12 co-Player of the Year, and one of five finalists for the Golden Spikes Award in 2006. Professional career=Draft and Minors= Stubbs was the first round pick (8th overall) of the Cincinnati Reds in the 2006 draft. In his 2006 season at the rookie class Billings Mustangs, Stubbs batted .256 with six home runs and 24 RBIs in 56 games, including three triples, in 210 at-bats. Earning a promotion to the Class A Dayton Dragons (the low A team), he batted .270 with 12 home runs, 43 RBIs, and 23 stolen bases in 129 games, including an 11-game hit streak to start the year. His performance earned him a spot in the Midwest League All-Star Game. After the season, he was named the tenth-best prospect in the Midwest League and the fifth-best in the Reds' organization by Baseball America. In the 2008 season Stubbs started with the Single-A Sarasota Reds (the high A team), then was promoted to the Double-A Chattanooga Lookouts, and finally to the Triple-A Louisville Bats. In a combined 131 plate appearances, he batted .277 with 7 home runs, 57 RBIs, and 33 stolen bases. His 33 steals led all Reds minor leaguers. Stubbs represented the U.S. in the 2009 All-Star Futures Game. As of 2009, he was ranked as the Reds' third best prospect behind first baseman Yonder Alonso and shortstop Todd Frazier. =Cincinnati Reds= Stubbs made his Major League debut on August 19, 2009. In his second game, he hit a game-winning home run to beat the San Francisco Giants. He finished the season with a .267 average while hitting eight home runs during the last five-plus weeks of that season. He hit his first career grand slam on April 9, 2010, against the Chicago Cubs. On July 4, 2010, he hit three home runs against the Cubs. On July 24, 2011, Stubbs hit a leadoff walk-off home run on the first pitch from Atlanta Braves reliever Scott Linebrink to give the Reds a 4‚Äì3 win. During the 2011 season, Stubbs had a .243 batting average, 15 homers, and 40 RBI. He led the Major Leagues with number of times striking out, totaling 205 times. He became only the 2nd player to strike out 200 or more times in a season. He was second in the league in stolen bases, with 40. On September 15, 2012, Stubbs was involved in MLB history when his batted groundball was bobbled by Marlins SS Jose Reyes; that would turn out to be MLB's 500,000th error. =Cleveland Indians= Stubbs was traded to the Cleveland Indians, along with Trevor Bauer of the Arizona Diamondbacks in a three-team deal that sent Shin-Soo Choo to the Reds, among other players. On January 17, 2013, Stubbs avoided arbitration with the Indians by signing a one-year, $2.825 million deal with $50,000 in performance bonuses. =Colorado Rockies= On December 18, 2013, Stubbs was traded to the Colorado Rockies for Josh Outman. On August 17, 2014 Stubbs hit a walk-off, three-run home run against Cincinnati Reds pitcher J. J. Hoover, in game one of their double header.

Each rescue squad in the system is housed in a city-owned EMS/Fire station, with the exception of four privately owned rescue stations, including the two owned by VBVRS. Founding The Virginia Beach Volunteer Rescue Squad started in 1952 after attorney J. Peter Holland III came upon a car accident at 24th street and Atlantic Avenue. He was unable to get the victim timely help because the fire department's ambulance was disabled. Holland gathered people in the community to start a volunteer rescue squad. The group took a trip to Fredericksburg, where they already had a working volunteer system. The group went to the city and received $500 to start the rescue squad. On May 1, 1952, Princess Anne- Virginia Beach Rescue started operations. In the 1960s, the city found the need for more rescue squads and requested the new squads operate within the fire departments. Virginia Beach-Princess Anne Rescue opted to remain its own independent squad. This squad is now known as the Virginia Beach Volunteer Rescue Squad or, unofficially, as Rescue 14. In the 1970s, more members were needed and for the first time, women were allowed to volunteer with the rescue squads. Membership There are two types of members in Virginia Beach Volunteer Rescue Squad, with two distinct sets of responsibilities. =Operational= The operational members of VBVRS are Emergency Medical Technicians certified at every level (Basic, Enhanced/Advanced, Intermediate, and Paramedic) and are charged with responding to any medical emergency to which they are dispatched. Members typically staff VBVRS-owned ambulances, but may also staff Department of EMS zone cars depending on certification and citywide needs. Duty Shifts To remain active, operational members must run a minimum of 48 hours of ambulance duty each month. This is generally accomplished via four 12‚Äêhour shifts that run from 6am to 6pm or vice versa, but some members opt to do other shift variations. Members are typically scheduled to run out of a VBVRS station, but ultimately serve the Department of EMS in general and may be sent to any part of Virginia Beach. Standby Events In addition to the mandatory shifts, VBVRS is often contracted to have a medical presence at various events throughout the City of Virginia Beach. These events include everything from races and community outreach events to concerts and exhibitions. Depending on the scale of the event, VBVRS may supply multiple ambulances and coordinate medical coverage across multiple agencies to ensure participant safety. =Support= The role of the support members is, in general, to support the day-to-day running of VBVRS and to meet any needs of the station that arise. Support members often help plan larger VBVRS events, such as the fund-raising Oyster Roast or Fund Drive, but also do much of the behind-the-scenes work that allows VBVRS to run smoothly and efficiently including vehicle coordination, supply management, office management and more. Leadership Organization With over 200 active members, VBVRS has developed a tiered organizational structure to ensure adequate dedication of time to each of the many facets of the organization, both operational and administrative. Executive Committee officers are voted in by the membership, and operational and support officers are appointed by the respective captains. An elected parliamentarian oversees the meetings, and an elected advisory board helps guide the direction of VBVRS. In addition to the positions listed below, sergeants may be appointed to assist with any aspect of VBVRS. =Executive Committee= *Chief *Treasurer *Secretary *Captain of Operations *Captain of Administration *Life Member at Large *Operational Member at Large *Administrative Member at Large =Administrative Officers= *Chaplain *Fund-Drive Chair *Historian *Lieutenant of Information Technology *Lieutenant of Facilities *Lieutenant of Marketing *Lieutenant of Public Relations *Lieutenant of Recruiting *Lieutenant of Retention *Lieutenant of Uniforms =Operational Officers= *Lieutenant of Maintenance *Lieutenant of Scheduling *Lieutenant of Squad Truck *Lieutenant of Supplies *Lieutenant of Training *Lieutenant of Equipment *Sergeant of Equipment 14 *Sergeant of Equipment 8 Stations The current Station 14, the first building opened by VBVRS, located off of Virginia Beach Boulevard in Virginia Beach, VA =Station 14= Since its founding, the Virginia Beach Volunteer Rescue Squad has operated out of a station located adjacent to the Virginia Beach Oceanfront to serve the tourists visiting the city as well as the residents. In November 1995, the Virginia Beach Volunteer Rescue Squad moved from 408 20th Street to 740 Virginia Beach Boulevard. This new state-of-the-art facility provides ample room for equipment, training, sleeping and exercise accommodations for members, as well as meeting rooms used for VBVRS functions and community activities. The garage at Station 14 has 8 bays, which is capable of housing four ambulances, a heavy response truck, the 1972 VBVRS cadillac mainly used in parades, and the various support vehicles. Station 14 also serves as the base for the Department of EMS's Marine Rescue Team, which maintains its primary squad room/bunk room, along with 2 trucks there. =Station 8= Station 8, the second building opened by VBVRS, located off of Old Donation Parkway near Virginia Beach General Hospital in Virginia Beach, VA.In the late 2000s, as a result of private donations, VBVRS was able to finance the building and opening of this substation, Station 8. Like Station 14, Station 8 is a free-standing rescue squad, with all of the amenities included in Station 14. There are six bays in the garage at Station 8, which is capable of holding four ambulances in addition to a rapid response paramedic zone car and a field supervisor vehicle.

The Dulong‚ÄìPetit law, a thermodynamic law proposed in 1819 by French physicists Pierre Louis Dulong and Alexis Th√©r√®se Petit, states the classical expression for the molar specific heat capacity of certain chemical elements. Experimentally the two scientists had found that the heat capacity per weight (the mass-specific heat capacity) for a number of elements was close to a constant value, after it had been multiplied by a number representing the presumed relative atomic weight of the element. These atomic weights had shortly before been suggested by John Dalton and modified by Jacob Berzelius. In modern terms, Dulong and Petit found that the heat capacity of a mole of many solid elements is about 3R, where R is the modern constant called the universal gas constant. Dulong and Petit were unaware of the relationship with R, since this constant had not yet been defined from the later kinetic theory of gases. The value of 3R is about 25 joules per kelvin, and Dulong and Petit essentially found that this was the heat capacity of certain solid elements per mole of atoms they contained. The modern theory of the heat capacity of solids states that it is due to lattice vibrations in the solid and was first derived in crude form from this assumption by Albert Einstein in 1907. The Einstein solid model thus gave for the first time a reason why the Dulong‚ÄìPetit law should be stated in terms of the classical heat capacities for gases. Equivalent forms of statement of the law An equivalent statement of the Dulong‚ÄìPetit law in modern terms is that, regardless of the nature of the substance, the specific heat capacity c of a solid element (measured in joule per kelvin per kilogram) is equal to 3R/M, where R is the gas constant (measured in joule per kelvin per mole) and M is the molar mass (measured in kilogram per mole). Thus, the heat capacity per mole of many elements is 3R. The initial form of the Dulong‚ÄìPetit law was: :cM = K where K is a constant which we know today is about 3R. In modern terms the mass m of the sample divided by molar mass M gives the number of moles n. :m/M = n Therefore, using uppercase C for the full heat capacity (in joule per kelvin), we have: :C(M/m) = C/n = K = 3R or :C/n = 3R. Therefore, the heat capacity of most solid crystalline substances is 3R per mole of substance. Dulong and Petit did not state their law in terms of the gas constant R (which was not then known). Instead, they measured the values of heat capacities (per weight) of substances and found them smaller for substances of greater atomic weight as inferred by Dalton and other early atomists. Dulong and Petit then found that when multiplied by these atomic weights, the value for the heat capacity per mole was nearly constant, and equal to a value which was later recognized to be 3R. In other modern terminology, the dimensionless heat capacity (C/NR) is equal to 3. The law can also be written as a function of the total number of atoms N in the sample: :C/N = 3k_{\\\\rm B}, where kB is Boltzmann constant. Application limits The molar heat capacity plotted of most elements at 25¬∞C plotted as a function of atomic number. The value of bromine is for the gaseous state. For iodine, a value for the gas and one for the solid is shown. Despite its simplicity, Dulong‚ÄìPetit law offers fairly good prediction for the heat capacity of many elementary solids with relatively simple crystal structure at high temperatures. This agreement is because in the classical statistical theory of Ludwig Boltzmann, the heat capacity of solids approaches a maximum of 3R per mole of atoms because full vibrational-mode degrees of freedom amount to 3 degrees of freedom per atom, each corresponding to a quadratic kinetic energy term and a quadratic potential energy term. By the equipartition theorem, the average of each quadratic term is kBT, or RT per mole (see derivation below). Multiplied by 3 degrees of freedom and the two terms per degree of freedom, this amounts to 3R per mole heat capacity. The Dulong-Petit law fails at room temperatures for light atoms bonded strongly to each other, such as in metallic beryllium and in carbon as diamond. Here, it predicts higher heat capacities than are actually found, with the difference due to higher-energy vibrational modes not being populated at room temperatures in these substances. In the very low (cryogenic) temperature region, where the quantum mechanical nature of energy storage in all solids manifests itself with larger and larger effect, the law fails for all substances. For crystals under such conditions, the Debye model, an extension of the Einstein theory that accounts for statistical distributions in atomic vibration when there are lower amounts of energy to distribute, works well. Derivation for an Einstein solid A system of vibrations in a crystalline solid lattice can be modelled as an Einstein solid, i.e. by considering N quantum harmonic oscillator potentials along each degree of freedom. Then, the free energy of the system can be written as :F=N\\\\varepsilon_0+Nk_{\\\\rm B}T\\\\sum_\\\\alpha \\\\log\\\\left(1-e^{-\\\\hbar\\\\omega_{\\\\alpha}/k_{\\\\rm B}T}\\\\right) where the index Œ± sums over all the degrees of freedom. In the 1907 Einstein model (as opposed to the later Debye model) we consider only the high-energy limit: :k_{\\\\rm B}T\\\\gg\\\\hbar\\\\omega_\\\\alpha. \\\\, Then :1-e^{-\\\\hbar\\\\omega_\\\\alpha/k_{\\\\rm B}T} \\\\approx \\\\hbar\\\\omega_\\\\alpha/k_{\\\\rm B}T \\\\, and we have :F=N\\\\varepsilon_0+Nk_{\\\\rm B}T\\\\sum_{\\\\alpha}\\\\log\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\hbar\\\\omega_{\\\\alpha}}{k_{\\\\rm B}T}\\\\right). Define geometric mean frequency by :\\\\log\\\\bar{\\\\omega}=\\\\frac{1}{g}\\\\sum_\\\\alpha \\\\log\\\\omega_\\\\alpha, where g measures the total number of spatial degrees of freedom of the system. Thus we have :F=N\\\\varepsilon_0-gNk_{\\\\rm B}T\\\\log k_{\\\\rm B}T+gNk_{\\\\rm B}T\\\\log\\\\hbar\\\\bar{\\\\omega}. \\\\, Using energy : E=F-T\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial T}\\\\right)_V, we have :E=N\\\\varepsilon_0+gNk_{\\\\rm B}T. \\\\, This gives heat capacity at constant volume :C_V=\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial E}{\\\\partial T}\\\\right)_V=gNk_{\\\\rm B}, which is independent of the temperature.

He collaborated closely with his younger brother Julio Irazusta throughout his career. Right-wing politics Irazusta was born close to the Rinc√≥n del Cura area of Gualeguaych√∫, Entre R√≠os into a family noted for its support of radical politics.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, Simon & Schuster, 1990, p. 195 Irazusta first came to prominence through his association with the journal La Nueva Republica (LNR), of which he became editor soon after its establishment. It was founded in 1927 by the followers of the ideas of Leopoldo Lugones and was edited by the likes of Juan Carulla as well as the Irazusta brothers.Roger Griffin & Matthew Feldman, Fascism: The \\"Fascist Epoch\\", 2004, p. 353 The aim of LNR was to take the ruling classes away from the prevailing liberalism of the time to more counterrevolutionary, Maurrasian ideals.Sandra McGee Deutsch, Las Derechas, 1999, p. 197 LNR endorsed corporatism and represented a move away from the traditionalism that had tended to be the hallmark of right wing critics of the system in Argentina to a new, hard-line nationalism.Michael A. Burdick, For God and the Fatherland, 1995, p. 30 Irazusta was particularly noted as a harsh critic of democracy and he wrote that as a concept it was not in the Constitution and that it led to disorder. He further argued that democracy encouraged the growth of parasitic administrators and well as too much influence from foreign-owned businesses.Sandra McGee Deutsch, Las Derechas, 1999, p. 203 Further he denounced it as being anti-Catholic and thus incompatible with the central role that he felt the Catholic Church should hold in Argentina.F. Finchelstein, The Ideological Origins of the Dirty War: Fascism, Populism, and Dictatorship in Twentieth Century Argentina, Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 23 As representatives of the semi-fascist right Irazusta and Carulla approached General Jos√© F√©lix Uriburu in 1927 to ask him to lead a coup against the presidency of Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen but he declined. Despite the setback, Irazusta joined with Roberto de Laferr√®re to create the Liga Republicana (Republican League), a fascistic anti-government youth militia.Sandra McGee Deutsch, Las Derechas, 1999, p. 198 Ultimately Uriburu did lead a coup in 1930 after his retirement from the army and the Irazustas enjoyed high profiles during his government. Indeed they were part of an intellectual movement along with the likes of Carulla, Ernesto Palacio and Bruno Jacovella who wrote in favour of a corporatist, Maurrasian system and so became the ideologues of the Uriburu regime.Cyprian Blamires, World Fascism, 2006, p. 56 Irazusta brothers The Irazustas continued to write prolifically, contributing widely to LNR as well as to the journal Voz del Pueblo which was pro-Nazi in outlook.Bryce Wood, The dismantling of the good neighbor policy, 1985, p. 220 From 1931 they worked together closely on the journal Acci√≥n Republicana and in this developed a strong nativist line in which they argued against foreign economic involvement in Argentina and the liberalism that they believed this engendered. The brothers endorsed etatism and a strong governmental role in economic, political and cultural life, advocating some nationalisation, economic modernisation and in increasing emphasis on militarism in the education system. In 1940 they established a further journal, Nuevo Orden, to disseminate their political views. The brothers' best-known work was their 1934 book Argentina y el imperialismo brit√°nico: Los eslabones de una cadena, 1806-1833 which accused the United Kingdom, which had supported Argentina in its attempts to gain independence from Spain, of doing so for ulterior motives i.e. opening up new trade markets and ensuring that the newly independent state would have to rely on them for loans. The book was central to their nationalist, corporatist vision, although it has subsequently become a standard for both left and right.Nicolas Shumway, The invention of Argentina, 1993, p. 156 It also played a pivotal role in the development of Argentine claims to the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands by suggesting that taking the Falkland Islands was one of the ways in which the UK had exploited Argentina.Lowell S. Gustafson, The sovereignty dispute over the Falkland (Malvinas) Islands, 1988, p. 57 Later years Following the emergence of Juan Per√≥n as President the brothers became involved in the Partido Libertador. The group was initially cautiously pro-Per√≥n but shifted their opinion to one of opposition, accusing Peronism of embracing socialism at the expense of nationalism.Rees, Biographical Dictionary, pp. 195-196 Irazusta's 1956 work, Per√≥n y la crisis argentina, was a diatribe against Per√≥n, accusing him of breaking with Argentine political traditions by following a pro-British policy.Rees, Biographical Dictionary, p. 196 With Julio he established another political party, the Republican Union, in 1955 but this made little headway, with Julio retiring from politics soon after its formation.

He collaborated closely with his older brother Rodolfo Irazusta throughout his career. Early years Irazusta was born close to the Rincon del Cura area of Gualeguaych√∫, Entre R√≠os into a family noted for its support of radical politics. He attended the University of Buenos Aires - graduating in 1922 with a law degree - and around this time he was noted as a supporter of the Radical Civic Union. As a student he edited the literary journal Revista Nacional from 1981 to 1920, collaborating with Ernesto Palacio, who at the time held leftist views. Both men came under the influence of the Spanish rightist Ramiro de Maeztu although Irazusta balanced this by also following the writings of Italian liberal Benedetto Croce.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, Simon & Schuster, 1990, p. 195 Move to the right From 1923 to 1927 Irazusta travelled extensively in western Europe. During his time in the United Kingdom he studied Latin and philosophy at Balliol College, Oxford. He also spent time in France where his move towards right-wing politics grew rapidly. Whilst here he met Action Fran√ßaise leader Charles Maurras and became attracted to the brand of integral nationalism that Maurras endorsed. His last major port of call in Europe was Italy where he observed fascism first hand and was attracted by the ideology. On his return to Argentina he resumed his association with Palacio, who was himself on the far right by that point, with the pair collaborating on the Catholic journal Criterio along with Jorge Luis Borges, who only contributed some apolitical poems and did not share their politics, withdrawing from the journal once their support for fascism and Uriburu's coup became more evident. Irazusta criticised democracy and was especially opposed to freedom of religion, arguing that it was part of an anti-Catholic conspiracy designed to promote Protestantism.F. Finchelstein, The Ideological Origins of the Dirty War: Fascism, Populism, and Dictatorship in Twentieth Century Argentina, Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 22 Such was his opposition to socialism that he argued a civil war would be preferable to a left-wing government in Argentina.Finchelstein, The Ideological Origins of the Dirty War, p. 23 In 1929 he joined his brother, Palacio and Juan Carulla in establishing the Liga Republicana, a group that sought the establishment of an authoritarian conservative regime under the leadership of military strongman General Jos√© F√©lix Uriburu. For his part however Irazusta was less enthusiastic about Uriburu than his fellow leaders and he left Argentina in 1930 to return to Europe, missing Uriburu's coup later that same year. Irazusta brothers Upon his return to Argentina in 1931 Julio Irazusta worked closely with his brother Rodolfo as the two sought to develop an Argentine native form of fascism. They worked together closely on the journal Accion Republicana and in this developed a strong nativist line in which they argued against foreign economic involvement in Argentina and the liberalism that they believed this engendered. They came to endorse etatism and a strong governmental role in economic, political and cultural life, advocating some nationalisation, economic modernisation and in increasing emphasis on militarism in the education system. They also contributed widely to LNR was well as the journal Voz del Pueblo which was pro-Nazi in outlook.Bryce Wood, The dismantling of the good neighbor policy, 1985, p. 220 He was an admirer of Adolf Hitler, describing him as \\"an eminently sensible man, the complete opposite of the intolerant and presumptuous megalomaniac that his detractors paint him as\\".Finchelstein, The Ideological Origins of the Dirty War, p. 37 The brothers best known work was their 1934 book Argentina y el imperialismo brit√°nico: Los eslabones de una cadena 1806-1833 which accused the United Kingdom, which had supported Argentina in its attempts to gain independence from Spain, of doing so for ulterior motives i.e. opening up new trade markets and ensuring that the newly independent state would have to rely on them for loans.

Gustafson, The sovereignty dispute over the Falkland (Malvinas) Islands, 1988, p. 57 Rosas scholarship Becoming more involved in academic scholarship after 1935, Julio Irazusta wrote and lectured extensively on Juan Manuel de Rosas who was the subject of revisionism from the far right from 1930, when a hagiographical biography by Carlos Ibarguren appeared, resulting in Rosas being characterised as a model of leadership.Sandra McGee Deutsch, Las Derechas, 1999, pp. 233 Irazusta believed that Rosas was the last great Argentine statesman and he became noted as an expert on Rosas, editing four volumes of his political papers between 1941 and 1950. Irazusta also wrote biographies of Tom√°s de Anchorena and other historical figuresNicolas Shumway, The invention of Argentina, 1993, p. 26 whilst in 1940 he established a new journal, Nuevo Orden, with his brother. Later years Irazusta became involved in the Partido de Uni√≥n Republicana and served this party as a deputy from 1939 to 1945. Following the emergence of Juan Peron as president the brothers became involved in the Partido Libertador.

She was invited to work for a modelling agency for the first time at age 12, but her parents refused to give their permission, because they felt she was too young for the fashion world at the time. During adolescence, she suffered discrimination for being tall and lean. After finishing high school and studying law for a year, Vieira went to work for a small mining company. During a conversation with friends, Ma√≠ra was told of the casting of Channel Sony¬¥s reality show, Brazil's Next Top Model.

In the first part of the show, Vieira was criticized for her lack of presence in photos. But in week 6, she had the best photo of the week, and continued to do well from then on. In the 11th week, her potential was assessmed during a trip to the Buenos Aires Fashion Week. Despite receiving praise from booker Gabriela Vidal and designer Pablo Ramirez, she ended in the bottom two for the first time, along with candidate Priscila Mallmann, but was saved from elimination. In the final episode, she was potted against √âlly Rosa. Rosa had the better catwalk, but Vieira's improvement, good personality, good photos, and high fashion looks resulted in her being crowned as the eventual victor. Later career As part of her prize, Ma√≠ra had her portfolio made available on the official website Ford of Minas Gerais from December 2008. She was also featured in an editorial in Vogue Brazil, and, within six months of her victory, had worked for major brands and designers, including Rosa Ch√°, Carlos Mielle, and Jo De Mer.

Plot The year is 1853 when inveterate gambler Jim Smiley (Edgar Buchanan) returns to his hometown of Dawson's Landing in Missouri after being away for a decade from his wife and son. He brings a jumping frog which he calls Daniel Webster with him, and immediately upon his arrival to the town hotel makes a bet with Sheriff Dingle (Stanley Andrews) and a few others, that the frog can jump when told to do so. He wins the bet and is able to pay for his stay at the hotel with the money. Next he visits his wife Nancy (Anna Lee), who turns out to be his ex-wife and is about to marry the town judge, Leonidas K. Carter (Robert Shayne). He still gets to meet his son, Bob (Gary Gray), who he has never met before. To make amends and win the boy's heart, he intends to buy him a racing Greyhound. Jim manages to gather a sum of $300 to buy a certain dog that Bob has set his eyes on, Andrew Jackson III, and Bob trains it to race it in an upcoming contest. But Bob is made fun of by one of the judge's own spoiled sons, Monty (Bill Sheffield), and Jim becomes determined to win back both his son and his wife from the snobby Leonidas. Jim begins by renouncing gambling altogether and getting a job at the local hotel. He relapses however, by placing a bet on the judge's prize runner to win the race. Instead Bob's dog wins the race, and Jim feels guilty over having lied to Nancy and let his son down by not believing in him. Since Nancy believes he is a reformed man she agrees to marry him again. When the wedding day comes, Jim still feels bad about his lies, when he discovers that Bob and Monty are betting. He tries to teach his son about the perils of gambling, but his guilty conscience makes him cancel the wedding. The judge also tries to stop the wedding by challenging Jim's ability to pay for the ceremony, which costs about $1,000. The challenge turns into a bet, where Jim stakes $1,000 that his frog will beat his friend Amos' (Hobart Cavanaugh) leaper, Martha Washington. Jim goes on to fix the race, but refuses to accept his prize money when he wins. In doing so, he restores his dignity in front of Nancy. Jim layer confesses to Nancy about the bet on the previous dog race, but she is still happy about his new honest behaviour and agrees to remarry him anyway.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/68495/Best-Man-Wins/ Cast * Edgar Buchanan as Jim Smiley * Anna Lee as Nancy Smiley * Robert Shayne as Judge Leonidas K.

It is notable for its showy orange, red or purple flowers, unusual foliage and fruit, and is a popular garden plant. It is a member of Melaleuca, a large and diverse genus whose members range from large trees such as M. quinquenervia, to small shrubs. Description Melaleuca fulgens is a woody shrub growing to a height of with glabrous branchlets. Its leaves are arranged in alternating pairs at right angles to those immediately above and below (decussate) so that the leaves are in four rows along the stems. The leaves are grey-green, long, wide, varying in shape depending on subspecies but generally linear to egg-shaped. The flowers are a shade of red, pink or white and are arranged in spikes on the sides of the branches. The spikes are up to in diameter and contain 6 to 20 individual flowers arranged in a decussate pattern. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower, each bundle at least long and containing 22 to 80 stamens. The flowers appear from late winter to summer (July to December) and are followed by fruit which are woody capsules long, shaped like a squashed urn and arranged in alternating pairs along the stems. Tardun M. fulgens fruit Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca fulgens was one of the many species first formally described by the botanist Robert Brown, appearing in Hortus Kewensis in 1812. The specific epithet (fulgens) is derived from a Latin adjective meaning \\"bright-coloured\\" or \\"shining\\" and is related to the showy flowers. Three subspecies are recognised, differentiated mainly by the length of their stamen filaments and from their distributions: * M. fulgens R.Br. subsp. fulgens occurs in many areas of the south west of the state, has linear to narrow elliptic leaves and stamen filaments long; * Melaleuca fulgens subsp. steedmanii (C.A.Gardner) K.J.Cowley has a more restricted distribution in and between the Shark Bay and Coorow districts near Geraldton, has narrow egg-shaped leaves and stamen filaments long; * Melaleuca fulgens subsp. corrugata (J.M.Black ex Eardley) K.J.Cowley has a disjunct distribution in the border area between Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory. Distribution and habitat This melaleuca is found in a broad area across Western Australia, from Kalbarri to the vicinity of Kalgoorlie, south to the southern coastline and in the border areas with South Australia and the Northern Territory, growing on sandy or gravelly soils, often on granite outcrops. Conservation status Melaleuca fulgens is listed as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture Melaleuca fulgens was introduced into cultivation in the United Kingdom in 1803 and is commonly grown in Australian gardens, with several hybrids also available. It is readily grown given sufficient moisture but needs good drainage as it is susceptible to fungal disease. Its attractive grey foliage and bright showy flowers are its horticultural features. Light pruning improves flowering and improves the shrub's shape. Plants may be propagated from seed, though propagation from semi-mature cuttings is preferred for cultivars to preserve flower colour and form. One attractive form has apricot-coloured flowers.

Description Grevillea iaspicula is a shrub that grows to a height of and has leaves that are between long with have recurved margins. The branched, pendant inflorescences appear from late autumn to late spring. The perianths are green or cream coloured, flushed with light pink and the styles are pink or red. The fruit is a hairy follicle. Taxonomy Grevillea iaspicula was first formally described in 1986 by Donald McGillivray in his book, New Names in Grevillea (Proteaceae). The type specimen was found on private property in Wee Jasper in 1980. The specific epithet iaspicula is a latinised form of Wee jasper, the area where this species occurs. In the Flora of Australia (1999), the species was positioned within the genus Grevillea by means of a hierarchical tree as follows: Grevillea (genus) :Floribunda Group ::Rosmarinifolia Subgroup :::Grevillea iaspicula :::Grevillea jephcottii :::Grevillea lanigera :::Grevillea baueri :::Grevillea rosmarinifolia :::Grevillea divaricata Distribution Grevillea iaspicula occurs in a restricted area in Wee Jasper and near Lake Burrinjuck among limestone-based rocky outcrops. Many populations are on private land. Ecology The species is believed to be pollinated by birds. Conservation status Grevillea iaspicula is listed as \\"critically endangered\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and \\"endangered\\" under the New South Wales Government Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995. Potential threats include grazing, weeds, fire and drought. It is believed that survival of the species in the wild is unlikely without human intervention to artificially increase populations. Use in horticulture The species has only been brought in to cultivation in recent times and plants are not yet widely available beyond specialist nurseries. It exhibits a number of qualities which make it a suitable candidate for many gardens including adaptibility to a range of soil types, responsiveness to pruning, and resistance to heavy frost. Plants may be propagated from cuttings.

Taxonomy First collected in 1886 from the vicinity of the Johnstone River in north Queensland, this species was given the binomial name Kermadecia pinnatifida by Queensland botanist Frederick Manson Bailey. However, when it was reclassified within the genus Grevillea, the new scientific name was found to be an illegitimate name as the combination Grevillea pinnatifida had been published for a different plant in 1843. Instead, botanist Donald McGillivray gave it the new name Grevillea baileyana in 1986, honouring Bailey and his son John Frederick Bailey. Common names include scrub beefwood, white oak and brown silky oak. However it is not closely related to the European genus of oaks, Quercus, nor does it resemble them. Description In its native rainforest habitat, Grevillea baileyana can grow as a tree to 30 m (100 ft) high. Its hard scaly bark is grey. Both adult and juvenile leaves are 6‚Äì30 cm (5.2‚Äì12 in) long; the juvenile leaves are pinnatifid, that is, divided into five to nine lanceolate (spear-shaped) lobes on each side of the leaf, while the adult leaves are a simple spear- shape (lanceolate) and 1‚Äì6 or rarely 10 cm (0.4‚Äì4 in) wide. They are a shiny smooth green above with a conspicuous midvein, and covered in rust-coloured fur below. The flowerheads appear in spring and summer (August to December) and are greenish in bud and white on maturity. Distribution and habitat Grevillea baileyana is found in New Guinea and Australia, where it occurs in northeastern Queensland in the McIlwraith Range and vicinity of Coen, and from Cooktown south to Ingham. It is found in rainforests and rainforest margins, generally on granite-based soils. Cultivation and uses The fragrant white flowerheads and green foliage make Grevillea baileyana an attractive garden plant. It prefers a compost-rich, acidic soil with good drainage. It is long- lived in cultivation and usually grows no higher than 8 to 10 metres (25‚Äì35 ft). Although noted for prolific flowering in tropical regions, plants may take many years to produce flowers in temperate areas. It is generally propagated by seed, although some success has been had with cuttings. The white or pinkish grained wood can be used in wood turning or cabinet making. Foliage of the species is valued in floral arrangements for the unusual contrast of the dark green upper surface and gold to bronze underside. The species was one of 5 selected for trialling as \\"native foliage products\\" from a total of 21 based on an evaluation of vase life, adaptability to varied climates and market acceptance. It was incorporated in the bouquets handed to medal winners at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney.

He was most prominent under the military regime in power during the early 1930s. In France A native of the Entre R√≠os Province, Carulla trained as a medical doctor.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, Simon & Schuster, 1990, p. 55 In his early years Carulla was a supporter of anarchism but this changed after a trip to Europe during the First World War. Carulla enlisted in the French Army as a field doctor and became convinced that the left had done nothing to help the war effort.Sandra McGee Deutsch, Las Derechas, 1999, pp. 195-6 Whilst in France he became a strong supporter of Action Fran√ßaise.Roger Griffin & Matthew Feldman, Fascism: The \\"Fascist Epoch\\", 2004, p. 353 Like many of his contemporaries in France, Carulla had been exposed to the syndicalism of Georges Sorel which, despite its avowedly leftist bent, was influential on the integrism of Charles Maurras with a number of French leftists of the time switching to this far right creed. Argentine far-right Following his return to Argentina, Carulla established his own journal, La Voz Nacional, in 1925. He showed strong support for Germany and a preference for tradition and heredity as the bases of government. He became associated with the followers of Leopoldo Lugones and, along with Rodolfo Irazusta, helped to found and edit the journal La Nueva Rep√∫blica (LNR) in 1927. He also produced his own journal Bandera Argentina which campaigned strongly against female suffrage, dismissing it as \\"insanity\\".Sandra McGee Deutsch, Las Derechas, 1999, pp. 235-6 This journal contained the writings in which Carulla came closest to endorsing the fascism that was growing in Europe at the time. In his memoirs he admitted that this journal had received assistance from the German embassy.Graciela Ben-Dror, The Catholic Church and the Jews, 2009, p. 87 His work with LNR was pivotal to the development of Argentina's anti-establishment far right as it represented a break from the old traditionalism and a new endorsement of corporatism and a fascist-inspired nationalism.Michael A. Burdick, For God and the Fatherland, 1995, p. 30 In his work for the magazine Carulla emphasised anti-Semitism and wrote of perceived Jewish conspiracies to take over Argentina.F. Finchelstein, The Ideological Origins of the Dirty War: Fascism, Populism, and Dictatorship in Twentieth Century Argentina, Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 59 Along with Julio Irazusta, Carulla asked right- wing General Jos√© F√©lix Uriburu to lead a coup against the liberal government of Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen in 1927. The general declined at that stage but did so in 1930, forming a new right-wing dictatorship in which Carulla enjoyed influence.Sandra McGee Deutsch, Las Derechas, 1999, p. 197 He was to form part of the Maurras-inspired elite, alongside the Irazusta brothers, Ernesto Palacio, Bruno Jacovella and others, who took up their pens in defence of the new regime and effectively supplied it with an ideology.Cyprian Blamires, World Fascism, 2006, p. 56 Cerulla in particular enjoyed strong influence and it was he who was behind the idea of merging all Uriburu's supporters into one militia group, the Argentine Civic Legion, under the general's government, a move that was seen as pivotal in the fascistisation of the Uriburu regime.Robert A. Potash, The Army & Politics in Argentina: 1928-1945, 1969, p. 67 He was also involved in a number of rightist groups, all of which were pro- Uriburu, including the Republican League, a group patterned after Action Fran√ßaise, the National Party established by Alberto Vi√±as and Carlos Silveyra in 1930, and the Agrupaci√≥n Teniente General Uriburu set up in 1932. Later writing He was strongly interested in the cultural implications of the Spanish language, and in his book Genio de la Argentina (1943) he wrote that the common language formed a strong basis for close links with Spain, thus endorsing the Hispanidad ideas championed by Manuel G√°lvez.C.L. Callahan, The Impact of the Spanish Civil War on Argentine Nationalist Intellectual Thought He was also a harsh critic of democracy, arguing that it was a product of the French Revolution that was alien and irrelevant to Hispanic countries, which, he contended, required authoritarian governments. He further believed in the importance of the family and looked to Francisco Franco in his desire to establish a \\"juvenile Falange\\" in which young men would be organised at the disposal of the government. Carulla abandoned his fascist sympathies in the late 1940s and played little role in public life thereafter. His autobiography, Al Filo del Medio Siglo, was published in 1951.

The PSC aims to protect the integrity of hiring and promotion within the public service. As well, the Commission works to protect the political impartiality and non- partisanship of public servants. The Commission develops staffing policies and provides guidance to public service managers and recruits Canadians into the public service. To ensure the staffing system in the government is properly maintained, the PSC has the authority to audit and investigate to ensure departments and managers make improvements. While typical government departments are headed by Ministers, the PSC is an independent agency that is headed by a President (currently Patrick Borbey) who reports to the Canadian Parliament. Mandate and goals The PSC has the mandate to appoint people to the public service, and to promote people within the government which can in turn be delegated to deputy heads (often referred to as Deputy Ministers in Canada). The PSC can also assist government departments with recruitment and assessment services. The PSC oversees the integrity of the hiring and promotion system, and makes sure that the hiring process is not compromised by partisan interference from elected officials. Part of this overseeing role involves collecting and analyzing data on hiring and promotion in the public service (e.g., hiring of different groups, by region, by department). As well, the PSC performs audits across the staffing system, examining hiring and promotion files, to ensure that employees are hired and promoted based on merit. Lastly, the PSC administers the Part VII of Public Service Employment Act that recognizes the rights of public service employees to engage in political activities while maintaining the principle of political impartiallity in the public service. The mission of the PSC is to achieve \\"A highly competent, non-partisan and representative Public Service, able to provide services in both official languages and in which employment practices are characterized by fairness, access, representativeness and transparency Program activities The PSC has set out four program activities that are done to reach its strategic outcome: *The Appointment Integrity and Political Neutrality activity (policies and standards on safeguarding the integrity of hiring and promotion and political neutrality issues) *The Oversight of Integrity of Staffing and Political Neutrality (makes sure that the integrity of public service hiring and promotion is protected and safeguards the political neutrality of public servants) *The Staffing Services and Assessment activity (provides managers with tools to help them assess and select employment applicants). *The Internal Services program activity (corporate management and planning frameworks for the Management Accountability Framework, finance, internal staff, information technology, communications, and other administrative and general support). Public Service Employment Act The 2003 Public Service Employment Act (which came into force on December 31, 2005) emphasizes the values of merit, non-partisanship, fairness, access, transparency and representativeness. Merit refers to the use of essential qualifications during the hiring and promotion process. This means that people who are hired and promoted in the public service must possess certain competencies, skills, and experience (merit), rather than based on political connections or partisan affiliations (political patronage). The merit principle requires that every person who is appointed to the public service has met the essential qualifications and requirements established for the position. The essential requirements can include official language proficiency, asset qualifications, operational requirements (e.g., availability to do shift work or work on weekends), and organizational needs (e.g., need to increase the hiring of women) that have been identified by the head of a department or agency. Non-partisanship means that appointments of people to the public service (and promotions of public servants )have to be made without political influence from Ministers or partisan officials. Although Canadian public servants were disallowed any involvement in political activities in their private time throughout much of the 20th century, in 1967, legislative changes allowed public servants to request permission to take leave without pay to run in an election. In 1991, a Supreme Court decision gave public servants the right to engage in political activities. The 2003 Public Service Employment Act clarified what political activities public servants are allowed to engage in. Public servants can engage in political activities such as supporting a candidate in an election or taking leave without pay to run in an election, but they have to maintain their political impartiality as public servants. In order to comply with the non-partisanship values in the Act, public servants must only do the types of political activities that do not conflict or impair their ability to fulfill their responsibilities in a politically impartial manner. The type and degree of political activities that a public servant can engage in depends on several factors, such as the visibility of the political activities that the public servant wants to engage in and the visibility of the public servant in their job in the public service. Historical timeline * Before responsible government, Canada had no real civil service; government officials were appointed by either the Crown or its provincial representatives. These officials usually served for an unspecified period (\\"during the pleasure of the Crown\\") for as long as they were deemed fit for the position. * 1849 - when responsible government began in 1849, there was a recognition that the roles of the political and non-political government officials needed to be defined and distinguished from one another. * 1868 - the Canada Civil Service Act was enacted * The \\"Civil Service Act\\" of 1882 created a process for examining candidates for the civil service, with a Board of Civil Service Examiners * 1908 - the Civil Service Amendment Act created the Civil Service Commission, an independent body to oversee appointments to government positions in Ottawa (this was called the \\"inside service\\", in contrast to the public service outside the capital). * The Civil Service Act 1918 set in place merit-based appointments and reinforced the independence of the Commission. It also brought the \\"outside service\\" (the public service outside of Ottawa) under the domain of the Commission, along with greater oversight with regards to appointments and promotions for members of the \\"inside service\\".Roberts, Alasdair. So-Called Experts: How American Consultants Remade the Canadian Civil Service, 1918-1921. Institute of Public Administration of Canada, 1996 * 1920s - the Commission developed its competitive system of examinations for appointment and promotion (a merit system) as a viable alternative to the patronage system. * 1921 - formal restrictions were placed against the employment of married women. Women already holding permanent positions who married had to resign. These restrictions were not removed until 1955. * 1924 - The Civil Service Superannuation Act was intended to promote and protect a career civil service. * 1932 - staff control regulations are established and Treasury Board is given authority over the Civil Service Commission's staffing responsibilities. * 1949 - the number of World War II veterans assigned to positions in the civil service under the statutory veterans preference rises to 55,000. * 1951 - The Financial Administration Act of 1951 provided final authority to the Treasury Board for management (administration and organization) of the public service. * 1957 - The CSC establishes the Pay Research Bureau to provide objective information on rates of pay and conditions of employment in government and industry, and to recommend salary rates for civil servants. * 1961 - The new Civil Service Act of 1961 gave civil servants the right of appeal against not only promotions, but also transfers, demotions, suspensions and dismissals. * 1962 - The Government adopted recommendations by the Royal Commission on Government Organization (Glassco Commission) on the management of the Public Service, including delegating authority to departments to manage their own personnel and to be held accountable for efficient performance. * 1966 - Bilingualism becomes an element of merit in the national capital area. * 1967 - Public Service Employment Act (PSEA) and Public Service Staff Relations Act (PSSRA) come into effect. The PSEA gave the renamed Public Service Commission the responsibility for all the elements of the staffing process. The PSSRA created a collective bargaining regime in the civil service. * early 1970s - rapid expansion of the public service. * Late 1970s - significant reduction of public service. * 1979 - The Bilingualism Bonus was introduced for public servants who met the bilingual language requirements of their positions. * 1984 - the Commission on Equality in Employment issued its report, which recommended that targets and not quotas are the most effective means of achieving equity in the employment of members of under-represented groups. * 1986 - further employment layoff programs again reduce the public service. * 1992 - Public Service Reform Act amends both the PSEA and the Public Service Staff Relations Act. This provides more flexibility for managers to respond quickly to changing operational needs or to allow employees to acquire new skills. The Act also enabled the PSC to prescribe standards of competence to measure merit. * 1995 - a restraint- focused federal budget leads to further reductions in the size of the civil service. * Late 1990s and early 2000s - rapid growth of the public service * 2003 - a new Public Service Employment Act, which created the first legislative definition of merit (it also redefined merit) Chairpersons and Presidents *Patrick Borbey (2017‚Äìpresent) *Gerry Thom (acting, 2017) *Christine Donoghue (acting, 2015‚Äì2017) *Anne-Marie Robinson (2012‚Äì2016) *Maria Barrados (2003‚Äì2012) *Scott Serson (1999‚Äì2003) *Ruth Hubbard (1994‚Äì1999) *Robert J.

He was the eighth of nine children of the peddler from Renaix, Pierre Fran√ßois Meerschaert, and his wife from Russeignies, Marie Ther√®se Gabreau. Th√©ophile Meerscheart, Birth Certificate No. 12, filed 24 August 1847, Register of Births for the Year 1862, Russeignies, East Flanders, Belgium; in: FamilySearch, \\"Belgium, Hainaut, Civil Registration,, 1600‚Äì1911\\"; Russeignies, Geboorten, huwelijken, overladen [Dutch, \\"Births, Marriages, Deaths\\"] 1811‚Äì1870; Image 496, Left Page, Item 3. The titles and columns were in Dutch but the actual birth certificate was in French. In 1847, Russeignies still belonged to the province of East Flanders. It did not switch to the province of Hainaut until 1963. See \\"Historie de la commune\\", Belgique ‚Äì Russeignies (Rozenaken), at Geneawiki for more details. After studying at the College of Renaix (1859‚Äì1864) and the College of Audenarde (1864‚Äì1868), he entered the American College of Louvain in 1868, having been moved by word of the needs and opportunities in the American missions. Ordination and ministry Meerschaert was ordained to the priesthood on 23 December 1871 in Mechelen, Belgium. He left for the United States in September 1872, arriving at Natchez, Mississippi in the following October. For the next 19 years he labored among the difficult circumstances of the Southern Reconstruction. He was appointed to Hancock and Harrison Counties in November 1872, and transferred to Ocean Springs in August 1874. In October 1875, Meerschaert was felled by yellow fever and his case thought hopeless, but he eventually recovered. He worked in Bay St. Louis for a year before returning to Natchez in August 1880. He became vicar general of the Diocese of Natchez on 18 April 1887, and later apostolic administrator (1888‚Äì1889) after Bishop Francis Janssens was promoted to Archbishop of New Orleans in 1888. He also served as rector of St. Mary's Cathedral. Vicar Apostolic in Oklahoma On 2 June 1891, Meerschaert was appointed Vicar Apostolic of Indian Territory in Oklahoma and Titular Bishop of Sidyma by Pope Leo XIII.Brown, Thomas Elton. \\"Review of Diary of a Frontier Bishop: The Journals of Theophile Meerschaert ed. by James D. White\\". The Catholic Historical Review, vol. 83 no. 3, 1997, p. 522-522. Project MUSE He received his episcopal consecration on the following 8 September from Archbishop Janssens, with Bishops Edward Fitzgerald and Thomas Heslin serving as co-consecrators, at St. Mary's Cathedral. En route to his new assignment, he celebrated the first Pontifical High Mass in Oklahoma Territory on 20 September 1891, at Guthrie. At the time of his arrival, the vicariate had three diocesan priests, 23 Benedictine monks, 21 churches, seven day schools, five Indian boarding schools, one college, one monastery, six convents and about 5,000 Catholics. By the time of his death, the Church in Oklahoma had an elevenfold increase in Catholics, and churches and schools multiplied by some seven and five times respectively. Meerschaert also dedicated about 100 new churches and recruited around a dozen American- born clergy during his tenure. Bishop of Oklahoma Meerschaert was named the first Bishop of Oklahoma on 23 August 1905, when Pope Pius X raised the vicariate to the rank of a diocese. For thirty-two years as the Bishop, Meerschaert kept a detailed diary about his life and career in Oklahoma. It was edited and published as a book seventy years after his death. Meerschaert died on 21 February 1924 at St. Anthony's Hospital in Oklahoma City, aged 76. Originally buried at Fairlawn Cemetery in Oklahoma City, his remains were transferred to the Bishops' Vault at Resurrection Cemetery, also in Oklahoma City.

The film's plot has film noir elements in its story of a search for an old treasure by nine men including a detective tracking a fugitive, several others who have things to hide, and a love triangle involving the two leads and the fugitive. The film was shot in the Alabama Hills of California and Death Valley National Monument, locations Sturges returned to a few years later to film his classic Bad Day at Black Rock. Plot One day in contemporary Mexicali, a poker game in the back room of a cantina includes horse breeder Jim Carey, cowboys Shep and Johnny, a prospector called Old Willy, a stranger in town named Frazee and a drifter, Chalk. Guitar player Josh and bartender Bibbs are kibbitzing. Conversation turns to a legendary wagon train carrying gold bars worth $5 million lost 100 years ago in the Walking Hills, a huge area of shifting dunes across the border in the United States. Johnny, not paying attention, casually mentions how his horse recently tripped over an old wagon wheel in the hills. To keep the discovery a secret, they agree that all of them including Jim's man Cleve must join the search for the wagon train. The nine reach the apparent site but all the dunes have shifted since Johnny was there. Bibbs discovers an ox skull and Old Willy an oxen yoke and they begin digging. The group is joined by Chris Jackson, a woman who followed them from Calexico, where she works in a diner. Shep is really former rodeo rider Dave Wilson with whom Chris, herself a rodeo performer, fell in love at a rodeo in Denver, breaking off her engagement to Jim. Dave abruptly disappeared and Chris saw him again in Calexico after he showed up there as Shep, heading for the border. It turns out that Dave Wilson had fled because he accidentally killed a gambler who accused him of cheating at cards. The man's father, King, hired a detective who turns out to be Frazee, and who has been sending signals to King and a posse with a heliograph. Johnny, Chalk and Cleve are also on the run and each believes Frazee is after him. Frazee shoots Johnny during a fight. Jim, told by Johnny that he would rather die than go to prison, has Cleve hide the horses to keep Johnny from being found out if someone goes for help. A wagon is uncovered and tempers flare when no gold is found. Johnny dies right after Frazee admits he watched Chris as \\"hangman's bait,\\" waiting for Dave to show up. A terrible sand storm develops, and Chalk tries to stampede the horses, killing Frazee with his own gun. Jim kills Chalk as he tries to escape. The storm uncovers the entire wagon train. Old Willy finds it, but it's empty. Dave decides to turn himself in to the law and Chris, still in love with Dave, rides after him. Jim has a hunch, meanwhile, that the wagons weren't entirely empty when Old Willy found it. He is right.

Canada was built and owned by Charles Rufus Burgess of nearby Wolfville, Nova Scotia. Despite the decline in wooden shipbuilding, Burgess saw that there was still potential for very large wooden sailing ships to make profits in the twilight days of the wooden sailing ship era. He had built the barque Kings County, the previous year, the largest four-masted barque ever built in Canada.\\"The Great Ship Canada\\", The Dominion Illustrated, September 19, 1891, pp. 274-275 Burgess planned to make Canada to be the largest sailing ship ever built in Canada, but damage, during harvesting, to a timber intended for the keel caused her length to be trimmed by ten feet making Canada slightly smaller than the ship William D.

The Niaux cave's system is complex and has a combined length of more than of underground passages and chambers. An archaeological site with a documented history of Paleo-human presence, Niaux contains numerous distinct areas and galleries of carefully drawn and vivid wall paintings, executed in a black-outlined style typical of the classic Magdalenian period, between 17,000 and 11,000 years ago.  Overview  F√©lix Garrigou, prehistorian and hydrologist, known for his investigations of caves of southern France visited the site in 1869. He is the first person attributed to a documented suspicion - notes in his diary - about the true identity of the site. = Research = Only after a Commander Molard and his sons had discovered the gallery of Salon Noir and published a plan of the cave did Niaux attract specialists' attention in 1869. It was investigated by Henri Breuil and Emile Cartailhac a year later and received full-scale recognition. In 1925 J. Mandeman found another gallery with black paintings and called it Cartailhac Gallery. In 1971, a major scientific examination was undertaken by Jean Clottes and Robert Simonnet and in 1980 and 1981 a team of scientists made an inventory of all the pictures in the cave.  Site  Niaux Cave, situated in a steep-sided valley in the commune of Vicdessos in the Tarascon basin is one of the few cave systems left where exceptional prehistoric paintings can still be viewed by the public. The previously unrecorded separate Reseau Clastres network has been found only as recently as 1970. It holds a series of prehistoric 'footprints' and a rare charcoal sketch of a weasel. = Black Hall panel = > \\"The base of the stone is not colored and the range is restricted for the > figures: black and some red for a few of the signs.

Although the passenger areas provided for an enjoyable travel experience for the general public, she was much maligned by the crews that worked on her, and the Queen of the Islands quickly garnered a reputation as being one of the most unloved ships ever to have operated with BC Ferries. History The Queen of the Islands was built by the Burrard Drydock Co. Ltd. in North Vancouver in 1963. Queen of the Islands entered service in 1963 on the then new Route 9, which operates between Tsawwassen, Galiano Island, Mayne Island, Pender Island and Salt Spring Island. Her career got off to an inauspicious start when she suffered a mechanical failure en route to her inaugural celebrations at Ganges, Salt Spring Island, and had to be towed into port, far behind schedule. Given the nature of Route 9, with cars getting off and on at multiple ports, and always at opposite ends of the ship, loading the vehicle deck often became a nightmarish jigsaw puzzle for the crew. If vehicles were not loaded in a very precise manner, then a severe list would quickly develop. The list was severe enough that the vessel was not allowed to sail if waves were greater than five feet. The Queen of the Islands was taken off of Route 9 in 1969, as expansion of the fleet had freed up vessels that were much better suited for the demands of the route. Following her removal from Route 9, she found temporary work with the Ministry of Highways ferry system, providing additional sailings between Comox and Powell River during the summer months. This arrangement would stay in place until 1976, when the Sechelt Queen was transferred on a permanent basis from BC Ferries to the Ministry of Highways fleet. While she was on loan she had her funnel repainted in the buff colour of the Ministry of Highways. After her services were no longer required between Comox and Powell River, the Queen of the Islands once again found a summer home providing additional service between Earls Cove and Saltery Bay. During the latter part of her career with BC Ferries, the Queen of the Islands was used as a relief vessel, filling in for other ships while they were in refit. Between 1979 and 1982, she could also be found providing additional service on Route 3 between Horseshoe Bay and Langdale during the busy summer months, or when the regular vessels went in for refit. However, by the early 1980s, more and more of her time was spent laid up, and by 1987 she was no longer seeing any sort of service with BC Ferries. She was sold in October 1991 for $375,000 to St. John's Fishing Lodge Ltd., and was converted into a floating fishing camp. During this conversion process her engines were removed, thus making her reliant on tugs to be moved around. St. John's Fishing Lodge Ltd. fell into bankruptcy in November 2008, and the Queen of the Islands was subsequently put up for sale. Today Former Queen of the Islands, September 2009 In June 2009, the Queen of the Islands was sold to a private businessman from North Vancouver and renamed the \\"Spirit of the Nation\\" in honour of the Squamish Nation, in whose waters she sits. She is permanently moored in Mosquito Creek Marina near the Seabus terminal on the North Shore and has undergone extensive renovation converting it into a wedding and event venue allowing people to have a \\"supernatural\\" BC event or wedding without having to leave the conveniences of the city.

When someone finally suggests a Dr. Yeomans, she is shocked to discover the doctor is a woman. It is the turn of the century in New York and times are changing, but as yet women are not being made welcome in the field of medicine.

He was portrayed by Scott Evans from January 15, 2008, through April 12, 2010. The June 2009 announcement that the character would be romantically linked to another man in an ongoing story line came to wider attention when Patricia Mauceri (Carlotta Vega) was replaced after reportedly voicing personal religious objections to her character's involvement in the plot. In the summer of 2009, Oliver is paired with Kyle Lewis, an old friend from college. The pair had been romantically involved, but Oliver broke off the relationship for fear of upsetting his conservative family. Oliver comes out to his parents in September, and starts dating Kyle in November. The couple were written out of the show in April 2010, with ABC explaining that the storyline \\"did not have the appeal we hoped it would.\\" Impact and controversy Initially brought in as Oliver for five episodes in January 2008, Evans returned more than 30 times over the next year-and-a-half, saying in a June 2009 interview with AfterElton.com that his appearances had been \\"building up\\" since the beginning of 2009. Oliver played a supporting role in several storylines, and was briefly linked romantically to two female regular characters, Layla Williamson (Tika Sumpter) and Stacy Morasco (Crystal Hunt). On June 15, 2009, the openly gay Evans confirmed rumors that Oliver would be going through a \\"coming out story\\" and hinted at the character's possible past and future romantic entanglements with another man, Kyle Lewis (Brett Claywell). \\"I think right now it's going to be a story of his journey and how he's dealing with all this stuff ... he's doing everything in his power to kind of put this [being gay] on the backburner and not let it be a part of his life, but with Kyle in the picture, it's just coming to the forefront.\\" TV Guide later quoted Sue Johnson, vice president of daytime programming at ABC, saying: Meanwhile, on the heels of the announcement of the pending gay storyline in June 2009, Mauceri was replaced as long-running character Carlotta Vega. According to Michael Logan of TV Guide, based on her religious beliefs Mauceri had taken issue with upcoming scenes that would have Carlotta finding a book called How To Tell Your Parents That You're Gay. Though the book belongs to Oliver, Carlotta believes it is her son's, and is subsequently \\"understanding and supportive of her son's sexuality.\\" When Mauceri reportedly went to the show's executive producer Frank Valentini and \\"told him she wouldn't perform it as written and that she had reworked a significant amount of the dialogue,\\" Logan noted that \\"Valentini refused to accept Mauceri's changes and quickly replaced her with actress Saundra Santiago.\\" Characterization and portrayal thumb Asked immediately prior to the Oliver-Kyle storyline about Oliver's sexual orientation, Evans said that his character \\"comes from very conservative parents, and there's going to be a lot of people who can relate to that, and trying to hide it ... You experiment, if you do, when you're younger. Then he decides he's not gay, and he's straight and likes women, so he tries to throw himself at different girls and see where it takes him.\\" Acknowledging that Kyle's presence complicates Oliver's struggle, Evans also discussed the disparate personalities of \\"fine, upstanding cop\\" Oliver and the \\"less than ethical\\" Kyle: > I think there's definitely a conflict of interest there. Fish is very by the > book, and does everything as he's told, and follows the rules. I think him > knowing that someone he's involved with was in trouble with the law or > doesn't do everything by the book, I think that causes a whole new added > tension in addition to the history we already have. It changes it a little > bit. With some fans reportedly detecting \\"something romantic\\" between the characters early on, Evans stated that he and Claywell were initially unsure of their characters' mutual history, saying, \\"All we knew was that something had happened, but we weren't necessarily sure what it was. We had our different ideas. It's funny to see people say, 'I knew it! I knew it!.'\\" Storylines Oliver Fish first appears at the Llanview Police Department in January 2008 as Antonio Vega's new partner; Oliver (often referred to simply as \\"Fish\\") is an awkward young man with technological aptitude and a strict adherence to police regulation. Formerly employed in nearby Cherryvale, Oliver is switching places with Antonio's former partner (and lover) Talia Sahid, who had requested a transfer. Oliver returns to Cherryvale so that Antonio and Talia can reunite, but he returns to Llanview occasionally to assist his colleagues, using his computer skills to aid police detective John McBain in an investigation. The following year, Oliver is set up on a blind date with Layla Williamson. Oliver hopes to spend some time with her at the \\"Go Red\\" charity ball, but she is busy as a volunteer and has dismisses Fish as a geek; on February 17, 2009, Oliver wakes up after a night of sex with party crasher Stacy Morasco. He immediately breaks things off with Layla, thinking he has met the love of his life. Oliver is disappointed when Stacy later dismisses their evening together as a one-night stand. After cutbacks on the Cherryvale police force, Oliver moves to Llanview and is working as a security guard at Llanview Hospital in March 2009 when Rex Balsom and Natalie Buchanan break in to view security tapes. Oliver is soon put back on duty with the Llanview police while Antonio is out of town on special assignment. Suspended from the force, John is doing his own investigation into a series of murders and asks Oliver to limited access to the case files. On April 1, 2009, Oliver runs into new Llanview resident Kyle Lewis, a medical student; the two recognize each other and have an uncomfortable reunion. Oliver and Kyle are later revealed to be former members of the defunct \\"Kappa Alpha Delta\\" (KAD) fraternity of Llanview University, which coincidentally is linked to the murders. When evidence surfaces seemingly linking John to the crimes on April 17, 2009, Oliver and Talia are tasked to bring him in for questioning; Talia is stabbed to death by the killer while Oliver is on the other side of the house. Layla and Oliver begin seeing each other again. Kyle takes an unusual interest in the couple and comments to Cristian Vega that Oliver is not being honest with Layla. A protective Cristian wants to know more, but an uncomfortable Kyle vaguely maintains that though \\"something happened\\" in college, Oliver could be a different person today. Meanwhile, Oliver is hesitant about consummating his relationship with a bewildered Layla, and makes a point to advertise their relationship at the police station. Cristian reads a note Oliver leaves for Kyle asking him to stay away because Oliver is not \\"that guy\\" anymore. Confronted by Cristian, Kyle will only say that Oliver messed up a relationship in college because he cared more about what people thought, so he walked away and acted like it never happened. A sullen Kyle laments to his landlord Roxy Balsom about a guy who will not tell the truth, and she notes that he may be lying \\"to keep his world from spinning out of control.\\" Confused by Oliver's need to prove himself to his fellow police officers, Layla asks him if he is gay. The accusation angers him, and he cites his night with Stacy as proof that he is not. On August 6, 2009, Cristian puts together all that he has heard and figures out that Kyle and Oliver must have been romantically involved in college. Meanwhile, Kyle confides in a supportive Roxy that Oliver cannot admit his feelings because of his ultra-conservative family. After Roxy tells Oliver that Kyle is crazy about him, Oliver confronts Kyle. During the confrontation, Kyle reminds Oliver that they loved each other and that he still loves Oliver. Oliver claims their relationship had been a \\"phase\\" and a \\"failed experiment.\\" Kyle begs Oliver to admit that it was real, finally pulling him into a kiss. Cristian stumbles upon them; Oliver pushes Kyle away and denies that he is gay, but Cristian insists that Oliver be honest with Layla, or Cristian will. Later, Oliver seems poised to open up to Layla until he receives a phone call from his parents, who are overjoyed to hear that he has a girlfriend. Oliver and Layla sleep together, and Cristian keeps silent. Oliver apologizes to a bitter Kyle but insists that he is serious about Layla. Their intimate moment is again interrupted by Cristian, but this time Kyle backs up Oliver's story that his romantic connection to Oliver has always been one-sided. Kyle realizes that Oliver will never be with him and decides to move on. When Kyle meets and makes a date with a man named Nick Chavez, Oliver remembers his recent kiss with Kyle and warns Nick away from Kyle, citing Kyle's troubles with the law. Nick inadvertently clues Layla in to Kyle and Oliver's past relationship and she confronts Oliver, who admits that he and Kyle were sleeping together in college but maintains that he is not gay, and loves her. Layla breaks up with him. The next morning he wakes up in bed with Stacy; secretly plotting to get pregnant and pass the child off as Rex Balsom's, Stacy had overheard a confrontation between Oliver and Kyle, and taking advantage of Oliver's desperate desire to be straight, had gotten him drunk and seduced him. Sick of lying and the troubles it has caused for others, Oliver returns home and finally admits that he is gay to a supportive Cristian and Layla. In September 2009, Oliver receives a Medal of Honor from the Llanview Police Department for his assistance in bringing down a drug ring and foiling a hostage situation. His parents George and Barbara visit and come to believe that Cristian is gay when George finds a book about coming out. When George condemns Cristian, an angry Oliver defends him, and then blurts out that he is gay. George is disgusted and further troubled by Oliver's revelation that Barbara had stumbled upon him and Kyle in bed together while they were in college. George angrily storms out and, after apologizing to an emotional Oliver, Barbara follows. The next day, Oliver reveals to his mother that though he loved Kyle, he broke up with him because of Barbara's negative reaction when she walked in on them. Barbara admits that she may never understand Oliver's choices, but she still loves him. George says goodbye to Oliver but acknowledges that he cannot accept his son's \\"lifestyle\\". Oliver and Kyle finally have the break-up talk they never had. Oliver wonders what would have happened if his mother had never walked in on them, but Kyle says that Oliver probably would not have come out any sooner, to which Oliver agrees. Cristian later encourages Oliver to tell Kyle how he feels. Oliver soon tells Kyle that he loves him and wants him back, but Kyle is now dating Nick exclusively and tells Oliver that they have both changed since college and that Oliver should move on with someone else. Oliver later witnesses Kyle accept Nick's public marriage proposal at the Buenos Dias Caf√©. The wedding, scheduled for the following day, is part of a mass gay wedding to be broadcast on national television as a demonstration against the state laws that ban same-sex marriage. A devastated Oliver is on crowd control duty; overhearing homophobic remarks by a fellow police officer, Oliver emotionally reveals to everyone that he is gay and proud of it. Kyle tells Oliver that he is proud of him, and when the ceremony begins, Kyle realizes that he is still in love with Oliver. He stops the ceremony and declares his love for Oliver, who happily agrees to reconcile. Oliver and Kyle go on several dates so that they can reconnect; when they finally decide to consummate their new relationship, they are interrupted by the news that Nick has been gay-bashed. Determined to come between Kyle and Oliver, Nick schemes to keep them apart, first by manipulating events so that he can stay with Kyle and have Kyle take care of him as he recovers. Oliver gets suspicious of Nick, which incites an argument between Oliver and Kyle. Nick consoles an upset Kyle, and when Nick kisses him, Kyle realizes that Oliver is right about Nick. Nick comes clean and agrees to leave. Kyle tracks Oliver down and apologizes; Oliver forgives him and they finally make love. On March 29, 2010, Oliver finds out that he is the father of Stacy's daughter Sierra. With Stacy presumed dead, Oliver and Kyle go to court seeking custody of Sierra from Stacy's sister Gigi Morasco. At first resistant, Gigi finally volunteers to surrender Sierra to Oliver. On April 12, 2010, Kyle and Oliver walk out of the courthouse, having won custody. However, Oliver lets Gigi know that he wants her, Shane, and Rex to be a part of Sierra's life. Conclusion On March 10, 2010, TV Guide revealed that Fish and Kyle would be written off by mid-April. Executive producer Frank Valentini later released a statement stating \\"We are concluding the story that we set out to tell with Kyle and Fish. We are very proud to have broken new ground with a same-sex couple on daytime.\\" Claywell stated in an interview that Valentini had told him the news the day before when he was submitting his Emmy reel, and that Evans had found out via someone tweeting him after the TV Guide article had been released. Both of them found out after their final scenes had been filmed. Evans later expressed dissatisfaction with the way he found out, saying, \\"With the amount of time and dedication and the effort I put forward with this story line, have the decency to call me.\\" After the announcement, there was an outcry from fans. Various protests and campaigns were organized to protest the decision to cut the couple. ABC later released another statement, stating \\"The Kish story did not have the appeal we hoped it would. We are going to spend our time on stories that have a more favorable reaction from our audience.\\" Upon Oliver's departure from the show on Monday April 12 and Kyle's exit on Friday April 16, One Life to Live hit new lows in total viewers.

He was also count of the Tierra de Campos, which was later formed into the County of Monz√≥n for his son. A certain Fernando is first mentioned in a charter to the monastery of San Pedro de Carde√±a dated 13 November 917 as \\"count of Castile\\", possibly Fernando Ans√∫rez. According to Sampiro, Fernando (\\"Fredenandi Ansuri filius\\") was one of the counts of the region of Burgos, the chief city of Castile‚Äîthe others being Nu√±o Fern√°ndez, Abolmondar Albo, and Diego Rodr√≠guez‚Äîwho were captured by Ordo√±o II on the river Carri√≥n in the place called Tebulare or Tegulare (\\"Tejar\\" or \\"Tejares\\" in Spanish, as yet unidentified) and imprisoned them in Le√≥n. This event is known as the Episodio de Tebular (Episode of Tebular) and it took place probably no earlier than the autumn of 921. The later chronicler Pelagius of Oviedo interpolated into Sampiro's account the words et erant ei rebelles (\\"and they were rebels\\") in order to explain Ordo√±o's action, but this is conjecture, as is the modern suggestion that it is related to the defeat at the Battle of Valdejunquera.Mart√≠nez 2005, 256. Two charters from Carde√±a preserve the latest record of Fernando and the only (certain) record of him under the title Count of Castile; they date to 1 OctoberIt reads: regnante principe Adefonso in Legione et comite Fredinando Assuriz in Castella (Mart√≠nez 2005, 197). and 24 November 929.It reads: regnante rex Adefonso in Legione et comite Fredinando Assuriz in Castella (Mart√≠nez 2005, 197). In the spring of 932 the head of the Banu Ans√∫rez allied with the Banu G√≥mez in rebellion against Ramiro II and in favour of his abdicated brother Alfonso IV, who had come out of retirement to challenge for the throne. The title count is given to the leader of this rebellion by Ibn Hayyan a century later, and it may have been either Fernando or his son Ansur. Alfonso IV and his allies were defeated in the ensuing civil war, and Ramiro bestowed Castile on his partisan, Fern√°n Gonz√°lez. As Fernando Ans√∫rez does not appear in the record thereafter, he was perhaps killed in combat.Mart√≠nez D√≠ez 1986, 344‚Äì46. Fernando married a certain Muniadomna sometime after January 914. She is last mentioned in a document of 919 and was certainly deceased by 929. She was perhaps the widow of Garc√≠a I of Le√≥n and thus a daughter of the Castilian count Nu√±o Mu√±oz. She gave Fernando one known child, a son, Ansur. The earliest reference to Ansur is found in a document dated 4 March 921, wherein he is named with his parents in a donation to Carde√±a in the vicinity of Burgos.

He lived in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, and was an entertainment columnist at the Toronto Star newspaper from the mid-1980s until his death in May 2013. In Australia he came to popular fame as a singer-songwriter for the country rock band Country Radio (1970‚Äì73). Their biggest hit, \\"Gypsy Queen\\", co-written by Quill with bandmate Kerryn Tolhurst, was released in August 1972 and peaked at No. 12 on the Go-Set National Top 40. After getting an arts grant, Quill travelled to Toronto in 1974 and by the mid-1980s had become a journalist with the Toronto Star. By 1983 he was married to Ellen Davidson, a public relations executive. Greg Quill died on 5 May 2013, at the age of 66, from \\"complications due to pneumonia\\". Biography=Early life= Gregory Raymond Quill was born on 18 April 1947 to Raymond and Doris Quill (n√©e Markham). He grew up in Sydney with a younger brother, Christopher. From the age of about 15 years he learned how to play acoustic guitar and his first public performance was in his final year of high school. Quill began his musical career in the 1960s as a solo performer on the Sydney folk scene clustered around the University of Sydney, where he graduated in 1970 with a Bachelor of Arts in English Language and Literature. He worked briefly as a history teacher at a Catholic boys high school in Bankstown. He was hired by David Elfick, then the local editor of the national weekly pop music magazine, Go-Set (later Elfick was a movie producer). Quill worked as a writer from 1969, then feature writer (February 1970 to August 1971) and Sydney regional editor (July 1970 to August 1971) for the Melbourne-based publication. Note: This PDF is 282 pages. In 2002 Quill recalled that editing Go-Set had prepared him for his later work in journalism. =Early musical career= From 1967 Greg Quill ran The Shack, a folk music venue at Narrabeen on Sydney's northern beaches, he also performed there. In 1999 he described the venue \\"[it] was a sort of folk co-operative, and everybody who performed on a particular evening got to share in the door takings ‚Äì it was never more than a couple of bucks\\". In 1969 Quill handed over the running of the venue to his younger brother, Christopher. Gus McNeil, a music publisher, record producer and former singer and saxophonist for 1960s rock band, Gus & The Nomads, signed Quill to a publishing deal with his company, Cellar Music. McNeil produced Quill's first commercial recording, the single, \\"Fleetwood Plain\\", and the subsequent album of the same name. Quill wrote all the tracks on the album. Note: User may have to click on 'Search again' and then 'Enter a title' to check further tracks. For the album Quill was backed by Orlando Agostino on guitars, Chris Blanchflower on harmonica, John Walsh on bass guitar, and members of local rock band Pirana: Jim Duke- Yonge on drums, Tony Hamilton on guitar, Graeme Thompson on bass guitar and Stan White on keyboards. Early in 1970 the album was released on EMI's new subsidiary label, Harvest Records, although the title single had been issued on EMI's Australian pop label Columbia Records. \\"Fleetwood Plain\\" was subsequently covered by Australian country musician, Reg Lindsay, and by Canadian folk-rockers Creamcheeze Good Time Band on their 1973 album, Home Cookin'. =Country Radio band= To promote Fleetwood Plain Greg Quill formed the original line-up of Country Radio (also seen as Greg Quill's Country Radio or Greg Quill and Country Radio) in June 1970. Other members were Agostino, Blanchflower, Walsh and Dave Hannagan on percussion and backing vocals. The group started as an acoustic act but from 1970 to 1971 its musical style evolved into electric country rock, a style then gaining popularity through the influence of albums like The Band's Music from Big Pink (1968), The Byrds' Sweetheart of the Rodeo (1968), and Bob Dylan's Nashville Skyline (1969). By May 1971 Country Radio's line-up had changed with Blanchflower and Quill joined by Mal Algar on bass guitar (ex-Chorus), John A. Bird on keyboards and Ace Follington on drums (ex-Chain). In October that year the group signed to Infinity Records, a new subsidiary of Festival Records and recorded their debut single, \\"Listen to the Children\\", which came out in November although it did not chart. Soon after, Follington left to join a pop band, The Cleves, for a tour of Britain; he was replaced on drums by Kim Bryant, who was in turn was replaced a few months later by Tony Bolton (ex-The Affair, Freshwater). In January 1972 Algar left and they were joined by John Du Bois (ex-Circle of Love, New Dream) on bass guitar and Kerryn Tolhurst on guitar, lap steel and mandolin (ex-Adderley Smith Blues Band, Sundown). The addition of Tolhurst was crucial to the band's sound and style, Quill and Tolhurst began a songwriting partnership. With the \\"classic\\" line-up of Quill, Tolhurst, Bird, Bois, Bolton and Blanchflower, Country Radio recorded their second and most successful single, \\"Gypsy Queen\\", with producer John French, in Melbourne in April 1972. It was co-written by Quill and Tolhurst, and featured a string arrangement by session musician, Peter Jones (who later worked on Quill's solo album, The Outlaw's Reply). Released in August, the single spent 13 weeks in the Go-Set National Top 40 and peaked at No. 12. Note: Used for Australian Singles and Albums charting from 1974 until Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) created their own charts in mid-1988. In 1992, Kent back calculated chart positions for 1970‚Äì1974. \\"Gypsy Queen\\" shared the APRA (Australasian Performing Right Association) Song of the Year award with Mississippi's \\"Kings of the World\\". It was featured on the soundtrack of director Rod Hardy's 2007 film, December Boys, starring Daniel Radcliffe, and in the 2009 ABC-TV series, East of Everything. The chart success of the single and the interest of expatriate Canadian music promoter and label representative, Michael McMartin, led to a contract with Toronto-based MUCH Productions, which issued \\"Gypsy Queen\\" in Canada in 1972. At the end of that year they toured Canada to promote its release. The group's follow-up single, \\"Wintersong\\", appeared in December 1972 and made the Go-Set Top 40 in April, the next year. On 4 October 1972 the group had recorded a live-in-the-studio performance before an invited audience, which Infinity released as their debut album, Country Radio Live, in December. It included a selection of originals, plus two tracks, \\"Some Lonesome Picker\\" and \\"Never Goin' Back\\", written by John Stewart (ex-The Kingston Trio). The band made several live TV recordings for the ABC-TV in- studio concert and interview series, GTK; including \\"Just Goodbye\\" (May 1971), \\"Last Time Around\\" (June), \\"Empty Pockets\\" (June), \\"Almost Freedom\\" (June), \\"Silver Spurs\\" (February 1972), \\"Commisar\\" (March), \\"Some Lonesome Picker\\" (April, May), \\"Listen to the Children\\" (October), \\"Fleetwood Plain\\" (November), \\"Gypsy Queen\\" (November), \\"Winter Song\\" (November), \\"I Need a Woman\\" and an interview on their break-up (April 1973). They appeared on concert and festival stages with different artists of the era, including Creedence Clearwater Revival, Elton John, Santana and Stephen Stills. They performed at the Rock Isle Mulwala Festival in 1972 and the Sunbury Pop Festivals in January 1972 and again the following year. Their live performance of \\"Silver Spurs\\" ‚Äì written by Quill ‚Äì at the latter festival, was included in Mushroom Records' triple live album, Sunbury 1973 ‚Äì The Great Australian Rock Festival, released in April. Tolhurst abruptly left the band after the second Sunbury festival, briefly joining Mississippi, before forming The Dingoes in Melbourne, with singer-harmonicist, Broderick Smith. Soon after, both Bird and Blanchflower also left Country Radio. Quill, Bolton and Du Bois were joined by Adelaide guitarist-songwriter Russ Johnson (ex-Mississippi) ‚Äì effectively swapping places with Tolhurst. In May 1973 that line-up recorded the group's fourth single, a country-rock restatement of the traditional song, \\"Bound for South Australia\\", which did not chart. The four-piece ensemble opened for British folk-rock band Fairport Convention on three dates of their 1973 tour, which despite promotions did not include former lead singer, Sandy Denny. Soon after, Johnson left Country Radio for medical reasons and returned to Adelaide. Guitarists Les Stacpool and Russ Hinton (ex-Moonstone) alternated on lead guitar after Johnson's departure. Hinton also performed on Quill's subsequent solo LP. Du Bois left in August 1973, rejoining Tolhurst in The Dingoes. Country Radio had toured relentlessly during 1972 to 1973 and according to Australian musicologist, Ed Nimmervoll, they were \\"driven into the ground to the point where disintegration was inevitable\\". Quill dissolved the group in December 1973 and decided to return to his solo music career. He also worked for a year as general features writer and news reporter for The Sunday Telegraph, then as editor of the suburban weekly newspaper, The Peninsula News. In 1974, Quill, performing solo, opened for Fairport Convention in several Australian cities. In the same year Quill recorded a solo studio album, The Outlaw's Reply, with the financial backing of Sydney- based executive producer and Trafalgar Studios owner Charles Fisher. It was produced by John L Sayers and featured Country Radio alumni: Blanchflower, Bolton, Du Bois, Hinton and Tolhurst, plus former collaborator Jones on keyboards. Also appearing on the album were Barry Leef on backing vocals, Chris Neal on synthesisers and Peter Walker on guitar. Two singles from the album were issued during 1975: \\"She Do It to Me\\" (April) and \\"Blackmail\\" / \\"The Outlaw's Reply\\" (September). The album included the Quill song \\"Almost Freedom\\", which had previously been covered by former Company Caine singer Gulliver Smith on his 1973 solo LP The Band's Alright But The Singer Is .... During 1974 Festival also released a compilation album, Gypsy Queen, credited to Greg Quill & Country Radio, contained selection of album tracks, and A- and B-sides of singles. It included Quill's cover of the country classic \\"Singin' the Blues\\", which featured Renee Geyer on backing vocals and Stacpool on guitar. In May 1975 Quill promoted the release of The Outlaw's Reply by a performance at the Sydney Opera House, backed by the musicians who had contributed to the album. The Dingoes and Richard Clapton were also part of the first all-Australian country-rock show to take place on the Opera House's main stage. It was Quill's final performance in Australia for almost four years. Quill was one of the first Australian rock musicians to be awarded a grant by the Australian Council for the Arts, alongside Margret RoadKnight and guitarist Rob MacKenzie (MacKenzie Theory). The grant enabled him to travel overseas and he moved between Toronto and Sydney for most of 1975. In Toronto he put together a new band, Hot Knives, with Bolton, and Toronto-based bass guitarist Dennis Pinhorn and violinist Anne Lindsay, and expatriate Australian guitarist, keyboardist, and songwriter Sam See (ex-Sherbet, The Flying Circus, Fraternity, Lighthouse). In 1977 Australian guitarist and songwriter Chris Stockley (Cam-Pact, Axiom, The Dingoes) replaced Lindsay in 1977 and bass guitarist Bruce Worrall (also ex-Sherbet) replaced Pinhorn, the band of Toronto-based expatriates took up the name Southern Cross. In October 1978 Southern Cross released only one single, \\"Been So Long\\" on Warner's Elektra Records label. The group split at the end of that year, during a tour of Australia. Quill returned to Canada alone. A re-arranged and remixed version of \\"Been So Long\\", with parts added in Toronto by bass guitarist Steve Hogg, singer Ian Thomas and keyboardist Hugh Syme, was released in Canada as Quill's first solo single there, but it was the B-side, the raucous, guitar-heavy \\"I Wonder Why\\", that got most of the attention on Canadian radio, particularly Toronto's then hard-rock FM station Q107 (CILQ). A proposed album, \\"Correspondence\\", produced in Toronto by Alan Thorne, and featuring mostly new Quill compositions and guest performances by Canadian guitarists Amos Garrett and Mike McKenna (Mendelson McKenna Mainline), as well as Thomas, Hogg and Syme, was never released. =Journalist in Canada= After the demise of Southern Cross in 1978 Greg Quill stopped playing music professionally for almost two decades. He resided in Toronto and then Hamilton. By 1983 he had married Ellen Davidson, a concert promoter-turned-corporate public relations executive. They had a daughter, and together they also raised her two children. Quill wrote for and edited numerous music magazines ‚Äì Music Express (1981‚Äì82), Graffiti (1982‚Äì83), Applaud, The Canadian Composer, Songwriter. From 1983 he was a journalist and occasional TV and radio commentator on the arts scene in Toronto, where he was an entertainment columnist for the Toronto Star, Canada's largest newspaper. Quill believed his earlier career helped with journalism, as \\"musicians sense that I know what I'm talking about, so there's an element of trust, and when there's trust they're more forthcoming than they would be with a journalist who was just off the city desk. But also I was able to frame stories in a way that led readers into an insight that illuminated the musician's life for readers, which I still think is an edge\\". He also published books about musicians: Bon Jovi ‚Äì Bon Jovi: Hard Rock for the '80s (1987), Michael Jackson ‚Äì Michael Jackson Electrifying (1988) and The Rolling Stones ‚Äì The Rolling Stones 25th Anniversary Tour (1989). The latter had live reviews by Lenny Stoute. =Musical career resumed= In September 1999 an impromptu reunion in Melbourne with former bandmates Tolhurst and Stockley led to Quill's returning to performing music. Over the next two years, with Quill in Toronto and Tolhurst in New York, the pair maintained contact and resumed songwriting. They formed a duo, Quill-Tolhurst and in early 2003 issued an album, So Rudely Interrupted, in Canada on the True North Records label. They promoted its release with a concert in October that year at C'est What? in Toronto, performing with a full band including Garth Hudson (ex The Band) on keyboards, accordion and piano. Excerpts from the show were aired nationally on Bravo! Canada's Arts & Minds and on CP24. The duo made a short Australian tour, for their first public performances there since 1973, appearing at several festivals, including the Port Fairy Folk Festival and the Brunswick Music Festival in Melbourne. Their concerts in Sydney reunited Quill with friends from his folk days at The Shack. At the final gig of the tour, at the Bridge Hotel, Sydney, Quill and Tolhurst were joined on stage by Country Radio bandmate Blanchflower. From 2003 Quill became a regular performer in Canada's roots music scene, as both a solo act and with members of a loose collective that included Bucky Berger on drums, Anne Lindsay on violin, Denis Keldie on accordion, Cam MacInnes on guitar, and Dennis Pinhorn on bass guitar. From June 2006 to March 2008 Quill compiled and hosted the hour-long weekly Canadian roots music speciality program, River of Song, on Sirius Canada satellite radio. He returned to Australia in July 2009, and played two shows in his home town, one at the revived Shack in Narrabeen, and another at the Excelsior Hotel in Sydney, where he was joined for several songs by former bandmates Agostino and Blanchflower. In January and February 2011 Quill toured Australia's east coast, playing 15 dates with Toronto singer-songwriter, Jon Brooks. Quill started recording an album of new material during 2012. Quill also performed with fellow expatriate Australian Terry Wilkins on bass guitar, (ex-The Flying Circus) in the band, Ironbark, which also featured Berger and MacInnes, with Mitchell Lewis on drums, guitar, and stringed instruments. On his website, Quill described Ironbark as \\"an extension of the traditional bush music and country-rock roots of core members Quill and Wilkins, whose musical kinship extends even further back than their time with fabled Australian country-rock bands Country Radio and Flying Circus, respectively, to Sydney's folk, blues and jug band haunts in the late 1960s\\".Greg Quill Official Website ‚Äì News =Death and legacy= Greg Quill died on 5 May 2013 at his home in Hamilton. His family announced that he had \\"passed away suddenly but peacefully this afternoon from complications due to pneumonia and a recently diagnosed case of sleep apnea\\". Aged 66, he was still an entertainment journalist for the Toronto Star at the time of his death. He was survived by his wife, Ellen Davidson, their daughter Kaya, a grandson, and his two stepdaughters. In the April prior to his death, Quill had announced via Facebook that he was working with Warner Music Australia and Gil Matthews' Aztec Music label on the reissue of his 1970s and 1980s recordings, and he was planning to tour Australia later in 2013 to promote them. Aztec are scheduled to release new CD versions of Quill's solo albums, Fleetwood Plain and The Outlaw's Reply, and the Country Radio Live album, with bonus tracks from a recently rediscovered recording of a 1970s festival performance by Country Radio, which includes otherwise unrecorded tracks. Warner Music (who now own the Infinity/Festival Records archive) are set to release a new edition of Gypsy Queen as a CD compilation, expanded with previously unreleased tracks. In addition, Quill had announced plans to reissue his \\"lost\\" solo album, Correspondence, which had been recorded in Toronto in 1980 with producer Alan Thorne and featured contributions from Amos Garrett, Mike McKenna, and Ian Thomas. Quill had said that the album was being restored from a safety master that had recently come to light, and that it would also include bonus material, recorded around the same time in Canada for radio broadcasts, with his bands, Hot Knives and Southern Cross. Correspondence was due to be released on the Canadian label So Rude Records, but would have a separate Australian distributor. Quill had been set to release a new solo album of acoustic material that he had been working on over the previous few years.

A leading Roman Catholic Church thinker of his time, he was associated with the far right tendency within Argentine Catholic thinking. As a polemicist he had a strong influence on the development of nacionalismo. Background Meinvielle studied for his Doctorate in Philosophy and Theology in Rome and soon afterwards became a prolific writer of religious, historical and economic books within the school of Thomism.Graciela Ben-Dror, The Catholic Church and the Jews, 2009, p. 49 He came to see history as a process of decline in Catholic values, as determined by three events that he saw as catastrophic i.e. the work of Martin Luther, the French Revolution and the October Revolution.Graciela Ben-Dror, The Catholic Church and the Jews, 2009, pp. 49-50 Catholic orthodoxy Meinvielle was a staunch critic of what he perceived as slipping standards in Catholic teaching. On this basis he had a well publicized feud with Jacques Maritain during the late 1930s. The conflict had begun in 1936 when Maritain visited Argentina for the first time and was initially well received by a number of leading Catholic figures.Carlos Alberto Torres, The Church, society, and hegemony, p. 183 Meinvielle attacked Maritain as the 'advocate of the Spanish Reds', sparking off a war of words between the two.David Lehmann, Democracy And Development, 1992, p. 105 His book From Lammenais to Maritain was actually an attack on the ideas of Jacques Maritain, claiming that Maritain was defending the faithlessness of modern society by his endorsement of liberalism.William T. Cavanaugh, Torture and Eucharist, 1998, p. 155 Tracing the origins of Maritain's work to Hugues Felicit√© Robert de Lamennais as well as that of Marc Sangnier and Le Sillon, he argued that the humanism of these writers was incompatible with the Catholic faith.Darrell Jodock, Catholicism contending with modernity, 2000, p. 331 He took as the basis for his Catholicism the works of Thomas Aquinas and the Papal encyclicals Rerum novarum and Quadragesimo anno, contrasting them with his twin political hates of liberalism and communism. Antisemitism He was also critic of capitalism and Marxism and he sought to draw parallels between the two by arguing that materialism was the basis for both. Instead he sought an economic system based on Roman Catholicism in which consumption regulated production and in which wealth creation was fine as long as the wealth was re-invested.Sandra McGee Deutsch, Las Derechas, 1999, p. 225 In common with Rodolfo Irazusta he was a stern critic of usury and he blamed this practice on the Jews, citing Werner Sombart as his inspiration for this conclusion. Meinvielle added a strong belief in Sinarquia, a supposed secret society designed to conspire to bring about Jewish domination of the world.F. Finchelstein, The Ideological Origins of the Dirty War: Fascism, Populism, and Dictatorship in Twentieth Century Argentina, Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 111 He further contended that Judaism had the destruction of Christianity as its basis and therefore argued that whatever ills befell the Christian world were inherently the fault of the Jews. As part of this critique he repeated the blood libel as well as suggesting that capitalism and communism were both Jewish constructs as part of their plan for world domination.Sandra McGee Deutsch, Las Derechas, 1999, p. 226 Whilst his ideas owed a lot to the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, Meinvielle did not explicitly endorse that document, as a number of contemporary court cases had found it to be a fraud. He added a Christological dimension to his anti-Semitism by arguing that the grand struggle between Christianity and Judaism was a parallel to that between Jesus Christ and Satan. He did however feel that it was possible to defeat the Jews by unity and, where necessary, violence, drawing on the notions of Nimio de Anqu√≠n that violence in service of 'truth' is justified. To this end he applauded the rise of fascism, for which he saw a Christian mission. He was particularly enamoured of the falangism variant as he was a believer in the virtues of Hispanidad and Spain playing a leading role in the fortunes of Latin America. Meinvielle did however feel that the cult of personality surrounding both Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler was contrary to Catholicism and the primacy of Christ and so argued that any Argentine version of fascism would have to be avowedly religious and anti-secular.Finchelstein, The Ideological Origins of the Dirty War, pp. 38-40 His 1936 book El Judio distilled these fascist views and gave his thinking an Argentine dimension as he argued Buenos Aires was the archetype of 'Babylon', dominated as he felt it was by international Jewish financial interests.Graciela Ben-Dror, The Catholic Church and the Jews, 2009, p. 51 Politically he was associated with a coterie of young Catholic intellectuals, including M√°ximo Etchecopar, Ignacio Anzoategui and Mat√≠as S√°nchez Sorondo, who produced the 1937 document Programma Nacionalista. He subsequently joined the Nueva Politica group when S√°nchez Sorondo established it in 1941.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, Simon & Schuster, 1990, p. 261 Later years Meinville taught philosophy at Catholic institutions for much of his life and he would also serve as the chaplain at Santa Casa de Ejercicios. He continued to write widely and from the late 1940s to the 1960s he published three journals, Balcon, Dialogo and Presencia, in which he expressed his religious and political views. Meinville initially supported Edelmiro Juli√°n Farrell and his successor Juan Per√≥n, but began to have doubts about Peronism, feeling that socio-economic concerns had become too prominent at the expense of the initial hard-line nationalism that attracted him. He was particularly critical of Per√≥n's attempts to woo the trade union movement to his side and subsequently denounced Peron as a demagogue.Finchelstein, The Ideological Origins of the Dirty War, p. 94 In 1952 Meinvielle became a leading figure in the Union F√©d√©rale, a post-Per√≥n party of the right. Continuing to be outspoken in his condemnation of those who did not meet his standards, Meinville was finally suspended from the Catholic Church in 1961 by Antonio Caggiano, the Archbishop of Buenos Aires, after he stated that President Arturo Frondizi was a communist agent.Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right, p. 262 He was also a strong critic of the regime of Juan Carlos Ongan√≠a, claiming that he was acting on behalf of Sinarquia.Finchelstein, The Ideological Origins of the Dirty War, pp. 110-111 Influence Meinvielle's influence was strong throughout the far right in Argentina. Practically, he served as advisor and spiritual inspiration to the highly anti-Semitic Tacuara Nationalist Movement.Sandra McGee Deutsch, Las Derechas, 1999, p. 325 However, on a wider level he had a deep impact on the nationalist intellectual strand, with the likes of Jos√© L√≥pez Rega (who shared his belief in the fictitious Sinarquia)Finchelstein, The Ideological Origins of the Dirty War, p. 114 and Jord√°n Bruno Genta heavily influenced by his words.Graciela Ben-Dror, The Catholic Church and the Jews, 2009, p. 57 Other future government figures such as Mario Amadeo, Alberto Baldrich and Samuel Medrano were also influenced by his works to an extent.Graciela Ben-Dror, The Catholic Church and the Jews, 2009, p. 94 Similarly Colonel Mohamed Al√≠ Seineld√≠n, who was arrested in 1987 for plotting a military coup also declared himself a disciple of Meinvielle.Graciela Ben-Dror, The Catholic Church and the Jews, 2009, p. 58 The diplomat M√°ximo Etchecopar had also written for Meinvielle's journal Balc√≥n during his formative years.Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right, p. 118 He was also influential on the Argentine scouting movement as he was founder of the Union Scouts Cat√≥licos Argentinos.

It was the climax of a four-year period, starting in 213, when Caracalla pursued a lengthy campaign in central and eastern Europe and the Near East. After intervening to overthrow rulers in client kingdoms adjoining Parthia, he invaded in 216 using an abortive wedding proposal to the Parthian king's daughter as a casus belli. His forces carried out a campaign of massacres in the northern regions of the Parthian Empire before withdrawing to Asia Minor, where he was assassinated in April 217. The war was ended the following year after a heavy battle at Nisibis, with the Romans paying a huge sum of war reparations to the Parthians. Events leading up to the war In the years immediately before the war, Parthia was roiled by a conflict between the two sons of King Vologases V. Vologases VI succeeded his father in 208 but his brother Artabanus V rebelled and declared himself king soon afterwards. While Artabanus eventually gained the upper hand, though without totally defeating his brother, the conflict destabilised the neighbouring kingdoms of Armenia and Osroene in the buffer zone between the Roman and Parthian Empires. Caracalla exploited civil strife in both kingdoms in order to expand Roman power in the region and set the scene for an advance into Parthia.Scott, p. 27 As Armenia and Osroene were both in the Parthian sphere of influence at this time ‚Äì Armenia had swung between being either a Roman or a Parthian client state for over a century ‚Äì he evidently saw an establishment of Roman domination as being a way of reducing Parthian power and positioning himself for an eventual move against Parthia itself.Scott, p. 28 According to the Roman historian Cassius Dio, the Osroenean king Abgar X aroused discontent among his people by ruling them harshly. Caracalla used this as a pretext to overthrow Abgar, summoning him to a meeting and then imprisoning the king. With Abgar out of the way, Caracalla proceeded to annex Osroene and make it a Roman province. Three years later, he intervened in a civil conflict between Khosrov I of Armenia and his sons. The emperor offered to mediate in their dispute but proceeded to imprison the king and his quarrelling sons, provoking an uprising among the Armenians. The uprising was still ongoing at the time of Caracalla's death in 217. Caracalla travelled to the eastern Mediterranean in 215 and remained in the region for the rest of his reign, making Antioch his de facto capital during this period. He is reported by Herodian to have sought to associate himself with Alexander the Great ‚Äì to have \\"become Alexander\\" ‚Äì when he marched into Asia Minor via Macedonia, and to have ordered the construction of numerous statues of the conqueror in Rome and elsewhere as a consequence. Dio and Herodian both report that Caracalla travelled to Alexandria in Egypt to pay his respects at the tomb of the Macedonian king but instead carried out a great massacre of the local population in 215.Scott, p. 29 Parthian campaign and assassination During the winter of 215/16, he stayed in Nicomedia with the Roman army preparing to launch a campaign against the Armenians and Parthians. According to Dio, Caracalla sought a pretext for war in the refusal by the Parthian king Vologases VI to release a pair of hostages ‚Äì Tiridates of Armenia and a Cynic philosopher named Antiochus. However, when Vologases was deposed by his brother Artabanus the hostages were sent to Caracalla, temporarily depriving the emperor of a casus belli. Caracalla instead invented a new basis for war, though Dio and Herodian present conflicting accounts of what happened. Both historians record that Caracalla justified his war on the grounds that Artabanus had denied the emperor's request to marry the Parthian king's daughter. Dio states that Artabanus refused because he believed, probably correctly, that Caracalla would use the marriage as an excuse to annex Parthia. Herodian presents a different version, stating that Artabanus was worn down by Caracalla's requests and agreed to the marriage. During a celebration of Caracalla's arrival, probably at the Parthian royal palace in Arbela, Caracalla ordered his troops to massacre the bride and guests. Herodian writes: The Roman army then carried out a campaign of massacres in Parthia, though its area of operations seems to have been limited to northern Mesopotamia and the pro-Parthian kingdom of Adiabene; as such, this may have been intended more as a demonstration of Roman power than a serious attempt to conquer Parthia. Cassius Dio describes how Caracalla now ravaged a large section of the country around Media by making a sudden incursion, sacked many fortresses, won over Arbela, dug open the royal tombs of the Parthians, and scattered the bones about. This was the easier for him to accomplish inasmuch as the Parthians did not even join battle with him ... The barbarians took refuge in the mountains beyond the Tigris in order to complete their preparations, but Antoninus [Caracalla] suppressed this fact and took to himself as much credit as if he had utterly vanquished these foes, whom as a matter of fact he had not even seen.Dio, Roman History, 79:1 Caracalla subsequently informed the Roman Senate by letter that Parthia had been defeated and was awarded the title of Parthicus Maximus, \\"great conqueror of Parthia\\", to go along with his existing titles Britannicus Maximus and Germanicus Maximus (referring to earlier campaigns in Britain and Germany).Scott, p. 30 The army spent the winter at Edessa, but Caracalla was assassinated on 8 April 217 while urinating at a roadside. The Parthians regrouped, fighting the Romans to a bloody standstill at the Battle of Nisibis.Scott, p. 265 His successor, Macrinus, brought the war to an end in 218 by paying the Parthians reparations of possibly as much as 50 million denarii.Ando, p. 64 References Wars involving the Roman Empire Roman‚ÄìParthian Wars 210s conflicts 216 217 210s in the Roman Empire 3rd century in Iran Caracalla Massacres committed by former countries Massacres in Asia Wars involving the Parthian Empire Wars of succession involving the states and peoples of Asia Wars of succession involving the states and peoples of Europe ","title":"Parthian war of Caracalla"},{"id":"23737282","text":"Matt Berquist (born 11 May 1983 in Waipukurau, New Zealand) is a rugby union player who plays at fly-half for Benetton Rugby Treviso in the Rabodirect Pro12. Playing career=Provincial Rugby= Berquist attended the University of Otago and represented Otago in 2003 and 2004. In 2005, he transferred to Hawke's Bay where he would blossom as a player, helping the Magpies turnaround from perennial struggles to Air New Zealand Cup semi- finalists in 2008 and 2009. During this time, Berquist earned a reputation as one of the best goal-kickers in the competition, finishing as the Cup's leading scorer in 2009. For the 2010 ITM Cup, Berquist transferred to Auckland. He again topped 100 points in the competition, including finally scoring his first provincial try in his 8th season in the competition. =Super Rugby= Berquist was initially a member of the Highlanders in 2004 while still playing for Otago, but he failed to see action in a single game. Berquist's strong performances for Hawke's Bay earned him a Super 14 contract with the Highlanders for the 2009 season. After starting the season as a bench player, he started 6 of the final 7 matches of the season at his preferred position of fly-half. He shared goal-kicking duties with Daniel Bowden and finished the season with 49 points, including his first try in Super Rugby. For 2010, Berquist faced increased competition for the starting fly-half position with the Highlanders from Michael Hobbs and Robbie Robinson, although he still managed to match his 2009 total with 6 starts. His goal-kicking opportunities decreased from 2009 due to the emergence of Israel Dagg as one of the top goal-kickers in Super 14. In 2011, Berquist was back up for Dan Carter at the Crusaders. =European Rugby= Berquist signed for Leinster Rugby for the 2011/12 Pro12 season. He was to play back up to Jonathan Sexton.

She's a three-time International Racquetball Federation World Champion in Women's Singles, tied with Michelle Gould and Cheryl Gudinas for the most ever World Singles titles by a female. She is also a three-time World Champion in Women's Doubles, and is the only woman to have won both singles and doubles at Worlds. Longoria is also the #1 player on the Ladies Professional Racquetball Tour (LPRT) tour, and was the first Mexican woman to attain the #1 pro ranking, doing so at the end of the 2008-09 season. She repeated the feat at the end of 2009‚Äì2010 season, and has been #1 for the last eight seasons. Longoria's style is characterized by a semi-western grip of the racquet, which is unusual for racquetball; Longoria is the only pro player using this grip style. Professional career Longoria was undefeated on the LPRT for three and a half years, from May 2011 to October 2014. As of the end of the 2017-18 season, she's won 82 Tier 1 or Grand Slam events on the LPRT, including eight US Opens. Most recently in 2017, she defeated Fr√©d√©rique Lambert, 11-7, 11-4, 2-11, 11-3, to win her 8th US Open. In the 2014 US Open, Longoria beat Maria Jose Vargas in the first US Open final to feature two non-US players.

Longoria's beaten Rhonda Rajsich in four US Open finals: 2015, 2013, 2012 and 2011. Her first US Open win was in 2008 when she beat Cheryl Gudinas in the final, becoming the first Mexican to win that event or even reach the US Open final. Her first women's pro tournament win was the Outback Steakhouse Blast It! tournament in Fayetteville, N.C., September 13-16, 2007, when she defeated Rajsich in the final, 12-14, 11-8, 9-11, 11-6, 11-7. Longoria has finished as the #1 pro player at the end of nine pro seasons: 2008-09, 2009‚Äì10, 2011‚Äì12, 2012‚Äì13, 2013‚Äì14, 2014‚Äì15, 2015‚Äì16, 2016‚Äì17 and 2017-18.http://www.wprotour.com/player_bios/athletes_paola.html International career Longoria is the most successful International Racquetball player in history, with 30 International titles. As of 2018, she has 17 career IRF singles titles and another 13 career IRF doubles titles. Longoria won Women's Singles at the 2016 World Championships in Cali, Colombia, where she defeated Gabriela Martinez of Guatemala in the final, 15-12, 15-7. She defeated Maria Jose Vargas in the semi-finals, 15-5, 15-5. In Cali, Longoria and teammate Samantha Salas lost the Women's Doubles final to Americans Aimee Ruiz and Janel Tisinger, 15-11, 9-15, 11-8. In the semis, they defeated Bolivians Jenny Daza and Adriana Riveros, 15-5, 15-5. The gold in singles was Longoria's 6th gold at Worlds, putting her one behind Jackie Paraiso, but Paraiso's 7 gold are all in doubles, while Longoria has won three in singles and three in doubles. Earlier in 2016, Longoria won gold in both Women's Singles and Women's Doubles, with Salas, at the Pan American Championships in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. She defeated Canadian Fr√©d√©rique Lambert in the singles final, 15-3, 15-6, and Americans Kelani Bailey and Michelle Key, 15-5, 15-10. In 2014, Longoria won both Women's Singles and Doubles at the World Championships in Burlington, Ontario, Canada, where she defeated American Rhonda Rajsich in the singles final and with Samantha Salas beat Americans Aimee Ruiz and Janel Tisinger. This was a successful defense of the titles she first won in 2012 in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, where Longoria defeated Canadian Jennifer Saunders in the singles final to become the first Mexican woman to be World Champion. Her 2014 doubles win was the third World Championship for her and Samantha Salas, as they also won in 2012 and 2010, which was the first time a Mexican team had won Women's Doubles at Worlds. In the 2012 final, they defeated the Chilean team of Angela Grisar and Carla Mu√±oz, while in 2010, they beat the American pair of Aimee Ruiz and Jackie Paraiso in the final. Longoria has twice won three gold medals for Mexico at the Pan American Games. In both the 2011 Pan Am Games and the 2015 Pan Am Games she swept gold in the women's competitions, winning Women's Singles, Women's Doubles as well as the Women's Team event. Samantha Salas was her doubles partner in both years. Longoria has won 9 Pan American Championships ‚Äì 6 in Women's Singles (in 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2015.) and 3 in Women's Doubles (2011, 2012 and 2015, all with Salas). Her 9 Pan Am Championship titles are second most by a woman trailing only American Jackie Paraiso, who's won ten. Longoria is the two time Central American and Caribbean Games gold medalist in Women's Singles, winning in 2010, and 2014, when she also won gold in Women's Doubles with Salas. Longoria has won two gold medals at the World Games. In 2009, she defeated American Rhonda Rajsich in the final and in 2013, beat Cristina Amaya in the final. In 2017, Longoria lost to Rhonda Rajsich (USA) in the final of the Pan American Championships in San Jose, Costa Rica, 7-15, 15-13, 11-9, which ended a string of 10 consecutive Women's Singles gold medals for Longoria at international events dating back to 2011, when she lost to Rajsich in the semi-finals of the Pan American Championships. However, Longoria and Samantha Salas won Women's Doubles in San Jose, defeating Veronica Sotomayor and Maria Paz Mu√±oz in the final, 15-12, 15-5. In 2018, Longoria lost a round robin match at the Pan American Championships in Temuco, Chile to Maria Jose Vargas, 12-15, 15-13, 11-9. The loss meant Longoria was not the #1 for the elimination round. Neverthessless, she reached the final, including a win over teammate Samantha Salas in the semi-finals, 15-12, 15-6. The final was a repeat of the 2017 final, and so was the outcome, as Longoria again lost to Rajsich, 15-3, 14-15, 11-7. Although Longoria was a silver medalist in singles in Temuco, she won gold in Women's Doubles, as she and Alexandra Herrera defeated a Guatemala team of Gabriela Martinez and Maria Renee Rodriguez in the final, 9-15, 15-1, 11-8. As a junior player, Longoria won eight consecutive International Racquetball Federation (IRF) World Junior Championships from 2001 to 2008, winning twice in each age  12 and under, 14 and under, 16 and under, and 18 and under.

Buddhist mummies, also called flesh body bodhisattvas, full body sariras, or living buddhas (Sokushinbutsu) refer to the bodies of Buddhist monks and nuns that remain incorrupt, without any traces of deliberate mummification by another party. Many were destroyed or lost to history. In 2015, the Hungarian Natural History Museum exhibited a Buddhist mummy hidden inside a statue of Buddha, during its first tour outside China. Methods It is a common method in China. Some covered the bodies with clay or salt. According to Victor H. Mair in the Discovery Channel series The Mystery of the Tibetan Mummy, the self-mummification of a Tibetan monk, who died ca. 1475 and whose body was retrieved relatively incorrupt in the 1990s, was achieved by the sophisticated practices of meditation, coupled with prolonged starvation and slow self- suffocation using a special belt that connected the neck with his knees in a lotus position.Trekker finds Buddhist Lama mummy in a mountain hideaway in North India.

They were then buried alive in a pine-wood box full of salt connected by a tube for air, and would ring a bell signaling they were alive. When the bell stopped ringing, the air tube would be removed. Japan banned unburying in 1879, and assisted suicide‚Äîincluding religious suicide‚Äîis now illegal.

Its southern terminus is at Interstate 70 (I-70) in Wheat Ridge, and its northern terminus is at SH 7 east of Allenspark. View of Continental Divide from State Highway 72 west of Wondervu Route description SH 72 looking west as it enters Coal Creek Canyon, just to the west of the intersection with SH 93 The route is a mainly rural, scenic, mountainous highway; not having many junctions. It begins at I-70 (Exit 266) in Wheat Ridge as Ward Road. It continues north through the western parts of Arvada where it becomes Coal Creek Canyon Rd. The highway continues west-north-west through Coal Creek Canyon and aptly named Wondervu, across the Union Pacific Railroad tracks at Pinecliffe, eventually joining the Peak to Peak Scenic Byway northbound. For three miles along the Byway it coincides with SH 119. The two routes diverge at Nederland. From Nederland, SH 72 continues north along the Byway past Ward to its terminus with SH 7 east of Allenspark. History The route was established in the 1920s, when it began at 46th Avenue in Denver and headed northwest to Nederland. The section of the present-day SH 72 north of Nederland was designated as SH 160. By 1936, the southeastern terminus had been moved to SH 58, itself since relocated. The section from SH 93 east was paved by 1946, and the route was paved entirely by 1958. In 1968, SH 160 was deleted and SH 72 took the route from Nederland to Raymond.

The habitat is rainforest on the poorer sedimentary soils. The natural range of distribution is from the Wangat River (32¬∞ S) in the Barrington Tops to the Logan River (27¬∞ S) in south eastern Queensland. This tree was named after Carl Meissner, a Swiss botanist.  Description  Cryptocarya meissneriana is a small tree, reaching 10 metres in height and with a trunk diameter of 25 cm. The bark is brown, mostly smooth with vertical lines of bumps. Leaves alternate, simple, narrow, with a prominent tip. Not particularly thick as the common name might suggest, 5 to 9 cm long. Glossy green above, paler below. Sometimes glaucous underneath. The mid vein is depressed on the upper surface and raised on the lower side of the leaf. Small branches are smooth and green. Tiny, pale green or cream flowers form on panicles in the months of October to January. The fruit is a black fleshy drupe, around 15 mm long. Like many Australian Cryptocarya, the fruit is ribbed and pointed. Fruit matures from March to April. Regeneration from fresh seed is slow but fairly reliable. Removal of the fleshy black aril is advised to assist germination. flowers of the Thick leaved Laurel References External links * Trees of Australia Flora of New South Wales Flora of Queensland Laurales of Australia meissneriana ","title":"Cryptocarya meissneriana"},{"id":"23737417","text":"The Komatsu D475A is the second largest bulldozer in the Komatsu line after the D575A, the world's largest production bulldozer.
