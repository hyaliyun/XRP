Time's Up! at City Hallprotesting and celebrating the extension of the Spitzer agreement to protect and save community gardens Time's Up! Environmental Organization was founded in 1987 to help educate New Yorkers about environmental awareness. One of its main focuses is to promote non-polluting transportation, by advocating biking. Among other activities, Time's Up! helped found New York City's Pedicab industry, and takes an active role in maintaining community gardens. Recent initiatives include supporting the Occupy Wall Street movement and the Museum of Reclaimed Urban Space. Time's Up! is run completely by volunteers, currently with over 150. Time's Up! also has a video documentary team. Dr. Michael Nash, the director of Tamiment Library, wrote: ‚ÄúTime's Up has been at the center of a new generation of activist politics in New York.\\" History=Early years Time's Up! Environmental Group was founded in New York City in 1987. Since 1991, Time's Up! has been campaigning to promote hybrid vehicles, pedal assist technologies, and advocacy of biking. Time's Up! holds a monthly moonlight ride in Central Park to raise environmental awareness. These group bike rides create a safe place for people to cycle together because it is an auto-free ride. This helps establish everyday commuters and has helped continuously increase cycling every year. In 1992, Time's Up! assisted with Green Apple Map, which pinpointed 145 sites in New York City that have made an environmental impact and have sparked a local-global movement. Time's Up! launched a campaign to reclaim public space from automobiles, including a traffic calming ride in Central Park, advocating auto-free streets, and encouraging sustainable infrastructure. Reclaim the Street, Time's Square: this action in addition to the monthly critical mass rides lead towards Time's Square's eventually denial of cars. The Hub Station, 81 East 3rd Street in New York CityIn 1994, Time's Up! volunteers, working with the Hub Station, founded the Pedicab industry in New York City. Pedicabs operate similar to a taxi in that they pick up passengers, though without the pollution associated with motorized taxis. In 1994, mostly in pieces, 12 pedicabs were brought into NYC with the idea of test marketing them. George Bliss, from the Hub Station, was one of the early pioneers of this project, working with Time's Up! volunteers and a donated space by Light Wheels on Crosby Street, NYC. At the Crosby Street space, Time's Up! began to put together the pedicabs, and started introducing them to the streets. Pedicabs have struggled building up their presence in New York, especially when the city installed roadblocks and tried to put a cap on them. Early image from Time's Up's founding of the Pedi Cab industry in New York City. However, thanks to the support of many Time's Up! volunteers, pedicabs prevailed, and they are all over New York, replacing toxic carbon combustion with clean human powered energy. In 1996, Time's Up! worked with the Wetlands Activism Collective on their awareness campaign. Time's Up! started the Street Memorial Project beginning in 1996. This project commemorated cyclists and pedestrians killed by motorists while raising awareness of unsafe local infrastructure. In 1999, Time's Up! teamed up with a coalition to cultivate some community gardens and protect endangered ones. This project also created dozens of new gardens with Time's Up! volunteers and community support. Time's Up! is a part of many other community garden cleanups as well. 2000s and beyond In 2004, Time's Up! hosted the Bike National Convention. Also in 2004, Time's Up! helped launch a bicycle co-op in downtown Manhattan in space donated by Steve Stollman. The co-op offered workshops 5 nights a week showing riders how to repair their bicycles in a skilled share format.Time's Up! bike repair class in Williamsburg, Brooklyn This indoor space also housed a video-editing studio, puppet/prop making, offices, weekly educational movie nights, and eco-seminars. Memorial street stenciling and ghost bike campaign help lead to safer urban design. In 2005, Time's Up teamed up with Visual Resistance to begin the white Ghost Bike Project. Ghost bikes are memorials placed at sites of accidents involving bicycles. In 2006, Time's Up! campaigned in defence of New Yorker's First Amendment Rights. Part of these rights are the freedom of speech and public assembly. Included in that are the rights to protect bicyclists riding together in a group and the growth of the Pedi-cab movement. Time's Up's first amendment lawyer, Norman Siegel, the NYC Bar association, and the National Lawyers Guild helped out with this campaign.Time's Up's Brooklyn space In 2008, Time's Up! opened its Manhattan space, located at ABC NoRio community center on 156 Rivington Street. The Brooklyn space on 99 South 6th Street opened in 2010. In 2011, Times Up! stepped up their efforts on education and direct action towards renewable energy by pointing out the harmful effects of fossil fuels and nonrenewable energy sources. They began a partnership with Viridian Energy, a wind power company. They campaigned against nuclear power. In one campaign, they worked with Clearwater Environmental Organizations to focus on shutting down the Indian Point power plant. Later in the year, Times Up! at the Brooklyn location created its own mechanical energy using energy bikes. Volunteers designed these bikes to generate electricity. Time's Up helped begin a new history museum called The Museum of Reclaimed Urban Space, where we can further document our grassroots success stories and educate the future generation on the importance of the environment and urban design.Also in 2011, Times Up! helped create educational materials on environmental issues as part of the Occupy Wall Street movement. As the movement continued, people living in Zuccotti Park needed their bikes to be repaired. Time's Up! brought tools and parts to hold free fix-your-bike workshops. One of Time's Up's events is the annual Occupy Fountain Ride. The fourth annual ride was held in 2012. Time's Up! utilizes privately owned public spaces such as Zuccotti Park that contain fountains by swimming in them. In 2012, Time's Up! helped launch an innovative museum in New York City's Lower East Side called the Museum of Reclaimed Urban Space (MoRUS). MoRUS is a living archive of the Lower East Side's squats and community gardens. It will display photographs, posters, underground newspapers etc. to show how local residents cleaned up vacant lots and buildings and created organized spaces for the community. The museum's tentative opening date is late July 2012. Time's Up! is helping fundraise for the museum by spreading the word through documenting the construction process. Also in 2012, Time's Up introduced the 1000 Dutch-Style Bike Program, refurbishing used city-friendly bicycles to promote environmentally friendly transportation.times-up.org/news/times-1000-dutch-style-bike-program ReferencesExternal links Time's Up!

It also contained Fort Prospect, Fort Langton, and Fort Hamilton, as well as being the base for mobile artillery batteries, manned by the Royal Artillery (from 1899 to 1924, the Royal Garrison Artillery). Outlying parts of the camp were disposed of in the early decades of the Twentieth Century as the garrison in Bermuda was reduced. The core area, including the barracks, passed to the local government when the garrison was withdrawn in 1957. History=Military in Bermuda prior to the development of Prospect Camp The Bermuda Garrison was built up from the 1790s onwards, paralleling the development of the Royal Navy facilities in Bermuda. Following US independence, which cost the Royal Navy all of its continental bases between the Maritimes and Florida (the latter of which would also pass to the United States), Bermuda, located 640 miles off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, became very important to the Royal Navy, which began buying up tracts of land around the colony. Although the West End had been identified immediately as the ideal location for a dockyard and naval base, no passage through the encircling reefs large enough to allow ships-of-the-line to access the West End, the Great Sound, and Hamilton Harbour was then known. The navy spent a dozen years charting the reefs around Bermuda in search of a passage. Meanwhile, it concentrated its establishment in St. George's Harbour, buying land in and around St. George's Town. With most of the military fortifications built previously by the militia already clustered around the East End, as well, the British Army built up a large garrison, with headquarters and barracks, to the north of the town. Many forts, batteries and other smaller sites were scattered about Bermuda, but most of the army's manpower was in St. George's Garrison. Development of the camp By 1812, the navy was developing the new Royal Navy Dockyard at the West End, on Ireland Island. The new town of Hamilton, located in the central parishes, and to which the colony's capital moved from St. George's in 1815, was achieving increasing prominence thanks to the same channel which allowed development of the dockyard. It became necessary to redeploy much of the military force in Bermuda westward, nearer to the new capital and the dockyard. Consequently, in the middle of the 19th century, the army purchased land on White Hill in Devonshire, and began the development of a large camp, with barracks to house the bulk of the infantry soldiers in Bermuda. Called Prospect Camp, it contained the headquarters of Bermuda's military garrison, barracks, parade grounds, training areas, and a fort. Prospect Fort was manned by the garrison units of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, later known as the Royal Garrison Artillery (this was one of three forts whose coastal artillery was intended to complement each other's with overlapping fire to guard the shores and the overland approaches to Hamilton, the others being Fort Hamilton and Fort Langton). Although Prospect Camp had extensive areas for training, it was surrounded by public roads and residential areas, and had no safe area for a rifle range. Consequently, a second camp, Warwick Camp, was added primarily to provide rifle ranges to the soldiers of the garrison, and the dockyard's own Royal Marine detachment (and those of the ships stationed there). Warwick Camp had no units permanently assigned to it, however, with different units deploying there specifically for periods of training. Various other smaller sites were used by the Army over the history of the garrison. These included Watford Island and Boaz Island, both part of the Admiralty land holdings attached to the HM Dockyard, where Clarence Barracks had been erected to re- house convicts labourers (sent to Bermuda to take part in the construction of the Royal Naval Dockyard) previously accommodated on prison hulks. After the last convicts were removed from Bermuda in the 1860s, Boaz and Watford Islands were transferred to the army and housed a considerable number of soldiers (there being capacity for a battalion of infantry plus detachments from other corps). Bermuda was divided into three military districts, centred (from West to East) on Clarence Barracks, Prospect Camp, and St. George's Garrison, with overall Command Headquarters at Prospect Camp. Use of the camp Governor and General Officer Commanding, Lieutenant-General Sir Denis Bernard, inspects the First Contingent of the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps to the Lincolnshire Regiment at Prospect Camp on 22 June 1940. 3rd Battalion of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment on parade at Prospect Camp, circa 1902. Governor of Bermuda Lieutenant-General Sir Louis Bols takes salute at Prospect Camp in 1930 Through much of the 19th century, a full battalion of infantry soldiers was based in Bermuda, along with various artillery, engineer, and other support units. By the 1860s, financial constraints, the intention to redeploy more of the British Army in Britain to guard against invasion, and the intention to compose what would come to be known as the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), meant the garrison in Bermuda was scheduled for reduction. With Bermuda remaining an important naval base, however, the regular soldiers were obliged to remain in full strength for many years, until the government of Bermuda could be induced to raise part-time units, the Bermuda Militia Artillery and the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps, to take on part of the responsibilities of the garrison. From then on, the regular soldiers in Bermuda were slowly whittled away. Between the two world wars, the regular Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers were withdrawn completely, handing their responsibilities entirely to the BMA and the Bermuda Volunteer Engineers. Although regular infantry soldiers remained, Bermuda no longer had a full garrison, and only a detached company was posted to Prospect Camp. As a new battalion deployed to Jamaica, it detached a company in Bermuda along the way. During the Second World War, in addition to housing the headquarters and the regular infantry, the camp was also used for training overseas contingents from the part-time units (which had been embodied on a full-time basis for the duration of the war). The First Contingent of the BVRC, which left Bermuda to join the Lincolnshire Regiment in England, trained at Prospect Camp, along with several volunteers from the BMA and BVE who travelled with them to England, before detaching to join their larger corps. In 1943 Prospect Camp housed the Training Battalion, a temporary force composed of volunteers from the BVRC, the BMA and the Bermuda Militia Infantry, to train for deployment overseas. The battalion then split into two contingents; the Second Contingent of the BVRC which joined the Lincolnshire Regiment in Britain, and the Bermuda Militia contribution to the new Caribbean Regiment, for which it provided the Training Cadre, which was raised in North Carolina. Withdrawal of garrison and closure of the camp The Guard House at Prospect Camp, Devonshire, Bermuda in 2011 In 1951 it was announced that the Royal Navy's dockyard would be closed, a process that stretched throughout the 1950s, and left only a reduced resupply base, HMS Malabar, which operated until 1995. Without the dockyard, and with large naval and air bases of NATO ally, the USA, located in Bermuda, the military garrison became unnecessary. The last Imperial Defence Plan was issued in 1953. After that, the local part-time units ceased to have any role assigned by the War Office (or its successor, the Ministry of Defence). The last regular detachment, a company of the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry (DCLI), was withdrawn in 1957, following which Prospect Camp, along with most of the military and admiralty properties in Bermuda were transferred to the local government for ¬£750,000. Post-military usage Following its transfer to the local government, Prospect Camp has been split between a number of government departments and private owners. The Bermuda Police Service has been the primary occupant, housing its headquarters, barracks, and various sub-units there. The Department of Education has also made considerable use of former camp grounds, having housed Prospect Secondary School in former barracks buildings, and having originally sited the campus of the Bermuda College there. In the 1990s, several barracks and other buildings were levelled, and the new Cedarbridge Academy was built in their place. The National Stadium also occupies part of the former military camp.

Corman used it to make and distribute his own movies, as opposed to ones he was making for American International Pictures.

The company ultimately folded, however, lessons from running the company helped Corman make a success later of New World Pictures (now part of Disney's 20th Century Fox). Filmgroup also produced early feature work of Francis Ford Coppola, Peter Bogdanovich, Charles B. Griffith, Curtis Harrington, Jack Hill, Monte Hellman, Robert Towne and Jack Nicholson. History Corman established his own company, Palo Alto Productions, in 1954, which was responsible for his first two movies. Filmgroup came out of a desire for Corman to move into distribution. In February 1959 Filmgroup announced they would release ten films. Their first movies were High School Big Shot (1959) and T-Bird Gang (1959) produced by Stanley Bickman.

It is surrounded by Antarctic Beech cool temperate rainforest at an altitude of 985 metres above sea level. The swamp and surrounding forest was part of Chichester State Forest. However, in the 1980s the boundaries of the Barrington Tops National Park were moved to include the area to the World Heritage Gondwana Rainforests of Australia.New South Wales Rainforests - The Nomination for the World Heritage List, Paul Adam, 1987. , page 77 The adjacent forest contains very tall Antarctic Beech trees, some as old as 2000 years.CMA Barrington Tops Gloucester Map - Department of Lands NSW Govt Mosses and ferns are prominent. Other tree species near the lake include Golden Sassafras, Soft Corkwood, Prickly Ash, Possumwood and Mountain Walnut. The swamp was formed when a landslip fell from the western side of Mount Lumeah. The area initially filled as a lake. Then the basin filled with organic and sedimentary material. The swamp is vegetated by a variety of sedges and grasses. The swamp is of interest to palaeobotanists as the pollen records reveal a history of previous vegetation and clues to an earlier climate. Pollen samples indicated the dominance of the Antarctic Beech for only 6,000 years at this site. 17,000 years ago at the Last Glacial Maximum this area was much colder and with a lower rainfall. Soft Tree Ferns became common 13,000 years ago. Nothofagus appeared around 11,500 years ago and has only dominated the area for a surprisingly short period when the rainfall and temperatures were higher. The pollen sampling gives a good indication of the botany of the area for the past 40,000 years. In the colder days of the Last Glacial Maximum, the vegetation was mostly drier alpine plants.

There is little documentation of the birth of Hans Clemer. The first records date from the late fifteenth century. The artistic career of Hans Clemer shows an articulate culture, attentive to innovative technical solutions, in which there are references to his contemporary Giovanni Martino Spanzotti. A document found in Aix-en-Provence, speaks about two painters, Josse Lieferinxe and Mestre Ans and contains an agreement between the two artists, linked by kinship and the leader of the Brotherhood of St. Anthony of Padua, the monastery of Aix, for the realization of a work representing the saint. To the end of the fifteenth century Clemer seems to be already in service in the valleys of the marquisate of Saluzzo and in particular, in Maira Valley, in the parish church of Elva, in which it is possible to see the cycle of frescoes depicting scenes from the life of Mary and a Crucifixion, dating from 1493. Those two works are still well preserved in the choir and apse of the church, a beautiful building in the style of the late Romanesque period. This masterpiece has earned him the title of Master of Elva, but the artist's presence in much of the territory of the marquisate is proved by a series of works ranging from the religious subject to historical and mythological representations. Soon, he was called to work even in the capital of the marquisate: Saluzzo. Here Hans Clemer made his last works commonly dated to the period 1511-1512. Beyond the paintings on the facade of the cathedral of Saluzzo, Clemer also created the decoration of the house and the magnificent Altarpiece of Our Lady of Mercy in the Cavassa house.

(1997) The Atlas of Southern African Birds. Vols 1 and 2, BirdLife South Africa, Johannesburg, South Africa Because a new bird atlas was started in southern Africa in 2007, the earlier project is now referred to as SABAP1. The new atlas project is known as the Second Southern African Bird Atlas Project, and is abbreviated to SABAP2. SABAP2 is still ongoing. It is now managed by the FitzPatrick Institute of African Ornithology at the University of Cape Town. Most of the data capture happens through the application BirdLasser. The project is currently funded by BirdLife South Africa and the South African National Biodiversity Institute. SABAP covered six countries: Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, Eswatini and Zimbabwe. At the time, Mozambique was engulfed in a civil war, and had to be excluded. The resolution for SABAP1 was the quarter degree grid cell (QDGC), 15 minutes of latitude by 15 minutes of longitude, 27.4 km north-south and about 25 km east-west, an area of about 700 km¬≤. However, in Botswana a half degree grid cell was used. The total number of grid cells, taking account of the coarser resolution in Botswana, was 3973. Fieldwork was conducted mainly in the five-year period 1987-1991, but the project coordinators included all suitable data collected from 1980-1987\\\\. In some areas, particularly those that were remote and inaccessible, data collection continued until 1993. Fieldwork was undertaken mainly by birders, and most of it was done on a volunteer basis. Fieldwork consisted of compiling bird lists for the QDGCs. All the checklists were fully captured into a database. The final dataset consisted of 147 605 checklists, containing a total of 7.3 million records of bird distribution. Of the total 3973 QDGCs, only 88 had no checklists (2.2% of the total). Project coordination was undertaken by the Avian Demography Unit (ADU) at the University of Cape Town. The unit changed its name in 2008 to Animal Demography Unit, to reflect its expanding ambit, but retained the acronym ADU. The Animal Demography Unit was closed down in 2018. The final product of the project was a two-volume set of A4-sized books, covering 932 species, with a total of 1500 pages, published in 1997 by BirdLife South Africa. The books are now out of print, but the individual species texts are available on the SABAP2 website. Volume 1 also contains a chapter on the relevance of southern African geography to birds. The Atlas of Southern African Birds was, at the time of publication, the largest biodiversity project ever conducted in Africa. This project showed that birdlife in southern Africa reflects the wide diversity of habitats in the region: 9% of the world's bird species are regularly found there, even though it constitutes only 1.67% of the world's land area. The impact of the project on southern African ornithology was considerable. The species texts did not only provide information on distribution, but also presented new information and analyses on the seasonality of breeding and the direction and seasonality of migration. SABAP therefore became an essential reference for all research involving these fundamental aspects of avian biology.Harrison, J.A., Underhill, L.G. & Barnard, P. 2008.

He had the diocesan agenda printed by Peter DrachArticle Drach, Peter in: Rudolf Schmidt: Deutsche Buchh√§ndler. Deutsche Buchdrucker.

It was erected in a cloister on the south side of Speyer Cathedral. The cloister was destroyed in a fire in 1689; the Mount of Olives was damaged, but exists until this day. From 1510 onwards, Philip I sent his Canon Philip II of Flersheim, the future bishop, as his envoy to important meetings, such as the Imperial Diets of 1512 in Trier and Cologne. As Zimmern mentioned, Philip published a diocesan agenda with a pastoral theological chapter. He exhorted the priests in his diocese to adopt the diocesan breviary and to follow the diocesan rites and customs in their liturgy. He ordered the clergy to buy his liturgical books, in particular the breviary he had published in Venice. The memoirs of Albert of RosenbergCentral Archive of Hohenlohe in Neuenstein from Boxberg relate how in 1507 Philip I mediated in a family dispute between the brothers Frederick and Arnold of Rosenberg about the inheritance of George of Rosenberg. Bishop Philip I of Rosenberg died in 1513 in Udenheim, only 53 years old. He was buried in the cloister of Speyer Cathedral.  Coat of arms  Philip's coat of arms is usually quartered. Two fields show the von Rosenberg family crest, alternating red and silver stripes. The other two fields show the arms of the Bishopric of Speyer, a silver cross on a blue background.

They travelled via China and Ulaanbaatar, and established themselves in what is today Erdenebulgan sum in Kh√∂vsg√∂l province. However, the dairy farm project failed due to Mongolia coming under stronger Soviet influence, and Haslund left Outer Mongolia in the mid-1920s. Fascinated by the Mongol way of life, Haslund remained in Inner Mongolia for the following years, e.g. joining Sven Hedin for the Sino-Swedish Scientific Expedition of the late 1920s. After the war, Haslund organised and led the Third Danish Expedition to Central Asia, which lasted six years. A first team, consisting of anthropologists, botanists, geographers, and zoologists would work during 1948 and 1949 in Afghanistan, from Nuristan in the east to Herat in the west, under his leadership. This would extend scientific knowledge to the south-east of the Pamirs and Iran explored respectively by Ole Olufsen in 1896-7 and C. G. Feilberg in 1936. Unfortunately, Haslund's death in 1948 left the Expedition leaderless and the expedition members finished their work as best they could. A new leader was appointed in 1950 but the rest of the plan for the expedition was never accomplished due to the political situation from 1950 onwards.\\"The Third Danish Expedition to Central Asia: Its Work in the Himalayas\\", The Himalayan Journal 18.

The GC box is upstream of the TATA box and approximately 110 bases upstream from the transcription initiation site. It has a consensus sequence GGGCGG which is position dependent and orientation independent. The GC elements are bound by transcription factors and have similar functions to enhancers. Some known GC box-binding proteins include Sp1, Krox/Egr, Wilms' tumor, MIGI, and CREA. The GC box is commonly the binding site for Zinc finger proteins. An Alpha helix section of the protein corresponds with a major groove in the DNA. Zinc- fingers bind to triplet base pair sequences, with residue 21 binding to the first base pair, residue 18 binding to the second base pair, and residue 15 binding to the third base pair. The triplet base pairs can either be a GGG or a GCG. If residue 18 is a histidine, it will bind to a G, and if residue 18 is a glutamic acid, it will bind to a C.

There have been a few recent academic journals looking into the benefits that using crowdsourcing as a translation technique could bring to the current approach to the task, and how it could help improve and make more efficient the current tools available to the public. Crowdsourcing in translation=Technologies translated through crowdsourcing *Ubuntu Known as a distribution of Linux, the translation of this open-source system is often carried out by individual users who have a desire to use it in their mother tongue. *Google The service \\"Google in your own language\\" (GIYL) was a project which was translated by both users and translation volunteers. *Facebook In March 2008, through crowdsourcing, the entire site was translated into French within 24 hours by allegedly over 4,000 native French speakers. *Klingon Language Institute This language institute, based on the fictional language heard in Star Trek, provides a forum to its members for discussion and interaction with other fellow enthusiasts. *dotSUB Partnered with TED (conference) as its technological partner, dotSUB developed a \\"browser based, one-stop, self contained system for creating and viewing subtitles for videos in multiple languages across all platforms, including web based, mobile devices, and transcription and video editing systems\\" *Worldwide Lexicon An open source collaborative translation platform, Worldwide Lexicon (WWL) consider themselves to be \\"a translation memory, essentially a giant database of translations, which can be embedded in almost any website or web application\\" through the use of a browser plugin. Advantages Crowdsourcing translation is considered to be highly efficient, thanks to their threefold advantages: *Multilingual support Through human or manual translation, there are no boundaries or limitations to the languages or dialects the source text can be translated into. Through crowdsourcing, the creation of a large base of translators with a large variety of native tongues provides the possibility for the original text to be translated into many different languages. *Quick solution If the text provided is submitted as an open source, the time in which it is translated could be within only a few minutes (if the text in question is relatively small). This is due to the large number of people who have access to the task. Despite varying levels of competency within the users, an accurate translation is usually reached due to the sheer number of participants that would be able to correct and overrule mistakes. However, communication between large numbers of people would be difficult to co- ordinate effectively. *Monetary benefits The company which implements the crowdsourcing is considered to be the main benefactor, due to the low cost of maintaining a crowdsourcing platform once it has been set up. Translators on open sources are not generally considered to be freelancers or professional translators; rather hobbyists who are willing to translate for free. Challenges *Technological boundaries Crowdsourcing tends to only be effective to its fullest extent when employed on the internet. This renders groups of people who are not internet-savvy, or even without free, reliable access to the internet under-represented in crowdsourcing. Therefore, valid and perhaps important dialects could be omitted from the results. Time zone barriers also play an important role in delay in the delivery time of the final product, and should be taken into consideration. *Quality Research into specifically the quality of Wikipedia \\"concluded that adding more editors to an article improved article quality only when they used appropriate coordination techniques and was harmful when they did not.\\". The most important issue to take into account is the aforementioned unprofessionalism of the open source translators the text is released to, thus creating somewhat variable results. *Motivation Without a source of motivation, obtaining usable results from a crowdsourcing project is almost impossible. It is vital to create interest and enthusiasm within the group of people in order to maintain their commitment to the project. Therefore, rewards are often offered for the best contributions. *Control As the following for a project increases, the ability to control and manage the group decreases, leading to an unorganised and chaotic result, and can therefore be very time consuming and high cost. Crowdsourcing vs. Machine Translation The main difference between these two techniques is that crowdsourcing is human-generated translation, whilst MT is automated by a computer, although both share similarities. A concise table is available in Crowdsourcing as Human-Machine Translation by Anastasiou and Gupta: { border=\\"1\\" + Crowdsourcing Translation vs. Machine Translation ! scope=\\"col\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\"  Crowdsourcing Translation ! scope=\\"col\\"  Machine Translation - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Start  2006  1955 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Output \\"engine\\"  Humans  Computer software - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Human involvement  Always  At revision - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Control  No  Yes - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Terminological consistency  No  Yes - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Source text  Uncontrolled  Controlled - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Speed  Less than MT  High - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Cost  Low implementation cost  Acquisition cost of commercial systems - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Quality  High  Low - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Profit  Company profits  MT user (single person or company) profits } Future Prospects Anastasious and Gupta believe that in the future, both advantages of using crowdsourcing and machines in translating will merge to form an efficient, cost-effective and high quality translation service.

Over the arch of the chancel we see the Trinity, comprising Father, Son and Holy Spirit, set within a triple mandorla. Beneath and to the left are the souls of the saved, and to the right, probably the souls of the damned (one seemingly wearing a crown). Further down and to the left are a well-preserved set of figures holding scrolls, which might be construed as apostles or saints, and to the right a badly damaged matching group of figures that some have interpreted as demons, but which may represent the remaining six apostles, making twelve in all. Beneath and to the left is a scene depicting the Raising of the Dead. File:Houghton-on-the-Hill (Norfolk) St Mary's Church - geograph.org.uk - 69011.jpg St Mary's church.

Soon they discover that the furs are being smuggled into a storehouse on the ranch and then shipped out of the country. While preparing to escort another shipment of pelts, the smugglers discover Gene and Frog in the storeroom and, deciding to use Gene as a cover for their illegal activities, hijack him and his wagon. After the smugglers leave, Frog escapes from the storeroom and organizes a rescue party to search for Gene and his captors. As the smugglers hold up another warehouse of furs, Gene escapes and tries to prevent the robbery, but is shot in the arm. He manages to sound the alarm and then follows after the smugglers by dogsled. After catching up to the thieves, Gene sees them loading the furs into Hendricks' car.

The station was built by the Severn and Wye Railway which ran from Berkeley Road, over the Severn Railway Bridge between Sharpness and Lydney, following the route of the River Lyd to Parkend and finally onto Cinderford. The station was situated on the south side of the Speech House Road (now the B4226). The station consisted of one platform with a small building, a passing loop, a signal box opposite the platform building, next to the road crossing. It also had a small goods yard with a facilities for coal, timber and general freight, the station being home to a wooden derrick crane. The Seven and Wye Railway opened the station as a halt in 1875. The facilities were then expanded by 1878. Cannop Colliery closed in 1960, removing most of the freight traffic that passed through the facilities. In 1963 the line was closed north of Coleford Junction.  Current usage  Nothing remains of the station except the track bed (which is in use as a cycle track). A rail and sleeper name board marks the location of the platform (and the altitude at 78 m / 256 feet) and a pair of false wooden crossing gates - marking where the cycle track crosses the B4226. The Dean Forest Railway (based at Norchard) plans to eventually extend a further 2¬Ω miles to the site at Speech House Road, (bringing the line up to total of 6¬æ miles in length).

Early life He was born in London to tailor Joseph Levy and Esther, n√©e Cohen. He arrived in Sydney in 1880 and attended Crown Street Superior School, Sydney Grammar School and the University of Sydney, graduating with a first in Bachelor of Arts (Honours) in 1893 and a Bachelor of Law in 1895, in which year he was called to the Bar. In 1902 he was admitted as a solicitor. Levy was active in Jewish affairs and was co-editor of the Australasian Hebrew newspaper in 1896 with Percy J. Marks. Political career He entered the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1901 as the Liberal member for Sydney-Fitzroy, transferring to Darlinghurst in 1904 (he would represent Sydney for the period of proportional representation from 1920 to 1927, Paddington from 1927 to 1930, and Woollahra thereafter). In 1919, Levy, despite being a Nationalist, accepted the position of Speaker of the Legislative Assembly from James Dooley's Labor government, provoking discontent within his own party. He resigned with the fall of the government in 1920, was re-appointed by George Fuller for his seven hours as premier, and continued the position when Dooley resumed the premiership later the same day. Becoming known as a scrupulously independent Speaker, Levy advocated the British model of Speakership in which the Speaker's seat was uncontested, and made efforts to have this practice adopted by statute. He was Speaker until 1925, served again from 1927 to 1930, and served briefly in Bertram Stevens' 1932 emergency cabinet as Minister for Justice and Attorney-General. Resuming the Speakership in 1932, he held the position until his death in 1937 at Darling Point. Levy was knighted in 1929 for his service as Speaker.

Mauritania and Chad recorded a loss in crop yield of over 50% when compared to 2011. Food reserves in the areas affected were very low and combined with corn prices soaring by 60-85% compared to averages over the last five years.

It consists mainly of ice age depositions, that were left behind after the glacier thawed. It is one of three island cores of the Hiddensee responsible for the emergence of the lowland. The Dornbusch measures about 2.45 kilometres from north to south and about 2.85 kilometres from east to west. Its highest point, at 72 metres above sea level, is the Schluckswiekberg, on which the Dornbusch Lighthouse, the symbol of Hiddensee, stands. With much of its cliffed coast still active it represents an important landscape in the West Pomeranian Lagoon Area National Park and is part of protection zone II. Numerous footpaths run through its varied countryside.  History  An oil drilling tower in May 1967 in the vicinity of the Enddorn The formation of the uplands goes back to the last glaciation phase in northern Germany, the Weichselian. The Dornbusch was created about 12,500 years ago by a small finger of the ice front that left its mark in the present day straits of the Little Belt and Great Belt. During the retreat of the glacier, the uplands were left behind as a push moraine and for about 4,000 years they were part of a large area of the mainland, south of the present Baltic Sea. During the first flooding phase of the Baltic Sea, the water did not reach the area of Hiddensee; it was only about 3,900 years ago that the Littorina Sea lapped the three island cores of Dornbusch, F√§hrinsel and Gellen. And it was just 2,900 years ago that coastal erosion (land erosion, dispersal and deposition) and the formation of the elongated shape of the Hiddensee through sand-accretion began. Under Wallenstein's orders, from 1628 to 1630 the entire oak and beech forest covering the Dornbusch was burned, in order to leave no wood for the construction of ships by the Danes, who were fighting in the region. In fact, the forest had already been at least partly damaged by such action. The supposedly ancient Dornbusch forest is therefore still relatively young; it was only slowly replanted with conifers in 1861, after the first pine plantations had failed in 1780. From 1900, deciduous trees were also planted. Previously, the entire hill country was a belt of treeless grasslands and arable land which was regularly covered by sand in high winds. The felling of individual trees in newly planted forests to meet the demand for fuel resulted in many clearings with much undergrowth. In the 1960s and 1970s, there were four oil wells in the northern Dornbusch, but they were closed shortly thereafter. A separate landing stage was erected at Swedenhagen for the delivery and collection of drilling rigs. In 2009, it was demolished. At the highest borehole location (east of the Swantiberg), a landfill for municipal waste was established. In 1990, work began on cleaning up the landfill before incorporating the site into the national park. But, as before, there is still a problem with rubbish being uncovered as the uplands are progressively eroded. Until 2000 the remains of a World War II bunker, blown up by the Soviet Army, stood on the Enddorn.  Geography  Active cliff at Rennbaumhuk This diagram of a cliffed coast is a good representation of Dornbusch's cliffs The uplands and the Dornbusch Lighthouse ‚Äì May 2011 The Dornbusch extends from the low-lying terrain by the waters of the Vitter Bodden and the village of Kloster in the southeast up to the cliffs in the north, towering 60 metres above the sea, at the foot of which a more or less wide gravel beach has formed. To the south is the adjoining Hiddensee plain and village of Vitte, the dune heath, Neuendorf, and finally the Gellen. From the northeastern point, the Enddorn, two wide, spits, covered by sea buckthorn, stretch southwards: the Altbessin and Neubessin. The Dornbusch consists mainly of alternate layers of glacial till, sand, gravel, and chalk. Glacial erratics on the pebbly beach are evidence of the tremendous forces of the ice masses. The biggest erratic by far is the Bismark Rock at Tiddenufer (north bank of the Hucke); others are the Zeppelin Rock and Saalsteine by the Hucke. Whilst the cliff between the village of Kloster and the north shore of the westernmost bluff (Hucke) is largely inactive due to the construction of a three-metre-high retaining wall, there are often landslides and collapses in the central and northern areas. Here the coast continues to recede as a result of abrasion. Two coastal types can be distinguished. The areas of high cliff that are not in exposed locations (i.e. in the middle part of the cliff) are removed very slowly; even buckthorn bushes sometimes grow on them. By contrast, the lower north shore drops steeply and is mostly clear of any vegetation. Here overhangs and sea caves are frequently formed. Before the construction of the coastal defence wall around the western promontory (Hucke) there were also deep caves there. The entire, gently rolling terrain in the southeast is composed partly of peat deposits and a ground moraine. In the far south of this area, east of the harbour at Kloster, there is a place that rises above the surrounding countryside. The ridge is called Swedenhagen, which is an indication that it supplied pig food in earlier centuries (Swedenhagen = Swinehagen =Schweinehagen =\\"pig mast\\").  Topography  View from the lighthouse towards Swantiberg to the northeast ‚Äì August 2006 On the outer coast of Dornbusch are the following promontories and shore features: * From southwest to northeast: Vorlege, Hucke, Tiddenufer, Rennbaumhuk, Klausnerbr√ºche, Klausnerhuk, Swantevitschlucht, Tietenufer, Signalmasthuk/Flederberghuk, Toter Kerl, Dornbusch (in its true sense), Enddorn. The term Huk or Hucke refers to large cliffed headlands on the Baltic coast. The name \\"Dornbusch\\" is derived from several large thorn bushes that once stood at the top of the cliff and which acted as landmarks for sailors. Later the term was applied to the entire uplands. The Enddorn, formerly also called Endur Endendorn or Entendorn was therefore the (northeast) end of the Dornbusch and still is today. Hills and hillocks (from west to east in each case): * Lower slopes of the Dornbusch: Ecklingsberg, R√ºbenberg, Rabenberg * Uplands (Hochland): Schulterberg, Hexenberg, Aschkoben, Lehmberg, Bakenberg, Schluckswiekberg * on the cliff edge: H√ºbnerberg, Patzenh√∂he, Sandberg, Tannenberg, Flederberg/Fliederberg/Sirenenberg, Swantiberg Valleys (also from west to east): *Hexengrund, Nussschlucht/Walhalla, Tannengrund and Honiggrund All four were formed during the thawing of the ice sheet at the end of the last ice age as periglacial dry valleys. Several hollows, in which rain and meltwaters collected, are scattered around the uplands. These are the Riedsal east of Kloster and the little bogs of Ellesegen, Alten-Diek, Neuer Teich, Gro√üer Gr√ºm-Kierl and Kleiner Gr√ºm-Kierl.  Clifftop dunes  The clifftop dunes are geologically and botanically interesting. Here sand is blown from the beach up the cliff and deposited on the top of the cliff again. Accordingly, the sand is very fine. Large clifftop dunes may be found anywhere between Signalmasthuk and the village of Kloster. The largest by far was the Bismark Dune on the Rennbaumhuk. However, they were fixed in the 1970s with dune fences, to prevent the paths sanding over and slow down the erosion of the cliff. The former treeless dunes are now wooded or covered in bushes (see Flora), but you can still see a small area of such dunes by walking a little further west of the Rennbaumhuk on a narrow path that swings sharply north off a clifftop path.  Flora and fauna  Sea-buckthorn Fly honeysuckle The south-facing Dornbusch slopes have corresponding plant and animal communities.  Flora  Other parts of the lowland (on the south and north east slopes) are used as pasture. As a result of grazing by cattle, horses and sheep this area, as well as the former arable fields, have developed into a calcareous grassland. Its typical plants are the cowslip, houndstooth, cheat grass, wild strawberry, the rare field gromwell, the poisonous common corncockle, smooth rupturewort, field parsley, biting stonecrop, various mulleins, viper's bugloss, long-headed poppy, Centaurium, ragwort and carline thistle. Another common type of vegetation are thorn thickets, consisting of sea buckthorn, elderberry and blackthorn. In many places nitrogen-loving blackberry and nettle bushes are interspersed, for example on the Swantiberg and Honiggrund. From the village of Kloster over the Hucke to the tourist cafe of Zum Klausner in the Tannengrund valley is a mixed wood of Scots pine, beech, English oak, hornbeam, wild cherry, Swedish whitebeam, sycamore maple and Norway maple. In the west - on the former clifftop dunes - field maple, hawthorn, silver birch, hazel, willows, roses, fly honeysuckle, buckthorn, blackthorn (sloe), spindle and alpine currant are mainly found. North of Kloster, in the area of the old bird ornithological station, there are a few large- and small-leaved limes as well as hybrids of both species. Old man's beard, common hop, common polypody, false brome, common twayblade, which has become extremely rare on Hiddensee, and common moonwort, as well as the still common broad-leaved helleborine form an undergrowth. Early bloomers are e. g. wood violet, lesser celandine und ivy-leaved speedwell. The rich orchid communities, for which Hiddensee was formerly well-known have, however, disappeared. The wood on the Schwedenhagen consists of English oak, ash wych elm, and many old wild pears. Particularly common here are early bloomers such as the intermediate corydalis and fern- leaved corydalis. On the central part of the Dornbusch, broom bushes are also botanically important.

The former large colonies of wild rabbits have drastically shrunk as a result of myxomatosis. Hiddensee is especially well known for its many breeding birds. The briars are home to wheatear, lesser whitethroat, whitethroat, red-backed shrike, skylark, yellowhammer and icterine warbler; the Dornbusch Forest to chaffinch, song thrush, blackcap, wood warbler, great spotted woodpecker and wood pigeon. Sand martins and black redstarts nest on the cliff slopes, the redstarts often using abandoned martin holes. Ravens also breed on the cliffs in the vicinity of the Klausner. The wren and the rosefinch prefer the vegetated slopes on the Hucke. The prominent uplands of the Dornbusch are of great importance to migrating birds as an orientation point. On the outer coastline, after strong northwest storms in autumn and winter, Nordic ducks, petrels and shearwaters, and auks are occasionally blown ashore here. For example, there are records of Leach's storm petrel (one bird on 31 December 1961 and one on 17 November 1977), king eider (spring 1901 and 7 to 17 December 1988), Razorbills (e.g. around 20 examples on 1 December 1852) and many others. The sunny slopes attract Mediterranean species; confirmed spots include alpine swift, bee-eater, blue rock thrush und hoopoe.  Coastal defence  The beach of Kloster before the construction of the southern part of the coastal defence wall between 1950 and 1977 ‚Äì looking south Southern end of the coastal defence wall at the Harten Ort in August 2006 ‚Äì looking north to the Hucke Since 1899, several measurements of cliff recession have been made. Consistently, an annual loss of 20 centimetres per year was recorded between the lighthouse and the Swantiberg. On the Enddorn and before the construction of the wall at the Hucke, there was even a loss of 60 centimetres a year. The material eroded from the Dornbusch cliffs is transported by currents to the southeast and southwest and enables both the Hiddensee lowlands on Gellen and the Neubessin to continue to grow. Here a graded shoreline is forming. In probably several thousand years, the entire Dornbusch will have been removed. Along the cliff edge, large masses of glacial till are continually breaking off. From the clifftop path between Enddorn Swantiberg, the abrasion process has been observed clearly for several years. The last major collapses happened in 2000 and 2004 at the Totes Kerl. The only clearly conspicuous coastal defence structure is the 2-kilometre-long stone wall between Rennbaumhuk and Hartem Ort, which at the Hucke has been a height of 3 metres. From 1938 until the war broke out in 1939, the first section at the Hucke was built about 20 yards away from the beach, the narrow water channel between the stone wall and the shore was filled rapidly with sand. Later it was extended to the south. At the Hucke and the beach of Kloster the land had previously retreated very rapidly. The outcome is not purely positive however. The steep coast was indeed successfully protected, but there were still cliff collapses, due to weather conditions, that formed a large alluvial fan. That could not even be washed away in a storm flood because of the wall and it has gradually become overgrown with bushes. As a result, one of the most interesting sections of cliff on Hiddensee was not preserved. In 1937 nine steel sheet groynes were built at the Swantiberg near the lighthouse. They were in the ensuing decades severely damaged, however, and are now barely recognizable. The coastal defence woods afforested in 1861 with pine, oak, hornbeam and hazel on the western side of the Dornbusch protect the area from wind erosion.  Settlements and buildings  On the southern slope of the hill country lies Kloster, the cultural centre of the island. A little further north is the smallest and oldest place on Hiddensee, Grieben. On the uplands are several other isolated buildings, the 18-metre- high Dornbusch Lighthouse, the tourist cafe and bed and breakfast inn, the Klausner. It may be accessed from the beach below the cliffs by steps up the steep wooded slope. Literature  * G√ºnter M√∂bus: Wie Hiddensee zur Insel wurde.

Controversies and legal issues=Murder of Jun Lin In June 2012, the website was criticized for the inclusion of the graphic video titled 1 Lunatic 1 Ice Pick, which depicts the rape and dismemberment of a corpse following the murder of Jun Lin committed by Luka Magnotta. Police said that Marek had initially refused requests to remove the video from the site, while Marek said, \\"I took it down myself, on my own terms, without being asked.\\" Had any such request by police to take it down, as alleged, been made, I would have just told them that the video had been down for days.\\"\\"Statement by Marek\\" August 20, 2013 Gil Zvulony, a Toronto- based lawyer specializing in Internet law, stated that the evidence supported the laying of obscenity charges against Bestgore.com, stating, \\"There's no real crime where there's no knowledge, but once they got notice of that and they allowed it to stay on there, that's where a crime was committed in my view.\\" Corruption of morals charge In June 2012, it was reported that the Service de police de la Ville de Montr√©al was investigating Bestgore.com\\"Best Gore website investigated over Magnotta video\\" CBC.ca.

The rare charge is based on section 163 of the Canadian Criminal Code and carries a maximum sentence of two years' imprisonment. One police investigator described the site as \\"a racist website, inciting hate, hatred, violence‚Äîviolence above and beyond anything normal.\\" Marek was released on bail, but was re-arrested on July 26 for allegedly violating the terms of his release. In January 2016, he pleaded guilty and was given a conditional sentence of three months of house arrest followed by three months of community service. In a November 2013 interview with Adrianne Jeffries of The Verge, Marek said that section 163(1) prohibits distribution of crime comics and methods of curing venereal disease, and noted that the law was enforced selectively and could be used indiscriminately. Marek also defended the value of actually looking at gory material: Marek said that he had received testimonies from readers stating that viewing the images on his site had convinced them to avoid speeding, darting between traffic on motorcycle, horseplay with forklifts, even from committing suicide, and that the government itself recognized the utility of shocking images by requiring them on cigarette packaging.

She took a gold medal at the 2008 Summer Paralympics as a handcyclist, and eight years later at Rio she won gold in the women's single sculls as a rower. She lost both her legs to Complex regional pain syndrome and cycles, in part, to manage the pain. She was born in Guildford, Surrey. Morris won two gold medals at the 2007 World Para-cycling Championships in Bordeaux, France; she won the time trial and road race events in the women's category B races. This made her the first ever British hand-cyclist to be crowned a double World Champion. Morris was named to the team for Great Britain at the 2008 Summer Paralympics, where she competed in the road race and time trial in the HC A/B/C disability category for athletes who use a handcycle. She finished sixth in the road race but won the gold medal in the time trial; her time of 20 minutes 57.09 seconds was nearly three minutes faster than her nearest competitor. At the 2010 UCI Para- cycling Road World Championships held in Baie-Comeau, Canada, Morris won two gold medals. Her first came in the H3 category individual time trial; she won the event by over two minutes in a time of 23 minutes 34.71 seconds. Morris won her second gold medal in the road race, beating silver medallist Sandra Graf by over 80 seconds. Morris was selected to compete for Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Paralympics, where she was aiming to defend her title in the time trial and also to compete in the road race. In July 2012 her participation at the Games was placed in doubt after she was hit by a car during a time trial near her home in Farnham, Surrey. The incident left her with whiplash and shoulder injuries. In addition to her physical injuries Morris' handcycle was damaged in the crash, meaning she had to use her competition bike for training and order a new one for use in the Paralympics. She recovered in time to compete in her first event at the Games on 5 September. In the H1-3 road race at the Games, Morris and team-mate Karen Darke crossed the line together whilst holding hands in order to tie for third place and share the bronze medal: however the photo finish revealed that Morris arrived at the line first, so she alone was awarded third. She subsequently took up rowing, in the ASW1x (arms and shoulders women's single sculls) event, came 5th at the 2014 World Rowing Championships in Amsterdam, and won the silver medal at the 2015 World Rowing Championships at Lac d'Aiguebelette in France, thus qualifying for the 2016 Paralympics. Morris took the gold in the single sculls event at the Games. However Morris was forced to give up the sport after undergoing two shoulder operations after the Games, after which she spent almost a year in hospital recovering. After speaking with former rowing team-mate-turned-cross-country skier Scott Meenagh, Morris turned her attention to skiing, first trying a sit ski in March 2018 and taking up cross-country skiing in November of that year. She made her debut at the World Para Nordic Skiing Championships in 2019 in Prince George, British Columbia.

During his career he was recognized as a talented tag team wrestler despite his small size for a heavyweight, and today he is recognized as a trainer in both professional and amateur wrestling. He is the father of freestyle wrestler Kyoko Hamaguchi.  Career  Hamaguchi debuted in 1969 in the old International Wrestling Enterprise. He was a regular mid-carder although his teams with Sueo Inoue and Rusher Kimura were main event. He also made forays into North American wrestling in the late 1970s, winning titles in Puerto Rico's World Wrestling Council and Canada's Stampede Wrestling. In 1981, when IWE collapsed, Hamaguchi teamed with Kimura and Isamu Teranishi in an \\"invasion\\" angle in New Japan Pro Wrestling. When the angle was dropped, Hamaguchi joined Riki Choshu in forming the original Ishin Gundan rebel stable. In 1984 Ishin Gundan left NJPW and formed Japan Promotion, which eventually became a mere stable of All Japan Pro Wrestling. AJPW promoted Giant Baba ordered Choshu to replace Hamaguchi, who was rather small-sized, with rookie Yoshiaki Yatsu in order to feud with Jumbo Tsuruta and Genichiro Tenryu in the upper card. Hamaguchi thus reformed his team with Inoue in the lower card. After Japan Pro Wrestling broke up and Choshu and others went back to NJPW in 1987, Hamaguchi chose to retire. In 1990 he returned as Big Van Vader's partner against Antonio Inoki and Tiger Jeet Singh in Inoki's 30th anniversary match. Hamaguchi competed sporadically until settling in Tenryu's WAR in 1993. In his last earnest comeback he teamed with Tenryu and Koki Kitahara to win his last title, the WAR 6-Man Tag Team Championship. Retirement Hamaguchi retired in 1995, after his team lost the title, to dedicate full-time to his dojo, today recognized as one of the premier independent wrestling schools in Japan. Famous pros trained by him include Satoshi Kojima, Shinjiro Otani, Shingo Takagi, Tetsuya Naito and Takao Omori. He also trains amateur wrestlers, including his own daughter Kyoko, who is one of the premier amateurs in Japan.

Some mines produce nickel primarily, while some mines produce nickel as a side- product of some other metal that has a higher concentration in the ore.  Geology  Most of the world's nickel reserves are in form of lateritic nickel ore deposits. Historically these were also the first source of commercially mined nickel sulphide ores, so that currently most of the nickel which has ever been produced came from nickel sulphide ores. Strong weathering of ultramafic rocks at the earth's surface in humid conditions causes nickel resources to form inside nickel laterites. Laterites are formed by the breakdown of minerals which then leach into groundwater, the leftover minerals join together to form the new mineral known as laterites. Nickel is turned into useable quality ore grade by being merged into the newly formed stable minerals.  Exploitation  About 40% of the world‚Äôs nickel comes from exploitation of nickel laterites. There are two hydrometallurgical methods to extract nickel and cobalt from nickel laterites, these processes are called sulphuric acid leaching and reduction roast-ammonia leaching. For high- magnesium silicates in lower profiles laterites the exploitation method used is smelting. Reserves and operations=Reserves production According to the intergovernmental International Nickel Study Group, the countries with the largest volume of nickel ore reserves are Australia (19.5 million metric tons), Brazil (10.5 million metric tons), Russia (7.5 metric tons), New Caledonia (6.5 million metric tons), Cuba (5.5 million metric tons), and the Philippines (just under 5 million metric tons).The World Nickel Factbook 2018, International Nickel Study Group (2019). As of 2017, 33 countries produced nickel ore. Nickel production increased from 2000 to 2013 (when it peaked), decreased from 2014 to 2016, and recovered from 2017 to 2018. Largest mines and operators As of 2017, the largest nickel mine operators are (in descending order of kilotonnes mined):Michael McCrae, Top nickel miners ranked, Mining.com (September 18, 2018). * Vale SA, which operates Sudbury Mine (Canada), Voisey's Bay Mine (Canada), Sorowako mine (Indonesia), VNC Goro mine (New Caledonia), Onca Puma mine (Brazil) and Thompson (Canada). * Norilsk Nickel, which operates Kola Division (Russia) and Nkomati mine (South Africa). * Glencore plc, which operates Integrated Nickel Operations (Canada), Murrin Murrin (Australia), and Koniambo mine (New Caledonia). * BHP Billiton, which operates Nickel West (Australia). BHP Billiton formerly owned Ravensthorpe Nickel Mine in the Shire of Ravensthorpe, Western Australia; the mine closed in January 2009. * Anglo American plc, which operates Barro Alto (Brazil) and Codemin (Brazil). * South32, which operates Cerro Matoso mine (Colombia). * Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. (SMM), which operates Sorowako (Indonesia) and Ambatovy mine (Madagascar). The company is a subsidiary of the keiretsu Sumitomo Group. * Western Areas, which operates Spotted Quoll mine (Australia) and Flying mine (Australia). * Lundin Mining, which operates Eagle Mine (United States). * Terrafame Ltd., which operates Talvivaara mine in Sotkamo (Finland). Other large nickel producers include Jinchuan Group Ltd., the largest nickel producer in China,China's Jinchuan to buy miner Tyler, The Wall Street Journal Asia (January 8, 2008). and Sherritt, a Canadian company from Canada that refines nickel from lateritic ores and has operations in Canada, Cuba, Indonesia and Madagascar. Usage According to the intergovernmental International Nickel Study Group, as of 2017, an estimated 75% of primary nickel usage went to stainless steel; 3.7% went to the battery industry; and the remainder went to other applications.  Hazards  A study was conducted by scientists Dan et al on the effects of Nickel smelting fumes, to do this they did the study on NIH/3T3 cells and in the lung tissue of rats. They found that the fumes that the NIH/3T3 cells were transforming into malignant cells meaning that high exposure to Ni-smelting fumes may be harmful as Ni-smelting fumes may be a potential carcinogen in mammalian cells. In the Philippines In the 2000s, a nickel boom began centered around Claver, Surigao del Norte in the Philippines; in 2017, the government of the Philippines (then the world's largest exporter of nickel ore) engaged in a crackdown against mine operators accused of violating environmental laws; the government closed the operations of 28 of the Philippine's 41 mining companies.Aurora Almendral, Philippines Moves to Shut Mines Accused of Polluting, New York Times (April 27, 2017). As of 2018, the Philippines was the world's second-largest producer of nickel ore in 2018, after Indonesia; both countries have extensively supplied China, the world's largest purchaser of nickel ore.Enrico Dela Cruz, Nickel mining indefinitely suspended in southern Philippines: official, Reuters (September 16, 2019). The two largest Philippine nickel companies are Nickel Asia Corp. and Global Ferronickel Holdings Inc.; both operate in the Surigao del Norte region.Enrico Dela Cruz, Philippine nickel miners to restart coronavirus- shuttered sites (April 28, 2020).  Nickel mine pollution  Nickel Rim mine in Sudbury, Ontario From 1953 to 1958 Nickel Rim mines operating around Sudbury, Ontario deposited their mine tailings in an impoundment near the mine. The water in the impoundment was later tested and found to have low pH and high concentrations of iron, sulphur and dissolved metals such as aluminum and nickel. This is due to the oxidation of the tailings (usually sulfide minerals like pyrrhotite). The limited oxygen diffusing into the layers causes the tailings oxidize for a longer period of time, for this reason the water at the impoundment is going to discharge water with high concentrations of iron and sulphate for at least the next 50 years. A study found that the Mount Keith Nickel Mine which is an open pit mine in Western Australia is sequestering and storing large amounts of carbon dioxide through enhanced weathering of mineral waste, this means that this mean is offsetting approximately 11% of the annual greenhouse gas emissions released by this mine.

Since the opening of the Wemmetsweiler curve in 2003, the line branches west to Lebach as the Prims Valley Railway (Primstalbahn) and east to Neunkirchen. History  Coal mines were developed in the Fischbach in the early 1870s. Collieries were started at Camphausen in 1871, at Brefeld in 1872 and at Maybach in 1873. During the planning phase some consideration was given to the transport of coal. Initially it was planned that the coal mines would be connected with branch lines to the Sulzbach valley. Since the proposal would have required a tunnel through a ridge, this plan was soon dropped. In addition, the line through the Sulzbach valley was already heavily congested. For this reason it was decided in 1866 to build a line from Neunkirchen to Saarbr√ºcken via the Fischbach valley. In 1873, a license was granted to build the line. Loading of coal at Camphausen mine started in February 1879. The line was opened via Brefeld and Wemmetsweiler to Neunkirchen on 15 October 1879. The branch line to the Maybach colliery was opened on 6 April 1881. When the G√∂ttelborn coal mine was sunk in 1887, a branch line was created from Merchweiler to the G√∂ttelborn colliery, which was opened on 1 October 1891. In 1965, the entire line was electrified. Following the closure of the G√∂ttelborn mine, the Merchweiler‚ÄìG√∂ttelborn branch line continues to be used to operate to the Weiher power station. Passenger services have, however, long been focused more on Lebach than on Neunkirchen, requiring passenger trains to reverse in Wemmetsweiler station. To avoid this, a connecting curve (the so-called Wemmetsweiler curve) was planned from the 1990s. In 2003, this curve was constructed, connecting to Illingen. Wemmetsweiler station was closed for passengers in 2006 and replaced by Wemmetsweiler Rathaus station, which is closer to central Wemmetsweiler. The bridge of state road L 128 over the line in Wemmetsweiler was replaced during urban redevelopment by a 54 metre long railway tunnel.

Life  Louis G√ºnther I was the son of Count Albrecht VII of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt and his wife Juliana of Nassau- Dillenburg. His brothers were Charles G√ºnther and Albert G√ºnther. After Albrecht VII's death, they divided Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt among themselves, and each ruled a part of the county. In 1598, Louis G√ºnther went to Jena to study at university, and then moved to Strasbourg, where he met with people in the highest circles. After a trip to Paris, he returned to Rudolstadt in 1604. On 10 April 1605, Albrecht VII died and on 24 June the brothers agreed that the eldest brother, Charles G√ºnther, would rule the county for the next six years. This allowed Louis G√ºnther to resume his journeys. In 1606, he returned to Strasbourg and then to Paris. In 1607, he visited Madrid, returned to Paris, then travelled to England and visited London, Oxford, Cambridge, and other places. On 10 February 1610, he finally returned to Rudolstadt. On 8 September 1612, the three brothers agreed to divided the County. Charles G√ºnther received a part which included the capital of Rudolstadt. Louis G√ºnther received a part including the town of Frankenhausen. The part of Albert G√ºnther included the towns of Stadtilm and Schwarzburg. In 1624 in Erfurt, Louis G√ºnther and Albert G√ºnther agreed to swap their possessions. So Louis moved to his new residence in Stadtilm in 1625 and Albert G√ºnther moved to Frankenhausen. Charles G√ºnther continued to reside in Rudolstadt until he died without an heir in 1630. On 24 November 1631, Louis G√ºnther and Albert G√ºnther agreed on a new division, in which Louis G√ºnther received Rudolstadt and Albert G√ºnther received Blankenburg. In 1634, Albert G√ºnther died without an heir, making Louis G√ºnther the sole ruler. On 5 September 1619, Louis G√ºnther's sister-in-law Anna Sophie of Anhalt (Charles G√ºnther's consort) founded the Virtuous Society, which was intended as a feminine counterpart to the Fruitbearing Society her brother Louis had founded. Louis G√ºnther I joined the Fruitbearing Society under the nickname (\\"he who gets stronger\\") and his wife joined the Virtuous Society. Louis G√ºnther I carried out reforms in education and, as usual at the time, made some large donations to the churches. He found the church library, and left his private book collection to this library in his will. He promoted musical life by founding his own court orchestra. It was first mentioned in 1635, and evolved into the Th√ºringer Symphoniker Saalfeld-Rudolstadt, which still exists. He died on 4 November 1646 in Rudolstadt. His widow ruled the county until 1667 as regent for their son Albert Anton, who was later elevated to Prince of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt.  Marriage and issue  On 4 November 1638, he married Emilie of Oldenburg- Delmenhorst.

Plot Aunt Mathilde \\"Ma\\" Hutchins (Maude Eburne) and the other ranchers of the valley are in danger of losing her ranches. Mr. Cavanaugh (Walter Fenner), an Eastern promoter, wants to develop a dude ranch on their land. In order to get their land, Cavanaugh arranges for the government to put up nearby public lands for auction‚Äîlands the ranchers use to graze their cattle. The auction would drive the ranchers out of business and allow Cavanaugh to acquire the land at a cheap price. Gene Autry (Gene Autry) and Ma's nephew Frog Millhouse (Smiley Burnette) come to the rescue. Gene organizes the ranchers to pool their funds and sell their herds in order to raise enough money to bid on the land at auction.

The song became an informal anthem of the Solidarity period in the People's Republic of Poland. From June 1976 protests against the Soviet-style communism imposed in Poland, all the way to the collapse of the Warsaw Pact in the 1990s, it was the symbol of the political opposition to the Communist regime. The song was widely popular among the members of Solidarity (NSZZ Solidarno≈õƒá), and won first-prize at the 1981 National Festival of Polish Song in Opole. It won the main prize at the 1981 National Festival of Polish Song in Opole. It is one of Pietrzak's best-known works. National Festival of Polish Song Background As Jan Pietrzak notes, he rarely wrote such serious pieces, but he was motivated to do so in 1976, after the workers' protests in the Ursus factory. \\"Prawda w ≈ºartach zawarta.\\" Interview with Jan Pietrzak by Patrycja Gruszy≈Ñska-Ruman. Biuletyn Instytutu Pamiƒôci Narodowej Nr 7 (90) lipiec 2008, , p. 16-17. Retrieved 14 June 2012. Music was composed by W≈Çodzimierz Korcz, while an unconfirmed anecdote suggests that the title- phrase was coined by Agnieszka Osiecka. Pietrzak performed the song at the stage of his own political Kabaret pod EgidƒÖ as an ending theme. When the censors forbade the Cabaret to do an encore of it, it became habitual that it was sung by the audience. It gained popularity in the following years, with people copying it on tape recorders, and ‚Äì during the emergence of Solidarity in 1980, it was often played from the workers radio stations and internal speakers. In June 1981 Pietrzak performed the song at the 19th National Festival of Polish Song in Opole, winning first-prize awards for the \\"hit song of the season\\" and \\"the audience choice.\\" The communist authorities tried to repress the song, which is one of the reasons why, despite numerous performances ‚Äì some gathering thousands of people on the streets, all chanting ‚Äì there are no recordings from that period. One of the largest public performances took place in Warsaw, at the crossroads of major streets (Aleje Jerozolimskie and Marsza≈Çkowska Street). For his support of the anti-communist opposition, Pietrzak was arrested in the aftermath of the introduction of the martial law in Poland in 1981. Cultural significance In spite of its mainly historical context, the song resonated with the millions of people in the communist Poland, particularly as a dream of freedom. It became one of the anthems of Solidarity. As J√≥zef Tischner noted: \\"The solemn words of the song tell of the everlasting and indomitable Polish spirit\\". Eventually however it lost popularity, due to critical voices among some of the Solidarity advisors that the references contained in it were \\"nationalistic, chauvinistic and backward\\". Nonetheless the song is still popular, and is often performed to a standing audience. The song inspired Ronald Reagan to name his own speech after it: Let Poland be Poland. He also presented Pietrzak with an engraved plaque bearing that title. The song was also quoted by Queen Elizabeth II during her speech in the Polish parliament.

Biography A native of the city of Hiroshima, Naito lost both of his parents at a young age, and was sent to be raised by his married elder sister living in Taiwan. He attended what later became the Taipei Municipal Jianguo High School, followed by Kagoshima University. He then travelled to the United States, where he attended Pennsylvania State University, majoring in horticulture. Proficient in Kodokan judo, Naito joined the university‚Äôs wrestling team, and soon became its captain, with the nickname of ‚ÄúTiger Naito‚Äù. However, this was a time of growing anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States, and for his own protection, Naito was asked to board with the rector of the university. With the passage of the Immigration Act of 1924, also known as the Asian Exclusion Act, it became impossible for Naito to represent the team in international competitions. The provost of Pennsylvania State University contacted the Japanese ambassador in Washington DC, and recommended Naito for inclusion into the Japanese team for the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, France. At the time, wrestling was largely neglected as a sport in Japan due to the popularity of Judo, and the inclusion of Naito into the Japanese team was made mostly for political reasons. Despite injuring his fingers in practice aboard the ship from the United States to France, Naito placed third in the freestyle wrestling competition, securing the bronze medal. It was also the only medal that the Japanese team won during the Olympics. Following this success, Naito decided to return to Japan, where he was invited to hold seminars on western-style wrestling at Waseda University. The sport also drew the attention of the Imperial Japanese Army, who asked Naito to teach instructors at the Toyama Military Academy, the training grounds for Japanese military intelligence and special forces. Naito‚Äôs alma mater, Kagoshima University, also established a wrestling club. However, the seeds planted by Naito did not bear immediate results, and after Japan was soundly defeated in the 1928 Summer Olympics, the sport was again eclipsed in popularity by judo. Naito, after living for a period in Taiwan, immigrated with his family to Brazil in 1928, where he became a successful businessman and chairman of Brazil‚Äôs Horticulture Associate. He is also credited with introducing the sports of judo and kendo to Brazil.

It is found in shallow temperate waters along the coasts of south east Asia and is commonly known as the Japanese spiky sea cucumber or the Japanese sea cucumber.  Description  The Japanese sea cucumber has a cylindrical leathery body with blunt, thorny protuberances. At the anterior or front end there is a mouth surrounded by a ring of short feeding tentacles and at the posterior end is the anus. There are three different colour morphs, red, green and black.  Distribution and habitat  The Japanese sea cucumber is found along the coast of Russia, China, Japan and Korea. The range extends from Alaska and Sakhalin Island to the Amami Islands, Japan. The red morphs are found on gravel beds offshore at depths of or deeper while the other two colours are found intermingled on muddy and sandy bottoms at shallower depths. Although the red morph may breed red offspring due to its reproductive isolation in a different microhabitat, DNA studies have shown that there is a limited degree of genetic difference between it and the other two colour morphs while there is no significant difference between the black and green forms. In lagoons in southern Sakhalin, Russia, Japanese spiky sea cucumber are found on solid substrates among growth of the red alga Ahnfeltia tobuchiensis and in oyster beds (Crassostrea gigas).  Biology  The Japanese sea cucumber sifts through the sediment on the seabed with its tentacles and feeds on detritus and other organic matter including plant and animal remains, bacteria, protozoa, diatoms and faeces. The sexes are separate in the Japanese sea cucumber. Males and females release a mass of gametes into the sea where fertilization takes place. In the laboratory, spawning from ripe gonads can be induced by varying the temperature at which the adults are kept or by use of the neuropeptide cubifrin. The planktonic larvae develop through several stages before settling on hard surfaces on the seabed, undergoing metamorphosis and becoming juveniles. The Japanese sea cucumber lives in temperate seas. In locations where the water heats up excessively in summer it undergoes aestivation, going into a state of dormancy. In this state, feeding stops, the gut degenerates, the metabolism slows down and weight is lost. The threshold temperature is about , higher for smaller individuals and for those from the southern part of the range where the ambient water temperature is higher. This sea cucumber has been known to continue in aestivation in some areas of China for four years.  Fishery and aquaculture  The Japanese sea cucumber is used for food. The largest fishery is in Japan where between 2000 and 2005, an average of 8,101 tonnes of this species were harvested annually. The red form is known there as \\"aka namako\\" and sells at a different price from \\"ao namako\\", the green morph and \\"kuro namako\\", the black one. In Russia and North Korea, overfishing has reduced populations considerably. Fishing methods include diving and hand collection at depths of up to and the use of trawls at greater depths. In the 1920s, a \\"sea cucumber fork\\" was developed in China. It is operated from several small vessels working together and allows harvest from depths of up to . The Japanese sea cucumber is also cultivated on a commercial scale in shallow ponds and by sea ranching in northern China, where production reached 5,865 tonnes in 2002. Rocks and tiles are placed on the bottom to provide settlement for larvae and protection from predators. Breeding programs are under way to improve growth rates and disease resistance and the genome is being sequenced. Hatchery techniques are being developed in Japan and China as are the preparation of suitable culture feeds and the investigation of the best methods of ranching. Albino forms and a thermally resistant strain that is less prone to aestivate are being developed in China.

He was a strong minded and combative individual, who was not afraid to clash with his superiors. Life Little is known of his early life, but a reference to his \\"great age\\" at death suggests that he was born in the early years of the fourteenth century. His name is believed to be an early form of Reeves, which later became common in Ireland. He was prebendary of Killaloe and then of Lismore. Bishop He became Bishop of Lismore in 1358. In 1363 Pope Urban V united the sees of Lismore and Waterford with le Reve as the first bishop of the united see.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol.1 p. 85 The union had been decreed as early as 1327 by Pope John XXII; it was to take effect on the death of whichever bishop passed first, but for reasons which are unclear it did not happen on the death of John Leynagh, le Reve's predecessor as Bishop of Lismore in 1354. It may well be that le Reve used his influence to ensure that he, not Roger Cradock, Bishop of Waterford, who should have succeeded to the united see on Leynagh's death, would be the first bishop. Although King Edward III ordered that the temporalities of the diocese be delivered to Cradock, this was not done; and four years later, when Cradock was translated to the see of Landaff, le Reve was confirmed as joint bishop without a formal election. He spent part of 1363 at the Papal Court in Avignon, where he sought a number of benefits for himself and the clergy of his dioceses, but few of them were granted.Bliss Calendar of Papal Registers Vol.1 1342-1419 pp. 438‚Äì9 Lord Chancellor He was briefly Lord Chancellor of Ireland in 1367‚Äì8. Few records of his tenure in the office survive, but he was accused of improper conduct in using the Great Seal of Ireland to retrospectively appoint his own candidates to certain offices, and this may have been the reason for his removal from office.Ball p. 85 A brief power struggle developed between Le Reve's friends at Court and those of his rival for the office, Thomas de Burley, Prior of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, who had the advantage of long experience in the office, having already been Lord Chancellor in 1359‚Äì64. Burley emerged as the victor in the struggle. Le Reve attended the Irish Parliament held at Kilkenny in 1367, which passed the celebrated Statutes of Kilkenny, an attempt to enforce a rigid legal and cultural separation between the Old Irish and the Anglo-Irish. Le Reve gave his full support to the Statutes.Gilbert, Sir John History of the Viceroys of Ireland Dublin 1865 pp. 224‚Äì7 He was also present at the Parliament of 1371, where he quarreled with both the Lord Treasurer of Ireland, Stephen de Valle (or Wall), Bishop of Limerick , and the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, William de Windsor. Relations with Windsor remained bad throughout the latter's tenure in office; it has been suggested that Windsor took his revenge in the Parliament of 1375, where Le Reve was assigned the notoriously unpopular task of collecting taxes. He remained a member of the Privy Council of Ireland and, despite his advancing age, he attended its meetings occasionally. Quarrel with Archbishop of Cashel Perhaps our best insight into le Reve's character comes from the glimpse we get of him in the written account of visitation of Philip de Torrington, Archbishop of Cashel in 1374. Le Reve emerges from this account as a formidable and quarrelsome individual, as indeed was Torrington. We have only Torrington's side of the story, which may not be entirely objective; but that le Reve could be quarrelsome is clear from his clashes with Windsor and Bishop de Valle. According to Torrington, le Reve resisted the visitation by armed force, and, although already an old man by medieval standards, he physically assaulted the Archbishop. He then looked on with approval as the Archdeacon of Cashel, who has accompanied Torrington, was attacked and seriously wounded by armed men in le Reve's retinue.Logan p. 50 Surprisingly little seems to have come of the episode. Torrington excommunicated le Reve, but this seemingly drastic step had no obvious effect on le Reve's career. In 1377 while in England Torrington attempted to persuade the Crown to take action against the bishop, but again nothing seems to have come of it,Logan p. 50 and when Torrington died in 1380 le Reve was still in possession of his see. Death He died at an advanced age in September 1394.

Digital Retribution gave the film three out of five stars, writing \\"On the surface Sanctimony appears to be a blatant American Psycho rip-off, although thankfully the final product manages to add enough subtle touches to separate itself from the novel by Easton Ellis and its subsequent film adaption. Director Uwe Boll has a great visual style, giving the dark Seattle streets a menacing look, while the cinematography of Mathias Neumann is quite impressive for what is obviously a low budget feature. The musical score from Uwe Spies was also quite impressive, adding some haunting touches to the slick visuals.\\" Reviewer M.J. Simpson awarded the film a B+ grade and wrote \\"It would be very easy (and lazy) to see this as a lower-budget spin on American Psycho, which came out around the same time, but the only similarity is that the killer is a yuppie, and we know his identity pretty much from the start. Sanctimony is a gripping detective thriller - a minor gem, exciting, scary and highly recommended.\\" Variety magazine gave a mixed review, stating \\"Sanctimony\\" is an iron-jawed, unashamedly generic serial-killer thriller let down only by dialogue that's as awkward as the pic's title. Classily lensed in widescreen and tighter than a rattler's tail, this should be a steady rental earner (and possible cult movie) in mature markets‚Äîwhere the cast of U.S. video regulars will strike chords among buffs‚Äîwith some theatrical business elsewhere. Plot springs some surprises both in its outlandishness and in not respecting casting conventions. Otherwise, it's purely formulaic, referencing any number of bigger-budgeted predecessors in look and content. Roberts, surprisingly good, and Van Dien handle the dialogue best, and Catherine Oxenburg, as Renart's wife, worst. Rubin, looking harder-faced than in her earlier career, makes a good partner to Pare's macho cop. Finale is weak, but otherwise Mathias Neumann's saturated, narrow-depth-of-field lensing is always atmospheric.\\" Movie- Vault.com gave the film three out of ten, writing \\"What an awful movie. Oh My Gawd! Are you a \\"Friends\\" fan? Then you could picture Chandler saying \\"Oh My Gawd\\" with that unique tone of voice he uses, and therefore you know the only three words that came to my mind after watching this film. The plot is simply a disaster. Eric Roberts plays the Detective's boss, but that doesn't help at all. The acting in this film sucks and all the characters are worse than boring. There are also some holes in the script, some questions are left unanswered and some scenes seem completely unnecessary. The story isn't even original, since it reminded me of other movies of this kind. And talk about endings, oh boy.. wait 'till you see this one! I would only recommend it to my worst enemies.\\" Richard Propes of The Independent Critic gave an unfavorable review, stating \\"Sanctimony passes, barely, for one simple reason. In spots, I chuckled. Were these intended chuckles from Boll? I have no doubt they were not. Yet, they were chuckles and gave me a few, very brief moments of light in the darkness that is this film. Sanctimony is typical Uwe Boll...uninspired, repetitive and wholly unoriginal.\\" BBC gave the film three out of five stars and wrote \\"Another serial killer hits the streets in this offbeat and slick little flick. Made with a bit more style than most, it looks very good in a fair DVD release. Heavily stylised visuals run through this movie, and they work well in a top-notch picture transfer.

It was introduced in 1984 at a list price of $5,000, ($7,000 fully expanded) and about 1100 units were produced. It combined MIDI sequencing and audio sampling (optional) with a set of 18 velocity and pressure sensitive performance pads, to produce an instrument optimized for use as a drum machine. It featured programmable hi- hat decay, 18 digital drum sounds, a mixer section, 18 individual 1/4\\" outputs, an LCD display, 6 external trigger inputs and an internal floppy disk drive (optional). The Linn 9000 had innovative and groundbreaking features and would influence many future drum machine designs. But chronic software bugs led to a reputation for unreliability and contributed to the eventual demise of Linn Electronics. The Linn 9000 would get a new lease on life when Forat Music and Electronics purchased Linn's remaining assets, fixed all of the bugs, added new features and dubbed it the Forat F9000. History The Linn 9000 was Roger Linn's first attempt to create an integrated sampling/sequencing/MIDI workstation, but was plagued with problems from the beginning. On early models, the power supply over-heated the CPU and had to be replaced under warranty, but insurmountable issues with the Linn 9000's operating system forced its eventual demise. The original Linn 9000 operating system had numerous bugs and it was common for the machine to lock-up and lose data. The OS was mostly written in an esoteric high-level programming language called FORTH with some machine language. In early versions, some of the FORTH code produced unacceptable delays in user interface functions and was rewritten in machine language. Linn attempted to debug, rewrite and enhance the operating system, but he was limited by the 64K code space memory segmentation in the Intel 8088 microprocessor that left no room for new features. Further software development was abandoned. The flawed Linn 9000 operating system was also used in the LinnSequencer, a rack mount 32 track hardware MIDI sequencer introduced by Linn Electronics in 1985. As a result, both machines earned a reputation for being notoriously unreliable. A planned rack mount successor to the Linn 9000, the LinnDrum Midistudio, which would have utilized the same operating system, was never released. These issues contributed to the eventual demise of Linn Electronics in 1986, but Linn drew heavily on the Linn 9000 and the Sequential Circuits Studio 440 when he designed the Akai MPC60, released in 1988. Forat Music and Electronics purchased the assets of Linn Electronics, recreating the Linn 9000 with a stable, bug-free operating system, releasing it as the Forat F9000 in 1987. Features The Linn 9000 has eighteen 8-bit 11 kHz ~ 37 kHz digitally sampled drum sounds: bass, snare, sidestick, hihat, two crash cymbals, two ride cymbals, four toms, cabasa, tambourine, high and low congas, cowbell and clap. The Linn 9000 had many firsts. In addition to being the first drum machine to incorporate a MIDI sequencer, it was the first drum machine with custom sounds, sampling capability (optional), a floppy disk drive (optional) and an LCD display. The programmable hi-hat decay is a unique feature that provides seven open hi-hat positions in addition to the closed hi-hat, allowing for subtle and expressive performances. The Linn 9000's most distinctive feature was 18 large (1.25 inch square) velocity- and pressure- sensitive rubber pads. Pad pressure is used for the Note Repeat feature. If holding Timing Correction and applying continuous pressure to a pad while in record mode, that note is automatically repeated at the Timing Correction note value setting. The velocity (volume) level of each repeated note is determined by the amount of pressure applied at the time the note is played. Similar rubber pads would be seen on many subsequent drum machines and controllers including the Akai MPC60 and the Akai MPC4000. Standard features * 32 track MIDI hardware sequencer * 18 digital sample drum sounds * 18 rubber velocity and pressure sensitive pads * Note repeat * Programmable 8 position hi-hat decay * A mixer section providing real-time control over volume, tuning, and pan * 18 on-board sliders and pan pots * 18 individual 1/4\\" outputs * Backlit LCD display screen * Online help * Cassette interface: mic- in, line-in, line-out * 6 external trigger inputs (expandable to 12) Optional features * 12 external trigger inputs (6 standard) * Internal 3.5\\" double density floppy disk drive * Digital sampling capability * Up to four custom sounds * SMPTE (never deployed by Linn) Brochure (1984)Architecture The Linn 9000 circuitry is deployed as a mother board with 14 slots.

Maurice Speed (1911‚Äì1998) was an English film critic who created two innovative and long-lasting publications: the listings magazine What's On in London (which ran from 1935 until 2007) and later the Film Review annual, which began in 1944 and in 2014 celebrated its 69th edition. Life and career Born in London on 18 October 1911, Frederick Maurice Speed began a lifelong devotion to filmgoing in the small cinemas around Hammersmith. According to a potted biography published in 1991, he began his working life as an apprentice on the Harrow Observer.Speed, F. Maurice Film Review 1991-92, Virgin Books 1991 What's On Having been an assistant to Edward Martell, proprietor of The Sunday Referee, it was to Martell that Speed turned when he had the idea to set up the listings magazine What's On in London. First published in September 1935,F. Maurice Speed, Film Review 1966-1968, W.H. Allen 1967 What's On was edited (and almost entirely written) by Speed, who titled his editorials 'Round and About'. According to Denis Gifford in his Speed obituary for The Independent, \\"During Coronation Year of 1937 Speed realised the vast appeal that George VI's coronation would have for visitors from abroad. 'Indispensable to Visitors' became the front-page subtitle from then on, replacing the original and less catchy 'Complete Arrangements for the London Week'.\\" Among Speed's earliest What's On pseudonyms were J. Lilywhite Haffner (for book reviews) and Frederick Deeps; he was still using the latter for shorter critiques in his Film Review annuals in the 1990s. He made his last contribution to the magazine in 1996, while What‚Äôs On itself outlived its creator by nine years, eventually folding in 2007. Film Review Speed's second innovative concept was based on his conviction that \\"What the ordinary moviegoer lacks is a more or less complete annual record, in picture and story, of his year's filmgoing. Ironically enough, it wasn't until the war came along, and I had been discharged from the Army, that I decided, as nobody else seemed so inclined, I might as well attempt to fill the void myself.\\"Speed, F. Maurice Film Review, Macdonald & Co 1944 The idea came to fruition in 1944 as Film Review. As Speed recalled in the annual's 50th edition, \\"That initial 1944-45 book sold some 80,000 copies to a book-starved public and the second annual reached a dizzy 250,000 print order.\\"Speed, F. Maurice Film Review 1994-95, Virgin Books 1994 The book rapidly developed into an annual illustrated digest of all the films screened in the UK. As time went on, Speed gathered together more and more outside contributors, among them Peter Noble, William K. Everson, Oswell Blakeston, Peter Cowie, Anthony Slide, Ivan Butler and Gordon Gow, as well as soliciting special articles by such film industry figures as James Mason, Michael Balcon, Cecil B. De Mille, Jean Kent, Rita Hayworth and Alfred Hitchcock. He also showed a keen interest in technical advances such as stereo sound and CinemaScope. In 1963, for the 20th edition, Speed's publishers, Macdonald & Co, altered the annual's format, reducing it in size and doubling the price. This new look only lasted for three years, after which Macdonald dropped the title. After a 12-month hiatus, Speed returned, now under the aegis of W.H. Allen, with a catch-up edition (published at the end of 1967) that covered a two-year period. In 1987 Speed, by then in his seventies, took on co-editor James Cameron-Wilson, who would eventually graduate to editing the book on his own before handing over to Michael Darvell and Mansel Stimpson in 2007. The annual was published in latter years by Columbus Books, Virgin Books, Reynolds & Hearn and, starting in 2011, Signum Books. Other work Speed's work was by no means confined to What's On and Film Review. His first book, Movie Cavalcade: The Story of the Cinema ‚Äì Its Stars, Studios and Producers, was published in 1943 and boasted a foreword by Bob Hope. Three years later he published The Londoner Annual as a spin-off from What's On, but this venture failed to initiate a series as Film Review had done. He edited The Western Film Annual from 1950 to 1956, then the retitled Western Film and TV Annual until 1962. With Cameron- Wilson, he also devised The Moviegoer‚Äôs Quiz Book in 1985. Recognition In March 1991 Speed was honoured by the London Film Critics' Circle. \\"I was considerably moved,\\" he wrote in that year‚Äôs Film Review annual, \\"when, at a little ceremony at the Ritz Hotel in London, my fellow critics saw fit to present me with a special award for long service to the film industry. That award, now facing me as I write this, is something I shall always treasure.\\" Twice married, F. Maurice Speed died in London on 29 August 1998. References ...

It is part of the OpenBSD Project, having been included in the operating system since OpenBSD 2.8 (December, 2000). Like other OpenBSD projects such as OpenSSH, it has been ported to other systems based on Berkeley Unix such as FreeBSD and NetBSD, and to Solaris and Linux. One of the Linux ports is supported by Intel for use with its proprietary cryptographic software and hardware to provide hardware-accelerated SSL encryption for the open source Apache HTTP Server. Background Cryptography is computationally intensive and is used in many different contexts. Software implementations often serve as a bottleneck to information flow or increase network latency. Specialist hardware such as cryptographic accelerators can mitigate the bottleneck problem by introducing parallelism. Certain kinds of hardware, hardware random number generators, can also produce randomness more reliably than a pseudo- random software algorithm by exploiting the entropy of natural events. Unlike graphics applications such as games and film processing where similar hardware accelerators are in common use and have strong operating system support, the use of hardware in cryptography has had relatively low uptake. By the late 1990s, there was a need for a uniform operating system layer to mediate between cryptographic hardware and application software that used it. The lack of this layer led to the production of applications that were hard-coded to work with one or a very small range of cryptographic accelerators. The OpenBSD Project, which has a history of integrating strong, carefully audited cryptography into its operating system's core, produced a framework for the provision of cryptographic hardware acceleration as an operating system service. /dev/crypto Application-level support is provided through the pseudo-device , which provides access to the hardware drivers through a standard ioctl interface. This simplifies the writing of applications and removes the need for the application programmer to understand the operational details of the actual hardware that will be used. Implications for other subsystems The OpenBSD implementation of IPsec, the packet-level encryption protocol, was altered so that packets can be decoded in batches, which improves throughput. One rationale for this is to maximize efficiency of hardware usage‚Äîlarger batches reduce the bus transmission overhead‚Äîbut in practice the IPsec developers have found that this strategy improves the efficiency even of software implementations. Many Intel firmware hubs on i386 motherboards provide a hardware random number generator, and where possible this facility is used to provide entropy in IPsec. Because OpenSSL uses the OCF, systems with hardware that supports the RSA, DH, or DSA cryptographic protocols will automatically use the hardware without any modification of the software. Backdoor allegations investigated : On 11 December 2010, a former government contractor named Gregory Perry sent an email to OpenBSD project leader Theo de Raadt alleging that the FBI had paid some OpenBSD ex- developers 10 years previously to compromise the security of the system, inserting \\"a number of backdoors and side channel key leaking mechanisms into the OCF\\". Theo de Raadt made the email public on 14 December by forwarding it to the openbsd-tech mailing list and suggested an audit of the IPsec codebase. De Raadt's response was skeptical of the report and he invited all developers to independently review the relevant code. In the weeks that followed, bugs were fixed but no evidence of backdoors was found.

Early life Ranard was the son of a foreign service diplomat, Donald L. Ranard, who, during and after government service, became active in human rights. John Ranard spent much of his childhood in Asian countries, among them Japan, Malaya, Korea, and Burma, and also Australia. After returning to the United States following these sojourns, Ranard attended the University of New Mexico, but his college life was interrupted when it was discovered he had Hodgkin's disease. Ranard overcame this, but it was during his treatment with blood transfusions that his doctors later believed he had contracted Hepatitis C, which dogged him for the rest of his life and finally killed him. While recovering from Hodgkin's, Ranard returned to his family home in Vienna, Virginia, and there, in the mid-1970s, he suffered a broken neck in a car accident and used the insurance settlement money to study at Louisville's Center for Photographic Studies. In the late 1970s, he was able to publish his work in two alternative Louisville news magazines, City Paper and Louisville Today, experimenting freely. He achieved a reputation during this time \\"as one of Louisville's most active and original photographers\\", publishing his work journalistically but also exhibiting in art venues such as Louisville's Portland Museum. Boxing portfolio It was during his Louisville period that Ranard began to photograph the inside world of amateur and professional boxing. His entry into professional boxing was empowered through a close association with the Louisville boxer Greg Page, who was managed by Don King in the early part of his career, and who was a heavyweight champion for five months in 1984‚Äì1985. In his boxing portfolio, entitled The Brutal Aesthetic, Ranard developed his work into a tightly-controlled, disciplined style of black-and-white photography. While Ranard photographed battles in the ring, the greater part of this portfolio is given over to capturing the background events of the sport which suggested its explosiveness. Marcy Werner, a curator at the University of Louisville Fine Print Collection, has written an MA dissertation on Ranard's work, and suggests that it was during this time that Ranard transformed from a documentary photographer into a social documentary photographer. She noticed, for instance, Ranard's critical depiction of the entourage of promoters and managers which surround fighters and make (or hope to make) a wealthy living from the fighters' sacrifices in the ring. She also noticed an occasional gentleness in the portfolio, citing the photograph \\"Purcell Davis (1979)\\", of a fighter disrobing at weigh-in, a jersey covering his head so that only the contour of his body showed, which recalled to her the contrapposto technique in Michelangelo's David. In \\"Round 1‚ÄîJerry McIntyre (vs. Greg Page) (1979)\\", a photograph of an unconscious fighter surrounded by handlers, she was reminded of Raphael's The Deposition. In 1985, Ranard read an essay by Joyce Carol Oates on boxing which appeared in the New York Times Magazine and approached Oates with the idea of a book collaboration. In his letter to her, Ranard expressed his aesthetics on documentary photography: > The photograph is a mystery, said by Winogrand best. \\"There is nothing more > mysterious as a fact clearly described.\\" The emotional impact of a well > taken picture is immediate yet the inherent ideas are at best alluded to, > specific in detail but always open to interpretation. The documentary > photograph deals more in myth than reality. The image that is important when > looking at a photograph is the second image, conjured up in the viewers > [sic] mind-memory. Only the documentary photograph has this power because > the photographic illustration is not believed. In a documentary photograph > we know it happened because the photograph proves it and we feel the pain. > This explains why Hollywood can't approach the horror of Viet Nam that the > news photographs taken in the streets and jungle suggest. Deer Hunter comes > close, but that movie always reminds me of the photograph of the South > Vietnamese colonel executing the Viet Cong suspect. Oates subsequently expanded on her essay and portions of The Brutal Aesthetic appeared aside her text in the book On Boxing, published in 1987 and now (2017) a Harper Perennial. In 1986, the year before the publication of On Boxing, Ranard's Brutal Aesthetic portfolio won a Kentucky Arts Council Al Smith Fellowship. Photographs from On Boxing appeared at an exhibition by the International Center for Photography in New York City of the \\"most notable photography books\\" of 1987, entitled \\"Midtown Review\\". Oates said of Ranard's photographs, \\"They're very poetic. They're the highest kind of journalism, where it passes into art. They're very unpretentious.\\" Russian work In the mid-1980s, Ranard moved to New York City's East Village and periodically photographed the street life of his neighborhood, squatter rights turmoil, and the Tompkins Square Park protests. In 1992, Ranard began to take numerous long trips to photograph the disintegration of the Russian Empire. A portion of his Russian portfolio focused on drug users and the HIV/AIDS problem in Russia. In 1998, in the 55th Annual Pictures of the Year Competition, he won first place for an Issue Reporting Picture Story from the National Press Association and the Missouri School of Journalism for his photo essay on drug use in Russia, \\"Inside a High Risk Community\\". The photos had appeared earlier in The New York Times Week in Review, accompanying an article by Michael Specter. Later, Ranard received financial contracts from the Soros Open Society Institute to continue his work on AIDS in Russia. He also received support from M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (Holland) and AIDS Foundation East-West (AFEW). The latter used his photographs in media campaigns in Russia and Eastern Europe to warn of the dangers of drugs and also to help the institution raise funds. M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res and AFEW together published two of Ranard's books on Russia, The Fire Within (2001) and Full Life (2001).The Fire Within is about drug abuse and Full Life is a general documentary on life in Russia. The books add up to about 100 pages and contain some 54 photographs. During Ranard's explorations in Russia, he gained an inside look at Russian prisons, for both males and females, and juveniles. Ranard's prison photos overlap with his work on HIV/AIDS in Russia, but it also comprises a separate portfolio entitled The Prisoners which he drafted into a mock-up book. Commentary on HIV/AIDS photographs One unusual aspect of Ranard's Russian work on HIV/AIDS is the depth of appreciation it evoked in scholars who were involved in the AIDS field. Ranard's work did not exploit the fiendish aspects of drug users, as has been common among the voyeuristic photography of this genre. HIV/AIDS scholars have remarked of the \\"stoicism\\" with which Ranard photographed drug users in Russia, with elements of compassion, maintaining their dignity and representing them as human. Yet Ranard did not view the AIDS problem through rosy lenses; rather, the dry horror of the problem is more commonly intimated through capturing the isolation and alienation of drug users, and those who might be in prison because of it. Return to Louisville In the early years after 2000, Ranard began to find that his battle with Hepatitis C was taking its toll. Receiving treatment, he could not travel abroad as he had before, and he decided to return to Louisville to photograph the store-front churches of the black community and the struggles of the churches with the problem of black violence among teenagers. This portfolio was also put into mock-up form for publication and is titled On Every Corner. Death As Ranard's health declined, he contracted liver cancer and began to photograph himself in the terminal tangent of his last months. Some of these photographs are shockingly candid, while others are more oblique but resonate with foreboding. One of the more powerful, \\"Self-Portrait with Female Nursing Assistant\\" (2007), was exhibited at a memorial, mini-retrospective show at the Hite Art Institute's Cressman Center for Visual Arts in Louisville in 2009 and appears in the hard- copy edition of Kathleen Keish's review of the exhibition in Louisville Eccentric Observer. Many of Ranard's photographs of himself in terminal illness, or which imply illness, were taken with small cameras held by hand at a distance or while he was receiving treatment at hospitals, in the manner of \\"selfies\\" with an iPhone camera, or with the help of image reflection in mirrors. In other cases, photographs such as \\"Self-Portrait with Female Nursing Assistant\\" were set up with tripods and timers. These photographs constitute his last portfolio. In late 2007, he received a liver transplant but it was unsuccessful and on May 14, 2008, he died. At the time of his death, Ranard was in possession of four mock-up books of his life's work which he was attempting to publish in a media form that might be widely disseminated: The Brutal Aesthetic (which had never been published in entirety), Lost Heroes (about life in Russia during the fall of the Empire), The Prisoners (about Russian prisons), and On Every Corner (about race relations between blacks and whites in Louisville and the city's African- American store-front churches). Several of these books contain short essays by Ranard and biographical information about his history. Legacy Ranard generally shot in black-and-white with a wry eye to exposing the falsities and injustices he encountered. The Cressman Center said of its memorial show of Ranard's work in 2009, it is \\"most impressive in its breadth, consistency, and emotive impact\\" and that his photographs 'transcend journalism and become an exquisite representation and expression of shared humanity.\\" AFEW's obituary read: > John was in many ways the backbone of the start-up of harm reduction in > Russia. His social photographic work is pure art; but it also showed us the > harsh reality and illustrated in a brilliant and compassionate way the > urgent need to respond. In my mind, he is a worthy candidate for the > Rolleston Award, even if he were to receive it posthumously.\\" Awards *1984: Kentucky Humanities Council, The Photograph as Document. *1985: Al Smith Fellowship from Kentucky Arts Council for The Brutal Aesthetic. *1998: First Place, Issue Reporting Story, 55th Annual Pictures of the Year, Pictures of the Year International.

The mall opened in November 2011. History Completed in late 1983 as Katong People's Complex, it had an exterior facade resembling a prison cell, such as having exposed blue pipes. It was a strata titled mall back then, comprising a department store and various shops and eateries. There are also numerous medical clinics inside the mall. In 1995, the facade was revamped and the mall was renamed Katong Mall. The department store was replaced by Cold Storage supermarket, and various education centres occupied the upper floors of the mall. The mall's basements contained an electronics store and various strata titled units. In 2009, because of bad business, Pua Seck Guan, former chief executive of CapitaLand Retail, bought Katong Mall in a $247.55 million deal as part of an en bloc sale. A private trust called Perennial Katong Retail Trust was subsequently formed to buy the mall from Tuan Sing Holdings' Golden Cape Investment. The trust's investors included corporate and institutional investors and Pua. The mall closed its doors in mid 2010 for a major makeover, to help revitalize the mall. When it reopened as 112 Katong in late 2011, it featured a Peranakan theme, as a reminder of its location. The mall also featured a cinema, a food court, a gourmet supermarket, banks and more than 150 specialty shops. It also featured a wet and dry playground on the fourth floor. In early 2016, Keppel Land acquired a 22.4% stake in the mall from the owners at $51.4 million. In May 2016, plans were announced to redevelop the play deck on the fourth floor into an alfresco dining area. There are plans for a non-profit organisation to take up space in the mall too. In December 2018, Keppel Land acquired the remaining 77.6% stake of the mall from the subsidiary of Alpha Asia Macro Trends Fund at the price of $56.6m. The mall is closed in March 2020 for extensive revitalization works and is slated to reopen in 2021, in order to \\"capture the charm and character of Katong\\" ReferencesExternal links * 2011 establishments in Singapore Shopping malls in Singapore Shopping malls established in 2011 ","title":"I12 Katong"},{"id":"36098000","title":"Madly Bangalee"},{"id":"36098003","title":"Grade I listed churches in Merseyside"},{"id":"36098005","text":"Estonian Swedish () () are the eastern varieties of Swedish that were spoken in the formerly Swedish-populated areas of Estonia (locally known as Aiboland) on the islands of Orms√∂ (Vormsi), √ñsel (Saaremaa), Dag√∂ (Hiiumaa) and Run√∂ (Ruhnu), and the peninsula (former island) of Nuck√∂ (Noarootsi), by the local Estonian Swedes.

Life Thomas Hamilton, Lord Binning was the eldest son of Thomas Hamilton, 1st Earl of Haddington and his second wife, Margaret Foulis of Colinton. Until his accession to his father's Earldom, he was known by the courtesy title Lord Binning. Following education abroad Binning returned to Scotland where he attended Parliament in 1621.Balfour Paul, vol iv, pp 315-316 Binning attended his father at the funeral of King James in London, and later was a canopy bearer during Charles I's 1633 coronation in Edinburgh at Holyrood Abbey. Binning succeeded to his father's titles in 1637, and the following year, at the King's urging, signed the National Covenant. At the start of the Bishops' War, Haddington was commissioned Major General for the Lothians, under General Leslie. When General Leslie advanced into England in 1640, he left armaments behind at Duns, Haddington retrieved them back to his headquarters at Dunglass Castle, to prevent their capture by the English garrison at Berwick upon Tweed. On 29 August, he beat back an attempt of the garrison of Berwick to capture a magazine of victuals and arms near Coldstream. On 30 August 1640, a huge explosion took place in the powder magazine of the castle, destroying it. Haddington, who was standing in the courtyard reading correspondence from Leslie to his kinsfolk and men, was killed. Others killed were Haddington's brother, Robert Hamilton of Wester Binning; his natural brother, Patrick Hamilton; his cousins John Hamilton of Redhouse and Alexander Hamilton of Innerwick; Alexander's son, Haddington's brother-in-law, Colonel Sir John Erskine; and the Minister of Bonkyl Kirk, Master John Gaittis.Balfour Paul, vol iv, pp315-316 Marriage and Issue Haddington married Lady Catherine Erskine (d.1635), daughter of John Erskine, Earl of Mar and Lady Mary Stuart, herself a daughter of Esm√© Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox, and by her had issue: *Thomas Hamilton, 3rd Earl of Haddington *John Hamilton, 4th Earl of Haddington *Hon.

Champion was one of three in the class built by J. Elder & Co., Govan, Scotland and was launched on 1 July 1878.Bastock, p.107. She was the third vessel under this name in the Royal Navy. Design and construction Champion was a single-screw corvette (later classified as a third-class cruiser) designed for distant cruising service for the British Empire. The intention of the Royal Navy was to use the class as scout vessel for the fleet, but due to their slow speed, the class was mainly used for protection across the globe. Built with iron frames and steel plating, Champion was sheathed with two layers of teak wood and sheathed with copper. The hull was unprotected except for a 1.5 in (38 mm) of armour over the machinery spaces. with some additional protection offered by the coal bunkers flanking the engine spaces and magazines.Osbon, pp. 195‚Äì98 They marked a dramatic step forward in basic habitability, with improved below-decks ventilation, a sick bay, bathroom for ratings and even a ship‚Äôs library.Chesneau, Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1860‚Äì1905, p. 52-53.

Laid down on 17 August 1876 as yard number 207, Champion was launched on 1 July 1878 and commissioned on 7 December 1880. Career Champion was fitted for sea at Sheerness. She visited Amoy, China in April 1886 and was based in the Pacific from 1890 with the China Station. In August 1891 under command of Captain Frederick St Clair, Champion cooperated in a joint landing by French, American and German warships at Valparaiso, Chile, to protect civilians and their respective consulates during the 1891 Chilean Civil War. The officers of the international parties placed themselves in front of the muzzles of some machine guns with which the president-elect had threatened the civilian populace. During 1892, Champion made a survey and map to Johnston Atoll, hoping that it might be suitable as a cable station. On January 16, 1893, the Hawaiian Legation at London reported a diplomatic conference over this temporary occupation of the island. In 1893, under command of Captain Rookes, Champion visited Pitcairn Island, during which time Captain Rookes prepared a criminal code and reorganized the government of the colony. Champion was present at the Naval Review at Spithead in celebration of the Diamond Jubilee on 26 June 1897. From 1904, she was placed in harbour duty as a training vessel, and became a stokers training ship in Chatham. She was renamed Champion (old) when the new was built in 1915. During the First World War she was moored in the middle of the Thames between Cliffe Fort and Coalhouse Fort, where she was used by the River Examination Service to control river traffic. On 23 June 1919, her hulk was sold to Hughes Bolckow, Blyth for scrapping.

It contains purplish or greenish spikelets. This plant grows in plains and desert grassland, shrubsteppe, and desert shrubland habitat. It may occur in desert wetland habitat types such as desert marshes, seasonal lakes, and floodplains. In this kind of habitat it is an important species for preventing erosion and slowing runoff by trapping sediments. It may be a common to prominent or dominant species. It dominates some grasslands in its native range, alongside other common grasses. This type of grassland has been reduced to a fraction of its pristine range by forces such as overgrazing and the channelization of water.

She won The Oaks against other fillies in June and in September added St. Leger Stakes, beating the double Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Alleged. She raced without winning in 1978 before she was retired to stud. Background Dunfermline, a \\"rangy\\" bay filly with a white star, was bred by her owner Queen Elizabeth II. She was sired by the 1967 Derby winner Royal Palace who had previously had a disappointing record at stud. Her dam, Strathcona won one race and was sold by the Queen in 1976, the year before Dunfermline's greatest success: she was a half-sister to the Eclipse winner Canisbay. Dunfermline was sent into training with Major Dick Hern at West Ilsley in Berkshire. She was ridden in all of her races by Hern's stable jockeys: Joe Mercer as a two-year- old and Willie Carson thereafter. Racing career=1976: two-year-old season Dunfermline ran three times as a two-year-old in 1976. She failed to win but was placed in all of her starts. She finished second to Triple First in the May Hill Stakes at Doncaster and second again behind Miss Pinkie in the Argos Star Fillies Mile at Ascot. 1977: three-year-old season On her three-year-old debut, Dunfermline was sent to Newmarket in April to contest the Pretty Polly Stakes. She recorded her first win by beating Olwyn by four lengths in the ten furlong race. The form of Dunfermline's victory was boosted when Olwyn won the Irish 1000 Guineas in May. In the Oaks, Dunfermline started at odds of 6/1 in a field of thirteen fillies. Her task was made easier when Durtal the Cheveley Park Stakes winner was withdrawn after sustaining an injury when going to the start. Dunfermline stayed on strongly in the closing stages to win by three quarters of a length from Freeze The Secret. Dunfermline reappeared in August in the Yorkshire Oaks. She appeared to be unsuited by the slow pace and finished third behind the Peter Walwyn trained filly Busaca. In the St Leger at Doncaster, Dunfermline started at odds of 10/1 in a field of thirteen, with the Irish-trained colt Alleged being made odds-on favourite. Hern also entered a colt called Gregarious who acted as a pacemaker and led until half a mile from the finish. Alleged, ridden by Lester Piggott, took the lead but was soon challenged by Carson on Dunfermline. The colt and the filly pulled clear of the field in the final quarter mile with Dunfermline getting the better of a prolonged struggle to beat Alleged by one and half lengths. In the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp in October, Dunfermline finished fourth behind Alleged. Later that month, she finished third behind Rex Magna and Trillion in the Prix Royal-Oak. 1978: four-year- old season Dunfermline stayed in training as a four-year-old but failed to win in three starts. Her best performance came when she finished second to Montcontour in the Hardwicke Stakes at Royal Ascot Assessment Timeform gave Dunfermline a rating of 133 in 1977, making her the top-rated three-year- old filly in Europe. The rating was the third highest given to a three-year- old filly up to that time behind Coronation (135 in 1949) and Petite Etoile (134 in 1959). In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Dunfermline a \\"great\\" Oaks winner and the eleventh best filly trained in Britain and Ireland in the 20th century. Stud career Dunfermline was retired to stud, but made no impact as a broodmare. She died in 1989.

Hla (U Tun Hla, ) (1874‚Äì1946) was an early pioneer watercolor and oil painter of Burma who painted in the Western style. M.T. Hla was the signature he used for signing his paintings, which was apparently derived from the initials in the name Maung Tun Hla. Childhood years M.T. Hla was born in a village by the name of Gyaung Wyne in the Tuntay township and received a monastic education. It is said that the monastery where he schooled was decorated in traditional Burmese floral arabesque and with imagery of mythical creatures and that M.T. Hla spent his time copying these designs in drawings. Of his own accord, he learned traditional one-line drawing, a singular technique of Burmese depiction in which imagery is often completed with long floral lines or even, from beginning to end, with one stroke of a drawing or painting implement. When he left the monastery, he became a painter, and like other artists such as Saya Chone (1866‚Äì1977) and Saya Aye (1872‚Äì1930), who had acquired skills in Traditional Burmese painting, he began to decorate pavilions at festivals, religious events, and funerals of monks. M.T. Hla's early background in Traditional painting is significant for although he embraced Western-style painting with much enthusiasm, remnants of Traditional depiction remained in his work, especially in his portraits. Ad hoc training from British artists In the early 1900s, M.T. Hla encountered the British artist Sir Gerald Kelly (1879‚Äì1972), who came to Burma to paint its scenes and who later established his reputation in England largely through his landscapes of Burma and portraits of Burmese dancers and ladies. Gerald Kelly subsequently became a painter of note in Britain, becoming Official State Portrait Artist of the King and Queen during World War II and holding the office of President of the Royal Academy of Arts from the 1949 to 1954. According to the art scholar Min Naing, M.T. Hla received training of some kind from Gerald Kelly while Kelly was in Burma. M.T. Hla almost certainly knew of the works of Robert Talbot Kelly (1861‚Äì1934), who had traveled to Burma a few years before Gerald Kelly and who published the book Burma Painted and Described with over 70 reproductions of his watercolors. The occasional watercolor by M.T, Hla has emerged which appears to have been inspired by images in Talbot Kelly's book, a point to be expected as Talbot Kelly's book was widely disseminated in Burma and became a kind of manual of watercolor style for early Burmese painters attempting to learn Western painting. Two other early Burmese artists in the Western style, for example, Ba Ohn (c.1877-fl. 1924) and Maung Maung Gyi (1890‚Äì1942) learned painting by copying images from Talbot Kelly's book. With such ad hoc skills, M.T. Hla rose in Burma to become one of the foremost painters in the Western-style in Burma during the 1910s and 1920s, with his paintings decorating Rangoon's best hotels and his postcard paintings selling there. In Rangoon, his works sold readily at the Smart and Mookerdum bookstore, earning him a high income. According to Nyan Shein, his paintings were also reproduced in art publications in Britain. That M.T. Hla's work sold well to British customers is born out by the fact that a large number of his paintings have appeared in the hands of dealers and auctioneers in England over the past 20 years. Influence of Ba Nyan M.T. Hla did not study at the Burma Art Club, where a generation of later painters in the Western style, such as Ba Zaw (1891‚Äì1942) and Ba Nyan (1897‚Äì1945), received more formal instruction by British colonials in Burma who had backgrounds in painting. And when Ba Nyan and Ba Zaw traveled to London to study at the Royal College of Art and returned to Burma in 1930, M.T. Hla's reputation was eclipsed by theirs. Although both Ba Nyan and Ba Zaw studied at the Royal College of Art (Ba Nyan for only a short time), their experience in London (and in Ba Nyan's case, Europe) were quite different. Ba Zaw became a severe standard-bearer of transparent watercolor painting of what may be called the British Watercolor School style, while Ba Nyan learned oil painting and gouache. When the two painters returned to Burma, a split developed in the Burmese art world; the transparent watercolor painters followed Ba Zaw, and the painters who were learning gouache or oil painting fell into Ba Nyan's camp. Despite a difference of a generation of age between M.T. Hla and Ba Nyan, M.T. Hla studied gouache technique from Ba Nyan (and probably oil painting as well); thus, in some watercolors done by M.T. Hla, those most likely done after 1930, opaque white sometimes appears. Most of M.T. Hla's landscapes are standard riverbank and boat scenes, often including the de rigueur image of a bright-red flamboyant tree. These works, in transparent watercolor, might easily be taken as works by a painter with professional British training. They do not hint much of M.T. Hla's early background in Traditional Burmese arts, acquired when he was young and at monastery. M.T. Hla‚Äôs portraits M.T. Hla's portraits are a different matter. He is recorded by the art writers G. Hla Maung and Nyan Shein as possessing strong skills in portraiture, to the degree that he could depict faces accurately and realistically, from memory, after 30 minutes or so of exposure to his subjects. While this may be true of faces, most of M.T. Hla's full body portraits reveal awkwardness of anatomical proportion, with figures appearing exaggeratedly short or squat, or standing stiffly as if posing self- consciously for a snapshot. It is possible that M.T. Hla's early background in Traditional Burmese painting, which is pictorially stiff in terms of its depictions, particularly of the Buddha or human figures, influenced these portraits. It is also possible, however, that he was attempting, just as painters such as Saya Aye and Saya Myit (1888‚Äì1966) (his student) did, to mix elements of Traditional Burmese painting with the Western style to create original effects. The ambiguity regarding M.T. Hla's aesthetic aims in his watercolor portraits which bear Traditional elements is complicated by the fact that a fluid and stunning, emotive Western-style watercolor portrait by M.T. Hla appears in Burmese Painting: A Linear and Lateral History, but this painting has proved to be a rare case where M.T. Hla copied from a photograph. Nonetheless, M.T. Hla did produce some original masterpieces of Western-style portraiture. One is a group portrait in oil at the National Museum of Myanmar entitled Ladies from the Hilly Region. The painting is a startling work of realism in many respects, not least of which for its intriguing subject matter. It is a portrait of a bare-breasted group of females in the hills of Burma, amid large baskets of fruits and vegetables, wearing odd cusps over their noses. The ethnic identity of these figures is unknown and has never been identified. His legacy M.T. Hla's many portraits of ethnic figures was a first for an artist in Burma. One might consider the tradition in Burmese painting out of which he emerged. In Traditional Burmese painting, the focus of works of art up to his time had been religious (i.e., Buddhist) tales or monarchial events and subjects. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the ‚Äúfamily portrait‚Äù works of royal or wealthy families by Saya Chone and the portraits of high officials by Saya Aye appeared. But there was very little history of depicting the common person in works of painting, let alone members of distant ethnic groups, somewhat alien to the Burmese. M.T. Hla broke a path for Burmese artists into a new genre of exploration‚Äîthe many minority groups of the nation. M.T. Hla's portraits may be said to possess a priceless slice of Burmese anthropological history. Very few, if any, of M.T. Hla's oil works have surfaced abroad. Nyan Shein mentions a handful of oil paintings which he refers to as M.T. Hla's ‚Äúmasterpieces‚Äù but the location of most of these works is unknown. In the decade after 2000, the occasional undocumented oil painting appeared in Burma in the hands of art dealers. In addition to watercolor and oil painting, M.T.Hla was considered a master of glass painting, an art form which he evidently passed on to his student Saya Myit. None of M.T. Hla's works on glass have been found in Burma in recent years, however. His death During World War II, M.T. Hla lost his wife and two sons. Despite a healthy income during his productive years, M.T. Hla died in poverty in 1946.

studio album, Love? (2011). It was written by Evan Bogart and J√∂rgen Elofsson, with its producer Troy \\"Radio\\" Johnson. The song is a soft rock song that speaks of a love that never dies. Music critics made note of \\"Until It Beats No More\\" being an ode to Lopez's then-husband Marc Anthony. The song received universal acclaim from music critics, who cited it as a stand-out track on Love?. Upon the release of Love?, the song debuted at number nine on the South Korea Gaon International Chart. \\"Until It Beats No More\\" has been performed live on numerous occasions, most notably at an anniversary concert for the Mohegan Sun casino in Uncasville, Connecticut, where Lopez broke down in tears after the performance. The song was used as background music during Lopez's \\"My World\\" commercial for the Fiat 500. The commercial depicts Lopez leaving Manhattan and making her way to hometown of The Bronx, New York. Controversy arose when it was revealed that Lopez had not filmed the commercial in The Bronx, but instead filmed the close-up shots in Los Angeles, while a body double was used for the driving scenes in The Bronx.  Music and lyrics  \\"Until It Beats No More\\" is a soft rock song, with a length of three minutes and fifty-two seconds (3:22). It was written by Evan Bogart, J√∂rgen Elofsson and Troy \\"Radio\\" Johnson, with the latter also producing and audio engineering the track. Kuk Harrell recorded, engineered and edited Lopez's vocals for the song at Pulse Recording in Los Angeles, California, with additional editing from Chris \\"Tek\\" O'Ryan. The song was later mixed by Trevor Muzzy. \\"Until It Beats No More\\" speaks of a love that never dies. According to Lopez, it is about when you are at a bad bad point in your life and somebody comes in and makes you believe in love again. She cited her then-husband Marc Anthony as being that person for her. Monica Herrera of Billboard picked up on this, with the lyrics: \\"I feel the beat again, stronger than before\\". Scott Shetler of PopCrush pointed out the song's optimistic viewpoint, with the lyrics: \\"I'm alive, I can breathe, I can feel, I believe.\\" The song received a positive review from Monica Herrera of Billboard, who called the song \\"honest and adult\\". Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone cited \\"Until It Beats No More\\" as being one of two stand-outs songs on Love?; the other being \\"On the Floor\\". Shane Phoenix of Hot Spots gave a positive review of the song, stating that the lyrics are \\"spot on\\" and the \\"winds are fabo, the keys and key breaks in this one really allow her vocal sense to come out and shine\\". He concluded by stating that: \\"If you have been looking for a new love song, this could be your pick\\".  Live performances  Lopez debuted \\"Until It Beats No More\\" live on February 27, 2010, during her hosting gig on Saturday Night Live. Lopez introduced the song as \\"Pieces\\". She performed the song on October 22, 2011 at an anniversary concert for the Mohegan Sun casino in Uncasville, Connecticut. Lopez introduced the song by saying: \\"I'm going to sing you the last song I wrote about love... a lot has changed since then.\\" Following the performance of the song, Lopez began crying. \\"Until It Beats No More\\" was used as an introduction to Lopez's performance at the American Music Awards on November 20, 2011. She wore a golden gown, with the words: \\"Love... It's a journey and I still have questions\\" appearing in a screen behind her. Lopez began to break down, appearing as though she was about to cry. She then paused, looked up and shed most of her clothes for a performance of \\"Papi\\". Critics noted the \\"fake breakdown\\" to be poking fun at her breakdown during her performance of the song at the Mohegan Sun casino a month earlier. The performance was compared to Britney Spears's music video for \\"Toxic\\" and Lopez's performance during the 2001 American Music Awards. \\"Until It Beats No More\\" was included on the set list of Lopez's debut concert tour, the Dance Again World Tour, in 2012. Reviewing her concert in Dubai, Natalie Long of Tabloid! said that although a large portion of her performance was uptempo, \\"When she did take a seat to sing, giving her full voice to songs like 'Until It Beats No More', she proved she was the perfect American Idol judge ‚Äì she‚Äôs got great pipes. What can‚Äôt this woman do?\\"  Usage in media  \\"Until It Beats No More\\" was used as background music during Lopez's commercial for the Fiat 500 \\"Until It Beats No More\\" is featured as background music in Lopez's commercial for the Fiat 500. The commercial, entitled \\"My World\\", depicts Lopez leaving Manhattan and making her way to The Bronx, her hometown. Lopez is seen behind the steering wheel of the car, gazing out at the scenery of The Bronx passing by. A voice-over says the words: \\"Here, this is my world. This place inspires me to be tougher, to stay sharper, to think faster. They may be just streets to you but to me, they're a playground.\\" Controversy arose for the commercial when it was reported that Lopez did not return to The Bronx to shoot the commercial. Instead, Lopez filmed her close-up shots in Los Angeles, while a body double was used for the car scenes through The Bronx. Fiat and Lopez were slammed for false advertising Lopez's return to The Bronx. Fiat released a statement stating: \\"Both commercials featuring Jennifer Lopez were indeed filmed in the Bronx as well as outside locations. As you may know, in today's world, people are increasingly mobile and their work takes them to a variety of locations. As a result, we took the opportunity to film wherever Ms. Lopez was working at the time to accommodate her schedule. The commercial tells the story of how the simple elements of our upbringing can help explain who we are, where we're going and serve as a source of inspiration to achieve our goals in life. One does not need to be in a specific location to be inspired or continue to be inspired.\\"  Credits and personnel  Credits adapted from the liner notes of Love?. *Jennifer Lopez - lead vocals *Jim Annunziato ‚Äì vocal engineer *Evan Bogart ‚Äì songwriter *J√∂rgen Elofsson ‚Äì songwriter *Shani Gonzales ‚Äì additional A&R; *Josh Gudwin ‚Äì vocal engineer *Kuk Harrell ‚Äì vocal producer, vocal engineer, vocal editor *Troy \\"Radio\\" Johnson ‚Äì songwriter, producer, audio engineer *Trevor Muzzy ‚Äì mixing engineer *Chris \\"Tek\\" O'Ryan ‚Äì vocal editor  Charts  { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" - !

It was founded around 1110, although its interior dates chiefly from the late 18th century. The church was designated a Grade I listed building on 23 February 1954. It is situated on the town's east cliff, overlooking the mouth of the River Esk overlooking the town, close to the ruins of Whitby Abbey. Church Steps, a flight of 199 steps lead up the hill to the church from the streets below. The church graveyard is used as a setting in Bram Stoker's novel, Dracula. Architecture Caedmon's cross on the west side of the churchyard A Norman church was built on the site around 1110 and added to and altered over the centuries. The tower and transepts are from the 12th and 13th centuries. The tower is square and crenellated, as are the walls. One of the oldest parts of the church is the quire which has three round-headed windows at its east end. Its side walls originally had three bays with similar windows but have been altered. It has three aumbries, one with a small piscina. The nave has five bays and is contemporary with the quire, its south wall is much altered but three external buttresses remain. When the church was enlarged in 1818 most of the north wall was removed and replaced by columns to accommodate an aisle, four large square-headed windows were inserted on the south side, the south porch was built in 1823 and a north porch built in the new annexe. The ceilings over the nave are boarded with several skylights. The transept was built in the 13th century and has three altered lancet windows in its northern arm while its southern arm is considerably changed and its windows all replaced. A squint cuts through from the south transept to the quire. The three-stage west tower has a squat appearance, its corners supported by flat buttresses and its embattled parapet is a 16th-century addition. Of its ring of eight bells, six are inscribed, \\"Whitby 1762 Lester and Pack of London fecit\\" and two were added in 1897. Interior Memorial to Peregrine Lascelles (1685-1772) The nave and transept have 19th-century galleries accessed by internal and external staircases and a three-decker pulpit which was installed in 1778 and altered in 1847. It retains its 18th-century box pews, some of which are inscribed, \\"For Strangers Only\\", and north of the chancel arch is a Jacobean pew. There is a monument to Sir Richard Cholmley who died in 1631. The church includes a memorial to Lieutenant-General Peregrine Lascelles (1685-1772), who served in a number of 18th century wars, including the Battle of Prestonpans in 1745. Threat from cliff erosion Two significant land slips due to broken drainage and torrential rain, the first occurring in November 2012, have placed the churchyard, and properties below the cliff, in significant jeopardy. Whitby town councillor Steve Smith stated the church was in no danger, having been built on solid rock. Human remains have fallen onto the street below, and pathways on the cliff-side of the church have been closed. Popular culture Bram Stoker used St Mary's Church graveyard as the setting for a scene in his novel, Dracula: > For a moment or two I could see nothing, as the shadow of a cloud obscured > St. Mary's Church. Then as the cloud passed I could see the ruins of the > Abbey coming into view; and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp > as a sword-cut moved along, the church and churchyard became gradually > visible... It seemed to me as though something dark stood behind the seat > where the white figure shone, and bent over it. What it was, whether man or > beast, I could not tell.

In January 2013, the Internal Revenue Service announced that it was suspending the program because of a ruling on January 18, 2013, by Judge James E. Boasberg of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. As a result of a lawsuit, the Court issued an order prohibiting the Internal Revenue Service from enforcing the regulatory requirements for registered tax return preparers. In accordance with this order, tax return preparers covered by this program are not currently required to register with the IRS. The IRS announced that because of the Court's ruling, tax return preparers are not required to complete the competency testing or to secure the continuing education that had been required.IRS Announcement, Jan. 22, 2013, at .

History of Registered Tax Return Preparers  The IRS in 2010 announced it would increase standards for return preparers as well as institute testing and continuing education requirements.https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=217781,00.html RS Proposes New Registration, Testing and Continuing Education Requirements Prior to the IRS Return Preparer Initiative, anyone could call himself or herself a tax return preparer regardless of age, experience or training. The IRS conducted a series of public hearings with tax preparers, associations and consumer advocates and the result was the Return Preparer Review. The initiative required all tax return preparers to register with the IRS and obtain a Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN). It required certain preparers to pass a competency test and complete 15 hours of continuing education credits annually. Exempt from the testing and CE requirements were Certified Public Accountants, attorneys and Enrolled Agents because they already have testing and education requirements for their credentials. Also exempt were non-1040 tax return preparers and non-signing preparers who are supervised by CPAs, attorneys or Enrolled Agents and work at firms 80 percent owned by CPAs, attorneys and Enrolled Agents. Tax preparation volunteers were exempt from all initiative provisions.  Registered Tax Return Preparer requirements  In order to become a Registered Tax Return Preparer, a person was required to be age 18 or older, to register with the IRS, and to have a valid Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN). A Registered Tax Return Preparer was to have passed a competency test covering tax law issues, individual tax return preparation and ethics. He or she was required to pass a tax compliance check conducted by the IRS. To maintain the designation, a Registered Tax Return Preparer was required to complete 15 hours of continuing education courses each year and renew his or her PTIN annually. Finally, the Registered Tax Return Preparer was required to adhere to ethical standards set out by the Department of Treasury's Circular 230.https://www.irs.gov/taxpros/article/0,,id=254929,00.html Become a Registered Tax Return Preparer The first certificates for Registered Tax Return Preparers were issued in March 2012.https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=255400,00.html IRS Sends Test Results; First Registered Tax Return Preparer Certificates Exemptions from the Tax Return Preparer Requirements For certain professionals such as those already enrolled to practice before the IRS, CPAs, and tax attorneys, the scope of the exemption from the testing and annual continuing education requirements was clear. For others who did not possess a designation, the facts and circumstances determined whether or not the practitioner was required to become a Registered Tax Return Preparer.http://fastforwardacademy.com/index-page-irs-paid-return-preparer- changes.htm Exempt Classes of Preparers This exemption did not eliminate the need for all tax return preparers to obtain a PTIN (preparer tax identification number). To qualify as a non-Form 1040 series preparer, a tax return preparer could not receive compensation for the preparation or assistance with, any Form 1040 series tax return or claim for refund, except a Form 1040-PR or Form 1040-SS. A non-Form 1040 series tax return preparer was allowed to sign any other tax return he or she prepared. A non-1040 series preparer was required to obtain a PTIN (preparer tax identification number) from the IRS, and to certify annually upon renewal that he or she did not prepare Form 1040 series tax returns. An important characteristic of a supervised preparer was that the individual could not sign, or be required to sign, tax returns as a paid return preparer. At least 80 percent of the firm that employs the supervised preparer was required to be owned by attorneys, CPAs, or enrolled agents. A supervised preparer was required to be supervised by an attorney, CPA, enrolled agent, enrolled retirement plan agent, or enrolled actuary who signs the returns prepared by the supervised preparer. Non-Form 1040 Series Preparers and Supervised Preparers were exempt from IRS competency testing and continuing education requirements. Non-1040 series preparers and supervised preparers were not allowed to identify themselves as a Registered Tax Return Preparer or as a Circular 230 practitioner.  Registered Tax Return Preparer Test  Prior the program's suspension, the Registered Tax Return Preparer Test was used as a minimum competency exam intended for return preparers to demonstrate basic proficiency in U.S. tax law, tax return preparation and ethics. It was a 120-question exam timed at 2.5 hours. Preparers who were required to pass the test had until December 31, 2013.https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/rtrpcandidateinfobulletin.pdf Candidate Information Bulletin  Continuing Education  Prior to the suspension of the program in January 2013, Registered Tax Return Preparers and RTRP candidates were required to complete 15 hours of continuing education annually. They were required to have 10 hours of general federal tax law, 3 hours of tax law updates and 2 hours of ethics. These continuing education courses were required to be taken from IRS-approved continuing education providers. Preparers who had a RTRP test requirement also had a continuing education requirement, even if they had not yet taken the test.https://www.irs.gov/taxpros/article/0,,id=255485,00.html FAQs: Registered Tax Return Preparer Continuing Education Requirements  Ethics and Tax Compliance  Under the program, ethical requirements that previously applied only to CPAs, attorneys and Enrolled Agents also applied to all paid return preparers. All tax professionals also were to undergo a tax compliance check and were subject to the standards for practice outlined in Treasury Department Circular 230.https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=257999,00.html IRS Marks Third Anniversary of Return Preparer Review  Services provided  Registered Tax Return Preparers were allowed to prepare and sign federal tax returns for individuals. They had limited authority to represent taxpayers before the Internal Revenue Service. RTRPs were allowed to represent clients before revenue agents, customer service representatives, or similar officers and employees of the IRS (including the Taxpayer Advocate Service) during an audit if they signed the tax return or claim for refund for the tax period under examination.https://www.irs.gov/taxpros/article/0,,id=239685,00.html Frequently Asked Questions: Preparer Credentials By comparison, CPAs, attorneys and Enrolled Agents have unlimited representation rights before the IRS. They may represent taxpayers at any stage of an audit, collection or appeals process. Suspension of the program In January 2013, the IRS issued the following announcement: ::As of Friday, Jan. 18, 2013, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia has enjoined the Internal Revenue Service from enforcing the regulatory requirements for registered tax return preparers. In accordance with this order, tax return preparers covered by this program are not currently required to register with the IRS, to complete competency testing or secure continuing education. The ruling does not affect the regulatory practice requirements for CPAs, attorneys, enrolled agents, enrolled retirement plan agents or enrolled actuaries. ::The Internal Revenue Service, working with the Department of Justice, continues to have confidence in the scope of its authority to administer this program. On Wednesday, Jan. 24, the IRS and Justice Department asked for the injunction to be lifted.

Early life  Pervez Malik was nine years old when Pakistan became independent in 1947. His family had a background in military service, but he was influenced by his class fellow, Waheed Murad, whose father, Nisar Murad, ran a film distribution business, namely Film Arts. With the passage of time, both learned the art of making and marketing films from Nisar Murad and his colleagues, mostly film-industry personalities. After graduation, both decided to study film-making in the US, but Waheed Murad was his parents' only child, he wouldn't be allowed to go away to US for four years. So Pervez Malik went alone while Waheed Murad was admitted to Karachi University to pursue his second highest passion, English Literature. Pervez Malik received his master's degree in film-making from University of Southern California at Los Angeles and returned to Pakistan in 1963.  Film career  After returning, he joined country's most widely circulated English language magazine 'Eastern Film' as assistant editor. During this period, Waheed Murad had already produced his own two films under the banner of his father's Films Art.

Moody came from a notable family of boxers, six of his brothers fought professionally, with the most successful being British and Empire middleweight boxing champion Frank Moody. Glen Moody was Wales middleweight champion, winning the title in 1930 and successfully defended it on four occasions. Moody later moved up to light Middleweight and won the Wales title at that weight too. Personal history=Boxing career Moody was born in Pontypridd, Wales in 1909. Moody was one of seven boxing brothers, the most notable of whom were Frank and Jack. Moody started boxing at the age of 14, and his first recorded professional bout was at the age of 16 when he met Jack Morgan at the Pillgwenlly Labour Hall in Newport on 9 January 1928. The fight went the full ten rounds and the referee decided the match was a draw. Just a month later Moody was fighting in the National Sporting Club in London, a points decision win over Jack Butler from Chesterfield. By the end of the year he was travelling to Liverpool to fight at The Stadium. In 1939 Moody was appearing as far as Scotland, and fought the Scottish Middleweight champion, Steve McCall in Edinburgh. Although he lost via technical knockout in the tenth to McCall, Moody was impressing enough in his home country to garner a shot at the Wales middleweight title. A challenge was arranged against the title holder, Jerry Daley, who had won the belt just three months prior. The two met at Judges Hall in Trealaw on 15 February 1930, for a 15-round contest. The bout went the distance, and the referee awarded Daley the decision. Towards the end of 1930 Moody faced Gunnar Andersson, the Swedish Welterweight champion, in London. The points decision went to Moody, but when the two met for a rematch Gothenburg less than a month later, Moody lost in round seven. In March 1931 Moody was given a rematch for Daley's Welsh title. Again the fight went the full fifteen rounds, but this time, in front of his home crowd, Moody was awarded the decision and the Welsh Middleweight title. He was the subject of This Is Your Life in March 1962 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews in the foyer of London‚Äôs Caf√© Royal. Military career With the outbreak of the Second World War, Moody enlisted in the Royal Engineers and was mobilised to France. After the Fall of France, Moody was one of the soldiers evacuated at Dunkirk. On 14 March 1941, while stationed at Clydebank in Scotland, Moody was involved in the rescue of a civilian in a recently bombed building for which he received the British Empire Medal.

Incumbent Republican mayor Charles H. Kline was re-elected over Thomas A. Dunn, who ran on the Democratic and Good Government party tickets. Until this election, no mayor of Pittsburgh had won consecutive terms since Henry A. Weaver in 1858, owing in part to a prior long-standing law prohibiting a mayor from succeeding himself. As of 2017, this is the last time a Republican was elected mayor of Pittsburgh. Primary elections Prior to the Great Depression, Republicans dominated city politics. In this party's primary, Kline won a plurality of votes over Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas Judge Richard W. Martin and City Council President James F. Malone. Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce president and future city police chief Dunn, although a registered Republican, entered the race as a Democrat and won that party's primary. Dunn also ran on a \\"Good Government\\" ticket, hoping to attract support from independents as well as disgruntled Republicans upset over corruption in the Kline government. General election Dunn failed to pull in enough independents to compensate for the anemic Democratic vote as Kline won easily, taking 28 of 30 wards. Dunn received 29,838 votes on the Democratic ticket and 8,454 votes on the Good Government slate.

He has served as both a starter and a reliever. Listed at and , Kelly throws and bats right-handed. The St. Louis Cardinals drafted Kelly in the third round of the 2009 MLB draft. He pitched for the Cardinals and the Boston Red Sox before joining the Dodgers in 2019. Kelly has gained publicity for his comical repertoire, such as dancing in the outfield during practice, disguising himself while interviewing the unwitting rapper Nelly, and engaging in a lengthy staredown with Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Scott Van Slyke before a 2013 National League Championship Series game. Early life and amateur career Kelly was born in Anaheim, California, and attended Corona High School in Corona, California. After high school, he attended the University of California, Riverside (UCR), and played college baseball for the Highlanders team. An outfielder in high school, he converted to pitcher in college and served as the closer. He was named Big West Conference Pitcher of the Year in 2007 as a freshman. After his sophomore season in 2008, he played collegiate summer baseball for the Yarmouth‚ÄìDennis Red Sox of the Cape Cod Baseball League. In 2009, Kelly posted a 5.65 earned run average (ERA) with a 1‚Äì1 win-loss record. Kelly set a Highlanders record with 24 career saves and was named an All-American. His final career stats at UCR included a 4.65 ERA and an 8‚Äì11 record in 42 career games. Professional career The St. Louis Cardinals drafted Kelly in the third round of the 2009 MLB draft and signed him on June 15 for $341,000. Minor leagues (2009‚Äì2012) Kelly's first professional team was the Batavia Muckdogs of the Class A Short Season New York‚ÄìPenn League, where he appeared in 16 games (two starts), posting a 4.75 ERA with 30 strikeouts in innings. In 2010, the Cardinals mainly used Kelly as a starting pitcher with the Class A Quad Cities River Bandits to get him more innings and develop his secondary pitches. He succeeded in the role and remained a starter. For the season, Kelly appeared in 26 games (18 starts) and pitched innings while registering 92 strikeouts and 45 walks with a 4.62 ERA and 6‚Äì8 record. In 2011, Kelly pitched for the Class A-Advanced Palm Beach Cardinals of the Florida State League and then the Double-A Springfield Cardinals of the Texas League. Combined, Kelly appeared in 23 games (22 starts) and pitched 132 innings, recording 113 strikeouts and 59 walks with an 11‚Äì6 record and 3.68 ERA. In 2012, with the Triple-A Memphis Redbirds, he posted a 2.86 ERA in 12 games (all starts) and earned a call-up to the major league club. St. Louis Cardinals (2012‚Äì2014)2012= St. Louis Cardinals in 2012 Kelly made his MLB debut on June 10, replacing the injured Jaime Garc√≠a in the Cardinals' starting rotation. Kelly pitched seven innings in his MLB debut, against the Cleveland Indians, allowing seven hits and one run while striking out four batters; he received a no decision in the game. Once Garc√≠a returned to the rotation, Kelly moved to a bullpen role; however, he impressed team officials so much they considered keeping him in the rotation and moving Lance Lynn to the bullpen. Overall for the 2012 Cardinals, Kelly appeared in 24 games (16 starts) while compiling a 5‚Äì7 record, with a 3.53 ERA and 75 strikeouts in 107 innings pitched. ;First MLB hit Kelly acquired his first major league hit and run batted in (RBI) on June 25, 2012, against the Miami Marlins. In an extra-innings game played at Marlins Park, the Cardinals had taken a 7‚Äì6 lead in the top of the tenth inning and had the bases loaded with two out, when the pitcher's spot in the batting order was due to hit. As Cardinals manager Mike Matheny had no position players available to pinch hit, Matheny chose a speedy former college outfielder to bat, rookie pitcher Joe Kelly. Kelly beat a ground ball for an infield hit that scored a run‚Äîhis first major league hit and RBI‚Äîand put the Cardinals up 8‚Äì6. This run proved to be crucial, as Miami scored a run in the bottom of the tenth, before reliever Jason Motte closed it out for an 8‚Äì7 Cardinals win. ;2012 Postseason Kelly's first MLB postseason series was the 2012 National League Division Series, against the Washington Nationals. He appeared in three games and pitched innings of relief without giving up a run or a hit; he walked one batter and struck out three batters. The Cardinals then advanced to the 2012 NLCS against the San Francisco Giants. In the deciding Game 7, Kelly came on to pitch in the third inning with the Giants ahead 2‚Äì0 with the bases loaded and no outs; he gave up two hits and two walks, lasting just of an inning, and exited with the Giants ahead 7‚Äì0, in a game they would go on to win 9‚Äì0. Overall, Kelly made four appearances in the series, pitching a total of four innings in relief; he gave up six hits and was charged with two earned runs, while walking three batters and striking out two batters. =2013= After spring training in 2013, Kelly lost his rotation spot to rookie Shelby Miller and was relegated to the bullpen for much of the first half of the season, seeing little use. However, he became known somewhat as a \\"stopper\\" after being reinserted into the rotation to increase its effectiveness. In August, Kelly went 5‚Äì0 with a 2.08 ERA. He stranded 83.3% of baserunners as a reliever, and 82% as a starter. He won all three of his starts against the Pittsburgh Pirates, who finished the season three games behind the Cardinals. During the 2013 Cardinals regular season, Kelly had 37 appearances (15 starts), registering a 10‚Äì5 record and 2.69 ERA, with 79 strikeouts in 124 innings pitched. Against the Milwaukee Brewers on September 22, Kelly showcased some of his speed he utilized as a former center fielder when Brewer Carlos G√≥mez was caught in a rundown between third base and home plate. G√≥mez, a speedy center fielder himself with 37 stolen bases at the time, was attempting to run back to third base when Kelly took the throw and sprinted after him. Kelly caught up with G√≥mez, dove, and tagged him out just steps away from the bag. ;2013 Postseason On October 6, Kelly made his first postseason start against the Pirates in the 2013 National League Division Series, receiving a no decision in Game 3. He had the same result in Game 1 of the NLCS, followed by a loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 5. In Game 6, Kelly and Dodgers outfielder Scott Van Slyke created a stir before the first pitch by engaging in a lengthy staredown. Both men remained on the field after the conclusion of \\"The Star-Spangled Banner,\\" long after the rest of their teammates departed the field to await the start of the game. They maintained their positions with hats over their chests through the ground crew's preparation of the field and starting pitcher Michael Wacha's warmup pitches. A total of about 15 minutes passed before the annoyed home plate umpire, Greg Gibson, motioned to both players. Both claimed \\"victory\\", as Kelly had smiled first, and Van Slyke had first moved from his position. The Dodgers celebrated in their dugout. This event induced noticeable laughter from teammates, curiosity from announcers calling the game, and mirth on Twitter. Van Slyke said he had \\"never done that. I stayed out there after the anthem was over and noticed Kelly was out there, too, and I figured I would stay longer than him. Then I caught his eye and he had this big smile, like he was telling me he could stay longer than I could, and before you know it, it was just the two of us.\\" Kelly added, \\"After every national anthem, I usually stand there and wait for the other team to leave. It's something that I like doing, and I guess I feel like I get a little grin out of that. But I guess [Van Slyke] caught onto it, and he just started standing there.\\" The Cardinals won the game behind Wacha's strong performance, and thus the series. Kelly made his first World Series start in Game 3, against the Boston Red Sox. He received a no decision in a 5‚Äì4 Cardinals win, pitching innings while allowing two hits and two runs, striking out six batters and walking three batters. The Cardinals lost the series in six games. =2014= Kelly won his 2014 debut on April 5 after the Cardinals defeated the Pirates, 6‚Äì1, despite allowing 10 base runners in innings. He also doubled off opposing starter Francisco Liriano for his first hit of the season. He spent most of the first half on the disabled list, but rehabbed in Triple-A Memphis and was activated to face the Milwaukee Brewers on July 11. He gave up six earned runs in his return, but got a no decision when Matt Holliday, Jhonny Peralta, Kolten Wong, and Matt Adams all homered to give the Cardinals a comeback win. His next start, on July 19 against the Dodgers, was a dominant seven-inning performance that tied his longest career outing. During the 2014 season, Kelly appeared in seven games (all starts) for the Cardinals, pitching 35 innings and compiling a 2‚Äì2 record with 4.37 ERA prior to his trade to Boston at the end of July. Overall, in parts of three seasons with St. Louis, Kelly compiled a 17‚Äì14 record with 3.25 ERA and 179 strikeouts over 266 innings pitched in 68 games (38 starts). Boston Red Sox (2014‚Äì2018) On July 31, 2014, Kelly was traded to the Boston Red Sox along with first baseman/outfielder Allen Craig for starting pitcher John Lackey and minor league pitcher Corey Littrell. =2014= In ten starts for Boston, during August and September, Kelly went 4‚Äì2 with a 4.11 ERA while striking out 41 and allowing 32 walks in innings. =2015= In January 2015, Kelly made a guarantee to the Boston media that he would win the AL Cy Young Award the following season. He began the 2015 season on the disabled list. Through his first 15 starts, he suffered through his worst season in the majors, going 2‚Äì6 with a 5.74 ERA. He had led all major league pitchers with four errors through July 27. However, in an August resurgence, he won all six starts, including a 3‚Äì1 win over the New York Mets on August 29, making him the first Red Sox pitcher since Pedro Mart√≠nez to record six wins in one month. He lowered his ERA to 4.94 in August. Kelly was shut down after September 15 due to injury. He finished the season 10‚Äì6 in 25 starts for the season with a 4.82 ERA. =2016= Boston Red Sox in 2016 Early in the 2016 season, the Red Sox placed Kelly on the disabled list on April 20 with a right shoulder impingement. In his return on May 21, he took a no-hitter through innings against the Cleveland Indians until Juan Uribe broke it up with a double; Boston won, 9‚Äì1. However, Kelly pitched only and innings in his next two starts. By the end of the 2016 season, after spending time with the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox, Kelly's role with Boston was as a relief pitcher. He ended the 2016 regular season with 20 MLB appearances (six starts) with an ERA of 5.18 and a record of 4‚Äì0. In his new relief role, Kelly made three appearances in the 2016 American League Division Series. He pitched a total of innings, retiring all 11 batters he faced including three strikeouts, as the Red Sox were swept by the Cleveland Indians. =2017= For the 2017 season, Kelly continued his role as a member of the Red Sox bullpen.

Later, he studied in Paris under Fran√ßois Flameng (1856‚Äì1923), both at the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts and at Flameng‚Äôs studio, opened in 1905, where Henri Sollier was a fellow student.  Exhibitions at the Salons  In 1914 Vogt participated in his first Salon des Artistes Fran√ßais, becoming a member in 1922. After an absence of six years Vogt then took part in the Salon des Artistes Fran√ßais again in 1920 and 1922. His last submission, in 1924, was the Fauvist landscape, a composition that demonstrates the distance he had travelled since his first 1914 Salon. From then on, Vogt would submit work to the Parisian Salons more regularly. In 1926, at the Salon des Tuileries, he exhibited Femmes au bord de la mer, introducing ‚Äì just this once ‚Äì the life-size human figure into the landscape. Later in his career, the human figure would appear again, if only allusively, in the many views of Paris that he quickly sketched out in paint on small wood panels. It was in this format alone that he focused on bourgeois life, depicted in the emblematic setting of the capital‚Äôs monuments and public parks.  Landscapes in Alsace and the C√©vennes  Vogt periodically returned to Alsace, where he maintained a pied-√†-terre in Mulhouse. From there he would roam the countryside, painting directly from nature the landscapes of his youth, the banks of the Ill, for instance, and the Vosges forest bordering Soultz. His early landscapes bring to mind those of another Alsatian artist, Jean-Jacques Henner, who showed his work at the Salon until 1903. This painter was himself very much attached to his native region, and renewed his inspiration through his contact with the rugged nature of Alsace. The artist was especially aware of the seasons and climate. Thus he would often return to the same place, as he did in Anduze, a traditional C√©vennes village, to paint the site in winter and summer. His favourite seasons are clearly autumn and spring, when nature displays her fieriest colours. Vogt excels in the shifts from brown to russet, for example in his treatment of Alsace‚Äôs forests and in the intense greens that deck out the foliage of the poplars along the Bords du Loing (INV 2535), in the Seine-et-Marne. It was there that Vogt spent his final years as a painter. The study of the reflections of trees in water, one of his favourite motifs, inevitably recalls Impressionist precedents, such as Alfred Sisley, who remained faithful to Moret-sur-Loing and its peaceful, verdant countryside until his dying day. In the 1940s, Vogt took the paintings of Pierre Bonnard for his models, specifically those of the 1920s, which were painted on the French Riviera (fig. 8) and in Canet. From these Vogt borrowed the broad, loose brushstrokes that lend his landscapes of the C√©vennes and Alpes-Maritimes their particular vibrancy.  Maturity  Between 1930 and 1940, Vogt developed an individual genre, the animated landscape, with works like La cour de ferme (fig. 9), or Les maisons Alsaciennes (INV 2022), a preliminary study of which is extant (fig. 10). Such paintings, exhibited both in the Paris Salons and the exhibitions of Mulhouse‚Äôs Soci√©t√© des Arts, stand out thanks to his polychromatic palette. The uniform light, creating the paintings‚Äô peaceful atmosphere, is consistent with contemporary painting, with its paring down of detail and simplification of form. In 1957 the Raymond Duncan Gallery in Paris mounted a retrospective of this painter ‚Äòof luminous landscapes‚Äô, to use the words of the famous Alsatian illustrator and cartoonist Henri Zislin.

This cracker is quite different from other types of traditional Asian crackers such as the Indonesian krupuk and the Japanese senbei or beika; while most of traditional crackers' ingredients are ground into a fine paste, rengginang retains the shapes of its rice grains. It is similar to Japanese arare, and yet it differs because arare are individually separated larger rice pellets, while rengginang rice granules are stuck together in a flat-rounded shape. Rengginang traditionally made from dried leftover rice. In Suriname it is known as brong-brong. Rengginang can be plain, or flavoured sweet, salty or savoury. The most common rengginang are deep fried with added pinches of salt for a traditional salty taste. Sweet rengginang uses thick liquified coconut sugar coated or poured upon it. Other variants have other ingredients added to enrich the taste, such as dried prawn, terasi (shrimp paste), or lorjuk (razor clam).  Similar cracker  In Central Java, especially in Wonogiri Regency, there is an almost identical rice cracker called intip made from scorched rice, the hardened semi-burnt rice that sticks to the inner bottom of rice-cooking vessels. These cooking vessels are filled with water to loosened up the stuck rice. After it is separated from the cooking vessel, the stuck rice is sun-dried until it loses all of its liquid contents. The dried sticky rice is later deep fried in a lot of cooking oil to create a crispy rice cracker. There is no significant difference between rengginang and intip other than its size; because intip is created from the inner bottom of cooking vessel, its size is larger than rengginang.

In 1987, the band released their debut album, the eponymously titled Blind Idiot God, to great acclaim in the underground musical community. Their second album and third album were produced by composer Bill Laswell and titled Undertow and Cyclotron respectively. After Ted Epstein left the band in 1996 and Gabriel Katz followed in 2012, Andy became the only original member still performing in Blind Idiot God. In 2014, he founded the Brooklyn-based label Indivisible Music, with the intention of \\"promot[ing] that which cannot be divided, the elemental idea of music for its own sake.\\" Blind Idiot God released Before Ever After on February 24, 2015, marking the band's first album of new studio material in thirteen years. Azonic In 1994, Hawkins released Halo, a solo album recorded with Bill Laswell and bandmate Gabriel Katz. Comprising four lengthy drone pieces, the album marked a departure from his recordings with Blind Idiot God. It was well-received from a critical standpoint, with The Wire crediting it as an understated masterpiece of post-metal. Two Azonic tracks also appeared on Subsonic 3: Skinner's Black Laboratories, a split with guitarist Justin Broadrick of Godflesh. Brian Olewnick of allmusic described Hawkins' work as a \\"fuzz-strewn maelstrom that would send most metal guitarists loping home, tail between legs.\\" Azonic, now performing as a duo of Andy Hawkins and Tim Wyskida, will play its first show in decades on April 14 at Saint Vitus Bar in Brooklyn. A second album is set to be released by Indivisible Music on October 20, 2017. The music was recorded at Martin Bisi's BC Studios with producer Bill Laswell overseeing the final mix. Musical style  With an ability to traverse multiple genres and styles and utilize distortion and drone music, Andy Hawkins' technique has been described as being forceful yet precise. Hawkins has noted the importance of equipment and the role space plays in his sound, saying, \\"I can't play through a small amp for an entire recording. I've got to have that big-amp impact along with the ambience of the room. There's a lot of complexity in a distorted guitar tone, and it needs some room to breathe.\\" The Wire described him as \\"a master of oceanic reverb and sustain, turning riffs from concrete slabs to gentle, body-caressing ripples.\\" Hawkins has cited modern classical composers such Gy√∂rgy Ligeti, Krzysztof Penderecki and especially Igor Stravinsky as an influence, crediting The Firebird with kindling his passion for music at an early age. Personal life On March 20, 2016, Hawkins married Rachel Meuler in New Orleans. They divorced in 2018.

Today only two short sections remain, which are used as industrial spurs. The AER can be traced to a charter in 1888 under the provincial government as the Manitoulin & North Shore Railway (M&NS;) which intended to connect Manitoulin Island with the mainland. The charter was held by a syndicate headed by Robert A. Lyon, however, no construction took place throughout the 1890s. The charter was acquired in 1899 by Francis Clerque of Sault Ste. Marie. The M&NS; was re-chartered under the federal government in 1900 to connect Sudbury with Little Current on Manitoulin Island. From there the line was to run to the southern end of Manitoulin Island and via a railcar ferry to Tobermory and on to Meaford, Wiarton and Owen Sound. In October 1913 the line reached Little Current on Manitoulin Island with the opening of the Little Current Swing Bridge; it would never extend further to the southern end of the island, nor the ferry service to the Bruce Peninsula and connection to Owen Sound. On May 19, 1911, while it was still under construction to Little Current, Clerque had the M&NS; renamed to the Algoma Eastern Railway in order to maintain naming similarity with the other Lake Superior Corporation subsidiary companies. Traffic sources The line had a traffic base focused on forestry products from the abundant forests on the north shore of Lake Huron such as pulp and paper and milled lumber, as well as the metal mining and smelting industries of the Sudbury Basin. Major traffic sources included the Canadian Copper Company's smelter at Clarabelle and a Canadian Copper Co. mine at Creighton. The Lake Superior Corporation had a nickel mine at Elsie and a nickel mine and smelter at Gertrude. The Spanish River Pulp & Paper Company had a pulp and paper mill at Espanola. The Haight & Dickson Lumber Company had a sawmill near Creighton and the Mond Nickel Company opened the North Star Mine near Creighton as well. Another Canadian Copper Co. mine was served at Crean Hill. A yard, offices, engine repair facility and deep water port was located at Turner, directly opposite Little Current on Goat Island. Lease by CPR The Lake Superior Corporation entered financial difficulty during the Great Depression. In March 1930 the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) leased the AER for 999 years. Under CPR management, the tracks of the AER were consolidated and merged into the CPR system. System rationalization eventually saw duplicate AER tracks between Sudbury and Espanola removed. AER tracks serving metal mining and smelting industries in the Sudbury area were maintained as spurs. The AER line from Espanola south to Turner and Little Current was renamed the Little Current Subdivision and remained active into the 1970s for transporting iron ore pellets to a ship loader at Turner for furtherance on lakers and coal from Turner to smelters in the Sudbury Basin. By the 1980s, traffic on the Little Current Sub had entered decline as metal products were no longer being shipped by lakers from Turner. The 1913-era Little Current Swing Bridge built by the AER had been converted by CPR to a dual railway and road vehicle bridge in 1946; the 1980s traffic declines saw CPR eliminate rail service to Little Current and the bridge became exclusively a road vehicle bridge. During the 1990s the line between Espanola and Turner was downgraded by CPR to the Little Current Spur and eventually abandoned south of the pulp mill in Espanola. Today, aside from remote sections of industrial track in the Sudbury area, the only remnant of the AER in operation is the Little Current Spur which runs from the former CPR mainline (now operated by the Huron Central Railway ) at McKerrow south to Espanola. Geography The development of the Manitoulin and North Shore, or Algoma Eastern, was first and foremost guided by the presence and location of various natural resources along Lake Huron's North Shore, as well as the Sudbury Basin. American industrialist Francis Clergue had recently boosted the pulp and paper industry around Sault Ste. Marie, creating another market for the North Shore logging industry. The need for sulfuric acid in paper-making drove Clergue's interest in far eastern nickel-mining locations near Sudbury, which were quite distant from his Lake Superior Corporation's Sault Ste. Marie-based business empire. These far eastern properties, the Gertrude and Elsie mines, soon became important to the Lake Superior Corporation, and drove the demand for a rail link. Far from the original M&NS; charter of a rail link connecting Manitoulin Island to the North Shore, Clergue's 1900 charter allowed for a Sudbury-to-Sault Ste. Marie rail connection, along with the original M&NS; plan of a connection to Manitoulin. When construction began in 1901, the builders, Fauquier Brothers, avoided cutting straight through the \\"ever- present\\" rock ridges of the western Sudbury area. Instead, sidehill construction was used, creating a meandering, indirect course. The muskeg and swamp areas of the right of way resulted in the need for a number of wooden trestles or use of gravel fill. The builders did make cuts through softer clay ridges, but used an absolute minimum of track ballast, inevitably causing the rails under the weight of trains to be submerged in mud during or after wet weather. Around the same time, a then-unconnected section was constructed of what would ultimately be the Algoma Eastern line, from Stanley Junction (later McKerrow) south to what would become Espanola, through the hills north of the La Cloche Mountains and across the Spanish River. This spur was promptly leased to Canadian Pacific, as there was no way for Algoma Eastern to service it from its Sudbury yard without using Canadian Pacific's tracks. Sluggishly, and after a number of financial and management setbacks with its parent company, the Lake Superior Corporation, the Manitoulin and North Shore Railway continued to push west from Sudbury throughout the late 1900s and early 1910s, maintaining its plans to build all the way to Sault Ste. Marie and to connect to its spur at Stanley Junction. From Turbine to Nairn, the M&NS; line roughly paralleled the CPR line and ran on the south shore of the Spanish River, but was often no more than five or six feet above the river's summer level, and spring flood-waters \\"must have been a chronic problem.\\" At the same time, earlier sections of the line closer to Sudbury were improved with some draining of the muskeg lands and improvement of the line's infrastructure, which was not completely successful. The first train to cross the Little Current Swing Bridge, hauled by Locomotive #51. In April 1913, railway construction had carved its way through the La Cloche Mountains to Turner, which was across the North Channel from Little Current on Manitoulin Island, and which was the chosen location for dock facilities, as well as the railway's western yard. By October, the now-iconic Little Current Swing Bridge was open, allowing trains (and later, road vehicles) to cross the North Channel. In the time after the construction of the railway, the area's environment would be slowly transformed. Hydroelectric power operations such as the INCO High Falls and Nairn Falls Dam and Generating Plant would help to slightly stabilize the seasonal flooding of the Spanish River through the creation of the Agnew Lake reservoir upstream. As well, the clay belts and muskeg west of Sudbury would always be challenging terrain, and as active and passive deforestation due to industrial operations at locations like O'Donnell devastated the environment in the area, it would become even more desolate, and less attractive to permanent human habitation. Today much of that area of the line, both active and disused, is relatively remote, and is still used for Vale Limited industrial operations. Rolling stock Before its acquisition by Canadian Pacific, the Algoma Eastern Railway had a small but significant amount of steam-driven rolling stock, which serviced its passenger and freight operations. After Canadian Pacific took over its operations, the surviving rolling stock was used by Canadian Pacific alongside CP's own vehicles and equipment to service the line as it was gradually abandoned. Locomotives Locomotive #51, a 2-6-0 \\"Mogul\\". Algoma Eastern's first locomotive, acquired during its M&NS; days, was a 2-6-0 \\"Mogul\\" engine built by Montreal Locomotive Works (MLW #41092) in 1907. Originally designated as Algoma Central #27, it was transferred from its sister railway (Algoma Central) to Algoma Eastern and renumbered as Algoma Eastern #50. Another 2-6-0 engine followed in 1912, this time a brand new unit (MLW #51183) built in September of that year, which became Algoma Eastern #51. Both of these 2-6-0 locomotives were smaller and lighter than the 2-8-0 freight locomotives the company would later acquire, and were used for passenger service. They were also joined in 1912 by an older 4-6-0 locomotive, built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works (BLW #20272) in 1902, a type commonly used for express passenger service due to its capacity for sustained high speeds; it was designated Algoma Eastern #40. After this, Algoma Eastern began to acquire a number of 2-8-0 \\"Consolidation\\" freight locomotives, which would complete the company's locomotive roster. The first, in February 1913, was Algoma Eastern #52 (or MLW #51182), which was capable of a higher tractive effort than any engine the company currently had. After the end of the First World War, several even more powerful locomotives were purchased: Algoma Eastern #53 and #54 (Canadian Locomotive Company #1351 and #1352) in 1916, and Algoma Eastern #55 and #56 in 1921. At least one other 2-8-0 locomotive, Algoma Eastern #58, was included in rosters, but was likely borrowed or on lease from another railway. Algoma Eastern's Official Railway Equipment Registers show an all-time peak locomotive roster of ten, in 1919‚Äì20, up from three in 1914/5; this would decline to eight thereafter and stabilize at that number until the end of the Algoma Eastern Railway Company in 1930. Every documented Algoma Eastern locomotive is known to have been scrapped other than #58; #40 and #50 in 1927, #51 in 1952, and the remainder from 1955‚Äì57 during the height of the dieselization era. Passenger cars Algoma Eastern's passenger car roster was eclectic and poorly documented, with a sizable portion of it being transferred from the Algoma Central, and at least one car being purchased secondhand from an equipment dealer. The earliest known passenger car was a combine car, #201, which was transferred from Algoma Central in April 1911, and originally purchased from Fitshugh & Co. (an equipment dealer) in August 1900; it was possibly originally owned by the abortive Iron Range and Huron Bay Railroad in Michigan. In 1913, a dedicated passenger coach, #81 (second-class and smoking), was transferred from the Algoma Central, which had seating for 70‚Äì86 passengers, and was built in September 1912 by either Canadian Car and Foundry (CCF) or the Preston Car Company, and which was probably a rebuilt baggage car. At the other end of the spectrum were a pair of brand-new dedicated first-class passenger cars built by CCF in August 1912. With another pair of combines and a dedicated baggage car, this completed a roster of one baggage car, three combines (one of which was later converted to a second baggage car), and three coaches. After the takeover by Canadian Pacific, the passenger cars were all retained (with the exception of the oldest combine, which had already been disposed of ten years before) and renumbered according to Canadian Pacific's own numbering scheme. The baggage car was the first to be scrapped, in 1941, and the last, the pair of first-class coaches, were scrapped at the CPR Angus Shops in 1958. No passenger cars are known to have survived to the present day. Freight cars As a railway which primarily hauled freight, the Algoma Eastern owned over 500 freight cars during its nearly twenty-year existence, though its freight roster was constantly fluctuating. This included boxcars, flatcars, gondolas, ore cars, several maintenance of way vehicles, and two cabooses. Of these, the majority were flatcars, creating important logistical capacity for the timber industry, followed by boxcars and gondolas. The railway undertook a major fleet renewal in 1919‚Äì22, when many of its older freight cars were scrapped, and new ones were purchased; this coincided with the purchase of its most powerful freight locomotives. Many cars were gradually scrapped or sold off throughout the 1920s‚Äì30s, especially as the Great Depression reduced freight volumes, and only a dramatically reduced number of freight cars survived to be transferred to the CPR. Infrastructure=Facilities Espanola station 1923. The Algoma Eastern Railway's infrastructure was built and dismantled by necessity and evolved over time, though by the railway's early-1920s heyday it had largely stabilized. After the railway's acquisition by Canadian Pacific, much of the infrastructure would be slowly removed, especially as the towns and industries it served declined. At the time of its 1930 lease to CP, it had seven full stations (at Copper Cliff, Creighton, Nairn, Espanola, Birch Island, McGregor Bay, and access to the shared CPR station in Sudbury), along with passenger shelters at many locations along the track. Previously, Algoma Eastern had also used the now-demolished Canadian National station located in Sudbury's Flour Mill district, and very early in its operations had picked up passengers at the Elm Street crossing where its tracks joined with Canadian Pacific's. After the end of passenger service, all of these stations were gradually demolished by CP Rail, some as late as the Espanola station in 1990. The sole known survivor is the Willisville passenger shelter, which was relocated to private property and is in use as a shed. Also in 1930, the railway had seven section houses, a type of railway facility often used to temporarily house workers or to store supplies. These consisted of two in Creighton and one each in Mond, Drury, Espanola, Whitefish Falls, and Turner. As a steam railway, the Algoma Eastern had a number of steam locomotive facilities such as engine houses at Sudbury and Turner; coal facilities at Sudbury, Turner, and Creighton; and water facilities at Sudbury, Turner, Crean Hill, Espanola, and Whitefish Falls. None of these facilities are known to have survived. Trackage Construction of the line through a rock cut near Whitefish Falls in 1913. The original Manitoulin and North Shore Railway tracks used 60-pound steel rails, and were laid from Sudbury for 14 miles up to Gertrude, with a three-track yard in Sudbury for train depot operations. By 1910 the M&NS; had switched to using 80-pound rails. A number of junctions and wyes existed along the Algoma Eastern during its history, as the railway facilitated bidirectional freight traffic from freight sources near the middle of the line, as well as rail-ship intermodal freight near the west end. The most famous of these is the Clara Belle or Clarabelle Junction near Copper Cliff, which is still in use today. This junction connected Algoma Eastern and Canadian Pacific tracks and allowed ore from mines like at Creighton to be moved eastward. Other junctions, such as Stanley junction (now McKerrow), grew up into small towns, in part due to the presence of significant industries nearby, or the advantages created by the presence of other rail lines. Elsie Junction, the location of one of the Algoma Eastern's earliest stations, faded from prominence after the First World War, in no small part due to the closure of the Elsie Mine, and was approximately replaced by Nickelton, the location of the British-American Nickel Company (BANC) smelter, which was near the Murray Mine. After the collapse of the BANC in 1924, the spur from Nickelton junction was abandoned, though it was later temporarily rebuilt to serve the Murray Mine again in 1940. While a number of potential junction points and interchanges with the Canadian Pacific were not used, such as at Crean Hill, others were set up further west. One of the more significant was at Turbine, where the Canadian Pacific and Algoma Eastern rights of way nearly overlapped, and an interchange was set up, along with a Canadian Copper Company (later Inco) spur which diverged from the Algoma Eastern heading north to the High Falls hydroelectric facility. The right of way for the spur is now used as an access road for the facility, which is still active today. At Nairn, built from scratch as a Canadian Pacific railway town, the Algoma Eastern also provided passenger service, and the Algoma Eastern and Canadian Pacific lines crossed each other at Algoma Eastern's mile 38 milepoint, just west of the town. Further to the west, the Algoma Eastern had a stretch of track consisting of its station at Espanola, the Espanola rail bridge across the Spanish River, a north-south-east wye connecting to the rest of its mainline to the south and east, and to the north a short spur connecting it to the Canadian Pacific mainline at Stanley Junction. Over time Stanley Junction became known by several names, as in 1919 the CPR station there was renamed to Espanola station, despite this station being some distance from the town of Espanola, and the Algoma Eastern already operating an Espanola station. After Canadian Pacific's takeover of the Algoma Eastern, it then had ownership of two Espanola stations, so the Stanley Junction station was renamed again to McKerrow.

Beside the basic Confucianism learned from his father, he also studied elementary school in Ha Tinh town. After finishing elementary school in 1919 he entered Hue National School. In 1923, he graduated with honors in Diplomacy and was assigned to teach at Nha Trang Primary School (now Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Tr·ªói High School) until 1926.  Revolutionary activity Under the influence of his father, during his time as an elementary school teacher, in addition to teaching the young, he also taught workers and the poor. He paid for books for his poor students out of his salary. His activities were endorsed by a number of young intellectuals and introduced him to a political organization called the Vietnam Society, which later formed the T√¢n Vi·ªát Revolutionary Party.Hoang Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang: A Contemporary History of a National Struggle 2008 Page 244 \\"Later, a number of cadres in the New Vietnam Revolutionary Party (TVCMƒê) - H√† Huy T·∫≠p, Tr·∫ßn Ph√∫, and Tr·∫ßn Ph·∫°m H·ªì - disbanded and formed the Indo-Chinese Communist League\\"Ng√†y n√†y nƒÉm x∆∞a - VƒÉn H·∫£i Nguy·ªÖn (journalist.), VƒÉn H·∫£i Nguy·ªÖn, ƒê√†i ph√°t thanh v√† truy·ªÅn h√¨nh H√† N·ªôi - 1998 Page 222 \\"√ê·ªìng ch√≠ H√† Huy T·∫≠p Sinh ng√†y 24-4-1906 t·∫°i t·ªânh H√† Tƒ©nh, hy Sinh ng√†y 28-8-1941 t·∫°i H√≥c M√¥n, t·ªânh Gia ƒê·ªãnh cu.

Thus, in mid-1926, he was sacked and expelled from Nha Trang by the colonial authorities. In August 1926, he found teaching jobs in Cao Xu√¢n D·ª•c primary school In Ngh·ªá An. In March 1927, he moved to Saigon to work, make a living, and teach in An Nam Nguyen school. He also continued teaching poor laborers, thereby propagating the patriotic spirit and the revolutionary idea of independence. Because of these activities, in January 1928, he was fired again from An Nam school. However, he continued to teach and propagate the revolution from B√† R·ªãa, Bi√™n H√≤a, S√†i G√≤n, Gia ƒê·ªãnh. In July 1928, he went to the North, tasked with communicating with the Vietnam Revolutionary Youth Association in an effort to unite all anti-colonial organizations in a joint action organization. In December 1928, he was sent to Guangzhou to attend a training session of the Vietnam Revolutionary Youth Association. Impressed strongly with the thought of Nguy·ªÖn √Åi Qu·ªëc and ƒê∆∞·ªùng K√°ch M·ªánh, he actively participated in the Vietnam Revolutionary Youth Association. On July 19, 1929, he went to the Soviet Union, studying at the Communist International University of the Communist International in Moscow, nicknamed SinichkinÔºà–°–∏–Ω–∏—á–∫–∏–Ω). In late 1929, he was admitted to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolshevik). During this time he drafted the \\"Indochinese Communist Party Action Plan\\" and \\"The History of the Communist Movement in Indochina\\". In April 1934, he graduated from the University and returned to Vietnam. On his way he was arrested by the French, then deported to Belgium, after which he returned to China, where he was appointed by the Communist International to join the Foreign Brigades of the Indochinese Communist Party, led by L√™ H·ªìng Phong as Secretary. From 16 to 21 June 1934, the congress of the Indochinese Communist Party Committee and representatives of the Party organizations in the country were organized, including L√™ H·ªìng Phong, 'H√† Huy T·∫≠p, Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn D·ª±t, Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Tham and Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn Ch·∫•n. The conference adopted the Political Resolution and the Resolution on Organizational Matters. In March 1935, at the First Party Congress in Macau, L√™ H·ªìng Phong was elected General Secretary. Ha Huy Tap was elected to the Central Executive Committee and was appointed as the Secretary of the Overseas Command. In July 1936, the Overseas Committee of the Party met for the first conference, the Central Committee sent him back to repatriate the Party Central Committee and held the post of General Secretary from July 26. He directed the L'Avant garde (1937), the People's Party (1938) in the name of \\"labor and people\\" in Cochinchina. From September 3 to September 5, 1937, the Central Conference met in Ba Dinh, Gia Dinh, where he reported on the leadership of the party from the first Congress to 1937. On March 30, 1938, together with his predecessor Le Hong Phong, he chaired the third meeting of the Party Central Committee at Ba Diem. At this conference, he resigned as General Secretary, but still joined the Central Committee of the Party. His successor was Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn C·ª´. On May 1, 1938, he was arrested while attending International Labor Day in Saigon. He was expelled from Cochinchina and sent to his hometown. By March 30, 1940, he was arrested and sent to Cochinchina for trial. On October 25 of that year, he was sentenced by the French colonial government to five years in prison. At this trial, he and his comrades were represented by young lawyer Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Huy·ªÅn, who later served as the Vice President of the Republic of Vietnam, as a defense lawyer. On March 25, 1941, the French government changed his sentence to death for \\"being responsible for the spirit of the insurrection of Cochinchina\\".

The museum's exhibitions focus on the history of Modoc County beginning with Native American history and objects. The museum also has a collection of firearms from 15th century up to World War II. Outside the museum is Southern Pacific 2718, a steam locomotive that was used in the area. History The main collection base for the museum was started in 1926 by Marc and Myrtle Bellis from Alturas. They first started collecting Native American and pioneer objects, and photographs and papers. They bought the gun collection of Nathan Rogers in 1932, a collection which stems back to 1870. The couple had a private museum in their attic. In 1966 the collection was purchased by a group of businessmen from Alturas. They hoped to open a museum, and in 1967 Modoc County bought the collection. The collection was located at the Veterans Memorial Building at Rachael Dorris Park. In 1968 it opened to the public. An expansion took place in 1984. Collections and exhibitions The Modoc County Historical Museum has one of the largest collections of firearms in California. Early guns include a 15th- century blunderbuss. Exhibitions touch on the migratory bird hunting history of the region and showcases 10-gauge shotguns and a large three-gauge shotgun. A Marlin Ballard 40-90 caliber with a cartridge approximately 4 inches long. The museums collection of Native American objects is larger than its firearm collection. It has objects as old as 8,000 years old. The collection showcases the lives and history of three regional communities: the Pit River Tribe, the Modoc, and Paiute people. Other parts of the collection include objects from other Indigenous peoples of the Great Basin. The museum also has a small collection of United States military objects including items from the United States Cavalry, World War I and World War II. Another small collection consists of various colored glass jars and bottles used in World War I, made from selenium owing to glass shortages in Europe. The museum also has railroad clocks, an Estey Organ, pipes and lighters, an iron lung, woodworking tools, cattle brands, Chinese bottles, clothing and animal skins.

Bowers makes many claims about the sex lives of many people, most of whom were associated with the Hollywood movie industry during that period. The book, which was vetted by a libel lawyer before publication, was refused by several publishers before ultimately being accepted by Grove Press and Grove/Atlantic. Matt Tyrnauer, director of Valentino: The Last Emperor (2008), produced a documentary film about Bowers's life, entitled Scotty and the Secret History of Hollywood, released in 2017.  Summary  Bowers fought in the Pacific, including at the Battle of Iwo Jima, as a paramarine in the Marine Corps during World War II. In 1946 he was pumping gas at a service station in Hollywood when he says Walter Pidgeon gave him $20 for a gay sexual encounter. Word spread about Bowers among Pidgeon's friends, and Bowers turned the service station into a meeting place for paid sexual encounters, which took place in a nearby trailer or hotel, with his old marine friends assisting him in the business. In 1950 he stopped working at the service station and began a legitimate business as a party bartender. Bowers became well known in Hollywood for arranging sexual encounters for gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, and heterosexuals as part of his party service. In the book Bowers claims he arranged gay or bisexual encounters for many actors and notable persons. Bowers' illicit activities were never detected by the authorities; he kept all his contact information in his head. During the popularity of the film Deep Throat, Bowers claims to have arranged for Linda Lovelace to give instruction on deepthroating at parties. He also claims to have provided women‚Äîmostly prostitutes‚Äîto Alfred Kinsey as interview subjects for his famous study on human sexuality. Gore Vidal wrote that Bowers was a long time friend whose stories he believed. Bowers ended this business when the AIDS epidemic began, though he continued to work as a handyman and bartender during this time. In 1984 he married Lois. Bowers said he never took payment for arranging sexual encounters for others, only when he provided sex himself, and that though he was bisexual, his own preference was for women. Bowers never talked publicly about these experiences before but decided to do so because most of the people involved are now dead and can no longer be affected by his revelations. On June 10, 2012, Bowers was featured on the show CBS News Sunday Morning.  Reception  Adam Tschorn, writing for the Los Angeles Times, described the book as having an uneven, at times choppy, pace and much purple prose, highlighting a passage in which Bowers describes how he milked a cow. Although he considered some of the details too much for the general reader, he wrote that the book was \\"a good trashy read\\". Matt Tyrnauer, a writer for Vanity Fair, described Bowers as \\"like the Kinsey Reports live and in living color\\", if the reader believed him. Joanna Walters, in The Guardian, wrote that the book was a \\"titillating catalogue of sexual intrigue.\\"  Film adaptation  Matt Tyrnauer, director of Valentino: The Last Emperor (2008), directed a docudrama film adaptation titled Scotty and the Secret History of Hollywood, released in 2017.

Stories of his exploits circulated for many years Requires subscription and were alluded to in books such as Hollywood Babylon. Bowers‚Äô claims were met with both praise and skepticism. Bowers decided to talk publicly about his life when most of the people involved were dead and, in his words, \\"The truth can‚Äôt hurt them anymore.\\" In 2012, the publication of his memoir Full Service, written by Lionel Friedberg from 150 hours of interviews, drew publicity, including a profile in The New York Times, and a feature on CBS News Sunday Morning. One journalist wrote, \\"He has a savant-like quality: a result of his refusal to be embarrassed by sex.\\"  Life and career  Bowers was born in Ottawa, Illinois, the son of Edna (Ostrander) and Glen Bowers. After working his way through the Depression in Chicago, he fought in the Pacific, including at the Battle of Iwo Jima, as a Paramarine in the Marine Corps during World War II, losing his brother and two close friends. According to his memoir, his sexual career began in 1946 while he was working as an attendant at the Richfield Oil gas station located at 5777 Hollywood Boulevard, at the corner of Van Ness Avenue. In 1950 Bowers stopped working at the service station and began working as a party bartender, while continuing his sexual services. He also claimed to have provided women, mostly prostitutes, to Alfred Kinsey as interview subjects for his study on human sexuality. Bowers was never prosecuted by the authorities for his activities; he kept all his contact information in his head. The actor Beach Dickerson willed three houses to Bowers In his autobiography, Bowers claimed that cinematographer N√©stor Almendros bequeathed him his Oscar. On July 8, 1984, he married cabaret singer Lois J. Broad, ten years his junior. She died in 2018. Bowers died at his home in Los Angeles on October 13, 2019 at the age of 96. The cause of death was kidney failure.  Support of claims  According to film critic Peter Debruge, writing for Variety in 2006: \\"Everyone knows Scotty. After all, he‚Äôs been serving drinks to the Beverly Hills crowd for almost 60 years, working a different party almost every night of the week, sometimes two a day.\\" Gore Vidal, maintaining Bowers' account was accurate, spoke at the official launch of the memoir; it was Vidal's last public appearance. Robert Benevides, the partner of actor Raymond Burr, said to the LA Weekly: \\"Scotty just liked to make people happy.\\" Film director John Schlesinger and investigative reporter and novelist Dominick Dunne also backed Bowers‚Äô claims. Joan Allemand, a former arts director of the Beverly Hills Unified School District, who knew Bowers for more than 20 years and introduced him to his subsequent co-writer, Lionel Friedberg, said: \\"Scotty doesn't lie about anything. He's a poor kid from a farm in Illinois, and when he got here, his two assets were his big penis and charming personality. That's what he used to feed his family.\\" Sir Cecil Beaton wrote of his sexual encounters with Bowers in his published diary of the 1960s, while Debbie Reynolds wrote in her memoirs of Milton Berle employing him for a party prank. Bowers appears in John Rechy's 1963 roman-√†-clef City of Night as the character 'Smitty'. A profile in the New York Social Diary stated: \\"Clients all agreed that he was 'very good' at what he did, and very agreeable... And very discreet. He did not discriminate. He even had one regular longtime client... who had no arms and no legs... The Scotty I knew was a guy who always seemed to be enjoying his life working morning, noon and night, with never a gripe; always with a smile to greet you, and never with an axe to grind. After a lifetime in Hollywood, that's a remarkable feat and its own kind of Zen.\\" It has been suggested that Bowers' claims were dismissed by some not simply because \\"virtually everyone he talks about has died\\", but because \\"many in the industry still cling to a prudish, homophobic and manufactured version of the past.\\" According to Matt Tyrnauer, director of a documentary on Bowers, it is merely proof of \\"the enduring power of the (Hollywood) myth machine... created there‚Äîby outsiders, Jewish immigrants themselves who were furriers and glove manufacturers projecting a lie of a made-up image of white Americanism... I think there are a lot of people who want to cling to that.\\" Author William J. Mann, who interviewed Bowers for a biography of Katharine Hepburn, said, \\"I found him forthright and honest and not interested in personal fame or gain.\\" At that time he turned down Mann's offer to write about him or introduce him to a literary agent. Author and journalist Tim Teeman, who also interviewed Bowers, wrote that \\"as candid as Bowers was, he was also respectful, and when it came to sex and sexuality utterly without shame and judgment.\\"  Other writings and appearances  Bowers authored the introduction to a collection of archival photographs of male affection in the military, My Buddy: World War II Laid Bare. In March 2016 he wrote a profile of himself for the Guest of a Guest blog. He also appears in Sir Cecil Beaton's published diary for the 1960s, Beaton terming him \\"a phenomenon\\", and the biography In Bed With Gore Vidal. Bowers also assisted a number of authors, including Vincente Minnelli biographer Mark Griffin and William J. Mann, author of Behind the Screen: How Gays and Lesbians Shaped Hollywood. In popular culture A character based on Bowers during the heyday of his gas station operation is portrayed by Dylan McDermott in the 2020 Ryan Murphy Netflix miniseries Hollywood.https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/hollywood- ryan-murphy-scotty-bowers-gas-station-sex-ring-994838/ A documentary about Bowers, titled Scotty and the Secret History of Hollywood, was released in 2017, directed by Matt Tyrnauer. In The Hollywood Reporter, its reviewer commented: \\"At a certain point, anyone who reads Bowers‚Äô book or sees this film has to decide whether to believe him or not. At this stage, there is no reason not to; Scotty does not seem remotely like a braggart or someone desperate for a sliver of late-in-life fame... When Scotty says he likes to make people happy, he clearly includes himself, and that he seems to have done in spades.\\" In July 2020, it was announced Searchlight Pictures had acquired the rights to the documentary and was developing a feature film based on Bowers' life. Luca Guadagnino was hired to direct, with Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg writing the script.

In the lower left, a life reconstruction of Afrotarsius is shown. The first species to be named, Afrotarsius chatrathi, was named in 1985 on the basis of a single lower jaw from the Oligocene of Fayum, Egypt, and tentatively referred to the tarsier family (Tarsiidae). However, this relationship immediately proved controversial, and in 1987 the animal was placed in a separate family Afrotarsiidae related to simians. A tarsier-like tibiofibula was allocated to Afrotarsius in 1998, but the identity of this bone is controversial. In 2010, a second species of the genus, Afrotarsius libycus, was named from the Eocene of Dur At-Talah, Libya, on the basis of isolated upper and lower teeth. Features of these teeth were interpreted as additional evidence for a relationship between Afrotarsius and anthropoids. A second afrotarsiid genus, Afrasia, was named in 2012 from the Eocene Pondaung Formation of Myanmar.

Biography  It was at the age of fifteen that Andr√©-L√©on Vivrel decided that he would be a painter. After some initial reservation, his family were favourable. His mother, L√©onie, herself an amateur painter, was the first to support him, encouraging her son, who was later to say that she had been his only master. His very first painting was thanks to her: ‚ÄòI remember it well, it was a small landscape, a view of a wood. [‚Ä¶] I was about fifteen.‚Äô His father, a wine merchant, proudly recalled that he had himself received a first prize for drawing in 1870, a childhood memory that kept him from forcing his son to join the family business. After obligatory military service, Vivrel entered the Acad√©mie Julian in 1910 to study with Paul-Albert Laurens; he also frequented the ateliers of Marcel Baschet and Henri Royer at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. This was a carefree time: Vivrel never missed the Quat‚Äôz‚Äô Arts ball, appearing as a Roman, an Egyptian and a Cro-Magnon man. He rented a studio in Montmartre, the centre of all this revelry, at 65 rue Caulaincourt, only eight numbers along from that of Auguste Renoir.  World War I and the return to Paris  Vivrel exhibited for the first time at the Salon des Artistes Fran√ßais in 1913, and again the next year. His career was interrupted by the First World War. Called up on 2 August 1914, he proved his valour at Verdun and was awarded the Croix de guerre for heroic conduct in 1917. That same year, on short leave, he married Germaine Degoul. Before returning to the front, the soldier-painter left his family with a self- portrait in which he represented himself flanked by his mother and his young wife. After the war Vivrel returned to his studio in Montmartre. With the art market depressed, times were hard, in spite of a Mention Honorable at the 1920 Salon and the purchase by the French state of the two still lifes he sent to the Salon des Ind√©pendants that same year. At this Salon he also exhibited two portraits of Breton women, painted on his return from the fishing port of Ploumanac‚Äôh (C√¥tes d‚ÄôArmor). The thickly applied paint and loose handling of Vivrel's naturalist portrait recall of the work of √âdouard Manet, especially his still lifes.  Salons and exhibitions  In 1921 Vivrel began regularly exhibiting nudes in the Parisians Salons, reaping a rich harvest of medals and awards. His first attempts in this genre dated from just after the war. In 1922 Vivrel made his first appearance at the Salon de la Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts. In 1932 Vivrel won the Deldebat de Gonzalva prize, and, in 1933, a silver medal at the Salon des Artistes Fran√ßais for Le Temps des cerises. The following year he exhibited his baigneuses, the first in a series of large- format nudes sent to the Salon up to 1943. Following a long tradition developed by Courbet, Vivrel used the timeless bather theme as a pretext for revelling in painting the female body, almost invariably in a riparian setting. The bathers subject had remained topical and worthily represented at the Salon since the early 20th century by the envois of √âmile Ren√© Menard, Paul Chabas and Maurice Denis. In Jeunesse (Youth), his submission to the 1936 Salon, Vivrel somewhat humorously captures the modesty of a teenage girl awkwardly using a straw hat to cover her nudity. In these paintings with two or three figures the painter varied the positions of his models following a schema taken from Jeunes filles au bord de la mer by Pierre Puvis de Chavannes. The culmination of his work on painting female nudes, the Baigneuses of 1939, was awarded a gold medal at the Salon des Artistes Fran√ßais; before this he had won a silver medal at the 1937 Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques de Paris, where Henri-Alexandre Sollier also won a prize.  The art of landscape  He explored the landscape genre continuously throughout his career as he discovered new regions. His base, however, was always the Loiret, where his elder brother, Marcel, had a house in Chatillon-sur-Loire, not far from Champtoceaux, home of Paul Deltombe. It was here, during the penurious period after the war, that he came to live and paint. Neighbours remembered the picturesque figure of the painter cycling along the riverside with a cloche hat pulled down over his ears, a canvas strapped on his back and painting equipment bulging out of his panniers. Thus equipped, he set out for the day to attempt to recapture the ‚Äòinstantaneous impression‚Äô of what he observed.  The parisian model  When not travelling around France, Vivrel took Paris as his model. He painted the alleys of Montmartre and the other evocative neighbourhoods and monuments around the capital, such as Notre-Dame Cathedral, which he represented from every side and at all times of day, and, above all, the banks of the Seine, which afforded so many surprising views of the city. His Parisian views have close affinities to those of Albert Lebourg, in which we find the same quality of atmospheric light and the dissolution of architectural forms in the sky and water of the river. Vivrel was viscerally attached to Paris.  Painter of diversity  The exhibition organised at Galerie de Berri in May 1942, Vivrel ‚Äì peinture r√©centes, featured thirty-one paintings illustrating the diversity of the genres he worked in throughout his career. The artist limited himself to still lifes only when the weather prevented him from getting out of the studio. He painted them without regret, though, since the key thing for him was simply not to stop painting. In old age he recognised that painting had always acted on him like a drug. In the same interview this perfectionist admitted to having destroyed many of his paintings that he found imperfect. This rigour confirmed what critics had seen in him when he was ‚Äòvirtually an unknown‚Äô: ‚Äòtaste, a good eye and accomplishment‚Äô ‚Äì and this was notwithstanding the illustrious elders, Pierre Bonnard, Henri Lebasque and Pablo Picasso, exhibited alongside Vivrel at Galerie Th. Briant in 1933. Continuing to paint as long as he drew breath, Andr√©-L√©on Vivrel died in Montmartre on 7 April 1976.  Works in public institutions  *Rochers, 1927.

Overview Few men have impacted the sport of drag racing like Jenkins. His storied drag racing career began in the late 1950s and continued right up until his death in March 2012. Throughout his career, both innovation and success followed him closely. This book documents the long and colorful history of the 17 competition cars that proudly bore the name, Grumpy's Toy. Grumpy's Toys stands as a full and complete history of Jenkins' career as told through his cars and has been heartily authorized by the man himself (Jenkins wrote the book's foreword.) Input from Grumpy punctuates the tales behind the now-legendary cars. Many myths about both Jenkins and his formidable racing cars have grown over the decades, and Jenkins himself helps to separate the fact from the fiction. Jenkins' initial claim to fame would be his tune up service that would, in 1961 lead into a partnership with Dave Strickler, which lasted through 1964. All of Strickler's Old Reliable cars are discussed here with supporting tales from Bill himself and photos from the collection of the Strickler family. This book takes you through the Dodge Boys cars, the break up of Strickler and Jenkins, and also looks at the Black Arrow Plymouth that followed. Black Arrow would bring Jenkins his first NHRA Championship in 1965, his only non Chevrolet national event win. Read how Jenkins had hoped to obtain a Chrysler deal of his own and why the attempt failed. The Black Arrow controversy is finally put to rest with the help of reclusive Doc Burgess. The Chevy IIs, the factory supplied Camaros, Vegas and Monzas are all discussed in proceeding chapters. The book does get into factory ties and Jenkins' relationship with the likes of Vince Piggins, Paul Prior and Ron Sperry. Chevrolets supply of cars and parts would start in 1966 when Vince Piggins came knocking on the door. National events are covered throughout with an appendix dedicated to Grumpy's Toys national event wins and runners-up along with a complete list of winning customer cars that were prepared by Jenkins Competition. Contributors included the likes of Jere Stahl, Mike Strickler, Bud Faubel, Pete Preston, Doc Burgess, Bruce Tucker, Pete Hutchinson, Derrick Von Bargen, Ed Quay, Ken Dondero, Steve Johns, Joe Lepone Jr, Darwin Doll, John Jadauga etc., etc. Jenkins was on board from the get go and tales of his \\"trip\\" help make this book a memorial read. The book does open with an informative look at Jenkins' early up bringing and early interests in life. The closing chapter takes a look at what Bill has been up to since the sell of the last Grumpys Toy at the end of 1983. The old saying goes that idle hands are the devils tool, well with no car to maintain, Bill would find other ways to keep plenty busy. Extensive work for Chevrolet would fill his time along with reverting to building engines for customers. Winners in Pro Stock, Pro Stock Truck, Comp Eliminator would follow and are all touched on in the closing chapter, Beyond the Toys. Over 300 photos help tell the story of Jenkins' career, approximately 95% of which have never seen print. Included are images from Bill's personal collection.

He launched a war against Tunis, and led the attacks of Barbary privateers on American ships. An expedition of the US Navy led by Commodore Stephen Decatur in command of a squadron of nine ships, was conducted in 1815 against the Regency of Algiers. The episode is known as the Second Barbary War. The operation forced Dey Omar to sign a treaty ending attacks of piracy, a treaty that he denounced shortly thereafter. The Congress of Vienna, which addressed the problem of Christian slaves from Barbary piracy, charged the United Kingdom and the Netherlands to negotiate with the Dey of Algiers and the Beys of Tunis and Tripoli. Although the latter two were agreeable, Omar Agha was not. It would take the 9-hour Bombardment of Algiers (1816) on 27 August 1816, by an Anglo-Dutch naval force commanded by British Admiral Lord Exmouth, to compel the Dey to abolish Christian slavery. However, the bombardment of Algiers did not destroy Barbary power. Despite the signing of the treaty and the release of 3,000 christian slaves, Dey Omar set to rebuilding the city's defences, putting its Jewish inhabitants to forced labour in the place of Christian slaves. Moreover, the problem remained such that it was one of the main areas of contention at the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818). Regardless, the Janissaries came for the Dey on the morning of September 8, 1817 and had him strangled and buried within an hour. Following his repeated defeats and domestic uproar, a new Dey was soon proclaiming defiance.FO 3/19, McDonell to Bathhurst, 8 September 1817 His successor was Ali ben Ahmed.

(2005) Biomimetic Synthesis and Structure Elucidation of Rubicordifolin, a Cytotoxic Natural Product from Rubia cordifolia. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 127, 2870-2871. The molecule is isolated from the roots of Rubia cordifolia and was first characterized in 1993.Itokawa, H., Ibrahein, Z.Z., Qiao, Y.F., Takeya, K. (1993) Anthraquinones, Naphthohydroquinones, and Naphthohydroquinone Dimers from Rubia cordifolia and Their Cytoxic Activity. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 41, 1869-1872. In 2004, the first synthesis of rubicordifolin was accomplished. The molecule has been shown to have cytotoxic properties in vitro. Biosynthesis A biosynthetic pathway for rubicordifolin has not yet been elucidated. However, it has been hypothesized that the dimerization of the two naphthoquinone units yields rubicordifolin. Naphthoquinones can be traced back to the shikimate pathway in plants. Shikimate is converted into chorismic acid, which is further converted into 2-succinylbenzoic acid through a TPP-dependent reaction.Schultz, G., Soll, J., Diedler, E., Schulze-Siebert, D., (1985) Synthesis of prenylquinones in chloroplasts.

Biosynthesis of 2-succinylbenzoic acid via the shikimate pathway After 2-succinylbenzoic acid has been produced, a cyclization, a prenylation, a methylation, and an oxidation occur which yields a naphthoquinone.Heide, L., Leistner, E.

Comm. 334-336. center Once this naphthoquinone has been made, a series of oxidations and cyclizations lead to two substrates that can undergo a [4+2] cycloaddition that leads to the product. center  Synthesis  The Trauner group at UC Berkeley completed a synthesis of rubicordifolin in 2004. The synthesis of the natural product, dubbed a ‚Äúbiomimetic‚Äù synthesis, takes inspiration from the proposed dimerization of two naphthoquinones units. Mechanistically, it is proposed that the phenylboronic acid promotes a cyclization that is followed by a Diels-Alder reaction to yield the final product. center  Pharmacology  Studies of rubicordifolin demonstrate it possesses both cytotoxic properties. When tested in vitro against Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts, human nasopharynx carcinomas, and lymphocytic leukemia cells, rubicordifolin exhibited cytotoxic activities (measured in IC50, Œºg/ml) of 4.7, 2.9, and 1.2 respectively.

Unlike mirror trading, a method that allows traders to copy specific strategies, copy trading links a portion of the copying trader's funds to the account of the copied investor.Mirror trading in Investopedia Any trading action made thenceforth by the copied investor, such as opening a position, assigning Stop Loss and Take Profit orders, or closing a position, are also executed in the copying trader's account according to the proportion between the copied investor's account and the copying trader's allotted copy trading funds. The copying trader usually retains the ability to disconnect copied trades and manage them themselves. They can also close the copy relationship altogether. Copied investors are often compensated by flat monthly subscription fees on the part of a trader seeking to copy their trades. Copy trading has led to the development of a new type of investment portfolio, which some industry insiders call \\"People-Based Portfolios\\" or \\"Signal Portfolios\\" (borrowing the terminology of the popular MetaQuotes Signal Marketplace). People-based portfolios differ from traditional investment portfolios in that the investment funds are invested in other investors, rather than traditional market-based instruments.  History  Copy trading and mirror trading developed from automated trading, also known as algorithmic trading around 2005. It was an automated trading system where traders were sharing their own trading history that others could follow. Tradency was one of the first to propose an autotrading system in 2005, called by them Mirror Trader. A trader could host their own trading strategy on the systems with the trading records showing the performance of that strategy. Other users could then decide to mirror-copy on their account all the transactions generated from that strategy. This was soon followed in certain circumstances that allowed traders to connect their personal trading account directly in the platform, and from that moment each of their action was recorded and made available to the users without the need for submitting the trading strategy. Since 2010, it has become an increasingly popular feature among online financial trading brokers as a way to enable less experienced traders to benefit from the trading decisions of investors whom they deem successful.  Study  In 2012 MIT funded a study directed by Dr. Yaniv Altshuler, showed that traders on the eToro social investment network who benefited from \\"guided copying\\", i.e. copying a suggested investor, fared 6-10% better than traders who were trading manually, and 4% better than traders who were copy trading random investors of their choice. MIT study 2012 As of 2013, Dr. Altshuler has been collaborating with Professor Alex \\"Sandy\\" Pentland of MIT on a study that aims to find a \\"sustainable\\" social trading mechanism in the aim of fine tuning traders' ability to benefit from copy trading.  Regulatory issues  In 2014, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has raised concerns regarding copy trading as they deem the firms offer copy trading to be effectively unregulated investment managers. As such, the FCA has sent letters to those companies providing copy trading services notifying them of their intention to classify them as investment managers.  Methods used  Different copy trading platforms employ different copy trading logic. These usually vary in regards to the minimum copy trading amounts, the minimum amount for a copied trade, and the way money in/out operations on behalf of the copied trader are reflected in the proportions between the copied-copying accounts. Some platforms also enable traders to place Stop Loss orders on the entire copy trading relationship, allowing traders to control the risk of their copy trading activity based on the individual copied investors  Compared to social trading  Various financial trading operators offer copy trading capabilities as part of a larger social trading platform. Social trading usually includes the ability to connect with other investors using the platform in social ways (comments, likes, link sharing etc.) as well as find potential copy trading candidates by viewing investors' performance statistics. Some platforms also provide ways to sort and rank traders according to certain performance parameters, thus making it easier for traders to find potential investors to copy. Typically, trading histories of available traders to copy are available along with detailed performance and risk metrics.

The bramble Rubus trelleckensis, which is endemic to Monmouthshire, is present at the site. Other plant species present include cranberry (Vaccinium oxycoccos), bog asphodel (Narthecium ossifragum), round-leaved sundew (Drosera rotundifolia), bottle sedge (Carex rostrata) and heath spotted orchid (Dactylorhiza maculata). The site is one of the best sites for recording butterflies and moths in eastern Wales. The site's interfaces between boggy heathland and woodland, with patches of bilberry and heather grow under an open canopy of rowan and other deciduous trees, means that it is home to a variety of important lepidoptera species for Wales such as the Bilberry Pug and welsh wave moths. Cleddon Bog is important not because it has so many national rarities, the only one UK Biodiversity Action Plan Priority species present is the White-line Snout, although three Species of Conservation Concern have also been recorded, but in its diversity of species, for some of which it represents the sole Gwent site.

It features a 1 GHz AMD C-60 processor, 1 GB of RAM, a Samsung 64 GB SSD, and Radeon 6200 graphics. With respect to connectivity, it will come with two USB 2.0 ports, a Gigabit Ethernet, HDMI, SD card slot, SIM slot (with support for quad band 3G) and Bluetooth 4.0. There will be no need for any external power brick to power this device as it has its own build in power adapter. There is no WI-FI connectivity in the currently announced model and it is unknown whether there will be a version with such capabilities. It is comparable in size, usability and design as the Intel NUC. There has been no price or release date on the system, and no further details released on the topic. It is uncommon to see such a product being produced by AMD since the company hasn't played much of a role in the mini desktop scene. Since it is using an x86 based chip, it is capable of running Windows 7 which is also the operating system that it will come preinstalled with. It will also be able to support users wanting to upgrade to Windows 8 without any problems. Practical Uses The AMD LiveBox, with its small form factor, is being pushed towards basic users and the company also hopes it will grow adoption within school computer labs. Thursday, 19 January 2017 It also has the capabilities of being an HTPC (Home theater PC) with its small form factor, HDMI out and the ability to run Windows OS as well as any other x86 based OS. With its small form factor and ease the ability to easily set it up, it will also work very well for developers as a machine to develop and test on. Reception Many people are happy and excited for the device to be released, however consumers are worried about the price that it will be released for. Users believe that having Windows coming preinstalled on the device will unnecessarily raise the price of the product. Since the device is a great device to be used as an HTPC many consumers want a version without Windows preinstalled so the price will be lower and they can install Ubuntu or XBMC on it to use as a home media device.

The species are in length and are either golden-tan or yellowish-brown coloured. It takes them a year to mature into an adult, which makes them a fast-growing species. They also have a dark stripe over the mesosoma with either yellowish or orange pedipalps.Description Diet In captivity this species is fed on cockroaches and crickets. It is suggested that Shelfordella lateralis is a good species of cockroaches, that are abundant worldwide. Aside from being abundant they also are the easiest prey, since they don't hide, and the scorpion can easily eat them.Diet and pet housing As a pet The species could be housed as pets, and they can live with each other communally once into their 2nd instar. Mothers tend to eat the young on case-by-case basis. Another thing to consider if owning such species is that they need something to climb on. A cork bark is a nice climbing tool for such species if the owner will lean it against the side of the enclosure or layer it to provide ample climbing space. Artificial limbs can be used too, since the same tool is used for reptiles and aquariums alike. The container in which they need to live, is supposed to be of deep and moistured. Peat moss must be provided, even though the species are not burrowers. The owner is responsible for keeping the moss clean every two weeks. The species don't require water, since they acquire moisture from their prey. The temperature in the container must be at 75‚Äì90 ¬∞F or 24‚Äì32 ¬∞C for the species to survive and reproduce. Reproduction The species are parthenogenetic, and they consist only of females.Photos of only female species The females give birth in 3 months, with the period being as long as 4‚Äì5 months. Various gestation periods are different, and can take maximum from 9‚Äì12 months. The gestation can be shortened if the temperature is warm enough. The brood size is from 2‚Äì16, with an average of 8. Emergency sting procedures The species is venomous, and therefore shouldn't be disturbed. T. stigmurus has a recorded LD50 of 0.575 mg/ kg in mice, which is significant. Study (published 8 August 2013) of the effects of T. stigmurus venom on children in its native Brazil has shed light on the venom's effects.Out of a recorded 1,618 envonomations, 20% of cases were asymptomatic (presumably dry stings, with no venom injected); 66.1% involved only local manifestations; 13.6% had moderate signs of envenoming, and 0.4% were severe. Out of the 1,618 cases, three children, all aged less than five years of age, died, for a mortality rate of 0.2%. Tityus stigmurus is thus significantly toxic, but not to be equated with scorpions of higher toxicity. On the popular 1 - 5 sting-rating scale used for scorpions, T. stigmurus ranks somewhere between levels 3 and 4. However, if the person does get stung by them the person needs to: *Use an ice pack to cool the burn *Go to the hospital *Make sure to be assessed for common severe complications related to scorpion stings, such as acute kidney injury and pancreatitis. *Venom extraction kits were tested and proven to be ineffective in mitigating or preventing envenomation and causes more tissue trauma on the wound area due to the suction of the apparatus.

In Ireland he won the Beresford Stakes as a two-year-old in 1971 and went on to win the Nijinsky Stakes and the Desmond Stakes in 1972. In September 1972 he was sent to England where he won the St. Leger Stakes at Doncaster. At the end of the season he was retired to stand as a stallion in Australia, where he had some success as a sire of winners. Background Boucher was a chestnut horse bred in Kentucky by his owner Ogden Phipps. He was sired by the undefeated Italian champion Ribot out of the mare Glamour. As a descendant of the broodmare La Troienne, Boucher was a member of the Thoroughbred Family 1-x, which has produced numerous important winners including Buckpasser, Easy Goer and Allez France. Phipps sent the colt to be trained in Ireland by Vincent O'Brien at Ballydoyle. Although Boucher was named after the painter Fran√ßois Boucher his name was usually pronounced as \\"Bowtcher\\" (). Racing career=1971: two-year-old season Boucher won two of his three races as a two-year-old in 1971. After winning a maiden race he was moved up in class and won the Group Two Beresford Stakes at the Curragh. He was then sent to England to contest the Group One Observer Gold Cup at Doncaster. He finished fourth behind the English-trained High Top, who went on to win the following season's 2000 Guineas. 1972: three-year-old season Boucher began his three-year-old season by winning the Nijinsky Stakes. He was then sent to England for the Chester Vase, an important trial race for The Derby. He started favourite, but made no impression, finishing last of the six runners behind Ormindo. He was subsequently found to be suffering from a viral infection and was off the course for three months. Boucher returned in August and won a handicap race over ten furlongs at Leopardstown. He then won the Group Three Desmond Stakes at the Curragh, beating the filly Pidget who had won the Irish 1000 Guineas and went on to win the Irish St Leger. In the St Leger at Doncaster, Boucher started at odds of 3/1 against six opponents, with the Irish Derby winner, Steel Pulse, being made the 9/4 favourite. Ridden by Lester Piggott he moved up to challenge for the lead two furlongs from the finish and won after a struggle by half a length from Our Mirage, with The Oaks winner Ginevra four lengths further back in third. The race was run on extremely soft ground and the winning time of 3:28.71 was the slowest recorded at Doncaster in the 20th century. On his only subsequent appearance, Boucher ran in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, a race for which he had reportedly been strongly fancied by Vincent O'Brien. He raced prominently and contested the lead in the straight but was outpaced in the closing stages and finished unplaced behind San San. Assessment Boucher was given a rating of 124 by Timeform in 1972. This was the lowest rating given to a St Leger winner in the organisation's history. Stud career Boucher was sold for A$530,000 to the Australian breeder John Kelly exported to stand as a stallion at the Newhaven Park Stud in New South Wales. He sired several good winners including Lawman (Doncaster Handicap), Been There (Silver Slipper Stakes) and Mr Independent (Carlyon Cup).The last of Boucher's foals were born in 1987.

It received a 1977 Newbery Honor award and the Welsh Tir na n-Og Award. It tells of the American Morgan family who temporarily move to Wales, where Peter Morgan finds a magical harp key that gives him vivid visions of the past. This well-received novel is an unusual time travel story, with its focus on the emotional pain and separation the Morgans experience after the death of their mother and the gradual healing they find through their experiences. Plot summary The novel is about the American Morgan family and their experiences in Wales. The Morgan family originally settled in Wales at the behest of Mrs. Morgan, who wanted to relocate from Boston. Mrs. Morgan passes away before the start of the novel, leaving her family in Wales. The novel opens a year after her death as the older daughter Jen is flying from America to Wales to join her family for Christmas. Mr. Morgan has taken a temporary teaching position at the University of Aberystwyth and with the two younger children is living in a nearby seaside village. Jen is dismayed to find their home cold and uncomfortable, her brother and sister unhappy, and their father ignoring them. She eventually convinces her father to let her remain with the family in Wales instead of finishing high school in America. To supplement the lack of a traditional education, her father gives her challenging reading assignments. Peter Morgan, who dislikes living in Wales, becomes fascinated by a mysterious object that he found by the shore. He finds out that it is a harp-tuning key that once belonged to the Celtic bard Taliesin. The key has a subtle magical power that enables Peter to see visions of Taliesin's life. Soon it is not only Peter who is seeing visions, and the whole family witnesses an ancient battle on Borth Bog, although they do not realize what is happening. A she-wolf is caught in a hunt, despite their being extinct in Wales. John Owen of the National Museum gets wind of the key's existence and tries to obtain it for the museum. However, Peter becomes convinced that the key should instead be returned to Taliesin. At the end of the story, Peter manages to find Taliesin's secret grave and return the key. Setting The principal setting is Borth, a coastal village near Aberystwyth. Other scenes are set in contemporary Aberystwyth and Cardiff and in sixth-century Britain.  Characters  * Jennifer Morgan, a 15-year-old American girl * Peter Morgan, her 12-year-old brother * Becky Morgan, her 10-year-old sister * David Morgan, a university teacher of English, widowed father of Jen, Peter, and Becky. * Mrs. Davies, the Morgans' English-born neighbor and daily help, who runs a bed and breakfast. * Gwilym Davies, her schoolboy son, a keen birdwatcher who becomes friends with the Morgan children. * Rhian Evans, a Welsh schoolfriend of Becky's, who lives on a sheep farm in the hills with her family. * Dr. Gwyn Rhys, Director of Welsh Studies at the University of Aberystwyth, David's friend and colleague. * Dr. John Owen of the National Museum in Cardiff. In the past * Taliesin, a Welsh bard of the sixth century * Aneirin, a bard, Taliesin's companion and guide * Elphin Rheged, Taliesin's pupil, a son of Urien Rheged * Gwyddno Garanhir, king of Ceredigion, Taliesin's patron and friend * Maelgwn Gwynedd, king of Gwynedd Background This Scottish cl√†rsach, now in the Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh, is one of only three surviving medieval Gaelic harps. Bond began A String in the Harp while looking for a job after returning to the United States from a year in graduate school studying librarianship in Aberystwyth. She drew closely on her experiences and reactions to write the book, saying \\"the American family notices and adjusts to the same things I did\\". She did not intend to write a fantasy. \\"I consider myself a realistic kind of person, and it really surprised me in many ways that the first book I should write would be a fantasy.\\" According to Elizabeth Briggs in On the Inside Looking In: Contemporary Anglo-Welsh Fantasy, non-Welsh authors use Welsh mythology in their books to develop a sense of fantasy and unreality. But Bond found using Taliesin's life was a good way to introduce Welsh history into the story. Because he was already associated with the area she was writing about and his presence helped convey a sense of the country's age to her American reading audience, she chose to use him as her link to Wales' past. She needed a talisman to trigger the fantasy sections of the story, and when she read that harp keys are essential for tuning she knew she had found an object she could use in the book. The visions the key brings to Peter and the others tie the various elements of the story together. Taliesin was a British poet, or bard, of the 6th Century. The details of his life are sketchy and come only from his own poetry, so Bond filled in specific elements to suit her story. As mentioned in the book, Bedd Taliesin does mean 'Taliesins' grave', but his actual burial site is unknown. Although later mythology places him in the court of King Arthur, Bond wanted Taliesin to appear as real as possible, to help ground the fantasy sections of the book in reality. Fantasy elements As a time travel fantasy, Deborah O'Keefe in Readers in Wonderland considered A String in the Harp an unusual form of the \\"Junior-Year-Abroad type of fantasy\\" because the children observe Taliesin and his world but never fully enter it. Another element that sets the novel apart from other time-travel books is the strong sense of realism that helps make her time-travel story convincing. A String in the Harp has been compared to Susan Cooper's contemporary fantasy The Dark Is Rising Sequence. Both writers produced novels in the 1970s based on Welsh mythology, including the Mabinogion. Louisa Smith in the International Companion Encyclopedia Of Children's Literature, says Bond and Cooper \\"use the intrusion of the supernatural into everyday life as both threat and challenge\\". Children's Literature also compared the two writers, but felt that Bond's book emphasized family more than Cooper's, and that Bond used her magic as a way of bringing about growth in the Morgan's lives. Themes The Newbery Companion calls A String in the Harp a \\"story of friendship and family problems\\". The difficulties between Peter and his father, and the entire family's attempts to cope with their grief over their mother's death, form the core of the novel. Their problems, and their struggle to accept the changes that entails, form the core of the book. University professor, author and folklore expert C. W. Sullivan said that \\"without the traditional Welsh materials, A String in the Harp would be just another adolescent problem novel\\". In A String in the Harp Jenny is frustrated with her father's attitude toward Peter but she accepts his ineffectual parenting with little protest, and stays in Wales to take care of the house and her family, even though this means she will miss at least one year of high school. Writing in \\"A Guide to Newbery Medal Winners And Honor Books, 1977-1994\\", Judith Kinman calls Jenny's taking over running the house after her mother's death sexist, and says it makes the book difficult to recommend to young readers. She also cites Jenny's belief that she should be able to mediate between her father and brother as an example of stereotyping a girl's role as caregiver. Though Mr. Morgan is a university professor, Peter grumbles constantly about school and the irrelevant facts he feels forced to learn, including Welsh. Jenny is allowed to stay in Wales and miss a year of school though she does do some reading and keeps a journal. Thus, according to Ann Hildebrand in The Dreary Time: The Ethos of School in Award-Winning Fiction for Children, Bond's book reinforces the idea that school is an unpleasant necessity that keeps a child from more enjoyable and meaningful activities. Gladys Hunt, in Read for Your Life, gives two themes for the book. The first speaks of the possibility of magical happenings in the real world. Though Jenny at first refuses to imagine that Peter's talk of visions could be true, other characters are not so certain. Mr. Evans the farmer maintains that there are \\"things as can't be explained\\", despite the skepticism of his family. Later in the story Jenny visits Professor Rhys and tells him about Peter's visions, hoping he will give her a reasonable explanation for them. Instead he shocks her by admitting he believes magical occurrences are possible and superstitions may be rooted in facts, saying \\"the more I learn the less I know... Why should there not be forces we do not understand?\\" The second theme Hunt mentions is that people's lives form patterns, sometimes woven together so that the actions of one may affect another's, even centuries apart, as Peter returning Taliesin's key brings peace to both of them. Critical reception A String in the Harp received a Newbery Honor award for 1977. It also won the 1977 International Reading Association Children's Book Award, was named an American Library Association Notable Book, a Boston Globe-Horn Book Honor Book, and Horn Book Magazine named it a Best Book for 1977. The Welsh National Centre for Children's Literature gave A String in the Harp the Tir na n-Og Award for the best book written in English with \\"an authentic Welsh background\\". Though A String in the Harp received the Tir na n-Og Award in 1977, as of 1995 it still had not been published in Britain. Along with awards A String in the Harp received positive reviews from major publications. Kirkus Reviews praised the descriptions of the Welsh country and weather and the likability of the characters. Kirkus also appreciated that Bond managed to avoid any excesses of the typical Arthurian fantasy, keeping the family's growth and emotional healing as the focus. Elleman reported some reviewers have criticized the length of the book, but feels those who finish it will find it memorable.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. History: Lightships The Lansing Shoals are located at the northern end of a narrow shipping passage that ships are forced to navigate on the Lake Michigan side of the Straits of Mackinac. In the 1890s, iron ore shipments from Escanaba, Michigan increased significantly, putting pressure on the Lighthouse Board to improve the lighting in the area. They responded by moving the lightship LV55 from Simons Reef to Lansing Shoals in mid-1900. LV55 was one of three identical lightvessels authorized by Congress in 1889. These vessels were originally to be moored at Simmons Reef, White Shoals, and Grays Reef. The three vessels, designated LV55, LV56, and LV57, were constructed by Blythe Craig Shipbuilding Company of Toledo, Ohio, and were put in service in late 1891. The removal of LV55 to Lansing Shoals was regarded as only a temporary solution, however. In 1908, the Lighthouse Board requested an appropriation for a permanent structure to be built at the location. The request was not approved, and LV55 stayed on station until 1920, when her hull was found to be unrepairable and she was removed from service. At that time, LV98, a lightvessel built by the Racine-Truscott-Shell Lake Boat Company of Muskegon, Michigan in 1914, was tasked to serve in its place. However, the Great Lakes fleet was operating further and further into the winter season, leaving a substantial shipping time in early spring and late fall where the lightvessel could not be on station due to ice buildup. Thus, replacing the ship with a permanent light station again became a priority. History: Light station In 1926, congress approved expenditure for a permanent station. A site was located, and in 1927 work began on constructing a foundation. On October 6, 1928, the station was lit for the first time and LV98 was removed from duty. The station was manned until the summer of 1976, at which time the original third order Fresnel lens was replaced with an acrylic optic, the station was secured, and an automated system was put in place. The original Fresnel lens is now on display at the Michigan State Historical Museum in Lansing, Michigan.http://www.nps.gov/maritime/lens/lashlens.htm The light is still in use as a navigational aid. Description The Lansing Shoals Light Station sits on a bed of stone, with concrete caissons forming the foundation. Reinforced concrete forms the crib, within which is a basement on a side. The basement is divided into two sections: one for machinery and one for the crew's sleeping quarters. The basement originally had 27 porthole-style windows in diameter, but all windows in the structure were sealed after the light was automated. The ceiling of the basement, above the level of the lake, forms the main deck of the light. A house square and high sits in the center of the deck. This house originally held the kitchen, dining room, and other crew living quarters. In the center of the house sits a three-story square tower, tapering from at the base to at the top. Both house and tower are constructed from sheathed concrete. A circular cast iron lantern sits on top of the tower; it originally held a third order Fresnel lens with a 500 Watt lamp.

Stadsg√•rden (Stadens skeppg√•rd) originally constituted only the western, broader part of the shore, near to a steep cliff face on Fj√§llgatan. The name is credited to have first occurred in 1448, in a text mentioning \\"en tompt vppa sudra malm belegna vidh Stadz garden\\". At least from the early 14th century, so called \\"tran boats\\" or \\"seal boats\\" lay fastened to poles on the water around the area. In the boats, seal fat from the Stockholm archipelago and the Bothnian Sea was cooked, and the resulting whale oil from this smelly contraption was packed in cans and sold further. The boats were left until the start of the 17th century.Kerstin S√∂derlund & Marcus Hjulhammar A certain building, containing stables, was prominent in the area. In Stockholm's privilege letter from 1594, proposals to tear down this building to give place for ship construction docks were mentioned: Greater customs building (Stora Tullhuset) and Old Town in the background, in December 2010. Ship construction on the area was probably started in 1687 when the S√∂dra varvet in Tegelviken was founded. In the Karta √∂fver S:ta Catharina f√∂rsamling from 1674, a long row of narrow lots towards Saltsj√∂n is visible, but no road connecting them. On the map, Tegelvik remains a bay, bearing the name Skjeps-hwarfwet. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the name Skeppsbron, or Nya Skeppsbron, is also mentioned, relating to Skeppsbron in Gamla stan. In an attempt by city architect Johan Eberhard to improve the Stadsg√•rden docks in the end of the 1730s, a long wooden wharf was built. From the wharf, hay, wheat, wood and coal were distributed to be transported across the sea. In wintertime, the wharf was used by many vinterliggarna. Work to replace the wooden wharf by a stone construction proceeded very slowly because of the great depth of water. From 1875 to 1882, a new wooden wharf was built instead, resting on three rows of poles, with a length of 528 metres. Railway tracks were laid down on the wharf and connected with the Sammanbindningsbanan in Stockholm and the Skeppsbro wharf track. A magazine was built in 1883, and from 1888 to 1889 the Lilla Tullhuset was built. During the name revision in 1885, the name for the area between Slussen and Tegelviksplan was established as Stadsg√•rden, having previously (1849) been called Stadsg√•rdhamnen. In the late 19th century, a railway track, Saltsj√∂banan, was built and completed on 1 July 1893. The Stadsg√•rden railway station was in use from 23 December 1893 to 21 December 1936, when it was moved to Slussen. The station building, dating from 1914, was sold to Stockholm's Christian Seaman Care, and the building became known as Sj√∂mansinstitutes hus. Work between 1911 and 1915 replaced the old wooden wharf with a granite-enforced concrete wharf, which was 12 metres longer than the old wharf. At the same time, the sea bed around the wharf was scooped. Stadsg√•rdleden and Stadsg√•rdhamnen The traffic way Stadsg√•rdleden was named in 1986 and replaced a large part of the older traffic way. The traffic way is about 1.3 km long, and the way from S√∂der M√§larstrand passes by S√∂dra J√§rngraven, Saltsj√∂rampen, Franska bukten, Stadsg√•rdhamnen, Katarinabergen and Tegelviksslingan. The major attraction in the west is the Katarina Elevator and in the east, the cliff with F√•f√§ngan on its top. Stadsg√•rdhissen is located halfway between Slussen and Tegelviksplan, and from there, the 638-metre Stadsg√•rdtunneln, located on the Saltsj√∂banan railway track, begins. Today, \\"Stadsg√•rden\\" refers to the 300-metre road part connection √ñstra Slussgatan with Stadsg√•rdleden. Along \\"Stadsg√•rdhamnen\\", the Stockholm city wharves can be found, with terminals for cruise ferries and ferries to Finland, including the Viking Line terminal. Stadsg√•rdhamnen on a summer day in 2007 Stadsg√•rdhamnen during \\"The Tall Ships' Races\\" on 28 July 2007 can give an impression about how the wharf looked like in the 18th century.

Morde began his career as a radio announcer before getting into journalism. In 1940, he was hired to lead an expedition to search for the \\"Lost City of the Monkey God\\" in Honduras. After five months, he claimed to have found the city and brought thousands of artifacts back to the United States to prove it. He promised to return soon for a proper excavation, but never did, nor did he reveal the precise location of his find. Morde spent the later years of his life as a diplomat, then a producer of news films. He took his own life in 1954. In 2013, Christopher S. Stewart wrote a book about Morde and his hunt for a legendary \\"lost city\\" that some have equated with la Ciudad Blanca. Douglas Preston's 2017 book The Lost City of the Monkey God shows that, based on Morde's own expedition journals, Morde never found any ruins and completely fabricated his story of having done so. Early life Descended from whalers, Theodore A. Morde was born in New Bedford, Massachusetts on March 17, 1911. After graduating from New Bedford High School, he toured Europe. Career Morde got a job as a radio announcer for WNBH in New Bedford before taking special classes at Brown University from 1935-36. He then studied with the Hamilton Wright Agency to become a journalist. He later worked at radio stations in Pawtucket, Providence, and San Francisco. As a journalist, he covered both sides of the Spanish Civil War in 1938. In 1942, he was a correspondent stationed with the British Eighth Army in Northern Africa during World War II. Around the same time, he served as general manager of Reader's Digest Near Eastern edition. In 1947, he covered the Arab side of the Palestine War. Explorer In 1940 George Gustav Heye hired Morde to lead an expedition to Honduras for the Museum of the American Indian. Two previous expeditions, performed by R. Stuart Murray, had turned up rumors of a lost city, which according to Murray the locals called the \\"Lost City of the Monkey God.\\" In addition to searching for the city, Morde's expedition sought to study the indigenous people of the region, further explore known archaeological sites, and chart the upper reaches of the Wamp√∫ River. A conceptual drawing of Morde's Lost City of the Monkey God by Virgil Finlay After four months, Morde and his colleague, Laurence C. Brown, emerged from the forest and sent news of a great find. \\"'City of the Monkey God' is believed located: Expedition reports success in Honduras expedition\\" read the headline of the New York Times. When they returned to the states they brought thousands of artifacts to back their claim that they had found the lost city. They described their find as the capital of an agricultural civilization of the Chorotega people. Artifacts found included blades, a flute, sculptured idols, and stone utensils. Morde and Brown also reported seeing evidence of gold, silver, platinum, and oil in the region. According to Morde, flooding prevented formal excavation, but he planned to return in January 1941. Morde went on to write a colorful travelogue of his experiences titled \\"In the Lost City of Ancient America's Monkey God\\" for The American Weekly. \\"I am convinced that we have found the site of the legendary Lost City of the Monkey God\\", he began the travelogue. He described \\"penetrating far into little known Mosquitia Territory\\" and warding off \\"malaria, deadly snakes, vicious insects and jungle beasts\\" before coming upon the ruins. \\"Towering mountains\\" flanked the \\"ideal setting\\" where he discovered a walled city with a monkey god that resembled Hanuman from Hindu culture. The temple of the god was not found, but local Paya guides described what it once looked like in detail allegedly passed down from their ancestors who had seen it. When Morde asked his guides about the Monkey God, they told him a story of a monkey who had stolen three women. In a story, the monkey and the women bred and made half-monkey half- human children. The half-breeds were hunted three at a time for revenge. A similar story was later told to American anthropologist James Taggart by Nahuat speakers. According to the stories Morde was told, the monkey god was once worshipped with human sacrifice by Chorotega people. He also described a \\"Dance of the Dead Monkeys\\", a still practiced \\"perverted memory of that old form of worship\\", according to Morde. In great detail he describes how hunters kill three monkeys apiece and put them in the fire to \\"dance\\" as the heat makes their muscles contract. He describes a second legend, \\"the Sacred Bird of the Chorotegans\\", where a beautiful queen was changed into a Margarita bird by an evil god Wampai. Morde never did return to Honduras, or reveal the precise location of his find. His city has been associated with the legend of la Ciudad Blanca in the Mosquitia region of eastern Honduras. Diplomat Morde also had ties to the OSS, and received a bronze star medal for actions in Ankara, Turkey 1943 as a Lieutenant, junior grade. After World War II, he served as a special adviser to the Egyptian Premier for the US government, and as adviser to the Egyptian Ambassador in Washington, D.C. Later in life, Morde founded Theodore Morde, Inc. to produce news films, and served as the president of Spot News Productions. Personal life Morde was married to Gloria E. Gustafson, a model employed by the John Robert Powers Agency. The couple had two children‚ÄîChristine and Theodore. Morde had a brother and a sister, and was an avid traveler. Death On June 26, 1954, Morde was found hanging from the shower stall of his parents' home in Dartmouth, Massachusetts. His death was ruled a suicide by the medical examiner. Conspiracy theorists later asserted sinister forces were behind his death. Some normally reliable sources written much later report that Morde had been run over by an automobile in London, England \\"shortly\\" after his expedition to Honduras.  Legacy =Jungleland In 2013, journalist Christopher S. Stewart wrote a book titled Jungleland about the legend of la Ciudad Blanca and Morde. He went to Honduras and undertook an expedition with archaeologist Christopher Begley in 2008 where he attempted to retrace Morde's steps using his original field journals. Stewart interviewed Morde's surviving family members and provided an account of his life. In 2015 archeologists discovered a \\"lost city\\" in the region, thought to be associated with the civilization discovered by Morde. At the scientists' urging, the Honduran government dispatched army forces to protect the site from looters.  The Lost City of the Monkey God  In his 2017 book The Lost City of the Monkey God, Douglas Preston states that Morde fabricated all of his claims about finding a lost city. Preston obtained copies of Morde's expedition journals from the National Geographic Society, which had in turn obtained the journals from Morde's family in 2016. The journals, written by Morde and Brown together, show that they never found any ruins, and indeed, they never searched for any in the first place. Their supposed archaeological expedition was actually a cover; the real purpose of the trip was to search for gold along the R√≠o Blanco, nowhere near the reported location of the purported lost city. Their search for gold was a failure, and the men left the jungle after their supplies ran low and a storm destroyed their equipment. The artifacts the two men supposedly brought back from the lost city were acquired near Brewer's Lagoon after their return from the deep jungle. The journals do not confirm whether the story about actually finding the fantastic lost city was pre-planned from the start or improvised after their failure to locate gold, although Preston indicates that he believes it was pre-planned. On June 17, 1940, the last day of the expedition, just before emerging from the jungle, Morde wrote, \\"We are convinced no great civilization ever existed up there. And there are no archaeological discoveries of importance to be made.\\" References * 1911 births 1954 deaths Explorers of Central America American ethnologists ","title":"Theodore Morde"},{"id":"36100557","text":"Township 9 is one of thirteen current townships in Benton County, Arkansas, USA.

Nelson, who did not manage through the 1960s to succeed as a singer, retired after the failure of his 1971 album Yesterday's Wine. The following year, he returned from retirement rejuvenated by the burgeoning music movement of Austin, Texas. In 1973, he formed a new backing band. The new lineup consisted of some of the members of his old road band \\"The Record Men,\\" with the addition of new members. The original lineup included his sister, Bobbie, on the piano; drummer Paul English; harmonicist Mickey Raphael; bassist Bee Spears; and guitarist Jody Payne. The current lineup includes all the members but Jody Payne, who retired in 2008, and Bee Spears, who died in 2011. Billy English joined in 1983 on percussion. Replacing Spears, Kevin Smith joined the band in 2012. The Record Men During the 1960s, while recording as an RCA Records artist, Nelson was backed in the studio by session musicians, while he also had a road band. In 1966, he formed a new lineup for his road band, consisting of Johnny Bush on guitar; Jimmy Day on the steel guitar; Paul English on drums; and David Zettner on bass. The band was originally named \\"The Offenders\\", but after it was rejected by the promoters, the name was changed to \\"The Record Men\\", after Nelson's single \\"Mr. Record Man\\". Zettner left the band in 1968 after he was drafted. He was replaced on the bass by his friend Bee Spears. While playing in the band, Johnny Bush also played as a solo act on the package of the Willie Nelson Show. After Zettner was discharged from the military he returned to the band, and Spears started to play for Bush. Bush left The Record Men to concentrate on his solo act a few months later. After a brief exit of Jimmy Day to play with Ray Price's Cherokee Cowboys, Paul English's older brother, Oliver, joined for nine months playing the steel guitar. In 1969 Jimmy Day and David Zettner returned, while Billy English, Paul English's younger brother, joined to play the drums. By 1971, after nearly a decade with RCA, Nelson had no major success. Meanwhile, his latest album Yesterday's Wine failed to chart and to meet RCA expectations. Although his contract was not over, Nelson decided to retire because of the number of failures he had had. Forming the Family Mickey Raphael He moved to Austin, Texas, where the burgeoning hippie music scene rejuvenated the singer. His popularity in Austin soared as he played his own brand of country music marked by country, folk and jazz influences. In 1972, Nelson's friend Darrell Royal, introduced him harmonicist Mickey Raphael during a jam session. Nelson soon returned to the recording under a new contract with Atlantic Records. His sister Bobbie, who performed on piano in Nelson's band during his childhood throughout the Texas Honky-Tonk circuit, joined the band during the recording of Shotgun Willie. After Nelson's relationship with Jimmy Day became turbulent, due to his habitual drinking, and after he was shot by Paul English during a dispute, Day left shortly after recording Shotgun Willie. Nelson retired the steel guitar from his backing, using Raphael's harmonica to replace the steel guitar on the melody lines. He later also hired Merle Haggard's touring guitarist Jody Payne. The final lineup consisted of Bobbie Nelson (piano), Paul English (drums), Mickey Raphael (harmonica), Bee Spears (bass) and Jody Payne (guitar). The band that became known as the Family, performed together for the first time at the Armadillo World Headquarters in Austin, Texas, where they were acclaimed by the audience. Rex Ludwig played drums with the band from 1976 to 1979, Chris Ethridge played bass from 1978-1982, and Grady Martin played guitar from 1979-1994. In 2012, Kevin Smith joined the band as the bassist after the death of Bee Spears earlier the same year. Smith had already backed Nelson on his 2009 album Willie and the Wheel.

Sixtiers were distinguished by their liberal and anti-totalitarian views, and romanticism that found vivid expressions in music and visual arts. Although most of the Sixtiers believed in Communist ideals, they had come to be strongly disappointed with Stalin's regime and its repression of basic civil liberties. Many of the Sixtiers were intellectuals of roughly two strains: the \\"physicists\\" (those involved in the technical sciences) and the \\"lyricists\\" (writers, theater and film professionals, and otherwise liberal arts representatives). Bard (singer- songwriter) culture, poetry, disillusionment in politics, and love for camping trips to the farther regions of the Soviet Union were some of the common attributes and pastimes of the Sixtiers.

Baron, later Count Nikolaus Esterh√°zy de Gal√°ntha () (Galanta, 8 April 1583Gro√üh√∂flein, 11 September 1645) was the founder of the West-Hungarian noble House of Esterh√°zy which became one of the grandest and most influential aristocratic families of the Kingdom of Hungary. Life Nikolaus's parents were Protestants, and he himself followed them at first, but he subsequently became a Catholic and, along with Cardinal P√°zm√°ny, his most serious rival at court, became a pillar of Catholicism, both religiously and politically. At court, he opposed the two great Protestant champions of the period, Gabriel Bethlen and George I R√°k√≥czi. Matthias II made him a baron (1613), count of Bereg (1617), and lord-lieutenant () of the county of Z√≥lyom and (1618). His political ideal was the consolidation of the House of Habsburg as a means towards freeing Hungary from domination by the Ottoman Empire, and the Habsburg noted him because of his zeal to that end. He himself, on one occasion (1623), defeated the Turks on the banks of the Nyitra. His first marriage with Orsolya Dersffy made him immensely rich and brought him also the lordships of Munk√°cs (today: Mukachevo, Ukraine) and L√°nzs√©r-Lakompak (today: Landsee and Lackenbach in Austria). When he had to hand over Munk√°cs in 1622 to Gabriel Bethlen because of the Peace of Nikolsburg, he was compensated by the Emperor with 2 new lordships, namely Frakn√≥ (today: Forchtenstein, Austria) and Kismarton (today: Eisenstadt, Austria). In 1625 he officiated in the coronation of the Emperor Ferdinand II, who made him Palatine of Hungary, the highest political function in the country.

Life  Count G√ºnther XLI was the eldest son of Count G√ºnther XL of Schwarzburg (1490-1552), who was nicknamed the Rich or G√ºnther with the fat mouth. His mother was Countess Elisabeth (d. 14 May 1572), the daughter of Count Philip of Isenburg-B√ºdingen-Ronneburg. G√ºnther XL had united all the possessions of Schwarzburg, except the Lordship of Leutenberg. After he died on 10 November 1552, his four surviving sons ruled jointly at first, with the younger brothers receiving assistance from their mother. However, in 1571, they divided the county among themselves. G√ºnther XLI began his military career in Vienna as Seneschal of Emperor Charles V. In 1553, he joined the imperial army which made an (ultimately unsuccessful) attempt to reconquer Metz. He then accompanied Philip, the later King Philip II of Spain to London, where Philip would marry Queen Mary I of England. In 1555, G√ºnther XLI stayed in Brussels, where Charles V gave him . He then make a visit to Schwarzburg, and then returned to the imperial army, where he served as a colonel. In 1557, he fought on the victorious side at St. Quentin. At the turn of 1559/1560, G√ºnther travelled to Dresden on behalf of William the Silent, to take the first steps in the process that led to William marrying Anna, the niece of Elector Augustus of Saxony on 24 August 1561. G√ºnther XLI married himself on 17 November 1560. For political reasons, he married William's sister, Catherine of Nassau-Dillenburg. The marriage remained childless. The couple lived in Arnstadt for a while, where G√ºnther used his to build Neideck Castle. Between 1563 and 1565, G√ºnther and his younger brothers John G√ºnther I and Albert VII fought in the army of King Frederick II of Denmark in the Northern Seven Years' War against Sweden. In early 1566, G√ºnther XLI returned to the Netherlands. On 12 March 1566, William the Silent gave a party at the castle of the Counts of Hoogstraten to celebrate his return. However, this was just a pretext. William wanted to discuss his strategy towards Margaret of Parma, who was Governor General of the Netherlands, with the other guests, the Counts of Egmont, Horn, Bergen, Meghen and Montigny. A few weeks later, G√ºnther fought in Hungary in the service of Emperor Maximilian II against the Turks. During this campaign, G√ºnther acquired his nickname \\"the Quarrelsome\\". He was not respected by the Emperor. He often quarreled with the Emperor and did not obey orders. He protested against the Emperor's plan to besiege Esztergom. Maximilian wrote angrily to Vienna: Count G√ºnther, does nothing but swagger. He prevents more than he achieves. His survey stated that I have 1500 horses here, but after I used them once, I see no more than 1000. I will probably think three times before I use this colonel again. Nevertheless, the Emperor found new r√¥les for G√ºnther. G√ºnther was appointed to the Aulic Council and entrusted with diplomatic duties. In 1567, he worked in the service of Elector August of Saxony, on behalf of the Emperor. He participated in the siege of Gotha, which was necessary to arrest the deposed Duke John Frederick II of Saxe-Coburg-Eisenach, who had been banned for failure to deliver Wilhelm von Grumbach at the Emperor's demand. After Gotha surrendered, G√ºnther arrested John Frederick II and brought him to Vienna. From 1568 to 1573, G√ºnther advised the Duke of Alba, the Spanish Governor General in the Netherlands. He then spent some time in Schwarzburg. In 1582, Emperor Rudolph II sent G√ºnther to the Southern Netherlands again, where he advised Governor General Archduke Matthias as Privy Councillor. G√ºnther XLI died on 23 May 1583 in Antwerp. His body was transported from Antwerp to Delft, from there by boat to Emden and from there to Sondershausen, where he was buried. As G√ºnther XLI was childless, his younger brothers divided the County of Schwarzburg again after his death. John G√ºnther I (1532-1586) received Arnstadt and Sondershausen and founded the Schwarzburg-Sondershausen line. Albrecht VII (1537-1605) received Rudolstadt and founded the Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt line. William I (1534-1597) received Frankenhausen. Despite marrying twice, William I died childless in 1597 and his share of the County fell to Albrecht VII.

Life Some 19th-century historiographical works ‚Äì including N√°ndor Knauz's Monumenta ecclesiae Strigoniensis ‚Äì incorrectly referred to him as archbishop of Esztergom. Chronologically, Desiderius is first mentioned by the 14th-century Illuminated Chronicle. According to its narration, \\"bishop Desiderius\\" (without mentioning his specific see) mediated the peace negotiations, when Solomon, King of Hungary and his rebellious cousins, dukes G√©za, Ladislaus and Lampert reached an agreement, which was signed in Gy≈ër on 20 January 1064. Despite his being styled as bishop by the chronicle, the majority of the historians consider he already served as archbishop of Kalocsa by then, as the transfer of bishops from one diocese to another was a forbidden procedure in the 11th century. He is identical with that \\"archbishop Ders\\" whose name is mentioned by the founding charter of the Abbey of Sz√°zd (today Sazdice, Slovakia) around 1067 (in medieval Hungary, the given name Ders was the Hungarian name variation of Desiderius). When comes Peter, founder of the monastery, requested exemption from the tax payments (tithe), both King Solomon and Desiderius approved it (despite the fact that the abbey laid in the territory of the Diocese of Eger, a subordinate to Esztergom). Desiderius is next referred to as archbishop in the founding charter of the Benedictine Abbey of Garamszentbenedek (today Hronsk√Ω Be≈àadik, Slovakia) in 1075, alongside Nehemiah, Archbishop of Esztergom. The Illuminated Chronicle refers to him simply as archbishop Desiderius, and narrates that King G√©za celebrated Christmas at Szeksz√°rd Abbey in 1076. Accordingly, the \\"King prostrated himself with tears before the Archbishop [Desiderius] and the other ecclesiastical personages and prelates. He said that he had sinned because he had possessed himself of the kingdom of a lawfully crowned king\\". Based on this chapter, N√°ndor Knauz considered that Desiderius was a different prelate and he could be only archbishop of Esztergom, as there were no known \\"archbishops\\" of Kalocsa when he wrote his monograph about the history of the Archdiocese of Esztergom. However it is known that Nehemiah held that dignity from around 1075 to at least 1077. Historian L√°szl√≥ Koszta argued the above- mentioned chapters of the Illuminated Chronicle were written during the reign of Coloman, King of Hungary. Around that time Lawrence functioned as archbishop of Esztergom. Since his episcopate, tensions appear to have emerged between the sees Esztergom and Kalocsa, which affected the contemporary chronicles too. For instance, that rivalry also appeared in the coeval Life of King Stephen of Hungary, compiled by Hartvik, Bishop of Gy≈ër (thus a subordinate to Lawrence), when it derived the title of the superior of Kalocsa from Esztergom, emphasizing its subsidiarity. Lawrence refused to recognize the Archdiocese of Kalocsa as an equal see in the ecclesiastical hierarchy. According to a non-authentic charter of 1093, Desiderius, \\"bishop\\" of Kalocsa, was involved in a border dispute with Stephen, Bishop of P√©cs. In this year, according to the charter, King Ladislaus I, along with prelates of the kingdom, determined the borders between the Archdiocese of Kalocsa and the Diocese of P√©cs. The charter also relates that the monarch took into account both the testimony of Desiderius and the deed of foundation of the bishopric of P√©cs (dated 1009). The forgery was compiled, among others, by the usage of an authentic document from 1090. It is presumable that Desiderius still held the dignity during that time.
