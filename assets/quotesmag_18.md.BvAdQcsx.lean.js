Vision behind this concept is to assist the policy makers, donors and socio-economic planner for rural electrification worldwide, with special focus on Asian and African countries. Smart villages concept is engaged in efforts to combat the real barriers to energy access in villages, particularly in developing countries with technological, financial and educational methodology. Since 20th Century Electricity has become a vital part of our lives, though we can survive without electricity but cannot progress and enjoy the benefits of science. World's large oil companies have predicted that by 2050, one third of the energy will need to come from Solar, Wind and other renewable resources, therefore adoption of renewable resource in place of fossil fuel is the best approach that can be developed through off-grid systems or communities. Off-grid systems and off-grid communities The term ‚ÄúOff-grid‚Äù itself is very broad and simply refers to \\"not using or depending on electricity provided through main or national grids and generated by main power infrastructures. The term is also used to describe a particular lifestyle which is embodied by autonomous structures. Off-grid systems have a semi or autonomous capability to satisfy electricity demand through local power generation. The term off-grid systems cover both mini-grids for serving multiple users and stand-alone systems for individual appliance or users. In spite witnessing use of fossil fuel for power generation by mini or individual off-grid system, it is broadly defined that off-grid systems are actually based on renewable energy resources. The terms \\"micro-grid, nano-grid and pico-grid are used to differentiate different kinds of mini-grids with size thresholds under off-grid approach. Access to un-interrupted and low cost electricity for socio-economic development is an important requirement. There is a universal demand of grid-based and off-grid solutions to ensure access to electricity all over the world, without off-grid approach increasing demand and decreasing supply cannot be stabilized for the mankind on this planet. About 80% of world's population live in rural areas and majority of these people do not have access to electricity. Due to lack of employment people from rural areas migrate to urban areas where they find employment opportunities much easily because of industrial infrastructure established primarily on availability of electricity. International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) power generation projects based on renewable energy technology at low cost are the attractive option for off-grid electrification in most of the rural areas of Asian countries. Its work will satisfy the rural electricity demand and provide employment opportunities to minimize the rapid urbanization. Off-grid communities in Asia According to a publication written for the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in 2012, Asia has the largest off-grid population in the world, with 55% of the global off-grid population, and 798 million people having no access to electricity. As per estimates about 700 million or 90% were located in rural Asia. However, research studies reveal that South Asian and Sub-Saharan African countries have been unable to expand their electrification rate. Whereas electrification progress in regions such as Latin America and East Asia (China) indicates a rapid growth. Central Asian countries are blessed with sufficient resources and export their extra electricity to neighboring countries. Smart village/off-grid communities Electrification is highly desired by all rural communities. Different international, national and local organizations use different indicators for measuring and reporting mini-grids or stand-alone systems. South Asian countries have been focusing on off-grid electrification of current trend for Rural Electrification (RE) at regional level. India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal have shown good results for RE through off- grid communities. Eastern Asia/East Asia About 38% of the population of Asia and 22% in the world, live in East Asia. Public confidence in safety of nuclear power was greatly damaged by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, consequently Off-grid concept was applied more conveniently in Japan. Alternative energy technologies have become standard in newly constructed homes. Sekisui House Ltd, a famous Japanese house building firm pointed out that 80% of single-family homes were constructed with alternative energy technology such as solar panels and fuel cells. Reflecting the nation's mood, Executive Director of Sekisui Company states that \\"If you‚Äôre going to use electricity, you might as well make it yourself\\". In June, 2015 Smart Villages (New thinking for off-grid communities worldwide) has conducted a workshop in Seoul to familiarize the people of South Korea about the fast evolving technology moving towards off-grid communities and its support for bright ideas and entrepreneurial efforts in the field of rural energy access. Wind farm in Xinjiang, China According to IRENA report China in 2013, besides wind farms, had roughly 60,000 diesel and hydro mini-grid systems, most of them connected to the centralized grid. It has further installed 118 GW of solar Photovoltaics systems, of which 500 MW was installed in off-grid systems. Acknowledging Solar as green technology, Malaysia has been encouraging solar power for rural electrification and reaffirmed its support of research into off-grid electricity through alternate energy. Malaysian Government also considering potential of smart villages and each village would differ according to the needs of its population. People of Indonesia living in rural areas have been facing low electrification and using fossil fuel for power supply. Additionally many remote communities still lack access to any power at all with little expectation of being supplied on-grid power by the state-owned electricity company (PLN). In the recent past Indonesian government has initiated a properly developed, constructed and sustainable community-owned renewable energy plan to raise the quality of life in rural communities, and under this project plants should be owned, managed and maintained by the rural communities. In 2013 EnDev Indonesia was awarded first prize in the category ‚ÄúCommunity-based Off-grid‚Äù, with its project on micro-hydro power in Lembah Derita, Sumatra Barat. With more than 2,000 inhabited islands, it is difficult in Philippines to extend electrical grid to communities in remote areas. In a documentary presentation, CEO of Hybrid Social Solutions Inc. indicated distribution of solar products that have been delivered to poor communities across the Philippines with a future plan of building an ecosystem to support standalone solar energy devices for use by the rural communities. They have also considered it essential to ensure the sustainability and future growth in remote areas with community based solar projects. has been focusing on modern technologies for overcoming its chronic energy shortage. Utilization of alternative energy sources in place of fossil fuel consumption is being considered to satisfy the socio-economic requirements of its people Western Asia/West Asia and Middle East Geographical marking in the Western Asia consists of 19 countries/territorial states. 5 countries of Asia from this region hold strong financial stability and resources for social development. In this region three countries, According to population demography Turkey, Iraq and Yemen stand at 10th, 13th and 20th position respectively. With a substantial potential for the renewable energy resources, Turkey holds seventh position in the world (and first in Europe) in terms of geothermal energy. It has also planned to further increase its hydro, wind and solar energy resources. Turkey envisages producing 30% of its electricity need from the renewable by 2023. Ten years after the war, the power supply was short of demand. But in April, 2013 Oil Ministry of Iraq highlighted its plan stating that: \\"By the end of 2013, the crisis will be over for households with supply of electricity around the clock across the country. By the end of 2014, Iraq would have met industrial demand as well‚Äù. However, political instability and role of terrorism by the terrorists in Iraq reliable and neutral assessment is still a hard job. Prior to Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen in Yemen, energy and power supply scenario reveals that 93% Yemenis rural population was using gas canisters as their primary source of fuel. They also spent 55% of their income on food, water and energy. Power supply, where available, comes from government-run plants, the majority of which run on diesel. New capacity additions were slow with poor transmission network Northern Asia Covers largest part of Asia with a 17,098,242 km2 area in the Northern sub-region of Asia. Russia is the world's fourth largest electricity producer after the United States, China, and Japan. Russia exports electricity to countries e.g. Latvia, Lithuania, Poland etc. However, import and export reversal has also been reported due to cost of production. South Asia With its insufficient power supply infrastructure covers its electricity demand through import from electricity-exporting countries i.e. Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Iran, these countries mostly sell their surplus electricity to Afghanistan. Above 4 billion US dollars have so far been disbursed to build power supply infrastructure in Afghanistan but deficiencies not only to its rural/remotes areas but country's capital needs more considerable help from developed countries for supply of electrification to whole Afghanistan One of the largest solar power project funded at a cost $18 by the government of New Zealand has started functioning for supply of energy to 2,500 households, businesses and government buildings in central Bamyan Province of Afghanistan. According to a World Bank document, about 62% of Bangladesh's population had access to electricity in 2013, indicating 90% and 43% wide disparity between urban and rural areas. Bangladesh while standing at 134th out of 144 countries on the quality of electricity supply, Renewable Energy for Rural Economic Development (RERED) Project sought to raise levels of social development and economic growth by increasing access to electricity in rural areas. Under REFED notable contribution to social and economic outcomes in rural areas by extending access to electricity through off-grid Solar Home Systems (SHS), has been witnessed and noted with significant increase in Household appliances. The World Bank report envisaged that Off-grid systems can accelerate the benefits of ‚Äúlighting‚Äù in a cost-effective manner, to populations that face uncertain waiting periods for grid-based electricity, or are unlikely to obtain grid-based electricity due to remote or inaccessible locations. Report also focus the role of off-grid communities based on public-private partnership model for off-grid electricity services to the deprived population of Bangladesh. With mini-grids and off-grid applications, India is a leading country. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM) is its main policy initiative to promote solar energy, including off-grid power development. International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the World Bank collaborate with various stakeholders for global off-grid lighting market for reliable electricity to people who have no access to national grids. A neutral, independent, not for profit association called Global Off-Grid Lighting Association (GOGLA) was conceived out of a joint World Bank/IFC Lighting Africa and private sector effort in 2012. India is the first Asian lighting programs for IFC. Lighting Asia/India program was planned to enable access of two million rural Indians to off-grid lighting solutions by 2015. The program is designed with a series of interventions to alter market behavior by removing specific barriers, for example, the market spoilage created by poor products, lack of information on quality products and on distribution channels, lack of financing for companies and consumers, lack of awareness that quality solar appliances are affordable and viable. Solar cells India's first smart village has been developed by Eco Needs Foundation at Dhanora village of Rajasthan. The concept is prepared by Prof. Priyanand Agale, Dr. Satyapal Singh Meena an officer of Indian Revenue Service (IRS)http://epaper.bhaskar.com/detail/1202310/52621824785/0/map/tabs-1/05-26-2017/14/6/image/ and Mr. Attdeep Agale. This concept consists of five elements Retrofitting, Redevelopment, Greenfield, e-Pan and Livelihood. Under the project of smart village the Foundation is adopting villages and putting efforts for sustainable development by providing basic amenities like sanitation, safe drinking water, internal road, tree plantation, water conservation. The Foundation is also working for inculcating moral values in the society and for improving the standard of living of the villagers. The Foundation has developed Village Dhanora, Teh. Bari, District Dholpur, one of the remotely situated village of Rajasthan as India's First Smart Village. The village is situated 30 km away from Dholpur district headquarter and 248 km from Jaipur city, Capital of Rajasthan State of India. The population of the village was nearly about 2000 having no sanitation facility, potable water facility, which were adversely causing the health of the villagers. The internal roads are also not there and it causes great hardship to the people especially in rainy season. Owing to unawareness and non-availability of sanitation facility and toilets the people of the village use to go open for defecation. There are other problems also which villagers were facing such as Fluoride concentration in drinking water, No water conservation System, Encroachment on the roads, Electrical power fluctuation No outcome base education, Unemployment and poverty. ProF. Priyanand Agale Founder, president of Foundation and Dr. Satyapal Singh Meena officer of the Indian Revenue service has converted this village as India's first Smart Village and now Dhanora has become a role model of Rural Development. Following are the major success achieved within a short span of two years of the project and project is still underway: #Construction of 822 toilets in the Panchayat area with the help of district administration and public participation accordingly, the Dhanora Gram Panchayat has been declared as the first ‚ÄúOpen Defecation Free‚Äù (ODF) Panchayat by District Administration. #Village Dhanora become India's first village having sewerage line with treatment plant. The Foundation has laid down nearly 2 km long sewerage line of diameter 450 mm in the village. Each of the toilets of Dhanora village have been connected to sewerage line with inspection chambers. #Construction of nearly 2 km long cement concrete internal roads constructed with 3.5 m to 4.5 m width with high quality. #Construction of eight Percolation tank connecting with nearly 2.5 km artificial channel of 10 feet in width and 10 feet in depth for water conservation and ground water recharge with public participation and with the help of government having groundwater recharge capacity of 97.49 Million liters in one time recharge, which will provide irrigation facility to farms of the village and nearby villages resulting into economic growth of farmers. #The work of the removal of encroachments and road widening has been completed without using any police force. Now the whole village is having motorable road in the village. #Construction of nearly 2 km approach road at Dhodekapura village of the Dhanora Panchayat, which was not done in last 65 years. #The police Administration is going to declare the village as ‚ÄúAPRADH MUKKTA GAON‚Äù (Crime Free Village), no case or FIR in Police Station. #village Dhanora has been converted into an Art gallery. The paintings in the village are spreading social awareness among villagers #The foundation stone for community centre and information centre has been laid down, work under progress. Work of solar street light, skill development centre, library, meditation centre, sport complex, Wi-Fi facility, and community toilet will be taken up in due course of time and as per availability of funds. President of Maldives has already launched an initiative to make the Maldives a solar power stronghold to provide rooftop solar panels in the rural and remote areas of the country. Under this project together with a plan to achieve carbon neutral Maldives by 2020, first solar energy panels was installed in one of the school in Villimale district of Male that accompanied the inauguration of the project. However, Maldives needs more concentration over electrification demand of its people especially in rural and remote areas. Hydro power and solar resources are sufficient enough to satisfy the electricity demand of the Nepal. However, most of the country's current energy needs are met with inefficiently used biomass, including firewood (75%), agricultural residues (4%) and animal waste (6%). The rest is met by commercial sources, including petroleum, coal and electricity. Only about 12 percent of the country's population uses electricity derived from water, wind or sun.In Nepal above 50% households mostly in urban or semi-urban areas are connected to the national grid. Its 80% population is rural. Government of Nepal has launched National Rural and Renewable Energy Program in 2012 with subsidize strategy in an attempt to electrify long-deprived areas. Per Nepal Living Standard Survey 2011 estimates 96% urban 63% rural population has access to electricity. With a total capacity of 107 kW, Nepal's first mini-grid of its kind was set up in 2012 connecting the micro-hydro plants in Rangkhani, Paiyuthanthap, Sarkuwa and Damek. Besides UNDP is encouraging to put the community at the center of the planning, installing, and operating processes of micro-hydro plants. Jhimpir Wind Farm Geographically is located to a place where exploitation of solar energy is most conducive, as it is 6th country in the world in terms of solar irradiance where sunshine availability is 8 to 10 hours per day in its most parts. Mini wind farming projects (1-50 kWatts) along with small solar farms scattered over remote inaccessible areas. Use of solar energy in rural villages of Pakistan with solar panels is growing on off-grid concept with increasing community systems. The Aga Khan Rural Support Programme and the Sarhad Rural Support Programme (through Programme for Economic Advancement and Community Empowerment) have been encouraging village organizations to promote and establish community based micro hydro power projects across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit‚ÄìBaltistan, Federally Administered Tribal Areas and Azad Jammu and Kashmir districts and villages. Both Rural Support Programmes have received the Ashden Award in this regard. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Government has also decided to increase the number of micro hydropower generation projects to 1000, with total power generation capacity of 100 megawatts (MW). There are several barriers that are keepng Pakistan from nationwide off grid electrification, in spite of enough wind, water and sun to poweroff grid communities in Pakistan but the rate of conversion from no energy to alternative energy remains slow. As per World Bank Study, almost 44% of Pakistani households have no access to grid based electricity. 80% of this deprived population resides in remote and rural areas.900MW Lakvijaya Power Station Off-grid electrification schemes are still operating in Sri Lanka in spite 89% systematic grid expansion projects carried out by the Sri Lankan government to national grid. Most of the Village Hydro Schemes (VHS) in Sri Lanka are aided by RERED project funded by World Bank and Global Environment Facility (GEF) these initiatives have established 100-150 Village Hydro Schemes in the country with capacities ranging from 3-50 kW. However, off-grid generation is a diminishing component on the supply side. This is a result of the fast expanding national grid, which now serves more than 90% of all homes. Awareness competitions in India and Pakistan Access to reliable and uninterrupted electricity is a chronic demand in villages all over the world. The best solution for overcoming this problem is utilization of alternative energy with modern advancement with implementation of off-grid system. India In India competition for all enthusiastic entrepreneurs, individuals and organizations running energy access programmes and businesses in rural villages in India has also been launched and is about to close in November-2015. The participants were asked to highlight close sustainable examples where off-grid system is being practiced providing a platform for \\"energy entrepreneurs\\" to discuss the ways for achieving off-grid systems. This competition has also good rewards for successful winners i.e. Cash Prize of I million Indian Rupees, a trip to world Sustainable Development Forum to showcase their business on the main stage, etc. Pakistan Pie chart of survey conducted by a female student of Aga Khan Higher Secondary School. In Pakistan the Agha Khan University Examination Board in October-2015 launched a \\"Poster Competition\\" with the title \\"when ideas flow villages grow\\" as an initiative to introduce the idea of Smart Villages among young students and to evaluate best measures for its implementation.The most outstanding poster presentation from across the country will get a chance to visit the University of Cambridge, UK, besides other good prizes. A female student of Aga Khan Higher Secondary School, one of the participant of the competition conducted the survey from her home place to villagers in remote areas by making connections with them through social media and cellular phones. According to her survey 50% of the people were found not satisfied with the rural electrification rate of PEPCO and other power distribution companies. They also believe that off grid system is now a need for the villages of Pakistan. Majority of the people were in favor of installing solar panels and wind turbines for energy generation in remote areas of Pakistan to boost up the development in energy sector of the country.

It is both the southernmost and most developed part of the watershed of Tunkhannock Creek. There is also a former Superfund site in the creek's watershed. Several historic sites are in the watershed, and a bridge on the Historic American Engineering Record crosses the creek. The watershed of Ackerly Creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery and is inhabited by some trout, as of the 1990s. Numerous recreational sites, both public and private, exist within the creek's watershed. Course Ackerly Creek at the Ackerly Creek Bridge Ackerly Creek begins in an unnamed lake in South Abington Township. It flows southwest for a few tenths of a mile before turning northwest for several tenths of a mile and entering Waverly Township. It then turns west-southwest for more than a mile, passing near the census- designated place of Waverly and crossing Pennsylvania Route 407. The creek then briefly turns west-northwest before turning west-southwest again, crossing a railroad, and entering Glenburn Township and the census-designated place of Glenburn. At this point, it turns north for a few tenths of a mile before turning west across US Route 11 and entering Glenburn Pond. From the northern end of Glenburn Pond, Ackerly Creek flows north-northwest alongside US Route 11 for a few miles, passing through Dalton and entering La Plume Township. There, the creek turns west for a short distance before turning northwest for several tenths of a mile. It then turns west for a few tenths of a mile before turning south and then west again. At this point, it reaches its confluence with South Branch Tunkhannock Creek. Ackerly Creek joins South Branch Tunkhannock Creek upstream of its mouth. Tributaries Ackerly Creek has no named tributaries. However, it does have a number of unnamed tributaries joining from both sides, including UNT 28833, UTN 28835, UNT28836, and UNT28840. One major branch of the creek begins near Florey's wetlands and flows from Gravel Pond to Glenburn Pond. Hydrology Ackerly Creek is not designated as an impaired waterbody. However, its tributary UNT 28835 is impaired. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, the watershed of Ackerly Creek is the most \\"stressed\\" watershed in the Tunkhannock Creek drainage basin. In the 1970s, Ackerly Creek was found to be in good condition. However, there were very low flows at its headwaters. Some sites in the watershed of Ackerly Creek experience problematic concentrations of ammonia, phosphates, and nitrates. Ackerly Creek is an intermittent stream. The creek's watershed is the only watershed in the Tunkhannock Creek drainage basin to have significant urban and suburban water quality impacts. There are stormwater problems in the watershed. At the border between Dalton and La Plume Township, the peak annual discharge of Ackerly Creek has a 10 percent chance of reaching and a 2 percent chance of reaching . It has a 1 percent chance of reaching and a 0.2 percent chance of reaching . At the border between Dalton and Glenburn Township, the peak annual discharge of the creek has a 10 percent chance of reaching and a 2 percent chance of reaching . It has a 1 percent chance of reaching and a 0.2 percent chance of reaching . The peak annual discharge of the creek has a 1 percent chance of reaching above Glenburn Pond. Keystone College has a hydrogeology laboratory on Ackerly Creek. Geography and geology The elevation of the mouth of Ackerly Creek is between above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is between above sea level. In one reach, Ackerly Creek flows through a hollowa shallow valley known as Rabbit Hollow. The creek was historically dammed to create a pond there, but there is no longer a pond at that location. In a reach where Ackerly Creek flows alongside US Route 6 and US Route 11, it has been managed and straightened. This contributes significantly to streambank erosion on the creek. There are roughly a dozen sites with unstable stream bank, and there are several bridge crossings of the creek. There is relatively little garbage along the creek. Although most of the watershed of Ackerly Creek has relatively little impervious cover, an area in the watershed's southernmost reach has approximately 40 percent impervious cover. The creek has a relatively broad and developed floodplain in Dalton. At least one railroad bridge crosses the creek. Watershed The watershed of Ackerly Creek has an area of approximately . Ackerly Creek flows through the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Dalton. The creek's watershed is the southernmost part of the Tunkhannock Creek drainage basin. Municipalities in the creek's watershed include La Plume Township, North Abington Township, Dalton, Waverly Township, South Abington Township, Scott Township, Glenburn Township, West Abington Township, Clarks Summit, and Clarks Green. At the border between Dalton and La Plume Township, Ackerly Creek drains an area of . At the border between Glenburn Pond and Dalton, the creek drains an area of . Above Glenburn Pond, its watershed has an area of . The highest population density and levels of development in the watershed of Tunkhannock Creek are found in the watershed of Ackerly Creek. While the area was once rural, it is now becoming more suburban, with residential land use being common. However, both rural and heavily developed land occur in the creek's watershed. A former Superfund site, known as Precision Plating is in the watershed. The physical condition of the creek's watershed has been described as \\"fair, bordering on good\\". There is a swamp at the headwaters of Ackerly Creek. History and recreation Ackerly Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1168043. The area in the vicinity of Ackerly Creek was historically a haven for escaped slaves. There are several historic sites in the creek's watershed, including the Abington Baptist Church, the Madison Academy, the Waverly Community House, Keystone College, the Northern Electric Street Railway Line, and the Ackerly Fairgrounds. The Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad historically passed through the valley of the creek. A bridge known as the Ackerly Creek Bridge was built in 1904 over Ackerly Creek. The bridge was listed in the Historic American Engineering Record. A concrete box beam or girders bridge carrying State Route 4010 over Ackerly Creek was built in 2006 and is long. A concrete arch bridge carrying Maple Street over the creek in Dalton was built in 2008 and is long. A triple-barrel culvert carries the creek under US Route 6. Between 1972 and 1993, a company had a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit to discharge industrial waste in a swamp at the headwaters of Ackerly Creek. The Land and Water Committee of the Countryside Conservancy began a formal study of the watershed of Ackerly Creek in 1999. In 2007, the Glenburn Pond Dam on the creek was slated for removal. Such a project would take several years and would restore of wetlands and riparian buffers. Keystone College once received a $31,430 Growing Greener grant for riparian buffer restoration on the creek. Biology The main stem of Ackerly Creek is designated as a Trout Stocked Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. However, its unnamed tributaries are designated as Coldwater Fisheries and Migratory Fisheries. As of the 1990s, there is a small trout population in the creek. A total of fourteen salamander species, thirteen snake species, ten species of frogs and toads, and four turtle species. In Rabbit Hollow, through which Ackerly Creek flows, there are numerous bird species, including Louisiana waterthrush, Cooper's hawk, wood thrush, swamp sparrow, pileated woodpecker, belted kingfisher, red-winged blackbird, and gray catbird. Mammals in the hollow include rabbits, woodchucks, chipmunks, squirrels, and white-tailed deer. In some reaches, the riparian buffer of Ackerly Creek is less than thick on one side, while in other reaches, it is more than thick on one side. Invasive species line Ackerly Creek for much of its length. Numerous plant species, including trees, shrubs, and wildflowers, inhabit various parts of Rabbit Hollow. Recreation Numerous recreational sites, both private and public, exist within the watershed of Ackerly Creek. Major recreational sites in the watershed include the Ackerly Playing Fields, the Rabbit Hollow Sanctuary for passive recreation and nature observing, the Dalton Streamside Park, the private Glen Oaks Country Club, and Glenburn Pond. The Rabbit Hollow preserve was donated to the Pennsylvania Chapter of The Nature Conservancy in 1975 and was designated as a preserve in 1977, and came to be owned by Abington Township. A walking trail known as The Trolley Trail is also in the watershed of Ackerly Creek, on the former Northern Electric Trolley Line.

Low-voltage feeders distributing power to households are placed below the transformer A low- voltage network or secondary network is a part of electric power distribution which carries electric energy from distribution transformers to electricity meters of end customers. Secondary networks are operated at a low voltage level, which is typically equal to the mains voltage of electric appliances. Most modern secondary networks are operated at AC rated voltage of 100‚Äì127 or 220‚Äì240 volts, at the frequency of 50 or 60 hertz (see mains electricity by country). Operating voltage, required number of phases (three-phase or single- phase) and required reliability dictate topology and configuration of the network. The simplest form are radial service drop lines from the transformer to the customer premises. Low-voltage radial feeders supply multiple customers. For increased reliability, so-called spot networks and grid networks provide supply of customers from multiple distribution transformers and supply paths. Electric wiring can be realized by overhead power lines, aerial or underground power cables, or their mixture. Overview A house cable connection cabinet equipped with a meter, a time switch and a circuit breaker Electric power distribution systems are designed to serve their customers with reliable and high-quality power. The most common distribution system consists of simple radial circuits (feeders) that can be overhead, underground, or a combination. From the distribution substation, feeders carry the power to the end customers, forming the medium-voltage or primary network, operated at a medium voltage level, typically 5‚Äì35 kV. Feeders range in length from a few kilometers to several tens of kilometers. As they must supply all customers in the designated distribution area, they often curve and branch along the assigned corridors. A substation typically supplies 3‚Äì30 feeders. Distribution transformers or secondary transformers, placed along feeders, convert the voltage from the medium to a low voltage level, suitable for direct consumption by end customers (mains voltage). Typically, a rural primary feeder supplies up to 50 distribution transformers, spread over a wide region, but the figure significantly varies depending on configuration. They are sited on pole tops, cellars or designated small plots. From these transformers, low-voltage or secondary network branches off to the customer connections at customer premises, equipped with electricity meters. Design considerations Most of differences in the layout and design of low-voltage networks are dictated by the mains voltage rating. In Europe and most of the world 220‚Äì240 V is the dominant choice, while in North America 120 V is the standard. ANSI standard C84.1 recommends a +5%, ‚àí2.5% tolerance for the voltage range at a service point. North American LV networks feature much shorter secondary connections, up to , while in European design they can reach up to . North American distribution transformers must be therefore placed much closer to consumers, and are smaller (25‚Äì50 kVA), while European ones can cover larger areas and thus have higher ratings (300‚Äì1000 kVA); only the remote rural areas in European design are served by single-phase transformers. As the low-voltage distribute the electric power to the widest class of end users, another main design concern is safety of consumers who use the electric appliances and their protection against electric shocks. An earthing system, in combination with protective devices such as fuses and residual current devices, must ultimately ensure that a person must not come into touch with a metallic object whose potential relative to the person's potential (which is, in turn, equal to the ground potential unless insulating mats are used) exceeds a \\"safe\\" threshold, typically set at about 50 V. Topology=Radial networks Typical layouts of radial low-voltage networks Radial operation is the most widespread and most economic design of both MV and LV networks. It provides a sufficiently high degree of reliability and service continuity for most customers. In American (120 V) systems, the customers are commonly supplied directly from the distribution transformers via relatively short service drop lines, in star-like topology. In 240 V systems, the customers are served by several low-voltage feeders, realized by overhead power lines, aerial or underground power cables, or their mixture; in an overhead network, service drops are drawn from pole tops to roof connections. In a cable network, all necessary connections and protection devices are typically placed in pad-mounted cabinets or, occasionally, manholes (buried T-joint connections are prone to failures). Low-voltage side switching cabinet of a European MV/LV substation. Four LV cable feeders equipped with circuit breakers featured. Power-system protection in radial networks is simple to design and implement, since short-circuit currents have only one possible path that needs to be interrupted. Fuses are most commonly used for both short- circuit and overload protection, while low-voltage circuit breakers may be used in special circumstances. Spot networks Layout of a spot low- voltage network Spot networks are used when increased reliability of supply is required for important customers. The low-voltage network is supplied from two or more distribution transformers at a single site, each fed from a different MV feeder (which may originate from the same or different substations). The transformers are connected together with a bus or a cable on secondary side, termed paralleling bus or collector bus. The paralleling bus typically does not have connecting cables (reaches) to other network units, in which case such networks are termed isolating spot networks; when they have, they are referred to as spot networks with reach. In some cases, fast-acting secondary bus tie breakers may be applied between bus sections to isolate faults in the secondary switchgear and limit loss of service. Spot systems are commonly applied in high load-density areas such as business districts, large hospitals, small industry and important facilities such as water supply systems. In normal operation, the energy supply is provided by both primary feeders in parallel. In case of an outage of either primary feeder, network protector device at the corresponding spot transformer secondary automatically opens; the remaining transformers continue to provide supply through their respective primary feeders. Only in cases when the short circuit is located at the paralleling bus, or a total loss of primary supply occurs, the customer will remain out of service. Faults on the low-voltage network are handled by fuses or local circuit breakers, resulting in loss of service only for the affected loads. Grid networks Layout of a grid low-voltage network A grid networks consist of an interconnected grid of circuits, energized from several primary feeders through distribution transformers at multiple locations. Grid networks are typically featured in downtowns of large cities, with connecting cables laid out in underground conduits along the streets. Numerous cables allow for multiple current paths from every transformer to every load within the grid. As with spot networks, network protectors are used to protect against primary feeder faults, and prevent fault current to propagate from the grid to the primary feeder. Individual cable sections may be protected by cable limiters on both ends, special fuses providing very fast short-circuit protection. Cable limiters do not have an ampere rating, and cannot be used to provide overload protection; their sole purpose is to isolate the fault. Under high short-circuit conditions, limiters blow and cut off the faulted cable, while the unaffected cables take over its load and continue to provide service. Primary feeder outages, as well as limiters and network protectors cleared because of previous faults, cause changes in load flow that are not readily detected, so their statuses may require a periodic inspection. The inherent system redundancy generally prevents any customer from experiencing outage.

Three other canine abuse cases feature: a rottweiler who was boarded in a kennel, but starved to death and two dogs who were burn victims, one of which was the first to test the new Gucci's Law. In Care2, Alicia Graef described the film, \\"It began back in 1994, when a 10-week-old puppy named Gucci was hung from a tree, beaten, doused in lighter fluid and set on fire by a group of men in Mobile, Alabama. College professor Doug James was nearby by pure chance and rushed to help. He would later become Gucci‚Äôs second owner and together the two would eventually bring about a historic change in Alabama‚Äôs animal cruelty laws through legislation honoring Gucci.\\" Release Film screenings include the following: *Missoula, Montana - Big Sky Documentary Film Festival, February 14, 2015 *Phoenix, Arizona - Phoenix Film Festival, March 27, 2015 *New Haven, Connecticut - New Haven Documentary Film Festival, June 7, 2015 *Birmingham, Alabama - Sidewalk Moving Picture Festival, August 30, 2015 *Mobile, Alabama - Crescent Theater, September 22, 2015 *Bay City, Michigan - Hell's Half Mile Film and Music Festival, September 27, 2015 *DVD release from MVD entertainment, April 19, 2016 *The film is available on digital streaming platforms iTunes, Amazon Prime, Google Play, and via pay-per-view on DirecTV.

It was produced by Dean Falcone, who also wrote the film's score. One Voice was released on Record Store Day, April 16, 2016, with profits from the sale of the single going to benefit animal charities.  Critical response  Writing on The Movie Guys website, Ray Schillaci said, \\"Where many could have focused on the cruelty and the perpetrator, Bechard chooses to highlight the fight against such viciousness, the happiness and companionship that blossoms, and the bureaucratic struggles to achieve what is right. It‚Äôs a wonderful and beautiful testament to Gucci, his owner, and all other animals and the people that care for them.\\" Joey Kennedy, in the Animal Advocates of Alabama website, said, \\"Perhaps what is so remarkable about the film is how well Bechard is able to convey Gucci's charming personality. Bechard never met the dog, yet viewers left the theater feeling as if they had known Gucci personally. It would have been easy for Bechard to slip into over-sentimentality, but he doesn't. The story itself, especially as told mostly by James, is powerful enough without gimmicks.\\".\\" Ralph Tribbey, in the DVD & Blu-Ray Release Report called it \\"a heartfelt tale of love, kindness and a story of a man and his dog ‚Ä¶ a man and his dog on a very special mission.\\" Jonathan Tressler, in the News-Herald, called it, \\"shocking, yet inspirational.\\" Amos Lassen called the film, \\"a positive and uplifting look at one victim who went on to become a hero.

It was built as the Hotel Palace Luzern between 1904 and 1906, and is officially designated as a cultural asset of national importance (Conservation Grade B).Kanton Luzern, KGS-Inventar, Provisorische Liste der B-Objekte (PDF), Inventarauszug mit Stand vom 1. M√§rz 2014 des Fachbereichs Kulturg√ºterschutz im Bundesamt f√ºr Bev√∂lkerungsschutz (BABS) History In 1903 Franz Josef Bucher, a farmer's son who by this time had become well established as a hotel pioneer-entrepreneur, purchased a 3,285 square metre plot of land at one end of the \\"National Quai\\" (\\"Nationalquai\\") in Lucerne for a price of 880,000 Swiss francs. The price equated to 270 Swiss Francs square metre which at that time was \\"sensationally\\" expensive for a 3,000 square metre building plot. Construction began in July 1904, using plans provided by the Heinrich Meili-Wapf architectural business, and less than two years later, on 7 May 1906, The Hotel Palace Luzern opened. Building costs had amounted to a \\"sensational\\" four million Swiss francs. All the south-facing rooms with a lake view, as well as all the east-facing rooms, came with an en suite bathroom, which was considered the height of luxury. The Palace Luzern was also unusually large, with a total of 120 private bathrooms shared between 350 beds. That made it substantially larger than the city's existing grand hotels: The National had 79 private bathrooms shared between 450 beds, while the Schweizerhof made do with only 70 private bathrooms shared between 400 beds. The Palace Luzern was considered one of the most elegant hotels in the world. Bookings during the first summer season were strong, apparently justifying the massive investment. However, Bucher's determination to make the Luzern Palace the city's number one hotel came with a considerable additional cost which he may not have anticipated, in the form of the envy of Lucerne's existing top hoteliers. Wealthy tourists staying in Luzern as part of a tour would frequently ask the reception staff to book their next hotels, and the competitor hoteliers in Luzern reacted with an effective bookings boycott of Bucher's other hotels in city destinations such as Lugano, Milan, Genoa and Rome. After the outbreak of the First World War the hotel had to be closed, but business resumed following the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, and business boomed through most of the 1920s. At the end of the decade bookings nevertheless dropped off in the aftermath of the Wall Street Crash, and debt financing accordingly became more burdensome for the business. By the time the Second World War broke out in 1939 the Luzern Palace was the only significant hotel still held in Franz Josef Bucher's once extensive \\"Schweizerische Hotelgesellschaft AG\\" hotels portfolio. During the Second World War the hotel became a medical centre: it was also used as a storage location for essential basic supplies. After a two-year renovation programme costing 1.5 Million Swiss francs the hotel reopened in 1946, returned to its former luxury. Since the 1970s the hotel has undergone a succession of changes and upgrades, and adapted for year-round operation. During the winter of 1993/94 the top two floors were rebuilt at a cost of 15 Million Swiss francs, yielding an additional 48 rooms and suites. In October 1997 the Palace Luzern, by now under the control of General Director J√ºrg Reinshagen and his brother Ernst was taken over by the hotel specialists Victoria-Jungfrau Collection AG, owners of the Victoria-Jungfrau Grand Hotel & Spa in Interlaken. By this time the two five star hotels had already been collaborating closely for some years and the take-over was reportedly a \\"friendly\\" one. In 2011, following the currency realignments triggered by the world economic crisis of 2007/09, Swiss hotels came under financial pressure, in common with other export dependent labour-intensive sectors, and in 2011 the owners sold the Hotel Palace Luzern building to \\"CS Funds AG\\", an investment fund belonging to Credit Suisse (bank), in a \\"sale and leaseback\\" deal.Hotels m√ºssen einzigartig sein. In: Neue Luzerner Zeitung, 14 October 2015, p. 11 In October 2015 it became known that the bank was looking to sell the building on.

An alcohol interlock consists basically of an instrument measuring breath alcohol and a vehicle immobilizer. The installation is possible in different types of vehicles like passenger cars, buses, transporters, motorcycles or trains. A breath sample has to be delivered to the alcohol interlock before the vehicle motor can be started or the vehicle can be moved. The alcohol interlock will prevent the driver to start the motor if he/she has an alcohol concentration above a predetermined limit value. An alcohol interlock consists of two main components: the breath alcohol measuring instrument with the measuring system and a mouthpiece located in the interior of the vehicle, and the control unit normally installed under the dashboard and unblocking, resp. blocking the current supply to the starter relay of the vehicle. There are several areas in which alcohol interlocks may be used: * installed in a vehicle as a general preventive measure for the promotion of traffic safety, on a voluntary base or legally required in certain vehicles (for example vehicles for children transport), or * in vehicles as ordered by a court or an administrative authority as part of a drink-driving offender programme, or * for persons subject to a medical or rehabilitation programme.  Standard series EN 50436  The series of European Standards EN 50436 ‚ÄûAlcohol interlocks - Test methods and performance requirements‚Äú are developed since the year 2013 by the committee BTTF 116-2 ‚ÄûAlcohol interlocks‚Äú of the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC). The members have been nominated by the national standardisation organisations of numerous European countries. They represent ministries, road traffic authorities, road safety organisations, labour unions, testing laboratories as well as manufacturers of alcohol interlocks and vehicles. The secretariat of the committee is organized by Deutsche Kommission Elektrotechnik Elektronik Informationstechnik im DIN und VDE (DKE). The committee has under the chairmanship of Dr.habil Johannes Lagois and since 2016 of Dr. Stefan Morley developed the series EN 50436 of European Standards. The compliance with these standards is in the meantime required in laws and regulations of several European countries as technical requirement for the use of alcohol interlocks. The series EN 50436 specifies the test procedures and basic performance requirements for alcohol interlocks and gives guidance to authorities, decision makers, purchasers and users. Additionally, it describes the requirements for vehicles for the installation alcohol interlocks.

It covers alcohol interlocks intended to be used in programmes for drink driving offenders as well as in programmes monitored or controlled in a comparable way. This European Standard also applies to alcohol interlocks integrated into other control systems of the vehicle as well as to accessory devices connected to the alcohol interlock. This European Standard is directed with its technical details mainly at test laboratories and manufacturers of alcohol interlocks. It defines requirements and test procedures for type testing. The most important very comprehensive tests and requirements described in this standard are: * measurement accuracy of the alcohol concentration, * environmental tests with different ambient temperatures and humidity, * tests of time to be ready, * durability tests with vibrations and dropping, * measures against circumvention and manipulation, * influence of other exhaled gases than alcohol, * long term behaviour, * electrical tests for supply voltage and durability against short-circuits, * electromagnetic compatibility and electrical disturbances, * content of the instructions for installation and use. The 2nd edition has been basically revised compared to the 1st edition, the amount of the tests considerably extended and the requirements tightened. The 2nd edition includes now also accessory devices of the alcohol interlock authorised by the manufacturer as being part of the alcohol interlock system and which are intended to be used in the vehicle during operation. These are for example cameras or GPS systems generating data related to event data of the alcohol interlock, as well as accessory devices handling or transferring data for a drink-driving-offender programme. The content and requirements are based on the experience and necessities of drink driving offender programmes in different countries over several decades. Therefore, alcohol interlocks used in programmes for drink driving offenders programmes should be tested according to this European Standard and fulfil its requirements.

In the 2nd edition of EN 50436-2 now is EN 50436-1 the basic standard and the text of part 2 describes only the differences in the requirements compared to part 1. The most important differences of the tests and requirements of part 2 compared to part 1 are the following: * the required temperature range within which the alcohol interlock has to perform and measure properly is -20 ¬∞C to 70 ¬∞C (instead of -40 ¬∞C to 85 ¬∞C); * the requirement for the measurement accuracy at high alcohol concentrations (from 0,75 mg/l) is reduced; * the provision of a data memory is optional.

However, it is not mandatory and it does not contain any requirements. The purpose of this European Standard is in the series of European Standards for alcohol interlocks is to guide in selection, installation, use and maintenance of alcohol interlocks. It is directed to persons being interested in alcohol interlocks, to companies selling and installing alcohol interlocks, and to purchasers and users. The European Standard informs about the alcohol interlock and its use. This European Standard describes alcohol interlocks used as a general preventive measure in traffic safety as well as in drink driving offender programmes. The 2nd edition has been basically revised compared to the 1st edition. Besides the use of alcohol interlocks as a preventive measure, the use in drink driving offender programmes is addressed more in detail, for example with the description of the basic steps of such a programme. Additionally, the 2nd edition contains a compilation of typical parameter settings of the instruments.

It details the types of the connectors, the assignment of the connector pins as well as the digital information to be exchanged between the vehicle and the alcohol interlock via a LIN data bus. This European Standard is applicable to alcohol interlocks for drink-driving-offender programs (as in EN 50436-1) as well as to alcohol interlocks for general preventive use (as in EN 50436-2). This European Standard is mostly intended for vehicle manufacturers and manufacturers of alcohol interlocks. The published draft of the 1st edition was based on the state of the technology at that time. However, it has been foreseen that a data bus interface will become the much better solution in the future. This caused that the project has been stopped at this time. In the year 2014 it has been restarted together with the development of part 7. Part 4 will then describe the details of such a data bus interface.  EN 50436-5  ‚ÄûEN 50436-5: Alcohol interlocks - Test methods and performance requirements - Part 5: Instruments measuring breath alcohol for general preventive use, not having a mouthpiece and compensating by carbon dioxide measurement\\" * No draft published, project stopped This European Standard was intended to specify additional test procedures and requirements for alcohol interlocks which may be used without an (exchangeable) mouthpiece. With such an instrument the driver has to blow against a sampling area at the surface of the alcohol interlock. However, in doing so the (eventually alcohol containing) breath air is diluted by mixing with ambient air. To determine the actual breath alcohol concentration, techniques are necessary for compensation of the dilution. The dilution may be determined for example by simultaneous measurement of the carbon dioxide concentration. During the discussion of the draft of the European Standard, however, it pointed out that the content of carbon dioxide in the exhaled breath air may vary so strongly depending on the physiological condition of the driver that with the actually applicable techniques the determination of the breath alcohol concentration is not possible with the accuracy necessary for the application in an alcohol interlock.  EN 50436-6  ‚ÄûEN 50436-6: Alcohol interlocks - Test methods and performance requirements - Part 6: Data security\\" * 1st edition: March 2015[EUROPEAN STANDARD EN 50436-6 ‚ÄûAlcohol interlocks - Test methods and performance requirements - Part 6: Data security‚Äú, European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization, Brussels, Avenue Marnix 17, March 2015] This European Standard specifies additional security requirements for the protection and handling of event records which are stored in the data memory of alcohol interlocks and which may be downloaded, processed and transferred to supervising persons or organizations. Optional accessory devices of the alcohol interlock (e.g. cameras or GPS systems) generating data related to event data of the alcohol interlock, as well as accessory devices handling or transferring data for a drink-driving-offender programme come also under this standard. This European Standard is a supplement to EN 50436-1 and EN 50436-2. It is to be decided by the respective jurisdiction or a vehicle fleet operator whether the standard has to be applied in addition to EN 50436-1, resp. EN 50436-2. This European Standard is mainly directed to test houses, manufacturers of alcohol interlocks, legislating authorities and organizations which handle and use the alcohol interlock event records. The standard has been developed on the basis of the Dutch ‚ÄûProtection Profile\\" for alcohol interlocks which is listed under the \\"Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation‚Äú.  EN 50436-7  ‚ÄûEN 50436-7: Alcohol interlocks - Test methods and performance requirements - Part 7: Installation document\\" * 1st edition: December 2016,[EUROPEAN STANDARD EN 50436-7 ‚ÄûAlcohol interlocks - Test methods and performance requirements - Part 7: Installation document‚Äú, European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization, Brussels, Avenue Marnix 17, December 2016] Alcohol interlocks are often intended for aftermarket installation. For this purpose, they are connected to the electric and control circuits of the vehicle. This installation of an alcohol interlock should not interfere with the proper performance of the vehicle, should not impair the safety and security of the vehicle, and should be as straightforward as possible. Additionally, the installation costs should be low in relation to the total cost of the alcohol interlock. Therefore, it is desirable to have a standardized installation document designed by the vehicle manufacturer to give the necessary details to the technicians installing an alcohol interlock into a certain vehicle model. This European Standard defines the content and the layout of such an installation document. It details the type of the vehicle, connection schematics, accessibility instructions and recommendations to avoid safety risks. This European Standard is applicable to alcohol interlocks for drink-driving-offender programs (as in EN 50436-1) as well as to alcohol interlocks for general preventive use (as in EN 50436-2). This European Standard is mostly intended for vehicle manufacturers and manufacturers of alcohol interlocks. The technical requirements listed in EN 50436-7 mirror the requirements given in other parts of the series of standards or of standards referenced there. To fulfill EN 50436-7 the documentation as such needs to be compliant to the standard and obviously the necessary functionality needs to be available. The main requirements are listed in Table C.1, where three principal installation options are listed. Vehicle manufacturers are mandated to provide at least one of these options to comply with EN 50436-7. # The first option is the classical or traditional way to install an alcohol interlock. Here the voltage supply between the vehicle's ignition switch and the starter system is interrupted. The alcohol interlock is fitted with its output relay into the interrupted starter circuit to enable or disable the start of the motor. # The second option is a semi-digital connection in which vehicle interfaces to the alcohol interlock through fixed signal lines that are established in the vehicle for this purpose and by this avoids the interruption of any vehicle (starter) lines. # Finally, EN 50436-7 allows for a digital interface. This is the connection to an internal data bus of the vehicle for information exchange between the vehicle and the alcohol interlock. EN 50436-7 already gives hint to such a digital interface, which is standardised in the fourth part of the series, namely EN 50436-4. This part of the series was first published in February 2019 and is currently extended to also cover the CAN data bus in addition to the LIN data bus. The specified values, in detail those for current and voltage, that are listed in Table C.1 mirror the minimum requirements for alcohol interlocks according to EN 50436-1 and therefore are mandatory for traditional and semi-digital installations. In those cases where an installation using EN 50436-4 is chosen, the current and voltage requirements of EN 50436-4 apply, because in this case both sides of the interface, the vehicle and the alcohol interlock, shall be certified against EN 50436-4. The use of EN 50436-4 is not mandated by EN 50436-7. This in principle would make other proprietary solutions of vehicle manufacturers possible. Proprietary solutions obviously shall not contradict the requirements for alcohol interlocks given in the EN 50436 series of standards. However, they need to be fully disclosed and described with their referring test plans in the installation document according to EN 50436-7 and fulfill the current and voltage requirements for the traditional installation. Hence, as EN 50436-4 provides a standardized digital interface that facilitates the fitting of aftermarket alcohol interlock devices in motor vehicles as well as their factory fitting, it is strongly recommended to choose this interface. It has been realized in the European Union that the aftermarket installation of an alcohol interlock becomes more and more difficult in modern vehicles and therefore generates a barrier for the use of alcohol interlocks.Study on behalf of the European Commission: \\"Study on the prevention of drink-driving by the use of alcohol interlock devices\\" Therefore, it is planned to bindingly prescribe the preparation of an installation document according EN 50436-7 by the vehicle manufacturer within the framework of the vehicle type approval.Report on behalf of the European Commission: \\"Benefit and feasibility of a range of new technologies and unregulated measures in the field of vehicle occupant safety and protection of vulnerable road users\\" References #50436 Vehicle technology ","title":"EN 50436"},{"id":"48516637","text":"Baguettes are small, compact handbags, designed by Italian fashion company Fendi in 1997. Popularized on Sex and the City in the late 1990s and early 2000s, this product is often cited as the first it bag. With the Baguette, Fendi sparked the \\"buy-a-bag-a-day habit\\" by rapidly declining it into hundreds of different designs and sold more than a million units in 20 years.  History  The Baguette concept was for a small, streamlined bag, carried on a short strap, that could be adapted for different looks, colors and textures while still having a consistent aesthetic. It marked a contrast from many popular purses at the time, which were large totes. Small and little- known, Fendi lent Baguettes as props for HBO's Sex and the City, a new show that was fast growing in popularity. In one of the episodes, Carrie Bradshaw gets mugged in a narrow street. The robber asks for her \\"bag\\", to which Carrie replies \\"it's a Baguette\\". Fendi was the first luxury house to lend a piece to Patricia Field, the show's costume designer and stylist. Sarah Jessica Parker has credited her bag for establishing the show and her character, Carrie Bradshaw, saying \\"Having Carrie wear the Baguette was a defining moment for us, and marked the beginning of everything\\".Achille Bonito Oliva et. al., The Fendi Baguette Book, New York: Rizzoli Press, 2012. The success of the Baguette bag led LVMH to acquire Fendi in 1999. In 2012, to celebrate the bag's 15th birthday and its +1000 original creations, Fendi organized an exhibition at the Colette store in Paris. In 2019, Fendi relaunched the Baguette bag, designed by Silvia Venturini Fendi, creator of the original Baguette. A few months later, Fendi partnered with the perfumer Francis Kurkdjian to launch the first-ever fragrance-infused bag. The scent was named ‚ÄòFendiFrenesia‚Äô and influenced directly into the leather of Baguette bags (the scent lasts three years). A Baguette bag for men was also launched.

Early life Everett was the son of Ellen Ada and Harold Bulmer Everett, a chartered accountant of Epsom, Surrey. He was the youngest of 9 children (6 girls and 3 boys). They lived at 30 Woodcote Park Road in Epsom, Surrey. He was educated at Kingswood House Preparatory School in Epsom and later the City of London Freemen's School in Ashtead Park, Surrey. He was considered an accomplished all-round sportsman. Prior to joining the RAF he worked in London for his uncle Tom Mcnabb. Royal Air Force service Everett enlisted in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve around May 1940, probably at RAF Uxbridge and was allocated service number 1263497. He trained to fly with the rank of Sergeant and in July 1942 he was stationed at RAF Bicester, flying as a pilot with No. 13 Operational Training Unit which trained light day bomber aircrew in Bristol Blenheims. His next posting was to No. 1652 Heavy Conversion Unit, at RAF Marston Moor. Having been posted to No. 158 Squadron RAF at RAF Lissett on 28 February 1943 to fly Handley Page Halifax bombers he flew several operations as second pilot in March and April 1943. On 4 September 1943 he was detached to No. 1502 Beam Approach Training Flight at RAF Driffield, where he operationally tested recently developed equipment designed to improve the bombing accuracy of new crews in his next six operations through April and May 1943. Everett was commissioned pilot officer on 29 May 1943 and issued service number 155223 before joining No. 35 Squadron RAF, Pathfinder Force at RAF Graveley. Pathfinder Force Serving with No. 35 Squadron RAF of the RAF Pathfinder Force Everett was recommended for a medal and then promoted to flying officer on 29 November 1943. Everett was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross announced in the London Gazette on 21 January 1944. No citation was published but the original recommendation dated 29 October 1943 read: ‚Äì Handley Page Halifax bomber Pilot Officer Everett was captain of an aircraft detailed to attack Kassel on the night of 22/23 October 1943. En route to the target the weather was particularly bad and some of his blind flying instruments became inoperative owing to the icing conditions. This officer carried on despite this handicap as he fully realised the importance of this special task and at the target he made a most successful attack, this being proved by an excellent photograph. Throughout the 33 night bombing attacks in which he has taken part, Pilot Officer Everett has consistently maintained an extremely high standard of tenacity and reliability and it is considered that the fine results he achieved in this attack fully merits the immediate (amended to non- immediate by the AOC) award of the Distinguished Flying Cross. On completion of his Pathfinder Force tour of 45 operations Everett was posted from No. 35 Squadron RAF to the Pathfinder Force Navigational Training Unit for some months \\"rest\\". Lancaster which returned without its rear turret. He requested a return to operational flying and rejoined No. 35 Squadron RAF on 22 August 1944. Everett was awarded a Bar to the Distinguished Flying Cross as an acting flight lieutenant published in the London Gazette on 16 January 1945. No citation detailed but the original recommendation dated 21 October 1944 read: ‚Äì This officer, now on his second operational tour, is a brilliant captain of aircraft, possessing the greatest determination on operations and the utmost thoroughness in all matters of airmanship. Since being awarded the DFC he has taken part in many attacks against the enemy on widely separated targets such as Berlin, Nuremberg, the Ruhr and Army support attacks in Normandy. Whatever the target and whatever the task, he can be depended upon to mark and bomb with the greatest reliability. Flight Lieutenant Everett continues to show the keenest desire to operate against the enemy on all possible occasions and his enthusiasm and efficiency sets an example to the entire Squadron. In recognition of this Officer's fine record of service, he is recommended for the non-immediate award of a Bar to the Distinguished Flying Cross. Avro Lancaster bomber On 14 January 1945 he had piloted an Avro Lancaster serial number \\"PB684\\", squadron codes TL-B from RAF Graveley to Merseburg ‚Äì Leuna. Over the target area his aircraft was hit by a bomb dropped by a friendly aircraft, the rear turret was smashed and later broke away taking with it the body of the rear gunner flying officer Raymond Salvoni, DFC, who was believed to have been killed by the impact of the bomb. Everett brought the aircraft home safely.Musgrove (1992), p.168 On 18 February 1945 Everett was recommended for the award of a Distinguished Service Order, which was later changed to a second Bar to the Distinguished Flying Cross. One night in February 1945, Squadron Leader Everett was pilot and captain of an aircraft detailed to attack Goch. Whilst making his first run over the target his aircraft was badly hit. The starboard main plane was extensively damaged and the starboard inner engine caught fire. Momentarily the aircraft went out of control. Squadron Leader Everett quickly levelled out though and feathered the propeller of the burning engine. The flames were then extinguished. Although unable to assess the full extent of the damage sustained, Squadron Leader Everett went on to make several further bombing runs over the target, which he only left after he was satisfied as to the success of the operation. He afterwards flew the badly damaged aircraft safely to base. This officer displayed a high degree of skill, courage and resolution throughout.\\" His award was published in the London Gazette on 27 March 1945. Distinguished Flying Cross with a Bar Everett was promoted full flight lieutenant and appointed acting squadron leader on 25 February 1945. The total number of operations he flew was astounding: he is recorded with various totals from 99 to 120.Bowyer (1979), p.30 Killed in action Everett was ordered to take a rest from operations but continued to look for opportunities to fly and on 7 March 1945 gathered a \\"scratch crew\\" of senior airmen for a spare Avro Lancaster aircraft, serial number \\"ME361\\", to lead 256 Halifaxes and 25 Lancasters of Nos. 4, 6 and 8 Groups to attack the Deutsche Erd√∂l- Aktiengesellschaft oil refinery at Hemmingstedt, near Heide.Musgrove, p.169 Everett took off at 18:53 hours from RAF Graveley as Master Bomber.

Education and career  She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in biology at Harvard College, a Bachelor of Science degree in natural science education at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, and a PhD in ecology and behavioral biology at the University of Minnesota. Oberhauser is an adjunct professor in the Fisheries, Wildlife and Conservation Biology department and former director of the Monarch Lab at the University of Minnesota. In October 2017, she became the director of the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison Arboretum, in Madison, Wisconsin.  Research  Oberhauser has been studying monarch butterflies since 1984. Her research has addressed many aspects of monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) ecology, including reproduction, parasites, factors influencing immature monarch distribution and abundance, and impacts of insecticides, global climate change, and genetically-modified crops. In addition to authoring many publications in scholarly journals, she was also co-editor for two books published by Cornell Press: *The Monarch Butterfly: Biology and Conservation *Monarchs in a Changing World: Biology and Conservation of an Iconic Butterfly In 2014, Oberhauser and a colleague published a scientific article examining how usage of Monsanto's Roundup herbicide on farmland in North America contributes to the decline of milkweeds, important food sources for the butterflies. They found that the size of populations of milkweed were smaller in areas of increased Roundup use, suggesting that the loss of this food source may contribute to the decline of monarchs. The milkweed limitation hypothesis as this has become known, has been tested by other groups of scientists finding conflicting results. Thus, the actual contribution of Roundup use and loss of populations of milkweed to the decline of monarch butterflies is still unclear.  Career activism  Oberhauser is a strong proponent of citizen science, environmental and scientific literacy. She is currently a member of the Editorial Board for Citizen Science: Theory and Practice. In 2013, she was named a Champion of Change for Citizen Science by the White House. President Eric Kaler of the University of Minnesota stated that \\"Professor Oberhauser represents the best and the brightest in our faculty here at the University of Minnesota. Her work with citizen scientists, teachers and elementary school students exemplifies the deep importance we place on public engagement, which is a core part of the University‚Äôs land grant mission.\\" Oberhauser has been director for the Monarchs in the Classroom Program, president of the Monarch Butterfly Sanctuary Foundation and director of the Monarch Larva Monitoring Project.

Walseth was born in Aberdeen, South Dakota and an all-state basketball player at Pierre High School, graduating in 1944. He joined the U. S. Navy, and was ultimately moved to Colorado where he attended the University of Colorado and was a member of the basketball and baseball teams. Following his graduation, he stayed at Colorado to earn a master's degree and coach the freshman team. He then moved on to coach Arvin High School in Arvin, California for the 1953‚Äì54 season. Walseth moved to the college ranks the following season as he was named head coach at South Dakota State. He led the Jackrabbits to a significant improvement, as he compiled records of 14‚Äì11, then 17‚Äì7 in his two seasons. In the 1955‚Äì56 season he led the team to the North Central Conference championship and a berth in the 1956 NAIA Tournament. This performance helped Walseth earn the Colorado head coaching job when his former mentor Bebe Lee was named athletic director at Kansas State University. Walseth coached the Buffaloes for twenty seasons, compiling a 261‚Äì245 record. His teams won three Big Eight Conference championships (in 1962, 1963 and 1969) and won the league's Coach of the Year award four times (1962, 1963, 1969 and 1973). Under his watch, Ken Charlton and Cliff Meely earned All-American honors. Walseth was relieved of his duties following the 1975‚Äì76 season, but was coaxed out of retirement in 1980 to oversee the Buffaloes' women's team for three seasons, compiling a record of 77‚Äì21. He was the first person to coach both men's and women's basketball at the same school. Walseth died at his home in Boulder, Colorado on January 28, 2004 at the age of 77.

This technique is still used in Chinese quilting. Silk or cotton is used to make the patchwork. The design for the patchwork often told a story of Chinese folklore.  Patterns  Many patterns exist, while the quilting block is one that is widely used. Other patterns include the Chinese coin, 100 good wishes and lattice. Some may include squares, triangles, hexagons and diamonds. Traditional culture and folk legends are often the themes for patchworks, such as the Qilin Bringing the Child, Door Gods, the Dragon King and the Kitchen God.  Folklore  People started making Chinese patchwork in the Liu Song of the Southern Dynasty. The first emperor of Liu Song Dynasty, named Liu Yu, was born in an underprivileged family. His mother gathered rags from the neighborhoods to make a patchwork. When he became the emperor, he perceived this kind of patchwork as the symbol for his impoverished childhood. All the infants in Liu‚Äôs family had to use the patchwork so that his offspring could know how fortunate they were. Afterwards, his citizens followed this royal custom to make \\"Bai jia yi\\" for their babies.  Process  The patches are cut into similar sizes and shapes and then leave at least 1/2-inch on each side of the patch for a seam. Arrange them in patterns or at random. Hold two patches face-to-face and stitch them together. Continue this process until the front of the quilt has been sewn into one solid piece.  Cultural meanings  Chinese patchwork is a symbol of good luck. Every patch represents the blessing of people towards the baby. In the past, due to the lag in health care and education, infant mortality was relatively high. Nevertheless, people believed that an infant's death was due to a ghost.  Different uses  The uses of patchwork are not limited to traditional clothing but have been widely used in modern society for curtains, children's shoes, caps, dudous, scarves, women's handbags, aprons, men's cigarette cases and wallets.

Different rituals are carried out in different parts of China, and many contemporary Chinese people carry out funerals according to various religious faiths such as Buddhism or Christianity. However, in general, the funeral ceremony itself is carried out over seven days, and mourners wear funerary dress according to their relationship to the deceased. Traditionally, white clothing is symbolic of the dead, while red is not usually worn, as it is traditionally the symbolic colour of happiness worn at Chinese weddings. The number three is significant, with many customary gestures being carried out three times. While traditionally inhumation was favoured, in the present day the dead are often cremated rather than buried, particularly in large cities in China. According to the Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs (MCA), of the 9.77 million deaths in 2014, 4.46 million, or 45.6%, were cremated.  History  Throughout history, Chinese people have carried out complex funeral rites, with tombs of early rulers rivalling Ancient Egyptian tombs in their funerary art and provision for the dead in the afterlife. The late 3rd century BCE Terracotta Army contains approximately 9,000 terracotta figures that were buried to protect Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China. Traditional burial customs show a strong belief in life after death and the need for ancestor veneration among the living; Confucian philosophy calls for paying respect to one's ancestors as an act of filial piety (Â≠ù xi√†o). These ideals still inform funeral rites for many Chinese people today.  Practice  It is customary for relatives to hold vigils over the dying, in order to accompany them till the very last moment before entering the afterlife. This process, called shou ling (ÂÆàÈùà), is a way for loved ones to show filial piety and loyalty to the deceased. Family members thus take shifts to watch over a relative on their deathbed. It is common to place a white banner over the door of the household to signify that a death has occurred. Families will usually gather to carry out funeral rituals, in order both to show respect for the dead and to strengthen the bonds of the kin group. Those with closer relationships to the dead (i.e. sons and daughters) wear white garments, while more distant relatives wear garments in different colours of white, black, blue and green. The colours red, yellow, and brown are traditionally not worn during the mourning period, which may last up to three years. Before a funeral, an obituary notice f√πw√©n (Ë®ÉËÅû) is commonly sent to relatives and friends announcing the date and time of the funeral procession. The date is usually selected as an auspicious one according to the Chinese fortune calendar (ÈÄöÂãù tong sheng). The deceased is dressed in clean funeral dress (Â∞èÊÆÆ) in preparation for their departure from the world (‰∫∫‰∏ñ r√©n sh√¨) and journey into the afterlife (‰æÜ‰∏ñ lei sh√¨). D√† li√†n (Â§ßÊÆÆ) is the ritual of transferring the body of deceased into the coffin (ÂÖ•Êú® r√π m√π), which will rest in the funeral hall decorated with four character idioms (ÊàêËØ≠ cheng yu) prior to the burial or cremation. Before the funeral procession, the jiƒÅ j√¨ (ÂÆ∂Á•≠) is held. According to the closeness and status of the family members, they will pay respects di√†n (Â•†) to the deceased. According to Chinese custom, an elder should never show respect to someone younger. So, if the deceased is a young bachelor, for example, his body cannot be brought home and must remain at the funeral parlor. His parents cannot offer prayers to their son either. Since he was unmarried, he did not have any children who could perform these same rites for him. (This is why the body cannot come into the family home.) If an infant or child dies, no funeral rites are performed either since respect cannot be shown to a younger person. The child is thus buried in silence. The funeral procession (ÁôºÂºï fƒÅ y«ên) is the process of bringing the hearse to the burial site or site of cremation. During the funeral, offerings of food items, incense, and joss paper are commonly presented. The offering of food and joss paper signifies the continuing interdependence between the deceased and their living descendants. Taoist or Buddhist prayers are sometimes carried out by monks, to help the deceased's soul to find peace and escape a fate of becoming a \\"restless ghost\\". Every year at the Qing Ming Festival (Ê∏ÖÊòéÁØÄ), people pay respect to their ancestors by visiting their graves and tidying up their tombstones. Later generations are invited to participate through this process of ancestor veneration (ÊÖéÁµÇËøΩÈÅ† sh√®n zh≈çng zhuƒ´ yu«én).

They took the form of bamboo huts and were built by the Hong Kong Government in the 20th century. Swimming sheds gained popularity in the early 20th century because their entrance fees were cheap. Swimming sheds also leased swimwear, at a rate of $0.3HKD for female swimming suits and cheaper for male swimming suits. This attracted many citizens to use swimming sheds during weekends and holidays.  History  In 1911, Chinese Recreation Club (Hong Kong), built a swimming shed in Tsat Tsz Mui, formerly a village, in eastern North Point. It then became the most popular swimming resort, attracting more than 100 thousands of visitors every year. In the 1950s, there were around 8 to 10 swimming sheds in Hong Kong. Among all these swimming sheds, Chung Sing Swimming Shed and Kam Ngan Swimming Shed were the most famous ones, which were located in Kennedy Town and Mount Davis respectively. Moreover, South China Athletic Association built a swimming shed in A Kung Ngam between 1950 and 1972 and many swimming sheds were also built in Lai Chi Kok Bay, in northern Kowloon, which provided boat rental service. In the 1960s, the Hong Kong Government revoked part of the land area of the swimming shed in certain districts for redevelopment. As harbour pollution problem worsened gradually, more swimming sheds were disintegrated and declined. In 1988, Wan Hung Fai, the regimental commander of beach cottage, and his friend‚Äôs application on reopening swimming shed in Sai Wai Victoria Road was approved by the Hong Kong Government, making Sai Wai Swimming Shed the one and only swimming shed in Hong Kong now. There were facilities like office, changing rooms for both male and female, lockers etc.; opened to the public from 5:00 am to 1:00 pm, charged HKD$120 per month. On 22 October 2012, LEUNG Chun-ying, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, pointed out that the water quality of the harbour has been improving since all major sewage treatment and purification projects are nearly completed. He suggested building more swimming sheds on both sides of the harbour, and in turn encouraging people, particularly those working on both sides of the Victoria Harbour, to swim or do a little fishing to reduce stress.Cross-harbour race However, Professor Ho Kin-chung, Dean of the School of Science and Technology in the Open University of Hong Kong, indicated that the water quality is not suitable for swimming now, not until the completion of the second phase of the effluent treatment projects wraps up. But he agrees that the consideration of building swimming sheds in both sides of the Victoria Harbour is feasible because many citizens swim in Hung Hom and North Point, however, with no facilities provided.  Tourist spot  Nowadays, the swimming shed is still used by older swimmers and residents of the neighbourhood early in the morning. It is also a popular photo location among enthusiasts and newlyweds.  Sai Wan Swimming Shed  Sai Wan Swimming Shed is the only shed that is still in service in Hong Kong. It was set by the government in the 60s to 70s in which regular swimming facilities weren't common. It is on the brink of the Hong Kong island, outlining the Victoria Road and Mount Davis. It functions as a hybrid of swimming lot and photo-taking spot for photography lovers, for its vantage point which helps visitors see the small island to the West of the shed, the beacon and the sunset. Users could also get changed and store their personal belongings in the shed. After settling down, swimmers walk along the shed and start enjoying their laps.  Accidents  On 29 September 2007 in Victoria Road and Deep Water Bay, a swimmer drowned in an early morning accident. The swimmer, who worked in Sai Wan Swimming Shed, was swimming after work.

There was evidently a house there by the early 13th century, when a man surnamed of the plock was recorded, and Plock Court, east of the road, occupied the site of a medieval manor house. In 1851 market gardeners were fairly numerous in Longford and Twigworth, and later there were several market gardens and nurseries at Longlevens (called Springfield) and Innsworth.

The home, a converted villa east of the Tewkesbury Road, was occupied by the sisters of St. Lucy, an Anglican community founded in 1864 by Thomas Gambier Parry of Highnam to train nurses and tend the sick in their homes. By 1866 the sisters, who were sent to many parts of the country, nursed some patients in the home. Gambier Parry also conceived the idea for the children's hospital in connection with the home and paid much of the building costs. The hospital, a brick building designed by William Jacques, opened in 1867 with 22 beds. Children of the poor from any distance were admitted and out-patients were treated at a house in Bell Lane. The hospital was supported by subscriptions and donations. In 1872 the sisters of St. John the Baptist from Clewer, Berkshire, took over the work of the sisters of St. Lucy. In 1876, Gambier Parry moved the home to a large house at the corner of Hare Lane and Pitt Street. Education Longford Park Primary Academy,Longford Park Primary Academy , ', Gloucestershire.

The episode was written by Corey Reed and directed by Avi Youabian. The Alexandria community deals with the aftermath of the Wolves' attack. Plot As the Alexandrians clean up following the Wolves' invasion, Rick appears running toward the gate, shouting for it to be opened, as the walkers which escaped from the main herd pursue. He gets inside before the walkers surround the town, and instructs the townspeople to keep noise and light to a minimum until the rest of his team returns. Aaron sadly confesses that the Wolves discovered the Safe-Zone because of him, which shatters what's left of the town's spirits. That night, a drunken Spencer has an angry argument with his mother, Deanna, during which he blames her for the deaths of his father and brother. Elsewhere, Carl approaches Ron about Enid, who disappeared during the Wolves' attack, and asks him to help him find her. Ron refuses and threatens to tell Rick if Carl goes outside the walls. Tara visits Denise, who is operating on the injured Scott, and discovers that Denise is struggling with her lack of knowledge as a doctor and wants to quit. Maggie, upon learning that Glenn and Nicholas have disappeared, arms herself and prepares to go out and look for Glenn. Aaron insists upon accompanying her, on the basis that it will be too dangerous for her to go alone. She agrees, and follows him through a sewer that takes them under the wall and bypasses the walkers surrounding it. After fending off a couple of walkers in the sewer, they reach the exit, only to discover that the back end of the herd is right outside. Despondent, Maggie admits defeat and tearfully reveals to Aaron that she is pregnant. With morale at an all-time low in Alexandria, Jessie goes to check on David's widow, Betsy, but discovers that she committed suicide and is now a walker. The commotion draws the attention of the other townspeople, and in their presence, Jessie kills the zombified Betsy. She tells them she understands not wanting to acknowledge how things are, but that fighting is the new reality they must live with. This empowers the rest of the town to start taking action. Ron goes to find Rick and tells him that he is ready to learn how to handle a gun, while Maggie and Aaron erase Glenn and Nicholas' names from the memorial wall that has been set up, hoping they might still be alive. Denise reads through the medical journals and comes up with a solution to save Scott. Later, she finds Tara and kisses her. That evening, Rick and Deanna converse about the recent events. Deanna admits she is not fit to lead the town and appoints Rick the new leader of Alexandria. Later, he visits Jessie in her garage, and they kiss. Deanna, meanwhile, goes to the gate and bangs it defiantly. As she leaves, however, she fails to notice a trickle of blood pouring through a crack in the wall. Reception=Critical reception The episode received mostly negative reviews from critics. It currently holds a 44% rating with an average score of 5.8 out of 10 on Rotten Tomatoes, with the critical consensus being that it \\"provides deeper portrayals of some of the Alexandria crew -- but at the expense of furthering the stories of the Walking Dead characters we actually care about.\\" Brian Moylan of The Guardian, in his review of the episode, commented that the episode fails to explain how Rick escaped from his stalled camper van in \\"Thank You\\", and described it as \\"a spare, quiet episode, fraught with moments of uncertainty and tension.\\" Ron Hogan from Den of Geek! praised the performance of Tovah Feldshuh, Youabian's direction and Reed's writing, and described the episode as \\"brisk\\" and \\"speech heavy.\\" Alex Straker of The Independent remarked that the episode \\"is something of an oddity, an episode that initially suggests another adrenaline- heavy hour of intense action but never really delivers what it promises.\\" Ratings The episode averaged a 6.2 rating in adults 18-49 and 12.44 million viewers overall, a decrease from the previous episode, which averaged a 6.8 rating and 13.34 million.

The news division is based out of the network's facilities in the Miami suburb of Hialeah, Florida. The division produces a flagship nightly early-evening newscast, Noticias Telemundo, focusing on international news and stories of relevance to the network's main target demographic of Hispanic and Latino Americans. Other programs produced by the news division include morning news-talk show Un Nuevo D√≠a, newsmagazine series Al Rojo Vivo con Mar√≠a Celeste, and Sunday morning political affairs program Enfoque con Jose Diaz-Balart. Noticias Telemundo maintains bureaus located at many of the network's television stations across the United States (particularly those owned by parent subsidiary Telemundo Station Group, that are owned-and-operated stations of the network) and throughout Latin America, and uses video content from English language sister network NBC's news division NBC News. Background The history of Noticias Telemundo traces back to 1987, when the network debuted its first news program Noticiero Telemundo-HBC, a program produced through an outsourcing agreement with the Miami-based Hispanic-American Broadcasting Corporation that was anchored by Lana Montalban; following the program's cancellation, Montalban accepted an anchor position at the network's New York City owned-and-operated station WNJU, where she served as an anchor of its evening newscasts until 1992. The following year, on March 24, 1988, Telemundo entered into a partnership with cable news channel CNN to produce two daily newscasts, titled Noticiero Telemundo CNN (\\"Telemundo CNN News\\"); CNN took over production of the network's newscasts on May 31 of that year. In addition, CNN also produced an hour-long weekend news review program, Resumen Semanal Telemundo-CNN, and news briefs that aired five times per day for Telemundo. Produced at the CNN Center in Atlanta, the program was anchored by Jorge Gestoso and Maria Elvira Salazar. Salazar later left the program to become a reporter at rival Univision's news division Noticiero Univision; Chilean native Cecilia Bolocco, a former Miss Universe, was named as Salazar's replacement. The final incarnation produced in Atlanta was co-anchored by Patricia Janiot. In 1992, Enrique Gratas joined the network to serve as anchor of Ocurri√≥ As√≠, a nightly newsmagazine providing in-depth stories dealing with issues pertinent to U.S. Hispanics and investigative reports. In 1994, Telemundo launched its own 24-hour cable news channel, Telenoticias, which was operated as a joint venture between Argentinean television network Artear, Spain broadcaster Antena 3 and Reuters. The venture was not successful and the partners later sold the channel to CBS Cable in 1996, which rebranded the network as CBS Telenoticias and increased its distribution across North, Central and South America. Following the sale of Telenoticias to CBS, Telemundo entered into a content partnership with the channel to produce early-evening and prime time newscasts that would air on the broadcast network. CBS sold Telenoticias back to Telemundo in February 2000, after which the network was relaunched as the entertainment-based Telemundo Internacional. Noticias Telemundo was founded as an in-house network news division on August 25, 1999, under the auspices of former CBS News vice president Joe Peyronnin, who served as the Telemundo division's executive vice president until 2006. After Telemundo's agreement with CBS Telenoticias ended the day prior, the network launched two half-hour evening newscasts on January 1, 2000, the nightly general news broadcast Noticiero Telemundo, which was produced out of Telemundo's Hialeah, Florida headquarters; and the weeknight-only late news program Noticiero Telemundo Internacional (the latter program was pre-empted on many of Telemundo's news- producing O&O; stations and select affiliates, only airing on affiliates that did not operate their own news department, in the event that a station pre- empted their regular local newscasts during major national holidays or the network's national feed in markets where there was no in-market affiliate), an internationally focused news program produced out of its new bureau in Mexico City. In September 2000, the network launched a two-hour morning news program, Esta Ma√±ana, the network's first national morning show entry, hosted by Jose Diaz-Balart (who joined the network from CBS, where he anchored CBS This Morning prior to its cancellation) and former Univision anchor Gloria Calzada. Additional news programs were created by the network in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks: Buenos Dias was replaced by Hoy en el Mundo (\\"Today in the World\\") on ABC, an ABC news program focused on national and international stories anchored by Diaz-Balart and Marian de la Fuente; it also launched a companion early morning newscast Primera Hora (\\"First Hour\\"). Also in wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks Telemundo launched another news program that aired weeknights called \\"Un Nuevo Mundo, Una Nacion Unida\\" that aired at 7 P.M. that program was anchored by Pedro Sevcec and Ocurri√≥ As√≠ anchor Ana Patricia Candiani, the show replaced a weeknight novela called \\"Provacame\\" that show was rescheduled . In 2002, the network launched a late afternoon news and entertainment magazine series, similar in format to its Univision competitor Primer Impacto, Al Rojo Vivo con Maria Celeste. In 2005, Telemundo signed longtime Univision anchor Mar√≠a Antonieta Collins to a long- term contract, in which she would host a program for the network. The network then cancelled Hoy en el Mundo on ABC News and En la Madrugada, replacing them on October 10, 2005, with a news and lifestyle program titled Cada Dia with Maria Antonieta (\\"Every Day with Maria Antonieta\\"); Collins hosted the program, with Diaz-Balart serving as co-host and also serving as anchor of another early morning news program titled Noticiero Telemundo: Primera Hora (\\"Telemundo Newscast: First Hour\\"), before leaving that program and being replaced as anchor by Ana Patricia Candiani. In 2007, Telemundo discontinued the Saturday and Sunday editions of the flagship Noticiero Telemundo broadcast and Al Rojo Vivo, which were replaced with feature films and reality-based series (with the move, Univision became the only Spanish-language broadcast network to carry a weekend edition of its evening newscast and the only one carrying any non-sports news programming on weekends altogether); weekend editions of Noticiero Telemundo were restored in October 4, 2014, focusing on general news, health and consumer segments, analysis of the previous week's major stories and a preview of events occurring in the coming week (which was scheduled 90 minutes earlier than the flagship weeknight editions, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time, to accommodate the network's prime time entertainment programming). Cada Dia was cancelled in May 2008, after Collins announced that she would leave Telemundo when her contract expired in August of that year return to news anchoring and as a result of low ratings for the program;In an interview in \\"People en Espanol\\". Noticiero Telemundo: Madrugada, meanwhile, was replaced by an hour-long music and dance program that was spun off from the network's Saturday afternoon series Descontrol. The former of the two morning news shows was replaced by a new hybrid news and lifestyle program (similar in format to Univision's ¬°Despierta Am√©rica!), ¬°Lev√°ntate! (\\"Get Up\\"), which was initially broadcast and produced by out of the studios of the network's San Juan, Puerto Rico station WKAQ-TV. The hybrid program, which was retitled Un Nuevo D√≠a (\\"A New Day\\") in July 2012, originally included local participation of the network's Miami owned-and- operated station WSCV from its studios in the suburb of Miramar, Florida, and bureaus located in New York City, Los Angeles and Mexico City. The show was later revamped in February 2011, discontinuing the local cut-ins and relocating its production operations to Telemundo's headquarters in Hialeah. In 2011, Telemundo debuted a half-hour Sunday morning political and cultural affairs talk show Enfoque, hosted by Diaz-Balart, marking a restoration of weekend news programming on the network (outside of its weekend evening sports highlight program Titulares Telemundo); the program was expanded to one hour in January 2014. On July 6, 2015, Noticiero Telemundo became the first national network newscast produce an entire broadcast using mobile devices. Journalists reporting for the special \\"Digital Day\\" broadcast were equipped with smartphones and tablet computers to record and transmit stories included on the broadcast, which was also streamed on Noticiero Telemundo's Periscope account, incorporating behind-the-scenes footage of the program's anchors and reporters during breaks within the program.

The juice is obtained through a large-scale industrial cold-pressing procedure using the upper parts of the hemp plant as well as the leaves. This procedure clearly distinguishes hemp juice from other hemp products such as hemp oil, hemp sprouts or hemp milk, which are solely obtained through the seeds of the hemp plant as opposed to the green hemp leaves used for the juice. The hemp juice production therefore makes use of a valuable part of the industrial hemp plant which has previously been neglected and not been used but instead been left on the fields to decompose. In particular, hemp juice offers a base for a variety of drug-free products in the areas of nutrition, medicine, cosmetics, and relaxing beverages. Moreover, its full-bodied umami flavor offers the ability to enhance dishes and drinks in their specific flavor, especially sweet or savory and harmonizes tastes overall. Current studies point out the particularly high medical potential of the cannabinoid CBD, which is found in industrial hemp.Grotenhermen F., Berger M., Gebhardt K.  Cannabidiol (CBD) ‚Ä¢ Ein cannabishaltiges Compendium, Verlag Nachtschatten, Solothurn (Schweiz), Oktober 2015 / / \\"Website Publisher\\" Drug-free industrial hemp and the hemp juice produced from it offer the advantages of legal cultivation and utilization, as well as consumption by humans in many countries around the world. As opposed to the Cannabis Indica and Sativa plants with higher Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content which are not legal in most countries. Hemp juice is a highly suitable food product due to the high amounts of proteins it contains.Proteins in hemp: \\"Characterization, amino acid composition and in vitro digestibility of hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) proteins\\" Hemp juice and its press remnants can be used to supplement food by substituting for instance some portion of flour in bread. It can be used as a taste enhancer in any kind of dish. It can be used as food supplement in the form of freeze-dried hemp juice powder for nutritional reasons. Considering the vast advantages of cultivating hemp in comparison to other crops,Hemp Farming: \\"Article\\" hemp is a sustainable food source for the future.  Description  Hemp juice cold- pressed from industrial hemp prior to seed maturation is an emulsion. This is because at the best time of harvest for industrial fiber the green hemp also contains the special omega oils, most cannabinoids as well as the other valuable ingredients in the suspended particles. All hemp varieties with a THC content of below 0,2% classify as industrial hemp in Europe (below 0.3% in the US and Canada) and are defined as drug-free foods and therefore legal under EU, US and Canadian law.  Contents and characteristics = Content  Drug-free hemp juice contains all of the valuable ingredients of the hemp plant in their natural form and matrix. The highest content of cannabinoids and proteins can be found in the hemp plant prior to seed maturation when the hemp plant is still green. The main ingredients of hemp juice besides omega-n- fatty acids are more than 100 cannabinoids, which are being recognized by special receptors in the human body (endocannabinoid system and signal transduction). Hemp is the only botanical source of cannabinoids. Hemp juice contains many easily digestible proteins, in particular all of the eight essential amino acids important for humans.Study 2012 / Deutschen Bergischen Universit√§t Wuppertal / Charlott Dreyer: \\"Analytische Charakterisierung der Inhaltsstoffe von Hanfsaft\\" Furthermore, the juice contains a variety of minerals, vitamins and many polyphenols.  Measuring methods for contents of cannabinoids  Measuring methods for cannabinoids are based on the extraction of fluids from the hemp plant. Research and studies conducted at the University of Wuppertal (Germany) have shown that extracts contain much less of the initial contents of the hemp plant present in the juice. Besides, with extracts there is a risk of residues of solvents. There are no specific measuring methods for the quantities of cannabinoids in hemp juice accepted by all states. The EU is working on the development of a commonly accepted procedure. An alternative procedure used for the extraction of fluids first filters and centrifugesHemp juice via centrifuging - menal GmbH, Emmerdingen (Freiburg) the hemp juice. The findings however showed no traces of cannabinoids because the characteristic contents of the hemp plant solely can be found in the unfiltered hemp juice.  Flavor and Color  The juice of the uppermost parts of the plant has an intensive green color; its pure flavor is bitter ‚Äì hempy. The juice of the fibers and shives of the plant is lighter in color and tastes sweet. Hemp juice creates a distinct, full-bodied umami flavor, based on the multitude of proteins, polyphenols and cannabinoids in the hemp plant. Already small amounts of hemp juice harmonize and enhance the characteristic tastes of dishes in their own right. The bitter taste of the hemp juice is transformed into a fresh and sweet flavor after mixing it with vegetable or fruit juices. Moreover, the original fruit or vegetable flavor is intensified by the cannabinoids in the hemp.Talavera K, Yasumatsu K, Yoshida R, Margolskee RF, Voets T, Ninomiya Y & Nilius B. (2008). The taste transduction channel TRPM5 is a locus for bitter-sweet taste interactions.

The lower part of the plant remains on the field to rot for fabric production. Hemp juice is produced in a patentedPatents for cold pressing juice from industrial hemp and for producing beverages and products from this juice: \\"Patents\\" industrial procedure directly following harvest whereby the leafy upper part of the plant, including the flower heads, are being cold-pressed after harvest. These parts of the hemp plant have been entirely neglected so far in industrial hemp fabric production. Hence, through the procedure of pressing juice, a previously neglected highly valuable part of the plant is now being used for human consumption. All active ingredients remain fully intact without drying the hemp. The juice does not compete with the production of fibers and shives instead both add up to double revenue of the farmer. The average yield of hemp juice is approximately 3 tons per ha. This newly developed production procedure allows for a significantly higher financial efficiency as well as sustainability in the cultivation of drug-free industrial hemp. Furthermore, the cold-pressing procedure preserves all of the plant-based active ingredients. There are two common harvesting procedures: \\"Cutting\\" the upper parts of the hemp plant or \\"stripping\\" the leaves off the uppermost part of the hemp plant. Both these procedures result in varying quantities of cannabinoids in the hemp juice. Consequently, the harvesting procedure in itself already influences the quality of the resulting hemp juice. If one only uses the uppermost, leafy part of the hemp plant for the hemp juice production the entire remaining part of the hemp plant can still be used for the industrial production of fibers or any other industrial uses. Subsequently, the juice production creates a significant additional financial gain without compromising the fiber production in any way. In climate zones in which hemp seeds do not ripen easily such as Northern Europe, the juice production represents and additional utilization of the hemp plant. Additionally to hemp juice, press remnants of approximately 3 tons per ha are being gained. A quarter to a third of the ingredients found in hemp juice are present in the press remnants. These constitute a valuable food part for humans as well for instance used to bake bread. They also can be dried or fermented and used as cattle feed. On top of this, cold-pressing the fibers and shives offers an additional added value of the plant. It is also possible with a suitable pressing procedure during harvest to press the juice of the entire hemp plant. The use of the fiber in industry is not necessarily compromised if the right pressing process is chosen. The resulting juice of the hemp stem represents an additional value added. It can be used for bio-gas production of energy or in fermenting lactic acid for the chemical industry. Cold-pressing the fibers and shives does not compromise their value for further industrial processing.  Juice content  The juice content of the plant varies depending on the age of the plant. Younger plants contain more juice than older ones. The plant provides the least juice after seed maturation because the leaves have already begun decay at that point. Depending on the kind of press used, the amount of resulting juice varies significantly. On average 50% of the weight of the plant is obtained as juice. The water to dry matter ratio of the juice shows high dry matter content in the upper part of the plant, and is lowest in the leaves when the seeds are ripe. The dry matter content is medium in the fibers and lowest in the shives. The relatively high content of dry matter implies a high percentage of substance components such as carbohydrates, amino acids, protein, fat, cannabinoids, polyphenols, as well as other substrates.  Partial harvest  This procedure allows for the harvest of leaves for hemp juice as well as hemp seeds from the same field in areas where the climate is suitable. This procedure starts a few weeks after sowing, with the harvest of the leafy tops only. As a consequence, the plant grows new tops which will be multiply leafy tops in most cases and they can be harvested later on. If the plant grows on until seeds are ripe, hemp seeds can be harvested. Thus, harvest for juice and harvest for seeds are both possible. Partial harvest can help to increase the seed crop.  Storability and stability  Hemp juice freeze-dried The preferred procedure is to freeze the freshly cold-pressed juice instantly for preservation. The quality of the juice depends on immediate freezing. The frozen juice can be freeze-dried into a storable powder. Freezing and freeze-drying stabilize the natural form of the cannabinoids as cannabinoid-acids. Another procedure is pasteurization. The ultra-heat-treatment will \\"activate\\" the cannabinoids by separating the acid part from the natural cannabinoids. Increasing shelf life of hemp juice can also be achieved by fermentation, using various procedures, preferably by adding yeast/yeast extract and sugar. Using salt is a proven procedure to achieve storability in foods. With regard to hemp juice this can be done by mixing salt with fresh hemp juice, which leads to an easily usable product: \\"hemp salt\\".  Use  The juice is drinkable, yet not palatable in its pure form due to its bitter taste. The bitterness diminishes as soon as the hemp juice is mixed with fruit or vegetable juices. The hemp juice simultaneously heightens the fruity, savory and sweet taste of juices and foods in general. Therefore, it is recommended to use hemp juice in drinks, foods, seasoning, food supplements, medical products as well as cosmetics. The press remnants can also be used as food supplements.  Differentiation  Hemp juice can be clearly distinguished from other liquid products of the hemp plant. Hemp milk and hemp oil, just like soy milk, are produced from the seeds of the plant. Beverages such as hemp beer use the dried flowers or dried leaves of the plant. When dried parts of hemp are used in water and extract results. Water extraction only contains a proportion of about 10% of hemp ingredients otherwise found in cold-pressed juice. Therefore, cold-pressed hemp juice contains a much higher percentage of valuable ingredients. More importantly, water extraction does not contain any of the important cannabinoids as they cling to the fatty acids of the plant, which are not dissolved in water extraction. Yet, cold-pressed hemp juice does contain the valuable cannabinoids. These valuable ingredients are also preserved when hemp is juiced in a conventional home blender. This process of juicing is not suitable for industrial hemp because the plant fibers used for industrial applications are too hard to digest for humans.  Beverages  Hemp juice can be used for mixed non-alcoholic drinks or as a base for alcoholic drinks. The juice is particularly suited for relaxing soft drinks due to its calming effects. For instance: * As iced-tea mix * As fermented mix without alcohol (vegetable or fruit juice) * As a supplement for vegetable or fruit juices to intensify the sweet flavor, to increase the nutritional value, as well as to create the full-bodied umami taste * Light or dark hemp drink without alcohol similar to beer * As a distilled hard liquor such as hemp spirit * As herb liqueur or bitter using alcohol and sugar in the production process * As a mixer for alcoholic drinks such as cocktails * As a brewing ingredient for hemp beer * As a base for gluten-free beer Gluten-free hemp beer does not require malt or cereal mash and it is low in calories. Hemp as a close relative of hops provides the fine and bitter beer taste even without using any hops.  Seasoning  It is not the taste of the hemp juice itself but the way it intensifies the flavor of dishes that makes hemp juice useful as seasoning. Hemp juice can reduce salt and sugar use in foods considerably without sacrificing taste.Thomas Voet, Modulation of Temperature-Sensitive TRP Channels (2014), 24. Annual Symposium of the International Cannabinoid Research Society, International Cannabinoid Research Society, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA, Page N2 * Hemp Microgreens Powder works well as a seasoning on salads, in smoothies or just mixed in pure water. * Hemp salt: Hemp juice is mixed and dried with good quality table salt. It can be used for cooked as well as uncooked dishes. Henceforth, cannabinoids are consumed in their natural cannabinoid-acid form as well as in their activated form. Hemp salt helps reduce salt intake due to its natural effect of intensifying flavors. * Hemp sugar or hemp syrup: Hemp juice can lower sugar intake when consumed in combination with fruit juices, sweet dishes, or sugar because it intensifies sweet flavors significantly. * Hemp juice and its umami flavor enhance the savory taste of any dish and is suitable for use in mixing, cooking, baking, ready meals, beverages, seasoning, pastries, jams, and soups (Siemieniotka).  Food supplement  The valuable cannabinoids, proteins, vitamins, minerals, polyphenols, and poly-unsaturated fatty acids are useful to prevent deficiencies and aid muscle growth. Athletes for instance use protein powder made from hemp. Hemp juice offers a natural alternative to the industrially produced hemp protein.German Organisation for hemp protein: \\"hanfprotein.org (German Site)\\" Even the dietary fibers in the press remnants can be used for food supplements if fermented. Finely ground hemp press remnants can substitute some portion of flour in bread recipes with yeast.  Medicine (pharmaceutical)  Cannabis has been used in traditional medicine over centuries. Today, cannabis is subjected to medical research mostly concentrating on the cannabinoids THC and CBD.Grotenhermen F., M√ºller-Vahl K. ‚Ä¢ The therapeutic potential of cannabis and cannabinoids. / Deutsches √Ñrzteblatt Int. 2012 July / 109(29-30):495-501. / \\"U.S. National Library of Medicine\\" The cannabis varieties used for the production of the hemp juice such as cannabis sativa are high in CBD content. Hemp juice can also be added into cr√®mes and gels, and used as an eczema treatment.  Additive for cosmetics  The juice can be used in skin cr√®mes due to its high polyphenol, vitamin and protein content. Hemp salt unfolds its soothing effect on neurodermatitis as a bath additive.

CALET is an astrophysics mission that searches for signatures of dark matter and provides the highest energy direct measurements of the cosmic ray electron spectrum in order to observe discrete sources of high- energy particle acceleration in our local region of the galaxy.CALET aboard the ISS Kibo Started the First Direct Electron Observation in Tera Electron Volt Region. JAXA Press Release. 22 October 2015. The mission was developed and sponsored by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), involving teams from Japan, Italy, and the United States. It seeks to understand the mechanisms of particle acceleration and propagation of cosmic rays in our galaxy, to identify their sources of acceleration, their elemental composition as a function of energy, and possibly to unveil the nature of dark matter. Such sources seem to be able to accelerate particles to energies far higher than scientists can achieve on Earth using the largest accelerators. Understanding how nature does this is important to space travel and has possible applications here on Earth. The CALET Principal Investigator is Shoji Torii from the Waseda University, Japan; John Wefel is the co-principal investigator for the US team; Pier S. Marrocchesi, is the co-investigator from the Italy team. Unlike optical telescopes, CALET operates in a scanning mode. It records each cosmic ray event that enters its field of view and triggers its detectors to take measurements of the cosmic ray in the extremely high energy region of teraelectronvolts (TeV, one trillion electronvolts). These measurements are recorded on the space station and sent to a ground station at Louisiana State University for analyses.CALET USA. Louisiana State University (2015).

Many Plato interpreters held that his writings contain passages with double meanings, called 'allegories' or 'symbols', that give the dialogues layers of figurative meaning in addition to their usual literal meaning. These allegorical interpretations of Plato were dominant for more than fifteen hundred years, from about the first century CE through the Renaissance and into the Eighteenth Century, and were advocated by major figures such as Plotinus, Proclus, and Ficino. Beginning with Philo of Alexandria (1st c. CE), these views influenced Jewish, Christian and Islamic interpretation of their holy scriptures. They spread widely in the Renaissance and contributed to the fashion for allegory among poets such as Dante, Spenser, and Shakespeare.For Ficino's influence on Spenser and Shakespeare, see Sears Jayne, 'Ficino and the Platonism of the English Renaissance,' Comparative Literature, v. 4, no. 3, 1952, pp. 214-238. In the early modern period, classical scholarship rejected claims that Plato was an allegorist. After this rupture, the ancient followers of Plato who read the dialogues as sustained allegories were labelled 'Neo-Platonists' and regarded as an aberration. In the wake of Tate's pioneering 1929 article 'Plato and Allegorical Interpretation',J. Tate, Classical Quarterly, v. 23, no. 3-4, p. 142 ff. scholars began to study the allegorical approach to Plato in its own right both as essential background to Plato studies and as an important episode in the history of philosophy, literary criticism, hermeneutics, and literary symbolism. Historians have come to reject any simple division between Platonism and Neo-Platonism, and the tradition of reading Plato allegorically is now an area of active research.For a brief but general overview of the history of allegory, see Luc Brisson, How Philosophers Saved Myths: Allegorical Interpretation and Classical Mythology (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2004). Translated by Catherine Tihanyi. The definitions of 'allegory', 'symbolism', and 'figurative meaning' evolved over time. The word 'allegory' (Greek for 'saying other') became more frequent in the early centuries CE and referred to language that had some other meaning in addition to its usual or literal meaning. Earlier in classical Athens, it was common instead to speak of 'undermeanings' (Gk., hyponoiai), which referred to hidden or deeper meanings.Plutarch says \\"allegories ... which the ancients called undermeanings\\" in an essay in the Moralia: De Audiendis Poetis, 4.19. Plato (Rep. II. 378d), Euripides (Phoenicians 1131-33), Aristophanes (Frogs 1425-31), Xenophon (Symposium III, 6), all use hyponoia to mean what is later subsumed under allegory. See Jean P√©pin, Mythe et All√©gorie (Paris: Etudes Augustiniennes, 1976), pp. 85-86. Today, allegory is often said to be a sustained sequence of metaphors within a literary work, but this was not clearly the ancient definition since then a single passage or even a name could be allegorical. Generally, the changing meanings of such terms must be studied within each historical context.P. Struck, Birth of the Symbol (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2004).  Allegory within Plato's dialogues  Greek allegory arguably began with personifications in Greek mythology (Eros is love, Athena is wisdom). Greek philosophical allegory may have begun with Parmenides or Empedocles but is clear in Socrates' friend, Prodicus the Sophist, and his famous tale of 'Hercules at the Crossroads'. Discussed by Xenophon, the Neo-Platonists, and many others, it became well-known again in the Middle Ages and Renaissance.See Xenophon, Memorabilia (2.1.21‚Äì34) and Robert Mayhew, Prodicus the Sophist: Text, Translation, and Commentary (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012). On the left, Virtue is calling Hercules to the higher path of glory through hardship, while Vice is enticing him toward the easy life of pleasure (Annibale Carracci, The Choice of Hercules, detail, 1596, National Museum of Capodimonte). Papirus Oxyrhynchus, with fragment of Plato's Republic As a young man, Plato encountered debates in the circles around Anaxagoras and Socrates over whether Homer's poems contained allegories.For Anaxagoras and Metrodorus, see Diogenes Laertius, II.1 and Plato's 'Ion,' 530c3-d3. For Antisthenes the Cynic, see the discussion in R. Pfeiffer,History of Classical Scholarship: from the beginnings to the end of the Hellenistic Age (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1968), p. 36. See Robert Lamberton, Homer the Theologian: Neoplatonist Allegorical Reading and the Growth of the Epic Tradition (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1989). Plato refers to these debates and made allegories and the nature of allegory a prominent theme in his dialogues.According to Plato's dialogue the 'Cratylus,' most interpreters at that time treated Homer allegorically. Socrates says 'Indeed, even the ancients seem to think about Athena just as those who are currently skilled concerning Homer do. For the majority of these in interpreting the poet say that he has made out Athena to be mind and thought' (407a8-b2). He uses many allegorical devices and explicitly calls attention to them. In the Parable of the Cave, for example, Plato tells a symbolic tale and interprets its elements one by one (Rep., 514a1 ff.). In the Phaedrus, Socrates criticizes those who offer rationalizing, allegorical explanations for myths (229c6 ff.). Plato's own views on allegorical interpretation, or 'allegoresis', have long been debated. Ford concluded that: > Allegoresis is viewed by Plato as an uncertain method and dangerous where > children are concerned, but he never denies outright the possibility of its > being used in a more philosophical way. In the passage rejecting allegory > from the Republic (378d), the reasons are primarily pedagogical and social > rather than theological or methodological... Plato's disquiet is focused on > popularisers of subtle interpretation, not on the method itself ...A. L. > Ford, The Origins of Criticism: literary culture and poetic theory in > classical Greece (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2002, p. 86-7. The core of Plato's philosophy is the Theory of Forms (or Ideas), and many writers have seen in this metaphysical theory a justification for the use of literary allegory. Fletcher, for example, wrote: > The Platonic theory of ideas has two aspects which lead to allegorical > interpretations of both signs and things ... To speak of \\"the idea of a > thing\\" is almost to invoke the allegorical process, for the idea transcends > the thing, much as the allegorist's fiction departs from the literal sense > of an utterance... More important is the Platonic arrangement of the theory > of ideas as a vast hierarchical construct, from lower to higher forms... By > questioning the essential value of material nature, the Platonic dialectic > opens the way to a spiritualizing of nature, and in the case of Plato > himself this leads to the use of allegory precisely at the moment in his > dialogues when the analysis of nature has reached the highest point of > transcendence describable in natural, human terms.Angus Fletcher, 'Allegory > in Literary History,' in Dictionary of the History of Ideas online at > http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=DicHist/uvaBook/tei/DicHist1.xml&query;=Dictionary%20of%20the%20History%20of%20Ideas, > pp. 43-44. See also A. Fletcher, Allegory: The Theory of a Symbolic Mode > (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2012). Many believe Plato was influenced by the Pythagoreans. Like other ancient sects, they were reputed to have secret doctrines and secret rituals.Walter Burkert, Lore and Science in Ancient Pythagoreanism (Cambridge: Harverd University Press, 1972) and W. Burkert, Ancient Mystery Cults (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1987). Ancient writers, however, especially associated them with 'symbols' used to conceal their secrets.This late reputation for secrecy is already attested in the fourth century by Aristotle (in Iamblichus, Vit. Pit., 6) and by his sometime student Aristoxenus (D. L. 8.15-16). See also Burkert, op. cit., 1972, p. 179, cf. n. 96. In ancient Greek, the word 'symbol' originally meant the broken half of some small object which two parties split apart in order to use the matching pieces as proofs of identity. The Pythagoreans seemed to extend the meaning of this term to include short phrases that played the role of secret passwords or answered ritualized riddles. Struck traces the way this usage was further stretched to encompass literary symbolism and thus why the Pythagoreans are sometimes credited with inventing such symbolism.Peter T. Struck, Birth of the Symbol: Ancient Readers at the Limits of Their Texts (Princeton: University Press, 2004).  Plato's early interpreters  Within the Academy, a famous dispute over the creation myth in Plato's Timaeus shows that some of Plato's earliest followers were not reading the dialogues literally: Speusippus, Xenocrates, and Polemo all interpreted a key passage in the Timaeus figuratively.For a brief, recent overview, see Tarrant, 'Platonic Interpretation and Eclectic Theory,' in Tarrant and Baltzly, Plato's Early Interpreters (Duckworth, 2006), p. 10. After Aristotle left the Academy and founded his own school, he did not seem to share the ambivalence toward allegoresis expressed in Plato's dialogues.As emphasized by P√©pin, op. cit., p. 121 ff. (with references to earlier debates), Brisson, op. cit., p. 38 ff., and others. He regarded the ancient Greek myths, for example, as allegorical expressions of philosophical truths: > An inheritance has been handed down from the most ancient to later times in > the form of a myth, that there are gods and that the divine surrounds all of > nature. The rest [of the ancient stories] were expressed mythically, which > is appropriate for convincing uneducated people ... They even said the gods > had human shapes and were similar to the other animals ... If the first > [claim], that they believed the gods are fundamental realities, is taken > separately [from the mythic stories], then they surely spoke an inspired > truth ... (Met. 1074a38 ‚Äì b13). Yet when Aristotle discussed passages in Plato's dialogues he interpreted them literally.See, for example, the extensive discussions of Plato's Republic in Aristotle's Politics. Aristotle's writings are hostile to Pythagoreanism and generally to unclear words in public speeches. For criticism of the Pythagoreans see, e.g., book II of De Caelo; for his contrast between clear speech, metaphors, and enigmas, see On Rhetoric, III.2). Aristotle shows either that Plato's immediate students usually read the dialogues literally or that Aristotle himself was never initiated into the Pythagorean sect and thus missed the allegories later readers found in the dialogues. In the two centuries following Plato's death in 347 BCE, there was sustained interest in Plato's philosophy but little surviving evidence of careful efforts among his early followers to interpret the dialogues (these do not, of course, purport to give Plato's own views). The first generations of 'dogmatists' after Plato in the early Academy were generally concerned with Plato's doctrines, arguments, and problems, but not with detailed readings of Plato's texts. Apparently no commentaries on the dialogues were written in the early Academy until Crantor (died about 290 BCE).Dillon accepts the view of Proclus (In Tim. I 76, 1-2) that Crantor '... perhaps makes his most distinctive contribution to the history of Platonism, the idea of a commentary' (Dillon, Heirs of Plato (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2003), p. 218). The dogmatists were followed by 'skeptics' who interpreted the dialogues primarily as professions of Socratic ignorance.R. J. Hankinson, The Skeptics (New York: Routledge, 1995), ch. V. D√∂rrie points out that the notion of comprehensively interpreting Plato's texts had not yet emerged: > ... the hermeneutical question [of how to interpret Plato's texts] was not > posed ... Today, the demand that an interpretation must set out from an > evaluation of the entirety (des gesamten Habitus) of a text would appear > obvious and even banal. However, even in modern philology, this demand was > first recognized as valid in the last two or at most three generations... > D√∂rrie, Von Platon zum Platonismus (D√ºsseldorf: Westdeutscher Verlag, 1975), > pp. 35, 42, surveys and periodizes the various ancient approaches to Plato's > dialogues. See also references below. The allegorical turn: Neo-Pythagoreanism  As interest in Plato spread from Athens to Alexandria and other cities across the Mediterranean, there was a turn from the doctrines espoused by the Academy toward the direct reading of the dialogues themselves. From this period onwards, the allegorical approach to reading Plato increasingly became the norm. This historic shift coincided with the resurgence of interest in Pythagoreanism about the first century BCE. See Burkert, op. cit. Neo-Pythagoreans such as Numenius soon began claiming that Pythagorean doctrines were symbolically embedded in Plato's dialogues.See esp. H. Tarrant, 'The Phaedo in Numenian Allegorical Interpretation,' in S. Delcomminette et al., Ancient Readings of Plato's Phaedo (Leiden: Brill, 2015), pp. 135‚Äì153. One of Numenius' works was entitled On the Disagreement of the Academics with Plato and another On the Secrets or Reserved Doctrines in Plato.des Places, Numenius (Paris: Les belles Lettres, 1973). Tarrant summarized the views of the Neo-Pythagoreans, saying that they believed (italics original): > ... that Pythagorean doctrines are hidden in Plato, who for one reason or > another is reluctant to reveal them, and that true Pythagoreanism can be > teased out of Platonic texts by in-depth interpretation... it would seem > safe to say that something quite esoteric is regularly being detected > beneath Plato's text, concealing details of the allegedly Pythagorean > metaphysic that Pythagoreans, almost as a matter of faith, supposed to exist > there.H. Tarrant, Plato's First Interpreters (London: Duckworth, 2000), pp. > 84 ‚Äì 85. Middle Platonism is sometimes thought to have avoided allegorical interpretation, but Dillon's survey found 'relative continuity' with the later Neo-Platonists: 'at least at the latter end of the Middle Platonic period, there were developments in exegesis which anticipated to some extent the allegorizing of the Neo-Platonists.'John Dillon, 'Pedantry and Pedestrianism? Some Reflections on the Middle Platonic Commentary Tradition,' in H. Tarrant and D. Baltzly, Reading Plato in Antiquity (London: Duckworth, 2006), p. 24. The routine attribution of hidden meanings to Plato among Middle Platonists can be found, for example, in Plutarch (c. 45 ‚Äì 125 CE), a priest of the Elysian mysteries and perhaps a Platonic successor.See, for example, in Plutarch, Isis and Osiris, p. 370 ff.; cf. H. Tarrant, Plato's First Interpreters, op. cit., p. 24.  Dominance of the allegorical Plato: Neo- Platonism  The earliest depiction of a Roman book cabinet or armarium, with scrolls inside on the upper shelf. From a sarcophagus dated to 200‚Äì300 CE, i.e, about the time Plotinus was in Rome. Though found in Ostia, a port near Rome, the Greek inscription suggests a Greek resident. The open case containing surgical tools on the cabinet top, the other scrolls, and a basin for bleeding patients within the cabinet suggest a learned physician (Metropolitan Museum of Art, N.Y., 48.76.1). Modern historians call the followers of Plato in the early centuries CE 'Neo-Platonists.' They were the most important and vigorous advocates of the allegorical interpretation of Plato. Plotinus, regarded as the founder of Neo-Platonism, often says that Plato's dialogues have 'undermeanings' (hyponoiai). See his Enneads: IV 2,2; vi 8 22; vi 8 19, iii 4 5; iii 7 13. See also Jean-Michel Charrue, Plotin, Lecteur de Platon (Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1978). His Ennead III.5 is an extended allegorical interpretation of passages from Plato's Symposium. Surviving commentaries on Plato's dialogues by Neo-Platonists such as Proclus contain extended allegorical interpretations.For a discussion of Proclus' use of allegory, see ch. 4 of A. Sheppard, Studies of the Fifth and Sixth Essays of Proclus' Commentary on the Republic (G√∂ttingen: Vandenhoeck and Ruprecht, 1980). Proclus' commentary on Plato's Parmenides says, for example, that the narrator Antiphon could not have been ignorant of the dialogue's 'secret' or 'deeper meanings' (682). Page references are to the 1864 edition of Cousin. Translations are from G. R. Marrow and J. Dillon, Proclus' Commentary on Plato's Parmenides (Princeton: University Press, 1992). Proclus himself see the dialogue's characters as symbols of metaphysical principles: Parmenides is a representation of the divine, Zeno of the Intellect, and Socrates of the particular Intellect (628). Proclus argues generally that: > Writings of a genuinely profound and theoretical character ought not to be > communicated except with the greatest caution and considered judgement, lest > we inadvertently expose to the slovenly hearing and neglect of the public > the inexpressible thoughts of god-like souls (718, cf. 1024). Proclus claims that the Parmenides generally communicates its meaning through allegory or undermeanings.For a discussion of Proclus' use of allegory in Plato's Parmenides see A teacher, he says, does not 'speak clearly, but will content himself with indications; for one should express mystical truths mystically and not publicize secret doctrines about the gods' (928). The dialogue's method of instruction is 'to employ symbols and indications and riddles, a method proper to the most mystical of doctrines ...' (1027). A late neo-Platonist, Macrobius shows that in the fifth century CE allegorical interpretations of Plato were routine: > That is why Plato, when he was moved to speak about the Good, did not dare > to tell what it was ... philosophers make use of fabulous narratives > (fabulosa); not without a purpose, however, nor merely to entertain, but > because they realize that a frank and naked (apertam nudamque) exposition of > herself is distasteful to Nature, who, just as she has withheld an > understanding of herself from the uncouth sense of men by enveloping herself > in variegated garments, has also desired to have her secrets handled by more > prudent individuals through fabulous narratives... Only eminent men of > superior intelligence gain a revelation of her truths ... (I.17-18).  Effects on Jewish, Christian, and Islamic Hermeneutics  In the Hellenistic period (3rd ‚Äì 1st centuries BCE) allegorical interpretation was predominately a Greek technique associated with interpreters of Homer, the Stoics, and finally Plato. Philo of Alexandria (c. 25 BCE ‚Äì c. 50 CE), a Jewish scholar with a Greek education, systematically applied the allegorical approach to the Jewish scriptures. This had far-reaching consequences for later controversies over methods for interpreting the Christian Bible and these in turn set the stage for the modern rejection of allegorical interpretations of Plato. Philo of Alexandria believed that the doctrines in Plato's dialogues and Jewish scriptures (the Torah) were so similar that Plato must have borrowed his philosophy from the Jews. Philo held that, before Plato wrote his dialogues, he must have traveled to Egypt and studied the teachings of the Jewish prophet Moses. Philo's wide-ranging, allegorical re- interpretations of Jewish scripture even found evidence that Plato's Theory of Forms was known centuries before Plato. Philo's theories had little immediate effect upon Jewish theologians, who seem never to have mentioned him or his voluminous writings.For the above, see Ilaria L. E. Ramelia, ·æΩPhilo as Origen's Declared Model: Allegorical and Historical Exegesis of Scripture,·æΩ Studies in Christian-Jewish Relations, n. 7, 2012, pp. 1-17. For Philo's relations to Plato, see the writings of David T. Runia, esp. Philo of Alexandria and The \\"Timaeus\\" of Plato (Leiden: Brill, 1986).

Origen (184/185 ‚Äì 253/254 CE) was 'the major scripture scholar in early Christianity ...'Ewert Cousins, The Fourfold Sense of Scripture in Christian Mysticism, in Steven T. Katzin, ed., Mysticism and Sacred Scripture (Oxford: University Press, 2000), p. 119. He adopted and extended the approach of Philo of Alexandria, and applied allegorical interpretation to the books of the Christian New Testament. Origen spent the first half of his career in Alexandria and knew Plato's writings well. Ramelli summarizes the relation between Philo and Origen: > Allegory was a powerful tool that allowed Philo to interpret [Jewish] > Scripture in the light of Platonism... Origen tends expressly to refer to > Philo as a predecessor precisely in points that are crucial to his > Scriptural allegorical method. This strongly suggests that Philo was his > main inspirer for the very technique of philosophical allegoresis of > Scripture, and that Origen both was well aware of this and acknowledged his > debt... Philo was the first systematic philosophical interpreter of the > Bible who read it allegorically, and Origen was the first, and the greatest, > who did so in Christianity. Ramelia, ·æΩPhilo as Origen's Declared Model: > Allegorical and Historical Exegesis of Scripture,·æΩ op. cit., p. 5. Although Origen was a controversial figure, his influence on other, major Christian theologians such as Eusebius, Gregory of Nyssa, Ambrose, and Jerome was 'wide and deep.'Frederic W. Farrar, History of Interpretation (London: Macmillan, 1886), p. 201 ff. Origen held that passages in the Bible had a literal sense and, in addition, two allegorical senses. This was later broadened, especially by the medieval Scholastics, into the famous doctrine that Biblical passages had a 'fourfold sense' ‚Äì the literal, moral, allegorical, and anagogical. Lubac, in his three-volume work on the history of this technique, said 'the doctrine of the \\"fourfold sense,\\" which had, from the dawn of the Middle Ages, been at the heart of [Biblical] exegesis, kept this role right to the end.'Henri de Lubac, published in English as Medieval Exegesis: The Four Senses of Scripture (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1998). See also Farrar, op. cit., p. 294 ff. Protestants later complained that the Roman Catholic Church used allegory to make the Bible mean whatever it desired and thus to buttress the authority of the Church: > To maintain the fourfold sense was for mediaeval Romanism [that is, the > Catholic Church] a matter of life and death. It was necessary for her power > that dogmatic prepossession and traditional authority should reign supreme. > The more ingeniously texts were manipulated in her interests, the more > loudly she proclaimed that such interpretations alone were \\"spiritual \\" and > were due to \\"illuminating grace.\\"Farrar, p. 299, cf. pp. 296‚Äì300. In sum, the techniques of allegorical interpretation applied to Plato's dialogues became central to the European tradition of reading both philosophical and ‚Äì after Philo's intervention ‚Äì religious texts. The degree to which Neo-Platonism and its allegorical methods influenced Muslim tradition is controversial and different scholars have different views. It is clear that the writings of Plotinus, Proclus, and other Neo-Platonists were translated into Arabic from an early date.Majid Fakhry, 'Philosophy and Theology: from the Eighth Century CE to the Present,' in J. L. Esposito, ed., The Oxford History of Islam (Oxford University Press, 2000), pp. 271‚Äì3. See also Dimitri Gutas, Greek Thought, Arabic Culture: The Graeco-Arabic Translation Movement in Baghdad and Early Abbasaid Society (London: Routledge, 1998). Blending with local traditions, allegory and allegorical interpretation thereafter became central to Muslim philosophy, theology, and literature. To varying degrees, they influenced Muslim philosophical theologians such as Al-Kindi (d. c. 866), Al-Farabi (c. 870 ‚Äì 950), Avicenna (980‚Äì1037), and Averroes (1126‚Äì1198).For an overview see Fakhry, p. 269 ff. or Parviz Morewedge, ed., Neoplatonism and Islamic Thought (Albany: SUNY, 1992). On the other hand, some verses in the Qur'an are regarded as allegorical and some see this as an early endorsement of allegory.Peter Heath, 'Allegory in Islamic Literatures,' Cambridge Companion to Allegory (Cambridge University Press, ), p. 82. See also Mehdi Aminrazavi, 'Mysticism in Arabic and Islamic Philosophy', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/arabic-islamic- mysticism/ A. L.

Some Islamic sects, such as Sufism, are largely based on allegorical interpretation of the Qur'an. Kristin Sands, Sufi Commentaries on the Qur'an in Classical Islam (London: Routledge, 2006).  Renewed dominance of the allegorical Plato in the Renaissance: Ficino  Botticelli's Primavera (detail, c. 1482). Florentine painters led the Renaissance shift from religious to pagan, allegorical themes. Lorenzo de' Medici was the patron of both Botticelli and Ficino, and extant letters suggest Ficino may have been consulted about the subjects of Botticelli's paintings. Though almost all of Plato's dialogues were unavailable in Western Europe during the Middle Ages, Neo-Platonism and its allegorical philosophy became well-known through various channels: > All mediaeval thought up to the twelfth century was Neoplatonic rather than > Aristotelian; and such popular authors of the Middle Ages as Augustine, > Boethius, and the Pseudo-Dionysius carried Christian Neoplatonism to England > as they did to all other parts of Western Europe.Sears Jayne, 'Ficino and > the Platonism of the English Renaissance,' Comparative Literature, vol. 4, > no. 3, 1952, pp. 214-238. From the Twelfth Century, the works of Aristotle became increasingly available and his philosophy came to dominate late medieval Scholasticism. Plato's dialogues were preserved in the Byzantine Empire and Latin translations of individual dialogues began to appear in Italy early in the Renaissance. Marsilio Ficino (1433 ‚Äì 1499) published the first complete translation in 1484 and this rapidly spread direct knowledge of Plato throughout Western Europe: > Their publication ... was an intellectual event of the first magnitude since > they established Plato as a newly discovered authority for the Renaissance > who could now take precedence over Aristotle, and whose work ... was of > sufficient profundity to be set above his rival's.M. Allen and M. Ficino, > Commentaries on Plato: Phaedrus and Ion (Cambridge: Harvard University > Press, 2008), v. I, p. xxiii. Ficino's translations helped make Renaissance Platonism into 'an attacking progressive force besieging the conservative cultural fortress which defended the Aristotelianism of the Schoolmen ... the firmest support of the established order.'F. Novotny, The Posthumous Life of Plato (The Hague: Marinus Nijhoff, 1977), p. 408. Ficino's commentaries and translations ensured that the Neo-Platonist, allegorical approach to Plato became the norm throughout Western Europe. Ficino was reading Neo-Platonists such as Proclus as early as the 1460s.M. Allen and M. Ficino, Commentaries on Plato: Phaedrus and Ion (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2008), v. I, p. xiv. As Hankins said, Ficino, 'like the [neo-Platonic] allegorists believed that Plato had employed allegory as a device for hiding esoteric doctrines from the vulgar ...'James Hankins, Plato in the Italian Renaissance, p. 345. (Leiden: Brill, 1990). His commentary on Plato's Phaedrus, for example, forthrightly interprets passages allegorically and acknowledges his debts to ancient Neo- Platonists: Bust of Marsilio Ficino in the cathedral in Florence (by A. Ferrucci, 1521). He seems to play his translation of Plato like a lyre. > The fable of the cicadas (230c) demands that we treat it as an allegory > since higher things too, like poetic ones, are almost all allegorical... > Thus it seemed to the Platonists, not only to [Neo-Platonists such as] > Hermias but to Iamblichus too. In part, I follow in their footsteps, but in > part I walk a crooked line based on probability and reason. Socrates > himself, moreover, obviously feels the need for allegory here ...M. Allen > and M. Ficino, Commentaries on Plato: Phaedrus and Ion (Cambridge: Harvard > University Press, 2008), v. I, p. 171. Ficino's Christian, Neoplatonic and allegorical reading of Plato 'tended to shape the accepted interpretation of these works from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century.'W. R. Albury, Castiglione's Allegory: Veiled Policy in The Book of the Courtier (London: Ashgate Publishing, 2008), p. 169.  The literalist turn: from Luther to Brucker  In the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Century, the Protestant Reformation and the religious wars that devastated much of Western Europe were in significant part about religious authority and therefore about how to interpret the Bible. Protestants charged that many Catholic traditions and doctrines (even the dogma that God was a Trinity) had no basis in the Gospels; Catholics asserted an expertise in reading the Bible that gave them special access to its deeper truths. The ancient technique of allegorical interpretation, the mainstay of Catholic exegesis, thus became a fiercely contested political issue. This controversy came later to transform the way Plato was read. Martin Luther's famous slogan 'scripture alone' (sola scriptura) implied the text of the Bible could be read by itself without the Catholic Church's elaborate traditions of allegoresis. Together with other leading figures in the Reformation, For the views of Protestant historians, see Farrer's The History of Interpretation, op. cit., and A. S. Wood, Captive to the Word: Martin Luther, doctor of sacred scripture (Exeter: Paternoster Press, 1969), pp. 164-5. Luther therefore attacked and rejected Catholic allegoresis: > ... the most valuable of Luther's hermeneutical principles [was] his > insistence on the primacy of the literal or grammatico-historical sense. He > resolutely set aside the verbal legerdemain involved in the multiple > exegesis of the Schoolmen, and firmly took his stand on the plain and > obvious meaning of the Word... he emphatically urged the priority and > superiority of the literal sense. For a thousand years the Church had > buttressed its theological edifice by means of an authoritative exegesis > which depended on allegory as its chief medium of interpretation. Luther > struck a mortal blow at this vulnerable spot. From his own experience in the > monastery he knew the futility of allegorisation ‚Äì and stigmatised it as > \\"mere jugglery,\\" \\"a merry chase.\\" \\"monkey tricks,\\" and \\"looney talk.\\"Wood, > op. cit., 164-5. Catholics responded at the Council of Trent that only the Church and its traditions could authoritatively interpret the meaning of the Bible. The European wars of religion (16th ‚Äì 17th c.) were in part about religious authority and whose interpretation of the Bible was legitimate, and thus allegory became a political issue. In just the Thirty Years War (1618‚Äì1648) there were perhaps five to ten million casualties and the German population was reduced in some regions by 25 to 40 percent. Depiction of the Battle of White Mountain, one of the decisive battles of the Thirty Years War, by Pieter Snayers (1620, Bayerisches Armeemuseum, Ingolstadt). Protestant scholars began critical studies of the text of the Greek New Testament that led to a re- appraisal of all ancient literature. Protestants soon came to emphasize that the 'Alexandrians' or Neo-Platonists had introduced allegorical interpretation into Christianity, and thus hostility to allegory became hostility to Neo- Platonism. Violent disputes soon raged over whether the Neo-Platonists had corrupted the early Christian theologians and thus led the Church away from the 'pure' Christianity of the Gospels.For a short survey, see Novotny, op. cit., pp. 507‚Äì511. These theological controversies shaped modern classical scholarship. They are reflected in the great scholarly history of philosophy by Brucker, his Critical History of Philosophy (1742‚Äì1744) that, for example, blames the Neo-Platonists for corrupting the Roman Catholic Church: > The Eclectic sect [of Neo-Platonists], thus raised upon the foundations of > superstition, enthusiasm [i.e., mysticism], and imposture, proved the > occasion of much confusion and mischief both to the Christian religion and > philosophy... Pagan ideas and opinions were by degrees mixed with the pure > and simple doctrine of the Gospel ... [and] corrupted the pure religion of > Christ; and his church became a field of contention, and a nursery of > error.English translation by W. Enfield: Brucker, The History of Philosophy > (London: Thomas Tegg, 1839), p. 344. Original Latin: Historia Critica > Philosophiae (Leipzig, 1742‚Äì1744), 5 vols. Brucker was openly contemptuous toward the Neo-Platonists: 'Lost in subtleties these pretenders to superior wisdom were perpetually endeavoring to explain by imaginary resemblances, and arbitrary distinctions, what they themselves probably never understood.'Brucker, op. cit., p. 345. Brucker recognized that the Neo-Platonists thought of themselves simply as Platonists but denied this was the case: > The Eclectic sect [later called Neo-Platonists] is not commonly known among > ancient writers under any distinct name; for this obvious reason, that its > most celebrated supporters chose rather to pass themselves upon the world as > Platonists, than to assume a new title; but that the sect really existed as > such [as a separate sect with novel doctrines], no one, who attends to the > facts ... can entertain a doubt... They endeavored to conceal the > absurdities of the ancient [Pagan] religion by casting over its fables the > veil of allegory, and thus represented them as founded upon immortal > truths... the Alexandrian philosophers, though they founded their system > chiefly upon the doctrine of Plato, departed from him in many > particulars.Brucker, op. cit., pp. 326, 344, 348. For Brucker, the allegorical commentators on Plato were 'mad, liars, impostors, vain and foolish forgers of a most detestable and false philosophy ...'E. N. Tigerstedt, The Decline and Fall of the Neoplatonic Interpretation of Plato: an outline and some observations(Societas Scientariarum Fennica, 1974), p. 58. Thus by the mid 1700s, allegorical interpretation was blamed on the Neo-Platonists and the Neo-Platonists were no longer Platonists. Brucker's negative view of Neo-Platonism was spread across Europe by the French Encyclopedia of Diderot and D'Alembert, which labelled Neo-Platonism a 'superstition' in the article Eclectisme.Encyclop√©die, ou dictionnaire raisonn√© des sciences, des arts et des m√©tiers,v. XII, 3rd edition, 1774, p. 682. A 1755 version is online at http://encyclop√©die.eu/index.php/science- mathematiques/philosophie/1068928316-ECLECTISME. The decline of allegorical interpretations of Plato was part of a European-wide rejection of traditional allegory across literature, religion, and philosophy. During the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries, '... allegory is forced out by the standard-bearers of modernity: empiricism, [rigorous] historiography, realism, and plain, rational speech... these shifts produced the end of allegory based on Platonic Ideas, Christian theology, or syncretic versions of these ...'Theresa M. Kelley, Reinventing Allegory (Cambridge: University Press, 1997), p. 2. Goethe (1749 ‚Äì 1832) famously elevated the 'symbol' and denigrated allegory in his Maxims and Reflections. Goethe, Einzelheiten, Maximen und Reflexionen, 1833 (various editions and translations). See Nicholas Halmi, 'Symbol and Allegory' in Christopher John Murray, ed., Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era, 1760-1850, v. 2, pp. 1113-4. In classical scholarship, the work of Friedrich August Wolf (1759 ‚Äì 1824) marks the final rejection of allegorical methods. He influentially advocated that classics should turn from literary methods and become a more rigorous 'science of antiquity' (Altertumswissenschaft).Jay David Bolter, 'Friedrich August Wolf and the Scientific Study of Antiquity,' Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies, v. 21, 1980, pp. 83‚Äì99. See also F. A. Wolf, Darstellung der Alterthumswissenschaft (Berlin, 1807).  Rise of modern esotericism: Tennemann to the T√ºbingen School  Tennemann, System of Platonic Philosophy (1792) Said to be the first, modern monograph on Plato, Tennemann's study interpreted Plato as a rationalist, and believed a logical, philosophical system lay concealed in the dialogues. After early modern Protestant scholars ended the tradition of reading Plato allegorically, German philosophers developed new ways of finding deeper meanings in Plato. These 'modern esotericists'E. N. Tigerstedt, Interpreting Plato (Almqvist & Wiksell Internat, 1977), p. 68. later assembled historical evidence that, they argued, showed that Plato expounded secret or esoteric doctrines orally that were transmitted through his students and their successors. These approaches reject ancient and Renaissance allegoresis but retain the distinction between the surface, literal meaning of the dialogues and Plato's concealed, esoteric doctrines. Though Brucker rejected the allegories of the Neo-Platonists, he continued the tradition of regarding Plato as an esoteric writer who concealed his deeper philosophy. Brucker, however, made no attempt to reveal Plato's inner doctrines: > ... among other things which Plato received from foreign philosophy, he was > careful to borrow the art of concealing his real opinions. His inclination > towards this kind of concealment appears from the obscure language which > abounds in his writings, and may indeed be learned from his own express > assertions. 'It is a difficult thing,' says he, 'to discover the nature of > the Creator of the universe; and being discovered it is impossible, and > would even be impious, to expose the discovery to vulgar understandings' > (Timaeus, 28).... [Plato] purposely threw a veil of obscurity over his > public instructions, which was only removed for the benefit of those who > were thought worthy of being admitted to his more private and confidential > lectures. This concealed method of philosophizing he was induced to adopt > from a regard to his personal safety, and from motives of vanity...English > translation by W. Enfield: Brucker, The History of Philosophy (London: > Thomas Tegg, 1839), p. 125. Original Latin: Historia Critica Philosophiae > (Leipzig, 1742‚Äì1744), 5 vols. The philosopher Wilhelm Gottlieb Tennemann (1761 ‚Äì 1819) influentially denied that Plato was a mystic (schw√§rmer) and portrayed him as a precursor to Enlightenment rationalism and Kant's philosophy.Tennemann's interpretation of Plato appeared in his 1792, four-volume System der Platonischen Philosophie (Jena: 1792‚Äì1795) and was summarized in his influential History of Philosophy (11 volumes, 1798 ‚Äì 1819). References below are to the discussion of Plato in the 1799 volume II of Geschichte der Philosophie (Leipzig: Barth, 1799). Echoing Luther's solo scriptura, Tennemann emphasized that Plato's dialogues were the 'only pure and clear source' for evidence about Plato's philosophy,Tennemann, Geschichte, v. II, pp. 203, 221. and thus rejected the ancient allegorical commentaries. Like the Neo-Platonists, however, Tennemann argued at length that Plato did have a 'secret' or 'esoteric philosophy.'Tennemann, Geschichte, v. II, pp. 200, 202, 205, 207, 214, 220-1. Brucker's 1742 Critical History already counted Plato an esotericist: 'he purposely threw a veil of obscurity over his public instructions ... This concealed method of philosophizing he was induced to adopt from a concern for his personal safety ...' (Brucker, op. cit, p. 125). Drawing on the criticism of writing in Plato's Phaedrus and the Seventh Letter attributed to Plato, Tennemann asserted Plato had both practical and philosophical reasons for withholding his 'unwritten doctrines.'Tennemann, Geschichte, v. II, p. 205 ff. Tennemann finally laid out his grand project of close reading and comparisons between the dialogues that, he claimed, had enabled him to reconstruct much of Plato's lost esoteric philosophy.Tennemann, Geschichte, v. II, p. 216-8, 220-2. According to Tigerstedt, > Tennemann, not any classical author, is the real father of the modern > Esoterists [sic]. He shares with them a positive and negative assumption: > the belief that any philosopher worthy of the name has a system, and the > rejection ‚Äì whether articulate or understood ‚Äì of the attempt of the > Neoplatonists to find their own system in Plato's writings. It is the > combination of these two assumptions that has given birth to the modern > Esoteric interpretation of Plato.'Tigerstedt, Interpreting Plato (Stockholm: > Almqvist & Wiksell Internat, 1977), pp. 66-7. The renowned Protestant theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768 ‚Äì 1834), sometimes known as the 'founder of hermeneutics,' published translations of Plato's dialogues that were long standard in Germany and reinforced the German search for Plato's esoteric philosophy through new kinds of subtle interpretation.For a discussion of the background and reception, see the introductory essays edited by Peter M. Steiner in Friedrich Schleiermacher, √úber die Philosophie Platons: Die Einleitungen zur √úbersetzung des Platon (Hamburg: Felix Meiner Verlag, 1996). Schleiermacher's influential 'General Introduction' to his Plato translations rejected ancient esoteric interpretations of Plato but praised and extended Tennemann's rationalist esotericism.References below are to the English translation: W. Dobson, Schleiermacher's Introductions to the Dialogues of Plato (Cambridge: Pitt Press, 1836), p. 11. Writing during the rise of German romanticism, Schleiermacher argued that Tennemann's 'analytic' dissection of Plato needed to be supplemented by a more romantic or psychological, holistic interpretation of Plato's entire oeuvre: > ... to that analytical exposition [of Tennemann's] which we now have been in > possession of for a short time, in perfection far exceeding former attempts, > it is a necessary supplementary process to restore to their natural > connection those limbs, [the dialogues,] ... as expositions continuously > more complete as they advance ... so that while every dialogue is taken not > only as a whole in itself but also in its connection with the rest ... > [Plato] may at last be understood as a Philosopher and a perfect > Artist.Dobson, p. 14. This required a kind of subtle interpretation since, in Plato, '... the real investigation is overdrawn with another, not like a veil, but, as it were, an adhesive skin, which conceals from the inattentive reader ... the matter which is to be properly considered or discovered ...'Dobson, p. 18. An engraving of Schleiermacher from his early adulthood. In the middle of the Twentieth Century, the so-called T√ºbingen School,This is not the same as the theological movement also known as the 'T√ºbingen School' and associated with Ferdinand Christian Baur. initiated by the German scholars Hans Joachim Kr√§mer and Konrad Gaiser, pushed esoteric interpretations of Plato in a novel direction.For a recent introduction and overview, see Dmitri Nikulin, ed., The Other Plato: The T√ºbingen Interpretation of Plato's Inner-Academic Teachings (Albany: SUNY, 2012) or Maurizio Migliori, Il Disordine ordinato: la filosofia dialettica di Platone (Brescia: Editrice Morcelliana, 2013). For a brief overview, see David J. Murphy's review (which lists the main texts of the T√ºbingen School) of Thomas A. Szlez√°k and Karl-Heinz Stanzel, Platonisches Philosophieren. Zehn Vortr√§ge zu Ehren von Hans Joachim Kr√§mer in the Bryn Mawr Classical Review, http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2002/2002-08-06.html . It is well-known that Aristotle refers to Plato's 'unwritten teachings' and that Plato's followers attribute metaphysical theories to him that are not spelled out in the dialogues.Hans Joachim Kr√§mer and John R. Catan, Plato and the Foundations of Metaphysics: A Work on the Theory of the Principles and Unwritten Doctrines of Plato with a Collection of the Fundamental Documents (SUNY Press, 1990). The T√ºbingen School collects further references to these metaphysical theories from later in antiquity and concludes that Plato did in fact have a systematic, oral teaching that he kept out of the dialogues. This is esoteric in the literal sense: Plato taught it within the walls of his school.The word 'esoteric' comes from the Greek eso- for 'inside' and teric for 'the walls': originally, therefore, a teaching for insiders. It later came to mean a mystical teaching. These oral teachings were supposedly transmitted down through the centuries, and this accounts for the reliability of the evidence from late antiquity. The T√ºbingen School was famously attacked by the prominent American scholars Harold F. ChernissHarold Cherniss, The Riddle of the Early Academy (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1945). See also H. Cherniss, Aristotle's Criticism of Plato and the Academy (Baltimore, 1944). and Gregory VlastosGregory Vlastos, review of H. J. Kraemer, Arete bei Platon und Aristoteles, in Gnomon, v. 35, 1963, pp. 641-655. Reprinted with a further appendix in: Platonic Studies (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1981, 2nd ed.), pp. 379-403. and English-speaking scholars thereafter tended to be skeptical. In 1974, however, Findlay published Plato: The Written and Unwritten Doctrines that similarly used evidence from the Neo-Platonists to discern Plato's unwritten doctrines.John Niemeyer Findlay, Plato: The Written and Unwritten Doctrines (London: Routledge, 2013). In 1983, Kenneth Sayre argued that the dialogues properly interpreted contained definite allusions to Plato's esoteric metaphysics.K. Sayre, Plato's Late Ontology: A Riddle Resolved (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1983) and Metaphysics and Method in Plato's Statesman (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011). Adherents of the T√ºbingen School are common in Germany and Italy but in 2012 Nikulin remarked '... the majority of the scholars in the Anglo-American world remain unconvinced that the T√ºbingen interpretation offered a glimpse into the historical Plato.'Dmitri Nikulin, ed., The Other Plato: The T√ºbingen Interpretation of Plato's Inner-Academic Teachings (Albany: SUNY, 2012), preface. John Dillon, however, has argued for a moderate view. He accepts the early evidence that Plato had a more elaborate metaphysics than appears in the dialogues, but doubts there was any continuous, oral transmission in later centuries.John Dillon, The Heirs of Plato: A Study of the Old Academy, 347 ‚Äì 274 BCE (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2003), esp. pp. 16‚Äì29. The influential American philosopher and political theorist Leo Strauss learned about the esoteric interpretations of Plato as a student in Germany. His Persecution and the Art of Writing extended them into the controversial view that philosophical writing generally contained concealed meanings that could be discovered by 'reading between the lines.'  Rise of revisionism: Dodds, Tigerstedt, and Kahn  For several centuries after the Protestant Reformation, Neo-Platonism was condemned as a decadent and 'oriental' distortion of Platonism. In a famous 1929 essay, E. R. Dodds showed that key conceptions of Neo-Platonism could be traced from their origin in Plato's dialogues, through his immediate followers (e.g., Speusippus) and the Neo- Pythagoreans, to Plotinus and the Neo-Platonists. Thus Plotinus' philosophy was 'not the starting-point of Neo-Platonism but its intellectual culmination.'E. R. Dodds, 'The Parmenides of Plato and the Origin of the Neoplatonic One,' The Classical Quarterly, v. 22, No. 3/4, 1928, pp. 129-142, esp. 140. Further research reinforced this view and by 1954 Merlan could say 'The present tendency is toward bridging rather than widening the gap separating Platonism from Neo-Platonism.'Philip Merlan, From Platonism to Neoplatonism (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1954, 1968), p. 3. E. N. Tigerstedt's history of the Reformation's separation of Neo-Platonism from Platonism concluded that its motives were theological and so illegitimate: '... many theologians, most but not all of them Protestants, were highly suspicious of the evil influence of Platonism on Christian theology ... the separation of Platonism from Neo-Platonism seems to have been inspired by the wish to dissociate Plato from his later followers, who were regarded as anti- Christian, and thus maintain the venerable view of Plato as anima naturaliter Christiana ['a natural Christian soul'].'Tigerstedt, op. cit., 1974, pp. 48-9. In 2013, Catana argued > ...the divide between Middle Platonism and Neoplatonism is justified on the > part of Brucker by means of assumptions that are untenable. Hence it becomes > very difficult to maintain a divide between the two periods ... I think we > ought to abandon the divide completely, since it cannot be justified in the > essentialistic manner proposed by Brucker. Given the fact that the division > obscures more than it reveals, we would be better off without it.Leo Catana, > 'The Origin of the Division between Middle Platonism and Neoplatonism,' > Apeiron, v. 46, n. 2, 2013, pp. 166-200. See also The Historiographical > Concept 'System of Philosophy', (Leiden: Brill, 2008). Thus recent scholarship has transformed Neo-Platonism from an aberration that could be ignored into a phase of Platonism. In 1996, the prominent American scholar, Charles Kahn, advocated an 'ingressive interpretation' that reads beneath the surface and finds Neo-Platonic themes within Plato's dialogues: > Why so much deviousness on Plato's part? Why do dialogues ... obscurely hint > at doctrines ...? In the case of Plato, his lifetime loyalty to the dialogue > form suggests a temperamental aversion to direct statement, reinforced by > much reflection on the obstacles to successful communication for > philosophical insight... [Plato's indirect and subtle,] ingressive mode of > exposition has, I suggest, been chosen by Plato because of his acute sense > of the psychological distance that separates his world view from that of his > audience... Plato's metaphysical vision ... is recognizably that of Plotinus > and the Neoplatonists ... C. H. Kahn, Plato and the Socratic Dialogue: The > Philosophical Use of a Literary Form (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, > 1996), pp. 65-67. Although Kahn does not see any extensive use of allegory or symbolism in Plato's dialogues, his approach calls for a kind of subtle interpretation that reaches conclusions he compares to those discovered by Neo-Platonist allegoresis.

The film stars Douglas Smith, Lucien Laviscount, Cressida Bonas, Doug Jones, Carrie-Anne Moss, Faye Dunaway, and Jenna Kanell. Principal photography began on November 2, 2015, in Cleveland, Ohio. STXfilms released the film on January 13, 2017, to negative reviews. It grossed $29 million worldwide on a budget of $7.4 million.  Plot  In 1969, a mass murder occurs in Madison, Wisconsin during which a man kills people on his block. As he shoots the neighbors, he continuously asks if anyone spoke about \\"the name\\" which cannot be said. He also repeats the same thing over and over: \\"Don't say it, don't think it; don't think it, don't say it.\\" In present day, Elliot, his girlfriend Sasha, and friend John move into an off-campus house not far from their college. Soon, mysterious things start to happen, such as Sasha developing a strange cough and Elliot finding coins in a nightstand that continually reappear. Elliot also finds writing consisting of \\"don't think it, don't say it\\", and a name: the Bye Bye Man. During a seance involving their friend Kim, the name is mentioned. Sasha continues to become sick as Elliot and John start experiencing hallucinations and stranger activity. Elliot begins to suspect that Sasha is cheating on him with John, like what Virgil had said at the party before 'The Bye Bye Man' was released. The librarian shows Elliot a dossier about the Bye Bye Man; a teenager killed his family and told a reporter that the Bye Bye Man made him do it. The same reporter later became a mass shooter during the '60's who killed himself after realizing people knew about the Bye Bye Man. Kim is killed after she is struck by a train. Elliot is taken in for questioning by Detective Shaw and is released when Kim's suicide note reveals she killed her roommate and was planning on killing Elliot, Sasha, and John. Elliot also visits the widow of the reporter, who reveals that the curse causes insanity, hallucinations, and eventually, death. Signs of his coming are coins mysteriously appearing, sounds of a train, and a large, skinless hound. The only way to prevent it is to not think of his name or speak of him. If someone already knows, they must be killed. The librarian is hit by Elliot's car by accident after she killed everyone in her home, coming for Elliot next. Sasha and John are also suffering from hallucinations. Elliot finds John stabbing Sasha. He shoots John, but after he picks up the corpse, it is revealed to have been Sasha that was stabbing John; therefore, Elliot killed Sasha. The Bye Bye Man appears and gives Elliot a hallucination. Elliot keeps Virgil and his daughter Alice away long enough for him to shoot himself with a gun. Virgil and Alice get away before the entire house goes up in flames. While riding home, Alice reveals she found the coins from the nightstand near the trash, along with the writing. However, she could not read it due to her poor night vision. Detective Shaw arrives at the scene where John is found to be alive but wounded. John then whispers the name to Shaw, allowing the Bye Bye Man's curse to spread again.

Critical response  On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 18% based on 87 reviews and an average rating of 3.44/10.

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C\\" on an A+ to F scale. A. A. Dowd of The A.V. Club said, \\"on top of the general hoariness, this is also an uncommonly, at times unbelievably inept movie; from its acting to its script to most of its technical aspects, it feels barely fit for the big screen. The Bye Bye Man is so bad, in fact, that it retroactively improves the half-assed Hollywood horror that it‚Äôd be lucky to better resemble.\\" Kalyn Corrigan, writing for Bloody Disgusting, said the film had \\"poorly developed characters\\", a \\"muddled mythology\\", and \\"horribly shoddy editing,\\" ultimately giving the film a 2/5 rating. Jake Dee for JoBlo.com said \\"in a room full of 200 or so public patrons, the film drew far more auditory laughs than terrified gasps,\\" and awarded it a 3/10 rating.

Located south of downtown Bellows Falls, the area has one of the largest concentrations of well-preserved 19th century residences in southern Vermont. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002, and enlarged in 2007. Description and history Bellows Falls is an incorporated village within the municipality of Rockingham in southeastern Vermont. It is located on the west bank of Connecticut River, and was the site at which that river was first bridged, in 1785. As a consequence, the village has since then been a transportation hub, as a nexus of water, road, and railroad routes formed there over the course of the 19th century. Industrial development grew in part due to the Bellows Falls Canal, which provided water power to a variety of industries. The village downtown grew immediately west of the canal and the primary industrial area, and its residential neighborhoods grew west and south of the downtown. The residential historic district, when first designated in 2002, was a roughly bounded on the north by School Street, the east by Westminster Street, and the west by Atkinson Street (United States Route 5), extending a short way west of Atkinson on Burt Street and Hapgood Place. In 2007 it was enlarged by about to the southwest, extending that boundary south of Burt Street to Pine and Center Streets, and Old Terrace to the southeast. This neighborhood area contains one of the best concentrations of pre-World War II residential architecture in southern Vermont. Most of the housing in this area is wood frame construction, buildings typically containing one to three units. Most of the housing stock was built between about 1850 and 1920, when the village was economically at its peak, and represent a cross section of architectural styles of that period. The oldest buildings in the area date to the late 18th century. Institutional buildings include two schools, two churches, two fraternal meeting houses, a library, and a funeral home. More than 90% of the buildings in the district were built before 1950, a remarkably high concentration for districts of this size.

The theatre was transformed into its current incarnation in 2008; becoming one of Tampa's premier live music and events venue. History In 1958 In 1917, the building opened as the Rivoli Theatre, a red brick building with a silent movie theater on the first floor and various apartments on the second floor. It was the first theater of its kind in the United States. In 1931, the building underwent an expansion and reopened as The Ritz Theatre. It continued to show a variety of standard films until December 31, 1965, when it transitioned to nude shows and XXX-rated films. In September 1983, developer William E. Field purchased the building and remodeled it once again. Field‚Äôs ambitions never materialized, and a bank foreclosure in 1987 forced him to close his doors. That same year, the building was leased to The Masquerade nightclub. As Masquerade, the venue saw the performances of a variety of rising alternative acts. In 1988, the Capitano family purchased the building as an investment property. In 1973 and 1989, Ybor City was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the National Historic Landmark District, respectively. This building was listed as a contribution in both entries. In 2006, the Masquerade tenants were evicted. The building underwent a $2 million renovation and on June 26, 2008 opened its doors as The Ritz Ybor, a special events and live music venue.

The former residence of the President of the Republic of the Orange Free State from 1886 until 1899 when the city fell to the British Empire during the Second Anglo-Boer War. History A trekboer family with the surname of Brits settled on the site in the 1820s and built a thatched A-frame dwelling for themselves. Major Henry Douglas Warden (then the British resident for the area north of the Orange River) purchased it from the Brits family in 1846. The thatched-house built by the Brits family was demolished and the house he (Warden) erected began as a small farm building which was made out of sun-dried bricks. It is referred to as a 'nederige kleihuis' (Afrikaans for humble clay-house). In 1854, The British Government abandoned the Orange River Sovereignty and the Boer Republic then took over the residence. This independence saw the new presidents of the republic take up quarters in the \\"Residency\\", reportedly Presidents Josias Philip Hoffman, Jacobus Nicolaas Boshoff and Marthinus Wessel Pretorius. State President of the Orange Free State They all lived in the dwelling during their terms in office. In 1860, the Volksraad (The parliament of the former Orange Free State Republic, which existed from 1857 to 1902) approved plans for a new Presidency house. At that time, the Volksraad could only afford ¬£800 for the restoration of the old residency. Additional repairs were carried out in 1864 and 1874. In the early 1880s the Volksraad decided that the cost of maintenance was unfeasible and that the building was no longer suitable as the official residence of the head of state of an independent country. Thus in 1882 President Johannes Brand submitted plans for a competition to design the 'new' Presidency to the Volksraad. There were in total 27 proposals submitted in 1884 for the prize money of ¬£100. An international architectural competition was held and won by English architects ‚Äì Lennox Canning and F Goad of Canning & Goad Architects. The construction of the building was budgeted at ¬£10,000, but the design submitted by Canning was too sophisticated and even after being asked to simplify their design, it still amounted to ¬£12, 200. With some reluctance, this was accepted. The excavation of new foundations for the new building was deemed too costly, subsequently it was decided to build the new building on the foundation of the old one. . Construction started on 22 May 1885, when the foundation stone was laid, and the building was completed in 1886 with President Brand taking up quarters until his death in 1888. Presidents F.W. Reitz (1888‚Äì95) and M.T. Steyn (1896-1900) also resided in the building until the British occupation of Bloemfontein on 13 March 1900 when the building served as the headquarters of Field-Marshal Lord Roberts during the Second Anglo-Boer War. Other uses of the Presidency After the British captured Bloemfontein on 13 March 1900, the building became known as the Government House and was occupied by Lord Roberts and his officers; and later by Sir Hamilton J Goold-Adams (1901-1910) who was the Lieutenant-Governor of the Orange River Colony. During the time of Goold-Adams, the architect Sir Herbert Baker made some additions to the Presidency and also added the stables to the back of the house. Along the years, the Presidency served as the following: *Annexe for Eunice School *Headquarters for the Orange Free State Command *Hostel for Normal College students *Offices for Free State Library Services *Venue for Performing Arts Centre of the Free State (PACOFS) Haunting The stables at the back of the building are thought to be haunted with several reports of people hearing carriages moving into the stables. The premises reportedly house the ghost of a dog with many people hearing ephemeral barking at night. There are also many stories of children being spotted within the building due to the buildings tenure as a school and hostel. Declaration status and Museum The building was restored from 1973 to 1983. The museum mainly focuses on the lives and history of the three heads of state (Brand, Reitz and Steyn) during their respective terms of office. This site was originally declared a national monument on 27 January 1938 and later revised 15 December 1989 to the following: *SiteReference: 9/2/302/0007 *DeclarationType: Provincial Heritage Site *GazetteNo: 12214 *Gazette Date: Friday, December 15, 1989 *NoticeNo: 2709.Notice *Date: Friday, December 15, 1989. *Description The property, together with the Old Presidency thereon situated in President Brand Street, Bloemfontein, being certain Consolidated Erf 24722, situated in the city of Bloemfontein, District of Bloemfontein, in extent 3, 0586 hectares.

McCarty (December 31, 1905 ‚Äì April 5, 1999) was an officer and pilot in the United States Air Force who served as chief of staff for U.S. Air Forces in Europe in February 1963. He came to Germany from Headquarters U.S. Air Force, Washington, D.C., where he served an assistant chief of staff for Reserve Forces. He also held political offices in Oregon. McCarty directed an important airlift of supplies during the Korean War and was the first Air Force pilot to fly over the South Pole. Early life McCarty was born in 1905 in Pendleton, Oregon, and graduated from Northwestern College of Law in Portland, Oregon in 1929. Active in the Oregon National Guard for many years, he advanced from an Infantry private to battery commander of Artillery, holding all enlisted ranks through master sergeant. His reserve commissioned status dates from 1926. Political career Assistant attorney general of Oregon from 1930 to 1936, McCarty was elected to the Oregon State Senate in 1942. However, he declined to serve because he was called to active duty as a captain in the United States Army Air Corps. Military career During World War II, McCarty served as squadron commander and operations officer at Morrison Field in Palm Beach, Florida and at Borinquen Field in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. He was a staff officer with the North African Wing of the Air Transport Command, and later, commander of a chain of air bases in the Middle East. On his return to the United States in 1945, McCarty commanded the \\"brass hat\\" transport group at Washington National Airport. Returning to civilian life in 1946, McCarty resumed practice as head of a Portland law firm, and became active in the Air Force Reserve as commander of the 305th Air Division and later of the 403d Troop Carrier Wing. He was national president of the Air Reserve Association from 1949 to 1950.

It was purchased by Federal Fleet Services as part of Project Resolve, and was later converted into a supply ship for the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN). She is intended to act as an interim replacement between the out of service and the future . Originally launched in Germany in 2010 as Cynthia, the ship was converted and delivered to the RCN in December 2017 when she will be leased to the navy with a merchant navy crew, complemented by RCN personnel. Asterix will be in Canadian service well into the 2020s. The ship was owned by Capital Ship Management of Greece and registered in Monrovia, Liberia. The vessel was delivered at Quebec in October 2015 for conversion by a pan-consortium comprising Chantier Davie Canada, Aecon Pictou Shipyard of Pictou, Nova Scotia and NavTech, the conversion designer. The vessel is limited in her deployment to enter dangerous areas due to her lack of weapons systems and ability to survive combat damage. Construction and career as container ship The ship was laid down on 21 October 2008 at the Nordic Yards Wismar in Wismar, Germany with the yard number 147. The ship was launched as Cynthia on 27 January 2009 and work was completed on the vessel on 1 May 2010. The ship was renamed Amorito in 2010. That same year the ship was renamed again to Neermoor, operating under an Antigua and Barbuda flag while owned by Briese Schiffahrts GmbH & Co KG. In 2013 the ship was renamed Asterix. Project Resolve The ship was selected for the Royal Canadian Navy's Project Resolve, where in conjunction with Davie Shipbuilding of Quebec, a ship would be leased by the RCN and converted for use as a naval auxiliary supply vessel. The work converting the ship was initially to be done partially at the AECON shipyard in Pictou, Nova Scotia before being completed at Davie Shipbuilding in Quebec; instead, the ship was sent directly to Davie Shipbuilding. Pending an official agreement between the shipyard and the Canadian government, the vessel was to be ready by mid-2017. The ship is planned to be under contract with the Royal Canadian Navy until 2021 when the second of the two Protecteur-class support ships (renamed from the Queenston class) would be completed. The ship was reportedly acquired for $20 million. In September 2015, it was announced that L-3 MAPPS (a subsidiary of L-3 Communications) was selected as partner in the conversion for its Integrated Platform Management System. Hepburn Engineering was chosen to provide new state of the art Replenishment at Sea equipment. OSI Maritime Systems was chosen by Davie Shipyards to install their integrated navigation and tactical system aboard the converted ship. In November 2015, the Liberal government delayed final approval of the $700 million seven-year deal for two months. On 30 November 2015, the Liberal government reversed that decision and gave final approval for the project, allowing Davie to go ahead with the conversion. , the conversion was ahead of schedule, with 60% of the conversion completed. On 20 July 2017 Davie Shipbuilding unveiled Asterix in a public ceremony with the traditional breaking of a bottle of champagne. This honour was performed by Pauline Th√©berge, spouse of J. Michel Doyon, the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec. The vessel was re-launched on 15 October 2017 at Quebec City. Sea trials were scheduled to begin on 16 November in Gasp√© Bay. The vessel arrived at Halifax, Nova Scotia on 27 December 2017 to embark naval complement to begin training in January 2018. While shifting position within Halifax Harbour in preparation for a storm, the ship lost power. No damage was done to Asterix and the vessel made it safely to the new position. The vessel completed sea trials and was formally accepted into service with the Royal Canadian Navy in January 2018. Design The Chilean Navy frigate and the Indian Navy frigate perform a replenishment-at-sea with Asterix off the coast of Hawaii during Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) 2018 exercise on 28 July 2018 The vessel will also have a container bay for protection of the containers while in transit. The ship has a double hull, a feature that the previous Protecteur class did not have and prevented them from operating outside of international waters. A retractable thruster at the bow was added for additional maneuverability and redundancy. The extra thruster allows for dynamic positioning and improved station-keeping in Asterix. For mission purposes the ship will have rooms for crew and medical/hospital facilities for humanitarian missions, along with humanitarian and disaster relief capabilities. There will be an area to treat and process evacuees and survivors; a large medical ward divided into two areas capable of treating up to 60. The ship will also provide room for 350 in emergency situations. Asterix, post-conversion, will be able to operate up to eight smaller boats with quick launch and recovery capability. Asterix will have two aircraft hangars planned for two embarked CH-148 Cyclones, but big enough to hold CH-147F Chinooks, as well as a landing deck capable of handling the largest helicopters. The ship will be crewed by 36 civilian personnel and up to 114 military personnel, with a 67-person detachment specifically aboard for replenishment duties. Due to the civilian nature of her design, Asterix is limited in her ability to survive damage sustained in combat. The ship also lacks any installed self-defense weapons systems, although there are provisions should the need arise. These two issues prevent the ship from being deployed to hazardous combat areas. Royal Canadian Navy service In June and July 2018, Asterix, along with the s and , took part in RIMPAC 2018 around the Hawaiian Islands. The ship then joined in the Western Pacific, visiting Da Nang, Vietnam. Calgary and Asterix sailed in the South China Sea and were shadowed by a Chinese naval vessel. Asterix supported Calgary during the frigate's assignment enforcing United Nations resolutions against North Korea. After a year at sea, Asterix and Calgary returned to Canada at CFB Esquimalt on 18 December. On 6 February 2019, and Asterix departed Esquimalt for Pacific operations with other nations' navies. On 18 February, a Cyclone helicopter from Regina was attempting to land on Asterix and was damaged in the operation. Asterix and the damaged Cyclone were redirected to Guam to undergo inspection. No damage was reported to Asterix, and following air tests of the repaired Cyclone, both ships resumed their deployment. In March 2019, Regina and Asterix parted ways, with Regina deployed to the Middle East as part of Operation Artemis. The vessel returned to Halifax on 26 August after 500 days at sea performing 197 refueling operations with 40 warships. See also * ‚Äì converted tanker serving with the Royal Australian Navy.

The by-election was caused by the resignation of incumbent MP William Cargill. The nomination meeting was held on 28 March and as Thomas Gillies was the only person proposed, he was declared elected unopposed. Background The Dunedin Country electorate was one of the original 24 parliamentary electorates of New Zealand from , and it was one of the two-member electorates. From the , the electorate was represented by William and John Cargill, a father and son team. Cargill Jr. was one of many members of the House of Representatives who resigned prior to the second session of the 2nd New Zealand Parliament; the house had not been convened in 1857. In the resulting 1858 Dunedin Country by- election, he was replaced by John Parkin Taylor. Cargill Sr. rarely spoke in the house and found travel to parliament in Auckland difficult. Regarded as the father of Otago, he had also been the first Superintendent of Otago Province. In July 1859, he announced \\"that it has been his feeling for some time past, under a sense of advancing years, to retire from the Superintendency\\". He did retire at the next provincial election in November 1859. Cargill senior resigned from the House of Representatives on 12 December 1859. Results The returning officer, John Gillies, set the date of the nomination meeting for 28 March 1860, and if an election would become necessary, this was to be held on 11 April. John Richard Jones proposed and Charles Kettle seconded Thomas Gillies, the son of the returning officer. As this was the only person proposed, Gillies Jr. was declared elected unopposed. Gillies represented the Dunedin Country electorate until the end of the term; parliament was dissolved on 5 November 1860 and the Dunedin Country electorate was abolished. Gillies was instead elected as a representative of the electorate in 1861. William Cargill died on 6 August 1860, less than a year after his resignation from parliament.

The SBOE provides advocacy and policy guidance for the District of Columbia Public Schools, and works with the Chancellor of the District of Columbia Public Schools and the District of Columbia State Superintendent of Education. Charter schools are overseen by the District of Columbia Public Charter School Board. Early boards of education Authority for the establishment of public education in the District of Columbia was granted by the United States Congress in 1802, when the existing Commissioner system of government was abolished and a mayor-council government created. Two years later, a 13-member Board of Trustees was established to oversee schools in the District. Seven members were appointed by the mayor, while the remaining six were elected by those citizens who had donated funds to the city's school system. Thomas Jefferson was elected to the board, and became its first president (serving until 1808). The City Council divided the District of Columbia into two school districts in 1816. One was governed by the existing Board of Trustees, and the other by a board appointed by the council. Two years later, the \\"old board\\" was abolished and replaced by a board appointed solely by the council. For most of the 19th century, the District of Columbia was divided into three distinct legal entities: The Federal City (consisting mostly of the area south of Florida Avenue), the town of Georgetown, the town of Alexandria, and the County of Washington (that part of the District not included in the previous three entities). In 1842, Georgetown established a seven-member Board of School Guardians to oversee private schools receiving public funds. Two years later, the Federal City's two school boards were merged into a single 13-member board. Three board members were appointed by the council from each of the city's four wards, while the mayor served as the board president. The council turned over its appointment authority to the mayor in 1858, and for the first time the board of trustees was required to promulgate an annual budget and annual report. Schools in the District of Columbia were segregated by race from the beginning. Although the city's first school for African American children was created in 1807, it was not until 1862 that an oversight body was created for these schools. That year, the United States Secretary of the Interior established and appointed a Board of Trustees for Colored Schools. In 1864, Congress enacted legislation establishing a seven-member School Commission to oversee public schools in Washington County. Members of the board were appointed by the Washington County Levy Court. The District of Columbia's first Superintendent of Education was created by the City Council in 1869. The mayor was given authority to appoint this position. In 1871, Congress merged the county, Georgetown, and Federal City into a single legal entity (Alexandria having been retroceded to Virginia in 1846). The new \\"territorial government\\" retains school boards for the Federal City, Georgetown, and old county, and appoints a superintendent of education for each board. The Secretary of the Interior also retained separate school boards for African American schools in the Federal City and Georgetown, and began appointing a superintendent of education for each. Two years later, Congress turned authority to appoint the superintendents for black schools to the territorial government. Congress abolished the territorial government in 1874, and created a three-member commission to oversee the District of Columbia. Congress also abolished all the city's school boards and replaced them with a single, 19-member Board of School Trustees. Congress also required the commissioners to appoint two superintendents of education, one for white schools and one for black schools. Congress reduced the size of the board to nine members in 1882, and required that three of them be African Americans. The commissioners attempted to take over the duties of the board of trustees in 1885, but protests from city residents forced the commissioners to return many of these powers to the board. Congress expanded the board's membership to 11 in 1895, and authorized the appointment of women to the board of trustees for the first time. Modern board of education After a political struggle for control over public schools led to a congressional investigation in 1900, Congress significantly reformed public school governance again. New legislation established a seven-member Board of Education (BOE) whose members were appointed by the city's three federal commissioners. The BOE was given complete control over the public schools, and had the sole authority to appoint a superintendent and two assistant superintendents (one for white and one for black schools). The BOE also had the authority to hire and fire teachers and other school employees. The BOE was now required to submit an annual budget to the commissioners, who would review it and forward recommendations to Congress as part of the city's annual budget process. Dissatisfied with the political nature of the commissioners' appointments to the BOE, in 1906 Congress reformed the Board of Education yet again. The board was expanded to nine members, three of whom were required to be women. The authority to appoint board members was turned over to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, and the authority of the BOE was strengthened and clarified (although budgetary authority remained with the commissioners). A tradition emerged in which three of the BOE's members were African American (two men and one woman). In 1936, Congress changed the name of the court to the District Court for the District of Columbia. The name changed to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in 1948. In 1954, the Supreme Court handed down its landmark decision in Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497 (1954), which desegregated public schools in the District of Columbia. In 1966, local school activist Julius Hobson sued the public school system, arguing that black-majority schools in the District of Columbia were being deprived of resources. He argued the judges were caught by a conflict of interest by appointing the BOE and then later ruling on desegregation lawsuits involving the city schools. In Hobson v. Hansen, 269 F.Supp. 401 (1967), the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in Hobson's favor. (An appeal by the superintendent of education failed in 1969.) The Hobson ruling led to widespread criticism of the existing BOE and governance structure of the D.C. public school system (some of it generated by the board itself). Post-home rule board of education President Lyndon B. Johnson abolished the commissioner system of government in 1967, creating a new mayor-council form of government (albeit one appointed by the President of the United States). The following year, Congress enacted legislation creating an 11-member elected Board of Education. Fifty-three candidates ran for election to the board. With no clear winners, a run-off election was held on November 26, 1968. Hobson himself was elected to the BOE as an at-large member in 1969. Congress made the mayor-council form of government permanent after passing the District of Columbia Home Rule Act in 1973, which provided for a publicly elected mayor and city council. With the city mismanaged and nearing bankruptcy, Congress enacted legislation in April 1995 creating the District of Columbia Financial Control Board. Budget authority over the public school system was stripped from the city, and given to the Control Board. That same year, under pressure from Congress, the Council of the District of Columbia enacted a package of educational reform proposals which included the establishment of charter schools in the District of Columbia for the first time. The reform legislation also created a new, independent District of Columbia Public Charter School Board to oversee these new schools. The Mayor of the District of Columbia was given authority to appoint the charter school board, although the BOE retained the power to issue charters for these schools. In November 1996, the Control Board seized control of the D.C. public school system. Superintendent Franklin L. Smith was fired, and Lt. Gen. Julius W. Becton, Jr. was hired as the new superintendent. The BOE was stripped of nearly all its authority, and a new, nine-member Emergency Transitional Education Board of Trustees (appointed by the Control Board) took control of the school system. With the city's finances stabilizing, Congress enacted the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997. The act allowed the Control Board to seize control of two-thirds of the city's agencies, and provided for restoration of local control of an agency only after the agency had achieved four successive balanced budgets. The Control Board hired Arlene Ackerman, a deputy superintendent of education in the Seattle public schools, as Becton's deputy superintendent and the system's new chief academic officer in July 1997. The same year, the Public Charter School Board began operation. The BOE's deliberations proved rancorous in 1998. Beginning in April 1998, the chairman of the council's education committee, Kevin P. Chavous, led a nine-month effort to reconstitute and reform the Board of Education. After a long battle with mayor-elect Anthony A. Williams and other council members, the Council approved a Chavous-backed plan to reduce the size of the board from 11 members to seven, and make four of the nine members subject to mayoral appointment (with council confirmation). Two of the city's political wards would elect a representative to the new board (for a total of four members), while two members and the board president would be elected at-large. Voters were asked to approve the \\"hybrid\\" board, which they did so in a close vote in June 2000.; The Control Board gave up its governance authority over the BOE in January 1999, after Anthony A. Williams when took office as mayor. Just nine months after taking up his second term in office, Mayor Williams introduced legislation to strip the BOE of nearly all its power, giving this to the mayor. Under Williams' proposal, the mayor would have the right to hire and fire the superintendent, principals, teachers, and other workers, and would gain significant new powers to reconstitute programs, operations, curriculum, and even entire schools. Chavous threw his support behind Williams' plan. Little action was taken, however, and in February 2004 Chavous said he no longer supported the mayor's bill. Chavous introduced his own legislation, which largely undid the 2000 reforms. The new bill provided for a nine-member board, with eight elected members (one from each ward) and one member elected at-large.; The council approved the bill in July 2004 on a close 7-to-6 vote.; Post-reform role of the SBOE The \\"Public Education Reform Act Amendments of 2007\\" (PERAA) replaced the existing Board of Education with a new State Board of Education (SBOE). The SBOE's role is to advise the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (another new body created by PERAA). Other duties and functions include: #Approve recommendations on academic standards as recommended by the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE); #Approve graduation standards for high school students; #Approve standards for the Certificate of High School Equivalency; #Approve definitions for \\"adequate yearly progress\\" (AYP) and \\"proficiency\\" and standards for \\"highly qualified teachers\\", all of which are applied to all local education agencies; #Approve standards for the accreditation of teacher preparation programs at the post-secondary level, and for the certification of teachers completing and graduating from such programs; #Approve the State Accountability Plan for D.C. public schools developed by OSSE, to ensure that AYP is achieved and all local education agencies held accountable for achievement of AYP; #Approve policies to ensure parental involvement in the governance of the public schools and in the education of students; #Approve policies for nongovernmental education service providers operating in the District of Columbia; #Approve rules under which student residency may be verified; #Approve those organizations permitted to accredit charter schools in the District of Columbia; #Approve the format of and categories for assessment for the annual student report card, to meet the requirements of the federal No Child Left Behind Act; #Approve those organizations permitted to accredit private placement in the District of Columbia; #Approve rules to enforce student attendance requirements; and #Approve the state standards under which home schooling may occur. OSSE and the SBOE collaborated on developing the District of Columbia's five-year strategic plan, which was required by PERAA. This plan, which covers education from early childhood to the 12th grade in all public schools (charter public schools included), was released in October 2008. D.C.

Her parents, Dale and Karen Bachman, were both avid hunters who took her on their hunting trips since she was five years old. She was not able to actually hunt until she was twelve, and had to do push-ups for over a year to develop the muscles to pull her bow. Later her parents would sign a work permit so she could start high school at 10 a.m., after hunting in the mornings. She attended Paynesville Area High School where she competed in pole vault for the track team, setting school and section 5A records. She served as student representative to the Chamber of Commerce board, winning an Outstanding Young Person award, played saxophone in the concert, pep, and marching bands, was homecoming queen, student council treasurer, a member of the National Honor Society, captain of track and speech teams, a lector in her Catholic church, and earned the Girl Scouts Gold Award by organizing younger Girl Scouts to interact with the elderly. Bachman graduated Paynesville Area High School magna cum laude in 2002, and attended St. Cloud State University with a double major in Spanish and Broadcast Journalism. She survived a likely bout with viral meningitis during a 2004 summer Spanish immersion program in Costa Rica. While pole vaulting in high school and college, Bachman would wrap her pole in camouflage to symbolize her passion for hunting.  Career  Melissa Bachman bowhunting in 2015 After graduating in 2006, Bachman sent out 76 video resumes without finding work, and had to take an unpaid internship with North American Media Group's North American Hunter Television in Minnetonka, driving round trip each day, and working nights as a waitress at a nightclub. Four months later she was hired as a full time producer for the show. She progressed to camera work, first by giving on-camera archery tips that other hunters were unwilling to, and later by filming and editing many of her own hunts to be aired for free, including a bow hunt of a 202 inch Illinois White-tailed deer. \\"Nobody turns down free work, I learned,\\" she says. As a camera professional, she shot, produced, and edited the first season of Mark Kayser's Extreme Pursuits program. In 2010, Bachman left NAMG to found her own production company named Deadly Passion Productions. She edited and did post-production work for hunting television shows including Dangerous Game, created online and instructional videos, led seminars on hunting at sports shows, managed social media sites, and wrote magazine articles. In January 2012, she returned to North American Hunter as a host. Among her work for NAH was a five-day-a-week video series called \\"My Take\\" with Melissa Bachman, that ran from February to August. In March 2012, Bachman took the world record for a red stag shot by a female archer in a New Zealand hunt. The hunt was aired both on \\"My Take\\" and on Winchester Deadly Passion. Melissa Bachman with SureShot Jewelry ammunition based necklace in 2015. The Winchester Deadly Passion program, also produced by North American Media Group, began airing in July 2012 on the Pursuit Channel, and was picked up by the Sportsman Channel for its third season, July 2014. It is named after and sponsored by Winchester Ammunition. In it, Melissa Bachman is filmed traveling the world to hunt animals using rifle, bow, or shotgun. Bachman stars in, produces, and edits the program herself. She works around 200 days a year in the field, switching between two cameramen who need more time off. In 2014, the program came out with a clothing line, and in 2015, Bachman sponsored an ammunition based jewelry line. Bachman struggles for an answer when asked about her life outside TV programs and hunting. \\"I can't even keep a plant alive ‚Äî that's how little I'm home,\\" she says.  Controversies over trophy hunting  On August 30, 2012, the National Geographic Channel were planning Bachman to be one of their contestants for the show that would become Ultimate Survival Alaska, until a Change.org petition to exclude her because of her hunting background received 13,000 signatures in under 24 hours. National Geographic's statement, in three Twitter posts, said she was eliminated because hunting was not the focus of the show. Conservationist Tim Martell, who launched the petition, had previously launched a Facebook campaign against Rosie O'Donnell for appearing with a hammerhead shark she had caught. Martell stated he did not oppose all hunting, primarily trophy hunting, which he considered wasteful. In November 2013, Bachman posted a photograph of herself smiling by the body of a lion, captioned \\"An incredible day hunting in South Africa! Stalked inside 60-yards on this beautiful male lion... what a hunt!\\" to her Twitter and Facebook accounts. The photo quickly drew Internet outrage, including multiple wishes for her death, comedian and animal welfare activist Ricky Gervais re-tweeting Bachman's message while adding \\"spot the typo\\", and an online petition from a Cape Town resident calling on the South African government to eject her from the country, which gathered hundreds of thousands of signatures. In reaction, Bachman temporarily deactivated her public Facebook and Twitter accounts. Many of the death threats instead went to an unrelated person with a similar name. The Maroi Conservancy, which facilitated the hunt through another outfitter in Zeerust, defended the hunt, stating it was both legal and ethical, and that food and funds from these kinds of hunts go to the struggling local community. International commentators claimed that the online anger directed at Bachman was extraordinary, sexist, and misogynist, and that evidence showed that banning hunting drives species extinct much more than controlled hunts do. At the time of the hunt, African lions were not listed as endangered under the United States Endangered Species Act, though their status was under reassessment and debate. Bachman did not directly comment in response to the controversies, though she has said that hate mail from anti-hunters was one thing she \\"could do without\\". In 2015, she stated, \\"No response at all seems to be the best. It doesn‚Äôt matter what you say, or how you say it, some people will always disagree and attack.\\"  References  External links  * Melissa Bachman Official site 1984 births Living people American hunters People from Stearns County, Minnesota St. Cloud State University alumni American television hosts American television producers American women television producers Girl Scouts who have earned the Gold Award Women television presenters ","title":"Melissa Bachman"},{"id":"48518414","text":"In Search of The Ultra-Sex is the English subtitled version of A la Recherche de l'Ultra-Sex, a 2015 French comedy film written, directed, edited and overdubbed by the comedy duo Nicolas & Bruno composed by Nicolas Charlet and Bruno Lavaine. Plot Science-fiction comedy of the XXX kind, In Search of The Ultra-Sex is inspired by a true story : A pandemic infects people everywhere with infinite lust, and the only ones who can save planet Earth are a crappy group of astronauts in space, led by Captain Cock, desperately looking for a solution! As the Galactic Confederation desperately tries to understand the reason behind this sudden madness, the horrifying truth is discovered by the FBI agents Bambi Darling and Stormy Brushing : The sexual matrix of the Universe known as the Ultra-Sex has been stolen! On board of starship \\"4skin 5\\", Captain Cock and his crew are missioned to solve the mystery and save Planet Earth from an endless orgy! About the film In Search of the Ultra-Sex (initially titled Message of Pornographic Nature : In Search of the Ultra-Sex) is a passion project for creators Nicolas Charlet and Bruno Lavaine who, to mark the anniversary of French channel Canal Plus in 2014,http://www.canalplus.fr/c-humour/pid7697-message-a-caractere- pornographique.html delved into the archives to create this cinematographic UFO: a crazy mach-up of around a hundred of (non explicit) excerpts from 100% pure vintage porn movies from the 70's and 80's, of which they re-dubbed all the characters, both male and female. Renewing the movie-hijacking tradition begun with Woody Allen's \\"What's Up, Tiger Lily?\\", In Search of Ultra-Sex is a hilarious, absurd, hallucinatory and very original journey into the best (and worst!) of porn golden-age gems, twisted on the same principle as their previous TV-show for Canal Plus, Message √† Caract√®re Informatif, in which they used to overdub corporate movies.https://www.vice.com/fr/read/message-a- caractere-informatif-909 But the fate of the film went far beyond a special TV broadcast and met an unexpected success in France. November 2014, after two exceptional screenings of the film at the Museum of Modern Art Palais de Tokyo in Paris, followed up with a Master Class before an audience of 500 people, the ARP (Actors, Directors and Producers Corporation), headed by Michel Hazanavicius, organizes a double special screening of Michel Hazanavicius's La Classe am√©ricaine and a new re-edited and remastered version of the Ultra-Sex for theaters. On June 5, 2015, a great evening event is organized around the film at the mythical Max Linder Panorama cinema, with animation provided by the Nicolas & Bruno themselves and a dubbing demonstration live by the famous French porn star Tabatha Cash and dubbing French actors Patrick Poivey (Bruce Willis), Lionel Henry (Eddy Murphy), Eric Missoffe (Scooby Doo) and Gilbert Levy (Moe The Simpsons), in front of 650 people. The Max Linder Panorama is sold out. Then many theaters asked to program the film around the country, extending the live happenings around the projections with a choreography of Daft-Peunk Robot (a character of the film) and a workshop where the public can come and try dubbing extracts of the Ultra-Sex. This is the beginning of a great tour: the Ultra-Sex- Tour.https://www.facebook.com/alarecherchedelultrasex/photos/a.862923750454177.1073741827.841031882643364/947786661967885/?type=3&theater; The film quickly becomes a cult-phenomenon, gathering a real fan community all around France. Everywhere, theaters program the movie, with sold-out projections in Lyon (outdoors at Transborder), Amiens, Poitiers, Marseilles, Metz, Montpellier, Villeneuve d'Ascq, Gueret, Lausanne, Avignon, Dunkerque, Toulouse, etc., and the Luminor in Paris where the film is in residence every Saturday evening from June, 2015. In the same time, the film received a great welcome abroad and has been selected in United States at the famous Fantastic Fest of Austin (Texas),http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/10/02/inside-the-year-s- craziest-sci-fi-sex-flick.html at the Beyond Fest of Hollywood at the American Cinematheque,http://fanboynation.com/in-search-of-the-ultra-sex-2015/ at the Ithaca International Fantastic Film Festival (New York), at the Grolandais International Film Festival of Toulouse, at the Buttocks Film Festival of Paris (as closing film), at the Bordeaux Independent International Film Festival, at the Franz√∂sische Filmtage T√ºbingen of Stuttgart, at the Zinema Zombie Fest of Bogota,http://www.zinemazombie.com/?p=783 at the Offscreen Festival of Brussels, at the Florida Film Festival of Maitland, at the Cinedelphia Film Festival of Philadelphia, at the Crossing Europe Film Festival of Linz, at the Slash 1/2 Festival of Vienna, at the Haapsalu Horror and Fantasy Film Festival of Tallinn, at the Bucheon Fantastic International Film Festival of Seoul, at the BAFICI of Buenos Aires, at the Fantasia festival of Montreal, at the Valletta film festival in Malta and at the Sci-Fi London Film Festival. November 2015, the mythical parisian theater Studio Galande programs In Search of the Ultra-Sex every Friday and Saturday night in residence, just before The Rocky Horror Picture Show, screened there for 35 years. The programmation continued at the Parisian theater Le Luminor Hotel de Ville every Saturday night during summer 2016 and 2017. In various interviews, Nicolas & Bruno mention many film festivals to come in United States and also the project to achieve an American version of the film dubbed with American voices. The film was selected at the 2017 My French Film Festival in the \\"Midnight screenings\\" category. It is subtitled in 9 languages: German / English / Spanish / French / Italian / Japanese / Polish / Portuguese / Russian.  Critical response  The film and the phenomenon that followed its programming in theaters, were critically acclaimed both in France and abroad. Since its first broadcast on Canal + and its projection at the Palais de Tokyo for the 30th anniversary of the channel, the film received very encouraging reviews: Les Inrockuptibles announces \\"the new crazy dubbed mach-up by the funniest duo in the country\\", while Le Monde relates \\"a guaranteed permanent burst of laughter\\". \\"An exhilarating return to their roots\\" according to So Film, in a long interview Nicolas & Bruno gave to the magazine. For T√©l√©rama magazine, \\"the story imagined by the two brats Charlet and Lavaine is an excuse for all sorts of tomfooleries\\", but specifies : \\"... much more funny than arousing!\\". The press seems to enjoy this unexpected and new mix of genres, L'Express magazine: \\"Through their film, Nicolas & Bruno celebrate not only the porn culture but also that of artistic hijacking\\". In Lib√©ration Didier P√©ron hails \\"a kitsch and crazy cinematographic hijacking, a sci-fi nutty pastiche\\". \\"American actresses hairstyles of the 80s are pornographic in itself, it's another world!\\" points out Frederic Tadde√Ø who interviewed Nicolas & Bruno on Europe-1 radio station, \\"It's a tribute to porn American cinema, as did Hazanavicius's The Artist with Hollywood movies\\". For Le Nouvel Obs magazine, \\"In search of the ultra-sex is a full of humor jewelry-box filled with sex maniac robots, unusual sex, absurd references and unbelievable blow-dries... go see it!\\" For his part, Vice highly recommends the film and explains how \\"putting a tape into a VCR and talk over it can have a huge humorous reach\\". An \\"Unidentified Filmic Object\\" according to AlloCin√© and Le Mouv' radio, \\"Nicolas & Bruno turn off the sound and let their delirious imaginations fly... script, dialogues, editing and even over-dubbing, these two guys can do almost everything.\\" Critics also commented on the programming and success of the film all around France and on the happenings that accompanied it. In her morning show on France-Inter Radio, Rebecca Manzoni celebrate \\"a both fascinating and hilarious undertaking, a singular destiny in the film industry : the movie lives its life in theaters, without any promotion, and owes its success just to the word of mouth.\\" A destiny largely relayed by the most followed bloggers: \\"A contagious film with hilarious punchlines, a killingly funny showing\\" acclaims GentleGeek, precising that \\"sharing and collective experience are part of the success of the film.\\" Super by Timai describes \\"600 people laughing non-stop for an hour and a half\\" about the special projection of the film at the Max Linder movie-theater, \\"the most WTF movie I've ever seen!\\" SuperBobine writes about an \\"unconventional adventure, a real gem of cinematographic hijacking.\\" \\"In search of the Ultra- Sex is a high-concentrate of LOL Blue and Z-movie, absolutely joyous!\\" posts the blogger Alexandre Hervaud. For his part, Oero33 order his readers to \\"go and see In search of the Ultra-Sex, preferably with friends!\\". For the first anniversary of the film, Brigitte Baronnet from AlloCin√© salutes its programing in residence at \\"the mythical parisian movie-theater Studio Galande, just before the eternal Rocky Horror Picture Show.\\" The film prompted a large enthusiasm among the international press, on the occasion of its programming in festivals. Time Out describes this \\"porn-stache gem\\" as a \\"priceless mashup, filled with Godardian editing, dirty irony and hairy surrealism\\", and the Swiss La Libert√© reports \\"one hour in fits of laughter\\". After watching it at the Fantastic Fest of Austin, The Daily Beast headlines \\"Inside the Year‚Äôs Craziest Sci-Fi Sex Flick!\\", and depicts \\"a brilliantly deranged 60-minutes space saga whose genius lies in its conception as a pasted-together pastiche of great-bad Golden Age porn, but how Charlet and Lavaine do the deed is a masterstroke in itself.\\" Twitch Film describes \\"one of the most unique and hilarious cinematic experiences of 2015, both smarter and dumber than it sounds.\\" FanboyNation magazine hails \\"a craft at hand in the editing as well as the absurd overdubs\\" in this \\"ultimate sex tape supercut\\". For his part, web-magazine PopOptiq headlines \\"Hilarious, raunchy, and extremely hairy, the #ULTRASEX is the perfect midnight aphrodisiac!\\". After the projection of the film at the American Cinematheque of Los Angeles, The Hollywood Reporter specifies \\"Only here, though, will viewers get to hear the Queen of England impatiently tell an aide, \\"Cut the salamu-alaykums, find me dwarves to f---.\\"  Extensions of the film  In November 2016, Nova Edition published a \\"Boovie\\" (book+movie) \\"A la Recherche de l'Ultra-sex\\", 208 pages, limited edition.

Other \\"suspicious and undesirable foreign men,\\" sometimes accused of common law crimes, were also interned. After France's entry into World War II, authorities transferred the men to the camp of le Vernet and began to intern \\"suspicious and undesirable foreign women\\" in October 1939. Following the Battle of France, Rieucros fell in the southern unoccupied zone and the Vichy regime assumed control of the camp from Third Republican authorities. In February 1942, authorities transferred the entire camp population of women and children to the camp of Brens. Background In the late 1930s, the French Third Republic increasingly restricted immigration as increasing numbers of political refugees fled ascendant European dictatorships.Timothy P. Maga, \\"Closing the Door: The French Government and Refugee Policy, 1933-1939,\\" in French Historical Studies: https://www.jstor.org/stable/286530 Prime Minister √âdouard Daladier of the Radical Party circumvented Parliament to issue a series of decree laws that closed avenues of legal immigration and punished illegal immigration in 1938 and 1939, reversing the nation's tradition of being a country of asylum.Otto Kirschheimer, \\"Decree Powers and Constitutional Law in France under the Third Republic,\\" in American Political Science Review: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1948192 Daladier's decree of November 12, 1938 gave the state the power to intern foreigners in camps. As the Spanish Civil War came to a close in the first months of 1939, the armies of soon to be dictator Francisco Franco drove nearly 500,000 refugees north across the border with France.Louis Stein, Beyond Death and Exile. The Spanish Republicans in France, 1939-1955 (1979) The French Third Republic responded by creating a series of internment camps to house and confine the refugees, the first of which was Rieucros.

The association engages in educational and commemorative activities, including preserving the site of the camp, creating informative historical plaques, and participating in an annual commemorative ceremony on July 16, the National Day of Remembrance for Victims of Racist and Antisemitic Persecution on the anniversary of the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup. Few traces remain of the camp. The barracks and barbed wire have disappeared. The most significant vestige of the camp today is a carved rock that depicts a soldier with a gun and the dates 1789 and 1939, marking the 150th anniversary of the French Revolution. A nearby rock bears the inscription \\"Gierke, Walter,\\" a former internee of the camp who may have sculpted the memorial.

Description The Great Psalms Scroll Qumran Cave 11 Entrance The scroll was discovered in February of the year 1956, ten years after the initial discovery of the scrolls. It was purchased by The Palestine Archaeological Museum located in Jerusalem and first unrolled in November 1961. Four fragments of this scroll were later purchased by the same museum. The scroll's physical make up is that of dark yellow animal hide and is a little less than 1 mm thick. The primary body of the manuscript consists of ‚Äú5 sheets of leather, still sewn together‚Äù, and is 4.253 meters in length. It is estimated to have been copied anywhere from 30-50 AD, and is written in Biblical style Hebrew. When rolled out, it forms a slight arc, and the top part is clean and well kept, while the bottom is decomposing significantly. It was first edited and published by James A. Sanders in 1965, with a second volume also published by Sanders two years later with a wider and more general audience in mind. The full scroll is published in the Leon Levy Dead Sea Scrolls Digital Library.  Shape and content of the 11Q5 Psalter  The reason this manuscript is of such great interest to scholars is due to its major deviance from the Masoretic Psalter. Its textual makeup is that of ‚Äúapocryphal compositions interspersed with canonical psalms in a radically different order‚Äù. It contains approximately fifty compositions, forty of which are found in the Masoretic text. While some maintain the masoretic order, such as some of the Psalms of Ascent, others are scattered throughout in a different order. Psalm 118 in the 11Q5 Manuscript 11Q5 has generated a lot of interest in scholars due to its large difference from the Masoretic Psalter, ‚Äúboth in ordering of contents and in the presence of additional compositions.‚Äù It contains several compositions that are not present in the Masoretic Psalter of 150 hymns and prayers and therefore, ‚Äúchallenges traditional ideas concerning the shape and finalization of the book of Psalms‚Äù There are eight non-Masoretic compositions with an additional prose composition that is not formatted like a psalm. Three highlighted compositions include ‚ÄúThe Apostrophe to Zion‚Äù, ‚ÄúPlea for Deliverance‚Äù, and Psalm 151; in addition, the prose composition is researched to be known as ‚ÄúDavid‚Äôs Compositions.‚Äù While these are non-Masoretic, some of them, Psalm 151, was known in the Septuagint. The Apostrophe to Zion, written as a love poem to Zion, is one of two non-Masoretic compositions that are complete in the Great Psalm Scroll. It has the ‚Äúsame style as three biblical apostrophes in Isaiah 54:1-8, 60:1-22, 62:1-8‚Äù and another copy of this composition can be found in 4Q88. The Plea for Deliverance, found in column 19, was a psalm unknown before the discovery of 11Q5, where neither the beginning nor the end of the poem can be found, except some twelve lines of the same psalm found in 11Q6. It is a prayer for deliverance from sin and Satan, giving thanks for experiences in the past while using biblical vocabulary, style, and form. Scholars have found it very difficult to date this psalm. Psalm 151 in the 11Q5 Manuscript.The traditional Hebrew Bible and the Book of Psalms contains 150 psalms, but Psalm 151 is found both in The Great Psalms Scroll and the Septuagint, as both end with this psalm. Scholars have found it fascinating having both the Greek and Hebrew translation of this psalm, helping to understand the different techniques of the different translators. However, the Septuagint version is short and scarce with only one composition of 7 verses, whereas 11Q5 has two compositions. Psalm 151A and 151B (Hebrew) and 151 (Greek) are the only psalms considered to be autobiographical in terms of relating to events in David's life. The version of Psalm 151, discovered at Qumran, adopts a more biographical tone, giving it the sound of a hymn associated with the figure of David. The additional prose composition is also known as David's Compositions. It references many Psalms associated with David, including 364 songs for each day of the year, conforming to calendars found in distinctively sectarian texts among the Dead Sea Scrolls. These songs were hymns attributed to King David, praising him for composing the Psalms, classifying the hymns and prayers he wrote. According to this list, David composed 3,600 psalms, 364 songs to be performed each day of the year during regular sacrifices, another 52 songs for the weekly Sabbath sacrifice, 30 songs for sacrifices of annual festivals and the new moon, and 4 songs for the sick. Therefore, 11Q5 concludes with the bold statement that David was an avid sage and hymnist, crafting upwards of 4,050 psalms.  Status at Qumran  There are many theories as to the function and status of the 11Q5 scroll at Qumran. In that it varies so much from the Masoretic Psalter, the general consensus seems to be that the Psalter canon had not been entirely fixed at this point and that this manuscript was part of a more \\"living corpus\\". However, various theories, including those of James A. Sanders, M. H. Goshen-Gottstein, Patrick Skehan and Peter Flint, argue for different purposes or functions of the scroll. James Sanders proposed that this manuscript contained an arrangement created prior to the fixation of the Masoretic Psalter of 150 Psalms. He thought that the first half of the Masoretic Psalter, Psalm 1-89, had been finalized but that the second half, while still considered canonical at Qumran, was quite fluid. In contrast, M. H. Goshen-Gottstein proposed that the scroll is a secondary liturgical collection based on the already standardized Masoretic Psalter. Patrick W. Skehan also argued that it is a secondary collection grouped for liturgical purposes. Peter Flint suggested that the scroll is a collection of 52 psalms, in correlation with the 52 weeks of the solar calendar, with 4 extra pieces arguing David's authorship. Due to the large number of Psalms scrolls found at Qumran and the references to the Psalms in other sectarian works, there is formal and functional evidence suggesting that the Psalms were viewed as scripture by the Qumran community and that the strong Davidic emphasis in this particular scroll correlates with the community's messianic hopes and expectations.

It aired on December 2, 2015 on the cable network FX. This episode was written by Ryan Murphy and directed by Loni Peristere. Plot Det. John Lowe recalls seeing Wren in a glass coffin in Hotel Cortez. He returns there and demands to know the truth from Liz Taylor. Sally leads him to Room 64 to find answers. There, behind the armoire, John finds the preserved body parts from the victims of the Ten Commandments Killer. Sally convinces John that he is the new Ten Commandment Killer, following the path set by James March. John goes to the hospital and meets Hahn. He confesses to being the Ten Commandment Killer and has regained his memories. He had first visited Cortez in 2010, where Donovan had taken him to March's dinner party with Elizabeth. March was so impressed by John that he sent Elizabeth away to spend quality time with him. Once John passed out, March discussed John's potential as a protege with Elizabeth. She agreed to abduct Holden to prepare John for his destiny with March. In the aftermath of Holden's disappearance, John frequently visits the Hotel to meet March and to continue an ongoing sexual relationship with Sally. During one visit, March shows John his trophy room. To satiate his hunger for injustice, March suggests a target to John: Martin Gamboa, who checked in and molested a ten- year-old boy, and left behind Polaroids of their sexual activity. John visits Gamboa and beats him to death with the Oscar statue, (originally sent to him at the police station), before trying to hang himself. March saves him and reprimands Sally for failing to do so. Sally and March help John cope with his murder of Gamboa, and March shows him the legacy of the Ten Commandments Killer which he wants John to finish. John appoints himself as lead investigator of the case with no knowledge that he is the actual killer. Sally provides the next target to John: an adulterous couple who had checked in the Cortez. March also explains to him that the Cortez cannot be linked to the crimes, so John set up the lovers to stage their murder elsewhere. Hahn drapes the sheet over Wren's corpse, unwilling to believe that his partner is the killer. John says that Hahn is wrong, and stabs him with an autopsy tool with an admonition not to covet his neighbor's wife; John had confirmed that Hahn had been lusting after Alex Lowe. Returning to the Hotel, John encounters Iris, and tells her that he remembers everything. She is relieved, as she was never sure whether he would and was always tempted to explain it all to him. Then he demands the key to Room 64. Inside, he and March place Hahn's severed penis and testicles in the trophy case. Reception \\"The Ten Commandments Killer\\" was watched by 2.31 million people during its original broadcast, and gained a 1.2 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49.

The critical consensus reads: \\"Angela Bassett shines as Ramona Royale in \\"She Wants Revenge,\\" but her story arc feels forced this late in the season of Hotel.\\" Alex Stedman from Variety believed that \\"the aptly titled \\"She Wants Revenge\\" moves the plot quickly in ways that few episodes before it have\\", complimenting the plotline as well as the upcoming expectations the episode enabled. Michael Calia from The Wall Street Journal commented that \\"[a]fter getting lost in Det. John Lowe's long, strange, bloody and warped trip last time, AHS: Hotel turned its attention back to the character at the center of it all, Lady Gaga's the Countess. This week's episode, \\"She Wants Revenge\\", casts the Countess as an immortal on a mission. Well, make that several missions.\\" Matt Fowler from IGN was also of the same opinion, saying, \\"Hotel sobered up this week, peeling itself away from its current streak of enjoyable-but-masturbatory flashbacks to coldly remind us that the beating heart of this season is an unfathomably dull vampire story.\\" Writing for the Den of Geek, Ron Hogan observed, \\"One of the interesting choices in this episode, written by Brad Falchuk, is that it's communicated mostly through voiceovers. We see montages of characters doing acts, but most of what we actually hear is from a recording booth.\\" He complimented Michael Uppendahl's direction as well as some of the visuals of the episode. Brian Moylan from New York Daily News rated the episode 3 out of 5 stars, saying that \\"[the] episode certainly took a hard left turn, didn't it?... Sure, there's plenty of killing and bloodletting, but not even a single measly Seven rip-offs.\\" Moylan believed that the unnecessary bits of the episode, including the sub-plot regarding the porn filming, were adequately mixed in the main story. E.A. Hanks from The New York Times believed that \\"She Wants Revenge\\" \\"returned to one of this season's most interesting themes ‚Äì how love and hate can be bedfellows.\\" Darren Franich from Entertainment Weekly observed that \\"[the episode] was at the point of an American Horror Story season when the players on the final-act chessboard start moving into position\\". Emily Stephens from The A.V. Club stated, \\"A lot of the details in \\"She Wants Revenge\\" seem beside the point, too little too late, and uncomfortably low on results\\". She especially criticized the under-utilization of Angela Bassett and her \\"confusing\\" storyline. Ryan Sandoval reviewed the episode for TV.com and criticized the excessive monologues as well as the episode being \\"a regular soap opera this week on American Horror Story: Hotel, complete with betrayals, broken hearts, dramatic revelations, and thwarted revenge plots, all taking place on the Countess's wedding day no less\\". Ross Bonaime from Paste rated the episode 6.8 out of 10, saying, \\"Everyone makes mistakes, but in American Horror Story case, it seems like its own mistakes could have been solved with a bit more planning and foresight.

National politics (1876‚Äì99) Dev√®s was elected as a deputy for B√©ziers on 20 February 1876, and sat with the Republican Left. He was reelected after the house was dissolved on 14 October 1877. He was reelected in the second round on 4 September 1881, then resigned and ran successfully for election for Bagn√®res-de-Bigorre on 18 December 1881. He was Minister of Agriculture from 14 November 1881 to 26 January 1882 in the cabinet of L√©on Gambetta. His ministry was created by Gambetta with the aim of rallying the peasants to the Republican cause. Dev√®s was Minister of Justice and Religion from 7 August 1882 to 28 January 1883 in the cabinet of Charles Duclerc, then Minister of Justice from 29 January 1884 to 20 February 1883 in the cabinet of Armand Falli√®res. On the issue of the naturalization of Algerian Jews, Dev√®s made a tacit concession to antisemitism in Algeria and France. He favored a literal interpretation of the 1870 Cr√©mieux decree, which supported naturalization of Jews in the areas of Algeria that were departments in 1870, but not in the M'zab protectorate in the south. In the elections of 4 October 1885 Dev√®s ran on the Republican list for Hautes-Pyr√©n√©es and was not elected. He again failed to be elected on 13 December 1885 in the Seine department. On 29 August 1886 he was elected senator for the Cantal department, and sat with the Left. He was reelected on 7 January 1894. He held office until 1 January 1899. Paul Dev√®s died in Paris on 12 November 1899 at the age of 62.

Structure The CHCHD10 gene is located on the q arm of chromosome 22 at position 11.23 and it spans 2,138 base pairs. The CHCHD10 gene produces a 14.9 kDa protein composed of 149 amino acids. It is enriched at cristae junctions in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria. The structure of the protein contains a nonstructured N-terminal region, a hydrophobic helix and a C-terminal CHCH domain which contains a Cx(9)C motif and two additional cysteines. A total of four cysteines are predicted to form two disulfide bonds. Function This gene encodes for a mitochondrial protein that is enriched at cristae junctions in the intermembrane space. It may play a role in cristae morphology maintenance or oxidative phosphorylation. Clinical significance CHCHD10-related disorders include Myopathy, isolated mitochondrial, autosomal dominant (IMMD), Frontotemporal dementia and/or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 2 (FTDALS2) Frontotemporal dementia and/or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 2 (FTDALS2), Spinal muscular atrophy, Jokela type (SMAJ). Frontotemporal dementia and/or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 2 (FTDALS2) Frontotemporal dementia and/or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 2 (FTDALS2) is a neurodegenerative disorder with high intrafamilial variation with phenotypes such as frontotemporal dementia and/or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Frontotemporal dementia is characterized by frontal and temporal lobe atrophy associated with neuronal loss, gliosis, and dementia. Patients exhibit progressive changes in social, behavioral, and/or language function. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is characterized by the death of motor neurons in the brain, brainstem, and spinal cord, resulting in fatal paralysis. Spinal muscular atrophy, Jokela type (SMAJ) Spinal muscular atrophy, Jokela type (SMAJ) is an autosomal dominant, slowly progressive, lower motor neuron disease. SMAJ is characterized by adult-onset of muscle cramps and fasciculations affecting the proximal and distal muscles of the upper and lower limbs. The disorder results in weakness and mild muscle atrophy later in life. Myopathy, isolated mitochondrial, autosomal dominant (IMMD) Myopathy, isolated mitochondrial, autosomal dominant (IMMD) is a mitochondrial myopathy presenting with severe exercise intolerance, progressive proximal weakness, and lactic acidemia. The disorder is slowly progressive, with later involvement of facial muscles, muscles of the upper limbs, and distal muscles. Others Mutations in CHCHD10 has also been found to be associated with cerebellar ataxia, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and other mitochondrial diseases.

She started her career in journalism, working at People magazine and InStyle, and was editor-in-chief at Us Weekly from 2002 to 2009. As an executive, she revamped entertainment industry publications The Hollywood Reporter and Billboard. Early life Janice Min, the youngest of three children, was born in Atlanta, to Nungsun Min, an IRS agent, and Hong Min, a zoology professor turned businessman. Her father taught at the University of Georgia and later became an executive for a medical supply company. Min's parents emigrated to the United States from Seoul, South Korea. Min grew up mostly in Littleton, Colorado, where her family moved just before she started first grade. She excelled in school, skipping third grade and graduating high school at age 16. As a child, Min was a fan of journalist Connie Chung. Min said her parents were \\"oddly permissive\\" of her interest in journalism for Asian-American immigrants. Min also had an interest in fashion, ever since she was a little girl. When Min was 13, she lied about her age, saying she was 14, to get a job at McDonald's. In middle school and at Heritage High School, she contributed to the schools' student newspapers. Min worked at a clothing store in a local mall, became a cashier at Target, and sold cosmetics at Foley's during a summer break in college. She interned one summer at MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour. Min moved to New York City to attend Columbia University when she was 16. There she met her future husband, Peter Sheehy, and graduated in 1990 with a degree in history. She also obtained a master's degree in journalism from the same university. Career=Early work Min began her journalism career in 1991 as a reporter for The Reporter-Dispatch in Westchester County, New York. She covered the crime beat, as well as local school board and planning committee meetings, among other topics. Min joined People magazine in 1993 as a staff writer. She did not have an interest in celebrity gossip, but was looking for a job and had a friend that worked there. At first, Min struggled at People. According to one of her former coworkers, she was a \\"poor writer\\". Paula Chin, then-senior editor of the magazine, mentored her. Min became better suited for the position as People began to focus on lighter stories. She covered fashion for the \\"Style Watch\\" section, which became a regular weekly feature. Min was promoted to senior editor in 1997. After five years at People, Min left the paper and briefly joined Life Magazine as the assistant managing editor. According to Adweek, she was \\"bored and miserable\\" at Life, because of the slower pace of a monthly publication. Min left in 1998, after less than a year at Life, to work for InStyle under the same job title. There she led the development of InStyle Weddings and InStyle Makeover. In 2001, Min quit InStyle and started looking for another position. Us Weekly In 2002, Min applied for the editor-in-chief position at Us Weekly and was instead hired as an executive editor under Bonnie Fuller, who became editor- in-chief. The following July, Fuller resigned and Min was appointed to take her place. According to The New York Times, Min turned Us Weekly into one of the magazine industry's \\"major success stories\\". Public interest in celebrity news was growing, as was the magazine's circulation. In her role at Us Weekly, Min had a significant impact on popular culture and was influential in creating an industry for celebrity gossip. For example, Us Weekly was largely responsible for the popularity of the reality TV show about a couple with eight children, Jon & Kate Plus 8, after it featured John and Kate on the cover of eight sequential issues. Min focused much of the publication's editorial on reality TV stars, rather than actors and singers. According to Adweek, Min positioned celebrities as the reader's friend who \\"can take a little good-natured ribbing\\" and fostered more cooperative relationships with celebrities. According to Elle, Min depicted celebrities as people that \\"may make dumb, even craven, moves, but are never villains\\". According to The Los Angeles Times, Min \\"softened the tone and made it much more friendly to stars\\". Min also created a calmer environment in the workplace, which had previously been dramatic and contentious. Under Min's tenure, the publication's circulation grew from 800,000 copies per week in 2000 to 1.9 million by 2009. Min had negotiated a contract that partially tied her compensation to the number of magazines sold. As distribution increased, her salary peaked at $2 million a year. She left in August 2009 as her contract was up for renewal and ad revenues at the publication were decreasing. For her work at Us Weekly, Min was named AdWeek magazine's Editor of the Year. While in-between jobs, Min received job offers from women's magazines, but was not interested. She spent ten months with her family. Min was influential in creating an interest in celebrity pregnancies in popular culture through her work at Us Weekly. Shortly after she left, Min got a deal with St. James Press to write a book, How to Look Hot in a Minivan: A Real Woman's Guide to Losing Weight, Looking Great, and Dressing Chic in the Age of the Celebrity Mom. In August 2012, she wrote a column in The New York Times complaining about unrealistic weight and beauty expectations for new moms, set by celebrities. She was criticized in blogs and social media for criticizing an aspect of popular culture she helped establish. Min said the magazine was responding to reader interests, not creating them. The Hollywood Reporter and Billboard Janice Min in her Los Angeles officeIn December 2009, the CEO of Prometheus Global Media, Richard Beckman, acquired The Hollywood Reporter. According to The Daily Beast, The Hollywood Reporter was \\"in a death spiral\\". It had become too friendly to the celebrities it covered and was losing readership to competitor Daily Variety. After seeing in The New York Post that Min was moving to Los Angeles, Beckman began courting her to lead the publication's turnaround. She was named editorial director of The Hollywood Reporter in May 2010. Four months after Min took the position, The Hollywood Reporter was re-launched as a weekly, glossy magazine. She focused the publication's editorial on in-depth feature stories and visuals. According to The New York Times, \\"she published 3,000-word profiles of and about Hollywood, plus plenty of juicy photo galleries and lighter items\\" as opposed to \\"quick blurbs about comings and goings\\". She avoided the re-written press releases and industry jargon that were common in prior issues. Some of the subjects upon which she focused included box office numbers, controversies, fashion and personal celebrity news. Min created art and photography departments and hired more journalists. The publication also began hosting Oscar and Emmy award parties for nominees. Min led the modernization of the publication's website as well. The Hollywood Reporter web traffic increased 800 percent under her tenure at the publication and revenue increased 50 percent. In January 2014, Min was promoted to co-president/chief creative officer of the Entertainment Group of Guggenheim Media. In this role she became the head of both The Hollywood Reporter and Billboard. Billboard was still considered the most reputable magazine in the music industry, but it was losing readers and writers due to a tumult in the music industry. Min was appointed to lead a similar turnaround as the one she facilitated at The Hollywood Reporter.  Quibi  In 2018, Janice Min joined Quibi, Jeffrey Katzenberg's video startup business, to lead its daily news shows rubric called Daily Essentials. In September 2019, Min exited Quibi, ahead of its April 2020 launch. Personal life Janice Min currently resides in Los Angeles, with her husband, Peter Sheehy, who is director of a nonprofit organization called KidUnity. They have three children - Lila, Tate and Will. In 2019, it was reported that Min purchased an $8 million mansion located in Brentwood, Los Angeles. She previously bought two properties in the Pacific Palisades in 2010 and 2017 respectively.

Born Thelma Mae Robertson to Scottish parents in Montr√©al, Qu√©bec,1921 Census of Canada she was the niece of Clark Griffith, a former star pitcher who became manager (1912‚Äì20) and then president and chief stockholder of the Washington Senators (1920 until his death in 1955). The Senators relocated to Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul in the autumn of 1960 and have been known as the Minnesota Twins since 1961. Haynes' father, James Robertson, was a Canadian minor league baseball player who died in 1922, leaving behind a widow and seven young children. Clark Griffith's wife, Anne (\\"Addie\\"), James Robertson's sister, took in the destitute survivors, and the family moved from Montr√©al to Washington, D.C., with eldest son Calvin Robertson and Thelma assuming the Griffith surname. Calvin Griffith was groomed to succeed his uncle, who was childless, as the Senators' president and de facto general manager. In October 1955, Clark Griffith died at age 85, leaving his 52 percent majority interest in the Senators evenly split between Calvin and Thelma. She served as treasurer and executive vice president of the Twins and, with her brother, ensured that the Griffith-Robertson family would control the operation of the team until it was purchased on August 15, 1984, by Carl Pohlad; the family's share of the Twins reportedly was sold for $32 million. Thelma wed a former Washington pitcher, Joe Haynes of the Chicago White Sox, in 1941. Joe would later return to the Senators/Twins as a player, coach and front office executive until his death in January 1967. Their son, Bruce Haynes, also was an executive with the Twins' franchise.

It was the most well-known struggle among those that developed in the Pyrenees in the 19th century. A demoiselle is a young woman. The name guerre des demoiselles comes from the fact that the countrymen disguised themselves as women, with long white shirts or sheep skins, scarves or wigs, and blacked or concealed faces. This disguise was for attacking‚Äîmostly at night‚Äîlarge property owners, forest guards and gendarmes, ironmasters, and charcoal burners. Cause The rebellion was due to the passing, on 27 May 1827, of a new forestry code, which was applied from 1829 onwards. This new code imposed \\"new regulations of forest usage, in particular concerning gathering of wood, wood cutting, and above all pasturing (forbidden from now on), the rights of maronnage, hunting, fishing, and gathering.\\" These regulations prohibited what the local people saw as their traditional right to use the forest for pasturing their animals and gathering food. This led to a campaign of civil disobedience in which men dressed as women to hide their identities and which came to be known as the War of the Maidens (la guerre des demoiselles). Unfolding=Castillonnais and the Massat valley (1829‚Äì1830) Between spring 1829 and spring 1830, the revolts were very numerous (between 300‚Äì400 individuals, according to the proc√®s-verbal) and the Maidens came out very frequently. The troubles were concentrated in 2 regions: first the Castillonnais to the south-west of Saint-Girons, until December 1829; and afterwards the valley of Massat, in January 1830. From spring 1830, the revolt extended to the entirety of the department. During this period, the Maidens did not make any claims of a social character. They took issue with everyone who prevented their free use of the forest‚Äîguards, gendarmes, and charcoal burners. Resistance to livestock seizures (in guarded areas of the forest) was the first large scale activity of the Maidens. Despite the efforts of Castillonnais municipal councils to defend the peasants' rights through the legal process, on May 22, 1829, the Maidens chased forest guards out of their homes with shouting and gunfire. They appeared again during a seizure operation, in the forest of Saint-Lary, between May 25‚Äì30, 1829. Twenty forest guards, having surprised six trespassing shepherds with their flocks, wanted to seize the livestock; but they quickly found themselves facing a crowd of a hundred disguised and armed countrymen who insulted them, threw stones at them, and even shot at them. Terrified and powerless, the guards retreated. In July 1829, incidents of this type multiplied and gendarme reinforcements‚Äîfour brigades, two patrolling Castillonnais and Bellongue, two patrolling Saint- Gironnais‚Äîdid not prevent the insurrection from spreading. The revolts used guerilla tactics consisting of avoiding direct engagement with the enemy in favor of skirmishes with forest guards. In mid-August 1829, a new attempt to seize livestock in Bellongue, close to the small village of Buzan, caused one of the largest confrontations of the year. On the 16th of this month, an inspector, two surveyors, and many guards and forest agents coming to mark out an area in the Buzan forest, discovered two flocks of sheep trespassing. Their shepherds refused to give their identity and were tied up to be sent to jail. Soon, many inhabitants of neighboring villages and communities, who were present during the altercation, aggressively demonstrated their discontent. Church bells were rung, alerting neighboring inhabitants. A furious army of Maidens, armed with batons, scythes and guns, intervened and freed the prisoners. A few days later, when the gendarmes arrived to arrest the two shepherds, a new and more menacing rebel army forced them back. During spring 1829, the Maidens also confronted charcoal burners, accused of exploiting trees. In June, charcoal burners were the target of violence in Sentein, in the Biros valley; and afterwards in July in Ustou, in the south of Saint- Gironnais. Charcoal burner lodges were burned, their cabins and their objects destroyed, and they suffered multiple gunshots. In the night of August 29, the Maidens invaded the forest of Augirein, in Bellelongue, used by charcoal burners of the Engomer forge. In November, a sign warned Buzan charcoal burners to leave the forest or face the consequences. The hostility of the Maidens continued until spring 1830, when in the April of that year some 30 charcoal burners were injured and forced to flee in the forest of Saint-Lary. Forest guards, insulted, abused, and terrorized, were equally the target of Maidens. On December 17, 1829, guards of the Autrech valley, in the Saint-Lary commune, decided to cease their service after being threatened by 15 Maidens armed with axes. On January 21, 1830, a guard from the Lafont de Sentenac family was injured by a blow to the head with an axe, and threats against forest guards increased in intensity. The revolt started to spread from Massat to the massif of Arize. Also, a band of Maidens surrounded the house of Delpla-Roquemaurel and chased their private guards out. From January to May 1830, their actions multiplied. On January 27, the Maidens plundered the Laffon tower, at Boussenac, that served as a shelter for guards. On February 17, they wrecked the home of one of them at Bern√®de. On March 29, 200 Maidens summoned the mayor of Riv√®renert to deliver the guards to them. At last, in the night of May 10‚Äì11, a hundred Maidens shot at the house of a guard at Saleich, 10 km south of Sailes-du-Salat, in Haute-Garonne. The guard shot and killed a 20 year old attacker. These simple and direct actions, brought against all who infringed on their free use of the forest, became popular very quickly, and the movement was not slow to spread to the neighboring regions in the Ari√®ge department. Propagation of the revolt (1830‚Äì1832) Encouraged by the success of the first guerilla actions, the revolt propagated in the Arbas valley (in Haute-Garonne), and in Ari√®ge (in the Cabannes canton and the Ax region). From the beginning of January 1830, a good part of the Ari√®ge department was in unrest, and the Maidens carried out many shows of force. On January 24, at Balagu√®res (Castillonnais), the day of the local festival, they paraded in the streets armed with axes and guns to the sound of an oboe and a drum. Three days later, 400‚Äì500 Maidens paraded at Massat while crying \\"Down with forest guards!\\" On February 17, their numbers nearly doubled and the mayor barely avoided a confrontation. These demonstrations show the support that the Maidens had among the population and local authorities, such as mayors. Troops sent to suppress them were ineffective, because the guerilla actions were sporadic and occurred in mountainous, poorly known territory. In 1829 and 1830, the authorities were barely alarmed by this revolt, because the Maidens‚Äô demands did not seem exorbitant. From summer 1830, the Maidens‚Äô actions became more violent and extended to the entirety of Ari√®ge. They were directed mainly at ironmasters. On September 27, a departmental forest commission was put in place. The troubles ceased. They restarted in November and continued until March 1831. In May 1832, new violence erupted in Ustou. Sporadic troubles (1833‚Äì1872) The troubles continued in a sporadic manner in the following years, until 1872. Studies Many studies have been done on this subject. The earliest was that of Prosper Barousse, published in 1839.Prosper Barousse, Les Demoiselles, La Mosa√Øque du Midi, 1839, pp. 1-9. More poet than historian, Barousse described the legends that surrounded the Maidens‚Äô exploits from an early date. Due to their widespread use of horns and their communication by smoke signals, the Ari√®ge rebels were described as truly organized and disciplined forces obeying warlords. Barousse contributed to popularizing the myth of Jean Vidalou, the poor shepherd who became the great general of the Maidens. The Maidens supposedly received their instructions from a mysterious person with whom they met during the night. Barousse, who took serious liberties with history, thus forged an image of a leader who was out of the ordinary. However, he was not the first to exploit the Ari√®ge revolt for literary ends. The first truly historic study on this subject was that of Michel Dubedat, in 1900. Short and incomplete, little different from the spirit of its predecessor, it nevertheless brought a global perspective of the events.Michel Dubedat, \\"Le Proc√®s des Demoiselles : r√©sistance √† l'application du Code forestier dans les montagnes de l'Ari√®ge (1828‚Äì1830)\\", Bulletin de la soci√©t√© ari√©geoise des sciences lettres et arts, 1899‚Äì1900, pp. 281-295. Around 1930, Ren√© Dupont took up the subject again with the goal of doing a rigorously historic study by scrutinizing the departmental archives of Ari√®ge. He succeeded in reconstructing in great detail the chronology of the troubles and in presenting an interpretation for them. His work was abundantly reused in the studies which followed.Ren√© Dupont, La Guerre des Demoiselles dans les for√™ts de l'Ari√®ge (1829‚Äì1831), Travaux du laboratoire forestier de Toulouse, t. 1, article 27, Toulouse, 1933, 82 p. Also, a doctoral thesis titled \\"D√©lits forestiers et troubles politiques dans les Pyr√©n√©es centrales de 1827 √† 1851\\" (\\"Forestry offences and political troubles in the central Pyrenees from 1827 to 1851\\"), relying on new evidence from the National Archives, was written by Louis Clarenc at the University of Toulouse. In 1969, Fran√ßois Baby studied one aspect of this revolt: the role of folklore. The result of his study was a memoir published in 1972.Fran√ßois Baby, La Guerre des Demoiselles en Ari√®ge (1829‚Äì1872), Paris, Montbel, 1972 Jean-Fran√ßois Soulet placed the War of the Maidens in a popular protest movement of the Pyrenees world. He cast the revolt in new light by considering it as one of the protests, already ancient, of civil society against the centralizing enterprise of the state. His work showed that the War of the Maidens should be considered as \\"one link in a long chain of revolts starting well before 1829, continuing well after 1831, and engaging at one moment or another almost all of the Pyrenean valleys.\\" Jean-Fran√ßois Soulet, Les Pyr√©n√©es au XIXe si√®cle: l'√©veil d'une soci√©t√© civile, Lu√ßon, Sud Ouest, 2004, p. 708. Theater and cinema This rebellion inspired, in 1830, the play Le Drame des Demoiselles, which played in the Th√©√¢tre des Vari√©t√©s in Paris. In 1983, Jacques Nichet directed a 90-minute feature film entitled La Guerre des Demoiselles. In 1976, Gerard Guillaume and Jeanne Labrune directed a feature film (two episodes) entitled La Guerre des Demoiselles, set in Massat with professional actors and local contributors. It was at once an essay on collective memory and an activist voice against the Haute-Ari√®ge national park bill. The film was only broadcast once, but it was enthusiastically received among locals during private screenings following animated debates. The thesis of Francois Baby was the historic thread establishing a parallel between the revolt of countrymen in the 19th century and the current trend of protest, dominated by occitanistes, with its epicenter in Larzac. The film is available in the archives of the Institut national de l'audiovisuel. NotesFurther reading Sahlins, Peter (1994). Forest Rites: the War of the Demoiselles in Nineteenth-Century France. .

From Bryan to Stalin is the first volume of political memoirs published by the American radical trade union organizer William Z. Foster (1881--1961). The book was written by Foster during his lengthy recuperation from a heart attack and mental breakdown suffered in 1932 and 1933. The book was published in 1937 by International Publishers, a Marxist publishing house closely associated with the Communist Party, USA, an organization for which Foster ran three times as candidate for President of the United States. Foster's 352-page memoir has come to be regarded as an important historical source for students of early 20th Century syndicalism and communism in the United States, and has been extensively employed in the writing of several biographies of the author. Publication history=Background American Communist Party leader William Z. Foster (1881-1961) suffered from a serious heart ailment ever since symptoms of angina pectoris began to first appear on the campaign trail in June 1932.Edward P. Johanningsmeier, Forging American Communism: The Life of William Z. Foster. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1994; pg. 266. An exhausting travel schedule that took him 30,000 miles and place him before more than 100 crowds ‚Äî events which included arrests in Los Angeles and Lawrence, Massachusetts ‚Äî exacerbated Foster's existing health condition. On September 8, 1932, Foster collapsed from a severe heart attack in Moline, Illinois which nearly claimed Foster's life. The crisis left Foster weak and bedridden, with only a telephone statement to a final Communist Party election rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City deemed possible during the final two months of the 1932 campaign.Johanningsmeier, Forging American Communism, pp. 266-267. Foster found himself separated from politics for nearly a year, with political news and party newspapers kept away from him upon the advice of his physician. Accompanying his heart ailment came a mental breakdown which further sapped Foster's energy and activity.Johanningsmeier, Forging American Communism, pg. 267. In search of a cure, in the Summer of 1933 Foster traveled to the Soviet Union, where he was placed in a series of three different health care facilities, with his mental state only deteriorating further, with his daughter bringing him home to the USA in January 1934. Again on the advice of his doctor, Foster was moved out of the Communist Party hub of New York City, this time to the home of a relative in comparatively placid San Francisco, California, located on the opposite coast. Foster remained ill, physically and mentally, until late in 1935, when a return to active political life was finally made. It was during this long recuperation process in 1934 and 1935 that Foster began work on his autobiography, an effort that was ultimately published in two volumes as From Bryan to Stalin (1937) and Pages from a Worker's Life (1939).Johanningsmeier, Forging American Communism, pg. 269. Release Portrait of American Communist trade union leader William Z. Foster. From Bryan to Stalin was released in the spring of 1937 by International Publishers, a New York City- based publishing house closely tied to the Communist Party, USA. The book did not cross over to achieve mainstream publishing success, but was restricted instead to a relatively limited circulation among radical political activists. Contents Calling Foster \\"the most important figure in the American Communist Party,\\" Brooklyn Daily Eagle reviewer John Barbash noted that From Bryan to Stalin was effectively composed of \\"two distinct parts\\" ‚Äî the first dealing with Foster's trade union and political activities prior to his joining the Communist Party of America in 1921 and the second dealing with his various activities as an active participant in the American Communist movement.John Barbash, \\"Autobiography of an Organizer: 'From Bryan to Stalin,' by William Z. Foster. International Publishers. $3.00,\\" Brooklyn Daily Eagle, April 4, 1937, pg. 48. The first part of the tale, Barbash indicates, related to Foster's early acceptance of the strategy of dual unionism ‚Äî the establishment of radical rival unions to already-existing unions with a conservative, business-friendly orientation ‚Äî and his growing realization of the \\"dangerous character\\" of such a plan and embrace of the alternative tactic of \\"boring from within\\" conservative unions to radicalize them. After joining the Communist movement, Foster's emphasis becomes one of detailing the \\"boring from within\\" process as practiced by the Trade Union Educational League which he headed, Barbash notes. Barbash is critical of the way that Foster failed to acknowledge the success of Samuel Gompers in establishing trade unions capable of withstanding the pressures of economic depression and his tendency to vilify his opponents as practitioners of \\"deliberate deception,\\" calling them \\"ultra-reactionary, misleaders, and betrayers.\\" He also upbraids Foster for an inability or unwillingness to admit error in explaining various tactical reversals of the Communists, which were transformed from support of third party Presidential politics in 1924 to a strategy of \\"defeating Landon at all costs\\" in the election of 1936. Barbash lauds Foster's account of the history of American syndicalism in the years before World War I but charges him with proffering an \\"essentially unreliable\\" treatment of the labor movement in the post-war years. Critical reaction Foster's memoir was seen by the Communist Party as a tool connecting the history of the early 20th Century American trade union movement to the history of the party itself. This relationship was emphasized by CPUSA leader Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, who in her review of From Bryan to Stalin in The New Masses hailed Foster's work the \\"broad, factual, and impersonal story\\" of \\"an American worker and the forces which led him to revolutionary conclusions and finally to the Communist Party.\\"Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, \\"Review and Comment: Bill Foster's Life Story,\\" The New Masses,\\" April 6, 1937, pg. 22. The conservative British magazine The Spectator was more sanguine in its appraisal, criticizing Foster's \\"account of the transformation of the too exotic, too doctrinaire party of zealots into the present officially truly American party that has Moscow's blessing is too brief to be more than a whet to the appetite\\" while noting that \\"a great deal of his book...will be unintelligible to the reader who has not the general outlines of recent American labour history clearly in his head.\\"From Bryan to Stalin, by William Z. Foster,\\" The Spectator, July 22, 1937, pg. 32. While Foster \\"could have written an autobiography of great interest and real value,\\" the unsigned reviewer asserted that instead Foster was \\"content to intermingle scraps of his own story with an account of the American labour movement beginning with the great upheavals of the 'nineties and passing through the heyday of the Industrial Workers of the World to the rise of orthodox communism,\\" intimating that such a decision was less than satisfactory. Foster himself regarded From Bryan to Stalin and its successor volume, Pages from a Worker's Life, as an exercise in Communist Party history writing, both as a \\"contribution to the history of left wing trade unionism in the United States during the past forty years\\" and as a semi-official history of the origins of the party itself.William Z. Foster, Pages from a Worker's Life. New York: International Publishers, 1939; pg. 11. Quoted in James R. Barrett, William Z. Foster and the Tragedy of American Radicalism. Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1999; pg. 202. In the estimation of historian and Foster biographer James R. Barrett, the books remained as such until Foster's publication of a formal History of the Communist Party of the United States of America in 1952, which effectively superseded the earlier autobiographical effort.James R.

The complementary concept in this regard is endotype, which refers to the pathogenesis of the disease ignoring its presentation. In this context, a phenotype would be any observable characteristic or trait of a disease, such as morphology, development, biochemical or physiological properties, or behavior, without any implication of a mechanism. A clinical phenotype would be the presentation of a disease in a given individual. Some organizations have their own specialised meaning. For example, the term 'phenotype' in the field of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) means \\"a single or combination of disease attributes that describe differences between individuals with COPD as they relate to clinically meaningful outcomes\\", but nearly all specialities use this meaning in some way, like in asthma research.

He attended Yale Law School for two years, until June, 1829, when he was admitted to the Connecticut bar. He then began the practice of his profession in Norwalk, where he remained until December, 1843, when he removed to New York City. During his residence in Connecticut, he was once (1838) a member of the Connecticut General Assembly, and for several years clerk of the county courts. He was also for a part of the time proprietor and editor of the Norwalk Gazette. On removing to New York he relinquished his profession, and was for some years engaged in a lucrative mercantile business; later, he was entrusted with the management of a railroad, and thence drifted into the New York Stock Exchange. In 1862 he was engaged with others in founding and organizing the North American Life Insurance Company, of which he was the first Secretary and for a long time (and at his death) the Vice President. After frequent attacks of heart-disease, he died from that cause at his home in Brooklyn, January 15, 1885, in his 78th year. In September, 1830, he was married to Hannah B. White, youngest daughter of Col. E. Moss White, of Danbury, Conn., by whom he had two sons and one daughter, who survived him. Her death in October, 1843, in connection with the failure of his health, was the occasion of the relinquishment of his profession and his removal to New York.

It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1978. History Samuel Nichols moved his family from Ohio to Iowa in the late 1830s. He built a log structure on this property that served as the family home, a post office, and occasionally as a store that catered to people who traveled between Iowa City and Muscatine. He had this house built between 1869 and 1870. He and his wife died within a year or so of its completion. The farm was passed down through the family and remained so until at least 1978 when it was nominated for the National Register of Historic Places. His son Benjamin founded the town of Nichols in 1871. It was named after Samuel who had invested heavily in the Burlington, Cedar Rapids and Northern Railroad and donated land for the depot around which the town developed. Benjamin operated a store in town before returning to farm here. His son Townsend inherited the farm from him. Architecture The Nichols House is a typical 19th-century vernacular-style farm house with a single story wing on the back. The two-story, rectangular, brick structure is five bays wide with the main entrance in the center bay. The front porch is not the original. Chimneys are set at each end of the gable roof. The deck in the center of the roof is original to the house, but the railings are replacements.

Combining an element of folk rock, similar to the sound of the Beau Brummels, with the essence of a raw garage band, the group became immensely popular in Arizona. Though the Lewallen Brothers never broke through to a national audience, the band is noted for being one of the longest- enduring garage musical acts to emerge from the 1960s, as the group performed well into the 1990s. History Formed in 1962, the group was originally known as the CoKats, and consisted of brothers Cal (bass guitar, vocals) Keith (lead guitar, vocals), Tim (rhythm guitar, vocals) and Bobby Lewallen (organ, vocals). The band soon recruited Dennis Gamble (drums), and were occasionally joined by their sister Gayle Ann (vocals) and father Cal senior (bass guitar), while boasting a repertoire that featured material from the Everly Brothers, Chuck Berry, and the Ventures. With an established presence on the teen dance club and bar circuit, the CoKats entered the studio to record four demos on November 14, 1964. From the sessions, the song \\"Tough He Was\\" was presented to record producer Bob Keane, who released the tune on the group's debut single, and convinced the CoKats to change their name to the Lewallen Brothers. By the mid-1960s, the group was opening for musical acts such as the Turtles, the Beau Brummels, and Paul Revere and the Raiders. Ironically, the hard-pressed schedule that came with the Lewallen Brothers being a live musical act consequently impeded the group from recording consistently. Music critic Bruce Eder explains \\"Their impeccable harmony singing, coupled with their considerable instrumental prowess and their tight sound, made them highly desireable [sic] both as a warm-up act as well as a backing band\\". In 1967, the band released the two singles \\"It Must Be a Dream\\" and \\"Only a Dream\\", both of which were met with regional success. After winning a battle of the bands contest in 1968, the group earned an appearances on Dick Clark's television program Happening '68, competing on three shows. However, without a nationally distributing record label to back them, the Lewallen Brothers could not capitalize on the exposure. In 1969, Gamble departed the band and was replaced by Mike Ramsey. The band returned to Tucson, becoming the house band for the Cedars music club, with the brothers also working part-time as plumbers in their family business. In 1981, the Lewallen Brothers went on a decade-long hiatus after Bobby Lewallen died from cancer. Returning in the early 1990s without Tim Lewallen, who decided to become a plumber full-time, the band occasionally performed around Arizona. The compilation album Hitch- Hike was released in December 1995, and featured all the group's recorded material. Other albums the band appears on include The Cicadelic Sixties, Volume 7 - From Texas to Tucson!, Green Crystal Ties, Volume 3: Gloria Meets 96 Tears, Green Crystal Ties, Volume 7: Mind-Expanding Punk of the 60s, The Tucson Sound 1960‚Äì1968: Think of the Good Times!, and Wyld Sydes, Volume 4.

It holds changing exhibitions, festivals, artist talks, lectures, workshops, concerts and performances. It is housed in a former tram depot at 24 Gagarina Boulevard. Yelena Petrova is its director. Perm Museum of Contemporary Art was devised by and is the legacy of its former founder, director and curator Marat Gelman. Gelman was sacked in June 2013 amid fallout over showing Vasily Slonov's exhibition Welcome! Sochi 2014 that satirised the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Before this, in 2010, the Financial Times praised PERMM as \\"one of the most spectacular galleries of modern art in Russia.\\" PERMM, Perm State Art Gallery and Perm Krai Museum are situated close to each other and form a museum complex. The museum was previously housed in the former Stalinist ferry building, known as the Perm River Station Hall on the banks of the Kama River but had to move as the building was unsafe. History Perm Museum of Contemporary Art was initially housed in the former Stalinist ferry building, known as the Perm River Station Hall. The building was built in 1940, at 2 Ordzhonikidze Street, opposite Perm-I railway station and on the banks of the Kama River. The museum had to vacate this building as it was too unsafe, requiring renovation. It moved into a nearby former tram depot at 24 Gagarina Boulevard. The museum was devised by and is the legacy of its former founder, director and curator, Moscow gallery owner Marat Gelman. Gelman was spearheading a cultural revolution in the industrial city of Perm, which had a liberal political climate compared with the \\"throwback authoritarianism\\" of elsewhere in Russia. The driving force behind the Perm culture project, as it was known, was Oleg Chirkunov, governor of the Perm region from 2004. The Museum was an important part of this transformation. Chirkunov was replaced by Viktor Basargin, \\"an ally of President Vladimir Putin\\", in 2012. In 2013 Vasily Slonov's Welcome! Sochi 2014 was to be exhibited as part of the White Nights city-wide arts festival organised by Gelman. The show gathered artworks deemed by Russian censors to ridicule the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, and Stalin. The authorities shut down the show shortly after its launch but Gelman moved it to PERMM. The authorities concluded that the works were extremist, and sacked Gelman. Gelman was replaced by Elena Oleynikova, who was also dismissed within weeks \\"for agreeing to host a forum with civil society organisation Pilorama on the grounds of the museum\\". Yelena Petrova has been its director since December 2013.

Construction  Fuso Maru was laid down in 1907 at the Barcay Curle Co. Ltd. shipyard in Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom. She was launched on 19 March 1908 and was completed in February 1909. She was built for the Russian East Asiatic Steamship Company and was named Russia. She was renamed Fuso Maru when she was bought by the Japanese company Osaka Shosen K. K. - OSK Line on 24 December 1923. Fuso Maru was long, with a beam of and a depth of . The ship was assessed at . She had two triple expansion steam engines rated at 7,113 ihp (5,304 kilowatts) and driving two screws. She had two funnels and four masts.  Pre-World War II career  As Russia, the ship completed her maiden voyage from Libau, Russia, to New York City, United States, on 2 June 1909, and her last voyage on 26 June 1914. She was then laid up at Kronstadt, Russia, until 1917, when she was renamed Rossija and later Russ. In 1921 she was transferred to the Baltic American Line and renamed Latvia. She started service on the Libau‚ÄìDanzig‚ÄìHalifax‚ÄìNew York City route on 11 July 1921. Her ninth and last transatlantic voyage started on 7 February 1923. She then was sold to Osaka Shosen Kaisha of Japan on 24 December 1923 and renamed Fuso Maru. Two of her masts were removed at this time. Fuso Maru then served two different companies under four different names before finally being purchased by the Japanese Company Osaka Shosen K. K. - OSK Line. Fuso Maru operated on the Kobe, Japan‚ÄìKirun, Taiwan route from 18 July 1924 until March 1934. She then provided service on the Kobe‚ÄìDairen, Manchukuo, route from March 1934 until November 1941. She had accommodation for 42 first-class, 56 second-class, 212 third-class, and 1,414 fourth-class passengers, and had a crew of 144.  World War II career  In November 1941, the Imperial Japanese Army charted Fuso Maru for use as a troopship. She was most likely painted grey overall and armed with a suite of antiaircraft guns at this time. Fuso Maru participated as a troopship in Operation \\"E\\", the Japanese invasion of Malaya beginning on 13 December 1941. In late December 1941, she was rerated as a hospital ship. She was most likely disarmed because of the international prohibition against hospital ships carrying armament, and she was painted white with a green horizontal strip and red crosses on her sides and funnel. Shortly after sunrise on 15 April 1943, Allied aircraft attacked Fuso Maru three times near the Shortland Islands near (). Fuso Maru returned to service as a troopship later in 1943 and was repainted overall grey and again armed with antiaircraft guns.  Sinking  On 31 July 1944 Fuso Maru was part of Convoy MI-11, which consisted of 23 ships, including the tankers Koei Maru, Taketoyo Maru, Shichiyo Maru, Ayagumo Maru, Harima Maru, and Ogura Maru No. 1 and the cargo ships and troopships Fuso Maru, Ayayuki Maru, Yoshino Maru, Miho Maru, Enoshima Maru, Manko Maru, Hachijin Maru, Dakar Maru, Teiritsu Maru, Fukuju Maru, and Banshu Maru No. 16, escorted by the destroyer Shiokaze, the escort ship Shimushu, the minesweepers W-38 and W-39, the submarine chaser CH-55, and the auxiliary gunboat Kazan Maru. The convoy was attacked in the South China Sea northwest of Cape Mayraira, Luzon, while it was proceeding from Moji, Japan to Miri, Borneo, by a United States Navy submarine wolfpack patrolling the Luzon Strait under the command of Captain (later Rear Admiral) Lewis S. Parks. The wolfpack consisted of Lieutenant Commander (later Vice Admiral) Lawson P. Ramage‚Ä≤s , Lieutenant Commander (later Captain) David L. Whelchel's , and Lieutenant Commander John C. Martin's . At 3:32 AM, Parche torpedoed and sank Koei Maru with four torpedoes. Although she was carrying a unit of 1,050 Imperial Japanese Army troops, the casualties aboard her were relatively light; about 150 troops and nine crewmen were killed. About the same time, tanker Ogura Maru No. 1 was hit by two torpedoes, killing five men, but she did not sink. At 3:40 AM, Parche torpedoed and sank Yoshino Maru with four torpedoes; she carried down 2,442 of the 5,063 Imperial Japanese Army troops she was carrying, as well as 18 gunners, 35 crewmen, and 400 cubic meters (14,120 cubic feet) of ammunition. At 4:20 AM, Steelhead hit Dakar Maru with two torpedoes, killing six men, but Dakar Maru did not sink and quickly beached herself. Aboard Fuso Maru, 40 men were assigned to duty as lookouts, including Imperial Japanese Army artillerymen and infantrymen. At 4:55 AM, one lookout spotted a torpedo approaching the ship and her captain ordered her rudder turned hard to port, but it was too late. Steelheads torpedo hit Fuso Maru‚Ä≤s engine room on the port side of the ship. Fuso Maru bucked and trembled from the explosion and the blast blew upwards, destroying several lifeboats that were on deck. Fuso Maru took on a 25-degree list to port in heavy seas when the order to abandon ship was issued. The ground vehicles carried as deck cargo broke loose and fell onto men swimming in the water. At 5:10 AM, Fuso Maru sank only 15 minutes after the torpedo hit, taking down 1,316 of 4,500 troops aboard. Seventy men of the 2nd Company, Sixth Aviation Signal Regiment, 12 other passengers, and 22 crew members also perished, bringing the death toll to 1,384 people. A cargo consisting of food and medical supplies, oil, trucks, 36 railway carriages, and 1,120-tons of other military supplies also was lost. At 5:14 AM, Parche torpedoed and sank Manko Maru. She carried several hundred Imperial Japanese Navy personnel, 17 crewmen, about 20 gunners, and a cargo of ammunition down with her. Altogether, four of the 23 ships of Convoy MI-11 sank and two were damaged. The ships took down several thousand military personnel, gunners, and crewmen, as well as their cargoes of ammunition and other supplies.

What it Seemed to Be\\" is a song composed by Bennie Benjamin, George Weiss and Frankie Carle. The song was most popular in 1946, and was taken to number 1 that year by both Frank Sinatra and the Frankie Carle orchestra, the latter with Marjorie Hughes on vocals. Composition The song was first published in 1945 by Abilene Music, Inc. and Anne-Rachel Music Corp. The song helped make Benjamin and Weiss the top songwriters of 1946. Largely on the strength of this composition, other Carle compositions received attention as well. Between Carle and Sinatra, the song spent 35% of the year 1946 at the top of Billboard's charts. It also spent nineteen weeks on Your Hit Parade, eight of them in the top position. As sheet music, the song was the fourth most popular of 1946. The song's subject matter deals with routine occurrences that become momentous when a significant other is involved. Frankie Carle version Carle's version was the most popular, staying on the chart for twenty weeks, and topping the chart for eleven of those. It was the 22nd most popular recording of the pre-rock era. It introduced Marjorie Hughes as vocalist. Carle was reluctant to acknowledge that his vocalist was his daughter, fearing that charges of nepotism would hurt her career if she were not proven to be an effective vocalist in her own right. However, the outstanding success of this song soon caused an announcement that Carle and Hughes were indeed closely related. Frank Sinatra versions Sinatra's first version of the song was with Axel Stordahl orchestration. Sinatra had told the arranger to not modify it from the version presented by the composers. Although initially more popular than Carle's own version, Sinatra's recording was ultimately only slightly less popular than Carle's, with a chart run of seventeen weeks, eight of those at the number one position. Sinatra re-recorded the song with Nelson Riddle orchestration for the 1963 album Sinatra's Sinatra. The version was less well received, as by this time Sinatra had long moved beyond any babe-in- the-woods persona. Earlier, Sinatra had performed a version for the Old Gold radio show. A rehearsal take for that show in which Sinatra clowns around by voicing it in the manner of Mickey Katz has found popularity with collectors. Other recorded versions Other popular 1946 versions were a duet by Helen Forrest and Dick Haymes (charting at number 4), and Charlie Spivak (number 5). The George Paxton band also released a version in 1946. For MGM, The DeMarco Sisters recorded it in 1954. The Castells had a minor hit (number 92) with the song in August 1962. Willie Nelson covered the song in 1994's album Healing Hands of Time. References Frank Sinatra songs 1945 songs ","title":"Oh!

The abbot's residence, first built in the early 16th century and repaired in the 17th and 18th centuries, is now a listed building that is currently in use as a farmhouse.

The abbey church was consecrated in 1267. At this period it was a monastery for Cistercian nuns. In 1413 the community of nuns was disbanded, and by 1461 the Cistercian Order had redesignated the property as a monastery for monks. The house was briefly evacuated in 1480-1483 due to an outbreak of plague. In November 1568, early in the Dutch Revolt, the abbey and its church were set on fire by rebel forces. The community fled and the abbot, Cornelis Lievens, died in Leuven in 1569. Rebuilding began in 1589, and the church was reconsecrated in 1617 by Jean Dauvin, bishop of Namur. The monastery was on the front lines of the War of the Spanish Succession, just a few miles from Ramillies, and suffered depredations and damage accordingly. Fresh rebuilding work was completed in 1711. After the French invasion of the Southern Netherlands, the revolutionaries suppressed Boneffe Abbey along with all other religious houses.

The battalion has participated in World War I, World War II, Operation Desert Storm, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation Iraqi Freedom. History=World War I The 3-320th FAR's beginnings can be traced back to America's entry into World War I. As part of U.S. mobilization, 3-320th was constituted, organized and activated in August 1917 as Battery C, 320th Field Artillery (C/320th FA). As part of the original 82nd Division, C/320th FA played a key role at Lorraine, St. Mihiel, and the Meuse Argonne region in France. Following the Armistice, the 320th FA demobilized, only to be reconstituted in June 1921 as part of the United States Organized Reserves. World War II In August 1942, when the 82nd Infantry Division was converted to an airborne division, the 320th FA (including C/320th) was reorganized and redesignated as the 320th Glider Field Artillery Battalion (GFAB). As part of the 82nd Airborne Division, the 320th GFAB fought in a number of hot spots. First, the 320th GFAB was part of the campaign in Sicily, acting in reserve. The unit first saw action at the Volturno River on the Italian mainland. The crucial Normandy invasion was the next stop for the 320th GFAB. Under difficult conditions, the unit helped make the invasion a success. As a result of the 320th's actions during Operation Overlord, the unit was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation and two French Croix de Guerre. The 320th GFAB next fought in Operation Market Garden and then the Battle of the Bulge when the Germans attempted their last-ditch offensive. The 320th GFAB then fought and played a role in the final push through the Rhineland to defeat Germany. Upon the war's end the unit completed its duties in Europe as part of the post-war occupation in Berlin. Early Cold War After the war, the 320th GFAB went through a number of transitions. It was inactivated on 15 December 1948 and relieved from assignment to the 82nd Airborne Division on 14 December 1950. On 1 August 1951 it was reorganized and redesignated as the 320th Airborne Field Artillery Battalion (AFAB), and activated at Fort Benning, Georgia with the 508th Airborne Regimental Combat Team (ARCT). The battalion served with the 508th ARCT at Fort Benning, Georgia, from 1951-1953, then moved to Fort Campbell, Kentucky, and became part of the 11th Airborne Division. In June‚ÄìJuly 1955, the battalion moved with the 508th to Japan, replacing the 187th ARCT's 674th Airborne Field Artillery Battalion. When the Army eliminated infantry regiments and battalions from division and organized under the Pentomic structure, the 320th Field Artillery was reorganized as a parent regiment under the Combat Arms Regimental System. C/320th FA was initially assigned to the 11th Airborne Division in Germany on 1 March 1957, and inactivated on 1 July 1958 when the 11th Airborne was replaced by the 24th Infantry Division. The battery was reactivated on 1 July 1960, and served at Fort Bragg with the 82nd Airborne Division. As part of the restructuring to the Reorganization Objective Army Division, the battery was inactivated 25 May 1964. C/320th FA were redesignated on 3 July 1968 as Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 3rd Battalion, 320th Artillery (3-320th Arty), and assigned once again to the 82nd Airborne Division. The battalion was activated to replace the 2-321st FA, which had deployed to Vietnam, in the strategic reserve. 3-320th again inactivated when the 2-321st returned from Vietnam in 1969. Late Cold War As part of the transition to the U.S. Army Regimental System in 1986, the 3-320th was activated in the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, by reflagging the 3-319th. Gulf War 3-320 FAR next saw action in the Middle East from 1990 until 1991. As a part of the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), the battalion was part of the massive US force that drove the Iraqi Army from Kuwait. The 3-320 FAR was commanded during Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm by LTC Thomas J. Costello.

A large Spanish force attacked the castle town of Marv√£o but was repelled and defeated by an Anglo Portuguese force under the command of Captain Thomas Browne.Baule p 85 (Portuguese) Events=Background Two Spanish offensives which aimed to overrun Portugal had failed during the summer of 1762.Nester p.218 Around the same time Spain received the support of France with 10,000 troops and equipment while Britain had sent reinforcements to aid the Portuguese; in total around 8,000 men led by John Burgoyne and General George Townshend.Jaques p 37 The third invasion of Portuguese territory was stimulated by the peace negotiations between France and Great Britain. Spain's position and bargaining power during the peace talks would be reinforced with a surprise attack in late autumn (campaigns were held off until Spring normally at this time).Speelman, Patrick & Danley, Mark (2012), The Seven Years' War: Global Views pp. 447-48 However, the commander in Portugal, Count Lippe, had already reinforced the most important garrisons with British troops and officers and first line Portuguese troops. The Spanish split their army in several corps, with each one attacking a specific target. Marv√£o was one, which the Spanish hoped to seize and hold. Battle Marv√£o's Castelo which sat on a granite crag of the Serra de S√£o Mamede near the Tagus on the frontier was an important dominant feature which was key to take in order to make the Spanish crossing of the Tagus easier. The castle itself was defended by 500 men under Captain Thomas Browne who was in charge of a company of Colonel Bigoe Armstrong's 83rd Regiment of foot with a small detachment of Portuguese troops, militia and a number of cannon. As the Spanish corps strength of 4000 to 5000 men approached the area, the terrorized population pressed for surrender, but the firmness of Captain Brown prevailed who was at first expecting a long siege. He was surprised when the Spanish attacked giving the nature of the fortifications high defensive position. The Spanish attempted to move up via the easy approach of the South East side of Marv√£o, Brown then sent reinforcements from the main citadel to that side. The British and Portuguese opened fire with musket and cannon against the Spanish assailants who tried to throw themselves up against the walls. (Portuguese) To compound problems many of the Spanish scaling ladders were too short to mount the walls, and they were easily repelled with heavy losses; the Spanish lost many men to accidents as well as cannon and musket fire. The Spanish commander realizing surprise was lost and the castle being well defended called off the attack; he was not prepared for a siege and retreated the next day. Aftermath The other Spanish advance was halted at Ouguela (another small fort) but there the Portuguese garrison was equally prepared. The Spanish were driven before the place with considerable losses and obliged to abandon the attempt. On 19 November both garrisons retaliated, joined forces and raided and held the Spanish town of La Codosera. The resistance which the Spaniards met with in these small places had a visible effect upon their movements and convinced them that any attempt upon the Alentejo would require a decisive victory. The lateness of the season in some measure contributed to this and disease was taking a huge toll as well as the lack of supplies. On 15 November the whole of the Spanish force retreated and on 22 November Spain asked for a truce.

Local tradition recalls the use of the rock shelter as a refuge during the time of Ngoni raiding in the 19th century. The site is known for various rock paintings as well as advanced microlithic use. History of research The Kalemba rockshelter is an archaeological site located in eastern Zambia, discovered in 1955 by R. A. Hamilton and then reported to the former Rhodes-Livingstone Museum. But it wasn‚Äôt until 1971 that the site was excavated by D.W. Phillipson. Over 30 meters in height, the rock shelter is formed by an outcrop of granite gneiss. Facing the Chipwete valley, on the north-west side the rockshelter has a height of 4.5 meters, maximum, and extends through an open area for protection. The flat surface is located near the north-east side of the rockshelter; closed off on all sides, it has a steep rocky headland on the main hillside. The north and south-west of the rockshelter provide an extension of floor living space as well as a decent vantage point that overlooks the upper Chipwete valley. A second, smaller, less protected shelter has a floor of and adjoins, at the southwest end of the main shelter. Entrance from the north end of the main shelter or from the hills at the southern corner allows for easy access to both rock shelters. Paintings are located at both shelters; with a distance of 12 meters located at the rear wall of the main shelter and under the south western overhang lies a smaller panel. Excavation Originally, the excavation at Kalemba was restricted to a grid of 10 squares, however, an extension was needed in order to avoid collapse around the side walls. The excavation was divided into two parts due to a fallen boulder that lies equidistant to the wall of the main shelter. A total of thirteen separate soil horizons were identified. In order for Philipson and members part of the excavation to gain access to the lower levels, they had to add an additional extension to the excavation to the north-west. Ultimately, the excavation had covered a total area of . Charcoal was collected for radiocarbon dating as well as soil samples for pedagogical analysis. However, after some time the excavation had to be deserted at a depth of due to unsafe condition with the side walls. To further the excavation, it was necessary to remove boulders weighing about 25 tonnes with the use of a block and tackle. It is assumed that the richest deposits are located underneath those boulders. Unfortunately, the resources necessary to deal safely and successfully with the situation of the boulders were not available to D.W. Philipson in 1971, therefore, the excavation had to come to a halt. Stratigraphy and dating Radiocarbon dates suggest that human occupation covered about 37,000 years at Kalemba. If the hypothesis that dates GX-2767 and GX-2768 are better represented by the dating to around 13,000 years BCE, then according to Phillipson,Phillipson the remaining dates are consistent and form a series that suggests several periods of occupation that follow: period 1, before 35,000 years BCE; period 2, c. 25,000 to 21,000 years BCE; Period 3, c. 15,000 to 11,000 years BCE, and period 4 < 6,000 years BCE. Finds * Flakes * Stone * Hammer stones, anvils, rubbing and grinding stone * Bone artifacts * Shell artifacts * Pottery * Metal objects * Burials * Remains of pole and bamboo-framed shelters Flakes The flakes are based on 1243 whole flakes with random samples taken from roughly 100 specimens. To name a few of the flakes discovered, there are curved back geometric which represent roughly 30 percent of the retouched implements found. Pointed lunates were also discovered which represent an even larger portion of curved backed geometric category, 59 percent to be exact, none of the pointed lunates bear an eared projection at the tip, however, in the more recent periods, the tip on one is more emphasized. Another type of flake discovered was the deep lunate with a mean length of and only thirty three of these specimens being collected. Only seventeen of asymmetrical lunate was collected having a mean length of . A couple of microliths were discovered, twenty seven trapezoidal microlith with a mean of and fourteen triangular microliths with a mean length of . Ground stone artefacts Eleven axes, two pestles, four stones and one linguate object were collected according to Phillipson. The linguate object as well as the stone were the only ones of that type to be found in Eastern Zambia in archaeological context. Hammerstones. anvils, rubbing and grinding stones About thirty seven knapping hammers were collected, thirty two of them were unbroken and weigh anywhere from a piece. Out of all the knapping stones only one was quartz and a preferred type of hammer‚Äîpieces of flattened ovoid shape were apparent in the discovery. Twelve pounding stones were collected, with maximum dimensions of and a mean of . Four anvils were collected, three being quartz and one on chert cobble. Seven rubbing stones were collected and only one grinding stone. However, the grinding stone was thick and was grounded to a depth of twelve mm. The last use for the grinding stone was for a red pigment. Bone artifacts Three headed pins were collected and discovered to be produced from the long bones of a large bird. Eight straight bodkins and two curved bodkins were found which vary from oval to circular. One of the curved bodkins seem to be a small sharpened rib while the other being a completely worked indeterminate bone. Two complete conical points were collected and in length; indicate origins of splinter bone. A needle was also collected, however, it is assumed that it isn‚Äôt entirely natural. Finally, one carved bone tool was discovered originating from a bird's long bone being in diameter. Shell artifacts Fourteen disc beads, one pendant and one disc were collected at Kalemba. Four of the beads were made from achatina shell, one was made from water snail shell, and the remaining nine were made from an indeterminable land snail. The shell disc, was a broken half of a water snail shell. And the shell pendant was also made from water snail shell, but it is assumed it was lost or discarded before it was actually completed. Pottery Only three complete vessels were collected, but remains of 392 potsherds were also discovered. 100 of the sherds were decorated at the rim, but the remaining 292 were undecorated body sherds. Metal objects Four pieces of worked iron metal were found. A ring and wire were present. The ring being in diameter with a rectangular band . The wire was in length and a diameter of maximum.

Architecture The Warde House is a fine example of residential Greek Revival architecture in Iowa. It is primarily constructed in brick with decorative elements executed in limestone, wood, and metal. It measures and features five bays on the front and four bays along each side. The bays are divided by pilasters that support a full entablature encircling the house.

History SonicEnergy was founded in 2011 by Meredith Perry while she was a student at the University of Pennsylvania for the school's invention competition, deemed \\"PennVention\\". SonicEnergy won PennVention in April 2011 and demonstrated the first prototype of the technology at The Wall Street Journal's All Things Digital Conference, D9 in May 2011. SonicEnergy has received $26 million in investment from venture capitalists and investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Upfront Ventures, Founders Fund as well as billionaire Mark Cuban and former Yahoo! Inc. Chief Executive Marissa Mayer. Axios reported that SonicEnergy privately demonstrated a working prototype of the technology at the Upfront Summit on February 2, 2017. SonicEnergy publicly demonstrated wirelessly charging several iPhone 7s, Samsung Galaxy S7's, and LEDs simultaneously to USA Today, which was published on the front page of the newspaper on June 1, 2017. By 2016, all of SonicEnergy's original engineering team had left the company, with some engineers leaving before their stocks had vested.https://www.businessinsider.com/ubeam-former-engineers-doubt-it-can- work-2016-5 Also in 2016, the former VP of Engineering Paul Reynolds wrote a series of blog posts stating that SonicEnergy's technology did not work.https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/20/ubeam/https://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/12/ex- employee-claims-wireless-charging-start-up-ubeam-is-a-sham.html In September 2018, Meredith Perry stepped down from her role as CEO as the company changed to a business-to-business model, and was replaced by Jacqueline McCauley. In January 2019, McCauley was replaced by Simon McElrea as CEO and then in December of the same year Will Kain replaced McElrea as acting CEO. In the same announcement, the name of the company was changed from uBeam to SonicEnergy. Technology In November 2015, the company released technical specifications for its proposed system. SonicEnergy's system would transmit ultrasound at frequencies between 45 kHz - 75 kHz, with a sound intensity of 145 dB to 155 dB SPL, and it would use a phased array technique to direct the beam. Criticisms Some observers have been critical of the company's ultrasound technology, stating that SonicEnergy's claims are unlikely to be achievable. Critics have also cited problems such as the difficulty of achieving high efficiency in sound transfer, of achieving an unobstructed path for the beam, and the high absorption of high frequency ultrasound in air. The Australian electrical engineer Dave Jones has been a frequent critic of SonicEnergy, stating it \\"will NEVER be a practical solution\\",https://www.eevblog.com/2017/06/23/eevblog-1001-ubeam-ultrasonic- wireless-charging-debunked/ and has offered detailed explanations on why \\"it will never work\\"https://www.eevblog.com/2019/06/26/eevblog-1224-ubeam-is- sinking Dr. Daniel Rogers, Professor at New York University published a paper, including calculations, stating \\"IT'S AN IMPOSSIBLE IDEA\\", and further stating: \\"crazy ideas that are physically impossible are raising huge sums and getting tons of traction on nothing but dishonest PR\\".https://lookatmeimdanny.tumblr.com/post/101432017159/how-putting-10m-into- ubeam-illustrates-everything  Ultrasound Safety  Ultrasound has less potential to damage tissue than ionising radiation; however ultrasound energy has the potential to produce biological effects on the body. Ultrasound waves can heat the tissues slightly. In some cases, it can also produce small pockets of gas in body fluids or tissues (cavitation). The dose response relation between occupational exposure to very high frequency noise and resultant hearing risk is unknown. The company claims that the beam will cut out automatically if it is intercepted by objects other than the receiver.

The fort was built by the British as part of a buffer against Spanish Florida and the colonies to the north. The fort was abandoned and later destroyed by the Spanish in mid-1742.  Background  In 1732, General James Oglethorpe led the colonization of Georgia for Great Britain and chose Savannah as the principal port for the colony. The establishment of the colony had been an issue of contention between Britain and Spain since its foundation. The Spanish claimed the territory for its own colony of Florida and disputed what it regarded as an illegal occupation by the British settlers. The building of Fort Frederica on St. Simons Island (near the mouth of the Altamaha River) in 1736 marked the beginning of General Oglethorpe's defensive plan for Georgia. His thinking was influenced heavily by Georgia's maritime geography, which was primarily an uninterrupted series of coastal barrier islands that formed a natural water route, known as the inland passage, offering protection from unpredictable weather and the harsh conditions of the open sea.  History  Fort St. Andrews was built in 1736 on the northern end of Cumberland Island, at what is now known as Terrapin Point, facing the inland passage. It was built in a star work configuration, in the form of a four-pointed star. The star design helps prevent a dead zone in the fort's defense. The fort was about by . A palisade triangular water battery, which was designed to attack incoming ships at the waterline, was located at the base of the hill; it was connected to the main fort by a covered passage. A second battery was located on the western side of the island to protect the approach through the inland waterway. Troops were quartered in a nearby village of huts named Barrimacke. Of the regiment of 700 soldiers sent to the colony in 1738, Oglethorpe posted 200 men at Fort St. Andrews and a smaller company (perhaps 50 or 60 men) on the southern end of Cumberland Island. The main purpose was to protect Darien and Frederica to the north. In 1738 a newly arrived British regiment attempted to mutiny. This was set off by the primitive living conditions and the failure to pay the extra remuneration normally given for a sea voyage. General Oglethorpe led the officers in regaining control. When the War of Jenkins' Ear broke out in 1739, Spain began drawing up plans for an invasion. Spanish governor Don Manuel de Montiano commanded the invasion force and invaded Georgia in 1742. Separated from the main Spanish invasion fleet, about 15 ships were located at Cumberland Island and were sheltered off the coast near the fort in St. Andrew Sound in June 1742. General Oglethorpe ordered the fort abandoned and a retreat south to Fort William. In July, when the Spanish forces retreated after the Battle of Bloody Marsh, they camped at the abandoned fort on their return trip to Florida and burned it down. Afterward, a company of British rangers was stationed at the ruins of the fort for several years, but it was never rebuilt.

Salamon (born June 23, 1963) is an American multi-disciplinary artist who paints portraits in oils, depictions of human drama, and paintings of everyday objects. Salamon is also a sculptor, short filmmaker, curator and musician.  Early life  Salamon was born in Los Angeles, California to a creative family. His father Joseph enjoyed painting, and his mother Mary Lou loved to write and play piano. His family moved to Newport Beach, CA when he was two. Salamon learned how to play the drums at 13; and he began performing in local nightclubs, schools and churches at 16 with different bands. When he was 18, he created the drawings for the album cover of his band, Idle Lovell, which was then signed to Blonde Vinyl Records. Salamon eventually performed in over a dozen rock and roll Bands, including Homes of Bones, in which he wrote original music, played guitar, and sang lead vocals.  Art career  When his artistic talent became apparent, Salamon‚Äôs father began publishing Gavin Edwards, \\"Technical Knockout\\", Details Magazine 10/1994 charcoal drawings that Salamon was creating of celebrities and cultural icons.Rebecca Schoenkopf, \\"Too Much Success/Bradford Wants to Grow Up\\", OC Weekly 11/1997 Within a few years, over 100 works were published and distributed to nationwide retailers such as Virgin Megastores and Tower Records. In 1993, at the age of 30, Salamon's fascination with celebrities was waning, and he returned to school. In his mid-thirties, after graduating with a degree in art, and studying abroad, his journey led him back to portraiture. He began painting in oil, and was highly influenced by Lucian Freud and Alice Neel. From 1996 to 1999, Salamon was chosen as an official Grammy artist by The National Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2003, Salamon's solo show at Square Blue Gallery in Newport Beach, CA called \\"Orange County Tastemakers\\" was reviewed by many publications including ArtScene,Daniella Walsh, Art Scene , 6/2003 Orange County RegisterRichard Chang, \\"Portraits of O.C. Artistry\\", Orange County Register, 5/2003 and Riviera Magazine. The publication which accompanied the show called \\"Orange County Tastemakers\\" included essays by museum curators and prominent gallerists. In 2011, Salamon focused on an old toy car left in his studio by one of his daughters. Using a new painting technique, he realized it was not just a still life that he had painted, but an actual portrait of an object. Pleased with the results, he began a new series of vintage object paintings that were exhibited in several West Coast galleries.Liz Goldner, \\"UNDER the Influence \\", ArtScene, July/August, 2014\\"Unlikely Portraits\\", American Art Collector, November 2014Southwest Art Magazine, June 2015\\"Function and Design\\", American Art Collector, June 2015 Meanwhile, his interest in portraiture continued unabated. After Bradford‚Äôs move to Los Angeles in 2009, he began painting many LA area artists, curators, and gallerists such as Don Bachardy, Andy Moses, Llyn Foulkes and Roland Reiss.Roberta Carasso, \\"The Body and Soul of Art\\", Coast Magazine 05/2010 A solo show of these portraits was held at 2016 at Launch Gallery in Los Angeles. From 2006 - 2016, Salamon was an adjunct professor at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa, CA and Coastline Community College in Newport Beach, CA, teaching painting from life, as well as conducting private workshops in his Los Angeles studio. In 2011, Salamon began directing and producing short films about art, artists, gallerists, and critics. Each cinematic work is a record of how and where each artist works, his or her philosophy, and their own contributions to art. In 2017, he began painting a series of everyday objects. These objects range from cheeseburgers to sunflower seeds, and place settings to rolls of toilet paper. https://ocweekly.com/bradford-j-salamons- paintings-turn-cultural-detritus-into-destination- artwork-8575523/https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/59526d8be4b0f078efd984e0 About this time, Salamon began a series of sculptures using various mediums including concrete, liquid nails and other industrial materials. In 2016, he curated a show called \\"Future Recollection\\" at Jamie Brooks Fine Art in Costa Mesa, CA. Artists in the show included Don Bachardy, Rebecca Campbell, Ray Turner (artist), and William Wray. In January of 2019, Salamon curated a show entitled \\"Kitsch-In-Sync: Art and Its Opposite\\" at Coastline College Art Gallery in Newport Beach, CA. This show featured 47 artists, including Mark Ryden, Mark Kostabi and Kim Abeles. https://issuu.com/smarkkauf/docs/localarts_winter2019 In 2013, he had his first solo museum show, at the Lancaster Museum of Art, featuring his vintage object paintings.Roberta Carasso, \\"Objectified at the Museum of Art & History\\", art ltd.

It involves the development and application of mathematical, statistical and data-analytical methods for modelling and simulation of biological structures. The field is broadly defined and includes foundations in anatomy, applied mathematics and pure mathematics, machine learning, computational mechanics, computational science, biological imaging, neuroscience, physics, probability, and statistics; it also has strong connections with fluid mechanics and geometric mechanics. Additionally, it complements newer, interdisciplinary fields like bioinformatics and neuroinformatics in the sense that its interpretation uses metadata derived from the original sensor imaging modalities (of which Magnetic Resonance Imaging is one example). It focuses on the anatomical structures being imaged, rather than the medical imaging devices. It is similar in spirit to the history of Computational linguistics, a discipline that focuses on the linguistic structures rather than the sensor acting as the transmission and communication media. In computational anatomy, the diffeomorphism group is used to study different coordinate systems via coordinate transformations as generated via the Lagrangian and Eulerian velocities of flow in {\\\\mathbb R}^3. The flows between coordinates in computational anatomy are constrained to be geodesic flows satisfying the principle of least action for the Kinetic energy of the flow. The kinetic energy is defined through a Sobolev smoothness norm with strictly more than two generalized, square-integrable derivatives for each component of the flow velocity, which guarantees that the flows in \\\\mathbb{R}^3 are diffeomorphisms. It also implies that the diffeomorphic shape momentum taken pointwise satisfying the Euler-Lagrange equation for geodesics is determined by its neighbors through spatial derivatives on the velocity field. This separates the discipline from the case of incompressible fluids for which momentum is a pointwise function of velocity. Computational anatomy intersects the study of Riemannian manifolds and nonlinear global analysis, where groups of diffeomorphisms are the central focus. Emerging high-dimensional theories of shape are central to many studies in computational anatomy, as are questions emerging from the fledgling field of shape statistics. The metric structures in computational anatomy are related in spirit to morphometrics, with the distinction that Computational anatomy focuses on an infinite-dimensional space of coordinate systems transformed by a diffeomorphism, hence the central use of the terminology diffeomorphometry, the metric space study of coordinate systems via diffeomorphisms. Genesis At computational anatomy's heart is the comparison of shape by recognizing in one shape the other. This connects it to D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson's developments On Growth and Form which has led to scientific explanations of morphogenesis, the process by which patterns are formed in Biology. Albrecht Durer's Four Books on Human Proportion were arguably the earliest works on computational anatomy. The efforts of Noam Chomsky in his pioneering of Computational Linguistics inspired the original formulation of computational anatomy as a generative model of shape and form from exemplars acted upon via transformations. Due to the availability of dense 3D measurements via technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computational anatomy has emerged as a subfield of medical imaging and bioengineering for extracting anatomical coordinate systems at the morphome scale in 3D. The spirit of this discipline shares strong overlap with areas such as computer vision and kinematics of rigid bodies, where objects are studied by analysing the groups responsible for the movement in question. Computational anatomy departs from computer vision with its focus on rigid motions, as the infinite-dimensional diffeomorphism group is central to the analysis of Biological shapes. It is a branch of the image analysis and pattern theory school at Brown University pioneered by Ulf Grenander. In Grenander's general Metric Pattern Theory, making spaces of patterns into a metric space is one of the fundamental operations since being able to cluster and recognize anatomical configurations often requires a metric of close and far between shapes. The diffeomorphometry metric of Computational anatomy measures how far two diffeomorphic changes of coordinates are from each other, which in turn induces a metric on the shapes and images indexed to them. The models of metric pattern theory, in particular group action on the orbit of shapes and forms is a central tool to the formal definitions in Computational anatomy. History Computational anatomy is the study of shape and form at the morphome or gross anatomy millimeter, or morphology scale, focusing on the study of sub-manifolds of {\\\\mathbb R}^3, points, curves surfaces and subvolumes of human anatomy. An early modern computational neuro-anatomist was David Van Essen performing some of the early physical unfoldings of the human brain based on printing of a human cortex and cutting. Jean Talairach's publication of Talairach coordinates is an important milestone at the morphome scale demonstrating the fundamental basis of local coordinate systems in studying neuroanatomy and therefore the clear link to charts of differential geometry. Concurrently, virtual mapping in computational anatomy across high resolution dense image coordinates was already happening in Ruzena Bajcy's and Fred Bookstein's earliest developments based on Computed axial tomography and Magnetic resonance imagery. The earliest introduction of the use of flows of diffeomorphisms for transformation of coordinate systems in image analysis and medical imaging was by Christensen, Joshi, Miller, and Rabbitt. The first formalization of computational anatomy as an orbit of exemplar templates under diffeomorphism group action was in the original lecture given by Grenander and Miller with that title in May 1997 at the 50th Anniversary of the Division of Applied Mathematics at Brown University, and subsequent publication. This was the basis for the strong departure from much of the previous work on advanced methods for spatial normalization and image registration which were historically built on notions of addition and basis expansion. The structure preserving transformations central to the modern field of Computational Anatomy, homeomorphisms and diffeomorphisms carry smooth submanifolds smoothly. They are generated via Lagrangian and Eulerian flows which satisfy a law of composition of functions forming the group property, but are not additive. The original model of computational anatomy was as the triple, (\\\\mathcal{G}, \\\\mathcal{M}, \\\\mathcal{P}) \\\\ , the group g \\\\in \\\\mathcal{G} , the orbit of shapes and forms m \\\\in \\\\mathcal{M} , and the probability laws P which encode the variations of the objects in the orbit. The template or collection of templates are elements in the orbit m_\\\\mathrm{temp} \\\\in \\\\mathcal {M} of shapes. The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations of the equations of motion of computational anatomy took off post 1997 with several pivotal meetings including the 1997 Luminy meeting organized by the Azencott school at Ecole-Normale Cachan on the \\"Mathematics of Shape Recognition\\" and the 1998 Trimestre at Institute Henri Poincar√© organized by David Mumford \\"Questions Math√©matiques en Traitement du Signal et de l'Image\\" which catalyzed the Hopkins-Brown-ENS Cachan groups and subsequent developments and connections of Computational anatomy to developments in global analysis. The developments in computational anatomy included the establishment of the Sobelev smoothness conditions on the diffeomorphometry metric to insure existence of solutions of variational problems in the space of diffeomorphisms, the derivation of the Euler-Lagrange equations characterizing geodesics through the group and associated conservation laws, the demonstration of the metric properties of the right invariant metric, the demonstration that the Euler-Lagrange equations have a well-posed initial value problem with unique solutions for all time, and with the first results on sectional curvatures for the diffeomorphometry metric in landmarked spaces. Following the Los Alamos meeting in 2002, Joshi's original large deformation singular Landmark solutions in Computational anatomy were connected to peaked Solitons or Peakons as solutions for the Camassa-Holm equation. Subsequently, connections were made between Computational anatomy's Euler-Lagrange equations for momentum densities for the right-invariant metric satisfying Sobolev smoothness to Vladimir Arnold's characterization of the Euler equation for incompressible flows as describing geodesics in the group of volume preserving diffeomorphisms. The first algorithms, generally termed LDDMM for large deformation diffeomorphic mapping for computing connections between landmarks in volumes and spherical manifolds, curves, currents and surfaces, volumes, tensors, varifolds, and time-series have followed. These contributions of computational anatomy to the global analysis associated to the infinite dimensional manifolds of subgroups of the diffeomorphism group is far from trivial. The original idea of doing differential geometry, curvature and geodesics on infinite dimensional manifolds goes back to Bernhard Riemann's Habilitation (Ueber die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen); the key modern book laying the foundations of such ideas in global analysis are from Michor. The applications within medical imaging of computational anatomy continued to flourish after two organized meetings at the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics conferences at University of California, Los Angeles. Computational anatomy has been useful in creating accurate models of the atrophy of the human brain at the morphome scale, as well as Cardiac templates, as well as in modeling biological systems. Since the late 1990s, computational anatomy has become an important part of developing emerging technologies for the field of medical imaging. Digital atlases are a fundamental part of modern Medical-school education and in neuroimaging research at the morphome scale. Atlas based methods and virtual textbooks which accommodate variations as in deformable templates are at the center of many neuro-image analysis platforms including Freesurfer, FSL, MRIStudio, SPM. Diffeomorphic registration, introduced in the 1990s, is now an important player with existing codes bases organized around ANTS, DARTEL, DEMONS, LDDMM, StationaryLDDMM, FastLDDMM, are examples of actively used computational codes for constructing correspondences between coordinate systems based on sparse features and dense images. Voxel-based morphometry is an important technology built on many of these principles. The deformable template orbit model of computational anatomy The model of human anatomy is a deformable template, an orbit of exemplars under group action. Deformable template models have been central to Grenander's Metric Pattern theory, accounting for typicality via templates, and accounting for variability via transformation of the template. An orbit under group action as the representation of the deformable template is a classic formulation from differential geometry. The space of shapes are denoted m \\\\in \\\\mathcal {M}, with the group (\\\\mathcal{ G}, \\\\circ ) with law of composition \\\\circ; the action of the group on shapes is denoted g \\\\cdot m, where the action of the group g \\\\cdot m \\\\in \\\\mathcal{M}, m \\\\in \\\\mathcal {M} is defined to satisfy : (g \\\\circ g^\\\\prime) \\\\cdot m=g \\\\cdot (g^\\\\prime \\\\cdot m)\\\\in \\\\mathcal { M} . The orbit \\\\mathcal{M} of the template becomes the space of all shapes, \\\\mathcal{M} \\\\doteq \\\\\\\\{ m=g \\\\cdot m_\\\\mathrm{temp}, g \\\\in \\\\mathcal{G} \\\\\\\\}, being homogenous under the action of the elements of \\\\mathcal{G}. Figure depicting three medial temporal lobe structures amgydala, entorhinal cortex and hippocampus with fiducial landmarks depicted as well embedded in the MRI background. The orbit model of computational anatomy is an abstract algebra - to be compared to linear algebra- since the groups act nonlinearly on the shapes. This is a generalization of the classical models of linear algebra, in which the set of finite dimensional {\\\\mathbb R}^n vectors are replaced by the finite-dimensional anatomical submanifolds (points, curves, surfaces and volumes) and images of them, and the n \\\\times n matrices of linear algebra are replaced by coordinate transformations based on linear and affine groups and the more general high-dimensional diffeomorphism groups. Shapes and forms The central objects are shapes or forms in computational anatomy, one set of examples being the 0,1,2,3-dimensional submanifolds of {\\\\mathbb R}^3 , a second set of examples being images generated via medical imaging such as via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Triangulated mesh surfaces depicting subcortical structures amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, caudate, putamen, ventricles.The shapes are denoted m(u), u \\\\in U\\\\subset {\\\\mathbb R}^1 \\\\rightarrow {\\\\mathbb R}^2 represented as triangulated meshes. The 0-dimensional manifolds are landmarks or fiducial points; 1-dimensional manifolds are curves such as sulcul and gyral curves in the brain; 2-dimensional manifolds correspond to boundaries of substructures in anatomy such as the subcortical structures of the midbrain or the gyral surface of the neocortex; subvolumes correspond to subregions of the human body, the heart, the thalamus, the kidney. The landmarks X \\\\doteq \\\\\\\\{ x_1,\\\\dots,x_n \\\\\\\\} \\\\subset {\\\\mathbb R}^3 \\\\in \\\\mathcal{M} are a collections of points with no other structure, delineating important fiducials within human shape and form (see associated landmarked image). The sub-manifold shapes such as surfaces X \\\\subset {\\\\mathbb R}^3 \\\\in \\\\mathcal{M} are collections of points modeled as parametrized by a local chart or immersion m:U \\\\subset {\\\\mathbb R}^{1,2} \\\\rightarrow {\\\\mathbb R}^3 , m(u), u \\\\in U (see Figure showing shapes as mesh surfaces). The images such as MR images or DTI images I \\\\in \\\\mathcal{M}, and are dense functions I(x), x \\\\in X \\\\subset {\\\\mathbb R}^{1,2,3} are scalars, vectors, and matrices (see Figure showing scalar image). Groups and group actions Showing an MRI section through a 3D brain representing a scalar image I(x), x \\\\in {\\\\mathbb R}^2 based on T1-weighting.Groups and group actions are familiar to the Engineering community with the universal popularization and standardization of linear algebra as a basic model for analyzing signals and systems in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and applied mathematics. In linear algebra the matrix groups (matrices with inverses) are the central structure, with group action defined by the usual definition of A as an n\\\\times n matrix, acting on x \\\\in {\\\\mathbb R}^n as n \\\\times 1 vectors; the orbit in linear-algebra is the set of n-vectors given by y=A \\\\cdot x \\\\in {\\\\mathbb R}^n, which is a group action of the matrices through the orbit of {\\\\mathbb R}^n. The central group in computational anatomy defined on volumes in {\\\\mathbb R}^3 are the diffeomorphisms \\\\mathcal{G} \\\\doteq Diff which are mappings with 3-components \\\\phi(\\\\cdot)=(\\\\phi_1(\\\\cdot),\\\\phi_2 (\\\\cdot),\\\\phi_3 (\\\\cdot)), law of composition of functions \\\\phi \\\\circ \\\\phi^\\\\prime (\\\\cdot)\\\\doteq \\\\phi (\\\\phi^\\\\prime(\\\\cdot)) , with inverse \\\\phi \\\\circ \\\\phi^{-1}(\\\\cdot)=\\\\phi ( \\\\phi^{-1}(\\\\cdot))=id. Most popular are scalar images, I(x),x \\\\in {\\\\mathbb R}^3, with action on the right via the inverse. : \\\\phi \\\\cdot I(x)=I \\\\circ \\\\phi^{-1} (x), x \\\\in {\\\\mathbb R}^3 . For sub-manifolds X \\\\subset {\\\\mathbb R}^3 \\\\in \\\\mathcal{M} , parametrized by a chart or immersion m(u), u \\\\in U , the diffeomorphic action the flow of the position : \\\\phi \\\\cdot m(u) \\\\doteq \\\\phi\\\\circ m(u), u \\\\in U . Several group actions in computational anatomy have been defined. Lagrangian and Eulerian flows for generating diffeomorphisms For the study of rigid body kinematics, the low-dimensional matrix Lie groups have been the central focus. The matrix groups are low- dimensional mappings, which are diffeomorphisms that provide one-to-one correspondences between coordinate systems, with a smooth inverse. The matrix group of rotations and scales can be generated via a closed form finite- dimensional matrices which are solution of simple ordinary differential equations with solutions given by the matrix exponential. For the study of deformable shape in computational anatomy, a more general diffeomorphism group has been the group of choice, which is the infinite dimensional analogue. The high-dimensional differeomorphism groups used in Computational Anatomy are generated via smooth flows \\\\phi_t, t \\\\in [0,1] which satisfy the Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow fields as first introduced in., satisfying the ordinary differential equation: Showing the Lagrangian flow of coordinates x \\\\in X with associated vector fields v_t, t \\\\in [0,1] satisfying ordinary differential equation \\\\dot \\\\phi_t=v_t(\\\\phi_t), \\\\phi_0=id. with v \\\\doteq (v_1,v_2,v_3) the vector fields on {\\\\mathbb R}^3 termed the Eulerian velocity of the particles at position \\\\phi of the flow.

The inverse \\\\phi_t^{-1}, t \\\\in [0,1] required for the group is defined on the Eulerian vector-field with advective inverse flow The diffeomorphism group of computational anatomy The group of diffeomorphisms is very big. To ensure smooth flows of diffeomorphisms avoiding shock-like solutions for the inverse, the vector fields must be at least 1-time continuously differentiable in space.P. Dupuis, U. Grenander, M.I. Miller, Existence of Solutions on Flows of Diffeomorphisms, Quarterly of Applied Math, 1997. A. Trouv√©. Action de groupe de dimension infinie et reconnaissance de formes. C R Acad Sci Paris S√©r I Math, 321(8):1031‚Äì 1034, 1995. For diffeomorphisms on {\\\\mathbb R}^3 , vector fields are modelled as elements of the Hilbert space (V, \\\\\\\\cdot \\\\_V ) using the Sobolev embedding theorems so that each element has strictly greater than 2 generalized square-integrable spatial derivatives (thus v_i \\\\in H_0^3, i=1,2,3, is sufficient), yielding 1-time continuously differentiable functions. The diffeomorphism group are flows with vector fields absolutely integrable in Sobolev norm: where \\\\v\\\\_V^2 \\\\doteq \\\\int_X Av\\\\cdot v dx, \\\\ v \\\\in V \\\\ , with the linear operator A mapping to the dual space A: V \\\\mapsto V^*, with the integral calculated by integration by parts when Av \\\\in V^* is a generalized function in the dual space. {{HideSobolev smoothness and Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space with Green's kernel The Sobolev smoothness condition on vector fields as modeled in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space The modelling approach used in computational anatomy enforces a continuous differentiability condition on the vector fields by modelling the space of vector fields (V, \\\\\\\\cdot \\\\_V ) as a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), with the norm defined by a 1-1, differential operator A: V \\\\rightarrow V^* , Green's inverse K=A^{-1}.

The diffeomorphometry metric measures how close and far two shapes or images are from each other; the metric length is the shortest length of the flow which carries one coordinate system into the other. Oftentimes, the familiar Euclidean metric is not directly applicable because the patterns of shapes and images don't form a vector space. In the Riemannian orbit model of computational anatomy, diffeomorphisms acting on the forms \\\\phi \\\\cdot m \\\\in \\\\mathcal {M}, \\\\phi \\\\in Diff_V, m \\\\in \\\\mathcal{M} don't act linearly. There are many ways to define metrics, and for the sets associated to shapes the Hausdorff metric is another. The method we use to induce the Riemannian metric is used to induce the metric on the orbit of shapes by defining it in terms of the metric length between diffeomorphic coordinate system transformations of the flows. Measuring the lengths of the geodesic flow between coordinates systems in the orbit of shapes is called diffeomorphometry. The right-invariant metric on diffeomorphisms Define the distance on the group of diffeomorphisms this is the right-invariant metric of diffeomorphometry, invariant to reparameterization of space since for all \\\\phi \\\\in Diff_V , : d_{Diff_V}(\\\\psi, \\\\varphi)=d_{Diff_V}(\\\\psi \\\\circ \\\\phi, \\\\varphi \\\\circ \\\\phi).

The action integral for Hamilton's principle on diffeomorphic flows In classical mechanics the evolution of physical systems is described by solutions to the Euler‚ÄìLagrange equations associated to the Least-action principle of Hamilton. This is a standard way, for example of obtaining Newton's laws of motion of free particles. More generally, the Euler-Lagrange equations can be derived for systems of generalized coordinates. The Euler-Lagrange equation in computational anatomy describes the geodesic shortest path flows between coordinate systems of the diffeomorphism metric. In computational anatomy the generalized coordinates are the flow of the diffeomorphism and its Lagrangian velocity \\\\phi, \\\\dot{\\\\phi}, the two related via the Eulerian velocity v \\\\doteq \\\\dot{\\\\phi} \\\\circ \\\\phi^{-1}. Hamilton's principle for generating the Euler- Lagrange equation requires the action integral on the Lagrangian given by the Lagrangian is given by the kinetic energy: Diffeomorphic or Eulerian shape momentum In computational anatomy, Av was first called the Eulerian or diffeomorphic shape momentum since when integrated against Eulerian velocity v gives energy density, and since there is a conservation of diffeomorphic shape momentum which holds. The operator A is the generalized moment of inertia or inertial operator. The Euler‚ÄìLagrange equation on shape momentum for geodesics on the group of diffeomorphisms Classical calculation of the Euler-Lagrange equation from Hamilton's principle requires the perturbation of the Lagrangian on the vector field in the kinetic energy with respect to first order perturbation of the flow. This requires adjustment by the Lie bracket of vector field, given by operator ad_v: w \\\\in V \\\\mapsto V which involves the Jacobian given by : ad_v[w]\\\\doteq [v,w]\\\\doteq (Dv)w-(Dw)v \\\\in V . Defining the adjoint ad_v^*: V^* \\\\rightarrow V^*, then the first order variation gives the Eulerian shape momentum Av \\\\in V^* satisfying the generalized equation: meaning for all smooth w \\\\in V , : \\\\int_X \\\\left( \\\\frac{d}{dt} Av_t + ad_{v_t}^* (Av_t) \\\\right) \\\\cdot w dx=\\\\int_X \\\\frac{d}{dt} Av_t \\\\cdot w dx + \\\\int_X Av_t \\\\cdot ((Dv_t)w-(Dw)v_t) dx=0 . Computational anatomy is the study of the motions of submanifolds, points, curves, surfaces and volumes. Momentum associated to points, curves and surfaces are all singular, implying the momentum is concentrated on subsets of {\\\\mathbb R}^3 which are dimension \\\\leq 2 in Lebesgue measure. In such cases, the energy is still well defined (Av_t\\\\mid v_t) since although Av_t is a generalized function, the vector fields are smooth and the Eulerian momentum is understood via its action on smooth functions. The perfect illustration of this is even when it is a superposition of delta-diracs, the velocity of the coordinates in the entire volume move smoothly. The Euler-Lagrange equation () on diffeomorphisms for generalized functions Av \\\\in V^* was derived in.M.I. Miller, A. Trouve, L. Younes, Geodesic Shooting in Computational Anatomy, IJCV, 2006. In Riemannian Metric and Lie-Bracket Interpretation of the Euler-Lagrange Equation on Geodesics derivations are provided in terms of the adjoint operator and the Lie bracket for the group of diffeomorphisms. It has come to be called EPDiff equation for diffeomorphisms connecting to the Euler-Poincare method having been studied in the context of the inertial operator A=identity for incompressible, divergence free, fluids. Diffeomorphic shape momentum: a classical vector function For the momentum density case (Av_t \\\\mid w)=\\\\int_X \\\\mu_t \\\\cdot w \\\\, dx , then Euler‚ÄìLagrange equation has a classical solution:The Euler-Lagrange equation on diffeomorphisms, classically defined for momentum densities first appeared in for medical image analysis. Riemannian exponential (geodesic positioning) and Riemannian logarithm (geodesic coordinates) In medical imaging and computational anatomy, positioning and coordinatizing shapes are fundamental operations; the system for positioning anatomical coordinates and shapes built on the metric and the Euler-Lagrange equation a geodesic positioning system as first explicated in Miller Trouve and Younes. Solving the geodesic from the initial condition v_0 is termed the Riemannian-exponential, a mapping Exp_{\\\\rm id}(\\\\cdot): V \\\\to Diff_V at identity to the group.

The Lagrange multiplier in its action as a linear form has its own inner product of the canonical momentum acting on the velocity of the flow which is dependent on the shape, e.g. for landmarks a sum, for surfaces a surface integral, and. for volumes it is a volume integral with respect to dx on {\\\\mathbb R}^3.

The geodesi of EL implies specification of the vector fields v_0 or Eulerian momentum Av_0 at t=0, or specification of canonical momentum p_0 determines the flow. The metric on geodesic flows of landmarks, surfaces, and volumes within the orbit In computational anatomy the submanifolds are pointsets, curves, surfaces and subvolumes which are the basic primitives. The geodesic flows between the submanifolds determine the distance, and form the basic measuring and transporting tools of diffeomorphometry. At t=0 the geodesic has vector field v_0=K p_0 determined by the conjugate momentum and the Green's kernel of the inertial operator defining the Eulerian momentum K=A^{-1}.

Dense image matching in computational anatomy Dense image matching has a long history now with the earliest efforts exploiting a small deformation framework. Large deformations began in the early 1990s, with the first existence to solutions to the variational problem for flows of diffeomorphisms for dense image matching established in. Beg solved via one of the earliest LDDMM algorithms based on solving the variational matching with endpoint defined by the dense imagery with respect to the vector fields, taking variations with respect to the vector fields. Another solution for dense image matching reparameterizes the optimization problem in terms of the state q_t \\\\doteq I \\\\circ \\\\phi_t^{-1}, q_0=I giving the solution in terms of the infinitesimal action defined by the advection equation.

Dense LDDMM tensor matching takes the images as 3x1 vectors and 3x3 tensors solving the variational problem matching between coordinate system based on the principle eigenvectors of the diffusion tensor MRI image (DTI) denoted M(x), x \\\\in {\\\\mathbb R}^3 consisting of the 3 \\\\times 3-tensor at every voxel.

Coordinate system transformation based on DTI imaging has exploited two actions one based on the principle eigen-vector or entire matrix. LDDMM matching based on the principal eigenvector of the diffusion tensor matrix takes the image I(x), x \\\\in {\\\\mathbb R}^3 as a unit vector field defined by the first eigenvector. The group action becomes : \\\\varphi \\\\cdot I= \\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{D_{\\\\varphi^{-1}} \\\\varphi I \\\\circ \\\\varphi^{-1} \\\\I \\\\circ \\\\varphi^{-1}\\\\}{\\\\D_{\\\\varphi^{-1}} \\\\varphi I \\\\circ \\\\varphi^{-1}\\\\} & I\\\\circ \\\\varphi eq 0; \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{otherwise.} \\\\end{cases} LDDMM matching based on the entire tensor matrix has group action becomes \\\\varphi \\\\cdot M=(\\\\lambda_1 \\\\hat{e}_1 \\\\hat{e}_1^{T}+\\\\lambda_2 \\\\hat{e}_2 \\\\hat{e}_2^{T} +\\\\lambda_3 \\\\hat{e}_3 \\\\hat{e}_3^{T}) \\\\circ \\\\varphi^{-1} , transformed eigenvectors :\\\\begin{align} \\\\hat{e}_1 &=\\\\frac{D \\\\varphi e_1}{\\\\D \\\\varphi e_1\\\\} \\\\ , \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\hat{e}_2=\\\\frac{D \\\\varphi e_2-\\\\langle \\\\hat{e}_1,D \\\\varphi e_2\\\\rangle \\\\hat{e}_1}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\D \\\\varphi e_2\\\\^2-\\\\langle \\\\hat{e}_1,D \\\\varphi e_2\\\\rangle^2}}\\\\ , \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\hat{e}_3=\\\\hat{e}_1 \\\\times \\\\hat{e}_2 \\\\end{align}. The variational problem matching onto the principal eigenvector or the matrix is described LDDMM Tensor Image Matching. High Angular Resolution Diffusion Image (HARDI) matching in computational anatomy High angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) addresses the well-known limitation of DTI, that is, DTI can only reveal one dominant fiber orientation at each location. HARDI measures diffusion along n uniformly distributed directions on the sphere and can characterize more complex fiber geometries. HARDI can be used to reconstruct an orientation distribution function (ODF) that characterizes the angular profile of the diffusion probability density function of water molecules. The ODF is a function defined on a unit sphere, {\\\\mathbb{S}}^2 . Dense LDDMM ODF matching takes the HARDI data as ODF at each voxel and solves the LDDMM variational problem in the space of ODF. In the field of information geometry, the space of ODF forms a Riemannian manifold with the Fisher-Rao metric. For the purpose of LDDMM ODF mapping, the square-root representation is chosen because it is one of the most efficient representations found to date as the various Riemannian operations, such as geodesics, exponential maps, and logarithm maps, are available in closed form. In the following, denote square-root ODF ({\\\\sqrt{\\\\text{ODF}}} ) as \\\\psi({\\\\bf s}) , where \\\\psi({\\\\bf s}) is non-negative to ensure uniqueness and \\\\int_{{\\\\bf s}\\\\in {\\\\mathbb{S}}^2} \\\\psi^2({\\\\bf s}) d{\\\\bf s}=1. The variational problem for matching assumes that two ODF volumes can be generated from one to another via flows of diffeomorphisms \\\\phi_t , which are solutions of ordinary differential equations \\\\dot \\\\phi_t=v_t (\\\\phi_t), t \\\\in [0,1], starting from the identity map \\\\phi_0={id} . Denote the action of the diffeomorphism on template as \\\\phi_1 \\\\cdot \\\\psi_{\\\\mathrm{temp}}({\\\\bf s},x), {\\\\bf s} \\\\in {{\\\\mathbb{S}}^2} , x \\\\in X are respectively the coordinates of the unit sphere, {{\\\\mathbb{S}}^2} and the image domain, with the target indexed similarly, \\\\psi_{\\\\mathrm{targ}}({\\\\bf s}, x), {\\\\bf s} \\\\in {{\\\\mathbb{S}}^2} , x \\\\in X . The group action of the diffeomorphism on the template is given according to :\\\\phi_1 \\\\cdot \\\\psi (x)\\\\doteq (D\\\\phi_1) \\\\psi \\\\circ \\\\phi_1^{-1}(x), x \\\\in X , where (D\\\\phi_1) is the Jacobian of the affined transformed ODF and is defined as \\\\begin{align} (D \\\\phi_1) \\\\psi\\\\circ \\\\phi_1^{-1}(x)=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\det{\\\\bigl(D_{\\\\phi_1^{-1}}\\\\phi_1 \\\\bigr)^{-1}} }{\\\\left\\\\{\\\\bigl(D_{\\\\phi_1^{-1}}\\\\phi_1 \\\\bigr)^{-1} } {\\\\bf s} \\\\right\\\\^3} } \\\\quad \\\\psi \\\\left( \\\\frac{(D_{\\\\phi_1^{-1}}\\\\phi_1 \\\\bigr)^{-1} {\\\\bf s}}{\\\\(D_{\\\\phi_1^{-1}}\\\\phi_1 \\\\bigr)^{-1} {\\\\bf s}\\\\}, \\\\phi_1^{-1}(x) \\\\right) . \\\\end{align} This group action of diffeomorphisms on ODF reorients the ODF and reflects changes in both the magnitude of \\\\psi and the sampling directions of \\\\bf s due to affine transformation. It guarantees that the volume fraction of fibers oriented toward a small patch must remain the same after the patch is transformed. The LDDMM variational problem is defined as : \\\\begin{align} C(v)=\\\\inf_{v: \\\\dot \\\\phi_t= v_t \\\\circ \\\\phi_t,\\\\phi_0={ id}}\\\\int_0^1 \\\\int_X Av_t \\\\cdot v_t dx \\\\ dt +\\\\lambda \\\\int_{x\\\\in\\\\Omega}\\\\\\\\log_{(D\\\\phi_1) \\\\psi_{\\\\mathrm{temp}} \\\\circ \\\\phi_1^{-1}(x)}(\\\\psi_{\\\\mathrm{targ}}(x))\\\\^2_{(D\\\\phi_1) \\\\psi_{\\\\mathrm{temp}}\\\\circ \\\\phi_1^{-1}(x)}dx \\\\end{align} . where the logarithm of \\\\psi_1, \\\\psi_2 \\\\in \\\\Psi is defined as : \\\\begin{align} \\\\\\\\log_{\\\\psi_1}(\\\\psi_2)\\\\_{\\\\psi_1} =\\\\cos^{-1} \\\\langle \\\\psi_1, \\\\psi_2 \\\\rangle= \\\\cos^{-1}\\\\left(\\\\int_{{\\\\bf s}\\\\in {\\\\mathbb{S}}^2} \\\\psi_1({\\\\bf s}) \\\\psi_2({\\\\bf s})d{\\\\bf s}\\\\right), \\\\end{align} where \\\\langle \\\\cdot, \\\\cdot \\\\rangle is the normal dot product between points in the sphere under the \\\\mathrm{L}^2 metric. This LDDMM-ODF mapping algorithm has been widely used to study brain white matter degeneration in aging, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia. The brain white matter atlas generated based on ODF is constructed via Bayesian estimation. Regression analysis on ODF is developed in the ODF manifold space in. Metamorphosis Morphing technologies such as the Michael Jackson video. Notice the insertion of tumor gray level intensity which does not exist in template. The principle mode of variation represented by the orbit model is change of coordinates. For setting in which pairs of images are not related by diffeomorphisms but have photometric variation or image variation not represented by the template, active appearance modelling has been introduced, originally by Edwards-Cootes-Taylor and in 3D medical imaging in. In the context of computational anatomy in which metrics on the anatomical orbit has been studied, metamorphosis for modelling structures such as tumors and photometric changes which are not resident in the template was introduced in for Magnetic Resonance image models, with many subsequent developments extending the metamorphosis framework. For image matching the image metamorphosis framework enlarges the action so that t \\\\mapsto (\\\\phi_t,I_t) with action \\\\phi_t \\\\cdot I_t \\\\doteq I_t \\\\circ \\\\phi_t^{-1} . In this setting metamorphosis combines both the diffeomorphic coordinate system transformation of computational anatomy as well as the early morphing technologies which only faded or modified the photometric or image intensity alone. Then the matching problem takes a form with equality boundary conditions: : \\\\min_{(v,I)} \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\int_0^1 \\\\left( \\\\int_X A v_t \\\\cdot v_t dx + \\\\\\\\dot I_t \\\\circ \\\\phi_t^{-1} \\\\^2 / \\\\sigma^2 \\\\right) \\\\, dt \\\\text{ subject to} \\\\ \\\\phi_0=id, I_0=\\\\text{fixed}, I_1=\\\\text{fixed} Matching landmarks, curves, surfaces Transforming coordinate systems based on Landmark point or fiducial marker features dates back to Bookstein's early work on small deformation spline methods for interpolating correspondences defined by fiducial points to the two-dimensional or three-dimensional background space in which the fiducials are defined. Large deformation landmark methods came on in the late 1990s. The above Figure depicts a series of landmarks associated three brain structures, the amygdala, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus. Matching geometrical objects like unlabelled point distributions, curves or surfaces is another common problem in computational anatomy. Even in the discrete setting where these are commonly given as vertices with meshes, there are no predetermined correspondences between points as opposed to the situation of landmarks described above. From the theoretical point of view, while any submanifold X in {\\\\mathbb R}^3 , d=1,2,3 can be parameterized in local charts m: u \\\\in U \\\\subset {\\\\mathbb R}^{0,1,2,3} \\\\rightarrow {\\\\mathbb R}^3 , all reparametrizations of these charts give geometrically the same manifold. Therefore, early on in computational anatomy, investigators have identified the necessity of parametrization invariant representations. One indispensable requirement is that the end-point matching term between two submanifolds is itself independent of their parametrizations. This can be achieved via concepts and methods borrowed from Geometric measure theory, in particular currents and varifolds which have been used extensively for curve and surface matching.

Measure matching: unregistered landmarks Glaunes and co-workers first introduced diffeomorphic matching of pointsets in the general setting of matching distributions. As opposed to landmarks, this includes in particular the situation of weighted point clouds with no predefined correspondences and possibly different cardinalities. The template and target discrete point clouds are represented as two weighted sums of Diracs \\\\mu_{m}=\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\\\rho_i \\\\delta_{x_i} and \\\\mu_{m^\\\\prime}=\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n^\\\\prime} \\\\rho^{\\\\prime}_{i} \\\\delta_{x^{\\\\prime}_{i}} living in the space of signed measures of \\\\mathbb{R}^3 . The space is equipped with a Hilbert metric obtained from a real positive kernel k(x,y) on \\\\mathbb{R}^3 , giving the following norm: : \\\\\\\\mu_{m} \\\\_\\\\mathrm{mea}^2=\\\\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} \\\\rho_i \\\\rho_j k(x_i,x_j) The matching problem between a template and target point cloud may be then formulated using this kernel metric for the endpoint matching term: : \\\\min_{\\\\phi: v=\\\\dot \\\\phi \\\\circ \\\\phi^{-1}} C(\\\\phi) \\\\doteq \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\int (Av_t\\\\mid v_t) \\\\, dt +\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\\\\\mu_{\\\\phi_1 \\\\cdot m} - \\\\mu_{m^\\\\prime} \\\\_\\\\mathrm{mea}^2 where \\\\mu_{\\\\phi_1 \\\\cdot m}=\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\\\rho_i \\\\delta_{\\\\phi_1(x_i)} is the distribution transported by the deformation. Curve matching In the one dimensional case, a curve in 3D can be represented by an embedding m: u \\\\in [0,1] \\\\rightarrow {\\\\mathbb R}^3 , and the group action of Diff becomes \\\\phi \\\\cdot m=\\\\phi \\\\circ m. However, the correspondence between curves and embeddings is not one to one as the any reparametrization m \\\\circ \\\\gamma, for \\\\gamma a diffeomorphism of the interval [0,1], represents geometrically the same curve. In order to preserve this invariance in the end-point matching term, several extensions of the previous 0-dimensional measure matching approach can be considered. * Curve matching with currents In the situation of oriented curves, currents give an efficient setting to construct invariant matching terms. In such representation, curves are interpreted as elements of a functional space dual to the space vector fields, and compared through kernel norms on these spaces. Matching of two curves m and m^\\\\prime writes eventually as the variational problem : \\\\min_{\\\\phi: v=\\\\dot \\\\phi \\\\circ \\\\phi^{-1}} C(\\\\phi) \\\\doteq \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\int (Av_t\\\\mid v_t) \\\\, dt +\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\\\\\mathcal{C}_{\\\\phi_1 \\\\cdot m} - \\\\mathcal{C}_{m^\\\\prime} \\\\_\\\\mathrm{cur}^2 with the endpoint term E(\\\\phi_1)=\\\\\\\\mathcal{C}_{\\\\phi_1 \\\\cdot m} - \\\\mathcal{C}_{m^\\\\prime} \\\\_\\\\mathrm{cur}^2/2 is obtained from the norm : \\\\\\\\mathcal{C}_{m} \\\\_\\\\mathrm{cur}^2=\\\\int_0^1 \\\\int_0^1 K_C(m(u),m(v)) \\\\partial m(u) \\\\cdot \\\\partial m(v) \\\\, du \\\\, dv the derivative \\\\partial m(u) being the tangent vector to the curve and K_{\\\\mathcal{C}} a given matrix kernel of {\\\\mathbb R}^3 . Such expressions are invariant to any positive reparametrizations of m and m', and thus still depend on the orientation of the two curves. * Curve matching with varifolds Varifold is an alternative to currents when orientation becomes an issue as for instance in situations involving multiple bundles of curves for which no \\"consistent\\" orientation may be defined. Varifolds directly extend 0-dimensional measures by adding an extra tangent space direction to the position of points, leading to represent curves as measures on the product of {\\\\mathbb R}^3 and the Grassmannian of all straight lines in {\\\\mathbb R}^3 . The matching problem between two curves then consists in replacing the endpoint matching term by E(\\\\phi_1)=\\\\\\\\mathcal{V}_{\\\\phi_1 \\\\cdot m} - \\\\mathcal{V}_{m^\\\\prime} \\\\_{cur}^2/2 with varifold norms of the form: : \\\\\\\\mathcal{V}_m \\\\_{var}^2=\\\\int_{0}^1 \\\\int_{0}^1 k_{\\\\mathbb{R}^3}(m(u),m(v)) k_{\\\\mathbf{Gr}}\\\\left([\\\\partial m(u)],[\\\\partial m(v)] \\\\right) \\\\partial m(u) \\\\partial m(v) \\\\, du \\\\, dv where [\\\\partial m(u)] is the non-oriented line directed by tangent vector \\\\partial m(u) and k_{\\\\mathbb{R}^3}, k_{\\\\mathbf{Gr}} two scalar kernels respectively on \\\\mathbb{R}^3 and the Grassmannian. Due to the inherent non-oriented nature of the Grassmannian representation, such expressions are invariant to positive and negative reparametrizations. Surface matching Surface matching share many similarities with the case of curves. Surfaces in {\\\\mathbb R}^3 are parametrized in local charts by embeddings m: u \\\\in U \\\\subset {\\\\mathbb R}^{2} \\\\rightarrow {\\\\mathbb R}^3 , with all reparametrizations m\\\\circ \\\\gamma with \\\\gamma a diffeomorphism of U being equivalent geometrically. Currents and varifolds can be also used to formalize surface matching. * Surface matching with currents Oriented surfaces can be represented as 2-currents which are dual to differential 2-forms. In {\\\\mathbb R}^3 , one can further identify 2-forms with vector fields through the standard wedge product of 3D vectors. In that setting, surface matching writes again: : \\\\min_{\\\\phi: v=\\\\dot \\\\phi \\\\circ \\\\phi^{-1}} C(\\\\phi) \\\\doteq \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\int (Av_t\\\\mid v_t) \\\\, dt +\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\\\\\mathcal{C}_{\\\\phi_1 \\\\cdot m} - \\\\mathcal{C}_{m^\\\\prime} \\\\_\\\\mathrm{cur}^2 with the endpoint term E(\\\\phi_1)=\\\\\\\\mathcal{C}_{\\\\phi_1 \\\\cdot m} - \\\\mathcal{C}_{m^\\\\prime} \\\\_\\\\mathrm{cur}^2/2 given through the norm : \\\\\\\\mathcal{C}_{m} \\\\_\\\\mathrm{cur}^2=\\\\iint_{U\\\\times U} K_C(m(u),m(v)) \\\\vec{n}(u) \\\\cdot \\\\vec{n}(v) \\\\, du \\\\, dv with \\\\vec{n}=\\\\partial_{u_1} m \\\\wedge \\\\partial_{u_2} m the normal vector to the surface parametrized by m . This surface mapping algorithm has been validated for brain cortical surfaces against CARET and FreeSurfer. LDDMM mapping for multiscale surfaces is discussed in. * Surface matching with varifolds For non-orientable or non- oriented surfaces, the varifold framework is often more adequate. Identifying the parametric surface m with a varifold \\\\mathcal{V}_m in the space of measures on the product of {\\\\mathbb R}^3 and the Grassmannian, one simply replaces the previous current metric \\\\\\\\mathcal{C}_{m} \\\\_\\\\mathrm{cur}^2 by: : \\\\\\\\mathcal{V}_{m} \\\\_\\\\mathrm{var}^2=\\\\iint_{U\\\\times U} k_{\\\\mathbb{R}^3}(m(u),m(v)) k_{\\\\mathbf{Gr}}\\\\left([\\\\vec{n}(u)],[\\\\vec{n}(v)] \\\\right) \\\\vec{n}(u) \\\\vec{n}(v) \\\\, du \\\\, dv where [\\\\vec{n}(u)] is the (non- oriented) line directed by the normal vector to the surface. Growth and atrophy from longitudinal time-series There are many settings in which there are a series of measurements, a time-series to which the underlying coordinate systems will be matched and flowed onto. This occurs for example in the dynamic growth and atrophy models and motion tracking such as have been explored in An observed time sequence is given and the goal is to infer the time flow of geometric change of coordinates carrying the exemplars or templars through the period of observations. The generic time-series matching problem considers the series of times is 0 < t_1 < \\\\dots t_K=1. The flow optimizes at the series of costs E(t_k), k=1, \\\\dots, K giving optimization problems of the form : \\\\min_{\\\\phi:v=\\\\dot \\\\phi \\\\circ \\\\phi^{-1}, \\\\phi_0=id} C(\\\\phi) \\\\doteq \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\int_0^1 (Av_t\\\\mid v_t) \\\\, dt +\\\\sum_{k=1}^K E( \\\\phi_{t_k}) . There have been at least three solutions offered thus far, piecewise geodesic, principal geodesic and splines.

The random orbit model of computational anatomy first appeared in modelling the change in coordinates associated to the randomness of the group acting on the templates, which induces the randomness on the source of images in the anatomical orbit of shapes and forms and resulting observations through the medical imaging devices. Such a random orbit model in which randomness on the group induces randomness on the images was examined for the Special Euclidean Group for object recognition in.

Statistical shape theory in computational anatomy Shape in computational anatomy is a local theory, indexing shapes and structures to templates to which they are bijectively mapped. Statistical shape in computational anatomy is the empirical study of diffeomorphic correspondences between populations and common template coordinate systems. This is a strong departure from Procrustes Analyses and shape theories pioneered by David G. Kendall in that the central group of Kendall's theories are the finite-dimensional Lie groups, whereas the theories of shape in computational anatomy have focused on the diffeomorphism group, which to first order via the Jacobian can be thought of as a field‚Äìthus infinite dimensional‚Äìof low-dimensional Lie groups of scale and rotations. Figure showing hundreds of sub-cortical structures embedded in two-dimensional momentum space generated from the first two eigenvectors of the empirical co- variance estimated from the population of shapes. The random orbit model provides the natural setting to understand empirical shape and shape statistics within computational anatomy since the non-linearity of the induced probability law on anatomical shapes and forms m \\\\in \\\\mathcal{M} is induced via the reduction to the vector fields v_0 \\\\in V at the tangent space at the identity of the diffeomorphism group. The successive flow of the Euler equation induces the random space of shapes and forms Exp_{id}(v_0) \\\\cdot m \\\\in \\\\mathcal{M}. Performing empirical statistics on this tangent space at the identity is the natural way for inducing probability laws on the statistics of shape. Since both the vector fields and the Eulerian momentum Av_0 are in a Hilbert space the natural model is one of a Gaussian random field, so that given test function w \\\\in V, then the inner-products with the test functions are Gaussian distributed with mean and covariance. This is depicted in the accompanying figure where sub-cortical brain structures are depicted in a two- dimensional coordinate system based on inner products of their initial vector fields that generate them from the template is shown in a 2-dimensional span of the Hilbert space. Template estimation from populations Depicting template estimation from multiplie subcortical surfaces in populations of MR images using the EM-algorithm solution of Ma. The study of shape and statistics in populations are local theories, indexing shapes and structures to templates to which they are bijectively mapped. Statistical shape is then the study of diffeomorphic correspondences relative to the template. A core operation is the generation of templates from populations, estimating a shape that is matched to the population. There are several important methods for generating templates including methods based on Frechet averaging, and statistical approaches based on the expectation-maximization algorithm and the Bayes Random orbit models of computational anatomy.

The six-story building was completed in 1892 and it was demolished in 2017 to be replaced by new development. Demolition was underway in August 2017, and it was complete by November of the same year. Description and history The building was designed by Justus F. Krumbein, also the architect of the second Oregon State Capitol. Its style had elements of Richardsonian Romanesque architecture and, according to Restore Oregon, it was one of the city's most prominent buildings from the 1890s that was still extant in the 2010s. Originally serving as a club and office for the Ancient Order of United Workmen (AOUW) fraternal organization, within about 10 years it had been sold by that organization and renamed the Tourny Building, a mixed-use building that initially included apartments. The AOUW retained a library in the building for its members for some years after its sale. The building was sold again in 1905, for $100,000, and again in 1907 for $140,000 (equivalent to $ million in ). The offices of the Oregon Historical Society were in the Tourny Building from 1913 until 1917, and its museum was on the first floor. In 1941, the six-story building was sold to Gilbert Brothers, Inc., who opened a furniture store and warehouse in it. In 1946, a fire gutted the top three floors and destroyed the roof and cornice. Fires has previously broken out in 1916 and 1922, and yet another occurred in 1974, gutting the top two floors. Portland architect Richard Sundeleaf made modifications in 1942 and 1946, and Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Architects in 1980.Historic Resource Inventory datasheet, City of Portland, Oregon, 1984. At an unknown date, the building was designated a historical landmark by the city's Historical Landmarks Commission (now known as the Historic Landmarks Commission), but the commission removed the designation in 1973, after concluding that subsequent repainting had lessened the building's historical significance. Delisting and demolition During demolition (September 2017) In November 2015, it was reported that the City of Portland had removed the building from the city's Historic Resource Inventory, having deemed it unsafe. This opened the possibility of demolition. The Portland Tribune reported in December 2015 that, \\"Plans provided by Ankrom Moisan Architects show a 20-story hotel and 10-story office building rising on the block\\", in place of the 1892 building and the nearby Hotel Albion (Lotus Caf√© building). The completed design for the hotel building proposed to be constructed on the block was approved by the Portland Design Commission, a city-appointed advisory panel, in early July 2016. The plans called for demolition of the United Workmen Temple, and the development team submitted an application for a demolition permit to the city in mid-July 2016. A campaign by the preservation organization Restore Oregon to save the AOUW building and the Hotel Albion was unsuccessful, and the demolition permit was approved in the first months of 2017. In August 2017, visible demolition of the building began, following a few months of preparatory work inside the structure to remove hazardous material before demolition.

The group depicted was Kennington's own infantry platoon; Platoon No 7, C Company, the 1/13th (County of London) Battalion, the London Regiment (Kensington), who were commonly known as the Kensingtons. Kennington completed the painting having been invalided out of the British Army due to wounds suffered on the Western Front in early 1915. The painting is Kennington's most famous work. It has been described as \\"one of the iconic images of the First World War\\",Eric Kennington's Portraits of the British at War at the RAF Museum, London, Ricahrd Moss, Culture24, 13 July 2011 and is held by the Imperial War Museum. When it was first exhibited in 1916, the painting had a large impact and hastened the establishment of an official British scheme for war artists. Background On 6 August 1914, days after the outbreak of the First World War, Kennington enlisted with the 1/13th (Kensington) Battalion of the London Regiment, as their recruiting office was the nearest one to his London studio. After several months of training in England, he fought with his battalion on the Western Front from November 1914, but was wounded in January 1915. One toe of Kennington's left foot was amputated, and he was fortunate not to lose a foot due to a subsequent infection. He spent four months in hospital in London and Liverpool before being discharged as unfit for further service in June 1915. After his convalescence, he spent six months painting The Kensingtons at Laventie. During his few months of active service before he was wounded, Kennington's unit suffered 127 casualties, approximately 20 per cent of its original strength; by the time he completed the painting, 90 per cent of the 700 soldiers who arrived in France with the battalion in late 1914 had been killed or wounded. Description Standing Soldier ‚Äì study for The Kensingtons at Laventie, (Art.IWM ART 15924) The Kensingtons spent the extremely cold winter of 1914 in the front-line trenches forward of the village of Laventie in the Pas-de-Calais. Their trenches were poorly built and frequently under artillery fire. The painting depicts a moment when the platoon, having spent four days and nights in a forward fire trench, have made their way through a flooded communications trench to the ruined village of Laventie. The men are waiting for the order to 'fall in' for the 5 mile march to an overnight billet outside shelling range. The painting is a group portrait of nine soldiers from Kennington's own infantry platoon, Platoon No 7, C Company. Kennington went to great lengths to contact his former comrades and sketch them while preparing the painting. It depicts eight figures standing on the snow-covered ground amid the detritus of war, beside a whitewashed wall, seven in a loose group to the left and one alone on the right overlooked by a calvary cross in the top right corner, while a ninth lies on the ground, exhausted. Kennington supplied extensive notes that identified each individual in the painting and explained the situation depicted. The men depicted, from left to right, are: * Private H Bristol, wearing the red scarf; * Private A McCafferty, with a bandaged head. One of the two rifles on his back belonged to a Private Perry who had been killed by a sniper whilst beside McCafferty in a trench at La Rue Tilleloy and a German Pickelhaube helmet is attached to his belt; * Kennington is third from the left, wearing a balaclava; * Private W Harvey; * Private P A Guy, nicknamed 'Good Little Guy'; * Lance-Corporal H 'Tug' Wilson, wearing a balaclava and with his fork and spoon tucked into his puttee; * Private M Slade, standing with both hands on his rifle; * Corporal J Kealey; * The figure on the ground in the forefront of the painting is Private 'Sweeney' Todd, an under-age soldier who Kennington wrote was \\"exhausted by continual service, hard work, lack of sleep, long hours of 'standing to' and observing\\". Composition Kennington painted the picture in a highly unconventional manner, painting in reverse on glass with the exterior layers applied first and the background last. This method, and Kennington's use of gold to pick out metallic details, gives the painting a particular clarity and luminosity. Whereas an oil painting on canvas will fade with time as the oils sink into the canvas, an oil on glass painting will largely retain its original brightness. Kennington claimed to have travelled some 500 miles while painting the picture in walking from the back of the glass to the front to check the composition. The style of the painting has been compared to the Pre-Raphaelites, Pieter Breughel, and religious icons in the Russian Orthodox tradition; and its composition bears resemblance to Uccellos Battle of San Romano. Reception The painting was first exhibited at the Goupil gallery on Regent Street from April to July 1916, to raise funds for the Star and Garter Building Fund. Its portrayal of exhausted soldiers caused a sensation. The painting was widely praised for its technical virtuosity, iconic colour scheme, and its \\"stately presentation of human endurance, of the quiet heroism of the rank and file\\", showing the war \\"in all its squalor and glory\\". The success of the painting led to the establishment of an official British war artist scheme by the Department of Information. Kennington himself was appointed a war artist and returned to France in 1917. In support of his application to become a war artist, the painter Sir John Lavery wrote \\"Mr Kennington, in my opinion, has painted in ‚ÄúThe Kensingtons‚Äù, the only picture of the Great War that I have seen so far that will actually live.\\" In May 2015, the Royal Mail issued a stamp featuring a detail from the painting as part of a First World War commemorative set.

So far only thirteen specimens have been recorded. Description This species appears orange in color and has two eyes. They have dorsal arms with 47‚Äì58 suckers. Each sucker has a pair of cirri, which are thought to have a role in feeding, by creating currents of water that help bring food closer to their mouth or beak. They feed on worms, bivalves, copepods and crustaceans. The male reproductive tract shows variation between species, and there is confusion identifying certain parts. The Grimpoteuthis Bathynectes is an organism that primarily uses its two fins on its mantle to navigate through the deep ocean floors. They have many unique structures since they dwell in the deep oceans like transparent patches that help them detect light and shell or mantle that makes this species of octopus very different from the rest, meaning not all octopuses have that shell-like structure or transparent patches of skin allowing them to thrive in the deep ocean floor. Habitat Species of this family are believed to exist on the deep ocean floor in all oceans of the world. Specific species have been found in the waters surrounding New Zealand, Australia, Monterey Bay, Oregon, Philippines, Martha's Vineyard, Papua, New Guinea and the Azores.

Dubbed by The New York Times as \\"China's First Lady of Opera\\", she was considered to be the first important instructor of Western opera in China. As a vocalist, she performed in theaters and concert halls across Europe in 1946‚Äì1947; earning the nickname the \\"Chinese Nightingale\\". Under the directive of Premier Zhou Enlai, she began a career teaching voice at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music in 1949. She remained an instructor at the Shanghai Conservatory for more than 65 years. Many of her students went on to highly successful international opera careers. Early life in China Born in Wuhan, Zhou's father, Zhou Cangbai (also known as Chou Tsang-po), was a wealthy banker. She was educated at a Roman Catholic school in Shanghai which exposed her to studies in Western music. She was also influenced in her youth by the White Russian and Jewish musicians who were prevalent in 1930s Shanghai. In 1936, at the age of 18, Zhou began her professional musical training at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music. While a student at the conservatory she was a member in a performance art troupe. She rose to fame in her native country shortly after the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937. Wishing to raise the morale of the Chinese people facing the invasion by Japan, she sang the patriotic song The Great Wall Ballad () at concerts in Wuhan and Singapore which were highly regarded and inspired financial aid and the conscription of soldiers for the war effort. Studies in France and European career In 1938 Zhou left China for studies in France after her voice teacher in Singapore told her that her voice was \\"too throaty\\". She pursued studies at the √âcole Normale de Musique de Paris and later at the Conservatoire russe de Paris Serge Rachmaninoff. While at the latter institution her voice blossomed into a \\"bell-like lyric coloratura\\", and she befriended composer Nikolai Tcherepnin. After eight years of studying, she embarked on a career as a concert soprano, beginning with a performance in Luxembourg in 1946. While she had considered pursuing work as an operatic soprano, she pursued the concert repertoire of composers like Claude Debussy and Gabriel Faur√© instead given that, according to Zhou, \\"China had no opera at that time\\". In 1946 Zhou was a featured soloist at the first Prague Spring International Music Festival; a performance which earned her the nickname the \\"Chinese nightingale\\". While at the festival she became acquainted with many luminary musicians of the 20th century, including Leonard Bernstein, David Oistrakh, Sviatoslav Richter, and Dmitri Shostakovich. Concerts in other major European cities followed from 1946‚Äì1947, including performances in London, Paris, and cities in the Czech Republic, Italy, Germany, and Switzerland. Performing and teaching career in China At the bequest of her father, Zhou abandoned her European concert tour and returned home to Shanghai in 1947. In 1949 she became acquainted with Premier Zhou Enlai and writers Ba Jin and Ding Ling at a cultural conference on literature and art organized by the Chinese government. The three men encouraged her to pursue work performing for and teaching her craft to the people of China. She spent the next ten years performing wherever the Chinese government sent her; whether it be for everyday people at factories and shipyards, or on official tours overseas to the countries of India, Poland, North Korea, and the Soviet Union. She also joined the faculty of the Shanghai Conservatory in 1949. She married Chinese film director Zhang Junxiang on May 5, 1952. Exile With the rise of the Cultural Revolution, Western music was no longer accepted by those in power and Zhou found herself out of favor. She was accused of counter revolutionary activities in 1965. This led to her being exiled on a farm with her husband in the Chinese provinces for five years. Speaking of her experience with The New York Times, Zhou stated: > I was made to realize that I knew very little about my country. It was when > I learned what it is to be Chinese‚Äîbefore I had been so cosmopolitan ... It > was not so brutal. Zhou Enlai couldn't directly help me, but somehow I think > he protected my family, who were mostly in Beijing. Red Guards never went > near their house. Return to Shanghai In 1970 Zhou returned to Shanghai and her post at the conservatory. However, it was not until Deng Xiaoping came into office in 1978 that Zhou was able to achieve the freedom and support she needed to build a high quality opera program. Under Deng, Zhou's program slowly grew in size and strength. In 1988 she established the Zhou Xiaoyan Young Opera Singers Trainee Center on the fourth floor of the Shanghai Conservatory. With the financial backing of the Nanjing government she coordinated a fully staged production of Verdi's Rigoletto in the Chinese language in 1989 at the Shanghai Music Festival with her students as the cast. Several more Chinese language productions followed until a newly forged partnership between the San Francisco Opera and the Shanghai Conservatory enabled productions in other languages to be mounted by the school‚Äîbeginning with a French language production of Gounod's Rom√©o et Juliette in 1996. She and her program flourished with many of her students working successfully on the international stage. Among her pupils were opera singers Liao Changyong, Ying Fang, Ying Huang, Shenyang, Wei Song, Gu Xin, Guanqun Yu, and Jianyi Zhang. Death On March 4, 2016, Zhou died at Ruijin Hospital in Shanghai, aged 98.

History=Foundation Shortly after Cork F.C. folded, an emergency meeting was held to form a new club. Two potential names were proposed ‚Äì Cork Celtic and Cork City. During the 1920s both of these names had been used by teams playing in the Munster Senior League. A team named Cork City also finished as Munster Senior Cup runners up in 1924‚Äì25. Initially, however, the Cork F.C. name was retained as the new club were give permission to complete Cork F.C.'s fixtures from the 1937‚Äì38 League of Ireland season.

New colours were also adopted ‚Äì a strange combination of red, yellow and black hooped shirts. www.corkpastandpresent.ie www.corkpastandpresent.ie Munster Football Association 1938‚Äì39 By 1938‚Äì39 the new club had settled on the Cork City F.C. name. The club also managed to recruit some professional players including Hugh Connolly, Willie Ross, Jim Foley, Jimmy Turnbull and Tom Davis. The club also enjoyed some moderate success. They reached the final of the Dublin City Cup. In the semi-final on 31 August 1938 they defeated Shamrock Rovers 7‚Äì0, a result which remains Rovers' biggest ever defeat. However, in the final Cork City lost 6‚Äì0 to St James's Gate.

However it later emerged that Billy Millar had signed for Cork City while he was still technically contracted to Shelbourne and the club were subsequently fined by the Football Association of Ireland. Like Cork F.C. a few seasons earlier, Cork City began to struggle to raise travel costs for away games in Dublin and the fine received over Millar did not help.

The controversial death of Hernandez-Rojas occurred after a US border deportation dispute involving Federal agent use of taser(s) and alleged excessive force has caused a demand by Mexican government for a through investigation. A national newspaper in Mexico, El Universal, reports up to 20 US federal border agents were beating Mr. Hernandez-Rojas in the presence of various witnesses while he pleaded for mercy. According to a report by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), The San Diego coroner‚Äôs office recorded in addition to a heart attack: ‚Äúseveral loose teeth; bruising to his chest, stomach, hips, knees, back, lips, head and eyelids; five broken ribs; and a damaged spine‚Äù, and classified Anastasio‚Äôs death as a homicide. A U.S. Justice Department announcement on November 6, 2015 of decision to clear the federal agents involved in the death sparked a protest demonstration involving several hundred people. Anastacio Hernandez came to the United States when he was 15, lived there until he was 42 years-old as an undocumented immigrant. He had five children with his common-law wife, Maria Puga. He was deported to Mexico, following an arrest on May 2010 by the San Diego Police for attempting to \\"shoplift steak and tequila from a grocery store.\\" During a failed attempt to reunite with his family in San Diego later in the same year, Hernandez was caught by border agents at the San Diego‚ÄìTijuana border. According to an investigation by the U.S. Justice Department, during the apprehension, Hern√°ndez-Rojas began grappling with the two U.S. Border Patrol agents who apprehended him once they removed his handcuffs; Hern√°ndez-Rojas then resisted their attempts to restrain him. Two Immigrants and Customs Enforcement Agents, as well as another U.S. Border Patrol Agent joined the resultant struggle and struck Hern√°ndez-Rojas several times with their batons. Once re-secured in Handcuffs, Hern√°ndez-Rojas continued to struggle and kick at the arresting agents. Once a transport-vehicle arrived to take Hern√°ndez-Rojas back to the station, since he was then under arrest, being no longer eligible for voluntary re-entry to the United States due to his resistance towards apprehending agents, Hern√°ndez-Rojas again physically resisted the agents and kicked at them as they attempted to place him into the transport vehicle; more Customs and Border Protection officers responded to the scene, one of whom shocked Hernandez-Rojas with a taser. During transport, Hern√°ndez-Rojas' breathing slowed and he became unresponsive. The officers administered CPR until medical personnel arrived at the scene. Hernandez-Rojas was pronounced dead two days later after being removed from life support. Witnesses filmed agents who handcuffed Hernandez, broke five of his ribs and damaged his spine. One of the bystanders, Ashley Young, hid the video card in her pocket when the border police approached the crowd demanding the recordings. Seven years after the incident, the agents had not been disciplined or fired. In February 2017, the United States settled a million-dollar lawsuit with Puga and her children who were represented by attorney Eugene Iredale. In 2013 Nonny de la Pe√±a's, a pioneer in virtual reality, whose work is described as immersive journalism, created a five-minute-long VR called Use of Force, in which she recreated Hern√°ndez's death. In the VR project, which was funded by Tribeca Film Institute, Google, and the Associated Press, viewers witness the event from the viewpoint of bystanders, many of whom had captured the beating on video.

She has been actively creating dance work since the 1980s. She works with dance improvisation and creates choreography that is at times improvised or devised through scores, as well as collaborating with other dancers, visual artists, architects and sceintists. Monson grew up in southern California and, at one point, wanted to be a park ranger. She was awarded the Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists award (1998) and in 2000, Monson received the Creative Capital Performing Arts Award.(http://creative- capital.org/projects/view/249) She now resides in Illinois as a professor at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign, after living in Williamsburg in Brooklyn from 1991‚Äì2002. At one point, she was also involved with the University of Vermont, where she was a professor at large from 2010‚Äì2016 with the dance, environmental studies, and library faculty.  Choreographic Works  Jennifer Monson began choreographing in 1983, after graduating from Sarah Lawrence College in Vermont. In 2000, she began to dive into dance in relationship to the environment almost exclusively, and by 2005, she had created iLAND. Four of her projects, \\"BIRD BRAIN\\", \\"iMAP/Ridgewood Reservoir\\", \\"The Mahomet Aquifer Project\\", and \\"SIP/Watershed\\", were crucial in her career of altering the role that dance plays in people's understanding on the environment. Her works have been presented all over the New York City area including the Kitchen and the Danspace Project.  BIRD BRAIN  One of her first projects, \\"BIRD BRAIN\\", was a touring project that followed the navigational paths of migratory birds and grey whales. The project explored the navigational habits of the animals, along with their physical and metaphorical relationship to humans. It took place over several years (2000-2005), involved site-specific dance performances, discussions with the dancers and scientists involved, workshops for the public, and a website that tracked the animals, as well as the dancers.  iMAP/Ridgewood Reservoir  Her next large project, \\"iMAP (Interdisciplinary Mobile Architecture and Performance)/ Ridgewood Reservoir\\", took place in 2007, and was a collaborative project with architect Gita Nandan, landscape architect Elliott Maltby, and composer Kenta Nagai. This project was a mobile performance space based in Highland Park in New York City, which lead to a series of performances throughout 2007. The four collaborators on the project worked to express the adaptation and symbiosis processes that occur naturally through these performances.  The Mahomet Aquifer Project  In 2009, after she relocated to Illinois, she created \\"The Mahomet Aquifer Project\\", and worked to integrate the communities of East-Central Illinois that rely on the Mahomet Aquifer. Monson created choreography based on conversations with scientists about people's relationship to water. The movement represents all parts of the aquifer, from location, to history, to economics. With a mobile gallery for viewing, this project also involved images on the geology of the aquifer to enhance the audiences' perspective of the human-to-water relationship. Other people involved in the formation of this project were composer Chris Cogburn, designer Katrin Schnabl, and performers Kyli Klevens, Stephan May, Amy Swanson, and Stephan West. Like \\"BIRD BRAIN\\", this project also utilized panel discussion about the project and its goals.  SIP/Watershed  \\"SIP/Watershed\\" was created in October 2010, alongside Chris Cogburn, Katrin Schnabl, Kate Cahill and Maggie Bennett. \\"SIP\\", standing for \\"sustained immersive process\\", was choreographed based on the water near New York City. With performances spaces on Governors Island, under the Manhattan Bridge, the Nature Walk at Newtown Creek Sewage Plant, 59th Street at 12th Avenue, and 164th Street at the Hudson River, the research for this project was extensive. The group of collaborators took trips to the Hudson River in the Adirondack Mountains, the Catskill Mountains near the Ashokan Reservoir, and New York City's outer edge by the water in order to gain knowledge and inspiration.  iLAND  Created in 2005, iLAND has been doing more than just dance performances. The organization researches in art and science for each project, in order to promote people's understanding fo nature and the environment around them. iLAND has also created the iLAB residency program, the iLAND Symposium, and iLANDing. The iLAB residency program was created in 2006, and is open to dancers, visual artists and natural and social scientists of all kinds. The goal is to provide opportunities for these people to engage with the environment around New York City. iLAB strives the re-imagine the relationships between people and the environment in urban areas specifically, and support the engagement through the disciplines of dance and art. The iLAND Symposium is a way to provide information about the urban environment through panels, presentations, workshops, performances, and more. Since, 2009, there have been about seven major projects created through it. Lastly, A Field Guide to iLANDing, is a book, published in 2017, including scores and methodologies used by the collaborators on the projects produced by the organization.

It encourages the posting of content that was created by and features black creators. Specific tags (e.g. #TheBlackout and #BlackoutDay2020) are used to connect users to that content and to increase the visibility of that content. Blackout Day launched on March 6, 2015, and after December 21, 2015, is scheduled to be held on the seventh day of every third month, starting with March 6, 2016. Blackout Day 2020 has received widespread attention as a result of the killing of George Floyd, the shooting of Breonna Taylor, the death of Elijah McClain, and other victims of police brutality. The last Blackout Day event was July 7, 2020.  Background  The event was conceived in early February 2015 by Tumblr user T'von Green. Green noticed that there was a lack of black representation on social media, specifically on Tumblr; > \\"Damn, I'm not seeing enough Black people on my dash. Of course I see a > constant amount of Black celebrities but what about the regular people? > Where is their shine\\". In addition, he noticed that when Black people were depicted, it was usually in a negative light. Research has shown that Black images in the media adversely affect how members of the Black community view themselves. These harmful images are not only seen by the Black community, but by everyone who has access to a media outlet. Although images of Black people have increased in mass media, those images have been disproportionally harmful due to their violent and crime related content. Generally, if Black people are not being depicted as criminals, they are represented as entertainers such as athletes or musicians. Having these two polar identities of a lawless individual and highly adored star leaves a spectrum of people in the Black community unrepresented. While associating Blacks with athleticism is not harmful in itself, it becomes harmful when that is one of the only things Blacks are associated with. This reality led to an ethical need for positive and relatable images of the black community on platforms like social media. Concerned about these issues, Green decided to gain feedback on his idea by going on Tumblr and through those interactions he met Marissa Sebastian, who came up with the name behind the movement and later on became the PR and CEO of the movement, and Tumblr user V. Matthew-King Yarde (known as Nukrik on social media), the creator behind the various logos for the event. Blackout Day was created as a 24-hour event that would expose the online Black community and others on social media to positive images of everyday beautiful Black individuals, through selfies, videos, gifs and other media. Its goal was to shed a positive light on Black individuals and cripple stereotypes. The idea spread quickly once given a name, and gained supporters within the Black Tumblr community. An official website was created to help the online black community access up to date information on when and how it would work. Before the event, the creators posted guidelines on who could participate and how to do so. After the event launched, the creators decided to make it a monthly event, on every first Friday of every month, but the frequency was an issue for a majority of supporters who believed that the event would not have a significant impact if it was too frequent and they felt as though it should be a yearly event on the day it was first launched, which was an issue for the creators and also other supporters who thought the frequency should be increased. They changed it to a seasonal themed event that would occur on the 21st of September and December until January 2016, when it would be changed to fall on the 6th of every third month. Each Blackout Day would be themed around black heritage/history and participants are encouraged to post content surrounding the given theme.  Guidelines  The guidelines to Whiteout are as follows: * If you identify as Black, either from Africa or from within the African Diaspora, mixed (or part) Black, you can post a picture of yourself for others to admire and re-blog/re-tweet/re-post * You'll tag or mention #Blackoutday or #TheBlackout for it to count * You'll scroll through the tag and re-blog, re-tweet or re-post other photos within that tag to help support * If you are not Black/non-Black or White, you're just re-blogging what's in the tags to show your support * Look for people with low notes and show them some love as well. Official hashtags used are #TheBlackout and #BlackoutDay.  Reception  According to Twitter analytic service Topsy, the hashtag #BlackOutDay was one of the top trending hashtags on Twitter in the United States, with over 58,000 tweets by noon and was a trending topic on Facebook. The creators received national attention for their creative digital activism and used this attention as leverage to start a dialogue about race and the portrayal of black people in the media in and out of social media. Outside of social media they seek to keep the dialogues open through partnerships and have collaborated with Book Riot, and extended the partnership by sponsoring 22 black avid readers and writers. However, the event did not go without opposition hashtags such as #Whiteout were created as a public objection against the movement. The principle was the same as Blackout, but featured selfies of white people. The creators addressed this issue politely by reiterating their movement's goal. Other minority groups have tried unsuccessfully, to mimic the movement by creating variations that are similar to the original #Blackoutday e.g. #Yellowoutday, #Brownoutday, etc. The creators suggested that they be more original and create tags that were more distinguishable from theirs.

Widespread in east Asia, it lives in China, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, and the Philippines. In some countries it is harvested as a food source. It is medically important as a vector of clonorchiasis, paragonimiasis, metagonimiasis and others. Taxonomy The type specimens were collected by American scientist William Stimpson during the North Pacific Exploring and Surveying Expedition (1853‚Äì1856). This species was originally described under the name Melania libertina by American malacologist Augustus Addison Gould in 1859. The specific name libertina is from Latin language and means a \\"freedwoman\\". Semisulcospira libertina is the type species of the genus Semisulcospira by subsequent designation. Kuroda (1963) Kuroda T. (1963). A catalogue of the non-marine mollusks of Japan including the Okinawa and Ogasawara Islands. Malacological Society of Japan, Tokyo, 71 pp. and Habe (1965)Habe T. (1965). Gastropoda, in the New Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Fauna of Japan. Hokuryu-Kan Pub. Co., Tokyo, 14-208 pp. considered S libertina a synonym of Semisulcospira bensoni. The \\"S. libertina species complex\\" consist of three species: S. libertina, S. reiniana and S. kurodai, according to Davis (1969). Placement of S. kurodai within this species complex was confirmed by Oniwa and Kimura in 1986.  Distribution  Distribution map of Semisulcospira libertina This species occurs in: * South Korea: continental South Korea and Jeju Island. * Central China: Hubei, East China: Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi, Zhejiang and South China: Guangdong. * Taiwan * widespread in Japan It is the most common freshwater snail in Japan. * This species was also reported from the Philippines. The type locality was listed as \\"Simoda and Ousima\\" by Gould in 1859, that means two localities: Shimoda City in Honshu and Amami ≈åshima in Ryukyu Islands. Davis (1979) identified the presumed type locality Inozawa River, Inozawa Section, Shimoda City, Izu Peninsula, Shizuoka Prefecture, Honshu. (Site 1 in Figure 4.) Miura et al. (2013) studied mitochondrial haplotypes of Semisulcospira libertina from Korea and from Japan. Mixed haplotypes in Korea suggest long-distance palaeo-migration across the Korea Strait from Japan to Korea. Shells of Semisulcospira libertina were also found in the Nojiri-ko Formation at the Lake Nojiri in Central Japan from the age of 27,000 years BP.  Description  The shell has 4‚Äì6 whorls, while the apex of the shell is usually eroded. The spire is long. The aperture is continuous and the apertural lip is simple. Umbilicus is closed. The shell of Semisulcospira libertina is very variable. There are seven or more (up to 12) basal cords (spiral sculptures at the base of the body whorl). There are sometimes transverse ribs present on the shell sculpture: 12‚Äì18 ribs per penultimate whorl. Periostracum is smooth. The color of the shell is usually light yellow, but it can be light brown very rarely. The spire is darker yellowish-brown. Number of shells is banded with purple brown spiral bands, either with one band, two bands, or three bands. The average width of the shell of Semisulcospira libertina is ‚Äì . The average height of the shell is ‚Äì in Japan. In Korea, the average width of the shell of Semisulcospira libertina is 12.55‚Äì19.37 mm. Chang Y. J., Chang H. J. & Kim J. J.

The average weight of the shell is 0.16‚Äì0.62 g. The average weight of the meat is 0.09‚Äì0.39 g. The extrema dimensions were measured in another locality in Korea: The total wet weight ranges from 0.30 g (shell height 9.87 mm) to 1.55 g (shell height 22.57 mm). Mineral composition of the shell of this species is as follows: 52.9% CaO, 0.77% SiO2, 0.36% Na2O, 0.06% Al2O3, 0.05% Fe2O3, 0.01% MgO and 0.01% P2O5.

Chemoautotrophic bacteria are probable food source of Semisulcospira libertina, because Œ¥13C and Œ¥34S values were lower than in other invertebrates on the site. There are 0.032 mg/g of carotenoids in the body of Semisulcospira libertina (shell exclude). Carotenoids composition include: Œ≤-Carotene 45%, lutein 13%, zeaxanthin 12%, canthaxanthin 6.5%, (3S,3'S)-astaxanthin 6.5%, (3S)-adonirubin, echinenone 3%, Œ±-Carotene 2%, (3S,3'R)-adonixanthin 1%, fritschiellaxanthin 0.5%, traces of diatoxanthin, fucoxanthin, fucoxanthinol, and other carotenoids 4.5%. Beta-carotene is probably originated from green algae and from cyanobacteria. Lutein is from green algae. Zeaxanthin is from cyanobacteria. Other non-trace carotenoids are probably their oxidative metabolites.  Life cycle  Semisulcospira libertina can have hundreds of embryos. Semisulcospira libertina is gonochoristic, which means that each individual animal is distinctly male or female. Semisulcospira libertina is ovoviviparous. The whole larval development occur in the brood pouch of the female. Egg develops into the trochophore, preveliger, veliger, and to the juvenile. There is much of yolk in the embryo.Nakano D.

He was first elected on 28 April 2012 and re-elected on both 19 March 2016 and 28 March 2020 with more than two thirds of the preferential vote.{{Cite weburl=https://prodresults.elections.qld.gov.au/lga2020/029/mayortitle=2020 Gold Coast City Council - Mayoral Election The Gold Coast mayor is directly elected by residents and is the only councillor who doesn't represent a specific Gold Coast Council division; and is the principal representative of the City of Gold Coast and its policies. Gold Coast City has a budget of $1.7 billion annually, the second-highest of any municipal government in Australia, and is the second-largest local government area in Australia, employing a staff of over 3,500.  Personal life  Tom Tate was born in 1959 in Vientiane, Laos, to a Thai mother and an Australian father. His father, Warwick, was an engineer who met Tate's mother, Prapai, when building an airport for the Americans in Thailand. At 11 months of age, Tate's mother took him to Thailand and falsely claimed it was a home birth in order to gain Thai- born citizenship. His parents separated when his father moved back to Sydney from Thailand in 1970, and Tate joined him a year later. Tate attended school at Scots College in Sydney where he was a drummer in the school's pipe band. A qualified civil engineer, Tate graduated from the University of NSW in the early 1980s. He started his career in the construction industry, but transitioned into tourism and hospitality when he moved to the Gold Coast to manage his family's Queensland properties, including the Park Regis at Southport. Tate has been married to his wife, Ruth, for 39 years, and they have four children. His father died on 19 January 2015 after a long illness, and his funeral service was held at the Scots College Chapel in Sydney. Tate is bilingual and speaks two languages fluently ‚Äì English and Thai ‚Äì with limited elementary proficiency in Laotian.  Business career  Tate worked across the world before joining his father's development company at the age of 35. In 1992, Tate Sr bought the Islander Resort Hotel in Surfers Paradise, where Tate managed the refitting of the building. In 1993, he took over management of the Islander and turned it into one of the city's most successful resorts . Notably, during the Asian economic downturn in the late 1990s, he offered hotel rooms for $2/night, leading to the 1999 'off-peak price war'. In 2012 he sold the Islander Hotel Resort for $26.5 million.  Political career  Tate was elected mayor in 2012 as an independent, after the previous incumbent, Ron Clarke, resigned in February 2012, having announced his nomination as an independent candidate for the seat of Broadwater in the 2012 Queensland state election. Tate had two previous attempts at the mayoralty before his successful attempt, including as an endorsed Liberal candidate in 2008. His re-election saw a significant increase in his primary vote, from 37% in 2012 to 63.86% in 2016. On the 28th of March 2020, Tate won a 3rd term as mayor, receiving 55.73% of first preference votes and 66.93% after the distribution of preferences. He is noted for his claim that he does not accept political donations and self-funds his campaigns.  CCC investigation  In September 2017, Tate was the main focus an ABC Four Corners investigation and resultant program titled All That Glitters. The report was compiled and presented by Walkley Award Winning ABC journalist Mark Willacy and looked into claims that Mayor Tom Tate had possibly acted inappropriately in his role as mayor. After the program aired Tate filed legal action against the ABC as well as a separate claim against a fellow City of Gold Coast Councillor, Peter Young from Division 5. In the lawsuit, Mayor Tate claims that he had been defamed by the reporter and by his fellow councillor. On March 2, 2018, Queensland's Crime and Corruption Commission, the state's government authority for investigating official corruption in all tiers of government and public services, announced it would be investigating Mayor Tom Tate as part of a broader investigation into City of Gold Coast Councillors on matters relating to decision-making by some sitting councillors. In May 2018, The Crime and Corruption Commission announced it would be widening its investigation into Tate after further unsubstantiated allegations of official misconduct were received. In April 2019, almost two years on, Tate was cleared over corruption concerns.  References  External links  * City of Gold Coast profile of Tate.

Life  Georg Czarth was born in Vysok√°. He received his first musical instruction from his father, Lukas Lorenz, cantor in Havl√≠ƒçk≈Øv Brod and teacher of Johann Stamitz. After attending school in Vysok√°, Czarth furthered his musical education in Prague and then, at the age of 17, in Vienna. In Vienna he received violin instruction from the Royal Court musicians Franz Josef Timmer and Johann Otto Rosetter (1690‚Äì1752); and from Biarelli he learned the flute. In Vienna he also met the violinist Franz Benda and in 1729 the two musicians left Vienna. After being joined in Breslau (today Wroc≈Çaw) by the violinist Carl H√∂ckh and the hornist Wilhelm Weidner they searched for better employment opportunities in Poland. In Warsaw, Czarth and the three other musicians were taken into the employment of the Starosta Jan Suchorzewski and formed part of a small orchestra of around nine musicians.Douglas A. Lee, A Musician at Court: An Autobiography of Franz Benda, Harmonie Park Press, Warren, Michigan, 1998, p. 19-20 After the departure of Benda in 1732, Czarth became the concertmaster of Suchorzewski's orchestra, but later that year followed Benda into the Royal Polish Chapel at the Saxon Court in Warsaw. In 1734, following the death of August II and the dissolution of the Polish Chapel, Czarth and Benda entered into the service of the crown prince Friedrich of Prussia in Ruppin and a year later in Rheinsberg. Upon the ascent of Friedrich to the throne of Prussia in 1740, the two musicians were transferred to Berlin, where they were employed in the newly founded Court Orchestra. In 1758 the careers of Czarth and Benda diverged when Czarth left Berlin for a position in the Mannheim Court Orchestra. During his time there he was mentioned in the travel diary of Leopold Mozart after a meeting between the two.Leopold Mozart Reiseaufzeichnungen von 1763 bis 1771 Czarth remained in this position until 1778 when the Court orchestra was moved to Munich. Czarth stayed in Mannheim and died shortly after, although the exact date of his death is unknown. An official Mannheim Court document gives his death year as 1780.  Works  Most of Czarth's works were composed during his time in Berlin and are highly representative of the Empfindsamer Stil.

Yang, R. Sampson, S. Wei, T. F. Wenisch, and C. Chakrabarti, \\"Separable Beamforming for 3D Medical Ultrasound Imaging,\\" IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, vol. 63, no. 2, pp. 279-290, 2015. Synthetic Aperture Ultrasound (SAU) Imaging is an advanced form of imaging technology used to form high-resolution images in biomedical ultrasound systems. Ultrasound Imaging has become an important and popular medical imaging method, as it is safer and more economical than computer tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Compared with the conventional ultrasound image formation where one transducer or linear array is used, SAU imaging has achieved higher lateral resolution and deeper penetration, which will enable a more accurate diagnosis in medical applications, with no obvious loss in frame rate and without a large burden in computational complexities.J. A. Jensen, S. I. Nikolov, K. L. Gammelmark, and M. H. Pedersen, \\"Synthetic Aperture Ultrasound Imaging,\\" Ultrasonics, vol. 44, pp. e5-e15, 2006. SAU is based on synthetic beamforming and focusing which are processes whereby the pulse-echo responses from individual pairs of elements are synthesized to reconstruct the formation and focusing, relying on the rule of linear super-position. The working principle of a basic SAU imaging system is one that transmits an ultrasound wave by each small group of all array elements in turn, receive a signal using all possible receive array units, and then reconstruct the image by weighted summation of all demodulated received recordings.R. S. Cobbold, Foundations of Biomedical Ultrasound. Oxford University Press on Demand, 2007. The important advantage of SAU is its ability to achieve dynamic focusing at both transmission and reception without repeating the transmission process with all array elements for each focal zone, thus it saves large computational requirements for delay-and-sum beamforming and leaves space for increasing the frame rate. Also the single transmission and receiving requirement for each firing significantly reduces the hardware complexity for system implementations. Motivation and History The basic idea of SAU originated from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and sonar, where the motion of antenna is used over a region around the target to generate a higher resolution image of the object. In 1972, Burckhardt first put forward the idea that uses synthetic aperture sonar in medical applications and proved that a synthetic aperture system gives a significantly higher lateral resolution than a conventional B-scan.C. B. Burckhardt, P.A. Grandchamp, and H. Hoffmann, \\"An Experimental 2Mhz Synthetic Aperture Sonar System Intended for Medical Use,\\" IEEE Transactions on Sonics and Ultrasonics, vol. 21, no. 1, pp. 1-6, 1974. In 1980, Corl proposed a real-time system implementation for synthetic aperture in medical use.P. Corl and G. Kino, \\"A Real-time Synthetic Aperture Imaging System,\\" in Acoustical Imaging. Springer, 1980, pp. 341-355. However, at that time, SAU implementations were restricted due to the lack of powerful computational machines at a reasonable cost and size. It was during the 1990s that the development of SAU imaging really began to take off due to the availability of fast computers.M. Karaman, P.C. Li, and M. O'Donnell, \\"Synthetic Aperture Imaging for Small Scale Systems,\\" IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control, vol. 42, no. 3, pp. 429-442, 1995.C. Cooley and B. Robinson, \\"Synthetic Focus Imaging Using Partial Datasets,\\" in IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium., vol. 3, 1994, pp. 1539-1542.G. Lockwood and F. S. Foster, \\"Design of Sparse Array Imaging Systems,\\" in IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium, vol. 2, 1995, pp. 1237-1243. Imaging Theory=Theory One typical implementation of the SAU is the one proposed by Jensen.S. Nikolov and J. A. Jensen, \\"Comparison Between Different Encoding Schemes for Synthetic Aperture Imaging,\\" in Medical Imaging. International Society for Optics and Photonics, 2002, pp. 1-12. In his model, only one array element in the transducer is used each time to emit a nearly spherical wave that will cover the whole region of interest. All elements are used to receive the back-scattered signal at the same time, obtaining a low-resolution for each firing. The back-scattered signal contains information required to form the image in all directions and the specific direction can be acquired by applying different delays to signals received by different elements, thus this process works as dynamic focusing at the receiver. By summing all the low-resolution images acquired each time with a determined weight, the final high resolution image is formed and dynamic focusing at transmission is synthesized. Equations Representations Assuming the th focal line in the low-resolution image acquired from the th element's firing is represented as: : L_l (t; i) = \\\\sum^N_{j=1} a_l (j) r[t - \\\\tau_l(t; i, j)] Here, a_l (j) represents the th receive element's apodization factor. r(t) represents the received signal and \\\\tau_l (t; i, j) represents the delay applied to the th receive element when the element receives signal transmitted from th element, to beamform at a specific direction. So the low resolution image can be represented by : \\\\mathbf{L}(t; i) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} L_1 (t_0; i) & L_2 (t_0; i) & .. & L_S (t_0; i) \\\\\\\\\\\\ L_1 (t_1; i) & L_2 (t_1; i) & .. & L_S (t_1; i) \\\\\\\\\\\\ . & . & .. & . \\\\\\\\\\\\ . & . & .. & . \\\\\\\\\\\\ L_1 (t_h; i) & L_2 (t_h; i) & .. & L_S (t_h; i) \\\\end{bmatrix} By summing up all the low-resolution images, the region of interest for the high resolution image can be represented as : \\\\mathbf{H} (t) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\mathbf{L} (t; i) The high resolution image is dynamically focused both at the transmission end and the receive end. Imaging Efficiency The major concern for the medical ultrasound imaging is the frame rate, which is determined by the number of lines that are formed by the focal points required to reconstruct the image, and the pulse repletion frequency. By considering these two parameters, and assuming the depth of the expected image is 150mm and the propagation speed of sound at 1500 m/s, each line will require 200 \\\\mu s to receive the back-scatter information from the farthest focal point. It can be seen that to satisfy the frame with 200 lines each, the frame rate of SAU can achieve a peak at 25 Hz, reflecting the appreciable potential in imaging speed and economy in implementation. Extension Developments=Virtual Sources Focusing Passman and Ermert proposed using transmit focal points as virtual sources and this was further investigated in SAU by later researchers .C. Passmann and H. Ermert, \\"A 100Mhz Ultrasound Imaging System for Dermatologic and Ophthalmologic Diagnostics,\\" IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control, vol. 43, no. 4, pp. 545-552, 1996. This method treats the focus of a transducer as a virtual element besides the actual source points. SAU imaging can be performed without regard to whether or not the element actually exists, after the aperture angle of the transducer was determined. By introducing the virtual sources focusing method, the resolution of imaging and depth of penetration were increased. It was also suggested that the focusing in azimuth and elevation can be treated separately and that the concept of virtual sources focusing SAU can be applied in two planes.S. Nikolov and J. A. Jensen, \\"Virtual Ultrasound Sources in High-resolution Ultrasound Imaging,\\" in Medical Imaging, International Society for Optics and Photonics, 2002, pp. 395-405.C. H. Frazier and W. Brien, \\"Synthetic Aperture Techniques with A Virtual Source Element,\\" IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control, vol. 45, no. 1, pp. 196-207, 1998. Sequential Beamforming Kortbek has put forward a sequential beamforming method to reduce the complexity and improve the simplicity of the hardware implementation. The basic idea is to separate the beamforming process into two-stage procedures by using two independent beamformers. The beamformer in the first stage produces scan lines by using a single focal point in both the transmit and receive processes. The second stage beamformer creates a set of high resolution image points by combining information from multiple focused scan lines acquired in the first stage. For a linear array transducer with multiple elements, the lateral resolution of sequential beamforming SAU can be made more range independent and significantly improved compared to conventional dynamic transmit and receive focusing.J. Kortbek, J. A. Jensen, and K. L. Gammelmark, \\"Synthetic Aperture Sequential Beamforming,\\" in IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium, 2008, pp. 966-969.M. C. Hemmsen, J. M. Hansen, and J. A. Jensen, \\"Synthetic Aperture Sequential Beamformation Applied to Medical Imaging,\\" in 9th European Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar, 2012, pp. 34-37. Bi-directional Pixel-based Focusing The bi-directional pixel-based focusing (BiPBF) method was proposed to solve the problem that SAU imaging suffers from low SNR as the transmission is done by a small part of the array.M.-H. Bae and M.-K. Jeong, \\"Bidirectional Pixel Based Focusing in Conventional B-mode Ultrasound Imaging,\\" Electron Lett, vol. 34, no. 22, pp. 2105-2107, 1998. In BiPBF, the same firing sequence is used in the transmission process as in the traditional array imaging, but the radio frequency (RF) data collected using adjacent groups of array elements are compounded in the receive process. The pixel- based time delays used for compounding are calculated using the distances between pixels and virtual sources located at the successive lateral positions of the transmission focus. Experiments have been done in both phantom and in- vivo experiments; the image quality of the SAU-BiPBF method was considerably improved compared to imaging by conventional dynamic focusing.C. Kim, C. Yoon, J.-H. Park, Y. Lee, W. H. Kim, J. M. Chang, B. I. Choi, T.-K. Song, and Y.-M. Yoo, \\"Evaluation of Ultrasound Synthetic Aperture Imaging Using Bidirectional Pixel-based Focusing: Preliminary Phantom and In-vivo Breast Study,\\" IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, vol. 60, no. 10, pp. 2716-2724, 2013.K.-S. Kim and T. K. Song, \\"High Frame Rate and High Resolution Imaging with Synthetic Aperture,\\" in Key Engineering Materials, vol. 270. Trans Tech Publications, 2004, pp. 168-173. 3D Developments With the development of very large scale integrated circuit technologies, large workload of computations became achievable which made real-time 3D ultrasound imaging possible. Much research showed that 3D imaging which generates volumetric images, will result in better medical interpretations and more accurate diagnosis than the conventional 2D method.S. Campbell, C. Lees, G. Moscoso, and P. Hall, \\"Ultrasound Antenatal Diagnosis of Cleft Palate by A New Technique: the 3D Reverse Faceview,\\" Ultrasound in Obstetrics & Gynecology, vol. 25, no. 1, pp. 12-18, 2005. However, the benefits of 3-D ultrasound imaging come with challenges concerning the computational complexities. 3-D imaging requires a 2-D array transducer in which the number of elements can be ten times more than the linear 1-D array transducer. Moreover, the number of scanlines required in a 3-D volume is at least one order of magnitude higher than in a 2-D image in order to form the volumetric display. To reduce the computational complexities, researchers proposed several methods to support the implementation. To replace the traditional 2-D array, 2-D sparse arrays were put forward to reduce the spatial redundancy.M. Karaman, I. O. Wygant, O. Oralkan, and B. T. Khuri-Yakub, \\"Minimally Redundant 2D Array Designs for 3D Medical Ultrasound Imaging,\\" IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, vol. 28, no. 7, pp. 1051-1061, 2009.B. Diarra, H. Liebgott, M. Robini, P. Tortoli, and C. Cachard, \\"Optimized 2D Array Design for Ultrasound Imaging,\\" in IEEE Proceedings of the 20th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO), 2012, pp. 2718-2722. The method of preliminary beamforming for reconfigurable arrays was proposed to reduce the number of A/D converters and the front-end complexities. To improve the imaging resolution, separable beamforming for SAU 3D imaging was used to decompose the 2D beamforming as a series of 1-D array processing, which was shown to produce images with comparable quality as the non-separable method. A better performance of these methods and devices will be achieved as the technology is improving in terms of higher computation speed and smaller size.

From a deaf woman she met at Calvary, she began learning American Sign Language (ASL) a few signs a week. Later, Riekehof attended ASL courses at Gallaudet College, in 1947-1948 given by Elizabeth Peet. About this time, Riekehof also worked as a secretary for a chemical company for seven years.Entry The Deaf Will Hear, Don Meyer, Mar 2012, at valleyforge.edu; includes a brief CV of Lottie Riekehof Around 1949, she went to the Central Bible College (CBC) to work for her bachelor's degree. She interpreted for deaf students and already taught CBC sign language classes. Her students were preparing to become missionaries, full-time ministers, and interpreters for deaf people in hearing churches. It was the first time and place where sign language was offered for college credit. Riekehof paved the way for interpreting to become a recognized profession by realizing the importance of proper education and training in the field. Starting in 1951, she was the dean of women at CBC for 20 years; she also founded the CBC Deaf Program. She went to New York University, where she obtained her master's degree. After that, she taught sign language there, and worked on her Ph.D. thesis from 1968 to 1970, which was published in 1971. In 1970, Riekehof returned to Gallaudet College to give sign language courses to graduate students preparing for deaf education. Again, these were the first such courses offered for credit, and she volunteered her time freely to teach the classes.She was also teaching as an associate professor in the department of communication arts. She served as dean of women at Gallaudet until 1974, when the college abolished that position. Then, she became the new coordinator for interpreter training for the American Sign Language programs at Gallaudet College.Entry Do You Remember? ~ Dr. Lottie L.

In addition to her many and varied responsibilities at Gallaudet College, she traveled across the globe teaching at workshops and continued providing interpreting services in the Washington D.C. area. She continued her work at Gallaudet College in the communication department until she retired in 1990. Riekehof was a long-time resident of Arlington, Virginia. She died on August 6, 2020, one week short of her 100th birthday. Books Riekehof knew the resources for learning sign language were extremely limited which led her to write her first book in 1961 called American Sign Language. It was published privately by Wayne Shaneyfelt who was a former student of hers. The book was revised in 1963 with a new title, Talk to the Deaf. The new edition of the book included visual illustrations. Riekehof sat down with the artist demonstrating the production of each sign while the artist visually captured the movement of the signs on paper. Countless hours were spent illustrating and designing the book. The signed drawings helped people to learn sign language vocabulary. It was a great resource for parents communicating with their Deaf children, as well as, children or students learning to sign. The book included a wide range of vocabulary, diagrams, how to produce the sign, history of the sign and was categorized into sections making it easy to follow along. The book was picked up by Gospel Publishing House and it became one of their top best sellers. It has sold over 2 million copies. In 1978, an updated version, Talk to the Deaf 2 was written. The name was later changed to The Joy of Signing: The new illustrated guide for mastering sign language and the manual alphabet, and it was dedicated to God. It became used around the world. To her surprise, Riekehof even saw her book being used on television to teach chimpanzees how to sign. The books are currently offered in paperback or hardcover. There has also been a video version made from the books which includes nine hours of footage. Riekehof also created two puzzle books with Linda Lascelle Hillebrand to provide supplemental instruction.

First mined in 1921, the property was later mined by Curtis Sand and Gravel from the early 1960s until 1989, when, as a result of a legal settlement, the Bureau of Land Management put two 10-year leases to mine sand and gravel from the site out to competitive bid. The contracts were awarded to Transit Mixed Concrete, which eventually sold them to Cemex Corporation. mining camp The former operator, Curtis Sand & Gravel, sued in an unsuccessful attempt to overturn the contracts. After Curtis' legal options had been exhausted, the City of Santa Clarita started questioning the validity of Transit Mixed's contracts as part of a public relations campaign to cause the mining contracts to be cancelled. The BLM approved the project in 2000 by issuing a Record of Decision after a review process which lasted over 10 years. The city challenged the approval in court, alleging that the project would spoil air quality, increase traffic on the 14 Freeway and town roads and would threaten endangered fish and wildlife species. Eventually, Cemex, with the United States (Bureau of Land Management) intervening, successfully sued the County of Los Angeles for unreasonable delays. The result was a \\"consent decree\\" or settlement enjoining the county from further interference, and requiring the county to issue a permit and certify the EIR for the federally-approved project in 2004. A 2008 United States District Court decision awarded Cemex attorney fees of $524,476.60 from the City of Santa Clarita. In the decision, Judge A. Howard Matz responded to the City's claim that its action against decertifying the CEQA decision on the Soledad Canyon Sand and Gravel Mining Project constituted \\"a CEQA Action (sic) as permitted under California law\\" by pointing out that \\"every party seeking to enforce CEQA or any comparable environmental statute - - indeed, all statutes, even anti-discrimination laws - - has the duty to comply with applicable professional and judicial requirements.

The first Bill, sponsored in the Senate by Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and co-sponsored by Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) is S.771, the Soledad Canyon Settlement Act from 2013. S.771 and a subsequent piece of legislation sought to engage Congress to direct the Bureau of Land Management to sell vacant land in the desert near Victorville, California, the proceeds of which would go to Cemex Corporation to buy out their interest in mining Soledad Canyon. A subsequent bill (S. 2938http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113s2938is/content- detail.html), with its House version successfully passed, was held up in the Senate for environmental reasons by Martin Heinrich, Democratic senator from New Mexico.http://scvnews.com/2014/12/15/holdout-senator-says-cemex-bill-sets- bad-precedent/ Heinrich objected to selling public lands as a budget offset to pay for the buyout of the mining contracts. On August 28, 2015 the BLM issued a cancellation of the contracts,https://www.scribd.com/doc/290759194/BLM- Decision-To-Rescind-Mining-Contracts-In-Soledad-Canyon-8-15-15 and the decision is currently being appealed by CEMEX. Cemex also filed a petition for stay which along with the Notice of Appeal, is to be heard in an administrative capacity by the Interior Board of Land Appeals. Congressman Steve Knight (politician) (who replaced Buck McKeon as representative of California's 25th District in 2014) \\"welcomed an announcement by Cemex that [the BLM] will cancel their mining contracts in the Santa Clarita Valley\\".

Lori Erica Kennedy Ruff (October 16, 1968 ‚Äì December 24, 2010), was an identity thief who remained unidentified for nearly six years after her death. She was eventually identified as a native of suburban Philadelphia who left home at age 17, in the fall of 1986, because she did not get along with her mother and stepfather. Within the next two years, she obtained the birth certificate of Becky Sue Turner, a 2-year-old girl who had died with her two sisters in a house fire in 1971. McLean used the child's birth certificate to obtain an Idaho state identification card, then moved to Texas and had her name legally changed to Lori Erica Kennedy. Kennedy gradually acquired more documents in her new name, including a Social Security number. After earning a GED and a college degree, she married into a wealthy East Texas family and gave birth to a daughter. Due to her off- putting, secretive behavior, she clashed with her husband's family, and her marriage eventually collapsed. She committed suicide in the driveway of her former in-laws' home in Longview, Texas, on Christmas Eve 2010. After her death, her husband and his family found the evidence of her falsified identity in a lock box in her closet. A 2013 Seattle Times feature article about the case was published in news outlets around the world and created enormous interest in the online \\"websleuth\\" community. McLean's true origins remained a mystery until 2016, when her identity was confirmed using a combination of public records and direct-to-consumer autosomal SNP analysis of her husband's and daughter's DNA, leading back to the McLean‚ÄìCassidy family on Philadelphia's Main Line.  Activities before marriage  In May 1988, McLean obtained the birth certificate of Becky Sue Turner, a 2-year-old girl who was killed, with two of her siblings, in a house fire in Fife, Washington in 1971. McLean requested the birth certificate in Bakersfield, California, Becky Sue Turner's birthplace. She then traveled to Idaho, where she used the document to obtain a state ID card on June 16. McLean, posing as Becky Sue Turner, then appeared before a judge in Dallas July 5, 1988, and legally changed her name to Lori Erica Kennedy. A week later, she obtained a Social Security number, removing traces of her true identity. She also took a birth date of July 18, 1969. She received a Texas driver license in 1989 and qualified for a GED the following year. She enrolled in Dallas County Community College, and in 1997 she graduated from the University of Texas at Arlington with a degree in business administration.  Marriage  In 2003 McLean met Jon Blakely \\"Blake\\" Ruff, the son of a socially prominent family in East Texas, in a Bible study class. Ruff describes her as being incredibly secretive, particularly regarding her past. She had told him she was from Arizona, that both her parents were dead, that she'd had an unhappy childhood, and that she had no siblings; she also said her father was a failed stockbroker. The couple eloped in January 2004 after Nancy Ruff, Blake's mother, had inquired about placing a wedding announcement in the local newspaper. The only person in attendance at their wedding ceremony, held in a church outside Dallas, was the officiating preacher. After getting married, the Ruffs moved to Leonard, Texas. They tried several times to have a child, but had trouble conceiving and suffered multiple miscarriages. This led investigators to believe that Ruff was older than she claimed, though the difference turned out to be less than a year. She eventually gave birth to a baby girl via In vitro fertilisation in 2008.  Divorce and suicide = Marriage breakdown  Ruff was \\"extremely protective\\" of her daughter, often refusing to let anyone else hold her and even taking the baby with her to use the restroom. She would also obsessively track the Ruffs' family history and try to find out their family recipes, but she still refused to talk about her own past. Eventually, Ruff did not want her in-laws to have any contact with her daughter; as a result, the Ruffs began encouraging Blake to get out of the marriage. After some failed marriage therapy sessions, Blake Ruff moved back to his parents' house in Longview and filed for divorce, leaving Lori with their daughter in Leonard.  Suicide  In the months between the separation and Lori's suicide, she behaved very erratically. A neighbor recalled that she and her daughter appeared to be undernourished and that Lori would often ramble incoherently to herself while pacing back and forth outside. She also began sending harassing emails to the Ruffs, created a scene at a custody exchange, and stole a set of house keys from them. The harassment was so severe that the Ruffs filed a cease and desist order just before Lori's death. On December 24, 2010, Ruff's body was discovered in her car in the Ruffs' driveway, dead from a self-inflicted gunshot. In the car were two suicide notes: One 11‚Äëpage note addressed to \\"my wonderful husband\\" and another addressed to her daughter, to be opened on her 18th birthday. The Ruffs opened and read the letter, but it contained only \\"ramblings from a clearly disturbed person\\" and no details about Lori's past.  Investigation = Discovery of past  After Lori's funeral, some of the Ruffs drove to Leonard to see if they could find out more about her in her house. The house was discovered in disarray, with piles of dirty dishes, laundry, and trash stacked up around the house, as well as shredded documents and papers with incoherent scribblings on them. They then discovered the lock box in a closet, pried it open with a screwdriver, and discovered the documentation of Ruff's past. Also found in the lock box was a paper with several seemingly random scribblings. The suicide notes were quickly determined to be incoherent ramblings that offered no clues to Ruff's identity. Other papers included the birth certificate of Becky Sue Turner and a judge's ruling granting a name change to Lori Erica Kennedy. A friend of the family verified that Becky Sue Turner had died in a house fire at the age of 2. The writings on the paper found in the lock box included the scribblings \\"North Hollywood police,\\" \\"402 months,\\" and \\"Ben Perkins.\\" The nature of these scribblings led some followers of the case to believe that Ruff was trying to avoid prison time, due to the references to police, a possible jail-term length, and the name of Ben Perkins, a Los Angeles attorney. When contacted, however, Perkins stated that he had never heard of Becky Sue Turner or Lori Kennedy. (Perkins, who was black and who marketed his legal services to LA's African-American community, had never taken on a white client during his career.) In addition, there were no matches for the woman in any existing fingerprint and facial recognition databases. The fact that Ruff was able to cover up her identity so well in a time before the Internet has led to speculation that she had enlisted the services of a so-called identity broker. In September 2011 the Ruff family, with the help of a congressional aide, sought the help of Joe Velling, an investigator for the Social Security Administration (SSA). Velling agreed to help identify her as a case of identify theft. After following numerous leads he was stumped, and sought the help of the general public to identify her through an article published June 22, 2013, in The Seattle Times. The article was subsequently republished in numerous newspapers around the world.  Identification  School portrait of McLean, circa 1984. Colleen Fitzpatrick, a former nuclear physicist who created the field of forensic genealogy, learned of Lori Ruff in 2013 and began work on the case. Fitzpatrick had Ruff's husband and daughter tested by a direct-to-consumer testing company, through which she was able to obtain Ruff's DNA results using genetic genealogy phasing techniques, which essentially subtracted Blake Ruff's DNA from Lori's. Ruff had a first cousin named Cassidy on her list of matches; however, the name was very common and the cousin was not responsive. After two years, Fitzpatrick finally identified Ruff when she discovered a third cousin match who was related to the Cassidys. Knowing the identity of the third cousin led her to Ruff's identity. Fitzpatrick informed Joe Velling, who had in the meantime retired from the SSA. He flew to Pennsylvania to meet the potential family. Velling approached a relative, who immediately identified the deceased Lori Ruff as Kimberly McLean.  See also  *List of solved missing persons cases *Lyle Stevik, a 2001 suicide in Washington.

Support for the revolt was driven by opposition to the establishment of the French Mandate of Syria. Commonly named after its leading commander, Ibrahim Hananu, the revolt mainly consisted of four allied insurgencies in the areas of Jabal Harim, Jabal Qusayr, Jabal Zawiya and Jabal Sahyun. The rebels were led by rural leaders and mostly engaged in guerrilla attacks against French forces or the sabotage of key infrastructure. The Hananu Revolt coincided with the Alawite Revolt in Syria's coastal mountains led by Saleh al-Ali, and both al-Ali and Hananu jointly referred to their revolts as part of the \\"general national movement of Western Aleppo\\". Despite early rebel victories, guerrilla operations ceased after the French occupation of Aleppo city in July 1920 and the dissolution of the Arab government in Damascus, the revolt's key backer. Hananu's forces renewed the revolt in November 1920 after securing substantial military aid from the Turkish forces of Mustafa Kemal, who were fighting the French for control of southern Anatolia. At the revolt's peak in 1920, Hananu established a quasi-state in the region between Aleppo and the Mediterranean. The rebels were dealt major battlefield defeats in December 1920, and following agreements between the French and the Turks, Turkish military support for the rebels largely dissipated by the spring of 1921. French forces overran Hananu's last stronghold in Jabal Zawiya in July. Hananu was tried by the French Mandatory authorities and was ultimately acquitted. A low-level insurgency led by Yusuf al-Sa'dun persisted, with the last major military engagement with French forces occurring on 8 August 1926. The latter occurred during the countrywide Great Syrian Revolt, which began in the summer of 1925. The collapse of the Hananu Revolt marked a significant turning point in Aleppo's political configurations. Whereas prior to the revolt, many in Aleppo's political elite were aligned with Turkish national politics, the betrayal that Aleppo's leaders felt at the withdrawal of Turkish support prompted most of them to embrace and pursue a shared destiny with the rest of Syria. Many were also influenced by Hananu's support for Syrian unity and strengthening ties with Damascus. In the aftermath of the Franco-Turkish accords, Aleppo's Anatolian hinterland, the major market for its goods and the supplier of its food and raw materials, was ceded to Turkey. This effectively severed commercial relations between Aleppo and Anatolia, harming the former's economy. Background In October 1918, Allied Forces and the Sharifian army wrested control of Syria from the Ottoman Empire. With British military support, the Hashemite leader of the Sharifian army, Emir Faisal, formed a rudimentary government in Damascus which extended its control to the northern inland Syrian cities of Homs, Hama and Aleppo. Meanwhile, France claimed special interests in Syria, per the Sykes-Picot agreement made with the British, and sought to establish a French Mandate over the region. The prospect of French rule was opposed by Syria's inhabitants.Neep 2012, pp. 27‚Äì28. French forces landed in the northern coastal city of Latakia in November 1918 and began to push inland through the coastal mountains, where they faced a revolt led by Saleh al-Ali, an Alawite feudal sheikh.Fieldhouse 2006, p. 283. Political and cultural sentiments in Aleppo Map of the Aleppo Vilayet, an Ottoman province of which Aleppo was the administrative capital. The province's territory was later divided between Syria and Turkey At the time of the Arab Revolt and its aftermath, Aleppo's political elite was divided between those who embraced the Arab nationalist movement led by Faisal and those who sought political autonomy for Aleppo and its hinterland within the Ottoman state. A number of factors distinguished the attitudes of Aleppo's elite and populace from those of Damascus. For one, the economic well-being of Aleppo's inhabitants was dependent on open, commercial access to Aleppo's Anatolian hinterland, which was predominantly populated by Turks; southwestern Anatolia was the principal market for Aleppo's goods and the principal supplier of its food and raw materials.Khoury 1987, p. 103. Furthermore, the political elite of Aleppo, which was considerably more ethnically and religiously diverse than the almost entirely Arab Muslim-populated Damascus, was culturally closer to Turkish-Ottoman society, and numerous members of Aleppo's elite were of Turkic, Kurdish and Circassian descent. Because of these factors, many in Aleppo's political class did not support the 1916 Arab Revolt, and those who joined it felt that the revolt negatively exceeded their expectations because it ultimately ended Ottoman rule, thus breaking the bonds of Islamic unity and initiating the separation of Aleppo from its Anatolian hinterland.Khoury 1987, p. 104. There was also resentment in Aleppo, which under Ottoman rule had been the administrative center of the Aleppo Vilayet (Province of Aleppo) and was equal to Damascus in political stature, at the political dominance of Damascus under Faisal. While there were several Aleppines who held influential positions in Faisal's Damascus-based government, Faisal's leading political authorities in Aleppo were from Damascus or Iraq. However, French officials incorrectly believed that the rivalry between Aleppo and Damascus would make Aleppo's elite embrace French rule. Instead, according to historian Phillip S. Khoury, Aleppo \\"vigorously resisted [French] occupation in order that its voice be heard in the new political climate.\\" Several Aleppan dignitaries supported Emir Faisal and in late October 1918, following the Sharifian army's entry into Aleppo, a branch of the Arab Club was founded in the city.Gelvin 1999, p. 84. The Arab Club's ideology was a mix of Arab nationalism and Aleppine regionalism.Khoury 1987, p. 106. It promoted the concept of Syrian national unity, and served as a political support base for Emir Faisal. Among the Arab Club's founders were Ibrahim Hananu, the president of Aleppo Vilayet's presidential council, Rashid al-Tali'a, governor of Aleppo Vilayet, Najib Bani Zadih, a wealthy Aleppine merchant, Abd al-Rahman al-Kayyali, an Aleppine physician and Shaykh Mas'ud al-Kawakibi, one of the city's leading Muslim scholars. Prelude and early rebel actions Ibrahim Hananu, a principal leader of the revolt, 1932 In November 1918, soldiers from Emir Faisal's army entered Antioch and were welcomed by the city's Arab inhabitants. In late November, French troops landed on the coast of the Gulf of Alexandretta and entered the city of Alexandretta, prompting anti-French uprisings in Antioch, al-Hamammat and Qirqkhan and the al-Amuq area. In December, French troops occupied Antioch and replaced the Arab flag on its governmental headquarters with the French flag. The revolts continued in the city's countryside, namely in the vicinity of Harbiya and al-Qusayr. The local uprisings spread from the Antioch region to Aleppo's countryside as far as the Euphrates.Arsuzi, ed. Sluglett and Weber 2010, pp. 586‚Äì587. The rebels consisted of small, disorganized ‚Ä≤i·π£ƒÅbƒÅt (bands) and launched guerrilla-style attacks against French targets, but they also engaged in banditry and highway robberies.Neep 2012, pp. 109‚Äì110. An early attempt to coordinate the various rebel groups took place when one of the leaders of the Antiochian uprising and Alawite notable, Najib al-Arsuzi, developed contacts with rebel leaders from Jisr al-Shughur and other areas. British forces withdrew from Syria to Transjordan and Palestine in December 1919 as part of agreements with France over dividing control of the Ottomans' predominantly Arab territories (later, in April 1920, France was given a mandate over Syria at the San Remo conference).Arsuzi, Ed. Sluglett and Weber 2010, p. 582. This left Faisal's rudimentary state vulnerable to French occupation. The French demanded that Faisal rein in the ‚Ä≤i·π£ƒÅbƒÅt,Arsuzi, ed. Sluglett and Weber 2010, p. 588. which were not under Faisal's control.Arsuzi, ed. Sluglett and Weber, p. 583. Instead, Faisal opted to support and organize the northern rebels to prevent French advances from the coastal areas to the Syrian interior. The Arab government entrusted two natives of northern Syria, Hananu, a former Ottoman military instructor and a municipal official,Watenpaugh 2014, p. 175. and Subhi Barakat, a notable from Alexandretta, with expanding and organizing the local uprisings into a full-blown revolt. Initially, Hananu logistically supported the guerrilla operations of Barakat against the French in the Antioch region. He later decided to organize a rebellion in Aleppo and its countryside.Gelvin 1999, p. 133. Hananu was motivated to act by what he saw as the ineffectiveness of the Syrian National Congress, the legislative body of Faisal's state of which Hananu was a member, in preventing French rule. He may also have been encouraged by Rashid al-Tali'a, the Arab government's district governor of Hama, who had been supporting Saleh al-Ali and the Alawite- dominated revolt he was leading against the French in the Syrian coastal mountains.Gelvin 1999, p. 134. Meanwhile, the Syrian National Congress proclaimed the establishment of the Arab Kingdom of Syria in March 1920. France was wary that a popular nationalist movement emanating from Faisal's kingdom could spread to Lebanon and French territories in North Africa, and moved to put an end to Faisal's state. Anti-French resistance manifested at local level as the Committees of National Defense, which began springing up in Aleppo and its hinterland. The committees were founded by members of the local elite, many of whom were sympathetic to Ottoman rule, but the committees quickly became fueled by populist agitation against French colonialism. Hananu gained the backing of Aleppo's Committee of National Defense, which consisted of numerous educated professionals, wealthy merchants and Muslim religious leaders.Khoury 1987, p. 105. The committee provided him with arms and funds, and helped promote his armed campaign among the city's Muslim scholars as well as put Hananu in touch with Ibrahim al-Shaghuri, head of the Arab Army's Second Division. On orders from the Arab government in Damascus, Hananu formed an ‚Ä≤i·π£ƒÅbƒÅ in Aleppo consisting of seven men from his native Kafr Takharim, who he armed with hand-held bombs and rifles.Arsuzi-Elamir, ed. Sluglett and Weber 2010, p. 588. With al-Shaghuri's assistance, Hananu later expanded his ‚Ä≤i·π£ƒÅbƒÅ to forty fighters, known as mujahidin (fighters of a holy struggle), from Kafr Takharim and organized them into four equal-sized units.Gelvin 1999, pp. 133‚Äì134. According to historian Dalal Arsuzi-Elamir, the small size of each unit made them highly mobile and \\"able to inflict chaos on French troops\\". Hananu used his family's farm in the regional administrative center of Harim as the headquarters of his branch of the Committee of National Defense. Revolt=First phaseBattle of Harim= Hananu's revolt coincided with Turkish revolts against the French military presence in the Anatolian cities of Urfa, Gaziantep and Mar'ash.Watenpaugh 2014, p. 176. It also was related to Barakat's revolt in Antioch, which was captured and held by Arab guerrillas for a week starting on 13 March 1920. The French Air Force bombarded Antioch for 17 days until the rebels withdrew to Narlija. On 18 April, taking advantage of the diversion of French forces to Gaziantep where a major battle between French and Turkish forces was taking place, Hananu decided to attack the French garrison at Harim. With fifty of his irregulars, Hananu stormed the town. As word of his attack spread to nearby villages, his forces subsequently swelled to 400. Hananu and Rashid al-Tali'a cooperated with Barakat in an attempt to unify northern Syria's rebel groups into a single resistance movement against the French, in allegiance with Faisal's government in Damascus.Philipp and Schumann 2004, p. 279. Hananu also formed an alliance with the semi-nomadic Mawali tribesmen of the Aleppo region.Philipp and Schumann 2004, p. 277. Following the battle at Harim, Hananu, with the assistance of Aleppo's Committee of National Defense, had collected up to 2,000 gold pounds in funds, and 1,700 rifles for the 680 men in his 'i·π£ƒÅbƒÅ, who he and his aides trained.Khoury 1987, p. 106. =French occupation of Aleppo= Henri Gouraud passing through the Old City of Aleppo nearly two months after its occupation by French forces in July 1920 In April 1920, Hananu coordinated the shipment of Turkish arms to Saleh al-Ali's forces in their revolt against the French in the coastal mountains south of Latakia.Watenpaugh 2014, p. 178. Faisal's government aided Hananu's movement financially and logistically via local Arab nationalist intermediaries. French General Henri Gouraud demanded that Faisal rein in the rebels of northern Syria and end their resistance to the French military advance. Faisal continued to oppose French rule and his government launched a campaign to conscript soldiers from throughout the country in May as part of a last-ditch effort to defend Damascus against a French invasion, but the recruitment campaign was unsuccessful. On 14 July, Gouraud issued an ultimatum to Faisal to demobilize his makeshift Arab Army and recognize France's mandate over Syria. Later in mid-July, French forces broke Hananu's resistance lines in Jisr al-Shughur, capturing the town on their way to Aleppo. In late July, the French escalated their push into Syria's major inland cities. On 23 July, French troops led by General Fernand Goubeau,Allawi 2014, p. 291. commander of the Army of the Levant's Fourth Division, captured Aleppo without resistance. The lack of resistance was criticized by commander al-Sa'dun in his memoirs. In the aftermath of Aleppo's occupation, he organized 750 rebels to oust the French from the city, a plan that did not materialize.Arsuzi, ed. Sluglett and Weber 2010, p. 589. The consequent flight of Aleppo's Arab nationalist leaders to the countryside and the French forces' military superiority managed to stymie a potential revolt in the city. On 25 July, French forces captured Damascus a day after routing a small Arab Army contingent and armed volunteers led by Yusuf al-'Azma at the Battle of Maysalun. Following the loss of Aleppo and Damascus, Barakat arranged a meeting of Antiochian rebel leaders in al- Qusayr, in which the attendants were divided between those who advocated either of the following: continuing the revolt, surrendering to the French or approaching the Turks for support. After the meeting, Barakat chose to defect to the French. Afterward, al-Sa'dun and his fighters continued the revolt in Barakat's former area of operations.Arsuzi, ed. Sluglett and Weber 2010, pp. 589‚Äì590. Hananu meanwhile left Aleppo, which had served as his urban base, and went to the village of Baruda to regroup and continue the revolt, rallying support around his leadership from the active ‚Ä≤i·π£ƒÅbƒÅt in the western Aleppo countryside.Arsuzi, ed. Sluglett and Weber 2010, p. 590. The revolt subsequently expanded to include four other ‚Ä≤i·π£ƒÅbƒÅt, namely al-Sa'dun's ‚Ä≤i·π£ƒÅbƒÅ (over 400 rebels) in the Jabal Qusayr area near Antioch, Umar al-Bitar's ‚Ä≤i·π£ƒÅbƒÅ (150 rebels) in Jabal Sahyun in the mountains around al-Haffah northeast of Latakia, the ‚Ä≤i·π£ƒÅbƒÅ in Jabal Zawiya (200 rebels) under commander Mustafa al-Hajj Husayn and Najib Uwaid's ‚Ä≤i·π£ƒÅbƒÅ (250 fighters) around Kafr Takharim in Harim District.Choueiri 1993, p. 19. Al-Sa'dun's area of operations were centered in Jabal Qusayr, but extended as far north as al- Amuq, as far south as Jisr al-Shughur, as far east as Darkush and far west as the Kesab area. An ‚Ä≤i·π£ƒÅbƒÅ from Jableh led by Sheikh Izz ad-Din al-Qassam also formed part of the revolt. The French military authorities considered al- Qassam's group, which relocated its headquarters to the Jabal Sahyun village of Zanqufa from Jableh in early 1920,Schleifer, ed. Burke 1993, p. 169. to be a part of al-Bitar's unit, but the two commanders operated in different sectors. Al-Bitar's unit had been active in Jabal Sahyun since early 1919 soon after French forces landed in Latakia. Al-Qassam left Syria to British-held Palestine sometime after the Battle of Maysalun to avoid capture by the French who issued a warrant for his arrest. Second phaseAlliance with Turkish forces= Mustafa Kemal in 1921. Hananu established an alliance with Mustafa Kemal, who supplied Hananu's forces with arms, funds and military advisers With the Arab government in Damascus destroyed and Faisal exiled, Hananu's rebels sought to compensate for the consequent loss of aid from the Arab government. In the period following the Arab defeat, the rebels began appointing administrators in their territory who oversaw the institution of taxes to support the revolt, monthly salaries for the fighters and supply services for the 'i·π£ƒÅbƒÅ. They also sought military training by Turkish officers. Hananu and some of his aides traveled to Mar'ash to request support from the Anatolian insurgents and on 7 September, he signed a deal with them in which they recognized him as the representative of the Arab government of Syria and promised military aid. In the course of that month, Hananu began receiving significant financial and military support, and military advisers, from the remnants of the Ottoman Second Army.Watenpaugh 2014, p. 177. Despite the mutual suspicion between the nationalists in Aleppo and Turkey, who were leading their respective revolts, both sides agreed that they were confronting a common French enemy. In addition, the Turkish struggle to oust French forces from Anatolia was popularly supported by Syria's inhabitants, and in northern Syria in particular, there were widespread feelings of religious solidarity with the Turks. In the second week of September, Saleh al-Ali announced that he was ready to coordinate with Hananu's rebels. The Turkish forces in Anatolia were led by Mustafa Kemal, who Hananu established contact with via intermediaries, chief of whom was Jamil Ibrahim Pasha. The latter, who was an Arabized Kurd, Ottoman World War veteran and absentee landlord from Aleppo, met Mustafa Kemal in Gaziantep in the late summer of 1920. During their meeting, an agreement was concluded to launch a propaganda campaign funded by the Turks against the French occupation. The campaign began in Aleppo in December 1920.Khoury 1987, p. 107. Although an urban revolt in Aleppo did not take place in the aftermath of the city's occupation by French forces, many of Aleppo's inhabitants engaged in passive resistance against the French and clandestinely provided material aid to Hananu's rebels fighting in the rural areas west of the city. In addition to the rebels' propaganda campaign, anti- French sentiment in Aleppo was growing due to socio-economic factors. These included the disruption of trade routes between Aleppo and its countryside, the hoarding and profiteering of flour and rising unemployment that was partially a result of an influx of Armenian refugees who had fled their villages in Turkey during the Armenian Genocide. The latter led to soaring prices for bread and subsequent food riots and famine in some of the city's neighborhoods. The French authorities also declared martial law, restricting travel and speech, further frustrating the inhabitants. As a result of deteriorating conditions in the city attributed to French governance, the unpopular establishment of martial law, and the propaganda efforts of the rebels and their Turkish backers, many neighborhood leaders in Aleppo decided to recruit men to join Hananu's rebels, while many of the city's landowners and merchants donated funds to the rebel cause. The presence of 5,000 French Senegalese troops prevented an urban revolt that specifically targeted French forces, but in numerous incidents, Muslims from Aleppo's lower-income neighborhoods, such as Bab al-Nairab, violently assaulted members of the city's large Christian minority because they were viewed as being associated with French interests.Khoury 1987, p. 108. =Renewal of revolt= After the relative lull in fighting that followed the French occupation of Aleppo and Damascus, Hananu's forces resumed their guerrilla campaign in November 1920.Khoury 1987, p. 108. By then, Hananu's forces grew to about 5,000 irregulars.Moubayed 2006, p. 376. Two months prior to the November offensive, the rebellions in the Antioch area and the Syrian coastal mountains had also resumed after temporarily tapering off in May 1920. Armed action by Hananu's allies included an assault against the police station of Hammam, a village north of Harim, by 600 rebels in September. Gouraud stated in a report on 21 September that the rebels were in full control of Antakya, the road between the latter city and Aleppo and the Amanus Mountains. Hananu's rebels sabotaged telegraph lines and railroads, captured and disarmed French troops, and disrupted French military movements into Aleppo city. The repeated destruction of railroad and telegraph lines between Aleppo, Alexandretta and Beirut by Hananu and Saleh al-Ali's rebels placed the rebels in a position to take full control of northwestern Syria. By the end of November, the rebels gained control of the towns of Harim and Jisr al-Shughur and the villages of their districts. They then prepared for offensives to capture the towns and districts of Idlib and Maarrat al-Nu'man.Khoury 1987, p. 109. Other major scenes of fighting occurred at Isqat, Jisr al-Hadid, Kafr Takharim, Darkush, Talkalakh and the areas of al-Qusayr and Antioch. At around the same time, Kurdish tribal forces countered the French at Viran≈üehir, east of Aleppo, and Bedouin forces commanded by ex-Ottoman officer Ramadan al-Shallash, who declared his support for Hananu, began guerrilla actions against French forces in the general vicinity of Raqqa. In the late winter of 1920, Hananu's rebels assaulted French forces in Idlib and according to the British consul in Aleppo, looted the town and killed some of its Christian inhabitants. Hananu's victory at Idlib and the arrival of Turkish military assistance led to a French withdrawal from Idlib. Hananu's principal lieutenant commander in the Idlib operations was Tahir al-Kayyali,Philipp and Schumann 2004, p. 261. who also served as president of the Arab Club of Aleppo and Aleppo's Committee of National Defense.Gelvin 1999, p. 85. In early December, the French general of the 2nd Division in Aleppo, , assembled a column at Hammam. In mid-December, the French launched a counterattack on Idlib and burned down the city. Afterward, General de Lamothe assembled a second column at Idlib. The French column from Hammam managed to capture Harim and Jisr al-Shughur from the rebels after a series of attacks and counterattacks between the two sides in late December. Hananu's rebels and Turkish irregulars launched a broad offensive to regain their positions in Harim, Jisr al-Shughur and Idlib, and according to Khoury, \\"a reversal seemed possible\\", as a result of the offensive. However, a French relief column arrived in the area and the French consolidated their hold over the three major towns. The French victories in December proved to be a decisive setback for Hananu's forces, who withdrew to Jabal Zawiya, a mountainous area south of Idlib. At Jabal Zawiya, Hananu and his commanders re-organized the rebels into more numerous, smaller units. In early 1921, using al-Shallash as an intermediary, Hananu began receiving support from Emir Abdullah, the Hashemite emir of Transjordan and Faisal's brother.Bidwell 2012, p. 174. Although the support from Emir Abdullah was relatively small in quantity, the French authorities feared it was part of a plot by Abdullah and his British allies to oust the French from Syria. Hananu, meanwhile, was launching frequent hit-and-run operations against the French left flank in the area between Urfa and Antioch in an effort to support the Turks at the main battlefront in Gaziantep. =Dwindling Turkish support= Hananu continued to receive arms and funds from Anatolia in early 1921, including a shipment in March consisting of 30 machine guns and 20 horse-loads of ammunition, which came after a larger weapons shipment via Jarabulus sometime in late February‚Äìearly March. The Turks and the French negotiated a treaty to end fighting in Cilicia, the southern Anatolian region north of Aleppo, in March.Neep 2012, p. 110. That month, Hananu and Saleh al-Ali issued a joint letter to the League of Nations via the US and Spanish consuls in Aleppo in which the rebel leaders referred to themselves as commanders of the \\"general national movement in the region of Western Aleppo\\" and asserted that Syria sought to remain independent of France, and that the country was part of a broader Islamic community associated with the Ottoman state. Despite the treaty with France, Turkish forces in southern Anatolia continued to support Hananu's rebels with arms for a while longer to pressure the French further and gain more leverage in negotiations over territorial concessions. At this point in the revolt, the rebels were in control of the villages of the Harim, Antioch, Jisr al-Shughur, Idlib and Maarrat al-Nu'man districts, but not the towns themselves. The French and Hananu entered into negotiations in the village of Kurin near Idlib in April, but they faltered. By order of the French Mandate's High Commissioner, Henri Gouraud, the French reinforced their military presence in the greater Aleppo region in April, and their columns defeated Hananu's rebels in a number of confrontations during this period. By April, the French had over 20,000 troops in southern Anatolia and northern Syria, with over 5,000 troops in Aleppo, 4,500 in the Idlib district, 1,000 in Qatma and 5,000 in the Antioch region. In May, French troops commanded by General Goubeau pursued Mawali and Sbaa Bedouin rebels after they launched several attacks against the highway between Homs and Hama. The Mawali surrendered after French aerial bombardments against their encampments in Qatara on 21 May.Baxter 2013, p. 80. According to French intelligence reports, the Turks sent political agents to northern Syria to persuade the inhabitants to drop their armed resistance to the French and embrace French rule, which they claimed would benefit the population. Sometime between April and May,Watenpaugh 2014, p. 179. Hananu had Uwaid execute field commander Mustafa Asim Bey for his involvement in an attack against the mostly Christian town of al-Suqaylabiyah, in which many of its inhabitants were killed.Arsuzi-Elamir, ed. Sluglett and Weber 2010, p. 592. Asim Bey was a strongly pro-Ottoman, Arab officer with particularly close connections to the Anatolian insurgency.Watenpaugh 2014, p. 115. Hananu believed that the Turks had instructed him to carry out the raids on al-Suqaylabiyah and other villages to tarnish the image of the rebels among the local inhabitants, as part of Turkey's agreements with France to stifle the revolt in northern Syria. Asim's execution may have contributed to the rapid withdrawal of the rebels' Turkish military advisers who were upset with the execution. The arms flow from Anatolia ended in June, either due to a direct French diplomatic request or the diversion of arms and fighters to combat the Greek offensive against the Turks in western Anatolia. In any case, the stopping of weapons shipments had a significant impact on both the military aspect of the rebellion and morale, as Hananu and the revolt's backers in Aleppo felt abandoned by the Turks, who later concluded a final peace arrangement with France, known as the Treaty of Ankara, in October.Watenpaugh 2014, p. 180. In need of funds, Hananu hired local bandits to extort money and supplies from Jabal Zawiya's inhabitants.Khoury 1987, pp. 109‚Äì110. His main sources of weapons became limited to the towns of Maarrat al-Nu'man and Hama.Khoury 1987, p. 110. With the previous blows dealt to the rebels by French forces, the waning support for the revolt by the local inhabitants and the lack of weapons, Hananu's revolt largely dissipated during the spring of 1921, although rebel operations against the French still continued at a reduced pace during this period. Suppression and aftermath Attorney Fathallah Saqqal defended Hananu in court in March 1922 and succeeded in having Hananu acquitted of all charges Between the spring and early summer of 1921, the rebels experienced a series of defeats. In July 1921, Hananu's stronghold in Jabal Zawiya was captured by French forces. By this time, French forces proceeded to burn down villages where support for the rebels was high. A number of these villages' inhabitants were arrested or executed, prompting some rebels to ultimately surrender. On 11 or 12 July, Hananu fled to British-held Transjordan, seeking refuge with nationalists from Syria, to avoid arrest by the French authorities.Watenpaugh 2014, pp. 180‚Äì181. British intelligence officers arrested Hananu while he was visiting Jerusalem and extradited him to Syria in August. After six months of incarceration, Hananu was subsequently put on trial on 15 March 1922, with the charges against him including murder, organizing rebel bands, engaging in brigandage and the destruction of public property and infrastructure. He was defended by the Aleppine Christian attorney, Fathallah Saqqal. In court, Hananu condemned the \\"illegal occupation of Syria\\" and argued that military operations were done under the aegis of Mustafa Kemal. The trial became a rallying point of popular support for Hananu and a led to a significant degree of solidarity among Aleppo's urban elite who collectively supported Hananu's freedom. The trial concluded on 18 March, and Hananu was acquitted after the court decided that he was not a rebel, but rather a soldier who was legally mandated by the Ottoman authorities to engage in warfare against French forces. According to Khoury, the \\"verdict would have been different ... had Hananu not become a legend in his own time\\" and if the Franco-Turkish War had not ended. Although Hananu's revolt was largely suppressed, a low-level insurgency involving small ‚Ä≤i·π£ƒÅbƒÅt persisted in Aleppo's countryside. Al- Sa'dun and Uwaid opted to continue the armed struggle, fleeing to the coastal mountains and from there to Turkey in December 1921. From the frontier area with Syria, they staged hit-and-run attacks against French forces. With 100 of his fighters, al-Sa'dun entered Jabal Zawiya in the summer of 1922 to punish those who defected from the rebels or residents who switched allegiance. On 26 August, al-Sa'dun's ‚Ä≤i·π£ƒÅbƒÅ assaulted a postal convoy in al-Darakiya, a village between Darkush and Antioch. In 1923, rebel commander Aqil al-Saqati and ten of his fighters launched numerous attacks against the French, including an assault against a government building in al-Safira, southeast of Aleppo, and Jisr al-Hadid near Antakya. The insurgency in northwestern Syria continued and between December 1925 and August 1926, al-Sa'dun's fighters launched several attacks against French forces and military installments. These attacks coincided with the Great Syrian Revolt that started in the south of the country and spread to central and northern Syrian cities. Among the major engagements between al-Sa'dun's 'i·π£ƒÅbƒÅ and the French was at Tell Amar at the end of April 1926. The last major confrontation was at Jabal Qusayr on 8 August 1926. Rebel organization The rebel groups were collectively known as ·∏•arakat al-‚Ä≤i·π£ƒÅbƒÅt, and each individual ‚Ä≤i·π£ƒÅbƒÅ was composed of anywhere between 30 and 100 rebels known as mujahidin and were led by a ra'ƒ´s (commander), who was often a local notable or the head of a major clan.M√©ouchy, ed. Liebau 2010, p. 504. Individual ‚Ä≤i·π£ƒÅbƒÅt began forming in the countryside between Aleppo and Anatolia in 1919 to counter French advances, but Hananu gradually consolidated them into his network.Neep 2012, p. 35. The revolt was ultimately organized into four principal military zones, each headed by a ra'ƒ´s 'i·π£ƒÅbƒÅ native to the particular zone. The four zones were the following: Jabal Qusayr (Antioch area) headed by Sheikh Yusuf al-Sa'dun (headquarters in Babatorun), Jabal Harim headed by Najib Uwaid (headquarters in Kafr Takharim), Jabal Zawiya headed by Mustafa Haj Husayn and Jabal Sahyun (al-Haffah area) headed by Umar al-Bitar. Hananu, the overall leader of the revolt, and the regional commanders discussed major military decisions, typically involving a particular guerrilla campaign or arms procurement, together. At times they also consulted with Ozdemir Bey, commander of Turkish irregulars fighting the French in Anatolia. At the height of the revolt, Hananu effectively created a quasi-independent state between Aleppo and the Mediterranean Sea. Hananu's rebels first began administering captured territory in Armanaz, where the rebels coordinated with that town's municipality to impose taxes on landowners, livestock owners and farmers to fund their operations. From there, Hananu's administrative territory expanded to other towns and villages, including Kafr Takharim, and the district centers Harim, Jisr al-Shughur and Idlib. The municipal councils of these towns were not replaced, but repurposed to support the financial needs of the rebels and promote their social convictions. Kafr Takharim became the legislative center of rebel territory with a legislative committee in place to collect money and weapons from local sources, and a supreme revolutionary council to oversee judicial matters. Volunteers from the rural villages formed the bulk of the rebels' fighting force and during the course of the revolt, each village typically contained a 30-man reserve unit. However, Hananu's forces also included volunteers from Aleppo city, former Ottoman conscripts, Bedouin tribesmen (including some 1,500 Mawali fighters) and Turkish officers who served as advisers. The ‚Ä≤i·π£ƒÅbƒÅt were rooted in the rural countryside, but also drew financial support from people in the cities.Philipp and Schumann 2004, p. 278. While the rebels functioned as a traditional rural Syrian autonomous movement wary of centralized authority or foreign intervention into their affairs, they also sought to establish close ties with the Arab nationalist movement and, until the Arab Army's defeat at Maysalun, with representatives of the Arab government based in the cities.M√©ouchy, ed. Liebau 2010, p. 510. Besides military expertise, formal military language and style was important to rebel commanders as they sought to instill in their soldiers the \\"spirit, self-image and shape of an army\\", according to historian Nadine M√©ouchy.M√©ouchy, ed. Liebau 2010, p. 512. During meetings of the rebel leadership, the mujahidin of the host leader assumed military formation by lining up along the road of the host village and saluting the visiting commanders. The rebels referred to themselves as jun≈´d al-thawra (sing. jundi), meaning \\"soldiers of revolt\\", which represented a more noble image than the term i·π£ƒÅbƒÅ, which was associated with banditry, and the term al- askar, which referred to the military and had negative connotations due to its association with conscription and repression. Each mujahid received a salary depending on his rank, with cavalrymen (fursan) or officers receiving higher pay than foot soldiers (mushƒÅt).M√©ouchy, ed. Liebau 2010, pp. 511‚Äì512. The rebels had multiple sources for arms, but did not possess heavy weaponry,M√©ouchy, ed. Liebau 2010, p. 511. with the exception of two artillery pieces. Sources for weapons included the Turkish forces in southern Anatolia, Bedouin tribes who either sold or smuggled Mauser rifles to the rebels that the Germans had distributed to the tribes during World War I, weapon stockpiles left behind by Ottoman troops fleeing Syria during the British-Arab offensive in 1918, and raids against French arms warehouses. The rebels' arsenal largely consisted of German Mauser rifles, revolvers, shotguns, and Turkish five-shooters, as well as sabres and daggers. According to Khoury, the rebels also possessed twelve light machine guns. Following the destruction of the Arab government in July 1920, the Turks became the main arms suppliers of the rebels. The rebels distinguished the Turkish armed movement in Anatolia from the Ottomans, who the rebels viewed negatively, by stressing the role of Turkish general Mustafa Kemal, who was viewed as the quintessential guerrilla leader in the struggle against French occupation. Tactics=Rebels The chief operational goals of the ‚Ä≤i·π£ƒÅbƒÅt were to inflict as much damage as they could on French forces and make clear their \\"determination to resist\\", according to Arsuzi. The rebels utilized the familiar, mountainous terrain where they operated against the French forces, and typically launched guerrilla operations at night to avoid detection. However, at times when the rebels could not avoid direct confrontation with French forces, they maintained fighting order similar to a regular army. French forces Militarily, the French utilized large column formations against the rebels, a tactic which the French chief-of-staff of the Army of the Levant, General Andr√©-Gaston Pr√©telat, found to be generally ineffective against small mobile rebel units. Instead, he believed the optimal way to defeat the rebels was to recruit local militias who would share the two main strengths of the rebels: knowledge of the terrain and high mobility. However, the Syrian gendarmerie conscripted by the French military could not defeat the rebels because they were too small numerically, and not entirely reliable in battles against fellow locals. The French were more successful in persuading large landowners to cease support for the rebels and recruit local militias to protect highways from rebel attacks. The French also ultimately understood that in order to quell the revolt in Syria they needed to offer concessions in Anatolia and establish cooperation with the Turks, whose financial, military and moral support was critical to the rebels. When truces were reached with the Turks, the French redeployed large numbers of troops from the Anatolian front to suppress the rebels in Syria.Arsuzi, ed. Sluglett and Weber 2010, pp. 591‚Äì592. Motivations for revolt Umar al-Bitar was the rebel commander of Jabal Sahyun, one of the four rebel military zones of the revolt Hananu's subordinate officers and rank-and-file fighters were all Sunni Muslims, but were ethnically heterogeneous. Hananu himself was a Kurd as were field commanders Najib Uwaid and Abdullah ibn Umar, while Umar al-Bitar was an Arab and field commander Sha'ban Agha was a Turk. The ‚Ä≤isabat led by al-Bitar and al-Qassam were dominated by Arabs.Philipp and Schumann 2004, pp. 260‚Äì261. The localized nature of the revolt reflected the rebels' sense of defending their homeland and community. Despite the eventual organization of the revolt and coordination between rebel commanders for major military decisions, most political decisions and military operations were local initiatives. As such, al-Sa'dun referred to the revolt in the plural as thawrat al-Shimal (Northern revolts) rather than the singular thawra, and referred to the leadership of the revolt as the plural quwwad al-thawra rather than qiyadat al-thawra, which refers to a central command. The rebels of the Hananu Revolt were motivated by three principal factors: defense of the homeland, which the rebels referred to as al-bilad or al-watan, defense of Islam in the face of conquest by an infidel enemy referred to as al-aduw al-kafir, in this case the French, and the defense of the rebels' traditional and sedentary way of life and the prevailing social order from foreign interference.M√©ouchy, ed. Liebau 2010, p. 514. In the early phase of the revolt, Hananu and Barakat acted as representatives of Faisal's Arab government and continued to claim that they had the support of Faisal after the latter was ousted from Syria in July 1920.Arsuzi-Elamir, ed. Sluglett and Weber 2010, p. 594. Despite the collapse of the state they were ostensibly fighting under, the rebels resumed their struggle. In his memoirs, al-Sa'dun stated that the rebels engaged in jihad as an individual responsibility, instead of a duty delegated to them by a state. In his view, the individual rebel was required to behave virtuously in his personal life and with expertise and courage on the battlefield. Moreover, he had to strive to be a popular hero (batal sha'bi) close to his people, brave and pious. Arsuzi-Elamir asserts that while religious terminology was used by the rebels, the rebels' \\"motivation was fundamentally nationalist\\" and that \\"religion does not seem to have played a more important role\\" than nationalist feeling. Moreover, the Islamic solidarity between the Turks and the Syrians did not prevent the withdrawal of Turkish support for the revolt in Syria.Arsuzi, ed. Sluglett and Weber 2010, p. 595. According to historian Keith David Watenpaugh, the language used by Hananu and Saleh al-Ali in their address to the League of Nations \\"undermine\\" Arab and Turkish nationalist claims that their revolts represented part of the Arab or Turkish national awakenings. Hananu and al-Ali both referred to their revolts as part of a unified national resistance movement, but Watenpaugh states that the nation referred to was an Islamic community rather than the ethnic nationalism that steadily dominated Syrian and Turkish politics and society in the 20th century. Hananu and al-Ali also stressed modernist principles about individual rights, and according to Watenpaugh, Hananu did not view the concepts of modernity, Islam and the Ottoman state to be mutually exclusive. Hananu had opposed many Ottoman policies in the pre-World War I period, but was nonetheless wary of separatism as someone who formed part of the educated Ottoman middle class, while al-Ali sought a return to a \\"decentralized Ottoman polity dominated by Muslims in which the state would protect his hegemony as a landowning rural chieftain\\".Watenpaugh 2014, p. 179. Hananu and the rebel commanders had a deep attachment to their place in society and viewed French rule as an assault on their status, ambitions and dignity. Legacy The French Mandate of Syria in 1922 As a result of the Hananu and Alawite revolts, the French authorities discovered pacifying northern Syria was a more difficult task than pacification of the Damascus region. Following the collapse of the Hananu Revolt, some political leaders in Aleppo continued to hope that the Turks would oust the French from northern Syria and unify Aleppo with its Anatolian hinterland, but the withdrawal of Turkish support for the rebels in Syria, following agreements with France, caused a deterioration in Syrian-Turkish ties and left the rebels and nationalists of northern Syria feeling betrayed.Khoury 1987, p. 111. Disillusionment with Mustafa Kemal's policies regarding Syria made Turkey's remaining Syrian supporters realign their positions closer to Aleppo's Arab nationalists.Khoury 1987, p. 112. In the few years after the revolt, Aleppo's elite largely embraced the concept of a united Syrian struggle for independence from French rule. This shift also began a process of strengthening ties with the leaders of Damascus. Hananu's leadership of the revolt gained him wide popularity in Syria. Referring to Hananu, Khoury wrote \\"No name was more familiar to children growing up in Syria in the twenties and thirties; stories of his heroics were standard bedtime fare.\\"Khoury 1987, p. 454. In Ba'athist historiography, Hananu became a hero of the Syrian Arab nationalist movement. The Hananu Revolt was a turning point in Aleppo's relationship with the Arab nationalist movement. Under the influence of Hananu, his Arab Club, and other Aleppine leaders with similar politics, the Muslim elite of Aleppo gradually embraced Arab nationalism. Hananu later became a founding member of the National Bloc in 1928, which according to Syrian historian Sami Moubayed, was \\"created out of the defeat of the armed revolts of the 1920s\\".Moubayed 2006, p. 376. The National Bloc advocated diplomatic means to combat French rule and was the principal opposition movement against the French authorities until Syria's independence in 1946.

Hananu is seated first from the right at the top row, while Saleh al-Ali who led the Alawite Revolt is seated first from right at the bottom row In September 1920, Gouraud established the State of Aleppo, which consisted of the northern half of former Ottoman Syria, excluding the Tripoli district. The French authorities established a new bureaucratic administration in Aleppo led by four local, pro-French sympathizers and mostly staffed by their family members. After the revolt was stamped out, the French authorities arrested or exiled numerous Arab nationalist politicians in an attempt to end the nationalist alliance between Aleppo and Damascus. The authorities also began appointing former Ottoman administrators who were willing to cooperate with them to senior bureaucratic posts. According to Khoury, \\"by 1922, the Aleppo bureaucracy had become more unwieldy and inefficient than it had been in the last years\\" of Ottoman rule.Khoury 1987, p. 114. Despite French attempts to completely exclude the nationalists from any administrative role, the overwhelming majority of Aleppo's population supported the nationalists. As a result of the Franco-Syrian War, Turkey annexed the southwestern Anatolian sanjaks (districts) that had been part of Aleppo Vilayet, such as Mar'ash, Gaziantep ('Ayntab), Rumkale (Qal'at Rum) and Urfa (al-Ruha). These sanjaks became part of Turkey following the October 1921 treaty with France. Aleppans opposed the Turkish annexation. The Franco-Turkish treaty allowed for a resumption of commerce between Aleppo and the Alexandretta Sanjak, including Antioch, due to improved security conditions, but commerce between Aleppo and Anatolia largely ceased. Alexandretta was considered by Aleppans to be their port to the Mediterranean Sea and a crucial part of their socio-economic region. It remained part of Syria under French control, but was administered by a semi-autonomous government that was heavily influenced by Turkey. Aleppo's merchants and nationalist politicians feared this autonomy would ultimately lead to its annexation by Turkey and consequently precipitate an economic crisis in Aleppo;Khoury 1987, pp. 110‚Äì111. Alexandretta was separated from Syria in 1938 and became part of Turkey in the following year.

Episodes featured performances of current popular songs in a concept derived from the American series Your Hit Parade. Premise The series featured the week's most popular songs in the traditional pop and contemporary genres. Guests performers and disc jockeys appeared in the series. Austin Willis hosted the series with regular performers Joyce Hahn, Wally Koster, Phyllis Marshall, and singing group the MCs. Adam Timoon joined the series for the 1956-57 season. The series house orchestra was led by Bert Niosi. Choreography was directed by Alan and Blanche Lund. Production The series was based on staged performances of the current most popular songs for which the series team spent considerable effort in developing the sets, choreographing the song presentations and planning camera positions. Since some songs were top chart hits for multiple weeks, show producers were challenged to vary the presentation of these songs from episode to episode. For example, the song \\"Green Door\\" was a top chart hit for 19 weeks during the 1956-57 season. The series concentrated on the lighter pop styles of music. Rock songs were occasionally included on Cross-Canada Hit Parade which were attractive to youth viewers but rejected by adult audiences. For example, Bill Haley & His Comets performed \\"Rock Around the Clock\\" and \\"See You Later, Alligator\\" in the 29 February 1956 episode. By the beginning of the 1957-58 season, producers Drew Crossan and Stan Harris indicated that the series would not be transformed into \\"a rock 'n roll runaway\\". They also noted the difficulty in adapting Elvis Presley's songs to an appropriately visual format for the series. Music '60 producer Norm Sedawie noted there were few objections after curtailing rock songs on Hit Parade by 1960. In 1959, CBC financial figures released to the Commons Broadcasting Committee revealed that each week's episode of Cross-Canada Hit Parade typically cost $30,132 of which $8,214 represented expenses for talent. Sponsorship revenues were $9,678, leaving $20,454 to be supported by government funding. Episodes The first season began with minimal advance promotion. Episodes aired 9 p.m. Wednesdays in a half-hour time slot. Jaye P. Morgan was the guest singer on the 12 October 1955 debut episode. Paul Anka was a guest on the series prior to attaining international stardom. Cab Calloway also appeared on the 11 April 1956 episode. The Happy Gang appeared on 9 May 1956. For the 1959-60 season, the series was rebranded as Music '60 Presents the Hit Parade, airing on alternate Mondays but lengthened to an hour. A series featuring Jack Kane aired on the other Mondays, also under the Music '60 banner. The season debut on 12 October 1959 featured guest performances from The Everly Brothers and Hermione Gingold and introduced a larger studio space. The final episode on 11 July 1960 featured Della Reese and Jonathan Winters.

Wavelet coefficients can efficiently represent a signal which has led to data compression algorithms using wavelets. Wavelet analysis is extended for multidimensional signal processing as well. This article introduces a few methods for wavelet synthesis and analysis for multidimensional signals. There also occur challenges such as directivity in multidimensional case.  Multidimensional separable discrete wavelet transform (DWT)  The discrete wavelet transform is extended to the multidimensional case using the tensor product of well known 1-D wavelets. In 2-D for example, the tensor product space for 2-D is decomposed into four tensor product vector spaces as } This leads to the concept of multidimensional separable DWT similar in principle to the multidimensional DFT. gives the approximation coefficients and other subbands: low-high (LH) subband, high-low (HL) subband, high-high (HH) subband, give detail coefficients. Implementation of multidimensional separable DWT  Wavelet coefficients can be computed by passing the signal to be decomposed though a series of filters. In the case of 1-D, there are two filters at every level-one low pass for approximation and one high pass for the details. In the multidimensional case, the number of filters at each level depends on the number of tensor product vector spaces. For M-D, filters are necessary at every level. Each of these is called a subband. The subband with all low pass (LLL...) gives the approximation coefficients and all the rest give the detail coefficients at that level. For example, for and a signal of size , a separable DWT can be implemented as follows: The figure depicts 3-D separable DWT procedure by applying 1-D DWT for each dimension and splitting the data into chunks to obtain wavelets for different subbands Applying the 1-D DWT analysis filterbank in dimension , it is now split into two chunks of size . Applying 1-D DWT in dimension, each of these chunks is split into two more chunks of . This repeated in 3-D gives a total of 8 chunks of size . The figure shows the 3-D analysis filterbank for 3-D separable DWT Disadvantages of M-D separable DWT The wavelets generated by the separable DWT procedure are highly shift variant. A small shift in the input signal changes the wavelet coefficients to a large extent. Also, these wavelets are almost equal in their magnitude in all directions and thus do not reflect the orientation or directivity that could be present in the multidimensional signal. For example, there could be an edge discontinuity in an image or an object moving smoothly along a straight line in the space-time 4D dimension. A separable DWT does not fully capture the same. In order to overcome these difficulties, a method of wavelet transform called Complex wavelet transform (CWT) was developed.  Multidimensional complex wavelet transform Similar to the 1-D complex wavelet transform, tensor products of complex wavelets are considered to produce complex wavelets for multidimensional signal analysis. With further analysis it is seen that these complex wavelets are oriented. This sort of orientation helps to resolve the directional ambiguity of the signal. Implementation of multidimensional (M-D) dual tree CWT  Dual tree CWT in 1-D uses 2 real DWTs, where the first one gives the real part of CWT and the second DWT gives the imaginary part of the CWT. M-D dual tree CWT is analyzed in terms of tensor products. However, it is possible to implement M-D CWTs efficiently using separable M-D DWTs and considering sum and difference of subbands obtained. Additionally, these wavelets tend to be oriented in specific directions. Two types of oriented M-D CWTs can be implemented. Considering only the real part of the tensor product of wavelets, real coefficients are obtained. All wavelets are oriented in different directions. This is 2m times as expansive where m is the dimensions. If both real and imaginary parts of the tensor products of complex wavelets are considered, complex oriented dual tree CWT which is 2 times more expansive than real oriented dual tree CWT is obtained. So there are two wavelets oriented in each of the directions. Although implementing complex oriented dual tree structure takes more resources, it is used in order to ensure an approximate shift invariance property that a complex analytical wavelet can provide in 1-D. In the 1-D case, it is required that the real part of the wavelet and the imaginary part are Hilbert transform pairs for the wavelet to be analytical and to exhibit shift invariance. Similarly in the M-D case, the real and imaginary parts of tensor products are made to be approximate Hilbert transform pairs in order to be analytic and shift invariant. Consider an example for 2-D dual tree real oriented CWT: Let and be complex wavelets: and . The support of the Fourier spectrum of the wavelet above resides in the first quadrant. When just the real part is considered, has support on opposite quadrants (see (a) in figure). Both and correspond to the HH subband of two different separable 2-D DWTs. This wavelet is oriented at . Similarly, by considering , a wavelet oriented at is obtained. To obtain 4 more oriented real wavelets, , , and are considered. The implementation of complex oriented dual tree structure is done as follows: Two separable 2-D DWTs are implemented in parallel using the filterbank structure as in the previous section. Then, the appropriate sum and difference of different subbands (LL, LH, HL, HH) give oriented wavelets, a total of 6 in all. The figure shows the Fourier support of all 6 oriented wavelets obtained by a 2-D real oriented dual tree CWT Similarly, in 3-D, 4 separable 3-D DWTs in parallel are needed and a total of 28 oriented wavelets are obtained. Disadvantage of M-D CWT Although the M-D CWT provides one with oriented wavelets, these orientations are only appropriate to represent the orientation along the (m-1)th dimension of a signal with dimensions. When singularities in manifold of lower dimensions are considered, such as a bee moving in a straight line in the 4-D space-time, oriented wavelets that are smooth in the direction of the manifold and change rapidly in the direction normal to it are needed. A new transform, Hypercomplex Wavelet transform was developed in order to address this issue. Hypercomplex wavelet transform The dual tree hypercomplex wavelet transform (HWT) developed in consists of a standard DWT tensor and wavelets obtained from combining the 1-D Hilbert transform of these wavelets along the n-coordinates. In particular a 2-D HWT consists of the standard 2-D separable DWT tensor and three additional components: For the 2-D case, this is named dual tree quaternion wavelet transform (QWT). The total redundancy in M-D is tight frame. Directional hypercomplex wavelet transform The hypercomplex transform described above serves as a building block to construct the directional hypercomplex wavelet transform (DHWT). A linear combination of the wavelets obtained using the hypercomplex transform give a wavelet oriented in a particular direction. For the 2-D DHWT, it is seen that these linear combinations correspond to the exact 2-D dual tree CWT case. For 3-D, the DHWT can be considered in two dimensions, one DHWT for and another for . For , , so, as in the 2-D case, this corresponds to 3-D dual tree CWT. But the case of gives rise to a new DHWT transform. The combination of 3-D HWT wavelets is done in a manner to ensure that the resultant wavelet is lowpass along 1-D and bandpass along 2-D. In, this was used to detect line singularities in 3-D space. Challenges ahead The wavelet transforms for multidimensional signals are often computationally challenging which is the case with most multidimensional signals. Also, the methods of CWT and DHWT are redundant even though they offer directivity and shift invariance.

It opened in 1929 as the first power station in the region and was the first public electricity supply in Golden Bay. After closing in 1980 following damage to the generator, the power scheme was fully restored by the local Pupu Hydro Society and many volunteer groups over the course of seven years and re-opened in 1988, again supplying electricity to the national grid. The scenic Pupu Hydro Walkway follows the historic gold mining water-race between the penstock and the weir at Campbell Creek, before returning along the opposite side of the valley. The track was opened in 2003 and also leads past the power house, where a window provides a view into the turbine room. Construction The first water-race was constructed from 1901 to 1902 by the Takaka Sluicing Company over 8 months by a crew of 24 men working 8-hour shifts. It diverted water from Campbell Creek at a gentle gradient along the steep hillside, travelling over several timber aqueducts along its original course. The gold claim in the Waikoropupu Valley was worked from the 1850s until around 1910.\\"The Water-Race - Engineering Masterpiece for its Time\\" information panel at start of track Following a public meeting in 1924, an interim power board was formed to investigate the development of a local hydro scheme in response to the increasing promotion of electricity as a new energy source following the 1918 Electric Power Boards Act. The proposed Pupu Hydro Power Scheme was however deemed uneconomical by the central government, and local rate payers voted to take on a loan of ¬£24,000 and proceed with the construction, which involved upgrading the disused Campbell Creek water-race, building a penstock and a powerhouse. On 11 October 1929, the Golden Bay Electric Power Board officially opened the power scheme, lighting up the first public electricity supply in Golden Bay and enabling households to have access to electric lighting, appliances and radio. This scheme, and the later Onekaka Hydro Scheme, allowed Golden Bay's power generation to be self-sufficient up until 1944, when the much larger Cobb Power Station began generating power into the national grid and the Golden Bay Electric Power Board started taking supply from the main grid. The Pupu Power Scheme survived as an emergency backup, and apart from lightning strike damage in 1956 continued to operate until 1980 when the alternator stator burned out in a 'flashover' short circuit. After 51 years of operating reliably, the shut down power scheme was put up for tender in 1980. Restoration Pupu Hydro Powerhouse turbine room Following 7 years of negotiations from 1981 to 1987, an agreement was signed between the Tasman Electric Power Board and the Pupu Hydro Society to take on a loan and fully restore the Pupu Hydro Power Scheme as a working \\"museum\\". The water race and penstock were partly rebuilt, a motorised filter and new control gates were installed, and a spillway weir was constructed. The powerhouse was renovated and all equipment was either restored, refurbished or replaced. The 250 kVA 400 V alternator from 1929 was rewound and reinsulated by the ASEA New Zealand branch, the original supplier of the generator. The stator pack was completely replaced, control gear and relays were refurbished, and the Boving twin-jet pelton wheel was recast with 24 new buckets.Pupu Hydro Society information panel at start of track After completion of the restoration at an estimated total cost of $280,000, and with the strong support from many local groups and volunteers, the fully restored Pupu Hydro Power Scheme was reopened on 10 April 1988 once again as a fully operational hydroelectric power station. Later in 1991, the Pupu Hydro Society purchased the powerhouse and the surrounding of land from the Tasman Electric Power Board, and in 2003 finished construction of the loop track. Current operation The drop from the headpond down the penstock to the powerhouse yields a strong of water pressure, which is regulated by a valve at the powerhouse. Twin jets of water power the Boving twin-speer pelton wheel with a maximum water flow of 350 litres per second. The alternator is rated at 250 kW and supplies 400 V, stepped up to 11 kV to feed into the main power grid. Average annual energy output is 1.8 GWh, well up from the original power scheme's 0.8 GWh/year output. The Pupu Hydro Scheme is listed as an historic site by Heritage New Zealand. The Pupu Hydro Society continues to provide maintenance of the power scheme, funded by the sale of generated power on the spot-price electricity market. Excess profits go back into various Golden Bay community projects. Pupu Hydro Walkway The Pupu Hydro Walkway is a 1.5 to 2 hour loop track starting at the end of the unsealed Pupu Valley Road, past the more well-known Pupu Springs. The walk passes through the mature podocarp and beech forest of Kahurangi National Park, first zig-zagging up to the penstock, and then following the gentle gradient of the historic gold mining water-race along the steep hill side for on a narrow boardwalk. The concrete water race and the boardwalk have been restored, including continuous railing on the sections along steep drop-offs.

She is head of the Australasian Wildlife Genomics Group and research expert in the area of comparative genomics and immunogenetics, including Tasmanian devils and koalas, two iconic Australian species that are threatened by disease processes. Throughout her career, she has disproved the idea that marsupial immune system is primitive, characterized the South American gray short-tailed opossum's immune genes, participated in the Platypus Genome Project, led research identifying the properties of platypus venom, and identified the cause of the spread of the Tasmanian devil's contagious cancer. Belov is an advocate for Women in STEM and leads a research team of largely female students and post-doctoral students. Biography Katherine Belov was born in Sydney, Australia in 1973 to Nick and Larissa Belov. Both of her parents were immigrants to Australia and of Russian heritage. Belov grew up in West Ryde, New South Wales and pursued her undergraduate degree at Macquarie University in human genetics. She was persuaded to change from human genetics to animal genetics by Professor Des Cooper who would become her PhD supervisor, and initially worked on grey kangaroos, but quickly changed to the study of marsupials. She challenged a theory by another researcher who believed that marsupials did not have a highly developed immune system and proved that they had sophisticated immune systems comparable to our own. The research inspired her to enroll in a PhD program on marsupial immunology at Macquarie University. She earned her PhD in 2002, and began her postdoctoral work at the Australian Museum with an Australian Research Council Fellowship. In 2004, as part of the team, Belov became one of the primary researchers to sequence the genome of the platypus. The results, involving the work of over 100 international scientists, were published in Nature in May 2008. Among the findings were that the platypus has unique anti-microbial peptides with broad- spectrum potential for fighting a variety of bacteria and viruses, and possibly staph infections in humans. Belov's research continued and she now leads her own team of researchers from the University of Sydney, they began to characterise the platypus venom, which has no antivenom and causes severe pain to humans. They were able to complete the analysis in 18 months, verifying seven snake-like zinc metalloproteinases, seven toxins similar to the alpha- latrotoxins of black widow spiders, six cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISPs) like those found in some lizards and gila monsters, as well as some minor components similar to those of sea anemone venom. In 2007, Belov accepted a lectureship position at the Faculty of Veterinary Science at the University of Sydney and began to focus on the contagious cancer, devil facial tumour disease, which started spreading through the Tasmanian devil population in 1996. She proposed that the problem was that devils lack major histocompatibility complex gene diversity. Belov proved her hypothesis, that devils do not mount an immune response to the cancer because the tumour's genetic makeup is so similar to their own. Belov became a full Professor of Comparative Genomics at the University of Sydney and has received an Australian Research Council (ARC) Future Fellow award to continue her research in identifying genes, not only for devils and platypuses, but for other native Australian species like skinks and wallabies. In 2014, she was awarded the Fenner Medal for research in biology from the Australian Academy of Science. In 2016, she was appointed to the new role of Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Global Engagement) at the University of Sydney. This role includes responsibility for managing the development and execution of the University's global engagement strategy. Belov's research team made some prominent discoveries in 2016. Firstly, new research that proved antimicrobial peptides (called cathelicidins) in Tasmanian devil's milk can kill the deadliest bacteria and fungi, an important discovery in the fight against superbugs. The second was the discovery of nine new genetic variants in the remote South West Tasmanian devil population. Belov has published over 170 peer-reviewed papers, including papers in Nature, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and PLoS Biology. Now, her team, the Australasian Wildlife Genomics Group, studies the molecular genetics and evolution of gene families and genomes of our native wildlife. Research is focused on the immune system, evolutionary conservation genetics and applications for conservation management. Belov promotes Women in STEM and sits on the University of Sydney SAGE Advisory Council. Belov received the Officer of the Order of Australia in recognition of her service as an academic and researcher to higher education (especially comparative genomics).

It was released on January 6, 2015 by Sony Music Mexico. After attaining success from her previous album, Mujer Divina, a tribute to Mexican singer-songwriter Agust√≠n Lara, Lafourcade decided to record an album with original recordings. Lafourcade spent three years in the writing process, searching for inspiration in different cities, resulting in songs with personal feelings regarding love. The song was produced by Lafourcade and enlisted Argentinian musician Cachorro L√≥pez to assist with the production, and wrote the track with Mexican artist Leonel Garc√≠a. After its release as the lead single from the album of the same title, \\"Hasta la Ra√≠z\\" received positive reviews from music critics. The song was also commercially successful, peaking at number 17 on the US Billboard Latin Pop Songs and number five in Mexico. A music video for the track was directed by Alonso Ruizpalacios and recorded at the Estudios Churubusco in Mexico City, gathering 300 fans who responded to an invitation posted by Lafourcade in social networks. The video ranked on the list for the \\"10 Best Latin Music Videos of 2015\\" by Latin Post. \\"Hasta la Ra√≠z\\" earned the accolades for Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Alternative Song at the 16th Latin Grammy Awards. Background In 2010, Natalia Lafourcade joined Mexican orchestra conductor Alondra de la Parra on the album Travieso Carmes√≠, a musical project created to celebrate the Bicentennial of Mexico. Lafourcade analyzed Mexican singer-songwriter Agust√≠n Lara's catalogue and decided to record a tribute album with his songs, since the singer wanted to give herself the opportunity to perform songs written by another person. In 2014, Lafourcade wanted to find a balance between heart, mind and body, and traveled to Veracruz, Colombia and Cuba, searching for inspiration to write new music. \\"This [new] album was made parallel to the experience of singing the Lara's music... is the result of my need to be proud of my songs.\\" Lafourcade said to V√≠velo Hoy. The album Hasta la Ra√≠z is Lafourcade's sixth studio album and is her first album of original material in six years, since Hu Hu Hu (2009) and was produced by Argentinean musician Cachorro L√≥pez, Mexican singer-songwriter Leonel Garc√≠a and herself after another record producer became very expensive. The album version of the track was released as a digital download on January 14, 2015 and a new version entitled \\"Canova's Root Version\\" was available on May 19, 2015. Lafourcade included the song on the live EP Spotify Sessions. \\"Hasta la Ra√≠z\\" is featured in the Italian edition of the album series Now Summer Hits 2015. Writing and recording Lafourcade overcame writer's block, but felt that the songs she wrote were too similar compared to her previous albums, so she sought inspiration from Lara's repertoire and her native country, Mexico. \\"One of the things I wanted to happen with this record was to find the connection with Mexico and its people again. I am Mexican proud of the positive parts that Mexico have, which are many.\\" Musically, the singer wanted simplicity. Lafourcade forced herself to write \\"without judgement\\", recording voice memos on her phone during the process. The singer was also inspired by the work of Latin American songwriters such as Sim√≥n D√≠az, Violeta Parra, Mercedes Sosa, Chavela Vargas, and Caetano Veloso. While recording demos, Lafourcade realized that the songs were more direct and emotional than her previous work. The writing process took three years to complete, resulting in approximately 30 songs, from which the singer selected \\"the strongest ones\\", since the album was about her personal life and wanted to record the best of the bunch to represent it, \\"more than making an album, I wanted to have songs... songs that could stand on their own.\\" \\"Hasta la Ra√≠z\\" was written by Lafourcade and Mexican singer-songwriter Leonel Garc√≠a, since Lafourcade wanted to experiment with other composers on her music and they became friends while working on her album Mujer Divina and his album Todas M√≠as (2012). Garc√≠a had an idea about the song, and they finished together the music. Laforcade referred to this collaboration as \\"magical\\", with this song being an anthem to the human strength, without forgetting our roots, \\"It came out of a conversation about maintaining a sense of connection to where you come from.\\" Garc√≠a played a huapango riff, and Lafourcade started singing along while producer Cachorro L√≥pez recorded everything, and the final result is from that session. Critical reception After its release, \\"Hasta la Ra√≠z\\" received positive reviews from music critics. Luis Romero of the website Coffee and Saturday and the music editor of Televisa Espect√°culos were in agreement that the song keeps a musical style similar to her previous album, Mujer Divina, with Agustin Lara's influence being evident. Andrew Casillas of Club Fonograma stated that the song sounds \\"rich\\", but resembles Chilean singer-songwriter Camila Moreno, and that even if it \\"doesn‚Äôt sound like a bold step outward for Natalia, there‚Äôs certainly no need to lower your expectations\\". Lissette Corsa, of MTV Iggy, declared that the \\"staccato strumming\\" of the track \\"evokes the huapango rhythm of Veracruz, Mexico, Lafourcade‚Äôs hometown\\". Lafourcade performed the track at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2015, where it won Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Alternative Song. Commercial reception \\"Hasta la Ra√≠z\\" was released as a promotional single from the same-titled album on January 14, 2015, and was later released as the second single, following \\"Nunca Es Suficiente\\". The song peaked at number five in Mexico's Monitor Latino Pop Songs chart, number nine in the Billbards Mexico Espa√±ol Airplay, and 27 in the General Airplay charts, respectively. In the United States, the track peaked at number 17 in the U.S. Billboard Latin Pop Songs chart, being the highest peak for a Lafourcade single, after \\"M√≠rame, M√≠rate\\" and \\"En el 2000\\" reached 19 and 35, respectively, in 2003. Following Lafourcade's performance at the Latin Grammys, the song climbed to number nine on the Billboard Latin Pop Digital Songs, with a sales increase of 86%, selling 1,000 downloads. Music video The music video was directed by Alonso Ruizpalacios, at the Estudios Churubusco in Mexico City, gathering 300 fans who responded to an invitation posted by Lafourcade in social networks. The singer asked her fans to send a thought inspired by the song or a personal story derived from their identification with \\"Hasta la Ra√≠z\\". \\"I thought that we would get few answers, but received almost 800 responses immediately, and later it turned into a riot and we did not know if they would get out of control, but nothing happened, my fans are super cool,\\" Lafourcade told Variety Latino. In the video, shot in black and white, Lafourcade is surrounded by several people who lead her to a stage to perform the last part of the song, in the meantime, Lafourcade throws flowers in the air, kisses a guy and plays a guitar. According to Milly Contreras of Latin Post the video \\"shows off the singer's individuality and simplicity\\" and included it at number 7 in the list for the \\"10 Best Latin Music Videos of 2015\\".

Most of the party's support comes from Chin State, where the original ZNC was headquartered. The party is most popular in the Tonzang and Tedim Townships, where their headquarters and strongholds are. The party has 15,000 members in Chin State. History The ZCD was founded as the Zomi National Congress (ZNC) in Daizang, Manipur, India in 1972. Under the leadership of T. Gougin and S. K. Samte, the organisation campaigned for the unification of the Zomi people in India and Myanmar, and submitted a memorandumMemorandum submitted to His Excellency V.V. GIRI, The President of India by the Zomi National Congress, Lamka to the then President of India V. V. Giri. It was a major goal for the ZNC that the first World Zomi Convention be held at Champhai, Mizoram, India from 19‚Äì21 May 1988; a goal which was completed. In 1988, after the 8888 uprising, the ZNC branch in Burma was registered as a political party. It was permitted to function as a political organisation until 1992, when the military junta abolished the party, and banned it from all political activities. Chin Sian Thang, 67, was chairman of the Zomi National Congress, until the party's dissolution. Elected as a Member of Parliament during Burma's ill-fated 1990 elections, he worked diligently for several years in defiance of the country‚Äôs ruling military junta. During the 1960s, Cin Sian Thang served as a leader of the Chin Ethnic Student Union while a student at Rangoon University. He has been imprisoned on at least six occasions by successive military regimes for his political activities between 1972 and 1999. In each instance, he served two years, during which he was subjected to brutal interrogations and torture, which has led to permanent health problems. He also served as a member of the Committee Representing People‚Äôs Parliament, a group supported by 251 candidates elected in 1990. Considered a moderate ethnic leader, Cin Sian Thang heavily promoted the CRPP as a rallying point for Burmese activists and ethnic leaders. He was the most outspoken elected ethnic leader in Myanmar.

The Ge people are not officially recognised as national minority group, but as a sub-group under the Miao people. This is primarily because they speak the same language as the Miao people called Hmongic language, with slight variation. They are also often classified as Gejia people, who are living in a different region. Having constant conflict with their neighbouring Miao, they demanded for separate identity, and are officially categorised under \\"unidentified\\" status. With their unique custom and traditional practices, they consider themselves as distinct ethnic group. The total population is reported to be over 125,000. Their principal habitation is the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture in southeastern Guizhou province of southwestern China. Although majority of the people hold the ethnic religion, a small fraction of them were converted to Christianity by missionaries who entered in the 1920s. History The Ge people are considered to have originated from the Miao people. Their origin is explained in two different stories. According to one legend, once, an elite class of Han soldier met a Miao girl. He was in love with her and decided to marry her. At the time such inter-marriage between Han and Miao people was considered a sacrilege. The penalty was forfeit of official status and position. Overcome by love, they were married and were banished in isolation. In time, their descendants grew into a separate ethnic group. In another account, the Ge are a group of Miao in the western region who were left behind while the main Miao people migrated towards the east. On historical account, they originally inhabited the western part of Guizhou, and migrated to eastward to their present location. Migration was due to a policy of Chinese government to sympathise Miao people on behalf of the serving Miao soldiers. Society The Ge people are separated into a number of villages. The size of their settlement vary according to the altitude of their habitation. Those in the highest altitude, such as the plateaus of Guizhou and Yunnan provinces, each village is composed of around 20 households. Whereas towards the valleys, villages are as large as 1,000 households. In contrast to other people in the same region, they do not construct their houses on elevated pilings. Their main occupation is agriculture and most of them practice slash-and-burn method. However, those villagers near to or admixture with the Han people employ sophisticated land use, from regular plowing and irrigation to use of fertilisers. Rice, wheat, and tobacco are their principal crops. Ethnic identity When the Communist Party of China came into power, in the 1953, it initiated classification of the ethnic groups in China. Based on social history, economic life, language and religion, China officially approved 38 of them as distinct ethnicity in 1954, out of the 400 groups investigated.) The Ge people were categorised as sub-group of the main minority Miao. But the Ge claimed independent ethnicity, particularly considering their different customs and chronic hostility towards each other. Historically, they were at constant war with Miao and other people such as Qiang. Their demand for separation emerged into a political issue in the 1980s. With support of intellectuals on their claim of ethnic uniqueness, they made public shows, invited officials to investigate their villages, and publicised their demand in media. One of their most effective strategies was increased production of their handicrafts, and thereby attracting tourism. Ge women are known for their batik making, which are one of the main tourist attractions. The demand for ethnic identity came to height in 1986, when they withheld their grains for tax. Religion The Ge people practice a combination of traditional religions, along with animism, polytheism and ancestor worship. In the past, they incorporated elements of Daoism and Buddhism into their native religion. According to the traditional animism, they believe that the world is full of demons, ghosts, dragons, angels and spirits, which are representations of the afterlife of their ancestors, animals, and trees. They have shamans to ward off evil spirits. Their unique ritual called \\"Harong\\" is an elaborate worship of ancestors. Christianity Although Christianity is not the principal religion, it has significant impact among the Ge people. Out of the total population, hardly 130 people have converted to Christianity since the arrival of Christian missionaries in the 1920s. The first missionary was an Australian, Maurice H. Hutton, who arrived among the Ge people in 1925. Hutton noted that the first Christian convert was in 1935. After two years there were families of Christian, and Hutton made a hymn book and catechism for them. Hutton left in 1937, and the Chinese government extradited missionaries in China in 1951, so that most converts returned to their traditional religion.

She wrote on horticultural topics as Mrs. Francis King. Early life and family Louisa Yeomans was born on 17 October 1863 in Washington, New Jersey, the third of five children of Alfred and Elizabeth Blythe (Ramsay) Yeomans. Her father was a Presbyterian minister. She received secondary education from private schools in New Jersey and so far as is known did not go on to college. On 28 June 1890, she married a wealthy Chicago man, Francis King (1862‚Äì1927), and moved to Elmhurst, Illinois, near the home of Francis's parents. The couple had three children, Elizabeth, Henry W., and Frances. Francis's parents were Henry W. and Aurelia King. The senior Kings lived at an estate called Wilder Park, which they had inherited from wealthy businessman Seth Wadhams, who had originally named it White Birch. Louisa's mother-in-law was a skilled gardener, having cultivated 200 varieties of herbs, flowers, plants, and fruit trees, and her library was well-stocked with books on horticulture. Under the instruction and encouragement of the elder Mrs. King, Louisa King developed both an academic interest in the study of plants as well as a practical enjoyment of the hands-on work of gardening: amending soils, pruning, and controlling pests. Career In 1902, as a result of poor health, Francis King moved to a sanitarium in Alma, Michigan. The couple built a home called Orchard House, and Louisa King began to create gardens there, with the assistance of gardener Frank Ackney. In the planning of her garden, Louisa King was influenced by the then-popular books Elizabeth and Her German Garden (1898), by Elizabeth von Arnim, and A Woman's Hardy Garden (1903), by Helena Rutherfurd Ely. The garden at Orchard House would later feature in a number of her writings.Clayton, Virginia Tuttle, ed. The Once & Future Gardener: Garden Writing from the Golden Age of Magazines. David R. Godine, 2000. Louisa King quickly rose to prominence as a lecturer, author, and organizer of garden clubs. By 1910, she was contributing articles to magazines such as Garden Magazine, House Beautiful, Saturday Evening Post, Garden Life, and Country Life. For three years, starting in 1922, she wrote a monthly gardening column for House Beautiful. King corresponded with notable British and American gardeners of the day, including Gertrude Jekyll. As an advocate of \\"modern\\" gardening, King favored gardens that fit naturally into the landscape; she promoted solid fields of color as opposed to the scattered arrangements used by more traditional Victorian era gardeners. King counted among her correspondents and friends Charles Sprague Sargent of the Arnold Arboretum and landscape architects Fletcher Steele, Ellen Biddle Shipman, and Martha Brookes Hutcheson. King's first book, The Well-Considered Garden, appeared in 1915, the first of ten books published in a 15-year period on topics such as soil management, garden planning, and tool care. It is still considered a classic, and Gertrude Jekyll, who had become a friend and admirer of King's work, wrote the preface. King believed that gardening and garden clubs could be important forces to promote democracy and peace. In 1911, she founded the Garden Club of Michigan, serving as its first president. Two years later, she was one of the cofounders and original vice-presidents of the Garden Club of America in Philadelphia (GCA), which had a substantial influence on how landscape architecture developed as a profession in subsequent decades. In 1914, she helped to found the Women's National Agricultural and Horticultural Association, which two years later changed its name to the Woman's National Farm & Garden Association (WNF&GA;). King, who served as the first president of the WNF&GA; from 1914 to 1921, saw horticulture and gardening as a means for women to establish themselves in the world; under her guidance, the WNF&GA; established scholarships for women to pursue academic study of agriculture, botany, and landscape architecture.Seale, William. The Garden Club of America: One Hundred Years of a Growing Legacy. Smithsonian Books, 2012. During World War I, the WNF&GA; and GCA helped organize the Woman's Land Army of America: 15,000 so-called \\"farmerettes\\" worked in agriculture, replacing men called into military service. For her role in these efforts, King was awarded the National War Garden Commission‚Äôs bronze medal. In the postwar years, gardening in small suburban plots grew in popularity, spurred by the nine-volume series of books that King edited (and some of which she wrote), known as \\"The Little Garden\\" series. These books were directed at a wider audience than that of King's earlier books, which spoke to the affluent. King's descriptive prose was supplemented by plant lists, garden diagrams, photographs, and illustrations. Later life and death Her husband's unexpected death in 1927 forced the sale of Orchard House. King traveled in Europe and then settled in New York. She bought a home in South Hartford, New York, naming it Kingstree, and set up a smaller garden there. She established the state's first plowing contest. She continued to lecture and write; and she served as a gardening advisor to Montgomery Ward in 1936. A supporter of the United Nations, Louisa King proposed an International Horticultural Society, writing, \\"Gardeners never fight with each other.\\" Louisa King died on 16 January 1948 at her daughter's home in Milton, Massachusetts; her ashes are scattered at Kingstree in South Hartford. Recognition and legacy  Marker honoring Louisa Boyd Yeomans King. National Arboretum Dogwood Collection, Washington, D.C.King was once toasted by the Prince of the Netherlands, tongue-in-cheek, as the \\"King of America\\", and she has also been called the \\"fairy godmother of gardening in America\\", the \\"dean of American gardeners\\", and \\"the best-beloved and best-known American woman gardener\\" of her era.\\"Louise Yeomans King: Dean of American Gardeners\\". Michigan History Magazine, vol. 81, 1997. She was elected a fellow of the Royal Horticultural Society. In 1921, she became the first woman to receive the George Robert White Medal of the Massachusetts Horticultural Society. The Medal of Honor (also known as the Gold Medal) of the Garden Club of America was bestowed on her in 1923, making her the second recipient (after Charles Sprague Sargent) of one of the GCA's highest awards and one that was given out only four times in the first two decades of the GCA's existence. Cultivars of tulip, gladiolus, and daffodil have been named for her, and the Dogwood Collection at the National Arboretum in Washington, D.C., was created in her honor.Myer, Mary Eugenia. \\"Who Is Louisa King?\\".

The film was directed by former Pixar animator Dylan Brown in his directorial debut; while he was involved through most of the production period, Paramount Pictures dismissed him in January 2018, citing \\"inappropriate and unwanted conduct.\\" Wonder Park was released in 2D and 3D formats in the United States on March 15, 2019. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed over $119 million worldwide. A television series based on the film was scheduled to debut in 2019 on Nickelodeon, making it the third animated film from Nickelodeon Movies, after Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius and Barnyard, to serve as the basis for an animated series on the network. Plot June Bailey, a girl with a bright imagination, and her mother come up with the story of Wonderland, a magical amusement park run by a group of animals: Boomer, a big blue bear who greets guests; Greta, a wild boar; Gus and Cooper, beaver brothers; Steve, a porcupine who is the park's safety manager and is in love with Greta; and Peanut, the leader of the park and a chimpanzee who has the ability to create rides by listening to June's mother's voice. Over time, June's mother starts to get sick and is sent away for recovery, June starts alienating from Wonderland and burns the blueprints of the park out of frustration. Sometime later, June's father sends her to math camp. After misinterpreting a note from her father as a cry for help, June uses her friend Banky to create a distraction on the bus to escape and return home, but instead, she finds a broken-down Wonderland in the woods. The park is currently being surrounded by a cloud named the Darkness; June and the animals attempt to fix the park's mechanism but are attacked by Chimpanzombies, the park's former plush toys. In the chaos, June gets separated from the animals and finds herself in a floating chamber known as Zero-G Land. There, June finds Peanut hiding from the Darkness and confesses he felt lost after he stopped hearing the voice in his head, this leads June to realize that the Darkness was created by herself as a result of her cynicism from her mom's illness, the Chimpanzombies break in and take Peanut as their prisoner, but June manages to escape. June runs back to the animals to tell them she found Peanut but also confesses that she is responsible for the Darkness. Feeling upset over this revelation, they abandon her. After noticing the piece of the blueprint and realizing that she has been able to create the ideas for the park herself, June manages to fix one of the attractions to catch up with the animals and make it to the park's mechanics. She also explains why she created the Darkness, and seeing that she wants to help, the animals reform the team to save Peanut and Wonderland. The gang finds the Chimpanzombies taking Peanut to get sucked up into the Darkness. The animals fight back while June rushes to save Peanut by jumping into the void. She promises him that she will provide the voice for his imagination and that he should not let the Darkness take over him, giving him an idea to make a slide out of bendy straws to escape. While the gang and Peanut are riding the slide to avoid the chimpanzombies, June then notices that the park's mechanics is her name written in cursive, just like the blueprint piece. With Peanut's help, they get the mechanics back up and running by using her name to move the gears, and clear up Wonderland from the Darkness. A cloud remains over the park, to which June interprets as a reminder to continue to be imaginative. June returns home, and with it, her now cured mother, and they set up a Wonderland in their backyard. June then shares with other kids the story of Wonderland.

It is found in Europe, where it grows on woodchips or near conifer stumps. Taxonomy Originally described by Derek Reid in 1972 as a variety of Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca, it was raised to distinct species status in 2008. Molecular analysis of DNA sequences confirms its genetic uniqueness, and its status as sister species to H. aurantiaca. Description The fruit body has an orange- to dark brown cap, which is up to 10 cm (4 in) across. The stipe, flesh and decurrent gills are all orange. The gills are forked. Hygrophoropsis rufa can have a penetrating ozone-like smell, reportedly reminiscent of an orchid species Oncidium ornithorhynchum or a photocopier. Spores of H. rufa are thick-walled and have an ellipsoid shape, and measure 5.6‚Äì6.4 by 3.6‚Äì4.4 micrometres (Œºm). They have a strongly dextrinoid staining reaction with Melzer's reagent (resulting in a reddish-brown colour), although not all spores will react. Microscopically, the cells of the cap cuticle are arranged in the form of a trichoderm, where the outermost hyphae emerge roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the cap surface. These hyphae are of three types: broad, thick-walled and hyaline (translucent); filiform (threadlike); or with granular golden-brown contents. In contrast, the cap cuticle of H. aurantiaca is arranged as a uniformly tangled cutis (with hyphae parallel to the pileus surface). Habitat and distribution A rare species, H. rufa has been recorded in the United Kingdom, Austria, Germany, and Denmark, although unconfirmed internet photos suggest a wider range that includes France and Slovakia. A saprophytic fungus, it fruits on woodchips or near conifer stumps.

In 2006, Meteoblue was then founded as a spin-off company in order to serve customers especially in the area of agriculture as well as solar and wind power. The impetus for the creation of this service came with the Sandoz chemical disaster near Basel in 1986. During the fire, health and safety services tried to get information pertaining to the wind direction in order to protect the population from poisonous and noxious gases. After receiving conflicting information from Swiss, French and German meteorological services ‚Äì Basel is located at the tripoint of these three countries ‚Äì researchers at the local university formed the Institute for Meteorology, Climatology and Remote Sensing intending to model the local weather situation more precisely. As this meteorological service did not yet have its own dedicated data center, weather predictions offered through the university's website were not available at all times, but the service soon grew into a favoured information source for alpinists, para-gliders, astronomers and farmers. After the transition to a privately run meteorological company, Meteoblue was the world's first weather service to offer weather prediction in a graphical synopsis for any arbitrarily chosen location on earth.http://www.basellandschaftlichezeitung.ch/basel/basel- stadt/basler-anbieter-prognostiziert-das-wetter-fuer-die-ganze-welt-126964541 Beside that, it predicts weather for several continents on scales not familiar from other weather services, e.g. Europe using a 3 km (1.86 mi) grid, encompassing an area containing Belarus, Greece, Portugal and Ireland, or sub- Saharan Africa using a 10 km grid.

Son of Zorn is a joint production by Agnew Jorn√© Productions, Lord Miller Productions, and 20th Century Fox Television. Premise The series takes place in an alternate world where traditional animated characters co-exist with real-life humans. Zorn is a barbarian warrior from the fictional island of Zephyria who moves to Orange County, California, to reconnect with his ex-wife and teenage son Alangulon, \\"Alan\\" for short. Within the show, Zorn and things native to Zephyria are animated, following the style of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, while the rest of the world is live-action. The series' opening title cards are rendered in the style of fantasy cartoons of the 1980s such as He-Man and ThunderCats. Cast * Cheryl Hines as Edie Bennett, Zorn's ex-wife and Alan's mother. * Johnny Pemberton as Alangulon \\"Alan\\" Bennett, the titular character who is the vegetarian half-Zephyrian son of Zorn and Edie. * Tim Meadows as Craig Ross, Edie's fianc√© and an online college professor. * Artemis Pebdani as Linda Orvend, Zorn's boss at Sanitation Solutions in Orange County.

Production The show was created by Reed Agnew and Eli Jorn√© who wrote the pilot episode while Eric Appel directed. Initially Agnew and Jorne were set to be co-showrunners, however after Fox ordered the series to air Agnew backed out and was made co-executive producer instead. At this point, Sally McKenna was brought in to replace Agnew; McKenna would later, in April 2016, become the sole showrunner after Jorne also left the project. Artemis Pebdani and Tim Meadows' casting was announced in July 2015, with Jason Sudeikis, Cheryl Hines, and Johnny Pemberton's involvement announced the following November. Cancellation On May 11, 2017, the series was cancelled after one season. EpisodesReception Son of Zorn has received generally mixed reviews from television critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds a 58% approval rating based on 38 critics, and a 6.3/10 rating. The critical consensus reads: \\"Son of Zorn earns points for originality, a talented cast, and intermittent laughs, but they aren't quite enough to prop up a gimmick that's still in search of a workable premise for an ongoing series.\\" On Metacritic, the show holds a score of 56 out of 100 based on 18 critical media reviews indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".

The film, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Scoot McNairy, Maggie Grace, and Martin Donovan, was released on April 7, 2017 by Lionsgate Premiere. The film is based on events and persons surrounding the 2002 √úberlingen mid-air collision of a passenger airliner with a cargo jet, although the names, places, nationalities, and incidents were changed. It was released on video on demand. Plot Roman Melnyk, a construction worker, is allowed to leave work early to prepare for the arrival of his wife Olena and pregnant daughter Nadiya from New York City, aboard flight AX 112. At the airport to welcome his family, Roman receives the news that AX 112, with his wife and daughter on board, had been in an accident. From this point on, Roman is devastated and blames the air traffic controller for the deaths of his family. Meanwhile, in another angle of the story, Jacob \\"Jake\\" Bonanos, an air traffic controller, is happily married to a woman named Christina with whom he has a young son named Samuel. Jake is on duty the night of the crash, which occurs when his colleague is on coffee break, forcing Jake to do both their jobs, and the telephone lines (needed to communicate with other airports) are briefly non-working while under maintenance. He is devastated, after seeing AX 112 and the other flight, DH 616, disappear from the radar, showing that the two planes collided and were destroyed. Although the investigators cannot hold Jake responsible for the crash and the passengers' deaths, he blames himself; as time passes, he slowly unravels, straining the relationship with his family, and is unwilling to talk about what happened. It is reported that all 271 passengers and crew were killed in the mid-air collision. Roman goes to the crash site and, posing as a volunteer with no relationship with the victims, recovers his daughter's necklace and the bodies of his wife and daughter. At his home, Roman stays hidden inside, when Tessa Gorbett, a journalist, approaches, expressing interest in writing a book on the incident. She ends up leaving behind some prior articles of plane disasters she had written about (to show her fidelity to accuracy and objectivity, as a serious journalist) through the mail slot of the door. Because of the seriousness of the incident, his company's lawyer advises Jake to move to another state and adopt a new name for him and his family's safety. Roman meets lawyers John and James Gullick, who unsuccessfully try to convince him to sign an agreement stating that the airline will pay his expenses for medical and mental healthcare, plus $85,000 and $75,000 in damages for the loss of his wife and daughter, respectively. Roman refuses to sign it as neither the company nor the lawyers will express apologies for the loss of his family. One year later, Roman and other crash victims' relatives attend the inauguration of a newly completed memorial at the crash site. Jake, having moved to another state, now works at a travel agency, under the name \\"Pat Dealbert\\", and lives alone. Roman has also moved to another town and now works as a carpenter. Roman meets Tessa and asks her, as a favor, to find Jake. Tessa later reveals Jake's cover name and occupation, but she initially refuses to give his address. Roman tracks down the building where Jake is working and follows him to his apartment. There, after waiting a day, on a day when Christina and Samuel happen to be visiting Jake for the weekend, Roman confronts him at his door. Jake refuses to offer an apology, so Roman stabs Jake in the torso and neck. Jake falls to the floor and bleeds to death, while Christina and Samuel sob uncontrollably. Roman is convicted of murder and serves 10 years of his prison term, then is released early on parole, given the extenuating circumstances that motivated his crime. While visiting his family's grave, he meets a stranger. The stranger turns out to be Samuel, who has tracked Roman down with the intention of killing him to avenge his father's murder. However, Roman apologizes, and Samuel, moved by Roman's contrition, realizes he cannot go through with the execution because it's not what he was taught. He allows Roman to leave. Roman leaves the cemetery alive, but now must spend the rest of his life dealing with the aftermath of his crime.  Cast  Production  On June 23, 2015, it was announced that Arnold Schwarzenegger would star in Javier Gull√≥n's action drama script 478, which would be produced by Darren Aronofsky's Protozoa Pictures. On November 4, 2015, Emmett/Furla/Oasis Films (EFOF) came on board to finance and produce the film along with Protozoa, which Elliott Lester would direct. Lionsgate Premiere would release the film domestically, which would be produced by Protozoa's Aronofsky, Scott Franklin, and Eric Watson, and EFOF's Randall Emmett and George Furla, along with Peter Dealbert. In November 2015, Highland Film Group sold the film to different international distributors at the American Film Market. On December 24, 2015, Mariana Klaveno was cast in the film to play Eve Sanders, an airline representative who breaks the news to Roman (played by Schwarzenegger) of his tragic loss. Principal photography on the film began on December 14, 2015, in Columbus, Ohio, previously scheduled to begin on December 6. The film was expected to wrap up in mid-January 2016. Release The film was released on April 7, 2017. Reception=Critical response , the film holds a 41% approval rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 54 reviews with an average score of 5.18/10. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 44 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Vitaly Kaloyev, upon whose recollection of the actual events the film is based, criticized the film because of some \\"distortions\\". According to Kaloyev, he, unlike the main character of the film, did not seek anyone's pity or apology, but only wanted to achieve justice. Additionally, he stated that the real air traffic controller, Nielsen, unlike the air traffic controller portrayed in the film, showed no signs of remorse, but on the contrary, behaved with arrogance and contempt (at the time, Kaloyev had broken into Nielsen's house and was attempting to murder him in front of Nielsen's wife and children).

Built in 1755, it is a well-preserved example of Georgian architecture, with the largest period fireplace in Connecticut. The name comes from the prominent local families that owned it. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. It is now maintained by the Historical Society of Glastonbury. Description and history The Welles- Shipman-Ward House is located in South Glastonbury, on the east side of Main Street (Connecticut Route 17), a just north of its junction with Hopewell and High Streets. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. The main facade is five bays wide, with a symmetrical window arrangement around a slightly larger central bay, where the entrance is located. The entrance is flanked by pilasters, which rise to a corniced entablature. Windows on the ground floor are topped by slightly projecting cornices with dentil moulding. A secondary entrance is located on the building's right side, with a less elaborate surround. The house in 2018 The house was built in 1755 as a wedding gift for John Welles from his father Thomas. John's son George then sold the house to shipbuilder, merchant trader, and storeowner, Stephen Shipman, Jr. Shipman updated some of the architectural features, and the house remained in his family for over 125 years. In 1929, Berdena Hart Ward purchased the property and redecorated the house in an English country style. In 1963, Mrs. Ward donated the house and property to the Historical Society of Glastonbury with $10,000 endowment. Along with specialized historians, the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities and the American Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York were part of a committee formed to undertake the restoration of the house and ensure its authenticity.http://turleyct.com/archives/GL_1015_Layout.pdf During the restoration, records were found showing that the property once contained a schoolhouse which indicated that the main house may have served as a dormitory building. Further into the restoration process, carved initials and children's drawings were found under layers of plaster and paint that contributed to speculation that schoolchildren were housed there. Today the house and property is owned and maintained by the Historical Society of Glastonbury who run tours and a variety of historical events for the community there.

He was the school baseball team's ace pitcher in his final year, leading the school to victory in the Kagawa Prefecture tournament and earning a berth in the 2011 national high school championships. In the first round match against Okinawa Prefecture's Itoman High School, Matsumoto threw 11 strikeouts in his team's 4‚Äì1 victory. In the second round match against Akita Prefecture's Noshiro Shoyo High School, Matsumoto threw nine strikeouts and allowed only one earned run, but his team was unable to score in the 0‚Äì2 loss. Matsumoto's powerful performance, along with being the tallest player in the tournament at 193 cm, earned him the nickname \\"Eimei's Randy Johnson\\". He was the first round pick by the Yomiuri Giants in the 2011 rookie draft. Professional career Matsumoto entered professional baseball as the tallest ever Japanese-born left-handed pitcher. In 2012, his first season as a professional, he made 9 appearances for the Giants' farm team in the Eastern League, finishing with a 2‚Äì2 win-loss record and a 4.50 ERA. In 2013 Matsumoto was unable to play as he spent the year overcoming injuries to his shoulder. In 2014, he pitched in 16 games for the farm team, earning a 3‚Äì10 win-loss record and an ERA of 5.13. In 2015, he made 9 appearances for the farm team, finishing with a 1‚Äì1 record and a 4.50 ERA. Gambling scandal In October, 2015, Matsumoto was named as a result of an investigation conducted by the Giants into illegal betting on professional and high school baseball games by its players. On 9 November 2015, the Giants organization terminated Matsumoto's contract, along with fellow pitchers Satoshi Fukuda and Shoki Kasahara. On 10 November the NPB league commissioner penalized the three players with indefinite disqualification. Under league rules, Matsumoto will be able to apply for readmission to the league after 5 years if he satisfies the commissioner that he is remorseful for his actions. The disqualification extends to American Major League Baseball and the professional leagues in China, South Korea and Taiwan. The players avoided permanent disqualification because the investigation found no evidence that they were involved in fixing matches. The Giants were also fined ¬•10 million over the incident and the team's representative at the NPB, Atsushi Harasawa, resigned to take responsibility.

In the book, he argues that humanity is in need of a religious revolution that dispenses with the concept of God and elements of the supernatural, a revolution that expands individual and collective human empowerment by fostering a condition he calls \\"deep freedom\\"‚Äîa life of creativity, risk, experiment, and meaningful personal connection‚Äîprotected by structure-revising social and political structures of an empowered democracy hospitable to the context-breaking capacities inherent in human life. Overview=Background and objective Unger opens the book by describing the four incurable defects of human life: death, groundlessness, insatiability, and belittlement. The major world religious traditions, although having certain elements in common, have differed in how they have dealt with these four defects of human life. Unger describes three ‚Äúmoments‚Äù in the evolution of religious belief: a first moment, when human life was so precarious that the flaws of existence did not occupy a central place in human consciousness; a second moment, when humans had achieved some degree of freedom from dependence on nature, allowing high culture to emerge and address the basic flaws of existence, which were now at the center of human consciousness. A hallmark of this second moment of religious belief was the common feature of religion in assuring believers that everything is alright. For the third moment to occur, Unger argues that a religious revolution is needed, a thoroughly naturalistic development of religious belief which offers no assurance that everything is alright, but offers a heightened, intensified, and more meaningful life in the present, rather than at some indefinitely postponed future time. This ‚Äúreligion of the future‚Äù would offer a way of confronting life without illusions. In the next three chapters, Unger will address each of the three major world religious traditions and explain their shortcomings as inspiration and sources for the religion of the future. Critique of religious tradition of \\"overcoming the world\\" The religious tradition of overcoming the world, chiefly represented by Buddhism and Hinduism, is marked by a quest for serenity and benevolence. Unger contends that ‚Äúovercoming the world‚Äù cannot serve as a starting point for a future religious revolution, because this tradition seeks a deliberate dimming of consciousness and vitality in its quest for serenity. The religion of the future, Unger contends, must turn toward the world, not away from it, and a religious tradition that denies time and distinction, and urges us to turn away from engagement with the world, cannot be a basis for the religious revolution Unger envisions. Critique of religious tradition of \\"humanizing the world\\" The tradition of humanizing the world (represented by Confucianism) is marked by a belief that humans can find their place in the world by embracing an ethic of roles and the ennoblement of our relations with each other through this ethic of roles. Unger contends that this tradition, too, is unsuited to be a starting point for the religion of the future because it gives too much weight and authority to social structures and roles that may match the dispositions only of the most virtuous, conformist members of society. The picture of human morality presented by the tradition of humanizing the world is ultimately unrealistic, Unger contends, and fails to address in a satisfactory manner the flaws in human existence. Critique of religious tradition of \\"struggling with the world\\" According to Unger, the religious tradition that holds the most promise as a starting point for the religion of the future is the tradition of ‚Äústruggling with the world,‚Äù the semitic salvific religions including Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The tradition of ‚Äústruggling with the world‚Äù also has a secular voice, in the form of the major doctrines of emancipation including liberalism, socialism and democracy. The metaphysical vision of the various forms of ‚Äústruggling with the world‚Äù include several points in common: * There is one real world. * Time is inclusively real. * The new can happen. * History is open. * The self has unfathomable depth. * The ordinary has more promise than the high-flown. At the heart of the doctrine of the ‚Äústruggle with the world,‚Äù both in its religious and secular variants, is a conception of the self as embodied spirit. Unger explains a key aspect of the nature of the embodied spirit is that it can always overflow and exceed its contexts: ‚ÄúThere is more in us, in each of us individually and in all of us collectively--the human race--than there is or ever can be in them.‚Äù Unger explains how this context-transcending quality of human beings as embodied spirit is manifested in the context of the market economy, in areas of rigorous intellectual inquiry such as mathematics and physics, and in the confrontation of human beings with the enigmas of their experience in the context of religion. In each of these settings, Unger argues, we are not ‚Äúever entirely hostage to the social and conceptual worlds that have helped shape us. They may direct us over much of our lives, but they do not own us.‚Äù This view of human nature as irrepressibly context- transcending is at the heart of what Unger finds useful for the religion of the future in the doctrine of the struggle with the world, and it is this element of the doctrine that he embraces as the starting point for his vision of a religion of the future. But he finds that all of its contemporary forms, the tradition of struggling with the world is radically defective. Nature of the religious revolution represented by the religion of the future Unger argues that a new religious revolution would be thoroughly naturalistic and would pursue the task of enhancing life now, rather than promising salvation or reward in the indefinite future. Such a revolution would likely contain elements that resemble past religious revolutions such as visionary teaching and exemplary action, but would combined with elements unknown to the religious revolutions of the past. The religious revolution that Unger envisions would have the following qualities: * It would not centralize prophetic power in a single individual and his decisive action in history. * It would be concerned both with reshaping society as well as reorienting individual life. * It would include a vision for the cumulative transformation of society that would not be reducible to a definite blueprint or formula. * It would seek to remedy our condition of estrangement from the present moment, recognizing that time is our most precious possession, and that religion must help us transform our lives now, if only in fragmentary and inchoate form, no matter what changes are sought in the structure of society in historical time. * It would reject the taboo on the religious criticism of religion. Unger's conception of \\"deep freedom\\" and the social and political changes that would help bring it about Unger sets forth the structural changes in society that would be necessary to foster the emancipatory conditions of the religion of the future, to make society more open to experiment, fulfillment, connection, and surprise. At the heart of his political proposals in this chapter is the general concept of ‚Äústructure-revising structure,‚Äù and the various ways that this can be embodied in political and social institutions. Unger‚Äôs vision for politics in this chapter includes ‚Äúheating up‚Äù the political process, creating institutional mechanisms for breaking impasse between branches of government, and increasing mass mobilization of citizens so that all have a voice in the direction and operation of government. Quality of human life under the religion of the future Unger speculates on the quality that life would have under the regime instituted by a future religious revolution. Individuals would become freer to innovate, experiment, take risks, and look for trouble. Connections between people would be deeper and more meaningful. Social mechanisms and safety nets would be in place that would allow and encourage this climate of experiment, risk, cooperation and love. Reception Reviewing The Religion of the Future in the Journal of the American Academy of Religion, Andrew B. Irvine wrote that ‚Äúthe book demands to be read not as a contribution to scholarly debate but as a direct intervention in the most important and urgent issues of today ‚Ä¶ No review could cover all the angles from which this book deserves to be appreciated‚Äîand criticized.‚Äù Irvine contends that Unger‚Äôs argument ‚Äúdramatically ...simplifies the indefinitely complex data of religion, but it does so in the name of a single religious perspective.‚Äù Irvine asks: ‚ÄúWhat would this book look like if it were more deeply comparative and/or interreligious in its thinking? It is comparative and interreligious, of course, but Unger‚Äôs exclusivistic affirmation of the ‚Äòstruggle with the world‚Äô seems insufficiently informed.‚Äù Irvine concludes his review by applauding The Religion of the Future, stating that it ‚Äúmerits reading by philosophers, theologians, and activists, especially any who hold that a naturalistic metaphysics and praxis are vital to a flourishing human future. Its weaknesses are as instructive as its strengths.‚Äù Bonaventure Chapman, writing in the Catholic publication Dominicana, described The Religion of the Future as ‚Äúa prophetic vision of any future religion,‚Äù and stated that he considered the book, alongside Ronald Dworkin‚Äôs Religion Without God, to be an example of ‚Äúreligious atheism,‚Äù that is, a ‚Äúnew attitude to God‚Äù that ‚Äúpresents a new horizon for Christianity.‚Äù While strongly criticizing the book from a theistic standpoint, Chapman allows that this new religious atheism may represent a ‚Äúmaturing of the infantile atheism offered by the scientific naturalism perspective: it looks at the world and finds moral truth, objective value, and goodness.‚Äù Reviewing The Religion of the Future in Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews, Jeremy David Bendik-Keymer considered the book as the second part of the project that Unger began in The Self Awakened: Pragmatism Unbound and concluded in The Singular Universe and the Reality of Time. Bendik-Keymer summarizes Unger‚Äôs project in these works as one that ‚Äúseeks a world in which we live in the present, free of repression of, or reactive attitudes towards, the existential limitations of being human and in which we act collectively to create the conditions for ongoing innovation and self-transformation‚Äù (internal citations omitted). Bendik- Keymer complains that Unger‚Äôs depiction of human beings is ‚Äúbelittling‚Äù and concludes that Unger ‚Äúhas simply missed the mark‚Ä¶ Unger may think of his work as preparation for prophesy, but it ends up as pontification.‚Äù Quotes  p.236  p.314  p.349 ReferencesSources  External links * The Work of Roberto Mangabeira Unger (Unger's personal website), \\"Philosophy and Religion\\" 2014 non-fiction books Philosophy of religion Theology books Philosophy books Books in political philosophy Critical legal studies English-language books Books by Roberto Mangabeira Unger ","title":"The Religion of the Future"},{"id":"48522553","text":"The Journal of the San Juan Islands is a newspaper based in Friday Harbor, Washington. The Journal publishes on Wednesdays. It also publishes SanJuanJournal.com; Springtide, an annual magazine for visitors; The Book of the San Juan Islands, an annual almanac; and special sections related to aspects of island life. The Journal was adjudged a legal newspaper for the publication of any and all legal notices on May 6, 1941 by the San Juan County Superior Court. Early history The Journal was founded by Oscar G. Wall, with the first issue publishing on Sept. 13, 1906. Wall relocated to Friday Harbor from Lanesboro, Minnesota, where he had published a newspaper and, from 1878-1885, served on the village council.http://genealogytrails.com/minn/fillmore/township_history4.htm Originally named the Friday Harbor Journal, Wall launched the newspaper with a stated ambition of helping the thinly populated San Juan archipelago to improve beyond a largely farming- and fishing-based economy. The motto of The Journal in its early days was, ‚ÄúA Square Deal for Everybody.\\" The Journal was bought in 1907 by its editor, Virgil Frits (1882-1971), who owned, edited and published it until 1958 (Wall died in Friday Harbor on Aug. 16, 1911 at the age of 67 https://www.digitalarchives.wa.gov/Record/View/A2C28BF1AF6802ED632E94FC2109E32A). Frits was also a longtime town clerk of Friday Harbor. The Journal's competitor, the San Juan Islander, folded in 1914. During Frits' ownership, The Journal was located in the building next to the San Juan County Bank building, which is now the home of Coldwell Banker. The Journal's historic home is now a retail shop. 1990s and 2000s On Oct. 2, 1998, The Journal launched its online news site, SanJuanJournal.com, which gradually expanded to daily news coverage. For much of the first decade of the 2000s, SanJuanJournal.com had more unique visitors than any other online news site in the San Juan Islands. In 2000, The Journal ‚Äî which was locally published and locally managed ‚Äî was a pawn in a fraud involving its owner. At that time, The Journal was part of Lower Mainland Publishing Co., a subsidiary of Hollinger International, which Conrad Black and his associate David Radler controlled. Black and Radler arranged for Hollinger to sell The Journal and the Skagit Valley Argus, on May 1, 2000, to Horizon Publications, a company which they secretly owned, for the sum of $1. Horizon sold The Journal the following year to Black Press (an unrelated firm) for $280,000. The directors of Hollinger were not informed of a previous third-party offer of $750,000 for The Journal alone. The Journal has been owned since September 2001 by Sound Publishing, Inc., a division of Black Press and the largest community newspaper publisher in Washington. Between 1999 and 2011, The Journal regularly won awards for General Excellence and Community Service in the Washington Newspaper Publishers Association Better Newspapers Contest; in 2003, it won first place for General Excellence and first and third place for Community Service. In 2006, The Journal's editor won Best Feature Writer and Best Editorial Columnist honors from the Washington Newspaper Publishers Association and the Washington Press Association. In 2014, The Journal won 17 awards in the Washington Newspaper Publishers Association Better Newspapers Contest. Editors Editors of The Journal include: 1900s-1950s *Oscar G.

The archives include bound editions of The Journal dating to its earliest editions; bound editions of the San Juan Islander newspaper; and the paste-up boards containing camera-ready pages of journalist Lucile McDonald's 1990 book, \\"Making History: The People Who Shaped the San Juan Islands,\\" which was published by The Journal's now-defunct printing plant in Friday Harbor. Extra editions During the 2000s, The Journal ‚Äî which is printed on the mainland ‚Äî produced several extra editions using a high-quality copier in its office. The extras were distributed by hand and in stores, and were offered for free. Several election-night extras were produced. An extra was produced on May 9, 2002, when a devastating fire consumed nearly an entire block of downtown Friday Harbor; the edition also provided information on how residents could help in the recovery effort. The Journal also produced The Daily Fair, a free, four-page newspaper, during the San Juan County Fair; The Journal's booth at the fairgrounds served as a news bureau during the countywide fair. Journalism education From 2000-2010, the Journal conducted several programs for young journalists: 1) Internships. 2) Election- night reporting for the Associated Press. 3) Voices, a newspaper produced by teens for teens. 4) The Underground, the student newspaper for Friday Harbor High School. 5) The Virgil Frits Award for the year's outstanding student journalist. 6) A $1,000 scholarship for a graduating senior who planned to major in journalism. Three program participants went on to journalism careers. One, Colleen Smith Armstrong, is group publisher of The Journal, the Islands Sounder (Orcas Island), and the Islands Weekly (Lopez Island).

The sovereigns also still grant titles to certain persons deemed helpful in maintaining Javanese traditions and the dignity of the royal courts, even to non-Javanese.[* http://kelembagaan.pnri.go.id/beranda/berita/prnview_id.php?id=527] As Indonesia is not a monarchy, the Government of Indonesia does not confer any noble titles on its citizens. However, noble titles are still recognised officially as distinct from personal names. This is in contrast with the situation in e.g. Germany or Austria, in which personal names were forced to be used after the abolition of the monarchies. Minister of Home Affairs' Regulation no. 25 year 2011[State Gazette of the Republic of Indonesia Year 2011 No. 362] is one example of such state regulations that recognises and governs the use of noble titles within the Indonesian administration. Even the second vice-president of Indonesia (1973-1978) ‚Äî who was also the sultan of Yogyakarta ‚Äî was known officially by his regnal name, Hamengkubuwono IX. This list is created to help readers from a non-Javanese background to distinguish the noble titles from the personal names of individuals commonly known only by their noble titles. Notable examples are Raden Adjeng (R.A.) Kartini, Raden Panji (R.P.) Soeroso, and M. T. (Mas Tirtodharmo) Haryono.Popularly known as M. T. Haryono, the name given to him by his parents was actually only Haryono. Mas is a noble title, inherited from his father, while Tirtodarmo was his father's name. Such naming with patronymic included into a person's name was common in early 20th century, coping with Dutch naming conventions, which saw a person's name with only one word as awkward. cf. Oerip Soemohardjo Note that in Javanese alphabet the phoneme /…î/ is written with same letter and sign as 'a'. In Indonesian newspapers the sound /…î/ is generally written with the letter 'o', hence allowing for another mistake in pronunciation (with the phoneme /o/.Such difference might seem trivial; however, in some words the meaning of the words are very different e.g. c√•r√• (pronounced /tÕ° É…îr…î/) means 'manner, way', on the other hand coro (pronounced /tÕ° Éoro/) means 'cockroach'. Both words are usually spelled coro in general Indonesian spelling, as in the word pranotocoro (pronounced /pran…ît…î.tÕ° É…îr…î/), the 'Master of Ceremony' in traditional Javanese wedding. The letter √• in this list is used to show such difference and to prevent such mistake. The same purpose is also intended with the use of the letter √® to represent /…õ/. Plain e is pronounced /…ô/. The common abbreviations in Indonesian modern spelling are written next to each of the titles.

The park includes a portion of the Hudson River Palisades on the western shore of the Hudson River, and is part of the Palisades Interstate Park system. Hook Mountain State Park is functionally part of a continuous complex of parks that also includes Rockland Lake State Park, Nyack Beach State Park, and Haverstraw Beach State Park. A central feature of the park is Hook Mountain, a summit overlooking Rockland Lake and the Hudson River. History View of Hook Mountain from the Hudson River in November 2015 View from the summit of Hook Mountain in November 2017 Hook Mountain was known to Dutch settlers of the region as Verdrietige Hook, meaning \\"Tedious Point\\", which may have been a reference to how long the mountain remained in view while sailing past it along the Hudson River, or for the troublesome winds that sailors encountered near the point. Hook Mountain has also been known in the past as Diedrick Hook. Like other areas of the Hudson River Palisades, the landscape now included in Hook Mountain State Park was threatened by quarrying in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. To ensure the land's protection, the property was acquired to be a part of the Palisades Interstate Park in 1911. Portions of Hook Mountain State Park and nearby Nyack Beach State Park were designated as a National Natural Landmark in 1980 for their portion of the Palisades Sill. Hook Mountain was designated by the New York Audubon Society as an Important Bird Area in 1997, due to its importance as a feeding area for migratory songbirds and hawks. It has been utilized annually as a hawk monitoring station since 1971. The park is currently designated as a \\"Bird Conservation Area\\" by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. In May 2015, the Sisters of Our Lady of Christian Doctrine announced that they were considering allowing their property to become a part of Hook Mountain State Park. The order's property, which is adjacent to the southern portion of the park, could be sold to The Trust for Public Land, who would then transfer the property to New York State. Park description Hook Mountain State Park is undeveloped, and primarily offers space for passive recreation such as hiking and bird-watching. The Long Path makes its way through the park and passes over Hook Mountain's summit. Although the park is undeveloped, it is functionally part of a larger complex of parks that share continuous borders, including Rockland Lake State Park, Nyack Beach State Park, and Haverstraw Beach State Park, which contain dedicated recreational facilities.

Bellini's only surviving concerto, the piece is also an important part of his limited instrumental output. Performances typically last between seven and eight minutes.  Background  In 1819, at the age of eighteen, Bellini received a scholarship to the Conservatorio di San Sebastiano in Naples. He composed the Oboe Concerto during his studies. Gramophone called the piece \\"a product of his youth\\". Some other works composed by Bellini during the period included sacred music and fifteen symphonies (six of which are lost). In addition, fragments exist for two other concertos for woodwind instruments composed around the time: a bassoon concerto in G major that remains incomplete and a draft for a flute concerto in A major.  Structure and analysis  The work is scored for solo oboe and an orchestra consisting of two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two French horns, and strings. It is in one movement with three distinct sections: *I. Risoluto allegro *II. Larghetto cantabile *III. Allegro polonese The piece is a concerto \\"all'italiana\\", a relatively new form in Bellini's time, which consists of an introduction, a slow section, and an Allegro. The first section, marked Risoluto allegro, is only nine bars long and in the key of G major. It does not develop any melodic material in the rest of the piece, and it consists of a chord progression that makes heavy use of chromatic intervals. Naxos Records referred to it as \\"the shortest of dramatic introductions\\". Charles-David Lehrer opined that the concerto \\"deleted the first movement structure\\", in contrast to previous concerti for the oboe. Lehrer also stated that most pieces without an extensive first movement were labeled as concertinos. The second section, Larghetto Cantabile, marks the first entrance of the oboe and transitions to E-flat major, a major third down from the previous key of G major. In this section, the oboe soloist has several short cadenzas, expressive melodies, and fermata notes. The section can be divided into three subsections. Hyperion Records called the oboe part in the section \\"aria-like\\", stating that it was typical of the bel canto style that was to influence Fr√©d√©ric Chopin. The third and final section, a polonaise marked Allegro, is the largest section of the piece and changes the time signature to 3/4. The section shows a greater amount of interaction between the solo and orchestral parts, as there is frequent imitation and trading off of the main theme. One compiler and publisher of Bellini's music called the section a rondo in the structure \\"ABACABX\\"; he also wrote that \\"the orchestra connects the different episodes by short riffs [‚Ä¶] and replies once the main theme.\\"A. Chegai (edited by), Vincenzo Bellini Composizioni strumentali, vol. XV, Ricordi, Milano, 2008. Lehrer noted this third section as part of the common trend towards polonaises in rondo format as final movements of Romantic oboe concerti, listing it with works by Carl Maria von Weber, Stanislaus Verroust, and Georges Guilhaud.  Reception  Bellini's teacher, Niccol√≤ Antonio Zingarelli. The concerto has often been noted for its operatic qualities and the usage of bel canto themes in the solo oboe part. Valeria Lucentini, in an introduction to an edition of the piece, wrote, \\"Bellini devolves the lively and intense expressiveness of vocal music to the cantabile. As a result, Bellini places particular emphasis on the solo instrument, in effect giving it the same attention as the human voice.\\" She also stated that this characteristic was possibly influenced by some of the wordless songs composed by Bellini's teacher, Niccol√≤ Antonio Zingarelli. Program notes for a United States Military Academy concert wrote that \\"The lyrical writing in the concerto is so indicative of Bellini's style that one could easily believe it to belong to one of Bellini's operas, and yet the work is still thoroughly idiomatic to the oboe.\\" Hyperion Records opined that \\"Bellini's juxtaposition of lyrical and more rigorous passages gives the little work an expertly managed inner balance.\\" Gramophone referred to the concerto as one that \\"extends the past rather than smooths the passage to the twentieth-century revival of the form,\\" contrasting it with Domenico Cimarosa's constructed oboe concerto by Arthur Benjamin as an example of a 20th-century 'revival' of a work that was not originally made.

It consists of a habitation site and mound group with artifacts that date from the Early Woodland Period to the Late Prehistoric Period (1000 BCE‚Äì1700 CE). It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 for having state- level significance in the theme of archaeology. It was nominated for its rare Early Woodland component, Middle Mississippian cultural influences, and potential to show climatic adaptations over time. Archaeological history The site was first surveyed in 1887. At that time 31 conical mounds were recorded, plus traces of four others already obliterated by Euro-American land use. to the west an additional three conical mounds and a linear embankment were recorded in 1887 but had also been obliterated by 1911. In 1947 a researcher excavated a trench through one of the mounds but found nothing. He also noted a ring of rocks that may have marked a dwelling, but that too disappeared in ensuing years. In 1955 researchers from the Science Museum of Minnesota conducted a surface survey. They collected 17 potsherds and seven stone tools (four knives or scrapers, two hammerstones, and a celt). This prompted the museum to return in 1958 for what remains the site's most extensive excavation. They determined that the majority of the site's artifacts dated from the Middle Woodland Period, with rare finds indicating earlier and later occupation as well. This helped establish the probable cultural sequence of the site. Additional excavation took place in 1971. A trench near the center of the mound group yielded a chert blade, three potsherds, and some fire-cracked rocks. Surface collection south of the mounds found additional sherds and 19 lithic flakes. Artifacts All the recovered ceramics were tempered with grit rather than shell. The Early Woodland sherds are similar to pottery found elsewhere within the Upper Mississippi and Ohio River drainage basins. The Middle Woodland pieces are comparable to finds at riverine sites in Southeast Minnesota. The Late Woodland and Mississippian ceramics correlate to the cultural complexes of the Upper and Middle Mississippi River. In addition to the ceramic and lithic finds, fire hearths and refuse pits have also been documented.

The M/S Carolinian was the first entirely-welded commercial vessel in the world. She was completed in March of 1930 in Charleston, South Carolina. Built by Charleston Dry Dock & Machine Company, she was a 226-ton tanker designed for coastal shipping. Miles L. Clark is a known owner, with Texaco as the operator (notice the insignia on her stack prior to launch). The ship took about nine months to complete from the time her keel was laid. As denoted by the prefix M/S, the vessel also had an internal combustion main engine. Welded construction and internal combustion engines are staples in modern shipbuilding, allowing the Carolinian to be the first truly modern merchant ship. Richard F. Smith, the designer, created the lock notch welded system. Charleston Dry Dock & Machine was the sole licensee. The design consisted of steel plates with notches that allowed easy fit-up and welding. Only nine workmen were required to assemble the hull. This design saved one-quarter of the cost, and 85,000-lbs of rivets. The welding required a mere 8,000-lbs of welding wire by comparison. During the shakedown cruise on March 8, she made 11.5 knots heading out to sea, beyond Fort Sumter. The success of the Carolinian's maiden voyage the following month, and two flawless subsequent dry-dock inspections spurred an \\"estimate\\" for six orders of similar ships in 1931.

Turner (1931 - April 9, 1992) was an American administrator who served as Under Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution and General Manager of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (Metro). Turner was the first African-American woman to lead a major public transit agency. Biography Turner was born in Teaneck, New Jersey, the daughter of Carmen Pawley and James Pawley. She grew up in Washington D.C. and in 1968 graduated from Howard University, later earning a master's degree in public administration and political science from American University (1972). She started government service as a typist and rose to acting director of civil rights at the United States Transportation Department. At USDOT, she helped to make it possible for women members of the Coast Guard to be allowed to serve on shipboard. In 1977, Turner became chief of administration at Metro. In May of 1983, she stepped in as acting general manager of Metro and two months later was promoted to general manager. As general manager, Turner won wide praise for running what was then the nation's second-largest rail and fourth- largest bus transit system. She was responsible for 7000 employees and the operation of some 2000 buses and rail cars with a combined ridership of 700,000 a day. During her seven-year tenure at Metro, it underwent major expansion, from 47 to 63 stations. Annual ridership grew to 70 million passengers. In 1988, Metro was named the nation's best public transportation system by the American Public Transit Association. The highlight of Turner's Metro career came in 1990 when Congress authorized $1.3 billion for completing the 103-mile (166 km) system. Turner left Metro in 1990 to become Under Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, with responsibilities similar to a chief operating officer. She died of breast cancer in 1992.

Etymology The word \\"salogon\\" is the combination of the words \\"salog\\" which means \\"river\\" in Bicol language and \\"gogon\\" which is a kind of reef or grass that accordingly thrived much in the place. Actually, Salogon is located near the Rangas River and the gogon grassland. Historical Accounts The potential of barangay Salogon as the strategic place for Partido area was seen by the Spaniards. It is the center of the four towns of Tigaon, Goa, San Jose, and Sag√±ay. It was in fact planned by the Spaniards to make this place as the town center of San Jose. However, the dense population of the place made them decide to transfer the town center to where it is now. The ruins of a church build strongly with concrete foundations may testify to the time when this place was the center of the four towns. However, Strong typhoons caused the destruction of the church located at this barangay. Thus, being situated at the center of the four towns of Partido, Salogon was seen then as an ideal point of defense. The Spaniards build trenches along the eastern portion which was then a good entry point from the Pacific Ocean. Government The elected barangay officials are as follows: Rogelio O.

Education  Henry James Priestley was born in Crouch Hill, London. He was educated at Mill Hill School and Jesus College, University of Cambridge, where he gained his B.A. with honours first class (second division).http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/priestley-henry-james-8115 He was fifth wrangler in the Mathematical Tripos of 1905. In 1909 he received his M.A. from Cambridge.  Career  After graduating from Cambridge, Priestley lectured in mathematics at the Victoria University of Manchester (now University of Manchester) in 1907. He married Margery Hewitt in 1909 in London. In 1910, The University of Queensland, in Brisbane, Australia advertised extensively, four new professor positions in the newly formed University. After Professor Ernest Rutherford of the University of Manchester declined it, Priestley's application was considered and voted favourably upon. Priestley would become Professor of mathematics and physics. He and his wife arrived in Brisbane in 1911, on the same boat as his colleague Professor John Lundie Michie. However Priestley soon realised he couldn't teach all the necessary subjects alone, and so Thomas Parnell, who was teaching at the University of Melbourne, found his application to lecture in physics successful. By 1919 the senate of the University decided to create separate departments of mathematics and physics. Priestley was offered either chair and chose mathematics. Thomas Parnell was offered the physics chair. In 1912 Priestley became a member of the London Mathematical Society and subsequently published papers in its proceedings and in other journals, mainly in the areas of applied mathematics and mathematical physics. He believed the University would not succeed unless its academics published extensively to improve its reputation. Priestley had considerable influence on university affairs, and despaired at the state of the buildings and library. He served as Dean of the Faculty of Science (1911‚Äì19). He was president of the Board of Faculties (later professorial board) (1922‚Äì25) and was a member of many standing committees of the senate and board. He was a keen member of the University Musical Society. He was also a supporter of hockey at the university, his daughter later becoming a member of the women's team. His wife was active in the establishment of the Women's College at the University. A founder of the Queensland branch of the Mathematical Association of Great Britain, Priestley was its president for many years. He was President of the Royal Society of Queensland in 1923. He spoke at lecture tours throughout Queensland, notably on Einstein's theory of relativity. Priestley died on 26 February 1932 of a cerebral tumour after a long illness, survived by his wife, three sons and a daughter. His obituary was given in the newspapers by his colleague, Professor John Lundie Michie. His eldest son Henry Thomas Priestley, was a key advocate for the establishment of Townsville University College (now James Cook University) in 1960.  Legacy  A major building at the University of Queensland bears his name.  References  External links  * C. S.

It is located at 28 kilometers and 15 kilometers by water, away from the Poblacion of San Jose, eight (8) kilometers from barangay Sabang and with a distance of eight (8) kilometers by land. It is bounded on the north by cocoland and northeast by Barangay Ayugao, Presentacion, Camarines Sur where Talidtidon Falls and Kawa Rivers lies. On the west by barangay Maangas, Presentacion, Camarines Sur where Gipangpang River also lies. On the south is barangay Lagha, Presentacion, Camarines Sur. This barangay has the potential in tourism because of a cave with underwater river hidden in a virgin forest. The annual fiesta celebration is on May 15. Etymology The word was derived from a tree called \\"dadiagnao\\" which was used by the people for lighting as torch, also as firewood. During the Spanish time, the Spaniards changed it to \\"Adiagnao\\" due to difficulty of utterance. Historical account This barangay is controversial since it is geographically located in between the barangays of Maangas and Lagha, both of Lagonoy before, and now of Presentacion. Hence, it was then part of Lagonoy but its territorial jurisdiction was eventually transferred to San Jose purposely to provide the then newly established town a forest where it can make use of the resources there such as rattan and firewood. It said that Adiangao was thick with \\"dadiagnao\\", a tree from which \\"salong\\" was taken. The people used this salong as lighting material or torch. It was told by old folks that this barangay was a witness to Moro raids which the people's settlement had been transferred more frequently from the different parts of the place due to these attacks. Now, the present settlement of the people is near the sea making fishing as the main source of livelihood. Geography and demographics The barangay has a total population of 1,997,2016 BCRS Survey 345 households and 782 registered voters. It is located about 28 km. by land or 15 km. by water away from the population of San Jose. It is also 8 km away from barangay Sabang and with a distance also of 8 km away from the municipality of Presentacion when you travel by land. It has 7 purok/zones and a total land area of 400 hectares with rolling agricultural land and forest mountains. It is bounded on the north by cocoland and northeast by barangay Ayugao, Presentacion were the Talidtidon Falls and Kawa River lies. On the west by barangay Maangas, Presentacion where Gipangpang River can be found. On the south is barangay Lagha also of Presentacion. Economic profile Adiangao is basically an agricultural and fishing barangay. Coconut, abaca and tiger grass production are the main livelihood of its residents.

The fans are known as Sherlockians or Holmesians. Many fans of Sherlock Holmes participate in societies around the world, and engage in a variety of activities such as discussion, tourism, and collecting. History Fans of the literary detective Sherlock Holmes are widely considered to have comprised the first modern fandom, holding public demonstrations of mourning after Holmes was \\"killed off\\" in 1893, and creating some of the first fan fiction as early as about 1897 to 1902. Fans often play the Sherlockian game, analyzing the stories under the premise that Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson were real people and Conan Doyle was merely Watson's literary agent. Many authors have authored \\"biographies\\" of Sherlock Holmes such as William S. Baring-Gould's Sherlock Holmes of Baker Street (1962) and Nick Rennison's Sherlock Holmes: The Unauthorized Biography (2005). Various cookbooks with a Victorian era Sherlockian theme have been published over the years. 1976 brought both Dining with Sherlock Holmes: A Baker Street Cookbook by Julia Rosenblatt and Frederic H. Sonnenschmidt as well as Sherlock Holmes Cookbook by Sean M. Wright and John Farrell. The latter two authors have both received investitures in The Baker Street Irregulars. William Bonnell authored The Sherlock Holmes Victorian Cookbook in 1997. Cosplay is often an aspect of Sherlockian fandom with a Sherlock Cosplay World Record attempted at UCL in 2014. Elements of Sherlock Holmes fandom have been explored in non-fiction books such as the 2015 book The Great Detective by Zach Dundas, and the 2017 book From Holmes to Sherlock by Mattias Bostr√∂m. Societies=Overview Organisations have formed all over the world devoted to Sherlock Holmes. There are many Sherlock Holmes societies, though estimates of the number of groups vary; one source published in 1999 states that there are 375 such groups, another source published in 2001 estimates the number of societies is at least 250, and a different source published in 2009 states that there are more than 400 active Sherlock Holmes societies. In many of these groups, members often play the Sherlockian game, analyzing the stories under the premise that Holmes and Watson were real historical people. Members of these societies also participate in many other activities such as discussing adaptations of the stories and organising events. Many Sherlock Holmes groups are based in geographical areas, though these groups often have an online presence. Some groups are based online, such as the longest established online Sherlock Holmes discussion group, the Hounds of the Internet mailing list, which has existed since 1992, and the John H Watson Society, a worldwide online society established in 2013, which was founded mainly by members of existing American Sherlock Holmes societies. North America The oldest Sherlock Holmes society is the Baker Street Irregulars, based in New York. In 1934, Christopher Morley hosted a dinner in New York City in honour of Sherlock Holmes which led to the formation of The Baker Street Irregulars, or BSI. Unlike most Sherlock Holmes societies, membership in The Baker Street Irregulars is by invitation only. Each member receives an \\"investiture\\" or a special title. The Baker Street Irregulars was an all-male group until 1991. Another Sherlock Holmes society based in New York City, The Adventuresses of Sherlock Holmes, or ASH, was founded in the late 1960s and was first led by Evelyn Herzog. It is the oldest women‚Äôs Sherlockian society. The group protested the exclusion of women from the Baker Street Irregulars. In 1991, some Adventuresses were among the first women to be invested as members of the BSI. That year, a few men were given honorary membership in the ASH. Men were admitted to full membership of the ASH in 2008. There are Sherlock Holmes societies located throughout the United States that are \\"scion societies\\" of the Baker Street Irregulars. Membership is open to anyone in many of these groups, for example the Norwegian Explorers of Minnesota, a scion society of the BSI which was founded in 1948. In 1957, together with the Sherlock Holmes Society of London, the Norwegian Explorers unveiled a commemorative plaque for Sherlock Holmes near the Reichenbach Falls in Switzerland. The Bootmakers of Toronto is a Sherlock Holmes society based in Toronto, Canada. The society was established in 1972. The Bimetallic Question, a Sherlock Holmes society based in Montreal, Canada, was founded in 1979. The Bimetallic Question of Montreal, together with the Reichenbach Irregulars of Switzerland, erected a plaque for Sherlock Holmes at the Reichenbach Falls in 1992. There are many other Sherlock Holmes societies in North America, including groups considered to be scion societies of the Baker Street Irregulars as well as other groups. Europe An organisation named the Sherlock Holmes Society was formed in London in 1934, after the formation of The Baker Street Irregulars. It included scholars among its members such as Dorothy L. Sayers and Dick Sheppard. The group was later dissolved due to World War II. The organisation was succeeded by the Sherlock Holmes Society of London, founded in 1951 by a group of five people who organised the Sherlock Holmes exhibition at the 1951 Festival of Britain, including Freda Howlett, who was at one time the last surviving founder; she remained a member until her death nearly seventy years later in 2020 and was once president of the society. One of the other founders was W. T. Williams, and among those present at the first meeting were Guy Warrack, Gerald Kelly, and Winifred Paget, daughter of Sidney Paget. The society's first president was Sydney Castle Roberts. In 1957, the society unveiled a commemorative plaque for Sherlock Holmes near the Reichenbach Falls in Switzerland, together with an American Sherlockian society, the Norwegian Explorers of Minnesota. The London society also unveiled the world's first statue of Sherlock Holmes in Meiringen, Switzerland, near the Reichenbach Falls, in 1988. In 1999, the society's campaign for a Sherlock Holmes statue in London resulted in the unveiling of the statue of Sherlock Holmes in London. The society's events include discussions, lectures, film viewings, and Victorian cricket matches. The society also organises annual outings to areas related to Sherlock Holmes, typically to areas around the UK but also including \\"pilgrimages\\" to the Reichenbach Falls, such as the group's seventh pilgrimage to the Falls, which occurred in 2012. As of 2012, the society has nearly 1,200 full members and more than 200 associate members. Membership is open to anyone. There are also other Sherlock Holmes societies in the UK, such as The Crew of the S.S. May Day, founded in 1992 in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Other Sherlock Holmes societies in the UK include The Deerstalkers of Welshpool, based in Welshpool, Wales and founded in 2001, and the Self- Important Scotland Yarders, the Sherlock Holmes society of Scotland, founded in 2010. The Reichenbach Irregulars, the Sherlock Holmes society of Switzerland, was founded in Meiringen in 1989. In 1992, together with the Bimetallic Question of Montreal, the Reichenbach Irregulars erected a plaque at the Reichenbach Falls commemorating Holmes's defeat of Professor Moriarty. The Hungarian Sherlock Holmes Club was established in 2011 and is based in Budapest, Hungary. Actor L√°szl√≥ Tahi T√≥th, the Hungarian voice of Jeremy Brett for the Hungarian dubbed version of the Granada Sherlock Holmes television series, was once president of the club. Other examples of Sherlock Holmes societies in Europe include the Danish Baker Street Irregulars, founded in 1950, The Baskerville Hall Club of Sweden, founded in 1979, the Soci√©t√© Sherlock Holmes de France (Sherlock Holmes Society of France), founded in 1993, and the Deutsche Sherlock-Holmes-Gesellschaft (German Sherlock Holmes Society), founded in 2010, among many others. Other regions The Japan Sherlock Holmes Club was founded in 1977. This has been described as the largest Sherlock Holmes society, though various sources give greatly different estimates of the number of members, with several but not all sources giving estimates of around one thousand. Roger Johnson, a recipient of an investiture in the BSI and the ASH, wrote in 2018 that of the Sherlock Holmes societies around the world, the Sherlock Holmes Society of London and the Japan Sherlock Holmes Club \\"probably have the largest membership, with well over a thousand members each\\". Members of the Japan Sherlock Holmes Club wrote a book on Sherlock Holmes which was published in 1987. The club commissioned a statue of Sherlock Holmes in Karuizawa, Japan, in 1988. There are other Sherlock Holmes societies around the world, including The Sydney Passengers, founded in Sydney, Australia in 1985, and the Sherlock Holmes Society of India, founded in 2001, in addition to other societies. Fan sites and podcasts As of 2009, there are several major websites devoted to Sherlock Holmes such as Sherlockian.net, The Best of Sherlock Holmes, Camden House, and others. Sherlockian.net was established in 1994 as the first online resource for information about Sherlock Holmes. The website The Best of Sherlock Holmes contains information about items related to Sherlock Holmes and Arthur Conan Doyle, and includes \\"best\\" lists such as a list of the best Sherlock Holmes stories. Camden House is an online collection of Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories and the illustrations which were originally published with the stories in magazines. Some Sherlock Holmes societies such as the Sherlock Holmes Society of London also have websites with resources and information related to Sherlock Holmes.

Thousands of fans of Sherlock Holmes visit the Sherlock Holmes Museum each year. The museum officially has the address of Holmes's residence, 221B Baker Street. There is also a pub in London named The Sherlock Holmes, which is decorated with objects and photographs of Sherlock Holmes characters. It is located in Charing Cross. A statue of Sherlock Holmes is located outside Baker Street tube station in London, and was unveiled in 1999. Tours for fans of Sherlock Holmes are offered in Dartmoor, an area in southwest England which serves as the setting for much of Arthur Conan Doyle's novel The Hound of the Baskervilles. Another place associated with Sherlock Holmes that fans can tour is Undershaw, which was once the home of Arthur Conan Doyle and is located in southeast England. A statue of Sherlock Holmes, sculpted by Gerald Laing, was installed in 1989 in Edinburgh, Scotland, near Arthur Conan Doyle's birthplace. Many fans have made a \\"pilgrimage\\" to Meiringen, Switzerland, and the nearby Reichenbach Falls, where Holmes has his final showdown with Professor Moriarty in Doyle's short story \\"The Final Problem\\". The Sherlock Holmes Society of London has organised group trips to the Reichenbach Falls intermittently since 1968. There is also a Sherlock Holmes museum in Meiringen, and another Sherlock Holmes museum in Lucens, Switzerland. The world's first statue of Sherlock Holmes was unveiled in Meiringen in September 1988, by the Sherlock Holmes Society of London, which also unveiled the statue in London in 1999. John Doubleday sculpted both of these statues. The world's second statue of Sherlock Holmes was erected in October 1988 in Karuizawa, Japan, by the Japan Sherlock Holmes Club, to commemorate Ken Nobuhara, who was the first to translate all the stories into Japanese. The statue was sculpted by Yoshinori Satoh, and has become well-known since it is mentioned in many of the local guidebooks for tourists. A sculpture depicting both Holmes and Watson was unveiled in Moscow, Russia, in 2007. It is located outside the British embassy. The figures were based on both Sidney Paget's illustrations and the portrayals of the characters by actors Vasily Livanov and Vitaly Solomin, who played Holmes and Watson respectively in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. Livanov helped design the monument. In 2019, a statue of Holmes titled \\"Sherlock & Segar\\" was unveiled in Chester, Illinois, United States, as part of the Popeye & Friends Character Trail, a series of statues honouring the work of American cartoonist E. C. Segar. The face of the sculpture was based on that of Segar himself. The statue was erected as a tribute to Segar and his \\"compelling interest in the master detective\\", according to the inscription on the statue. Collections Some fans of Sherlock Holmes are collectors. Such collectors often have wide-ranging collections of books and objects related to Sherlock Holmes, though some only collect specific items such as first editions or foreign language translations of Holmes stories. For stamp collectors, there are Holmesian stamps from the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and other countries and territories, and for coin collectors, there are Holmesian coins from Gibraltar and the Cook Islands. Noted Sherlockian John Bennett Shaw, who received an investiture in the The Baker Street Irregulars, at one time amassed the largest collection of Sherlock Holmes items in the world, including books, recordings, advertising, and other memorabilia. Shaw compiled a list of 100 books, pamphlets, and periodicals essential for Sherlockian study entitled The Basic Holmesian Library. Shaw's collection was bequeathed to the University of Minnesota upon his death in 1994. The university had already housed the largest public Sherlock Holmes collection. In 1995, Shaw‚Äôs collection was formally dedicated at the University of Minnesota. As of 2015, the University of Minnesota's Sherlock Holmes Collections constitute the world's largest archive of Sherlock Holmes materials, containing over 60,000 items. The collection includes objects related to Arthur Conan Doyle, and is generally not displayed. One of the largest collections of Sherlock Holmes items is the Arthur Conan Doyle Collection at the Toronto Reference Library in Canada. The collection started in 1969 when the library purchased a large number of books from the estate of a private collector, and is displayed in a room styled after the study of Holmes's fictional Baker Street residence. The collection consists of more than 25,000 items, including materials related to Arthur Conan Doyle. During his lifetime, Richard Lancelyn Green gathered a large Sherlock Holmes collection, which was bequeathed to the Portsmouth City Museum in Portsmouth, England. There is also a large collection of Sherlock Holmes memorabilia displayed in the London pub The Sherlock Holmes.

It was designed by Herbert Stuart-Nairne and built in 1957. It is also known as The Strand Cafe/Restaurant. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 July 2000.  History  The former 4BU building was constructed in 1957 to a design by architect, Herbert Stuart-Nairne. Following a meeting in April 1935 at the offices of Wyper Bros. Ltd, the company of Bundaberg Broadcasters Pty Ltd was incorporated on 24 July in the same year. Broadcasting commenced on 16 December 1935, with a complement of seven advertisers and a PMG licence at a cost of . The chairman of directors, Mr W Harvey, along with the co-directors, Colonel Christensen and Mr R Curtis, adhered strictly to a policy catering for all tastes in entertainment. The transmitter and studio equipment were purchased for just over . The studios of 4BU were located in a building leased from Wyper Bros. Ltd. During World War II, regular programs for Bundaberg and district troops in New Guinea and adjacent islands were provided. In 1938, two acres of land was purchased at Kalkie for a fee of . Later that year a further area was purchased so that Bundaberg Broadcasters Pty Ltd could install an antenna, having received consent to increase power from 200 to 500 watts. This consent was given in 1937, a small fibro cottage was supplied for the engineer so that he could live on site and be on call should problems occur. During the 1930s and for many years broadcasting consisted of live stage plays, revues and concerts. The new transmitter station opened at Kalkie in June 1938. In 1941, the lease for the studios was extended for a further three years and in May of that year the old piping was dismantled. Until 1939, power for transmitting was supplied by a generator owned by Bundaberg Broadcasters Pty Ltd. It was not until 25 May 1939 that power was connected to the Kalkie site from the city electricity supply. In December 1943, a further lease and an offer to purchase was placed on the studios. This building was known as \\"The Radio Building\\". As the industry of the wireless grew so 4BU followed suit. Prior to having their building constructed, 4BU rented premises from the Bundaberg City Council. With an ever-increasing listening audience and updates in technology, Bundaberg Broadcasters decided to construct a new building. Designed by Herbert Stewart-Narine, who had also designed other Bundaberg buildings, including the fire station, the building was opened in 1957. Stuart-Nairne incorporated a number of very distinctive elements associated with 1950s architecture. Like many similar designs, both non-domestic and domestic, the building was designed with a flat roof, a distinct 1950s departure from the domination of buildings by roof forms. Brisbane architects, Hayes and Scott produced many houses that experimented with the composition of windows, fine detailing of glass up to roof line and exaggerated projection of roof line, to heighten the illusion of the flat roof floating. By 1948, the initial problems of gaining the confidence of builders had been solved, consequently, this paved the way for interesting variations of ceiling forms during the 1950s. Stuart-Nairne's use of floor to ceiling glass in the design of the former 4BU radio station is architecturally typical of this era. The former 4BU radio station demonstrates the rediscovery of texture in the 1950s. Materials composed as textural decoration included using colour, art works, sunshading devices, grids, patterns and fragmented building components. Decorative, textural detail extant in the former 4BU radio station include the interior decorative features, particularly the undulating ceiling and geometric wall treatments in the former recording suites and the timber sunshading features on the western side of the building. The decorative elements epitomise the use of rationalised ornamentation incorporating a sense of logic so archetypal of the 1950s. In 1993, Bundaberg Broadcasters Pty Ltd were granted and introduced FM sound to Bundaberg. Known as HitzFM it was a very popular service, particularly with the younger members of the community. Once again, with updated technology and an increasing need for more space, Bundaberg Broadcasters moved from the Woongarra Street site to its current location in Crofton Street in 1992. The former 4BU radio station now houses a licensed cafe and restaurant.  Description  The former 4BU radio station is a two- storey brick building with a flat roof. The building has floor to ceiling glass panels located in the front or southern facade and the western and eastern facade. The entrance doors, timber framed with glass panels and decorative, geometrically shaped handles, lead to the ground floor. As the building now functions as a cafe and restaurant, much of the ground floor has been fitted out with stainless steel preparation and cooking facilities. The safe is located in its original position on the western side of the building. A large, sweeping staircase, with original timber and metal handrail and balustrading leads to the first floor. The metal balustrading curves around and encloses the entire south eastern corner of the first floor. Adjacent to the staircase, along the western wall of the building, is a large group of floor to ceiling windows finished with original timber sunshading detail. Original concentric circle, metal light fittings are located on the first floor. An original timber door with glass panel and louvred vents is located in the north-west corner of the first floor, and opens to an unoccupied room. On the door is painted the words \\"White Lotus Studio\\", providing evidence of its former use when Bundaberg Broadcasters occupied the building. Centrally located, at the rear of the northern end of the first floor are double doors with timber frames and glass panels, opening to a small foyer. Opening from this foyer are three original timber doors with soundproofing features. These doors open to the highly intact former recording studios. One room in the north-east corner is the most decorative and has a ribbed, undulating ceiling and timber geometric wall design which runs the length of the walls. The studio in the north-western corner has decorative wall and ceiling elements incorporating a \\"staggered\\" design. In each room, windows provide views to the adjacent studio. The garage is located to the rear of the building and the brickwork on the western wall incorporates a decorative geometric design.  Heritage listing  The former 4BU Radio Station was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 July 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. With its flat roof, floor to ceiling glass and highly intact interior decorative features, particularly ceiling and wall treatments in the former recording suites, as well as original timber and glass entrance doors, windows with timber sunshading features on the western side of the building, original stairwell with balustrading and light fittings, original timber and glass doors to both the main entrance and the entrance to the \\"White Lotus Room\\" recording suite, the former 4BU radio station is most significant as an excellent, intact example of commercial 1950s architecture. A purpose built radio station, the building is significant for its association with Bundaberg Broadcasters, who have operated in the area for over 65 years, including broadcasting to troops in New Guinea during World War II. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The former 4BU radio station is most significant as an excellent, intact example of commercial 1950s architecture. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The former 4BU radio station is most significant as an excellent, intact example of commercial 1950s architecture.

He studied painting, sculpture and printing in Beirut (at the Lebanese Academy of Fine Arts) and Rome (at the Academia di Belle Arti). He lived between these two cities between 1973 and 1986. In Rome, he did advanced research on Arabic cultural heritage and on Egypt. He went back to Lebanon in 1986 where he taught sculpture and engraving at the Institute of Fine Arts of the Lebanese University and, from 1958 to 1962, at the Lebanese Academy of Fine Arts. He has been exhibiting in Europe since 1965. His art has been showcased at the British Museum, the Venice Biennale and Tokyo's Ueno Museum. Life and work Hussein Madi, Brown Bird, 22√ó23 cm, 2014 Born in Keserwan District, Lebanon, Madi's body of works is often said to relate to modern European artists like Matisse and Picasso as well as the abstract designs of Islamic art. Madi outlines a silhouette of woman on the entire surface of the canvas with quick strokes of his large brush. His paintings are often based on interplays between straight and curved lines. The features of his characters are those of the Oriental man clearly showing his cultural heritage. In their attitudes, two expressions are found: a static one which shows permanence in the face of the transitory, and the deep Oriental faith in immortality and eternal rest, and also a facial expression of cruel irony, playing the part of the mask in the Greek tragedy or an expression of suffering through stiff posture, like the loud outburst of a horrible cry, the terrible roar of the Assyrian lioness dragging along her crushed rump. This rending roar personifies the cry of Humanity. The Italian critic Joseph Silvaggi writes about Madi: \\"His drawings are filled with symbols and rich with artistic conventions in simplified forms; they are an enchanted script, a r√©sum√© of figurative art, the art of modern man.\\" Awards Madi has won several prizes: the Sursock Museum 5th Salon Prize for Painting (1965‚Äì66), the 8th Salon's Prize for Sculpture offered by the Italian Cultural Centre in 1968/69 and the First Prize for Engraving, Citta di Lecce, Italy (1974).

History The earliest record of Kannada missionaries preaching in the Bangalore Petah area is in 1822. These missionaries were from the Wesleyan Mission and London Missionary Society. They started schools around the petah in 1825. The church has its origin at the Wesleyan Mission School with a chapel in its premises, which existed between 1840 and 1849. The Wesleyan pastors who were active at this time were John Garret (who translated the Bhagavad Gita into Canarese), Edward Hardy, John Gastec, Philip Webber and Daniel Sanderson (who along with Rev. Reeve of the LMS, compiled the first English Canarese dictionary). During this time Kannada church services were help at the Wesleyan Mission School and the chapel. Records of baptisms in this period exists at the Hudson Memorial Church. In 1857, the first native Kannada preachers joined the Wesleyan Mission, with the first pastor being Andrew Philip. Bangalore, South India, 1898, Rough Map by Rev. T E Slater of LMS showing the location of the Wesleyan Canarese Chapel The church's predecessor was the Wesleyan Mission Canarese Chapel (not to be confused with the London Missionary Society Canarese Chapel, now Rice Memorial Church on Avenue Road), which was established in 1859 at Gaanigarapet (now Nagarethpet). Prior to that the site was used as a Wayside Chapel from 1856 to 1859. The chapel was built in a narrow street of Gaanigarapet or Main Street, which is the present Nagarethpet. The chapel was surrounded by Gangamma Halli, Ballapuradapete, Potter's Street and Chakkaliyarugala Halli. Known by the natives as Gudi Hatti or Peta Chapel, the church faced much opposition from the locals, and often church services had to be conducted with police protection. The chapel was used for nearly 45 years. The pastors who served the Peta Chapel were Robert William Faradize, Abijah Samuel, Josiah Hudson, J A Vanes and T Luke. Of these Josiah Hudson was a prominent Weslyan pastor, who has local pastors Samuel Abijah and T Luke serving under him. By 1904, the small chapel could not accommodate its 250 members and hence a need rose to build a new bigger church. In 1900, Rev J A Vanes, a Wesleyan missionary of the purchased the present church land, and a new stone church building was constructed and named after Rev. Josiah Hudson, a Wesleyan missionary and pastor of the Canarse chapel, who helped start many schools in the Bangalore Pete area (not to be confused with Thomas Hodson, another Wesleyan Missionary who helped establish the first Wesleyan Canarese Chapel in 1856). Wesleyan Canarese Mission A Bazar, or Shop, in One of the Principal Streets of Bangalore (p.97, 1856) According to William Arthur (an Irishman, after whom the William Arthur Memorial Church at Goobie is named after), the Wesleyan Canarese Mission was located in the Bangalore Petah, at about 3 miles from the Wesleyan Tamil Mission house. The land for the Wesleyan Canarese Mission was obtained by Thomas Hodson, and was located just outside one of the town gates. Initially, it was a school with a school room which served as the residence of the school master. The school provided English education and considerable number of students were enrolled. Thereafter Mr. Webber was sent to this mission. In 1840, Garrett and Jenkins were appointed as Wesleyan Canarese missionaries, with an authority to build a printing press and a mission-house. Thus was established the Wesleyan Mission Press, with the funding coming from English gentry. The missionaries started to preach in the streets of the petah in the early hours of the day. The sermon was simple Christian concepts such as unity of God, atonement of Christ, etc. Wesleyan Wayside Canarese Chapel, 1856 Thomas Hodson in 1856, describes Bangalore as consisting of two parts - the Cantonment where the soldiers lived and Tamil was primarily spoken, and the Old Town (Petah) where Canarese was the main language. In both parts a total of 130,000 Indians lived. Further he describes the shops of the Bangalore petah, with mud being used for the walls and the floor, wooden pillars and clay used for flat roofs. There were no windows or any protection from the dust, with a mat from the rooftop for shade. At night, the shops were secured by wooden shutters. The shop-keeper sat on the floor of the shop, or on one of the lower shelves. The traders were cloth merchants, grocers, gold smiths, etc. The shops sold sugarcane, coconut, bananas, rice, sweets which were hung on a string and various grains which were kept in baskets with were smeared with cow-dung. Water carriers carrying water was a common site. There were thousands of monkeys which created mischief, but were unharmed by the natives due to their religious beliefs. Wesleyan Wayside Canarese Chapel at the Bangalore Petah (1856) Further, according to Thomas Hodson, the Cantonment had a Wesleyan Chapel for Tamil and English services (the current Wesley Tamil Church, Haines Road, Fraser Town, and East Parade Church, M G Road). The old town was surrounded by a wall (Bangalore Fort), with a moat which was dry and full of trees and thorny shrubs. The Wesleyan Canarese missionaries just lived outside the walls, near the town gates. Here they had a printing press where tracks, scriptures were prepared in Canarese. The premises also had a native school for boys and young men. A room in the end of the school was set aside for Christian worship. The Wesleyan missionaries wanted to build a chapel, but had difficulty finding a suitable plot for the building. Hence, they preached on the streets on the street corners. They finally managed to buy an old dwelling by public auction in 1856, which had its front walls knocked off and some alterations made. This served as a wayside preaching chapel. It had 2 rooms, where 80 children were taught to read and write Canarese. So the chapel also served as a school. Thrice a week, missionaries preached from this wayside chapel, which attracted a crowd of 80-100 people who stood on the street to listen, while the children stayed inside the building, behind the preacher. The sketch of the Wesleyan Wayside Canarese Chapel appeared in the July 1857 issue of the 'Wesleyan Juvenile Offering' magazine. Canarese Wesleyan Chapel, 1859 Wesleyan Village Chapel and School Near Bangalore by Thomas Hodson (1859) New Canarese Wesleyan Chapel, Bangalore (January 1860, p.2, XVII) - Copy.jpg Writing on 24 November 1858, Sarah Sanderson (wife of Rev. Daniel Sanderson), describes the Wesleyan Mission School and Chapel in a Pariah village near the Bangalore Petah. The article also carried a sketch of the same, by Thomas Hodson. The Mission School and Chapel was raised by contributions from women of Hammersmith and Brentford, sent through Ms. E Farmer, contributions totaling to ¬£12 or BINR 150. This school had some 30 children, 22 boys and 8 girls. They were taught by John a native catechist. Divine services were held on Sundays in Canarese at 7:30AM. The congregation consisted of 8-10 men and 25-30 children, and many others listening from outside the door. However, most seemed to attend out of curiosity of seeing the European ladies and men. The church services commenced by ringing the bell. Further, she describes the social scorn and humiliation suffered by the Pariah community and how the church was helping them to gain confidence and dignity by providing education. Further, Sarah Sanderson, writing on 24 September 1859, describes the pettah as the native town of Bangalore with a population of about 60,000. The petah now had 2 Christian churches, one was the London Mission Canarese Chapel (now Rice Memorial Church on Avenue Road) and the other was the Canarese Wesleyan Chapel opened a few months before September 1859. To the left of the Wesleyan Chapel was a low building, which had been altered and white-washed to serve as a school. The cost of building the chapel and vestries behind and the altering the building to the left all cost ¬£460. Except for ¬£11.10s which was donated by sponsors from Leeds, the rest of the funds came out of profits of the printing press. The chapel did not have pews or a gallery. The floor was covered with bamboo matting, and there were rows of benches with seats of fancy cane-work (or rattan). 8 oil lamps using coconut oil were suspended from the ceiling to be used to lighting in the evenings. The windows which were generally kept open had iron bars to keep out the monkeys. Further, she says that her children liked walking the busy streets of the pettah to reach the chapel along with their father. Sarah describes some events such as a postman walking up to the pulpit to deliver a letter to the preacher in the middle of his sermon on a Sunday. Another, when the Muslim mourning of 'Moharrum' was being observed when she attended church one evening. The people used to walk in and out of the chapel as they pleased. All so different from the quiet atmosphere of any Wesleyan Chapel in England. Hudson Memorial, 1904 Hudson Memorial seen behind the Memorial Obelisk raised for the Men who fell in the Siege of Bangalore, 1791. (The memorial was vandalised on 28 October 1964) The congregation of the Canarese Wesleyan Chapel soon grew to 250, and the present building was congested. Hence a need rose to look for a large plot of land to build a bigger church. At the time, a certain Dr. Aayachamma who was related to Dr. Arokyam Pillay, sold the land of present church to Rev J A Vanes on 19 January 1900, for INR 2000. The church was consecrated on 23 September 1904, Friday 4PM, in memory of the Josiah Hudson by his daughter Mrs. Thorp from Mysore. The first service was conducted by Hudson's son-in-law W H Throp. The first sermon was delivered by Rev E P Rice of the London Missionary Society, under the header 'Put off thy shoes form thy feet for the place where thou standest is a holy ground'. The consecration service was attended by around 600 people, and offering of INR 400 was collected. A public meeting was presided by D A Rees of the Wesleyan Mission. G W Sawday and T Luke addressed the gathering in Canarese and H Guildford in English. The events were closed with a prayer in Tamil by Fred Goodwill. The cost of building the church was INR 25000, raised by contributions. The Century Fund Movement contributed INR 5276, Christians from the province INR 528, missionaries and friends INR 4429, The Maharani of Mysore contributed INR300 and the Dewan of Mysore INR200. Architecture The church is stone building in the Gothic architecture with no intervening pillars. The building could now hold 500 people. The architect of the building was J H Stephen, who also donated the circular glass over the door. The communion table, pulpit, reading desk chairs were carved from teak at the Industrial School at Karur. The marble floor of the chancel was donated in the memory of Mrs. Vanes. An anonymous donor contributed towards the church bell. The pipe organ was donated by Mr. Darling. The Bible and hymn books were donated by Mr. and Mrs. Throp. At that time, the land was surrounded by fields, gardens and ponds, and the Gothic structure in midst of these was an imposing view. The church has 9 faces and opening. The altar can be seen from anywhere inside the church. The podium is raised above the road level using a ramp and steps. A mural of 9.7m x 14.5 depicts the nativity scene in Jerusalem. Restoration The church underwent extensive restoration at around the year 2000. The restoration work was conducted under the Chairmanship of then Presbyter in charge Late. Rev. P. K. Simon John & also is recorded by Late Ronnie Johnson, as appeared on his blog, in form of many photos taken during the restoration. 110 Years Celebrations The Hudson Memorial Church, Bangalore, celebrated its 110 years on 23 September 2013. The Chief Minister of Karnataka Siddaramaiah and the Home Mister K J George were supposed to be attendance, however could not make it. On this occasion, several people travelled from far to be a part of this ceremony. M S Ramanujan, the Chief Post Master General, Karnataka Circle, released a stamp to commemorate the 110 years of the church. Events such as Ikebana, painting and choreography were held. Meritorious students from the church were given scholarships and awards. Controversies In 2011, the Deccan Herald reported that a police complaint had been filed in the Ulsoor Gate Police Station, against the secretary, pastorate committee members and management committee members of the Hudson Memorial Church, alleging breach of trust leading to financial losses for the church. In 2010, a cheating case was registered in the same police station against a church member for alleged cheating.

More than 540 mineral deposits of gold, copper, zinc, lead and other minerals have been identified, explored and mined. During 2012, the mining and quarrying sector's contribution to GDP was around 7.0%; during this reporting year the FDI in the mineral sector was of the order of US$662.5 million out of a total trade of $4.7 billion in the country. Laos is now a member of the WTO. History It was only after 2003 that the importance of mining was recognized in Laos when the first mining project, the Sepon Mine was established. There were 127 domestic and foreign companies in 2008 working 213 projects covering prospecting, exploration and feasibility studies period. Geological survey maps related to the mining sector are of 1964 prepared by France and updated during the 1990s and these cover only 54.86% of the country (236,800 km2). The Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment has been delegated the powers to create a geologic database for effective management of mining projects including its exploration. Production and impact As of 2009 the reserves of gold, copper and zinc were assessed at about 500 to 600 tons, 8 to 10 million tons, and 2 to 3 million tons respectively. In 2009 there were about 35 working mines including the Sepon and Phubia mines. The impact of FDI is on export promotion as the domestic consumption of minerals within Laos is limited. According to the International Council on Mining and Metals, as of 2011, the mining sector has accounted for 12% of government revenues and 10% of national income with 80% of foreign direct investment. Mining exports contributed 45% of the total exports of the country. In particular, the Sepon mine and the Phu Kham mine have contributed to 90% of the total mining production in the country. Legal framework The laws in force are of two types, the national mining laws and the investment promotion laws under the New Economic Mechanism (NEM) introduced in 1986. The national Mining Law which is effective since April 1997 is aimed at management including quality control of conservation, exploration, mining and processing of minerals for both local use and for exports, apart from its use in industries. This law is under revision and the draft prepared in 2008 is under consideration of the National Assembly. The investment law related to FDI was introduced in 1988 which has undergone revision in 2004 and 2008. Under the mining law in force licenses are awarded to develop mineral projects with the Department of Mines authorized to issue such licenses. Commodities Bauxite and Alumina are extracted from the Bolaven Plateau jointly with firms from Australia and China. Copper, gold, and silver are being extracted by the MMG Ltd in the Sepon mine and PanAust Ltd in the Phu Kham mine. Zinc, potash and cement production have also been recorded during 2012. Overview Following the signing of the WTO agreement, Laos's investments in the mining sector were expected to rise with increased production of copper, gold, and silver. This list of mines in Laos is subsidiary to the list of mines article and lists working, defunct and future mines in the country and is organised by the primary mineral output. For practical purposes stone, marble and other quarries may be included in this list.

The owner of the house introduces himself as Publius Quintilius Rufus, pro consul of the emperor in Syria, and offers them a contract to put on a series of spectacles at the court of queen Moluya of Arbela. Arbela is now a neutral kingdom between Roman territory and Parthia, Rome's bitterest enemies, and queen Moluya's prime minister has concluded a pact with the Parthian king to allow his armies to pass across the frontier. One of Publius's men, Centurion Marcus Glaucus, unknown to the Parthians, will accompany them officially as the eleventh gladiator to the capital city so he can find out exactly what the situation there is. The ten gladiators, whose loyalty is without question, accept the job and agree to leave for Arbela at daybreak.

S.\\" Price (1874 ‚Äì 1950) was an American expressionist painter from Oregon. Biography Price was born on May 11, 1874 near Bedford, Iowa, and raised on farms and ranches there and in Wyoming and Alberta, Canada. In 1905, a local rancher loaned Price money so he could attend the St. Louis Museum School of Fine Arts. An online facsimile of the entire text of Vol. 1 is posted on the Traditional Fine Arts Organization website (http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/10aa/10aa557.htm ). Price attended the school during the 1905‚Äì1906 academic year; it would be his only formal training. In 1909, Price moved to Portland, Oregon to work as an illustrator for The Pacific Monthly magazine. Price's illustrations of the magazine's Western stories were reminiscent of the work of Charles Marion Russell. Price left Portland in 1910, painting and working for room and board on the farms and ranches of his siblings in British Columbia and California for the next eight years. Price visited Monterey, California in 1918. Price returned to Portland in 1929. During the 1930s, Price completed a series of large paintings as part of the Public Works of Art Project and the Federal Art Project. These works currently are displayed in Timberline Lodge, the Multnomah County Library, Pendleton High School, and the Portland Art Museum. He died on May 1, 1950. Price's long tenure in the San Francisco Bay Area and on the Monterey Peninsula had the most profound impact on the development of his art. He visited San Francisco for the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in the spring of 1915 and decided to stay. The following January he displayed two \\"remarkable\\" studies of domestic animals at the Exhibition of California Artists at the Memorial Museum.San Francisco Chronicle: 22 January 1916, p. 8; 23 January 1916, p.49. This was soon followed by an exhibit of \\"pastoral scenes\\" at Helgesen's Gallery. From 1917 to 1920 he studied as an occasional student at the California School of Fine Arts (today's San Francisco Art Institute) under Pedro Joseph de Lemos, Lee F. Randolph and Frank van Sloun, and was awarded a second prize at the school's annual exhibit in 1920. According to the U.S. Census that year he was unmarried and resided in San Francisco near his mentor and teacher, the renowned artist Gottardo Piazzoni.U.S. Census of 1920 (January), ED95, Sheet 19A. By 1921 he was sharing a Monterey studio and residential address with artist William Gaskin and the Fauvist painter August Gay, a member of the Society of Six, at the old French Hotel, known as the Stevenson House. Price was first described as a very quiet \\"Bible-reading man\\" who painted illustrative cowboy scenes. He earned money by working at the local cannery and making picture frames.The Oakland Tribune, 25 June 1922, p. S-59.Monterey Peninsula Herald, 31 October 1950, p. A-12. He studied with the popular Post-Impressionist painter Armin Hansen. In April 1922 he was one of three Monterey artists invited by Pedro Joseph de Lemos to exhibit at Stanford University, where, according to one critic, his ten displayed works were reminiscent of Frederic Remington. Shortly thereafter he exhibited at the: Del Monte Art Gallery (Monterey); Carmel Arts and Crafts Club; and California Gallery of American Art (San Francisco). By 1924 his art had changed radically and the press now described his works as having simplified compositions, blocks of either crude or harmonious colors, and juxtaposed planes that rendered distorted perspectives.San Francisco Chronicle, 7 December 1924, p. D-7. His art was attracting wealthy buyers. At this time he was in a very public and romantic relationship with the artist Ina Perham. In the summer of 1925 his decidedly Expressionist canvases, along with his earlier paintings, were given a one-man show at San Francisco's Galerie des Beaux Arts. When critics evaluated his new works, they called him a \\"colorist\\" with no interest in drawing, but they also claimed that he \\"set a high mark for Modernists.\\"The Oakland Tribune, 20 September 1925, p.6-S.San Francisco Chronicle, 20 September 1925, p.D-3. His huge scaled model of the town of \\"old Monterey\\" was displayed on the Peninsula. In 1927 Price spent so much time in Berkeley and contributed to so many exhibits in the University town that he became a cult figure in the local art colony. That January his one-month show at the Berkeley League of Fine Arts attracted so much interest and so many students that it was extended into April; critics were enthralled by his purity, rhythm and progressive forms. Ten of Hansen's most reformist students formed the somewhat amorphous \\"Monterey Group,\\" which included Price and Perham, and in May 1927 staged a highly publicized exhibit at the Galerie des Beaux Arts. Although much of the exhibit was panned, Price's canvas entitled Ploughing was called \\"quite an achievement.\\"The Argus (San Francisco, CA), June 1927, p. 1.The Oakland Tribune, 15 May 1927, p.8-B. That summer a jury accepted his art for the exhibit at the California State Fair. Although he moved to Portland in 1929 he maintained an active schedule of exhibitions in northern California. Style and collections His style grew throughout his life, moving through impressionism to expressionism. According to The Oregon Encyclopedia: \\"C.S. Price may be Oregon's most important and influential painter...[He] was nationally known in the 1940s.\\" Price's work can be found in the Northwest Collection of the Hallie Ford Museum of Art in Salem, Oregon.

In Russian fandom, the trope is known under the term \\"popadantsy\\", plural form for \\"popadanets\\", female: \\"popadanka\\",Challenges in Strategic Communication and Fighting Propaganda in Eastern Europe: Solutions for a Future Common Project, p. 46 a person who accidentally finds himself elsewhere/elsewhen.Note: Popadanets is a Russian neologism derived from the verb \\"popast\\", \\"to get/land into (smth)\\". The Russian term bears ironical flavor, because popadantsy has become a widespread cliche in Russian pulp science fiction.\\"–ü–û–ü–ê–î–ê–ù–¶–´: –®–¢–ê–ú–ü–´ –ò –û–¢–ö–†–´–¢–ò–Ø\\", Boris Nevsky, Mir Fantastiki (\\"World of Science Fiction\\"), no.109; September 2012. Russian critic Boris Nevsky traces this plot device to at least Gulliver's Travels (18th century). In Japanese fiction, the genre of accidental transport into a parallel universe or fantasy world is known as isekai. Types The accidental time travel trope is known as time slip. A classical example of time slip is Mark Twain's A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (19th century), which had considerable influence on later writers. Other kinds of accidental travel include space travel (e.g., through accidental wormholes, portals (portal fantasy) or other spatial irregularities, or a catastrophic spatial event), travel to an alternative universe, an RPG universe (litRPG), or into an alternative history. An early example of catastrophic space travel is Hector Servadac (1877) by Jules Verne, where a piece of the Earth with several Earthlings is ripped off by a comet. In Les Robinsons du Cosmos (') (1955) by Francis Carsac, pieces of France and the US with plenty of population are ripped off and planted on an alien planet during a galactic collision. In 1912 Edgar Rice Burroughs invented John Carter of Mars, who lands on Mars from a sacred cave where he was hiding from the Apaches. Still another way to land somewhere is to be abducted/invited by aliens to live in an advanced star-faring civilization. Common cliches include becoming a slave, or a warrior, or a dying person getting a second chance, with the subsequent social advance. A particular kind of effortless accidental travel is finding oneself elsewhere/elsewhen occupying someone's else mind, via body swap (mind swap) or mind/body sharing. Carsac wrote the story with the trick of this type as well: in Terre en fuite (1960) a scientist hit by lightning suddenly becomes a genius and before his death he reveals that his mind melded with the mind of a scientist from far future. However most of the novel is the description of the future of the Earth expecting the Sun to turn supernova. In Russian fiction Around the break of the millennium popadantsy gained an immense popularity in Russian science fiction and fantasy. Responding to the demand, the supply of the novels of this type skyrocketed, with an inevitable drop of the overall quality and degeneration of the inventiveness of the writers into a series of cliches.\\"–ö–Ω–∏–≥–∏ –ø—Ä–æ –ø–æ–ø–∞–¥–∞–Ω—Ü–µ–≤: –ø—Ä–æ–±–ª–µ–º—ã –∏ —à—Ç–∞–º–ø—ã\\" A significant number of popadantsy occur at a key moment in the Russian past. Armed with modern knowledge, they turn the tide to the glory of the Motherland, i.e., a popadanets becomes a progressor, creating an alternative history. It was suggested that this phenomenon of Russian science fiction is characterized by two motivations: \\"Mary Sue\\"-type drive to self-fulfillment and patriotic nostalgy over the times of Soviet superpower (Communist nostalgia).–ú–∞—Ä—à ¬´–ø–æ–ø–∞–¥–∞–Ω—Ü–µ–≤¬ª, –∏–ª–∏ –ù–æ—Å—Ç–∞–ª—å–≥–∏—è –ø–æ –∞–ª—å—Ç–µ—Ä–Ω–∞—Ç–∏–≤–µ , Pavel Vinogradov, Literaturnaya Gazeta, No. 13 (6316), April 6, 2011\\"–ü–æ–ø–∞–¥–∞–Ω—Ü—ã —É –°—Ç–∞–ª–∏–Ω–∞\\" (\\"Popadantsy Visiting Stalin\\"), Sergey Lukyanenko, Izvestiya, May 26, 2010 A typical Russian popadanets is one of the three types: an everyman, a commando, or a reenactor, with all undergoing a social lift after travel. While a Russian popadanets used to be a male, since 2000s a flood of pulp fiction emerged featuring female popadanka hero, typically in the form of romance fiction, where popadanka becomes a mighty sorceress or becomes a bride of a mighty man: a king, a sorcerer, an elf, a vampire, etc., often via an \\"academy of magic\\".

Tourism has been further impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19 starting in March 2020. The international economic sanctions imposed on Syria and the sharp drop in the value of the Syrian pound (SYP) also adversely impact tourism in Syria. Before the start of the Syrian Civil War, 8.5 million tourists visited Syria in 2010, who brought in tourist revenue estimated at 30.8 billion SYP (US$8.4 billion, at 2010 rates), and accounted for 14% of the country's economy. By 2015, the number of tourists had declined by more than 98%. Many tourist attractions have been damaged or destroyed by shelling, flights by all major airlines have been suspended, and many major tourist hotels have closed. It is estimated that considerable investment will be necessary to revive Syria‚Äôs tourism industry. Overview=Before the 2011 crisis Non-Arab visitors to Syria reached 1.1 million in 2002, which includes all visitors to the country, not just tourists.The World Factbook. Cia.gov. The total number of Arab visitors in 2002 was 3.2 million, most from Lebanon, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq. Many Iraqi businesspeople set up ventures in Syrian ports to run import operations for Iraq, causing an increased number of Iraqis visiting Syria in 2003‚Äì4. Tourism is a potentially large foreign exchange earner and a source of economic growth. Tourism generated more than 6% of Syria's gross domestic product in 2000, and more reforms were discussed to increase tourism revenues. As a result of projects derived from Investment Law No. 10 of 1991, hotel bed numbers had increased 51% by 1999 and increased further in 2001.Syria country profile, pp. 11-12. A plan was announced in 2002 to develop ecological tourism with visits to desert and nature preserves.Syria country profile, p. 12. Two luxury hotels opened in Damascus at the end of 2004. Tourism had been increasing considerably before the Civil War, that began in March 2011. According to the Syrian Ministry of Tourism in January 2011, about 6 million foreign tourists visited Syria in 2009, increasing to 8.5 million in 2010, a 40% increase. Tourism revenue was 30.8 billion Syrian pound (SYP) (US$8.4 billion) in 2010, 14% of the country's economy. Tourism industry revenue in 2010 was US$6.5 billion, accounting for 12% of the gross domestic product and 11% of employment. After 2011 Since the start of the Syrian Civil War, in March 2011, tourism has declined steeply. According to official reports, hotel rooms designed for foreign tourists have been occupied by refugees. In the first quarter of 2012, tourism revenue was about 12.8 billion Syrian pounds ($178 million), compared with 52 billion Syrian pounds ($1 billion) in the first quarter of 2011, and the number of foreign tourists decreased by more than 76% in the 2012 quarter. Employment in the tourism industry was down by \\"nearly two-thirds\\" in that period. According to UNESCO, five of Syria's six World Heritage Sites have been affected by the civil war. In 2012, Syria sent a letter to the United Nations describing the decline of its tourism industry, noting that the country's hotel-occupancy rate had fallen from 90% the previous year to 15%. As of 2013, overall Syrian tourism revenue had declined by 94%, with Aleppo the worst affected, and the Tourism Minister stated, at the end of September 2013, that 289 tourist destinations had been damaged since 2011. By 2015, the number of tourists had declined by more than 98%. The Ministry of Tourism claimed that 45,000 tourists visited the country in the first half of 2015, but these figures were disputed by observers, according to the Syrian Economic Forum, which stated that Iranian religious tourism was all that remained. According to a 2015 article in The Telegraph, hotels by beaches in the Mediterranean coast in Tartus and Latakia still received internal tourists and one hotel was \\"full\\" in the summer of 2014 and 2015. Interior to the Citadel of Aleppo Reconstruction As the Syrian Arab Army recaptured territory in the southern and western parts of the country, these areas came back under central Syrian government control. Major tourist sites damaged and made inaccessible due to the conflict began to be reconstructed and restored. Teams at damaged UNESCO World Heritage sites such as the Old City of Aleppo, the ruins of Palmyra and Krak des Chevaliers have begun restoration and reconstruction following years of conflict and devastation. Promotion Promotion of tourism in Syria is handled by the Syrian Ministry of Tourism, which also maintains an active Facebook page as well as the official Syria tourism website. In September 2016, Syria's Ministry of Tourism drew criticism from some quarters for releasing a video, \\"Syria Always Beatiful [sic],\\" encouraging tourists to visit its beaches. The video spotlighted regions such as Tartus, which remain somewhat peaceful, though Tartus saw an attack resulting in the deaths of over 150 in May 2016. Attractions Facade of the Great Mosque of Damascus UNESCO sites There are the six UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the country. Twelve other sites submitted to UNESCO are on the organisation's tentative list: Norias of Hama, Ugrarit (Tell Shamra), Ebla (Tell Mardikh), Apam√©e (Afamia), Qasr al- Hayr al-Sharqi, Maaloula, Tartus, Arwad and two sites in the Euphrates valley: Mari (Tell Hariri) and Dura-Europos. The Mushabbak Basilica in Aleppo *Ancient City of Aleppo: The Ancient City of Aleppo is the historic city centre of Aleppo, Syria. The Old City of Aleppo, which is composed of the ancient city within the walls and the old cell-like quarters outside the walls approximately holds an area of , housing about 120,000 residents. Famous for its large mansions, narrow alleys, covered souqs and ancient caravanserais, the Ancient City of Aleppo became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1986. The Krak des Chevaliers *Bosra: The Ancient city of Bosra is an ancient Roman city. Famed for its Roman theatre, possibly the best preserved in the world, the city also holds many remains of the ancient city such as baths, colonnades and remains of ancient houses and temples. *Ancient City of Damascus: The Ancient City of Damascus is the historic city centre of Damascus, Syria. Damascus is the capital and one of the largest cities in Syria. It is commonly known in Syria as ash-Sham () and nicknamed as the City of Jasmine (). In addition to being one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, Damascus is a major cultural and religious centre of the Levant. It's famed for its ancient souks, old city, old Damascene houses and its Umayyad era Mosque, the city also has many remains from the Roman period, such as the Temple of Jupiter, and houses many of the oldest churches in the world, most notably the Chapel of Saint Paul. *The Dead Cities of northern Syria: The dead cities are a group of 700 abandoned villages in northwest Syria between Aleppo and Idlib. Most villages which date from the 1st to 7th centuries, became abandoned between the 8th and 10th centuries. The settlements feature the well-preserved architectural remains of temples, cisterns, bathhouses and many ancient churches from early Christianity.Important dead cities include the Church of Saint Simeon Stylites, Serjilla and al Bara. *Krak des Chevaliers and Qal‚Äôat Salah El-Din: The Krak de Chevaliers is a Crusader era fortress dating back to the 10th century, and is one of the most important preserved medieval castles in the world. The site was first inhabited in the 11th century by a settlement of Kurdish troops garrisoned there by the Mirdasids; as a result it was known as Hisn al-Akrad, meaning the \\"Castle of the Kurds\\". In 1142 it was given by Raymond II, Count of Tripoli, to the Knights Hospitaller. It remained in their possession until it fell in 1271. Together with Qal'at Salah El-Din (Citadel of Saladin), the Krak des Chevaliers is one of the best examples for Crusader era architecture. *Palmyra: The ancient 2000 BC later Roman colonia of Palmyra is an oasis city in the Syrian desert. The ancient Palmyrenes were renowned merchants who got enormous wealth not only by trading by rare commodities from the east, but also by taking advantage of the city's position as an Oasis, bringing enormous wealth to their city. The Palmyrenes used this wealth to build great monuments, such as the Temple of Bel and the Arch of Triumph, and also to design Greco-Roman and Persian influenced Bas-reliefs of their deceased, many of which are nowadays housed in many of the biggest international museums, which show the craftsmanship of the Palmyrenes and their dedication to their religious rituals. During the Syrian Civil War in 2015, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) destroyed large parts of the ancient city, which was recaptured by the Syrian Army on 2 March 2017. War tourism The Syrian conflict is reportedly attracting adventure-seekers. According to retired Israel Defense Forces colonel Kobi Marom, who leads tours of the war zone across the Israeli border, tourists are interested in seeing the conflict and go \\"crazy\\" when they learn that they are probably being observed by Al-Qaeda militants.

Traditionally, Yemen has been a tourism centre for centuries as it is at the middle of the trade routes of the Middle East and the Horn of Africa. Tourism played a fundamental role of the region in global trade and has remained so until the 20th century. Afterwards, there has been a sharp decline in tourism since the 2011 Yemen Crisis. The rise of extremism caused fear in prospective foreign tourists to Yemen. Yemen has four World Heritage Sites, some of the sites have been attacked including historic old city of Sana'a. In 2015 UNESCO declared its plan to protect the world heritage sites of Yemen. Visa policy Citizens of Jordan, Egypt, Syria, Hong Kong and member states of Gulf Co-operation Council do not require visas when entering Yemen. Tourist and business visas do not need an exit visa prior to departure. Those who are staying in Yemen for more than two weeks are required to register at their nearest police station. Failure to register can result in a fine of YR 5,000 at the time of departure. Travel advice Various nations have published travel advice for their citizens who visit Yemen. This advice usually includes matters relating to safety and security, terrorism, local laws and customs and entry requirements. Advice given by the United Kingdom says to respect local Islamic customs. They advise visitors to dress modestly and to refrain from drinking alcohol in public; especially during the Islamic month of Ramadan. The UK also warns about possible terror attacks in tourist places or the kidnap of foreigners by militant groups. Majority of the world's countries have advised their citizens regarding the current situation in Yemen and have discouraged travelling to the country until the issues concerning terrorism are solved or managed properly. However, some nations, such as the Philippines, Taiwan, and Japan, have also noted that once terrorism has been managed properly, tourism partnerships can be offered to Yemen immediately. Attractions There are four World Heritage Sites in Yemen - three are cultural while one is natural. The cultural sites are the Historic Town of Zabid, Old City of Sana'a and Old Walled City of Shibam while the natural site is Socotra Archipelago. In addition, Yemen has identified 10 sites that meet the standards of World Heritage Centre, namely Archaeological site of Marib, Historic city of Saada, Historic City of Thula, Madrasa Amiriya of Rada, Jibla and its surroundings, Jabal Haraz, Jabal Bura, Balhaf/Burum coastal area, the Hawf Area, and Sharma/Jethmun coastal area.https://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/ye In July 2015 a two-day meeting was held in UNESCO headquarters in Paris which established an \\"Emergency Action Plan\\" in response to the widespread destruction of cultural sites in Yemen. The emergency action plan will coordinate the international response of \\"Unite4Heritage\\". Yemen's ambassador to UNESCO Ahmed Sayyad urged the world community to co-operate tor protection the heritage sites in Yemen.

He committed suicide during the Cultural Revolution. He was born in Xiangtan, Hunan Province. He attended Hunan University, then won a scholarship to continue his studies at Beijing Normal University. He was an agent for the Communists during the Second United Front between the Kuomintang and Communist Party. After the foundation of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Zhou served as the Communist Party Secretary of his home province between 1953 and 1957. At the Lushan Conference in 1959, Zhou Xiaozhou and his successor, Zhou Hui, along with Huang Kecheng and Zhang Wentian, lent their support to Peng Dehuai in questioning the wisdom of the Great Leap Forward. He was thus branded a traitor, stripped of his positions, and sent to re-education through labour. In 1962, Zhou was restored to an academic position in Guangzhou, seemingly regaining his political footing. However, at the outset of the Cultural Revolution, Zhou became an easy target for abuse due to his role in criticizing the Great Leap Forward, and committed suicide by drug overdose at the age of 54. He was posthumously rehabilitated in February 1979, under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping. 1912 births 1966 deaths People's Republic of China politicians from Hunan Communist Party of China politicians from Hunan Political office-holders in Hunan Hunan University alumni Suicides during the Cultural Revolution Politicians from Xiangtan Beijing Normal University alumni Chinese politicians who committed suicide ","title":"Zhou Xiaozhou"},{"id":"48523638","text":"Halina Zalewska (1940 - 19 August 1976) was a Swiss-born Italian actress.

He served under the command of the Duke of York in the Flanders Campaign in 1794 then embarked for the West Indies late in 1795, under the command of Sir Ralph Abercromby, and assisted at the capture of the island of St. Lucia in 1796.

Its Khmer name translates literally to \\"Great Temple of Grandfather Chicken\\". It lies not far from two related temples in a densely forested area where access is difficult on one of the passes through the Dangrek Mountains. Prasat Ta Muen Toch (\\"Minor Temple of Grandfather Chicken\\"), the hospital chapel, lies two and half kilometers to the northwest and just 300 meters beyond that is the rest house chapel, Prasat Ta Muen (\\"Temple of Grandfather Chicken\\"). During the 1980s-90s, when the Khmer Rouge controlled the area, the temples in the region were looted by the Khmer Rouge to finance their guerrilla campaign. Many architectural pieces and original sculptures were stolen, sometimes detached using dynamite, and smuggled out of Cambodia or sold on the black market. These three temples, all within a few hundred meters of each other, formed a complex which was an important stop on a major route of the Khmer Empire, the Ancient Khmer Highway from its capital at Angkor to its major administrative center in the northwest, Phimai (now in Thailand). Layout The temple is located in the Ta Muen Thom pass at the top of the escarpment of the Dangrek Mountains which forms the current border between Cambodia and Thailand in the region. North of the border is the Khorat Plateau while to the south are steep cliffs as the mountains form sheer drops down to the plains Northwest Cambodia. Ta Muen Thom is constructed of laterite and laid out in a rectangular plan with the entrance facing south, highly unusual for Khmer temples which usually face east. It is suspected that this is due to the topography, both to meet travelers having just climbed the pass from the plains below and to provide a defensible position with a strategic view southward down the mountains. The temple's enclosure is 46 meters by 38 meters with its center in a central sanctuary constructed of pinkish-grey sandstone and preceded by a mandapa and an antarala. A natural channel in the bedrock was used as the somasutra, a funnel which transported holy water used in rituals from the statue in the main chamber, which flows out from the garbhagriha and indicates the relative importance of the site. On the north side are two towers and two other laterite buildings that are still standing as well as the foundations of three other buildings which are no longer standing. These buildings are the remains of the highway rest house and hospital Jayavarman VII erected to add to the temple complex where pilgrims and travelers would spend the night and recuperate for the next leg of their journey. On the south facade, the same side as the main entrance, is the main gopura, which is much larger than the others. A large broad steep laterite staircase, also facing south and extending well down into Cambodian territory, leads to the entrance of the temple. There is also a laterite staircase that leads down to a stream on the Cambodian side which curves around the temple. The orientation of Ta Muen Thom is very similar to that of Prasat Hin Phimai and others at Phimai Historical Park. Recent excavations inside the main tower have revealed the existence of a natural linga protruding from the top of the hill around which the temple was built. There is a similar natural linga at the Khmer temple Vat Phou in Laos. Access Because of its location on the Thai side of the current border, the temple is only accessible from Thailand. Access from Cambodia would be difficult because the ancient Khmer Highway that led to the pass has long since been retaken by the jungle. During the Cambodian‚ÄìThai border dispute (2009-2011) which was primarily centered around ownership of Preah Vihear Temple, border clashes spread to Ta Muen and access to the temple was temporarily closed. Afterwards, tensions remain high and tourists at the temple are not allowed to venture more than a few meters southward from the main entrance and armed Thai border police stand guard to mark the border. Since 2010, the entrance of Ta Muen Thom temple on Cambodia side has become easier due to the road infrastructure has been developed, including a road leads to Ta Muen Thom temple which was built in 2009 and officially launched in 2010. It consists of 24 km red gravel roads (but it has been upgraded to the asphalt road in recent years) and 500-meter mountainous concrete road. Visitors are recommended to park their cars near the hill then they can continue walking through a half-kilometer mountainous concrete road that some parts of it are steep. At this point, tourists also enjoy with the spectacular landscape of Dangrek mountain range along with many big trees and forest flowers.http://www.camnews.org/2012/08/13/·ûî·üí·ûö·û∂·ûü·û∂·ûë·ûè·û∂·ûò·û∂·ûì·üã·ûí·üÜ-·ûì·û∑·ûÑ-·ûè·û∂·ûÄ·üí·ûö·ûî·û∏ Gallery See also  * Prasat Ta Krabey NotesReferences *Michael Freeman, A guide to Khmer temples in Thailand & Laos, Rivers Books, 1996 974-8900-76-2 *Michael Freeman, Palaces of the Gods: Khmer Art & Architecture in Thailand, River Books, 2001 974-8303-19-5 *Yoshiaki Ishizawa, Along The Royal Roads To Angkor, Weatherhill, 1999 083-4804-72-7 *Claude Jacques and Philippe Lafond, The Khmer Empire, River Books, 2007 974-9863-30-5 *Vittorio Roveda, Images of the gods: khmer mythology in Cambodia, Thailand and Laos, River Books, 2005 974-9863-03-8 *Betty Gosling, Origins of thai art, River Books, 2004 0-8348-0541-3 Archaeological sites in Thailand Isan Angkorian sites in Thailand Tourist attractions in Surin Province Buildings and structures in Surin Province ","title":"Prasat Ta Muen Thom"},{"id":"48523707","text":"19th ADG Awards January 31, 2015  Period Film: The Grand Budapest Hotel  Fantasy Film: Guardians of the Galaxy  Contemporary Film: Birdman The 19th Art Directors Guild Awards, which were given on January 31, 2015, honored the best production designers of 2014.

It is known by many other names including 'Dumelow's Crab', 'Wellington', 'Doncklaer', 'Beauty', and 'Belle de Vennes'. The fruit is not ready for harvest until October, being one of the last of the season, and keeps well into the next year. Though inferior for use as a dessert apple it cooks well and in early-20th century England was one of the most valuable varieties of cooking apple.  History  The variety was first raised by Richard Dumeller (or Dumelow) of Hop John's Hill near Shackerstone in Leicestershire. The original tree had been growing there since at least 1800. It was first exhibited under the name Dumelow's Crab in 1818 and had become known as the Wellington by 1820 when it was exhibited at the Royal Horticultural Society. The alternative name is believed to have arisen from its cultivation at Wellington, Shropshire though it was later incorrectly attributed to the Duke of Wellington under which name it has also been known. The apple is derived from the Northern Greening crossed with an unknown variety. Dumelow's Seedling is parent to the Hounslow Wonder, Cottenham Seedling, Baron Ward, Newton Wonder, Belvoir Seedling, Monarch and Lane's Prince Albert. Dumelow's Seedling is known by more than 50 alternative names that include 'Dumelow's Crab', 'Wellington', 'Doncklaer', 'Beauty', and 'Belle de Vennes'.  Description  The fruit is described as a medium \\"flat-round\\" and is typically around in height and in width. The apples are whiteish-yellow with red mottling and the skin is tough. The fruit is very firm with a crisp, juicy flesh that is slightly yellow. It is said to cook well but for dessert use is inferior to red apples such as Baldwin or Sutton. It was regarded in early 20th-century England as one of the most valuable varieties of cooking apple. Dumelow's Seedling flowers in mid-May and is ready for harvest in early October. The tree is quite productive in alternate years. It is one of the last apples of the season and is said to keep well; retaining its flavour in storage until April and sometimes until the first rhubarb and gooseberry harvest is ready. The young wood of the tree is speckled and it is said to be resistant to canker. The tree is said to be a strong grower, with an upright, round spread of somewhat drooping branches. The bark is a light-brownish red with olive green and the leaves are relatively large and broad.

The eleventh and final named storm and hurricane of the 2015 Atlantic hurricane season, Kate formed out of a disorganized tropical wave that had moved off the coast of Africa on October 30. Unfavorable conditions prevented it from significantly organizing as it traversed the Atlantic. Once it neared the northern coast of Hispaniola on November 7, it began to become somewhat better organized. The next day it developed into a tropical depression; shortly afterwards it developed into Tropical Storm Kate. Kate moved northwest around an area of high pressure, gradually strengthening. On November 11, it intensified into a hurricane while simultaneously peaking in intensity. Shortly afterwards, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Kate caused minor impacts in the Bahamas, other than gusty winds and some rain showers as it passed just to the east on November 9. It also caused minor surf along the East Coast of the United States. Meteorological history On October 30, a poorly-defined tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa with little thunderstorm activity. At this point in the season, tropical waves are uncommon due to increasingly unfavourable conditions, making the origins of Kate \\"rare, but not unprecedented\\" as described by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) in its post-season report on the storm. Traversing through the eastern Atlantic in unfavourable conditions, the disorganised disturbance failed to organise any further. By November 5, however, as the wave approached the Lesser Antilles, a low-level vorticity split from the wave and traveled to the west-northwest, while the tropical wave headed towards Central America. The new disturbance then turned towards Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, at which point the National Hurricane Center began to monitor the disturbance for possible tropical cyclogenesis. On November 7, convection increased as it passed to the northeast of Hispaniola; however, surface pressures were still relatively high. By early on November 8, showers and convection became more concentrated around the area of low pressure, and there was indications that the disturbance was producing gale-force winds in squally bands that were short-lived. It is estimated that Tropical Depression Twelve formed at around 18:00 UTC, after further organization occurred, while located north of the Turks and Caicos Islands. The depression moved to the west in response to an area of high pressure that was situated to its north. Banding features began to develop along with a defined outflow pattern, and after an Air Force reconnaissance aircraft investigated the system on November 9, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Kate at 15:00 UTC that day. The overall size of Kate was initially relatively small, with a compact central dense overcast (CDO) extending only from the center of the storm. Kate continued to move to the west-northwest while steadily strengthening, and later made its closest approach to The Bahamas on November 9 ‚Äì passing about from Cat Island. However, observations reported that the circulation of Kate was very small and did not register in some of the operating stations. By the early morning hours of November 10, Kate began to turn to the north in response to a trough that was coming off the East Coast of the United States. Shortly thereafter, Kate strengthened to just below hurricane intensity with winds of 70 mph (110 km/h), and was initially predicted to become a hurricane shortly thereafter before passing over cooler sea surface temperatures, however intensification briefly halted. By 00:00 UTC on November 11, Kate had intensified into a hurricane as it began to accelerate northeast into and become embedded into the mid-latitude westerlies, after a microwave pass revealed banding features had become more defined near the center. This made it the latest-forming hurricane in the Atlantic basin since Hurricane Epsilon in 2005. Shortly afterwards, Kate reached its peak intensity with winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) and a pressure of a based on continued improvement of its satellite presentation. Afterwards, colder waters and increasing wind shear caused Kate to weaken, and it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by 00:00 UTC on November 12. The remnants of Kate continued to accelerate over the North Atlantic Ocean for another day before slowing down dramatically and turning eastwards before being absorbed by a larger cyclone on November 13. Preparations and impact=Eastern Caribbean The precursor to Kate dropped heavy rainfall on Martinique from November 5 through 7. Up to of rainfall fell there, causing dangerous flash flooding on the island. No fatalities were reported. The Bahamas Tropical Storm Kate over the Bahamas on November 9 Still recovering from the destruction of Hurricane Joaquin nearly a month prior, residents were advised on November 8, before Kate had formed, to take more precautions in the event that warnings were issued. New shelters were opened for the expected areas to be impacted by the then-precursor to Kate. Ahead of the storm, on November 9, a tropical storm warning was issued for the northern portions of the Bahamas as Kate was expected to pass fairly close to the island chain. However, effects were not as bad as expected, due to the storm's circulation being very small. Because of this, some islands did not even report tropical storm-force winds as Kate passed to the east. The warnings were later discontinued as the storm moved away from the area. On November 9, the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) announced that they would closely monitor the progress of the tropical storm, after a Level II Activation code was put into effect. NEMA Captain Stephen Russell advised residents that local administrators had been informed of the impending storm, to enforce that local disaster committees were prepared, and to have shelters opened, in case an evacuation needed to be ordered for low-lying areas, partially those near the outskirts of the island. In northern Eleuthera, the Glass Window Bridge was shut down in advance of tropical storm conditions. One of the airline services in the Bahamas, Bahamasair, later stated that a flight from Nassau to San Salvador would be delayed by day to early on November 10 due to the weather conditions. Further changes regarding flights to other areas in the Bahamas were stated as being issued in the case that conditions worsened. That same day, public schools in Cat Island and San Salvador were closed due to the passing of Kate just to the north, advising students and staff to remain safe. In addition, schools in Eleuthera also closed at noon in advance. Bermuda Only high surf and some outer bands from Kate impacted Bermuda as it accelerated to the north, which was still recovering from Hurricane Joaquin that had passed just west of the island in early October. No damage or deaths were reported. Europe By November 16, the remnants of Kate had already begun to affect the United Kingdom, where some damage was reported. In Wales, high winds from the system knocked down numerous trees, and heavy rain caused flash flooding, which covered roadways. In Ireland, reports indicated that up to of rain fell as the cyclone pushed through, which triggered flash floods and shortly after, evacuations. The area of Donegal reported that a bridge had vanished due to the rising tides. Some people even woke to find their cars destroyed in the flood. Multiple road closures had to be put in place due to the heavy rainfall and floods. Rivers were also reported to have burst their banks, with one river, the River Deel, overflowed and flooded into the city of Crossmolina around 6:30 a.m local time on November 15.

Dorsey was an enthusiastic and pugnacious advocate for the further development of the district. Dorsey also expanded his own pastoral holdings, purchasing land around Moreton Bay and further afield. He returned to Glasgow to study for his Doctorate of Medicine, which he received in 1857. On his return, he was forced to sell land but was nonetheless insolvent from 1862. In 1865 he became government medical officer for the local immigration depot and departments of railway and police. Persistent attempts to increase his salary and working conditions failed, and he soon focused instead on his private practice. He died of heart disease in 1878.

John Templeton Foundation Sir John Templeton (1912-2008) was strongly committed to supporting research in science, theology, philosophy and the social sciences. One of the main goals of his endeavors was to contribute to understanding the fundamental underlying principles of the universe and to building a better society on the ethical, intellectual and spiritual levels. He founded the John Templeton Foundation in 1987, which also includes the Templeton World Charity Foundation. The TWCF chooses which initiatives it funds and does not accept unsolicited proposals. In accordance with the testamentary provisions of Sir John Templeton , it supports worthy programs which seek answers to the \\"big questions\\" and challenges of life and the universe. As well, it provides assistance to persons with exceptional cognitive talent who contribute to the flourishing of humanity. Hungarian Templeton Program This program is implemented with the funding and the support of the Templeton World Charity Foundation and of the European Social Fund as co-sponsor. The program's advisory partner is the Association of Hungarian Talent Support Organizations (Magyar Tehets√©gseg√≠t≈ë Szervezetek Sz√∂vets√©ge - MATEHETSZ). Launched on September 15, 2015 and lasting until February 28, 2017, the Hungarian Templeton Program is a unique pilot program whose main objective is to develop and support exceptional Hungarian cognitive talents in the 10-29 age group. Using a new methodology specifically designed for this purpose, program staff will identify 300 Hungarian youth with exceptional cognitive talents (Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellows) as well as 150 disadvantaged children aged 5‚Äì8 with exceptional cognitive talents. The aim of the program is to bring together a creative community and network of exceptionally talented people whose members will, with the assistance of top- performing contemporary personalities, prepare themselves to take on the momentous task of becoming the leaders, thinkers and entrepreneurs of Hungary and Europe in the decades ahead. A customized one-year talent support program will be developed for each of the selected talented youth (the Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellows). The program also devotes special attention to underprivileged children aged 5‚Äì8. It uses a unique talent testing procedure created for this age group, as well as a talent development program consisting of workshop sessions over a period of several days. The program also offers assistance to talented youth identified during the selection process but not chosen as Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellows by offering them access to the ESF \\"Talents for Hungary\\" enrichment programs also supported by the Association of Hungarian Talent Support Organizations (MATEHETSZ). Selection process The 300 Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellows are to be selected using objective scientific criteria and a new methodology. Selection will involve tests measuring aptitudes in a number of areas. For talented youth aged 10-19 IQ test, vocabulary, problem solving, working memory, motivation and creativity. For talented youth aged 20-29 IQ test, evaluation of achievements and productivity based on a motivation letter, activities thus far, level of interest and an introductory presentation or video. Program framework Cognitive talents selected for the program ‚Äì the Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellows ‚Äì will each benefit from a one-year customized talent support package. Each young person will receive one-on-one mentoring from prominent Hungarian scientists and entrepreneurs who make up the program's roster of mentors. Elements of the support program include e-learning; coaching; personality development; networking; development of communication, linguistic, computer, research, innovation, financial and entrepreneurial skills; assistance in choosing a career path in a context of social responsibility. In addition to supporting skill development in specific areas, the program places especial emphasis on encouraging Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellows to use their aptitudes and knowledge responsibly for the good of society. Program content Based on their individual needs and the options available in the program, Junior Fellows will receive a personalized talent support package which may include: * Participation in scientific research and development projects * Familiarization with research centers, cases and practices in both scientific and business contexts * Scholarships * International travel (competitions, camps, conferences) * Business trainings (e.g. Lean, Start-up) * LinkedIn, Everyday Heroes and PREZI trainings * Public speaking and presentation-making trainings * Language learning opportunities * Familiarization with case studies in a business context * Soft skill trainings * Activities to develop social responsibility * Drafting business plans, support for start-ups * Support for social entrepreneurs (Ashoka) * Participation in national and international talent day events * Innovation camp Post-program opportunities This pilot program is for one year, and is expected to continue in Hungary and serve as a model for expansion into other countries in versions adapted to regional cultural differences. Talented youth selected for the program will be monitored and assisted for a few years after the end of the program by the ongoing network of contacts in the Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellow Network. Mentoring Substantive support for the Program is provided by our network of mentors: scientists, researchers, experts and businesspeople who have shown exceptional levels of achievement in their fields and careers. Mentoring is a crucial element of the program and a mentor will be assigned to every Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellow.

It belongs administratively to the municipality of San Andres, Quezon province, and is coterminous with the barangay of the same name. With a population of 1,643 inhabitants in 2015, it is the smallest of seven barangays in San Andres. The island is known for its pristine mangrove forest and coral reefs. It is also visited for its white sandy beaches and rich bird life. Its mangrove forest which covers approximately of the island's central and northern portions is protected under the National Integrated Protected Areas System as a wilderness area called the Alibijaban Island Wilderness Area. of waters surrounding it have also been declared a marine protected area known as the Alibijaban Fish Sanctuary. Description Alibijaban is located in the southwestern end of Ragay Gulf approximately from the mainland of Bondoc Peninsula. It is roughly from north to south, and from east to west at its widest point. It is a low-lying island surrounded by a fringing reef which is interspersed with seagrass beds near the shore. The island's central and northern interior are dominated by mangrove wilderness, with most of the population concentrated on two sitios on the island's western and southwestern coast facing San Andres and Bondoc Peninsula. Its coastal formations include sandy beaches and rocky shores, particularly in its northeastern side. The island is accessible via motorized banca from the port of San Andres. It is southeast of Manila via the Pan-Philippine Highway and Bondoc Peninsula Road. Conservation Alibijaban's mangrove forest Alibajaban has some of the most undisturbed mangrove wilderness in the Philippines. It hosts at least 22 mangrove species and 14 species of birds, including the Tabon scrubfowl, white-collared kingfisher, jungle crow, black- naped oriole, island collared dove, Asian glossy starling, chestnut munia, Philippine pied fantail, common emerald dove, black-crowned night heron, common snipe. It also supports a number of fruit bats and monitor lizards. Since the establishment on the island of a wilderness protected area in 1981, the Community Environment and Resources Office (CENRO) under the Department of Environment and Natural Resources and Provincial Government of Quezon now administers the area. The island also has the most diverse marine habitat in the region of Ragay Gulf. It is home to at least 30 genera of hard coral dominated by Porites, Montipora and Acropora. Its adjacent waters are visited by whale sharks, manta rays, and pawikans (marine turtles). The passage of a municipal ordinance in 2006 prohibited all kinds of fishing in the area. Tourism Alibijaban is an emerging backpacker destination. It's fine white sand beach and mangrove forest are few of the reasons why backpackers visit the island. The activities to do include: beach bumming, camping, boating, and snorkeling.

Her parents divorced when she was four years old; she said that event caused her to take great interest in her schoolwork, which she enjoyed. She initially intended to be a physicist, but convinced herself that she was not doing as well as the male students and subsequently switched to biology. She later discovered that she had indeed been doing as well as the boys in the physics exams, and pondered what she would have done differently if she'd had a female role model or encouragement to stay in physics at the time. In 2017, she was named one of the honorary STEM ambassadors at the STEM Inspiration Awards, for championing science education and being a role model for youth interested in related careers.

History Chester was built by Edward Withy and Company in their Middleton Yard at Hartlepool and launched on 29 April 1884, sponsored by Miss Florence Withy. She was designed for the passenger and cargo service between Grimsby, England, and Hamburg, Germany. She had a long poop deck, a long bridge house, and a long topgallant forecastle. The bridge house was fitted up for the accommodation of thirty first-class passengers (including ladies‚Äô cabin), the captain, and so on. There was accommodation in the forecastle for second-class passengers, and in the poop aft for officers and crew. In the ‚Äòtween decks were fittings for 100 emigrants. On 4 December 1885, Chester was involved in a collision with her sister ship , which resulted in the sinking of Wakefield and the drowning of her stewardess. In 1897, Chester passed to the Great Central Railway. On 28 September 1910 she was in a collision in the River Elbe with a Swedish steamer which resulted in her being badly damaged. She was beached to prevent sinking. However, she sank quickly into the soft moving sand and became a total wreck, the water having flooded her holds.

On the evening of June 18, 1947, the Lockheed L-049 Constellation serving the flight, known as the Clipper Eclipse (previously Clipper Dublin), suffered an engine failure. This led to the overheating of the remaining engines until one caught fire, which spread to the aircraft. The heat from burning magnesium parts caused the engine to fall from the aircraft, leaving it unable to maintain altitude. Early in the morning of June 19, 1947 the plane crashed in the Syrian desert 4 miles (6.4 km) from the town of Mayadin. Fifteen people were killed, including 7 crew and 8 passengers. The three surviving crew members were third officer Gene Roddenberry (who went on to create the original Star Trek television series), the chief purser, and one stewardess. After rescuing passengers from the burning wreckage, Roddenberry took control as the ranking flight officer and organized scout parties to find aid. By midday, the Syrian Army took the survivors to the hospital at Deir ez- Zor. The majority returned to the United States quickly while Roddenberry remained in Syria for two weeks to answer questions about the crash from the local government.  Flight history  Prior to the fatal flight, the Lockheed L-049 Constellation known as the Clipper Eclipse had suffered engine problems during a flight earlier that week. This had required it to turn back near Gander, Newfoundland on the outbound leg of the journey, and delayed it for two days. A cylinder was replaced in the number 2 engine, as a failure in the top piston ring was found. A further problem was found in that engine later in the week while in Rome. Captain Joseph Hart, Jr., 42, and chief purser Anthony Volpe were walking under the wing when Volpe spotted what he thought was oil dripping from the engine. It turned out to be hydraulic fluid and required a replacement pump to be installed. Captain Hart's flight crew included first officer Robert McCoy, 25, from Maugansville, Maryland, and third officer Gene Roddenberry, 25, of River Edge, New Jersey. Roddenberry had no role on the plane to perform, as he was \\"deadheading\\" ‚Äì riding as a passenger on the flight without any set duties ‚Äì although that changed during the flight. There were a total of 36 passengers and crew on the plane. The plane departed Karachi at 3:37pm on a flight to Istanbul. This was the first leg of the return leg of the journey back to New York. The flight was expected to take ten and a half hours, and fly at a cruising altitude of . Five hours into the flight, Roddenberry took over from Hart at the wheel to give the Captain a break. While Hart was out of the cockpit, the number one engine developed a fault with the exhaust rocker arm, and so Roddenberry shut the engine down. Hart returned to the cockpit and evaluated the situation. Knowing that the plane could fly on three engines, and that the local airstrips would not be able to make immediate repairs, he decided to continue on to Istanbul. The remaining engines, however, could not take the increased load and began to overheat. Hart descended the plane in an attempt to cool them, also reducing the power in order to keep them going. At 10 pm, he ordered radioman Nelson Miles to advise local fields of their position, which was recorded as being at , and east of Baghdad, Iraq. The Royal Air Force field at Habbaniya suggested that the Eclipse should land there, but Hart was worried once again about repair facilities and decided to press on. A cockpit alarm activated at around 11:30 pm, indicating that the number 2 engine had caught fire. Fire suppressant measures failed to put out the fire, and the engine quickly became so hot that the magnesium components began to burn. Hart sent Roddenberry back to the passenger compartment to ready them for a crash landing, knowing that the engine would quickly fall from the plane causing the plane to become un- airworthy. Hart wanted to take the plane to the airstrip at Deir ez-Zor, Syria, but it became apparent that he did not have sufficient time to make it there. So he began to take the plane down, and ordered Miles to radio a distress message. Roddenberry reassured the passengers that everything was under control. He ordered the stewardess to stay in her seat while he and Volpe reiterated the crash procedures to the passengers. The chief purser sat next to the stewardess near the front of the plane, while Roddenberry sat three rows from the rear. The fire spread to the wing and shortly afterwards, the engine separated from the plane. This ruptured the gasoline lines, feeding the fire. As the plane was coming down, a passenger screamed loudly and Roddenberry moved to comfort her; seconds later the plane struck the ground. Roddenberry suffered two broken ribs, not having been strapped down. The aircraft crashed near Mayadin and the Euphrates river at around 3:30 am local time.http://www.planecrashinfo.com/1947/1947-42.htm Date: June 19, 1947 Time: 23:40 The pilot's attempt to bring the plane down safely in the desert was later praised by one of the surviving passengers. A passenger said that the landing would have been successful had an engine on the port wing not dug into the ground, dragging the plane in that direction in a ground loop and breaking it in two. There were 15 people killed in the crash, 8 passengers and 7 crew members. The impact killed the crew in the cockpit, and ripped the sides of the fuselage away from the plane. This enabled some of the passengers to jump directly from the burning plane to the ground. Roddenberry plus the surviving crew members began evacuating the injured from the burning plane. Injured passengers were handed over to the uninjured passengers who took them further away. A passenger's seatbelt would not release until Roddenberry forced it open and helped her to safety. He continued to help passengers, and attempted to put out fires with a pillow as they spread through the passenger cabin. Soon the fire had spread so much that further trips couldn't be made into the aircraft for survivors. \\"The last passenger Roddenberry pulled out died in his arms.\\"https://www.snopes.com/roddenberry-plane-crash/ \\"The last passenger he pulled out died in his arms.\\"  Search and recovery  Gene Roddenberry (photographed in 1961) was the ranking flight officer following the crash. Equipment was gathered from the burning wreckage, including several first aid kits, a number of the passengers' coats and an inflatable life raft. As the only surviving flight officer, Roddenberry took command of the situation, but did so without knowing if the plane's position had been radioed to authorities. First aid was conducted, and after sunrise, the raft was inflated and propped up to provide shade and shelter. Shortly afterwards, a number of desert tribesmen approached the survivors. Roddenberry approached them, and later stated he had influenced them to the extent that they only robbed the dead and spared the survivors. Spotting telegraph poles and wires in the distance, Roddenberry sent two teams of two men each to follow the wires in both directions and report back once they saw something. After they departed, local townsmen arrived at the crash site. They too stole from the wreckage, and also from the survivors, and after a short while, only their clothing remained. A team reported back that they had found the town of Mayadin, and Roddenberry made the desert trek into the town, where he found a telephone and reported in to the airstrip at Deir ez-Zor at around 8am. Syrian Army planes and ground troops were dispatched to recover the survivors. The first public reports of the crash came from a message sent to Pan Am's office in Damascus, who the surviving crew members were. Initial reports had confused the Clipper Eclipse with the Clipper America, which at the time was conducting Pan Am's inaugural around-the-world flight. By midday, the survivors had been transported by the Syrian Army to the Presbyterian mission hospital at Deir ez-Zor. The most seriously injured of them were transported by plane to Beirut. Roddenberry and the uninjured passengers were flown to Damascus. Several survivors of the Eclipse arrived in the United States on June 23, at La Guardia Airport, New York City. Roddenberry was delayed in Syria, as the government wanted him to aid their investigation into the crash. Following two weeks of questioning, he departed for the United States. Later in July, surviving crew were questioned at the Civil Aeronautics Board at the Lexington Hotel in New York City. Robert W. Crisp, who was presiding over the investigation, entered into the record a commendation for all three. The purser and stewardess received further commendations from the Transport Workers Union of America, and one from Roddenberry who wrote of their heroism to the Pan Am flight service department. In February 1948, the official report placed the blame for the crash on Pan Am for failing to replace the number two engine entirely when it developed repeated failures. Roddenberry resigned from Pan-Am following another flight incident; after that, he became a television writer and producer, ultimately creating the Star Trek franchise.

The species is only known from a few areas in the far west of the state and has been declared \\"vulnerable\\" by the Australian Government and \\"threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia.  Description  Drakaea concolor is similar to others in the genus in that it has a single, ground hugging leaf and an underground tuber. In this case, the leaf is heart shaped, about in diameter, dark green and rather glossy. The leaf veins are inconspicuous. The stem is long and the stalk of the single flower is long. Its flower is also similar to those of other hammer orchids in that the labellum resembles a flightless female thynnid wasp however it can be distinguished by lacking a spine on the column. The flowers of Drakaea glyptodon and Drakaea elastica also lack a spine, but can be distinguished from this species by having a light green leaf (D. elastica) or having distinct veins in the leaf (D. glyptdon). The sepal at the back of the flower is long and the two at the sides are . The petals are also long. The insect-like labellum has a head about half as long as the body and its stalk, measured from the hinge is long. Unlike some other hammer orchids, the labellum is all the same dark maroon colour. Flowers appear in August and September.  Taxonomy and naming  Drakaea concolor was first formally described by Stephen Hopper and Andrew Brown in 2007. Their description was published in Australian Systematic Botany. The specific epithet is from the Latin concolor and alludes to the uniform dark colour of the labellum.  Distribution and habitat  The kneeling hammer orchid is only known from four areas near Geraldton, Kalbarri, Coorow and Northampton. Its distribution is the most northerly of the genus. It grows in sand in shrubland or woodland. Ecology The kneeling hammer orchid is similar to other hammer orchids in that it is pollinated by a single species of male thynnid wasp using sexual deception. The orchid's labellum is similar in shape and scent to a flightless female thynnid wasp. The kneeling hammer orchid often grows in the same areas as other hammer orchids which are pollinated by a different species of thynnid wasp.  Conservation  In 2008, the total known population of mature, flowering plants in this species was estimated as 120. The Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife classifies the species as \\"threatened\\" meaning that it is considered likely to become extinct, or rare and in need of special protection. The Australian Government lists its status under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act as \\"vulnerable\\". The main threats to the species' survival are fire during its growing and flowering stages and grazing or trampling by pigs and goats in some habitats.

Simon and Jude (Kostel svat√©ho ≈†imona a Judy), situated next to the Brutalist Hotel InterContinental on U Milosrdn√Ωch Street in the Old Town of Prague, dates back to 1354, when a hospital was founded on the site. The building was adjoined by a chapel that was sanctified by bishop Arno≈°t of Pardubice, a close friend of Emperor Charles IV.Campbell, G., The Grove Encyclopedia of Northern Renaissance Art (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009). History In 1615‚Äì1920 the chapel was significantly enlarged to a hall construction with galleries and chapels, and windows in the Late Gothic style were added. In 1620 the new church, a mixture of Gothic and Renaissance styles, was erected by members of the Protestant sect Bohemian Brethren, was consecrated on July 14 of that year, and, after Battle of White Mountain, was (together with the adjoined St. Francis Hospital, Na Franti≈°ku) entrusted as a Christmas gift by Emperor Ferdinand II to the Brothers Hospitallers of Saint John of God, who to this day own the complex. About a century later Sts. Simon and Jude was remodelled in the High Baroque style, apparent to this day in its interior decorations‚Äîaltars, statues, the pulpit, tromp d‚Äôoeil murals and marquetry, and in the loft was installed a pipe organ by Andreas Wambetsser of north Bohemia, which in combination with the sanctuary's acoustics would attract W. A. Mozart and J. Haydn to perform there.Reisman, M., \\"An organ (re)fit for the new millennium\\" , Prague Post, Feb. 16, 2000. Among artists involved were Ferdinand Maxmili√°n Brokoff, Josef Hager and V. V. Reiner, author of the main altar piece. The widely read author Alois Jir√°sek, whose works would later be coopted by the Communist Party and reissued as required textbooks, wrote about the Church of Sts. Simon and Jude and the hospital to which it is adjoined in his 5-volume historical novel F. L. Vƒõk (1891‚Äì1906). In 1847, per Jir√°sek's account, a medical surgeon named Celestine Opitz performed the world's first operation under anesthesia at St. Francis, consequently enabling the hospital and church to draw support from Tomas Garrigue Masaryk, Edvard Benes and Pope Pius XI. Among Opitz' colleagues at St. Francis was the surgeon/composer Jan Theobald Held, a musical figure made famous by his patriotic characterization in F. L. Vƒõk.Jir√°sek, A., F. L. Vƒõk (Prague: Tiskem a n√°kladem J. Otty, 1891‚Äì1906). Communism C. 1950 the church was deconsecrated. Over the next four decades the structure served as a warehouse. Post-Velvet Revolution In 1989‚Äì1993, with the fall of communism, the city of Prague endeavored to restore Sts. Simon and Jude, including the installation of floor heating to facilitate comfortable use year-round. The church was never reconsecrated, and the maintenance of Sts. Simon and Jude was handed over to Prague Symphony Orchestra in exchange for its use as a concert hall. In 2000 the historic pipe organ was overhauled by organ builders Jaroslav T≈Øma and Vladimir Slajch, and the improved instrument was unveiled at an inaugural concert by Michal Novenko. \\"The sound is clearer, even more lively, thanks to the new old-fashioned bellows,\\" Novenko told Prague Post. \\"The organ master needs to think in the spirit of the original organ builder.

Biography  Ana Margarida Arruda graduated in History in 1978, from the Faculty of Letters of the University of Lisbon. She earned her PhD in Archaeology in 2000 from the same university, where she is working as researcher and professor since 1993. Arruda has collaborated with several universities including the Universidad Complutense of Madrid, the University of Seville or the University Pompeu i Fabra of Barcelona in Spain and the universities of Toulouse and of Paris 1 in France. Arruda has participated and studied in depth most of the archaeological excavations related to the Phoenician colonisation of Portugal, like the former coastal sites of Santa Olaia, Abul, Alca√ßova de Santar√©m, Castle of Castro Marim, Con√≠mbriga, Set√∫bal, among others. Arruda has demonstrated that the Phoenician presence in Portugal, mainly along its coast, started in the I millennium before Christ. She evidenced the greater antiquity of the archaeological sites of Santar√©m and Con√≠mbriga with regard to the ones of Santa Olaia and Abul. She posits that the main interest of the Phoenicians for this region of the Iberian Peninsula was to develop trade, without discarding possible Phoenician interest for its native metallurgical technology. She do not discard the theory of the Spanish scholars Francisco Jos√© Moreno Arrastio and Fernando L√≥pez Pardo that Phoenicians were also interested the slave trade. However she disagreed with the theory that agriculture was the main reason for the Phoenician colonisation of Portugal as proposed by Carlos Gonz√°lez Wagner and Jaime Alvar Ezquerra.
