He is first mentioned in Denmark in 1634 when he is granted a property in Nyk√∏bing Falster, but was probably by then already court pharmacist for Prince Christian, a position he held until the dissolution of the court in 1652. In 1656 he was granted a royal license to open a pharmacy in Nyk√∏bing Falster (L√∏be Apotek). The following year he also opened a pharmacy in Nakskov. In 1660 he obtained a royal license to open Svane Apotek in Copenhagen and ceded his pharmacies in Nyk√∏bing and Nakskov to two son-in- laws. Svaneapotek was then located in the no longer existing street H√∏jbrostr√¶de. He passed Svane Apotek on to a son by the same name in 1873. He died in Nyk√∏bing Falster on 29 June 1679.

Herbarium Danicum sempervivum, a collection of painted illustrations of 140 plants created at Heerfordt's initiative by two foreign artists, is now kept by the Royal Danish Library.

The clade was defined as a node-based clade containing the most recent common ancestor of dolichosaurs, adriosaurs, Aphanizocnemus, and fossil and extant Ophidia and all of its descendants. The existence of Ophidiomorpha as a clade may become problematic as it is placed within the Pythonomorpha, a clade that itself is not universally agreed upon containing mosasaurs and snakes, their most recent common ancestor and all of its descendants. Indeed, most 20th-century herpetologists and paleontologists rejected this idea and sought instead to demonstrate a close relationship between mosasaurs and varanid lizards. Pythonomorpha was later resurrected by a number of paleontologists (Lee, 1997; Caldwell et Lee, 1997) who had conducted cladistic analyses that seemed to show that snakes and mosasaurs may have been more closely related to one another than either were to the varanid lizards, and that snakes more likely arose from aquatic ancestors.Lee, M.

He was born to a poor family, had little formal education and began work in a shawl factory at the age of 16. Later he joined a silk company based in Liepzig, Germany, married into the owners' family and was placed in charge of its Lyon operations. Working first for his in-laws and then independently, he made a fortune in silk. Arl√®s-Dufour also became involved in banking, railways and the Suez canal project. He played an important role in the Lyon Chamber of Commerce, and as a member of the jury in various international expositions. He believed in free trade and in social institutions that would help the most disadvantaged social classes. Early years Fran√ßois Barth√©lemy Arl√®s was born on 3 June 1797 in S√®te, H√©rault. His father joined the army as a private soldier and had risen to the rank of battalion commander by the time of the Napoleonic Wars. Fran√ßois received little schooling as a child, but after his father retired gained some education at the Lyc√©e Imp√©rial √† Paris. His father died in 1811 and two years later his mother, who was illiterate, was forced to withdraw Fran√ßois Arl√®s from school due to lack of money. At the age of 16 he became a factory boy at a shawl factory, then a worker and then a foreman. He said later, \\"I treated my workmen firmly, but with the respect that man owes to man. I placed myself between the servant and the master, not to frustrate the master, but to be useful to both.\\" He added, \\"I was hungry and I remember it. \\" He was an enthusiastic supporter of Napoleon, and in 1815 after the emperor returned from exile in Elba, the 18-year-old Arl√®s volunteered for the army. He arrived too late to fight in the Battle of Waterloo. His employer gave him back his job, and from this time on he became a pacifist. Silk merchant In 1816 Arl√®s made several long sales trips in Germany with a sample of fabrics and shawls. In 1817 he met Prosper Enfantin in Frankfurt, the future leader of Saint-Simonianism. Also that year he visited the silk trading house in Leipzig of Dufour fr√®res, a family that had emigrated from France after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes. Fran√ßois Arl√®s tried to teach himself better French, and also learned German and English and studied the new discipline of political economy. In Munich he met Gustave d‚ÄôEichtal(fr), who would become banker of the Saint-Simonian movement. He read the works of Adam Smith, David Ricardo and John Stuart Mill. He became a firm supporter of the sovereignty of the people, and the 1819 Carlsbad Decrees confirmed him in his hostility to kings and priests. In 1820 he talked with Jean-Baptiste Say at the Conservatoire des arts et m√©tiers in Paris. In 1821 Dufour fr√®res offered him employment with their firm. Street sign in Lyon commemorating Arl√®s-Dufour In 1824 Arl√®s married Pauline Dufour, only daughter of one of the Dufour brothers. At the time of his marriage he joined his name to that of his wife to become \\"Arl√®s-Dufour\\". In 1825 he was placed in charge of the important Dufour freres branch in Lyon. This was the start of his prosperous career as a silk merchant. He visited England in 1826 and every year after. There he succeeded in business and also made valuable friendships. John Bowring, a follower of Jeremy Bentham, introduced utilitarianism to him. He became a friend of George Villiers, the future Lord Clarendon, and met George Richardson Porter, in charge of statistics at the Board of Trade. Porter gave him facts that supported his belief in free trade. Bowring visited Lyon in 1832. Arl√®s-Dufour also established cordial relations with British political and business leaders such as John Bright and Richard Cobden. During the American recession that followed the Panic of 1837 Arl√®s-Dufour was almost ruined by customers in America defaulting on their debts to him. He left Lyon for London en route to New York. In London he received financial support from his friend and correspondent William Leaf and did not have to continue his journey. In partial recovery of his debt he received two properties at Kingston and Wilbur in New York State. He liquidated his company honorably. with the help of his international correspondents and Lyon notables, and in 1839 created his own company, Arl√®s-Dufour. The company opened branches in Z√ºrich, Saint-√âtienne, Paris, Basel, Krefeld, Marseille, London and New York City. The new company had its headquarter in Milan. In 1851 the building holding its offices and warehouse in Milan was destroyed by fire. Arl√®s-Dufour was trapped in the rubble of the building for a while, but managed to escape with his wallet and account books. However, since some of the silks were not insured he suffered a second financial collapse, but was again able to rebuild his company with credit from his friends. In 1855 Arl√®s-Dufour hired Natalis Rondot to manage his Paris branch. Rondot helped him make contact with the Scottish firm Jardine Matheson of Hong Kong, a leader in the Far East silk trade. He agreed not to open any silk exchange in the Far East, but to buy from Jardine, Matheson, who would transport it. Arl√®s-Dufour would then sell through his network in Europe. This verbal contract would be respected for a century. He was concerned by the financial downturn that followed the Panic of 1857, and retired from business in 1859. The company was passed to his two edest sons and his son in law. He retained a fortune of 2.8 million francs. Free trade and Saint-Simonianism Barth√©lemy Prosper Enfantin (1796‚Äì1864), long-time friend and partner of Arl√®s-Dufour As early as 1822 Arl√®s wrote, \\"The greatest and most conclusive step, and that which our state of civilization imperiously requires, is the abolition of customs and obstacles, which make communication and exchange between people difficult or impossible.\\" In 1828 he wrote, \\"Let us abolish these barriers ... multiply our relationships, live as brothers.\\" He believed that freedom of trade must lead to universal peace. In 1828 he published an article in the Lyon paper Le Pr√©curseur in which he spoke in favour of the free export of French silks in return for the free entry of foreign silks, which drew protests from those who felt the Lyon silk industry could not survive without protection. In articles in 1832 and 1833 in L‚Äô√âcho de la Fabrique Arl√®s-Dufour wrote on subjects such as industry in Lyon, tariffs, cooperation with England and a progressive income tax. Arl√®s-Dufour was sympathetic to the workers, having been one himself, and looked for ways to make their life easier. He soon decided that free competition was the answer. He became a convert to Saint-Simonianism in 1829 and remained faithful to these ideals for the rest of his life. The goal was to hasten social change during the transition to an industrial society following the principle that \\"All social institutions must aim at improving the moral, intellectual and physical fortunes of the most numerous and poorest classes\\". Arl√®s-Dufour was a friend of the Pereires and the Talbots, business leaders who were also Saint-Simonians. He wrote, \\"Everywhere, the class that has nothing in common but misery is at war with the one that has everything. And who could be surprised at that? Society, that is to say, the men who have, take care of this class only to contain it.\\" However, he was opposed to the demands of workers in Lyon for minimum payments for their work, saying that a manufacturer could not operate at a loss. When the canuts (Lyon silk workers) revolted in November 1831 many observers blamed the Saint-Simonians for the uprising. Arl√®s-Dufour believed in free competition, productive work, huge manufacturing enterprises and a strong sense of social solidarity. He contributed to the worker's newspaper L'Echo de la Fabrique, where Enfantin says he \\"threw in as much Saint-simonianism as possible\\". In the early days of the French Second Republic in April 1848 he launched an appeal to the workers of La Croix-Rousse saying, \\"It is almost twenty years since ... I called for an age of association of everyone, rich and the poor, manufacturer and the worker, by organization of labour, classification by vocation and the compensation according to work.\\" In his property at Oullins he planted a lime tree, the \\"tree of liberty.\\" However, he refused to run for political office. Other enterprises Nadar Arl√®s-Dufour appears to have been the force behind the creation of the Banque de Lyon in 1835‚Äì36. He was a promoter of the Compagnie du chemin de fer de Paris √† Lyon(fr) (Paris-Lyon Railway) and the Compagnie du chemin de fer de Lyon √† Avignon(fr) (Lyon-Avignon Railway) and was a director of both of these companies. He helped merge them to form the Chemins de fer de Paris √† Lyon et √† la M√©diterran√©e (PLM: Paris-Lyon- Mediterranean Railway), and seems to have been a director of the PLM. In 1833 Enfantin led a party of 20 French technicians to Egypt to undertake new surveys and put new life into the Suez Canal and Nile Barrage projects. He met Ferdinand de Lesseps, at the time Vice-Consul for France in Egypt, and was presented to the Khedive Muhammad Ali, who approved the barrage but not the canal. Enfantin stayed in Egypt until 1837 working on the barrage, then returned to France. In his 1834 Un mot sur les fabriques √©trang√®res Arl√®s- Dufour applauded the Suez Canal project, which would soon bring Paris as close to Calcutta as to Saint Petersburg. In 1844 Enfantin founded the journal L'Alg√©rie, with some funding from Charles Ignace Plichon. Enfantin, with support from Arl√®s-Dufour, was dreaming of creating a great railway network in France. He planned to also establish maritime commercial links with the Indies through a Suez canal. In 1846 Enfantin and Arl√®s-Dufour created the Soci√©t√© d'√âtudes du Canal de Suez, with French, English and German sections. The other French member were Jules, L√©on and Paulin Talabot. The English members were Robert Stephenson and Edward Starbuck. The other members were Alois Negrelli of Vienna and F√©ronce and Sellier of Liepzig, who representedGerman firms. The company had initial capital of 150,000 francs, with its headquarters in Enfantin's house. In effect it was a semi-official enterprise, with strong support from the Muhammed Ali, who paid most of the cost. The plan was set back in 1849 when Muhammed Ali Pasha died and was succeeded by the pro-English Abbas Pasha. The Suez project was revived in 1854 when Sa'id Pasha came to power in Egypt and heard and approved de Lesseps' proposal in November 1854. Lesseps wrote warm and enthusiastic letters to Arl√®s-Dufour when his project began to prosper at the end of 1854 and the start of 1855. He also asked him to make contact with the main banking houses in France and Europe and the \\"great capitalists of England\\". As a founder, Arl√®s-Dufour would be rewarded with a share of the profits. Later Lesseps would take full credit for the canal project. In 1853 Arl√®s-Dufour and Enfantin founded the Compagnie g√©n√©rale des Eaux in Lyon, and in 1854 founded the Lyon Soci√©t√© des Omnibus. In 1856 he participated in the capital of the Deutsche Credit Anstalt founded by his friends in Leipzig. Arl√®s-Dufour participated in foundation of the Cr√©dit Industriel et Commercial in 1859. He was the true founder of the Cr√©dit Lyonnais in 1863, with his employee Henri Germain. The Cr√©dit Lyonnais was launched by Germain on 6 July 1863 with an innovative model based on accepting small deposits on which it paid interest, and using the deposits to finance short-term loans. The first shareholders included Arl√®s-Dufour and other Saint-Simonians such as Paulin Talabot, Enfantin and Michel Chevalier, a close advisor to Napoleon III. There were 140 initial depositors, growing to 10,000 by its second year. The bank made an agreement with the new HSBC bank founded by a nephew of Jardine. When Enfantin died in 1864 he left all his property to Arl√®s-Dufour. Public activities Richard Cobden praised Arl√®s-Dufour for his efforts in achieving free trade between France and Britain. Arl√®s-Dufour was hostile to the monarchy of the Bourbon Restoration, and during the July Revolution of 1830 served in the National Guard and was temporarily deputy mayor. He was a municipal councilor of La Guilloti√®re, a district of Lyon, in 1855, and general councilor of the Rh√¥ne department. Arl√®s-Dufour was elected to the Lyon Chamber of Commerce in 1832, and remained a member for almost 36 years. He exerted a strong liberal influence, and gained a considerable reputation for his frank statements about the policies of successive governments. He supported Bowring in his efforts to reduce tariffs in 1834, but they faced strong opposition from the winegrowers and the Lyon Chamber of Commerce refused to give support. As a member of the Lyon Chamber of Commerce, Arl√®s-Dufour organized an exhibition of foreign silk factories in Lyon in 1834 so local producers could compare their goods to those of their main foreign competitors. Arl√®s-Dufour was a member of the jury at the Exposition des produits de l'industrie fran√ßaise in Paris in 1844 and 1849. He attended The Great Exhibition in 1851 in London as a member of the jury. He was secretary- general of the imperial commission for the 1855 Paris Exposition Universelle. He was again a member of the international jury at the 1862 International Exhibition in London and the 1867 Exposition Universelle in Paris. During the 1851 exposition Arl√®s-Dufour discussed establishment of a free trade agreement with his friend Cobden, and this led to cooperation between Cobden's party and the French Association for Free Trade. However, there remained strong opposition to free trade in France, and it was not until 1860 that the Emperor imposed a treaty of commerce with England by a \\"customs coup\\". Arl√®s-Dufour's struggle for free trade was finally vindicated with the 1860 Cobden‚ÄìChevalier Treaty for free trade between Britain and France. Richard Cobden, who signed the treaty on behalf of Britain, wrote a personal note to him thanking him for the role he had played in the conclusion of the agreement. In August 1860 Napoleon III visited Lyon, where he made Arl√®s a Commander of the Legion of Honour. Rosa Bonheur. Arl√®s-Dufour helped obtain the award of the Legion of Honour for her. Arl√®s-Dufour gave his support to Julie-Victoire Daubi√© in her efforts to become the first woman to obtain a Bachelor's degree in France. He was one of the adjudicators in 1859 for a prize that Daubi√© won for her essay La Femme pauvre au XIX si√®cle (Women and Poverty in the Nineteenth Century). He and Daubi√© founded the Association pour l‚Äô√©mancipation progressive de la femme. He persuaded the Empress Eug√©nie to award the Legion of Honour to the painter Rosa Bonheur. Arl√®s-Dufour was involved in various charitable organizations including the Comit√© auxiliaire de bienfaisance (from 1829), the Caisse de pr√™ts des chefs d'atelier de soierie and the Soci√©t√© de Secours mutuels des ouvriers en soie. He was a strong believer in the right of poor people to education. He founded the Soci√©t√© d‚ÄôInstruction primaire du Rh√¥ne in 1828, and was this society's secretary general until his death. Arl√®s-Dufour and D√©sir√© Girardon, professor at the Martini√®re college, founded the √âcole Centrale lyonnaise pour l'Industrie et le Commerce in 1857. The purpose was to train the best students of the Martini√®re School in chemistry, industrial mechanics, civil construction and industrial design. The school, today the √âcole centrale de Lyon, opened on 3 November 1857 with 14 students. In 1864 Arl√®s-Dufour founded the Soci√©t√© d'enseignement professionnel du Rh√¥ne(fr). He also founded a public library, a free primary school and a free secondary school in the Lyon suburb of Oullins. On 30 November 1867 Arl√®s-Dufour. √âmile de Girardin and Fr√©d√©ric Passy founded the International and Permanent League for Peace. In 1868 he created a homeopathic dispensary in Lyon. Death and legacy Fran√ßois Barth√©lemy Arl√®s-Dufour died on 21 January 1872, in Vallauris, Alpes-Maritimes. In his obituary the Journal de Lyon wrote, \\"He made his life into two parts, one was industry and the other was humanity\\". Michel Chevalier said of him that few French people were so well known abroad. He had received decorations from Austria, Bavaria, Denmark, Prussia, Sardinia, Saxony, Sweden and Tuscany. He was a Commander of the Legion of Honour and a member of the L‚ÄôAcad√©mie des Sciences, Belles-Lettres et Arts de Lyon. His firm lasted until 2013, called in turn Chabri√®res-Morel from 1885, then Morel- Journel & Cie from 1930.

The House of Lords unanimously struck out the claim as disclosing no justiciable cause of action, upholding the decision of the judge at first instance and of the Court of Appeal. The claim was struck out on the alternative bases of (i) the police owed no specific duty of care to a member of the general public, and (ii) on public policy grounds. Facts Between 1975 and 1980, Peter Sutcliffe killed 13 young women and attempted to kill seven others. His last victim, Jacqueline Hill, a 20-year-old student at Leeds University, was murdered in Leeds on 17 November 1980. Sutcliffe had been arrested for drunk-driving in April 1980. While awaiting trial for this, he killed two more women (including Hill) and attacked three others who survived. He was eventually arrested in January 1981. In her claim, Ms Hill's mother pointed to extensive failings on the part of West Yorkshire Police in relation to its investigation of the murders, and in particular officers' fixation upon a message purportedly from the killer which was later shown to be a hoax. Police officers interviewed Sutcliffe as a suspect nine times during their investigation. A number of the same failings would be highlighted subsequently in the Byford Report. This included a letter sent by one Trevor Birdsall, a long-time associate of Sutcliffe, who stated that Sutcliffe had a fixation with prostitutes and that Birdsall had reason to believe he might be the killer. Although Birdsall's letter was sent after Hill's death, it was ignored for months, which was seen as symptomatic of the systemic failings of the investigation. Because the application was made to strike out on the basis that there was no cause of action, the courts proceeded on the hypothetical assumption that these criticisms were all true, but without making any findings of act in that regard. The Chief Constable was named as defendant in the action pursuant to section 48(1) of the Police Act 1964. Judgment=House of Lords= The lead decision was given by Lord Keith of Kinkel. After reviewing the background facts, Lord Keith reviewed the law, and noted that there was no question that a police officer may be liable in tort to a person who is injured as a direct result of their acts or omissions. He further noted that under the common law, police officers owe to the general public a duty to enforce the criminal law (R v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis, Ex parte Blackburn [1968] 2 QB 118), enforceable by an action for mandamus. However, he went on to note, \\"a chief officer of police has a wide discretion as to the manner in which the duty is discharged. It is for him to decide how available resources should be deployed, whether particular lines of inquiry should or should not be followed and even whether or not certain crimes should be prosecuted.\\"[1989] AC 53 at 59E. Accordingly, while a chief police officer has an obligation to enforce the law, there were no specific requirements as to the manner in which they must do so. He then reviewed the position in relation to establishing a duty of care. He noted that it \\"has been said almost too frequently to require repetition that foreseeability of likely harm is not in itself a sufficient test of liability in negligence. Some further ingredient is invariably needed to establish the requisite proximity of relationship between plaintiff and defendant, and all the circumstances of the case must be carefully considered and analysed in order to ascertain whether such an ingredient is present.\\"[1989] AC 53 at 60B. He then considered at length the decision in . He noted that the two cases were similar, but held that no duty of care arose between Yorkshire Police and Ms Hill. He held: He went on to state: He held that as a general matter of public policy, the police should not owe a duty to the public at large in tort to apprehend criminals expeditiously, for \\"the imposition of liability may lead to the exercise of a function being carried on in a detrimentally defensive frame of mind.\\"[1989] AC 53 at 63D. Further, he was concerned about the time and manpower it would take for the police to defend such claims.[1989] AC 53 at 63G. Lord Templeman gave a short concurring judgment. In his characteristic fashion, Lord Templeman opened with an emotional statement: \\"The appellant, Mrs. Hill, is tormented with the unshakeable belief that her daughter would be alive today if the respondent the West Yorkshire police force had been more efficient. That belief is entitled to respect and understanding. Damages cannot compensate for the brutal extinction of a young life.\\"[1989] AC 53 at 64C. However, he too concurred that no duty of care arose. His judgment emphasised much more strongly the public policy element; he expressed concern that the court \\"would have to decide whether an inspector is to be condemned for failing to display the acumen of Sherlock Holmes and whether a constable is to be condemned for being as obtuse as Dr. Watson.\\"[1989] AC 53 at 64F. Significance The United Kingdom Supreme Court reviewed the decision in , coincidentally also a claim against West Yorkshire Police. The court held that Hill did not confer generally immunity upon the police, only that a duty of care would not arise without special circumstances. Where the police themselves had created the danger, then they would have a duty of care. Commentators suggest that the later decisions \\"made significant inroads\\" into the general public policy exclusion in Hill. See also *English tort law * Warren v.

Two well-known examples of such unwanted effects are flicker and stroboscopic effect. The term ‚Äòflicker‚Äô refers to directly visible light modulations at relatively low frequencies (< 80 Hz) and small modulation levels. ‚ÄòStroboscopic effect‚Äô is the effect which may become visible for a person when a moving object is illuminated by modulated light at somewhat higher frequencies (>80 Hz) and larger modulation levels. __TOC__  Relevance  Various scientific committees have assessed the potential health, performance and safety-related aspects resulting from temporal light modulations.IEEE Std 1789:2015, IEEE Recommended Practices for Modulating Current in High-Brightness LEDs for Mitigating Health Risks to Viewers (link).SCENIHR (Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks), Health effects of artificial light, 19 March 2012 ()SCHEER (EC Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks), Final Opinion on potential risks to human health of Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs), June 2018 . TLAs must be limited to certain levels to avoid annoyance due to the direct visibility by humans and to prevent potential health issues. After longer exposure, TLAs may reduce task performance and cause fatigue. Possible health effects for specific persons are photosensitive epileptic seizure,Photosensitive epilepsy migraine and aggravation of autistic behavior. The incorrect perception of the motion of an object due to stroboscopic effect may be unacceptable in working environments with fast moving or rotating machinery.Dangers stroboscopic effect.  TLA phenomena  Temporal Light Artefacts (TLAs) are generally unwanted effects that may be perceived by humans due to the fact that the light output of a lighting equipment varies with time. Different TLA phenomena, the associated terms and definitions and their visibility aspects are given in a technical note of CIE; see CIE TN 006:2016.CIE TN 006:2016, Visual Aspects of Time-Modulated Lighting Systems ‚Äì Definitions and Measurement Models (pdf). In CIE TN 006:2016 three types of TLAs are distinguished: * Flicker refers to unacceptable (irritating) light variation of a light source that is perceived by an average person, either directly or via a reflecting surface ; * Stroboscopic effect is an unwanted effect which may become visible for an average person when a moving or rotating object is illuminated by a time-modulated light source; * Phantom array effect (or ghosting) may be perceived by an average person when making an eye saccade over a small light source having a periodic fluctuation, the light source is then perceived as a series of spatially extended light spots. Further background and explanations on the different TLA phenomena are given in a recorded webinar ‚ÄúIs it all just flicker?‚Äù.D. Sekulovski, Recording of webinar ‚ÄúIs it all just flicker?‚Äù (YouTube) Models for the visibility of flicker and stroboscopic effect from the temporal behavior of luminous output of LEDs are in the doctoral thesis of PerzM. Perz, Modelling visibility of temporal light artefacts, thesis Eindhoven University of Technology, 05/02/2019 () .  Root causes  The root cause of TLAs is the variation of the light intensity of lighting equipment. Important factors that can contribute and that determine the magnitude and type of light modulation of lighting equipment are: *Light source technology:Overview lighting technologies and applications LEDs do not intrinsically produce temporal modulation; they just reproduce the input current waveform very well, and any ripple in the current waveform is reproduced by a light ripple because LEDs have a fast response; therefore compared to conventional lighting technologies (incandescent, fluorescent), for LED lighting more variety in the TLA properties is seen. * Power source technology (driver, electrical ballast): Many types and topologies of LED drivers and electrical ballasts are applied; simpler electronics and limited or no buffer capacitors often result in larger residual current ripple and thus larger temporal light modulation. * Light regulation: Dimming technologies of either externally applied dimmers (incompatible dimmers) or internal light-level regulators may have a large impact.; the level of temporal light modulation generally increases at lower light levels. * Mains voltage fluctuations: Electrical mains voltage variationsPower-line flicker. are caused by switching or varying loads of electrical apparatus connected to the mains network, or may be intentionally applied e.g. for power-line communication. * Visible light communication technologies: Intentional temporal light modulations like LiFi can be applied, e.g. for communication purposes; these additional TLMs may give rise to unwanted TLAs.  Metrics  Several simple metrics such as Modulation Depth, Flicker Index and Flicker Percentage are often used to assess the acceptability of flicker.Note - In many cases it has not always been made clear for which phenomenon exactly these metrics and associated limit levels were actually used. The same term flicker is often applied for the root cause (the light modulation) and for unwanted visibility effects (flicker and stroboscopic effect), but also for interference phenomena (TLI) of equipment like cameras. None of these metrics are suitable to objectively assess the visibility and acceptability of TLAs by humans. Human perception of TLAs is impacted by various factors: modulation depth, frequency, wave shape and duty cycle. More advanced metrics have been developed and validated to objectively assess the visibility of TLAs: * for flicker, the short-term flicker indicator PstLM, * for stroboscopic effect, the stroboscopic effect visibility measure SVM. For flicker also two alternative measures are derived to measure its visibility, the Flicker Visibility Measure FVM and the Time domain Flicker Visibility Measure TFVM. NOTE - The application of the SVM-metric is limited for human perception of stroboscopic effect in normal application environments (residential, office) where the speed of movement of persons and/or objects is limited. For phantom array effect no metric has been defined yet.  Measurement methods = Standardised test and measurement methods = * Measurement of PstLM, and optionally testing effect of mains voltage fluctuations or dimming: see IEC TR 61547-1, edition 3;IEC TR 61547-1 (ed. 3), Equipment for general lighting purposes ‚Äì EMC immunity requirements ‚Äì Part 1: An objective light flickermeter and voltage fluctuation immunity test method.[https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/64795] * Measurement of SVM, and optionally testing effect of dimming: see IEC TR 63158;IEC TR 63158:2018 + COR 1, Equipment for general lighting purposes ‚Äì Objective test method for stroboscopic effects of lighting equipment, 2018-03-19. * TLA: Test Methods and Guidance for Acceptance Criteria, see NEMA 77-2017NEMA 77-2017, Temporal Light Artifacts: Test Methods and Guidance for Acceptance Criteria. = Recommended limits = Recommended limits for the TLA phenomena flicker and stroboscopic effect are in NEMA 77-2017 publication. = Improper use of cameras for TLA assessment = If smart-phone phone cameras, video cameras or film cameras are used in presence of temporally modulated light, a variety of artefacts may be seen on the picture or on the recording, e.g. vertical or horizontal banding with varying brightness (this category of unwanted effects is temporal light interference - TLI). However, the type of artefact depends very much on the camera technology and camera settings. Different camera‚Äôs will show different artefacts depending on type of shutter, picture frame rate and on the mitigation measures taken in the camera. Apart from the possible variety of effects that can be seen, there is also a difference between what people perceive directly compared to what people perceive via a camera and display or monitor.Temporal light interference of cameras. Hence, usage of common cameras is not a valid and objective means to assess the potential TLA from lighting equipment.

Accusations of sexual assault in the industry go back to 1921, and during the last decades they have gained strength due to the accusations against producers, directors, actors and related publicists. Speculation about sexual assault in the industry grew in 1977, when director Roman Polanski left the United States after being convicted on charges of sexual abuse against a minor. In October 2017, the issue gained extensive media coverage after producer Harvey Weinstein was accused of sexual abuse by more than 80 women. The accusations of Weinstein led to dozens of men and women to publicly begin to denounce sexual aggressions, in what became known as the Weinstein effect and the Me Too movement. Some actors in the medium joined the protest and became sensitized with the victims. The subject is of ongoing general interest to the public and continues to feed public opinion, and moreover has served to heighten public awareness and interest in general industry trends that allow events such as these to happen. The public has began to increasingly look at not only the constraints that women are placed in but also the way the legal system only strengthens these constraints though contracts and such in Hollywood. Fatty Arbuckle case The first mediatic case occurred on September 5, 1921, when comic actor Roscoe Arbuckle was accused of sexual abuse against actress Virginia Rappe. Arbuckle had organized a party in which, it was alleged, he took advantage of Rappe's drunkenness to rape her. The aggression was so violent that Rappe died four days later. The news coverage reached such a pitch that journalist and newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst wrote columns in which he directly accused Arbuckle and added details to the event, such as that Arbuckle had raped Rappe with a bottle. Arbuckle was the defendant in three widely publicized trials for the rape of Rappe, and after the first two trials, which resulted in hung juries, Arbuckle was acquitted in the third trial and received a formal written statement of apology from the jury. Despite Arbuckle's acquittal, the scandal was enough to end his career. Reported cases=Roman Polanski case= Roman Polanski In 1977, Samantha Gailey, then 13 years old, accused director Roman Polanski of forcing her to have sex with him. Gailey described that the director took her to the house of actor Jack Nicholson in Los Angeles, under the argument of wanting her as a model for a photo shoot for Vogue magazine. There, Polanski supplied quaaludes and later photographed her topless. Both were alone in Nicholson's house, so Polanski took advantage to take her to the master bedroom and then rape her. Polanski was accused of sexual abuse of a minor, drug use, perversion and sodomy. The prosecution ordered 90 days of state prison that included a psychiatric evaluation, while deliberating the final sentence. However, Polanski requested another 90-day probation period to finish a then-current project, which was granted. After filming finished, the director returned to the United States for his evaluation period and was released after 42 days. However, Polanski fled to Europe before his sentencing, after reportedly learning that the judge in the case would renege on a probation agreement and instead impose a jail sentence. Polanski settled in his native France where his French nationality prevented him from being extradited to the United States. The Polanski case sparked the interest of the American media who condemned the actions of the French authorities. In March 2003, during the 75th Academy Awards ceremony, Polanski was awarded the Academy Award for Best Director for the film The Pianist; Polanski did not attend. Attendees at the ceremony gave the director a standing ovation despite being absent. In September 2009, he was arrested at the Z√ºrich Airport in Switzerland at the request of American authorities on the Samantha Gailey case, however, the following year, the Justice Department announced that Switzerland would not extradite Polanski. In 2016, the Supreme Court of Poland also refused to reopen the case. In 2017, Gailey herself asked to close the case, arguing that she only preferred to \\"turn the page.\\" In 2010, Charlotte Lewis, accused Polanski of predatory sexual conduct against her when she was 16 years old, claiming that Polanski insisted that she sleep with him in return for casting her in Pirates. In December 2016, the Supreme Court of Poland rejected an request for Polanski's extradition. Polanski is a dual citizen of France and Poland, and lived in France, which does not extradite its citizens. =Woody Allen case= Woody Allen in 2015 In 1978, actress Mia Farrow and her husband Andr√© Previn adopted Soon-Yi Previn, born in Seoul. After Farrow's divorce from Previn, she began a relationship with film director Woody Allen. In Dec 1987 Farrow and Allen had a son, Satchel, who would later go by the name Ronan Farrow. Farrow had adopted two other children by herself: Moses in 1978 and Dylan in 1985. Allen would co-adopt them in December 1991. In January 1992, a crisis in the relationship between Farrow and Allen appeared when Farrow discovered Allen and her oldest daughter Soon- Yi were having an affair, which the couple admitted. Later that year, on August 17, Allen issued a statement saying that he was in love with Previn and the affair still existed. The relationship between Woody Allen and Soon Yi Previn had started in December 1991, when Soon-Yi was 21 years old. The discovery of their affair sparked a dispute over custody of the younger children Satchel (later: Ronan), Dylan and Moses in the course of which an allegation of sexual abuse against Woody Allen arose. While the parties were negotiating how to resolve custody of the children, they had agreed that Woody Allen could make supervised visits to the minors, always in the presence of a caretaker designated by Mia Farrow. On August 4, 1992, Farrow received Allen in her Connecticut holiday home, and went shopping with a friend leaving 7-year-old Dylan and 4-year-old Satchel under the care of two babysitters who had express instructions never to leave the children alone, and accompanied by other nanny and the three children of her friend Casey Pascal; Moses farrow, who was then 14 years old, had not left with his mother either. According to a later statement, although no one observed that day that Allen or Dylan left the group, retracing their steps the babysitters concluded that there may have been a period of 10 or 20 minutes in which they were neither with Dylan nor Allen. At this point Allen was alleged to have taken Dylan to a crawl space behind Mia Farrow's bedroom closet and would have sexually abused her. The police investigation began several days later, after a pediatrician whom Mia had taken Dylan to had informed the police (as required by law). The State Police and Connecticut Attorney's Office referred Dylan to the Child Sexual Abuse Clinic at Yale-New Haven Hospital to determine if she had been sexually abused. After a six month investigation, the Yale‚ÄìNew Haven Hospital's Children's Sexual Abuse Clinic concluded that Dylan was not sexually abused by Allen and that Dylan‚Äôs statements did not refer to actual events that occurred to her. They stated that the allegation was likely a combination of emotional distress and coaching by her mother. The allegation was also investigated by New York Social Services, which concluded that there was no credible evidence of abuse, and by the New York Supreme Court in the custody case, which dismissed the abuse allegation. In the closing statements of the custody trials Mia Farrow's attorney Eleanor Alter acknowledged the possibility that the allegation of abuse was all Dylan's fantasies, but that Dylan still believed it had actually happened. When she was 28, Dylan Farrow repeated the assault allegation in February 2014 in an open letter in The New York Times blog of Nicholas Kristof, a family friend, stating: \\"When I was seven years old, Woody Allen took me by the hand and took me to a dark attic on the second floor of our house. He told me to lie on my stomach and play with my brother's electric train. Then he abused me sexually, he spoke to me while he was doing it, whispering to me that I was a good girl, that this was our secret and he promised me that we would go to Paris and I would become a movie star.\\" Although Allen has denied the allegation against him, his son Ronan Farrow defended his sister. He became one of the main activists against sexual abuse and one of the first to write a report about the sexual abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein, leading to the Weinstein effect and the Me Too movement. Their older brother, Moses Farrow, who was 14 years old in 1992 made an open letter saying that he was in the house that day and he never lost sight of Allen and Dylan and there was no sexual abuse, that the allegation was a fabrication by Mia Farrow and there had never been an electric train set in the attic, like Dylan had claimed. Allen has been married to Soon-Yi since 1997. Since then the story has unfolded with many other nuances as well. Soon- Yi has released a statement to the press amongst the allegations against Allen, saying that Mia Farrow, the mother, had been abusive and emotionally unstable in the household. She went on to give a controversial expose to the New York Times about the abusive household with Mia Farrow, causing some of the Farrow children to speak out against Allen and Soon-Yi. After the 2017 accusations, actors such as Griffin Newman, Ellen Page, Evan Rachel Wood, David Krumholtz, Greta Gerwig, Mira Sorvino, Rebecca Hall, Timoth√©e Chalamet, Rachel Brosnahan, Natalie Portman, Colin Firth, Marion Cotillard, Chlo√´ Sevigny, Joaquin Phoenix, Hayley Atwell, Peter Sarsgaard, Elle Fanning, and Michael Caine publicly expressed their regret for having worked with Allen; with Newman, Hall, Chalamet and Fanning saying they would donate their earnings from Allen's film A Rainy Day in New York (2018) to charities. On the other hand, actors Diane Keaton, Alec Baldwin, Jeff Goldblum, and Cherry Jones and actress Scarlett Johansson came out in his defense. Convictions and alleged abuses Bryan Singer Marc Collins-Rector Victor Salva In April 2014, Michael F. Egan claimed that his acting career was cut short in 1999 when he refused to continue attending \\"parties\\" held by powerful men from the film industry. Egan publicly denounced Bryan Singer, director of films like The Usual Suspects and the X-Men film series of abusing him in those parties that took place inside a mansion in Los Angeles and whose requirement for men was not to wear a swimsuit and swim completely naked. According to his testimony, when he was 15 years old, Singer raped him after forcing him to inhale cocaine. Egan explained that both Singer and other men threatened him and his family under the argument that they controlled Hollywood, and that they added: \\"If you do not keep the members of this group happy, we will eliminate you.\\" Singer denied the accusations, however, in 2017 another man identified as C√©sar S√°nchez-Guzm√°n said that the director forced him to perform oral sex on him in 2003. S√°nchez-Guzm√°n claimed to the New York Times that Singer organized parties aimed at the gay community in Hollywood and that he had threatened to \\"ruin his reputation if he ever spoke.\\" Egan also accused Garth Ancier, former president of BBC America, David Neuman, former president of Disney Channel, and Gary Goddard, a Broadway producer, of participating in the violations. Jeff Herman, his attorney, said: \\"Hollywood has a problem with the sexual exploitation of children.\\" During 2011, photographs showing a party organized by Singer and director Roland Emmerich showing a pool where mature and young men shared were shown. In November 2017, actor Corey Feldman expressed his interest to make a documentary that portrays pedophilia in Hollywood and the \\"sectors of power\\" within the industry. Feldman alleged that he suffered sexual abuse within what he described as a \\"network of prostitution.\\" Feldman said he would seek the money to hire lawyers to back them up, since the material to be published would make a direct statement against \\"six main Hollywood producers who would seek to deny it.\\" Feldman also said that actor Corey Haim, who was one of his friends and who died in 2010 from an drug overdose, had died without being able to confess to the public the name of the person who raped him when both were looking for a job opportunity. Feldman had already participated in the 2014 documentary An Open Secret, which exhibited the sexual abuse committed during the casting and the recruitment of young actors in movies or commercials, by the people of the film industry. The documentary also makes multiple references to the accusations against Singer, and the opinions of the children's parents, who at some point saw themselves in the need to \\"trust\\" the agents for the means to improve their economic condition. Similarly, the case of photographer Bob Villard was exposed in the material. According to the statements, Villard took photographs of children and adolescents and then sold them without permission or authorization from parents through the eBay portal as erotic content. Among the defendants were also Martin Weiss, manager of child actors who was arrested in 2011. Despite denying having sexual acts with minors, a recording showed that Weiss had confessed to \\"being with a child.\\" The recording was made by Jason James Murphy, who stated that in 1996 when he was eleven years old and Weiss was his manager, the man took him to a field where he asked him \\"if he had seen someone's penis,\\" then he abused him. Weiss was sentenced to 15 years in prison, a sentence he ultimately did not fully serve. The accusations also reached the producer Marc Collins-Rector, friend of Singer, who was accused of sexual abuse against boys and adolescents. Collins-Rector achieved a judicial agreement and moved to the Dominican Republic. In other cases, actor Jeffrey Jones was arrested in 2003 after forcing a 14-year-old boy to pose nude for him; Jones did not deny the accusations. In the 1980s, Victor Salva (director of Jeepers Creepers) served 15 months in prison for abusing one of his actors, a 12-year-old boy, and for forcing him to have oral sex with another 14-year-old boy. In 2004, the 1980s sitcom Growing Pains actor, Brian Peck, was convicted of a lewd act against a child and oral copulation of a person under 16. Brian Peck served 16 months in prison after admitting two counts of abusing a Nickelodeon child actor. He was charged with eight counts of sexual abuse, including abuse 'by anesthesia or controlled substance'. Peck was in two X-Men movies and all three Living Dead movies and is now featured in a documentary on pedophile abuse in Hollywood. Since release from prison, he has been a dialogue coach, worked on a Disney series and other projects featuring children, and claims to be friend of Charlie Sheen. Also of Growing Pains fame, executive producer Steven Marshall was sentenced to 7 1/2 years in prison for distribution of child pornography. Steven Marshall was arrested in 2009 on charges of distribution and possession of child pornography. Marshall pleaded guilty to distribution and the possession charge was dropped. Authorities say he engaged in sending and receiving child pornography and participated in online chats detailing child abduction, bondage, rapes and murders. Bob Villard, popular headshot photographer and manager who represented Tobey Maguire, Leonardo DiCaprio, Danny Nucci and other actors was charged with transportation of child pornography. Villard was accused in 2001, and charged after searches of his home uncovered thousands of photographs of boys in skimpy bathing suits posed in sexually suggestive positions, police said. He pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor and was sentenced to three years of probation. In 2005, Villard was back in court and pleaded no contest to the felony charge of committing a lewd act on a child. The victim was a 13-year-old boy who sought him out as an acting coach. Villard was given an eight-year prison sentence. =Bill Cosby case= Bill Cosby was accused of sexual abuse by around 60 women. Since 2014, around 60 women publicly accused actor and television presenter Bill Cosby who according to his statements had sexually abused them during the 1970s and 1980s. Most coincided that Cosby had drugged them to facilitate the aggression. For example, former model Janice Dickinson said that one afternoon in 1982, while suffering from intense menstrual pain, Cosby recommended a \\"pill\\" that supposedly calmed the discomfort. \\"The last thing I remember is losing consciousness and Cosby over me as the monster he is,\\" she told CNN. In the same article, Cosby is held responsible for raping a 15 year old minor. Bill Cosby faced two trials (the second still ongoing) on charges of sexual abuse. In January 2018, he joked about the issue and appeared unconcerned. Cosby and his lawyer throughout the trial relied on the image of Cosby in America's eyes and argued that the media was portraying Cosby in a light that would easily sway the jury. They also went on to say that Cosby was being discriminated against as a black man in America. Cosby continued this notion in many interviews that these allegations were based on his race in America. In December 2015, three Class II felony charges of aggravated indecent assault were filed against Cosby in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania based on allegations by Constand concerning incidents in January 2004. Cosby's first trial in June 2017 ended in a mistrial. Cosby was found guilty of three counts of aggravated indecent assault at retrial on April 26, 2018 and on September 25, 2018, Cosby was sentenced to three to ten years in state prison and fined $25,000 plus the cost of the prosecution, $43,611. Cosby appealed on June 25, 2019. Later accusations=Accusations around the 89th Academy Awards= There were two high-profile accusations around the time of the 89th Academy Awards. In October 2016, after the premiere of the movie The Birth of a Nation, its director and main actor, Nate Parker was singled out for a 1999 case, when he and his friend Jean Celestin (who co-wrote the film) were accused of sexually abusing an 18-year-old woman after drugging her. The promotion of The Birth of a Nation was involved in a climate of accusations against its director, which were credited with making the film not go beyond expectations. Actor Casey Affleck was also singled out for sexual harassment. According to reports, during the filming of the film I'm Still Here, Affleck was accused of sexually harassing Amanda White and Magdalena Gorka, producer and director of photography of the film respectively. Both parties reached an out-of-court settlement in 2010. Actress Brie Larson, who having won a year earlier the Best Actress Award at the Academy Awards, had to give the award to Affleck as Best Actor, did not applaud when the actor went on stage to collect the award. Later she would say that, \\"whatever it was that I did onstage kind of spoke for itself\\". In January 2018, Affleck declared that he would not present the Academy Award for Best Actress at the 90th Academy Awards ceremony, the reason being credited to not wanting to be the subject of attention at a time of the Me Too movement. =Allegations in 2016= In 2016, actress Tippi Hedren claimed in her autobiography that in 1963, she had been sexually harassed by film director Alfred Hitchcock during the filming of the film The Birds and that he had forbidden other male actors to approach her. At the end of 2016, it was reported that in 1972, Marlon Brando had sexually abused actress Maria Schneider during a scene from the film Last Tango in Paris. According to the reports, neither Brando nor director Bernardo Bertolucci warned the actress that she would film a sexual scene with Brando that day, leading in turn to reports that Bertolucci had \\"confessed\\" to Schneider being raped on set, prompting Bertolucci to release a statement clarifying that a simulation and not an actual intercourse took place. =Harvey Weinstein case= The Weinstein case led dozens of victims to expose their aggressions. The subject of sexual abuse in Hollywood acquired important significance in the world media in 2017, after producer Harvey Weinstein, founder of Miramax and The Weinstein Company, was accused by more than 80 women of having sexually assaulted them. The accusations ranged from sexual harassment to rape; Weinstein denied any wrongdoing. According to the women's reports, Weinstein invited young actresses or models to a hotel room or office on the pretext of discussing his career, and then demanded massages or sexual intercourse. During an audio revealed during the ensuring scandal, Weinstein can be heard pressing model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez to accompany him to take a shower, and after her refusal, the producer insists with the phrase, \\"I will not do anything to you, I swear it for my children.\\" Among the actresses who claim to have suffered harassment or rape by Weinstein are Rose McGowan, Angelina Jolie, Mira Sorvino, Paz de la Huerta, Annabella Sciorra and Gwyneth Paltrow. Another one of them, the Italian actress Asia Argento, elaborated a list in which accusations of sexual abuse against Weinstein were collected. The incidents alleged in the list date from 1980 to 2015, and include 18 complaints of rape. In them it was alleged that Weinstein conditioned important roles in films in exchange for sexual favors. As a result, The Weinstein Company and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences decided to expel Weinstein. Currently Weinstein has been charged with first and third degree rape. Harvey Weinstein was sentenced to 23 years in a maximum security prison on March 11. This has led to a larger conversation on what these implications of sexual assault have on other industries. In light of the scandal other's in varying industries have stepped forward to admit they have been sexually assaulted leading to a conversation about a culture that perpetuates this. Many have began a larger conversation in light of this huge cover up scandal about sexual assault and the nuances that lead to it. However it is worth mentioning that Harvey himself believes he is innocent. While asking his and his attorney's opinions on the decision reached by the courts they believe it was due to the peer pressure of convicting him. Harveys attorney, Rotunno says it was fueled by the pressure to charge a man with 5 accounts against him on something. She goes on to say that emotions ran high in the court room furthering the jury's pressure to convict Weinstein on something. As for the defense itself, both Weinstein and Rotunno stick to the claim that the women had consensual encounters with Weinstein showing texts between these women and Harvey that indicated potential consent. The accusations against Weinstein led to the disclosure of a considered number of victims of other sexual assaults by people in the film industry. =Kevin Spacey case= Kevin Spacey On October 30, 2017, actor Anthony Rapp stated that in 1986, while still a minor, he had been sexually harassed by actor Kevin Spacey during a party held at Spacey's home. According to the statement, Rapp was in Spacey's bedroom watching TV, when Spacey walked in drunk and laid on top of Rapp. In response to these allegations, Spacey alleged that he did not remember behaving inappropriately, and asked for forgiveness if it was so. In the same statement, Spacey publicly declared that he was gay. The accusations against Spacey were aggravated when technical staff from the television series House of Cards (which Spacey starred) declared that the actor frequently harassed men during filming. Mexican actor Roberto Cavazos also accused Spacey of harassing him. In his story he said, \\"It seems that it only took being a male under 30 to make Mr. Spacey feel free to touch us.\\" After the accusations, Spacey announced his admission to the clinic The Meadows, in Arizona, to undergo treatment for sex addiction. Netflix broke commercial ties with the actor and his participation in the film All the Money in the World was eliminated; actor Christopher Plummer had to re-shoot the scenes of Spacey's character. House of Cards later announced that its following sixth season would be the series' last, and that it would be filmed without Spacey. =#MeToo= The accusations to Harvey Weinstein unleashed a campaign through the hashtag Me Too with which different people joined the list of victims of sexual abuse by actors, directors and producers. The comedian Louis C.K. and filmmaker Brett Ratner had projects canceled after at least six accusations each; C.K. later confirmed the allegations against him and apologized, while Ratner denied the claims against him. For his part, the filmmaker James Toback had a total of 200 accusations of sexual harassment. Acting coach Anna Graham Hunter declared against the actor Dustin Hoffman claiming that in 1985 during the filming of the television film Death of a Salesman the actor groped her and harassed her with comments as when she asked him what he wanted to eat at breakfast; Hoffman replied, \\"I'll have a hard- boiled egg and a soft-boiled clitoris.\\" This accusation was soon followed by those of six other women. Hoffman later released an apology but denied wrongdoing, saying, \\"I have the utmost respect for women and feel terrible that anything I might have done could have put her in an uncomfortable situation,\\" continuing, \\"I am sorry. It is not reflective of who I am,\\" but has not publicly responded to the other six allegations. Other actors like Richard Dreyfuss, James Woods and Jeffrey Tambor denied the accusations against them. In January 2018, after winning the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor ‚Äì Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, James Franco was accused by five women, including Sarah Tither-Kaplan, who claimed that when she was a student of Franco, he forced them to undress and remove the plastic protections during the filming of sexual scenes. Franco did not attend the 23rd Critics' Choice Awards ceremony afterwards. Time magazine named the \\"Silence Breakers\\" behind the #MeToo movement Time Person of the Year in 2017. =Accusations of complicity and criticisms= Public opinion was against not only those who committed sexual abuse but those who covered or silenced it. Actors such as Matt Damon and Ben Affleck admitted knowing the sexual crimes of Weinstein. After actress Meryl Streep denied knowing the behavior of the producer, Rose McGowan, one of the victims, rebutted her arguing that Streep had knowledge and called her a \\"hypocrite.\\" On January 7, 2018, during the 75th Golden Globe Awards ceremony, the vast majority of attendees decided to wear black in solidarity with the victims. The participation of some attendees was criticized, including Streep herself, and of Oprah Winfrey, who after receiving the honorary Cecil B. DeMille Award, dedicated her speech to the victims of such aggressions. That same night, singer Seal declared that Oprah had been a friend of Weinstein and claimed that she knew his behavior. Actor Liam Neeson criticized the social movement, alleging that the accusations against his fellow actors had turned into a witch hunt, adding, \\"There are some people, famous individuals, who are suddenly accused of touching a girl's knee, or something like that, and then they are dismissed from their shows.\\" In January 2018, French actress Brigitte Bardot called \\"hypocrites\\" some of the actresses who denounced the abuses. In her statement she said, \\"There are many actresses who provoke the producers to obtain a role, then, when speaking of them, they say they were harassed.\\" =In popular culture= During the 75th Golden Globe Awards ceremony, presenter Seth Meyers said in reference to the movie The Shape of Water (directed by Guillermo del Toro): \\"When I heard that the story of an innocent woman who falls in love with a water monster was filmed, I just said, 'Oh no, not another Woody Allen movie!'\\". In 2016, the presenter of the 73rd Golden Globe Awards ceremony Ricky Gervais talked about the movie Spotlight (about a journalist team who investigated the sexual abuse scandal in Boston) thus: \\"Spotlight is the movie about how a group of sexual predators was allowed to abuse children and continue working with impunity and without punishment. Roman Polanski called it 'the best romantic comedy in history.'\\" At the 85th Academy Awards nominations ceremony in 2013, host Seth MacFarlane joked when announcing the Best Supporting Actress nominees: \\"Congratulations, you five ladies no longer have to pretend to be attracted to Harvey Weinstein.\\" Psychology and behavior The psychology center Cepsim in Madrid, Spain described in summary the profile of the abuser: \\"They are men or women with a lot of power who use it with vulnerable people to get what they want. Normally they lack empathy, which is what places us in someone else's pain and makes us not hurt or be selfish.\\" The Department of Psychology of the University of M√°laga added that the rapist does not usually assimilate that he is committing a crime, since his mind is usually narcissistic. People with media power usually present themselves with a \\"charming\\" personality, so victims are not believed. The personality of abusers in show business also has atypical behaviors such as quoting actresses and models to castings or sign contracts in unusual places such as hotel rooms or private rooms. After the abuse they resort to blackmail or a direct threat to silence the victim. Criminal law lawyer Alicia Ozores explained to the newspaper La Vanguardia that some abusers tried to take refuge under the argument that \\"they were addicted to sex\\", this in order to reduce a sentence and cleanse their image because sex addiction is a recognized disorder. Weinstein and Spacey used the argument in response to the accusations against them. According to the psychological profile of the abuser, many stalkers and rapists did not need to resort to physical violence, since they used persuasion, deception or pressure to subdue the victim, based on their authoritative relationship. In the case of child abuse itself, the rapist would be opportunistic, taking advantage of the carelessness of the parents and in this case of their desire to venture into the media. Regarding the victims, their fear is usually related to the disbelief of public opinion and to being judged by it. Usually, the society condemns the abuse but in turn questions the reason why the victim did not speak or denounce before. Brazilian psychologist Flavia Dos Santos told Colombian newspaper El Pa√≠s that victims are usually convinced to speak when they are told that their statement reduce the amount of future incidents. The victim usually feels helpless to know that his abusers are people with media power and as a result can enjoy impunity when he has public demand. Many of the later behaviors of the victims, such as guilt or disbalance in interpersonal relationships, were shown in the documentary An Open Secret, where victims narrate that sexual abuse has been assumed as part of the culture in Hollywood and for that reason nobody has worried about eradicating it. Theme in the 2016 United States presidential election Sexual abuse as a result of having a position of power was one of the issues during the 2016 United States presidential election, particularly when in October of the same year and a month before the election, an audio recording was released that dated from 2005 in which Donald Trump, then the presidential candidate for the Republican Party, was heard expressing himself in 2005 on how he used his power to \\"grab women.\\" In 2005, Trump, still removed from politics, was the judge of the television show The Apprentice, a concept he had created for NBC. In the recording Trump argued about women, \\"when you're a star, they let you do anything. Grab them by the pussy.\\" That same day, Trump gave a statement in which he apologized for the video's content, and said that \\"he was not perfect.\\" Likewise, during the third presidential debate he argued: \\"nobody respects women more than me.\\" Trump won the presidential election a month later and a year later the production company Brave New Films presented a video that compiled the testimonies of 16 women who publicly accused Trump of harassing or sexually assaulting them. In October 2017, former President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed their sympathy with victims of sexual abuse. Obama would testify about the specific behavior of Weinstein, \\"Michelle and I are disgusted by the recent reports on Harvey Weinstein; any man who degrades women in that way should be condemned and held accountable, regardless of their wealth or condition.\\" See also * Catholic Church sexual abuse cases * 2017‚Äì18 United States political sexual scandals * Casting couch * Operation Yewtree, British police investigation into sexual abuse committed by media figures References 20th- century scandals 21st-century scandals Entertainment scandals Sex crimes in the United States Sex scandals Sexual abuse cover-ups Violence against men in North America Violence against women in the United States ","title":"Sexual abuse in the American film industry"},{"id":"56531495","title":"The Biggest Little Railway in the World"},{"id":"56531497","title":"Disney Masters"},{"id":"56531506","text":"Santraƒç (, ) is a Serbian surname.

The Curse of the Braganzas (in Portuguese a Maldi√ß√£o dos Bragan√ßas) is a myth, referred to in several historical chronicles, concerning the House of Braganza, that ruled the Kingdom of Portugal (1640‚Äì1910), the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves (1815‚Äì1822) and the Empire of Brazil (1822‚Äì1889) and, therefore, all the Portuguese Overseas Empire. This \\"curse\\" began in the reign of king John IV of Portugal, in the 17th century, when the monarch allegedly kicked a Franciscan friar who was begging for Alms. In reply, the friar cast a curse, saying that never again would a first-born male of his family live long enough to reach the throne. Since then--with three exceptions--all the first- born males of this dynasty died before they reigned. With the end of the Braganzas' reigns, firstly in Brazil (1889) and later in Portugal (1910), the curse appears to have ended.

In spite of the fact that he was considered an exception to the family curse, the so-called \\"cursed prince\\" became psychological ill and tried suicide, dying single in a sanatorium in Vienna. Curiosities *One century after this curse, king John VI and his consort Charlotte of Bourbon, tried to revert it, visiting annually Franciscan monasteries first in Lisbon and later in Rio de Janeiro. \\"Convento de Santo Ant√¥nio\\", in Rio de Janeiro. *All the first-born children that died in Brazil due to the curse, were buried in ‚ÄúConvento de Santo Ant√¥nio‚Äù, a Franciscan monastery in Rio de Janeiro. *This curse also affected Pedro I of Brazil illegitimate children.

Herbert had been involved in Booth's Rebellion of 1659, and earned favour with the new king, Charles II of England, following the Restoration of the Monarchy, holding the position of Custos Rotulorum of Denbighshire until his death in 1678.

The couple had no children and the baron was succeeded by his brother. Her second husband was William O'Brien, 2nd Earl of Inchiquin. Like her first husband, the earl was a widower and some years her senior; however, he had children from his first marriage. They were married some time after 1684, but the earl, having been appointed Governor of Jamaica, died there in 1692. There were no children from their marriage. Finally, in about 1694, Elizabeth married Charles Howard, 4th Baron Howard of Escrick. About three years later, she brought divorce proceedings against him on the grounds of bigamy. It was reported to the House of Lords in 1698 that Lord Howard had been \\"ordered by the peers to waive his privilege\\" and had offered his wife terms of divorce through an intermediary, his relative Charles Howard, 3rd Earl of Carlisle. This third marriage also produced no children. Lord Howard died in 1715 and his barony became extinct. The former countess died in 1718, aged 67.

He wrote a book on the history of marine architecture, a book on Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson, and Biographia Navalis about leading figures in Britain's Royal Navy. Charnock studied at Trinity College, Oxford. He volunteered with the Royal Navy and researched historical and contemporary naval affairs. He was able to hear stories and obtain letters from his friends in the Royal Navy, especially Captain William Locker. Charnock's six-volume Biographia Navalis was published from 1794‚Äì1798. In common with William James, William Richard O'Byrne and others who attempted to make a career writing about the Royal Navy, he then encountered financial difficulty. Life He was the son of a barrister, John Charnock of Stanford-on-Soar, Nottinghamshire, and his wife Frances Boothby. He studied at Winchester College and at Trinity College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 15 December 1774.s:Alumni Oxonienses: the Members of the University of Oxford, 1715-1886/Charnock, John (1) In his student days, Charnock wrote political essays for periodicals. Then he fell out with his father over his chosen lifestyle, with his marriage as a possible further grounds for the rupture. Turning to naval interests, Charnock joined the Royal Navy as a volunteer. He became friends with Captain Locker, Nelson's correspondent and lieutenant-governor of Greenwich Hospital. Locker shared his recollections and became an important source of information for Charnock's research. After inheriting a fortune, Charnock left the navy, but had soon spent all his inheritance and turned to writing to make a living. After Biographia Navalis, Charnock wrote History of Marine Architecture in a 3 volume set published from 1801‚Äì1802. He then published a Life of Lord Nelson in 1806. Locker's letters which Charnock had paraphrased for the book were later published in Sir Harris Nicolas's book, in original form: Charnock's versions had used more genteel language, uncharacteristic of Nelson. Charnock fell into poverty. Unable to pay his debts, he died on 16 May 1807, at the King's Bench Prison, and has a slab in the old churchyard at Lee. He left behind a widow, Mary, the daughter of Peregrine Jones of Philadelphia, but no children. It was said of Mary that she showed \\"exemplary conduct in the vicissitudes of her husband's fortune\\". She died on 26 May 1836 and is buried with Charnock.

These organizations exemplify (or exemplified) a range of \\"Jewishness\\"; some are historically Jewish in origin but later became strictly secular. Some remain more celebratory of their Jewish roots from a historic perspective only, and some actively promote Jewish culture and religious traditions within their current program.An example of the former is Tau Delta Phi, a Jewish heritage fraternity that became non-sectarian in 1932. Tau Delta Phi was ethnically Jewish, but not religiously Jewish when it was founded in 1910. Its earliest members were ethnically Jewish but were from all different religious backgrounds. That Fraternity is therefore often grouped with other Jewish fraternities but has long shifted toward a primary identification as \\"secular\\". The terms \\"Fraternity\\" and \\"Sorority\\" are used somewhat interchangeably, with men's and co-ed groups always using Fraternity, and women's groups using either Fraternity or Sorority. For convenience, the term \\"Greek Letter Society\\" is a generic substitute. The word, \\"Greek,\\" in this case refers to the use of Greek Letters for each society's name, and not to Greek ethnicity. Collegiate Bold indicates active groups.

He has released on labels such as Fear of Flying, Fasten Musique Concrete and his own imprints Moscow Records, Moss Co. & Arkityp. Early career In 2008 Hamilton graduated from Oxford Brookes University with a degree in Marketing Management & following this completed an introductory production course at Point Blank Music School. His tutor was Chad Jackson, who wrote the 90's hit ‚ÄúHear The Drummer (Get Wicked)‚Äù. Here he learnt the basics of sequencing. After moving to London at the age of 18, Hamilton started out as a regular partygoer at several London venues whilst producing tracks from his bedroom. Eventually his work was noticed by the DJs playing at FUSE, a Sunday party held at the Shoreditch club, 93 Feet East. This led to him being asked to play there for the first time in 2013 and eventually becoming a resident. Record labels=Moscow Records= Moscow Records was started in December 2009 as a platform for Hamilton to release his own music. The labels first release was called ‚ÄòIntroductions EP Part 1‚Äô featuring tracks from Archie himself, Keinton & Alexqbit. This was the first in a series of EPs released focused on showcasing up and coming producers. Since then artists such as Enzo Siragusa, 100 Hz & Benson Herbert have released on the label. =Moss Co.= Established in 2013 Moss Co. was started as a new creative venture releasing more experimental music than Moscow Records. Its inception was the result of Moscow's distributor almost going into administration and the cost of pressing vinyl being too high to continue. Releases on Moss Co. have been charted by Maher Daniel, Julie Marghilano, Enzo Siragusa & Archie Hamilton. Present day In 2015 Hamilton released the commercially successful singles ‚ÄòMind Blank‚Äô and ‚ÄòWorks On Sunday‚Äô on FUSE. The summer saw the launch of a new project, ‚ÄòArkityp‚Äô with fellow FUSE London resident, Rossko, hosting five events in the summer season at Ibiza's Underground Club. Arkityp was continued as a label reserved for collaborations by Hamilton & Rossko. That year he also played at the Sonus festival in Croatia, at Gottwood and OFF Sonar. He has played at clubs in Australia, Asia and North and South America.

During their maturation in the thymus, they undergo a process called V(D)J recombination which conducts the development of T cell (TCR). The mechanism of this stochastic process enables on one hand the generation of vast repertoire of TCRs, however, on the other hand causes also origin of so called \\"autoreactive T cells\\" which recognize self antigens via their TCRs. Autoreactive T cells must be eliminated from the body or skewed into the T Regulatory cells (TRegs) lineage to prevent manifestations of autoimmunity. mTECs possess the ability to deal with these autoreactive clones via mediation of the processes of central tolerance, namely clonal deletion or T regulatory cells selection, respectively. N.B.: All the below cited references utilized mouse as a model organism.  Self-antigens generation and presentation  In 1989, two scientific groups came up with the hypothesis that the thymus expresses genes which are in the periphery, strictly expressed by specific tissues (e.g.: Insulin produced by Œ≤ cells of the pancreas) to subsequently present these so-called \\"tissue restricted antigens\\" (TRAs) from almost all parts of the body to developing T cells in order to test which TCRs recognize self-tissues and can be therefore harmful to the body. It was found, after more than a decade, that this phenomenon is managed specifically by mTECs in the thymus and was named Promiscuous gene expression (PGE). = Autoimmune regulator = Aire is a protein called autoimmune regulator (Aire) which is also specifically expressed by mTECs. and its expression is completely dependent on NF- kappa B signaling pathway. Aire recognizes target genes of TRAs via specific methylation marks and requires about 50 partner molecules for activation of their expression. Moreover, Aire-dependent activation of TRA genes expression is accompanied by formation of DNA double-strand breaks. which probably results in very short lifespan of mTECs between 2‚Äì3 days Mutations of Aire gene in human cause a rare autoimmune disorder called Autoimmune Polyendocrinopathy Candidiasis Ectodermal Distrophy (APECED)., which usually manifests in combination with other autoimmune diseases e.g.: diabetes mellitus type 1. Dysfunction of murine Aire gene results in comparable scenario and therefore mouse is used as the model organism for investigation of APECED. = mTECs in numbers = mTECs as a population are capable to express more than 19000 genes (about 80% of mouse genome) among which approximately 4000 belong to Aire-dependent TRAs. It is important to emphasize that single mTEC expresses about 150 Aire-dependent TRAs and approximately 600 Aire-independent TRAs, indicating that other still unknown PGE regulators exist. Indeed, another protein called Fezf2 was suggested to be the second regulator of PGE. It was shown that each mTEC expresses stochastically 1-3% of TRA pool. However, more recent studies discovered stable co-expression patterns between TRA genes which are localized in close proximity, suggesting \\"order in this stochastic process\\".  Tissues protection against autoreactive T cells  T cell precursors extravasate from the bloodstream in cortico-medullary junction and they first migrate to the thymic cortex, where they undergo construction of TCRs and subsequently a process called T cell positive selection which is mediated by mTEC-related cells: cortical thymic epithelial cells (cTECs). This process verifies, whether newly generated TCRs are functional. About 90% of T cells displays badly rearranged TCRs, they can¬¥t reach the positive selection and they die by neglect in the cortex. The rest starts to express CCR7, which is a receptor for mTEC-generated chemokine CCL21, and migrate after concentration gradient to the thymic medulla to encounter mTECs. = Two modes of central tolerance = mTECs are not only mediators of PGE and \\"factories of TRAs\\". They also express high levels of MHC II and costimulatory molecules CD80/CD86 and rank among efficient antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Moreover, they utilize macroautophagy to load self antigens on MHCII molecules. Thus, mTECs are capable to present self-generated TRAs on their MHC molecules to select potential autoreactive T cells. It was published that mTECs mediate clonal deletion (recessive tolerance), via presentation of TRAs, which leads to the apoptosis of autoreactive T cells, as well as they are competent to skew autoreactive T cells into TRegs, also through the presentation of TRAs, which then migrate to the periphery to protect tissues against autoreactive T cells that occasionally avoid selection processes in the thymus (dominant tolerance). How mTECs discriminate between these two modes of tolerance? It was shown that prospective TRegs interact with presented TRAs with lower affinity than those which are clonally deleted. Furthermore, it was also revealed that specific TRAs skew autoreactive T cells into TRegs with much higher efficiency than they do in the case of clonal deletion. = Antigen transfer in the thymus = mTECs form rare population which is composed of approximately 100000 cells per thymus of 2 week old mice. Thus, there is low probability of encounter between autoreactive T cell and mTEC. Unidirectional antigen transfer from mTECs to thymic dendritic cells (DCs), which itself can¬¥t express TRAs, extends the network of TRA presentation, enables TRA processing by different microenvironments and increases the probability of encounter between autoreactive T cell and its appropriate self-antigen. Moreover, DCs competently induce both recessive and dominant tolerance as well as mTECs. In contrast, another seminal study reveals that mTECs itself suffice to establish both recessive and dominant tolerance without help of additional APCs.  Development = Subsets = mTEC population is not homogenous and basically could be subdivided into more numerous population of mTECs which express low number of MHCII and CD80/CD86, namely mTECsLo and smaller population of mTECsHi which express higher amounts of these molecules. PGE regulator Aire is expressed only by part of mTECsHi. However, this claim doesn¬¥t mean that mTECsLo don¬¥t contribute to PGE, mTECsHi, especially that expressing Aire, are just much more efficient in this process. There is evidence that mTECsLo serve as precursors of mTECsHi in the embryonic thymus Nevertheless, situation changes after birth, where only part of mTECsLo pool represents immature mTECsHi reservoir and another part is constituted by mature mTECs which are specialized for expression of chemokine CCL21, discussed above. Further subset of mTECsLo pool is formed by terminally differentiated cells called Post- Aire mTECs which already downregulated the expression of Aire, MHCII and CD80/CD86. = Progenitor cells = TECs (mTECs and cTECs) originate from the third pharyngeal pouch which is a product of endoderm. Their common origin points to the fact that both mTECs and cTECs rise from one bipotent progenitor. This notion was confirmed by several studies of embryonic thymus. and was further developed by finding that these bipotent progenitors express cTEC markers. Nevertheless, another sources document existence of mTEC unipotent progenitors that express claudin 3 and 4 (Cld3/4). These two opposite findings were interfaced by observation of unipotent mTEC progenitors in the postnatal thymus that previously expressed cTEC markers and concurrently express Cld3/4. On the other hand, several other studies describe appearance of bipotent progenitors in postnatal thymus. Thus, embryonic as well as postnatal thymus might shelter both bipotent TEC or unipotent mTEC progenitors. Similarly to Aire expression, mTECs development is highly dependent on NF- kappa B signaling pathway.

Gaffney has directed research projects around the world. Most recently, he has become known for his work on Doggerland, a submerged landmass that existed in the North Sea in the early Holocene. Other recent work includes the Anglo-Austrian ‚ÄúStonehenge Hidden Landscapes Project\\", The Curious Travellers Project, the Adriatic islands Project, and the pit alignment at Warren Fields He was Co-PI on the EPSRC GG-TOP Gravity Gradient Project. Other fieldwork has included analysis of Roman villas on the Berkshire Downs (UK), survey at Roman Wroxeter, Diocletian's Palace, the Cetina Valley in Croatia, Forum Novum and Cyrene, Libya.  Early life and education  Born 25 February 1958 in Newcastle upon Tyne, Gaffney was educated at Westgate (Arthurs) Hill School and Rutherford Comprehensive School. His interest in archaeology originated during his days at Westgate Hill Primary School in Newcastle upon Tyne: as part of an annual school trip, his class were taken to the Roman Wall, visiting sites such as the Mithraeum at Carrawbrughs and the forts at Chesters and Housesteads. Encouraged by a grandfather with similar interests, he was fortunate enough to attend the Vindolanda excavations - sponsored by Rutherford Comprehensive - where he experienced archaeology first hand and met Robin and Anthony Birley on the site. His brother Christopher Gaffney also became an archaeologist. His undergraduate and postgraduate degrees were taken at the Department of Archaeology at the University of Reading. Taking his first degree at the University of Reading, he studied with Richard Bradley, Michael Fulford and Robert Chapman and cut his archaeological teeth in field schools at sites including the Roman town at Silchester and the prehistoric enclosure at South Lodge. His PhD at Reading was on the archaeology of the island of Hvar in Croatia.  Career  Calleva Atrebatum - Amphitheatre = 1980s = Having spent some time working with Julian Richards on his Berkshire Barrows Project, Gaffney followed Julian after graduation to the newly formed Wessex Archaeology Unit to work on the Stonehenge Environs Project. In 1981 he returned to Berkshire to work on the Maddle Farm Project with Martin (Mog) Tingle. The Maddle Farm Project was a survey aimed at studying the prehistoric and Roman settlement of the Berkshire Downs and gained some recognition for its detailed reconstruction of the economy of a single villa at Maddle Farm from the distribution of surface artefacts. Following work at Maddle Farm, from 1983 Gaffney worked at Bordesley Abbey and at the Forge Mill Museum in Redditch. In 1985 he decided to return to academic archaeology and to take a PhD, initially with John Bintliff and Bo≈æidar Slap≈°ak. Funded by the British Council, as a bilateral agreement with Yugoslavia, and then the British Academy, he intended to work on the hillfort at Rodik on the Slovenian karst. As this was not possible he moved his research area to the island of Hvar and to work with Branko Kirigin and Nik≈°a Vujnonoviƒá. Together they surveyed the archaeological sites of the island and this work contributed to his PhD, submitted under Fulford at the University of Reading. = 1990s = Tor on Hvar, Croatia The development of Gaffney's PhD into a larger project was delayed by the fragmentation of Yugoslavia and the war leading to the independence of Croatia. However, during this period, the Eastern Hvar survey, led by Tim Kaiser, Branko Kirigin and John Hayes, was reformulated into the Adriatic Islands Project in 1991/2 . The project aimed to study settlement associated with the peculiar arrangement of the coastline in central Dalmatia. Here, the myriad of small islands and good harbours provided numerous opportunities for interaction and the region has easy access south to Greece, north to the Po valley. The string of islands also enables \\"line of sight\\" travel from the Balkan coast to Italy. Despite the war, the Adriatic Island Project continued to operate through to 1996 and surveyed archaeological sites across Braƒç (with Zoran Stanƒçiƒç), ≈†olta, Vis, Palagru≈æa and many smaller islands. The results demonstrated the role of long-distance contacts in settlement development, plus the nature of direct intervention and colonisation, either by expansive local groups or major colonial powers including Greek city states or Rome. The project undertook excavations at Grabƒçeva ≈†pilja, the Greek colony at Pharos, Krajcina Spilja and the hilltop enclosure at ≈†krip. It was during this project that Gaffney was attracted to the use of geographic information systems (GIS) for archaeological analysis. After working for a brief time with Fred Limp and Ishmael Williams at the Arkansas Archaeological Survey, later CAST, he and Zoran Stanƒçiƒç, then a PhD student at Ljubljana, published one of the first extensive archaeological publicationsin Europe using GIS and data from the island of Hvar. In 1992, Gaffney was employed at the University of Birmingham, rising from a research fellow at the Birmingham University Field Archaeology Unit (BUFAU) ‚Äì later Birmingham Archaeology. During this time, he established archaeological computing, in academic terms, at the department. In 1996 he received funding from the Leverhulme Trust to study the Roman town at Wroxeter, Viriconium Cornoviorum. As part of a team with Simon Buteux, Roger White, Martin van Leusen and Christopher Gaffney, the Wroxeter Hinterland Project undertook the first complete geophysical survey of a complete Roman Town in Britain, in collaboration with researchers from across the world. The University of Birmingham was awarded the Queen's Anniversary Prize in 1996 for this research. At the end of the 90s, Gaffney, with Ron Yorston, Ann Woodward and Sally Exon, undertook the Stonehenge Landscapes Project using java-applets to explore the GIS data from a major digital landscape study of the Stonehenge Landscape, incorporating tens of thousands of GIS viewsheds as part of the interactive publication. = 2000s = During the first decade of the 21st century Vince Gaffney was increasingly engaged within academic management. After initially taking a part-time lectureship in the Department of Ancient History and Archaeology at Birmingham, he was given a Chair in Landscape Archaeology and Geomatics in 2004. Between 2002 and 2015 he founded, and was Director of, a larger academic grouping entitled the Institute of Archaeology and Antiquity (now the Department of Classics, Ancient History and Archaeology). Between 2008-11, he was Director of Research and Knowledge Transfer within the newly formed College of Arts and Law at the University of Birmingham. Recognising the increasing significance of visualisation within the Humanities as well as science, he, with Paul Hatton and Glynn Barratt, founded the Visual and Spatial Technology Centre (VISTA) at Birmingham. At its peak VISTA carried out multiple, global digital projects, and staff trained in the centre now work in many digital or academic groups. Vincent Gaffney in Trogir, during survey in the Cetina Valley (Croatia) Several major projects were undertaken during this time and included the study of the Warren Field pit alignment, landscape management at Fort Hood, in Texas, with Cheryl Huckerby and work with Paul Robertson and Helen Patterson at Forum Novum in the Sabina, Italy. As part of a collaboration with Ante Miloseviƒá, an Anglo- Croatian team began a project to carry out work in the extensively waterlogged Sinj field in the Cetina valley in Croatia. This acted as a logical extension of the Adriatic islands Project onto the Croatian mainland. The initial field seasons provided exceptional results in a pilot study, but were not taken further. Returning to Stonehenge, Gaffney worked with Wolfgang Neubauer and the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Archaeological Prospection and Virtual Archaeology on the ‚ÄúStonehenge Hidden Landscapes Project\\". This project undertook extensive multi-technique, geophysical and remote sensing survey in the landscape around Stonehenge. The results of surveys at the ‚Äúsuper-henge‚Äù at Durrington Walls exposed new evidence for the development of the massive earthwork, including a series of massive features beneath the bank of the site. Initially thought to be stones, excavation with Mike Parker-Pearson demonstrated these to be evidence for a previously unknown ring of massive posts. This joint project was later judged to be the 2017 Current Archaeology Research Project of the year. Early Holocene landscape features mapped by the North Sea Palaeolandscapes Project. From 2003, Gaffney was increasingly concerned with Doggerland and the landscapes inundated by the North Sea following global climate change and sea level rise at the end of the last Ice Age. Initially begun as a joint PhD project, co-supervised by Ken Thomson and with Simon Fitch as student, this project sought to use seismics, collected by the energy sector, to trace the outlines of the early Holocene landscapes associated with the southern North Sea and the Dogger Banks. Following the success of this pilot study, supported by Petroleum Geo-Services, the project was extended as the North Sea Palaeolandscapes Project (NSPP). Following funding by the Aggregates Levy (English Heritage) and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, the project mapped c. 43,000 square kilometres of early Mesolithic landscape beneath the North Sea. This work was extended to the Severn Estuary and Liverpool Bay as the Anglo-Welsh, West Coast Palaeolandscapes Project. = 2010s = The unique nature of the marine research undertaken in the North Sea, and the significance of this research, was recognised by the awarding of the European Archaeological Heritage Prize to Gaffney in 2013. Following this, a smaller project piloting the extraction of sedimentary DNA from the underwater site at Bouldnor Cliff provided evidence that DNA might be preserved in marine environments and thus provide a unique paleo-environmental record. At Bouldnor, the unexpected presence of wheat DNA in sediments dated to c. 6,000 BC caused some controversy. Currently, the presence of such material is probably explained as the product of pioneer events in advance of the spread of agriculture, and that such data are either not preserved, or present, within the terrestrial record and away from the coast. In 2014, staffing and the capacity to undertake large-scale archaeological research withered at Birmingham following restructuring of the department, and Gaffney accepted the position of Anniversary Chair in Landscape Archaeology at the University of Bradford. Shortly after this, in 2015, he was awarded an ERC European Advanced Grant for ‚ÄúEurope's Lost Frontiers\\" (2015-2020). The project has continued to map the prehistoric landscapes of Doggerland, but has used these data to direct a programme of extensive coring of marine palaeochannels. Material from the cores has provided sedimentary DNA, as well as conventional environmental data, and these will be used in a major computational modelling programme replicating colonisation of the submerged landscape.

Its colour is light reddish-brown, sometimes a pale band around the periphery and occasionally a narrow darker band at the sutures. Its 5 whorls are lightly rounded, the last longer than the spire. The protoconch consists of two whorls, somewhat globose, smooth and polished. The apical whorl is oblique to the succeeding whorl. Sculpture : The penultimate whorl shows six to seven and the body whorl sixteen to twenty spiral riblets, seven or eight of which are in front of the aperture. They are slightly variable in strength, some in breadth equal to the interspaces, others rather narrower. Also an occasional small thread here and there arises in the interspaces. The longitudinal ribs are irregular, low and rounded, more distinct on the spire, and frequently obsolete. The growth striae are irregular, somewhat marked, and frequently cutting up the spirals into minute gemmules. The sutures are impressed, usually margined with a wider riblet.

Muchu Chhish is one of the tallest mountains on Earth that remain unclimbed and is the tallest one of all that is not off limits due to religious or political prohibitions. The peak has a modest prominence however, rising only above the nearest col or pass. One of the longest glaciers outside the polar regions, Batura Glacier flanks Muchu Chhish to the north. Attempts to climb Muchu Chhish have been by the south ridge. This ridge was climbed by a Polish expedition in 1983 using fixed ropes while making the first ascent of Batura IV (7531 metres (24,708 ft)) which is west of Muchu Chhish. The most notable attempt on Muchu Chhish was by a Spanish expedition in 1999 which reached 6650 m (21,817 ft) on the south ridge.

Early life  Miles was born on 23 March 1968 in Temora, New South Wales to Jennifer Jessica Miles (n√©e Cook) and Michael John Miles. The family settled in Sydney in 1970 when Miles was two, where they remained for the next nine years. Heart disease plagued Michael Miles throughout his son's childhood, and a number of strokes and heart attacks progressively disabled his father, Miles became more intimately involved with his care. Miles credits this experience, and his father's premature death at forty-four in 1979, with his interest in disability medical research. Following his father's death, the family moved to the Gold Coast, where Miles attended Keebra Park State High School, graduating in 1985.  Veterinary career  Miles studied veterinary science at The University of Queensland from 1986-1991. Upon graduating, he spent two years in Mosman and Lane Cove working with Stephen Van Mil, an Australian veterinarian who later became a well-known television and film personality. Miles subsequently lived and worked across numerous veterinary placements in the UK before moving to Singapore in 2000 with his wife, Caroline. On returning to Sydney in 2003, he continued to practice as a veterinarian until 2007, when he decided to pursue his interest in community engagement, fundraising and disability medical research.  Medical research  From 2007 to 2012, Miles served as Director of External Relations at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) Medicine,http://blogs.unsw.edu.au/foundation/files/2011/06/FP-201102-UNSW- Medicine1.pdf while obtaining a Masters of Business Administration degree there.

In 2017, MSRA also co-funded a three-year, $750 000 MS research fellowship for the University of Tasmania's Menzies Institute for Medical Research.

He is generally held to be the author of the abbey's own chronicle, which was published in 1914 as the Ledger of Vale Royal Abbey. Owing to a failure to finish the abbey's building works‚Äîwhich had commenced in 1277 and had been intermittently on-going ever since‚Äîthe abbey was unsightly, and the monks' quarters probably near derelict. Abbot Peter oversaw the transplantation of the house onto new grounds. Much of his career, however, was focussed on defending his abbey's feudal lordship over its tenants. The dispute between the abbey and its tenantry had existed since the abbey's foundation; the abbot desired to enforce his feudal rights, the serfs to reject them, as they claimed to be by then freemen. This did not merely involve Abbot Peter defending the privileges of his house in the courts. Although there was much litigation, with the Abbot having to defend himself to the Justice of Chester and even the King on occasion, by 1337 his discontented villagers even followed him from Cheshire to Rutland‚Äîvery much the other side of the country‚Äîwhich, following a confrontation between the Abbot and his tenants, resulted in the death of a monastic servant and the capture and imprisonment of the Abbot himself. But the King intervened, and the Abbot and his party were soon freed. Abbot Peter's quarrels were not with just his tenantry. He was engaged in a long- running lawsuit with the Abbot of Shrewsbury‚Äîfor which he was summoned to appear before the Archbishop of York, and successfully defended himself‚Äîover Vale Royal's claim to the advowson of Kirkham Church. He was also involved in a feud of some description with the local gentry. This, it seems, was to be fatal. Little is known of this dispute, but, as a result of the feud‚Äîstill attempting to defend his abbey and its rights as he perceived them to be‚Äîin 1340 he was killed during an incursion in which many monastic buildings and goods were burnt. He was succeeded as abbot by Robert de Cheyneston.  Background  Vale Royal Abbey had been founded on its present site by King Edward I in 1277. Although intended to be the biggest and grandest Cistercian church in Christian Europe, building work was very much delayed (Edward had vowed to found the house in 1263, but recurring political crises, his own crusade, and the Second Barons' War prevented any work whatsoever taking place at least until 1270). Work progressed until the 1280s when the abbey's construction was once again delayed by national events, this time Edward's invasion of Wales. The King took not only the money that had been set aside for Vale Royal but also conscripted the masons and other labourers to build his Welsh fortifications. By the 1330s the monks had managed to complete the east end of the church.  Ecclesiastical career  The site of Vale Royal Abbey in 2005. Although cultivated parkland today, in Abbot Peter's day this was within the Forest of Mondrem. Abbot Peter has been described as \\"the most noteworthy of his line.\\" It may well have been he, around 1338, who authored‚Äîor at least began‚Äîthe chronicle known as the Ledger Book. This recorded not only a history of the abbey and its abbots until 1338, but also contained the abbey's litigation records and papal bulla granted to the Cistercians. Abbot Peter was also responsible for re-siting Vale Royal in 1330, which was deemed necessary because the old quarters (which the house had occupied since 1281) had become, says the Ledger, \\"unsightly and ruinous.\\" But the abbey had been so short of funds to carry out its original building works that much of the church and convent buildings were still incomplete. The Abbot reported in 1336 that the vaults, the roof or the windows of the church had yet been finished, and was forced to ask the General Chapter for financial assistance. Around late 1327 or early 1328, Abbot Peter was sued by Shrewsbury Abbey for the sum of 500 marks. This was related to the ongoing dispute over the advowson of Kirkham Church, Lancashire, which had arisen during the abbacy of Peter's predecessor, Walter of Hereford. The advowson had originally belonged to Shrewsbury in the twelfth century, but in 1196 it had been acquired‚Äîthrough litigation‚Äîby Theobald Walter. It had been granted, however, by Edward I to Vale Royal as part of its endowment. Theobald Butler, a descendant of Walter's, continued to press his family's claim to Kirkham. In defence of the abbey's rights to that church, Walter of Hereford had managed not only to get Edward II to confirm his father's grant to the abbey, but also to persuade the pope to confirm it as being in possession for perpetuity. This had been taxed at ¬£160 in the 1270s, but by the time of Peter's abbacy its value had halved to ¬£80. Notwithstanding these confirmations, Abbot Peter was summoned to appear before the Archbishop of York, to demonstrate under what grant or law Vale Royal held Kirkham. He attended the hearing armed with a great deal of written evidence (in the form of charters) and witnesses. The fact that the abbot was forced to publicly defend his rights to his superior may well be a reflection on weaknesses in the wording of the original grant. \\"Even the Abbey's own chronicler,\\" said historian Peter Coss \\"cast some doubt on the justice\\" of the grant. Although Shrewsbury's clam was for eight years' rents from Kirkham church (twelve marks annually), Peter was unable to obtain the dismissal of the suit (or other \\"favourable termination\\"). Although Peter managed to redeem \\"that writ and many others\\" from the Sheriff of Lancashire, Shrewsbury's case was not settled until after Peter's death. In 1337 Abbot Peter became involved in a dispute with Sir William Clifton over the church's tithes from the villages of Clifton and Westby, from which Peter claimed that Sir William had unlawfully taken twenty marks (or, it has been suggested, because the Abbot refused to sell the tithes to Clifton). Peter further accused the knight of taking the money with violence, threatening the rector of Kirkham church and physically preventing him from collecting what was due to the abbey, and sending his retainers to invade the church, stop the service, and hold up a baptism. Sir William also, said Peter, injured the rector's riding horse in what the Abbot described as a \\"ridiculous manner\\". He had also abducted Thomas, one of the Abbot's own clerks, and flagellated him through the streets of Preston. Thanks to the involvement of the Abbot of Westminster, who was the head of the Cistercian Order in England, Clifton was forced to surrender himself to the Abbot in supplication. Abbot Peter received his tithe money and an oath of good behaviour from the errant knight. . = Feud with the villagers of Darnhall = Vale Royal Abbey had been unpopular with the local villagers, as its grants of local land‚Äîsurrounding villagers claimed‚Äîimpinged on their customary liberties. Relations between the abbey and its tenantry had always been tempestuous. In 1275, only a year after the abbey's foundation, tenants of Darnhall attempted to withdraw from paying the Abbot customs and services, a position from which they would not withdraw, but rather pushed with increasing vigour for the next fifty years. Abbot Peter continued his predecessors' campaign to maintain the villeinage of his tenants; or, to put it another way, was \\"an energetic defender of the rights of his house.\\" The tenantry initially relied on the law to obtain satisfaction, but finding Abbot Peter's political connections and influence too powerful, their campaign turned increasingly violent. The tenants of Darnhall, joined by those of surrounding villages, took such umbrage with Abbot Peter's actions that in June 1337 a group of them even followed him across England. The Abbot had visited King Edward III at his King's Cliffe Hunting Lodge. Returning through Rutland, Abbot Peter and his party were accosted by the Cheshiremen (a \\"great crowd of the country people\\" reports the Ledger). The latter attacked, and in the mel√©e that followed, the Abbot was \\"ignominiously taken,\\" and his groom killed. The following day the King ordered the Abbot's release, which was swiftly complied with by his captors, who were themselves then imprisoned. In a curious episode, the King later ordered the Abbot to return to his rebellious tenantry (who by then had been released) the goods Peter had confiscated from them. Less curiously, perhaps, the Abbot refused to do so.  Death  Although details of the exact circumstances of Abbot Peter's death‚Äîand the events leading up to it‚Äîare scarce, he is known to have been involved in a serious dispute with a member of the local gentry, Thomas de Venables. The cause of the dispute was almost certainly Abbot Peter's \\"single-minded defence\\" of his house's rights and prerogatives. Just before he was killed, a number of the Abbot's houses were destroyed, much of his harvest burnt, a quantity of goods stolen and some livestock killed. A fellow monk, Walter le Walche, or Walter Welch, died with him. This is no surprise; Welch had been a loyal associate of the Abbot, and had fought in his defence once before. In the conflict in Rutland three years earlier, when Welch had seen what was afoot, he had raced up from the rear of the party \\"like a champion sent from God\\" to defend the Abbot. Abbot Peter was succeeded as Abbot by one of his monks, Robert de Cheyneston; by 1337, he was a senior official within Abbot Peter's administration.

Rifle Volunteers 1859-1908 It originated in 1859 as the 19th Middlesex Rifle Volunteer Corps, being renumbered the 10th Middlesex Rifle Volunteer Corps in 1880. On the creation of the Volunteer Force in 1881 it was made 1st Volunteer Battalion, Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment). Territorial Force 1908-1945 On the creation of the Territorial Force in 1908, the unit became 1st (City of London) Battalion, London Regiment (Royal Fusiliers). In 1913 Yeomanry House, Bloomsbury was constructed forming the headquarters and drill hall for the battalion. The Battalion was mobilised here in August 1914 and was deployed on railway guarding duties before sailing for Malta and, ultimately, for the Western Front. When the London Regiment disbanded in 1937, the battalion was re-attached to the Royal Fusiliers and renamed 8th (1st City of London) Battalion, The Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment). Post war The battalion remained with the Royal Fusiliers in the initial post-war period, becoming The City of London Battalion, The Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment) in 1961, absorbing 624th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment Royal Artillery (Royal Fusiliers). In the army re-organisation of the late 1960s the four regular fusilier regiments of the British Army merged to form the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers. The City of London was reduced to company-strength and became C Company within the new regiment's 5th (Volunteer) Battalion. In 1988 that battalion was switched to a dual affiliation with the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers and The Queen's Regiment, meaning it was renamed 8th (Volunteer) Battalion The Queen's Fusiliers (City of London), still with a C (City of London) Company. In 1993 a new London Regiment was established. 8th Battalion, Queen's Fusiliers was split up, with A Company and one platoon of C Company merged to form the new regiment's C (City of London Fusiliers) Company, the rest of C Company forming part of the new HQ (Anzio) Company and with B Company becoming the new B (Queen's Regiment) Company.

Despite its primitive appearance, the breeze off Yos Sudarso Bay brought relief from the smells and insects ashore. An officers' club, known within the military as an O club is similar to a gentlemen's club for commissioned officers of the armed forces. Few officers' clubs have survived the end of the Cold War.  Origins  Officers' clubs are an artifact of the feudalism recognizing officers from the aristocratic European landowners as different from the peasants they commanded in military campaigns. Enlisted personnel recruited or inducted into military service remained ineligible for the privileges enjoyed by their officers while commissions awarded to graduates of officer training programs replaced commissions once given by royalty to the sons of their vassals. This social distance was maintained to prevent officers from perceiving their enlisted personnel as friends. Warfare requires expenditure of lives, and officers responsible for ordering enlisted personnel into high-risk situations find it easier to risk lives they don't recognize as friends.  20th-century  Maintaining the separation between officers and enlisted personnel is difficult in the remote places where military bases are built and battles are fought. There are few commercial recreational opportunities, and the financial resources of a few officers cannot match income possibilities these businesses realize from the larger number of enlisted personnel ready to pay for food, drinks, and sexual companionship. So the base facilities would include an officers' club where officers might relax in isolation from their enlisted personnel, and where intoxication might encourage tolerance for deviation from the customary deference of conversations between senior and subordinate officers. Prohibition was a bleak time for officers' clubs in the United States. A bar was the essential element of most officers' clubs. Some served meals as an alternative to the rigid schedule and customs of the mess, and a few clubs on the larger bases hired musical entertainment during their busier hours. Most officers' clubs paid operating expenses from the sale of alcoholic drinks. The most important part of their operating schedule were the happy hours beginning when the base work day ended. The end of Prohibition restored normalcy to US officers' clubs, and was especially important on naval bases because the United States Navy continued to prohibit alcoholic beverages aboard ships. Unlike officers of the other armed services, officers living aboard ship could not drink in their quarters while off-duty. The best days of the officers' clubs began as mobilization for World War II funded construction of bases with officers' clubs sustained for half a century by military staffing levels maintained through the Cold War. These bases often included separate enlisted clubs, but the officers' club was usually built in the location with the best view and air circulation distant from noise, odors, dust or mud, while the preferred social distance often put the enlisted club in a significantly different location. The protected environment of an officers' club offered refuge from public disapproval of the Vietnam War; so drinking at the officers' club became a preferred off-duty social activity for career officers.  Decline  The civil rights movements focused on the perceived inequalities preserving that refuge, and the Tailhook Scandal of 1991 brought public attention to the problem of alcoholism within the military while dissolution of the Soviet Union encouraged reduced military spending. United States military policy changes in response to political criticism included discouraging alcohol consumption and opening the officers' clubs to enlisted personnel. Many officers' clubs closed as they became unable to compete with civilian restaurants after a sharp decline in revenue from alcoholic drink sales.

The most common example is the evolution of a population: the only equilibrium is when there is no one left, but if we model the number of people it is likely to remain stable for a long period of time before it eventually collapses.  Formal definition  We consider a Markov process (Y_t)_{t \\\\geq 0} taking values in \\\\mathcal{X}. There is a measurable set \\\\mathcal{X}^{\\\\mathrm{tr}}of absorbing states and \\\\mathcal{X}^a = \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\setminus \\\\mathcal{X}^{\\\\operatorname{tr}}. We denote by T the hitting time of \\\\mathcal{X}^{\\\\operatorname{tr}}, also called killing time. We denote by \\\\\\\\{ \\\\operatorname{P}_x \\\\mid x \\\\in \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\\\\\} the family of distributions where \\\\operatorname{P}_x has original condition Y_0 = x \\\\in \\\\mathcal{X}. We assume that \\\\mathcal{X}^{\\\\operatorname{tr}} is almost surely reached, i.e. \\\\forall x \\\\in \\\\mathcal{X}, \\\\operatorname{P}_x(T < \\\\infty) = 1. The general definition is: a probability measure u on \\\\mathcal{X}^a is said to be a quasi-stationary distribution (QSD) if for every measurable set B contained in \\\\mathcal{X}^a, \\\\forall t \\\\geq 0, \\\\operatorname{P}_ u(Y_t \\\\in B \\\\mid T > t) = u(B)where \\\\operatorname{P}_ u = \\\\int_{\\\\mathcal{X}^a} \\\\operatorname{P}_x \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} u(x).

General results = Killing time = From the assumptions above we know that the killing time is finite with probability 1. A stronger result than we can derive is that the killing time is exponentially distributed: if u is a QSD then there exists \\\\theta( u) > 0 such that \\\\forall t \\\\in \\\\mathbf{N}, \\\\operatorname{P}_ u(T > t) = \\\\exp(-\\\\theta( u) \\\\times t).

From the previous results we can derive a condition necessary to this existence. Let \\\\theta_x^* := \\\\sup \\\\\\\\{ \\\\theta \\\\mid \\\\operatorname{E}_x(e^{\\\\theta T}) < \\\\infty \\\\\\\\}. A necessary condition for the existence of a QSD is \\\\exists x \\\\in \\\\mathcal{X}^a, \\\\theta_x^* > 0 and we have the equality \\\\theta_x^* = \\\\liminf_{t \\\\to \\\\infty} -\\\\frac{1}{t} \\\\log(\\\\operatorname{P}_x(T > t)). Moreover, from the previous paragraph, if u is a QSD then \\\\operatorname{E}_ u \\\\left( e^{\\\\theta( u)T} \\\\right) = \\\\infty. As a consequence, if \\\\vartheta > 0 satisfies \\\\sup_{x \\\\in \\\\mathcal{X}^a} \\\\\\\\{ \\\\operatorname{E}_x(e^{\\\\vartheta T}) \\\\\\\\} < \\\\infty then there can be no QSD u such that \\\\vartheta = \\\\theta( u) because other wise this would lead to the contradiction \\\\infty = \\\\operatorname{E}_ u \\\\left( e^{\\\\theta( u)T} \\\\right) \\\\leq \\\\sup_{x \\\\in \\\\mathcal{X}^a} \\\\\\\\{ \\\\operatorname{E}_x(e^{\\\\theta( u) T}) \\\\\\\\} < \\\\infty . A sufficient condition for a QSD to exist is given considering the transition semigroup (P_t, t \\\\geq 0) of the process before killing. Then, under the conditions that \\\\mathcal{X}^a is a compact Hausdorff space and that P_1 preserves the set of continuous functions, i.e. P_1(\\\\mathcal{C}(\\\\mathcal{X}^a)) \\\\subseteq \\\\mathcal{C}(\\\\mathcal{X}^a), there exists a QSD.

Shorefast is helping to create a more diverse economy on Fogo Island through a variety of charitable programs and social businesses. Best known among these social businesses is the Fogo Island Inn, which has earned global accolades for exceptional design and place-specific hospitality. All of the furnishings in the Inn are made locally, and after visitors to the Inn expressed interest in purchasing the unique furniture and textile items that decorate the Inn Shorefast founded The Woodshop on Fogo Island, another social business whose surpluses are reinvested in the community.  History  Shorefast was formed in 2006 by siblings Zita, Alan, and Anthony Cobb to build another leg on the Island‚Äôs economy following the collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery. Zita, who grew up on Fogo Island, left the island in 1975 to study business at Carleton University, and went on to become CFO of JDS Fitel, and then senior vice-president of strategy for fiber optics manufacturer JDS Uniphase. Following her career, she returned home to Fogo Island to start Shorefast‚Äôs work with her brothers. Cobb says that ‚Äúthe revitalization of Fogo Island over the past decade builds on the work of people decades before, who gathered to form the Fogo Island Co-operative to rebuild the economy when cod stocks drastically declined.‚Äù Shorefast is recognized as a social enterprise, on the basis that it uses business-minded means to achieve social ends. As the founder, Zita received the Order of Canada in 2016, Canada's highest honour, for the charity's efforts.  Charitable Programs = Fogo Island Arts = Built upon the legacy of the National Film Board of Canada's Fogo Process, Fogo Island Arts is a founding initiative of Shorefast. The residency-based contemporary art venue hosts artists, designers, writers, filmmakers, musicians, curators, and thinkers from around the world. While on the Island, artists work in one of four artist studios designed by Newfoundland-born, Norway-based architect Todd Saunders. Artists-in-residence regularly participate in community engagements, often in the form of public talks, throughout the year and selected artists also present solo exhibitions at the Fogo Island Gallery, located in the Fogo Island Inn. = New Ocean Ethic = New Ocean Ethic is a series of initiatives organized to support our oceans. Led by Gordon Slade, , this program \\"helps to remind us that if we are to continue to benefit from our relationships with the sea, we must rethink the way we use its resources and exist responsibly on its shores\\". The program works with researchers, academics, practitioners, universities, organizations, communities and other stakeholders to build ocean health. = Geology at the Edge = Geology at the Edge is Canada's first community-based geologist-in- residence program. This program \\"aims to combine the understanding or geological heritage with sustainable economic development focused upon geotourism, tourism that creates conditions for the socio-economic well-being of communities while maintaining their cultural and ecological integrity\\" = Boatbuilding = Small wooden boats known as punts, and the skills required to make them, have been an essential part of the social and economic fabric of rural Newfoundland. Committed to ensuring the survival of this heritage Shorefast opened the Punt Premises in June 2019 in the community of Joe Batt‚Äôs Arm, Fogo Island. The premises is a set of restored heritage buildings that serves as an interactive cultural interpretation center that encourages visitor interaction with the historical and cultural assets of the inshore fishery. Consisting of restored heritage buildings, the site serves as a community gathering space, boatbuilding education centre and offers punts for people to row in the harbour. = Academic Residencies = In partnership with Memorial University of Newfoundland, in 2016 the Academics-in-Residence program was created. The program consists of a yearly group of academic fellows who visit Fogo Island to perform research, interact with the community, and share their areas of expertise. = Microlending = Known as the Shorefast Business Assistance Fund, Shorefast provides micro-loans on friendly terms to those seeking to start a business on Fogo Island. The fund has granted loans to a diverse set of successful businesses on the Island and continues to accept applications = Vernacular Architecture = A reflection of the needs of early settlers, many early structures built in Newfoundland were constructed of wood rather than stone and close to the shore to allow easy access to fishing grounds. Fogo Island‚Äôs contribution to this vernacular architecture still exists to this day. Shorefast invests in ‚Äúrestoring a number of heritage homes, churches, and public buildings in order to preserve Fogo Island‚Äôs distinct built heritage and give these structures continued relevance through continued use\\". = Geotourism = Geotourism sustains or enhances the distinctive geographical character of a place including its environment, heritage, aesthetics, culture, and the well-being of its residents. Shorefast is committed to upholding the tenets of geotourism such that the best interests of Fogo Island‚Äôs natural environment, cultural legacy, people, and communities serve as the most important guideposts. The Fogo Island Inn stands as Shorefast‚Äôs major geotourism project on Fogo Island = Economic Development Partnership = A joint partnership between Shorefast, the Town of Fogo Island and the Fogo Island Co-operative Society Limited, the Economic Development Partnership unites public and private on-Island leadership to encourage and facilitate economic development on Fogo Island. The partnership endeavors to create jobs, encourage youth ventures, and foster a unified economic vision for Fogo Island through the start-up and expansion of small and medium-sized businesses that complement the natural, cultural and other place-based assets of Fogo Island.  Social Businesses = Fogo Island Inn = Utilizing the principles of asset-based community development Shorefast opened the Fogo Island Inn in 2013 as a way to express traditional knowledge and hospitality in new ways and to serve as an economic engine for Fogo Island. Designed by Newfoundland-born, Norway-based architect Todd Saunders, the Inn features 29 one-of-a-kind rooms and draws from the vernacular architecture found on the island. The furniture and textiles that decorate the Inn are handcrafted and primarily produced on Fogo Island. A result of the unique collaboration between international designers and the skilled artisans and craftspeople of Fogo Island. The Inn was built with philanthropic funds and all surplus profits are returned to Shorefast for reinvestment into the community. As such, there are no investors seeking a return, and no private gain. This model means that the community of Fogo Island is the beneficial owner of the Inn. = The Woodshop on Fogo Island = By virtue of their geographic isolation, Fogo Islanders have become masters of making things by hand. Since they arrived as settlers in the late 1600s, Fogo Islanders have been building wooden boats, houses, tools and furniture and creating textiles in the form of knitting, quilting, rug hooking and more. Housed in the renovated Society of United Fishermen‚Äôs Hall in the community of Barr‚Äôd Islands on Fogo Island, The Woodshop on Fogo Island is the result of an innovative collaborative process between international designers and the artisans and craftspeople of Fogo Island. Furniture and textile pieces were created by this partnership for the Fogo Island Inn, but due to the popularity of the pieces among guests a brick and mortar shop was opened. The Woodshop employs staff year round, including woodworkers who cut, nail, glue, sand, finish and paint every item by hand. As a Shorefast social business, all items are priced to create a surplus, which is then reinvested back into the community. = Fogo Island Fish = Sustained on primarily cod fishing for generations, fishing is tied to family life, culture and economy in Newfoundland and Labrador. During the mid-twentieth century, with the introduction of international factory-scale overfishing, cod populations fell drastically forcing the province to announce a cod moratorium in 1992, resulting in an estimated 30,000 job losses and a way of life. In recent years the inshore cod stocks have been rising, allowing people to once again begin to catch small quotas of fish. Fogo Island Fish employs Fogo Islanders to catch cod using the traditional hand-line caught method, one at a time, resulting in zero by-catch. All caught within a five mile radius of the coast of Fogo Island, this close proximity allows fish to be processed within hours of being caught resulting in a superior product that has been lauded by the restaurant industry. Primarily supplying high-end restaurants in Ontario, Fogo Island Fish is able to pay their fishers well above market rates and surpluses are reinvested back into the community. Fogo Island Fish was the subject of the National Film Board short-documentary HAND.LINE.COD. directed by Justin Simms, that premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2016.  Cauliflower Thinking  Economic Nutrition Label  In 2017, Shorefast launched its Economic Nutrition Label. The labels, available for most of The Woodshop on Fogo Island‚Äôs retail items, as well as for the cost of a stay at Fogo Island Inn, show ‚Äúwhere the money goes‚Äù when consumers make purchases at Shorefast's social businesses. As a play on the classic nutrition fact labels legally required on food products in most countries, the Economic Nutrition Label shows how much of the purchase price of any particular item goes towards production processes including labour, materials, or operations, as well as the money‚Äôs geographical destination. The labels \\"are intended to bring transparency to where the money from your purchase goes ‚Äì how it will be invested in the local community and how it impacts the broader economy.\\"  References  Charities based in Canada Canadian companies established in 2006 ","title":"Shorefast"},{"id":"56532512","text":"Dmitry Stanislavovich Belosselskiy (–î–º–∏—Ç—Ä–∏–π –°—Ç–∞–Ω–∏—Å–ª–∞–≤–æ–≤–∏—á –ë–µ–ª–æ—Å–µ–ª—å—Å–∫–∏–π) is a Russian operatic bass singer who made an international career.

It was founded on 2 February 1918, as a permanent consolidation of four established jagdstaffeln (fighter squadrons)‚Äî2, 26, 27, and 36. JG III was formed as a follow-on of Manfred von Richthofen's highly successful Jagdgeschwader I. With a nominal strength of 56 aircraft, JG III would be under direct orders of an Armee headquarters. The German General Staff was planning a Spring Offensive to begin on 21 March 1918, and wanted to assign a fighter wing to each of the three Armees involved in the assault.Jagdgeschwader II was founded the same day from Jastas 12, 13, 15, and 19. An experienced flying ace with 22 victories, Oberleutnant Bruno Loerzer, was appointed to command JG III. On 12 to 15 March 1918, JG III's aircraft would be hidden near the front lines awaiting the Spring Offensive. On 21 March, the wing cleared the sky of opposing aircraft, to begin their support of Operation Michael. Subsequent to this, the wing would fight in the Battle of the Lys, the Third Battle of the Aisne, and the Second Battle of the Marne offensives. When the Allied Hundred Days Offensive began on 8 August, JG III was still in the fight. Despite increasing shortages of supplies, aircraft, and pilots, along with frequent changes of airfields during withdrawals, the wing had its most successful month of the war in September. On 2 September, JG III shot down 26 enemy aircraft, for the best day's performance of any German wing in World War I. However, by October, the Allied air forces‚Äîwhich now included fresh American units‚Äîwere numerous enough to overwhelm German defenses. Jagdgeschwader III flew its final combat missions on 4 November 1918. Incomplete records make the wing's wartime victory total uncertain, but it is conservatively estimated as a minimum of 370 French, British, and American aircraft shot down.  Operational history = Foundation = Jagdgeschwader III (JG III) was founded on 2 February 1918. It comprised four Jagdstaffeln (fighter squadrons) with a nominal strength of 14 aircraft each. This fighter wing would fly under direction of an Army Headquarters. The success of such a massing of fighter aircraft power had already been proven by the success of Jagdgeschwader I (JG I), founded 23 June the previous year. German strategy now called for a fighter wing per army to support each of three attacking armies. Jagdgeschwader II (JG II) and Jagdgeschwader III were slated to be combat ready in time to join JG I in the Spring Offensive planned for 21 March 1918. JG III would consist of four existing seasoned Jagdstaffeln‚Äî2, 26, 27, and 36. Oberleutnant Bruno Loerzer was selected for command of JG III. Bruno Loerzer and his Albatros D.V From 12 to 15 March 1918, the four squadrons of the new wing moved forward to support 17th Armee when the attack began. Nine additional jastas had also been moved there. Hangar tents were not erected for airplanes; the machines were hidden in farm buildings to prevent observation by enemy reconnaissance craft. Flying was kept to a bare minimum, as JG III husbanded its resources while awaiting the upcoming offensive. = Operation Michael = Fog and low clouds prevented flying until about noon on 21 March, after which the wing established air superiority over the British positions. The next day, JG III tangled with British pilots of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) over Cambrai, claiming two victories and sustaining a casualty. On 23 March, the RFC concentrated on attacking the German army cooperation two-seaters near Bapaume. In turn, the German fighter pilots assailed the British. JG III was credited with nine victories that day; however, British aircraft managed for the first time to strafe the advancing German troops. The RFC reinforced its numbers on 24 and 25 March. The morning of 26 March saw the greatest British force yet, with formations as numerous as 60 planes. The confused, ferocious air combats continued over the next two days. Then the German advance stalled. Air activity dwindled. = Battle of the Lys = The German high command began a further offense on 12 April. JG III was shifted to support the 4th Armee for an attack on Kemmel Ridge. Ten additional jadgstaffeln were placed under Loerzer's command. The 14 squadrons were committed to a front only 15 kilometers wide, and penetrated deep into British-held territory. On 25 April, three German divisions stormed the hill. Overhead, about 100 German aircraft flew unopposed. German ground support planes strafed the British while JG III flew top cover. A Fokker D.VII in factory finish This latest offensive petered out by the end of April. The pilots of JG III anxiously awaited new Fokker D.VII fighters. Their old Albatros fighters were worn out; the new Triplanes were too slow, and needed scarce castor oil for a reliable rotary engine lubricant. When a few of the new aircraft arrived, they were parceled out, with three squadrons each receiving some. Jagdstaffel 26 kept its triplanes, but other spare Fokker Dr.Is were returned to the rear. By 24 May 1918, JG III had moved to support the upcoming German offensive against the Chemin des Dames. The German high command wanted to defeat the Allies before American troops could enter the war. For the first time, French fliers would oppose the Germans. = Third Battle of the Aisne = The next offensive was launched by the Germans on 27 May. Surging forward under air cover, the German infantry gained 21 kilometers to capture bridges crossing the Marne River. However, by 3 June 1918, the exhausted German troops ran down. With heavy casualties, insufficient supplies and few reinforcements, the attack stalled. The Fokker Dr.I triplanes of Jasta 26 waiting on their flightline Now three of JG III's squadrons were re-equipped with Fokker D.VIIs. Jagdstaffel 36 remained stocked with Fokker Dr.I triplanes. The wing now partnered with JG I on 9 June 1918, for the latest segment of the German Spring Offensive. JG III covered the 18th Armee's flank. Fighting continued through the month. By the 28th, a new foe had appeared to oppose JG III‚Äîthe American First Pursuit Group. = Second Battle of the Marne = On 15 July 1918, the Germans launched another offensive. JG III supported 7th Armee, and in turn was supported by JG I. As 7th Armee was the first to attack, it saw heavy fighting. JG III was now equipped with Fokker D.VIIs equipped with parachutes, but it faced opposition from an array of French, American, and British squadrons. Despite excessive heat and rainy weather, air activity over the battlefield was brisk. An armada of 225 French bombers struck German pontoon bridges crossing the Marne River, dropping 40 tons of bombs. By nightfall, JG III had downed seven enemy planes. The following day was hotter still. There was a very real danger that phosphorus ammunition aboard any German aircraft could ignite from the extreme temperatures; seven German airplanes supporting 7th Armee were lost to self- ignition of ammunition during 15 and 16 July. On 17 July, German progress on the ground stalled with the arrival of the British XXII Corps and 85,000 American as reinforcements for the French. Heavy rain and fog restricted air activity. The following day saw a French counterattack. Over the next few days, JG III had to move to the rear as the French assault gained ground. When foul weather grounded the wing on 26 and 27 July, the unit had been displaced three times. By the beginning of August, the air offensive had fizzled out in a week-long rain that prevented flight. = Tide of battle turns = On 8 August 1918, the British 4th Army and the French 1st Army surged into an attack launched on the heels of a heavy artillery bombardment. The assault included a large force of tanks and a huge air effort by the Royal Air Force. The German 2nd Armee, located northwest of JG III, bore the brunt of the blow. The wing fought intensely for three days, racking up nine victories. On 12 August, JG III was held patrolling behind their own lines in anticipation of another Allied attack near Fismes. The next two days were spent flying in the van of the German attack; there was no concerted Allied air opposition. = Battle of Bapaume = The next stage of the Allied Hundred Days Offensive came on 21 August 1918. The British Third Army attacked, supported by 100 tanks and newly committed American air power. Pilots from JG III dove on four 148th Aero Squadron Sopwith Camels on a ground attack mission on 26 August. Nine Camels of the 17th Aero Squadron came to the aid of their fellow Americans. In the ensuing dogfight, seven Americans were downed for no German loss. Six of the casualties came from the 17th Aero Squadron. The American 148th Aero Squadron pilots stand by their Sopwith Camels. In the final six days of August, Jagdgeschwader III scored 23 victories. On 2 September, they bettered that in a single day. The wing scored 26 of the 35 German aerial victories on 2 September. The 148th Aero Squadron took the brunt of the action; out of B Flight's five pilots, only one returned home. By the last mission of the day, there was no aerial opposition to the wing; JG III turned to strafing enemy troops. JG III had had the most successful day of any German wing in World War I. On 3 September, the German wing downed 10 more enemy planes; on the next day, 15 more. The wing would continue to wage its successful campaign, although by 17 September Jagdstaffel 36 had only a single airplane. On 18 September, a headquarters summary from the 17th Armee noted that JG III had destroyed 250 enemy aircraft in 202 days of fighting. On 24 September, Jagdstaffel 36 received an infusion of Fokker D.VIIs; however, the squadron would not score another victory until 4 October. Jagdgeschwader III continued to fight through the end of September, but several factors began to degrade its combat capabilities. There were frequent airfield changes due to the retreat of German ground forces. Fuel for the airplanes began to be rationed. A trio of JG III's most prolific aces dropped from the wing's ranks in late September‚ÄîRudolf Klimke, Otto Fruhner, and Friedrich Noltenius. Records for October 1918's wing operations are scarce. However, those existing depict a diminished wing constantly on the move and curtailed by supply shortages. They were faced with overwhelming numbers of Allied fighters. Mid-month, Bruno Loerzer, lately promoted to Hauptmann, took Paul Baumer with him to the new fighter testing at Adlershof, Germany. That removed two more high scoring aces from the ranks of JG III. From 14 to 25 October, JG III scored no victories. Nevertheless, on the war's heaviest day of aerial combat, 30 October, the wing still shot down 10 enemy aircraft. = End = On 4 November 1918, all four jadgstaffeln of Jagdgeschwader III flew into combat, scoring victories against Bristol F.2b and Sopwith Snipe fighters and an Airco DH.9 bomber. These 13 victories would be the last by JG III. The Armistice of 11 November 1918 would end the war. The wing's pilots remained defiant to the end. Before surrendering their Fokker D.VIIs to the Allies, Jagdstaffel 2 pilots wrote their names and the number of their aerial victories on the aircraft fuselages. Incomplete records preclude an exact count of Jagdgeschwader III victories. However, they are estimated at a minimum of 370 enemy aircraft destroyed during the wing's nine months of existence.

In 2009, an investigation by the Samoan Observer newspaper identified that prostitution was taking place on the islands. A study carried out in 2016 by the United Nations Development Programme, UNICEF and the University of New South Wales indicated that there were approximately 400 female sex workers in Samoa, serving local and foreign clients. This equates to 1 in every 140 of the adult women on the island. The primary reason for women doing sex work was economic; some starting sex work as early as 13 years old. In February 2017, Samoa Police prepared to launch an investigation into a foreign-owned business alleged to be using local women in a prostitution operation. In the same year the Ministry of Health put forward plans to offer counselling and educational services to sex workers as part of the National HIV, AIDS, and STI Policy 2017-2022. Legal situation Prostitution is illegal in Samoa under the Crimes Act 2013. Samoan law also prohibits anyone from living on the earnings of a prostitute, for which the maximum penalty is ten years' imprisonment. Procuring and brothelkeeping are also illegal, with the latter subject to a maximum of ten years' imprisonment. =Legislation= The provisions of the Crimes Act 2013 in relation to prostitution are: * Article 62. Using threats of intimidation for the purpose of sexual conduct - Maximum penalty 5 years imprisonment * Article 70. Brothel keeping - Maximum 10 years * Article 72. Prostitution - Maximum 3 years * Article 73. Solicitation - Maximum 5 years * Article 74. Living on earnings of prostitution - Maximum 10 years * Article 75. Procuring sexual intercourse - Maximum 7 years History In the 19thc, the fishing village of Apia grew into a port in which ships of many nations stopped. Prostitution grew in the harbour area to such an extent that in 1892, Robert Louis Stevenson wrote \\"the white people of Apia lay in the worst squalor of degradation\\". The town was also known as ‚Äúlittle Cairo‚Äù and ‚Äúhell in the Pacific‚Äù. Many of the prostitutes were \\"half-caste\\". In 1893, the Reverend John William Hill proposed building a hospital for diseased prostitutes. During the Second World War, the number of American troops on the island caused a large spike in prostitution. The entrance gates at the airport were known by Samoans as ‚Äúthe gates of sin.\\" One matai (chief) was expelled from his village for suspicion of procuring prostitutes for the Americans.

History  Since there were many tunnels on the Rhodope Railway, there was naturally also a great deal of annoyance on the part of the staff and passengers traveling uphill through the exhaust fumes of the locomotives. Therefore, the BD≈Ω decided already in the year of the opening in 1939 to procure diesel railcars for comfort improvement. 1941 followed then the delivery of three motor coaches and three additional trailers with a seat capacity of 62 seats. Seven similar railcars had been delivered in 1938 to the Yugoslav Railways for the local narrow gauge network as a series 801. The railcars were used only on the Rhodope Railway. In 1952, four more railcars of BD≈Ω class 05 04-07 were ordered with increased power. Earliest timetables for the vehicles are known only from the year 1969, where the first railcar now designated as 81-01 covered the connection between Varvara and Pazardzhik six times daily.Paul Engelbert: Schmalspurig durch Bulgarien, Stenvalls Verlag, Malm√∂ 2002, , page 71 Much earlier, in 1963, the railcar 81-03 had already been retired.Paul Engelbert: Schmalspurig durch Bulgarien, Stenvalls Verlag, Malm√∂ 2002, , page 93 After the appearance of the new class 75, the vehicles were not resettled together with the class 82 to Cherven Bryag, but they remained in Septemvri. The withdrawal took place in 1973 (81-01) and 1975 (81-02). Another sign of life is not to be found for the vehicles. They were stationed until their cancellation in Septemvri, the subject of the photo created in 2015 could come from the pre-war production.Photo of the wreck of a trailer of a Ganz railcar in Septemvri At their delivery, the vehicles had a very modern silver-gray paint. Later, some vehicles were painted blue in the lower half and white in the upper half. Whether vehicles of this series, is not known, all known photos with vehicles of the series 81 have a silver-gray paint.  Technical features  Interior view of the railcar class 05 on a factory photo of Ganz Works The vehicles were optimally designed for the conditions of the Rhodopebahn as mountain railcars with the highest friction weight (identical to the service mass). For narrow-gauge conditions they were designed quite large, much larger than the known narrow-gauge railcars DR 137 322 to 325, which they still towered by three meters in length. But they had about the same number of seats as this series. In one end of the steel skeleton construction of the car body were placed the seats in wood lath construction and in the other end the machinery. Where the diesel engine was located, there was a luggage and payload compartment. The cargo compartment was closed with a central folding door, the entrances for the passengers were via the doors close to the end of the railcar. The entry spaces were the workplaces for the engine driver, on the end not used the controls could be closed by roller blinds.Draft with photos of railcar class 82 The trailers were similarly designed, they lacked the payload compartments and the center doors. But they had a significantly higher capacity with 62 seats. About the machinery it is known that the engine was Ganz VI IaT 170/240 that produced and the power transmission was mechanical. The engine gave its torque to the four-speed transmission lying exactly in the middle of the car, both bogie wheels were driven by Cardan shafts. This arrangement gave the railcar an extraordinarily high frictional weight, enabling it to handle any situation on the mountain railway.

The local hardcore scene drew from Philadelphia as well as Delaware County, Pennsylvania; South Jersey, Reading, Allentown, Delaware, and other surrounding suburbs in the Philadelphia metropolitan area or Delaware Valley, as well as the Lehigh Valley. An important source of exposing the Philadelphia region to this music were the DJs Jeff Jenkins and Steve Lukshides at WKDU, 91.7 FM, Drexel University's radio station and Eddie \\"Hacksaw\\" at University of Pennsylvania's WXPN, 88.5 FM.

Elsewhere, Cappadocians are primarily known for their military issues of coins, and the less monetized Pontic region primarily struck bronze coinage. The purpose of the first royal Bithynian and Cappadocian bronze coinage is still unknown. History The first king was Zipoetes I c. 298 BC ‚Äì c. 279 BC. It is thought that there were no coinage struck during his reign. The first Bithynian king to strike coins was Nicomedes I (c. 280 BC ‚Äì c. 250 BC). He is primarily known for bringing the Gauls known as Galatians to the Asia Minor in 277 BC to fight against his brother and Antiochus I. This short-sighted mistake brought troubles for local Greeks for a century. In early 260s BC, possibly in 264 BC according to Eusebius, he moved the capital to Nicomedia on the Propontis. There was a mint in the new capital. Silver tetradrachms and drachms of the Attic weight are known. Nicomedes I is known to have struck some bronze coinage too. Both Bithynian and Cappadocian coinages were started with minor series of bronze coins. Successor of Nicomedes I was Ziaelas (c. 250 BC ‚Äì 230 BC). He is known for having minted bronze coinage. However, only a few specimen have survived. Reign of Prusias I (c. 232 BC ‚Äì 182 BC) saw birth of a more regular silver and bronze coinage for the kingdom. The first large issues of coins can be thus attributed to him. Bronze coinage of Prusias I and Prusias II have not been differentiated in the most common catalogues. However, those related to Ziaelas can be attributed to Prusias I. Nicomedes II is notable for having struck the first gold staters in the kingdom's history. Those coins had his portrait on their obverse, and a galloping horseman on the reverse. He also introduced the year number of the Bithynian era on his coins, replacing the Seleucid era.Jakob Munk H√∏jte, \\"From Kingdom to Province: Reshaping Pontos after the Fall of Mithridates VI\\", in T√∏nnes Bekker-Nielsen (ed.), Rome and the Black Sea Region: Domination, Romanisation, Resistance (Aarhus University Press, 2006), 15‚Äì30. Both Nicomedes III and Nicomedes IV struck similar tetradrachms as their predecessor Nicomedes II. End of the kingdom Roman provincial coin of Antoninus Pius On the death of king Nicomedes IV in 74 BC the kingdom was bequeathed to the Roman Empire, and subsequently reconstituted as a Roman province. It was later part of the province of the Bithynia and Pontus. Roman administration saw introduction of a new provincial currency, and Bithynian polity's capital was moved back to Nicomedia. During Roman rule the provincial cities that, in the combined province of Bithynia and Pontus, issued coinage reached 29 cities during the second century AD. Some of these cities on the Bithynian region included Apamea Myrlea, Bithynium, Nicaea, Nicomedia and Tium.

Description and history South Dakota Department of Transportation Bridge No. 63-198-181 was located about south of Davis, carrying 460th Avenue over the East Fork Vermillion River just north of 286th Street. It was a three-span structure, with timber-framed approach spans on either side of a central Pratt through truss. The main span was , and rested on concrete piers, while the outermost supports were concrete abutments with flared wing walls. The truss elements were riveted together, and the bridge's deck support consisted of two layers of wooden planking set on timber beams laid over steel I-beams, which were riveted to hangar plates on the trusses. The bridge was built in 1909 by the Iowa Bridge Company of Des Moines, Iowa. The county had a contract with that company to provide its steel truss bridges between 1905 and 1911, apparently as part of a common but illegal practice of \\"pooling\\", in which companies divided the state into areas where they did not compete against one another.

Context  The first railway station in Ulster was opened on the site of today's Great Victoria Street station in 1839. It became the northern terminus of the GNR's non-stop Dublin - Belfast express in 1947, and in 1962, having been taken over by the Ulster Transport Authority, platform 5 was closed, filled in, and turned into a bus station providing a truly integrated bus-rail station for the first time in Belfast's history. Northern Ireland Railways closed the railway part of the station altogether in 1976 and the original buildings disappeared beneath the Europa Hotel and Great Northern Mall. Railway services resumed, however, in 1995 with the opening of the present-day Great Victoria Street station, integrated with the Europa Buscentre, yards away from the site of the original 1839 station. The Transport Hub will not be on strictly the same site as today's Great Victoria Street station, instead being in the corner of Grosvenor Road and Durham Street. Historically this area was occupied by the railway goods yard, until goods traffic ended in 1976, and at present is partly used as the bus depot. The Transport Hub thus fits into a history of bus-rail integration linked to the Great Victoria Street area that goes back to 1962, save for a 19-year interruption between 1976 and 1995.

File:Goldliners at the Europa Bus Station, Belfast - geograph.org.uk - 2908798.jpgThe present-day Europa Buscentre.  Proposal = Railway Station = The new station would have eight platforms (Double that of Great Victoria Street) under a large overall roof, composed of four island platforms with two faces each. Two of these islands would be short, covered entirely by the roof, and two long. Like the current Great Victoria Street, it will be the terminus of NIR's Derry, Larne, Bangor and Newry lines. The Enterprise will be moved from Lanyon Place as part of the Hub project, meaning the flagship express service between Belfast and Dublin will terminate here. Unlike at Lanyon Place, there will be a dedicated Enterprise lounge. = Bus Station = Like the present Europa Buscentre, the Transport Hub will have stands for Ulsterbus, Goldline and Metro buses. However, the number of stands will be increased from Europa's 18 to 26. There will be a dedicated lounge for Goldliner passengers. = Weaver's Cross = The area surrounding the hub will become a new neighbourhood which Translink has named Weaver's Cross. This 100,000m2 site will comprise leisure, residential and commercial facilities. = Station Quarter = Weaver's Cross combined with the Hub and a rejuvenated Glengall Street, Hope Street and Durham Street will become Station Quarter, Belfast's ninth Cultural Quarter.  Progress  As of February 2018, progress has mostly consisted of public consultation and minor preparatory work. In April 2016 the goods sheds in the former Grosvenor Yard were demolished to make way for the Hub. Stanchions and support beams from the goods sheds were donated by Translink to the Downpatrick and County Down Railway.  Controversies  Though the project is still in its early days a few issues have arisen, including: * The demolition of the Boyne Bridge, which has particularly upset the residents of Sandy Row * The lack of integration with the new Glider rapid transport system, criticised as a missed opportunity for a transport hub References Proposed buildings and structures in Northern Ireland ","title":"Belfast Transport Hub"},{"id":"56533533","text":"David Wylie McDonald, (9 October 1927 ‚Äì 8 March 2007) was a Scottish architect and a colonial civil servant. He was the Director of Public Works in Hong Kong and the first Secretary for Lands and Works. Biography Born on 9 October 1927 in Armadale, West Lothian, he was educated at Harris Academy, Dundee and volunteered for the Black Watch at the age of 17 in late 1944. One of his first postings was to guard the Princess Elizabeth at Balmoral where he served as a dancing partner and also part of the King's Guard in Inverness and Edinburgh. He took his architecture degree at Dundee College of Art and obtained a trainee job with a local architectural firm and married Eliza (Betty) Roberts Steele on 3 July 1951. He moved to Hong Kong in 1955 and joined the colonial government. He quickly learned Cantonese and was able to communicate with the locals. He became the Director of Public Works in 1974 and the first Secretary for Lands and Works in 1981 when the post was created by Governor Murray MacLehose. He was responsible for the construction of the new towns in the New Territories, the High Island Reservoir scheme to provide drinking water and pushed through the coastal highway link between Sha Tin and Tai Po, and the Aberdeen Tunnel linking Wong Chuk Hang and Happy Valley. He was also in charge of the HK$3.5 billion scheme to modernise and electrify the Kowloon-Canton Railway and construction of the 1,400-bed Prince of Wales Hospital. McDonald also streamlined the over-bureaucratic Public Works department and set up a unit to eliminate bribery and corruption. McDonald was also a coach of the Hong Kong's swimming team at the 1974 Commonwealth Games in Christchurch, New Zealand. He was also an active member and the chieftain of the St. Andrew's Society of Hong Kong. After his retirement in 1983, McDonald returned to Dundee with his wife. In Dundee, he was on the board of the Edinburgh-based Margaret Blackwood Housing Association which provides a home for disabled people and their families. He later moved to Perth, Australia with his wife to be close to their two daughters. He died there on 8 March 2007, aged 79.

The Lo Curro house At the beginning of the period of the Military Regime, an electronic and chemical warfare laboratory was installed in the house of Michael Townley and Mariana Callejas in , located at Via Naranja 4925, Vitacura, Chile. The government of Augusto Pinochet had given them that house ‚Äì three floors, almost 1,000 square meters of building and 5,000 of land ‚Äì located in the upper part of Santiago, in return for services rendered to the Direcci√≥n de Inteligencia Nacional (DINA). Legally it was not theirs, as it had been acquired by then Army Major Ra√∫l Iturriaga and a DINA lawyer who died in strange circumstances in 1976 under a false identity. The idea was for it to serve as housing for the married agents and their children, but mainly ‚Äì because it was not an unconditional gift ‚Äì for the barracks to operate there, from which subsequent terrorist operations abroad would be prepared. In the DINA this barracks house was called Quetropill√°n. It had two permanent agents, who served as drivers and assistants, and a secretary, who kept the accounts and assisted the homeowner in administrative tasks. In addition, the team included a gardener, a cook, and two chemists: Francisco Oyarz√∫n and Eugenio Berr√≠os, alias Hermes. The latter two spent the day locked in a laboratory, experimenting with the lethality of sarin gas on mice and rabbits. Victims The sarin gas was first manufactured by the DINA in Santiago, and then began to be made in Colonia Dignidad, with its logistical support. It was exported and used to assassinate opponents of the regime both in Chile and abroad. The victims presented the symptoms of a heart attack. =First tests= Sarin manufactured in Chile was used for the first time by Michael Townley against two Peruvian citizens. Townley revealed to Judge Alejandro Madrid that in Chile not only real estate conservator Renato Le√≥n Zenteno (1976) and Army corporal and DINA agent Manuel Leyton (1977) were murdered with sarin, but also other people whose deaths were made to appear as suicides or strange deaths. Some of these people, according to Townley, were involved in the storage and transport of containers of sarin in the 1970s and early 1980s. One of them would be a doctor or assistant who participated in the autopsies of Renato Zenteno and Corporal Leyton. =Carlos Osorio= Townley told the judge that the Protocol Director of the Chilean Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Carlos Guillermo Osorio, had not committed suicide ‚Äì as was officially announced in October 1977 ‚Äì but had been killed. Osorio was in charge of granting passports with false identities so that Army officers ‚Äì among them, Armando Fern√°ndez Larios ‚Äì could travel to the United States to prepare the attack against Orlando Letelier and two others (Rolando Mosqueira and Ren√© Riveros), to try to mislead American intelligence about the authorship of the attack and cover the backs of the DINA. The sources maintain that Townley affirmed that Osorio was another victim of sarin, even though he had been shot once in the head. =Carmelo Soria= Eugenio Berr√≠os played a role in the death of Carmelo Soria, a CEPAL official who was kidnapped by a DINA operative in July 1976 and taken to Townley's house in Lo Curro. There, in the Berr√≠os laboratory, Soria was administered sarin gas, according to the investigation, and was then tortured until his spine was broken. Later, his body was found in a car in the . This gas was probably used to murder the journalist , who in June 1975 was found dead in circumstances not entirely clear, in the room he occupied in Paris, where he worked at the newspaper L'Humanit√©. In 1990, the journalist Edwin Harrington published in the magazine Nueva Voz that Lira was murdered by the DINA as part of a plan called Operation France after the arrival in the French capital of \\"Bernardo Conrads Salazar, identity card No. 4.152.556-6, official of the security service of the dictatorship.\\" Harrington, who cited an FBI report as one of his main sources, argued that Lira's death may have been triggered by sarin gas, which Townley carried on his travels in a bottle of Chanel perfume. Another suspicious death was that of Alfred Schaak, a representative of Paul Sch√§fer in Germany in charge of arms trafficking. In 1985, two couples who fled from Colonia Dignidad publicly denounced Sch√§fer's pedophilia. It seems that Schaak then wanted to denounce the arms trade. To prevent this, Winfried Schmidtke and Helmut Seelbach, who were received at the airport by Schaak, who was in perfect health, would have traveled from Dignidad to Germany. A few days later, in October, Schaak died suddenly. Dr. Hartmut Hopp went immediately to Germany and brought the body of Schaak to Chile. In the assembly of settlers he said that Schaak had died of fever and that in his will he left his property to the Colony. At the same time they reported ‚Äì ten months after the fact ‚Äì the escape of the couples, adding that their complaints in Germany had done them great harm. The subsequent condemnation of Sch√§fer does not include sarin gas production in Colonia Dignidad, the , nor the Monte Maravilla forced labor camp that the colony maintained, since Judge Jorge Zepeda Arancibia did not include these charges in the ruling that sentenced him to a minimum term of seven years of imprisonment for infraction of the Law on Arms Control. =Sim√≥n Bol√≠var de La Reina barracks= Alexei Jaccard, age 25, was arrested in Buenos Aires on 16 May 1977, along with two other communist militants, by agents of the Argentine dictatorship and the DINA. At that time all traces of them were lost. Despite the efforts made by his family to learn his whereabouts, both in Argentina and in Chile, they only turned up false leads. This changed when three agents, who did not lose their memory or declare themselves insane as their former boss Augusto Pinochet had, gave the judiciary unequivocal information about what happened with Jaccard and the two militants, Ricardo Ram√≠rez Herrera and H√©ctor Vel√°squez Mardones. The testimonies coincide in that the three detainees, from Buenos Aires, were taken to the La Reina barracks by \\"Don Jaime\\" (alias of Captain Germ√°n Barriga, who committed suicide in 2005) and his agents of Dolphin Group, an elite squad that operated inside the . The director of the DINA, Manuel Contreras, always stated in private and in public that Jaccard, Herrera, and Vel√°squez were arrested by Argentine intelligence, which had made them disappear by throwing their bodies into the R√≠o de la Plata. But the former agents Eduardo Oyarce Riquelme, H√©ctor Valdebenito Araya, and Guillermo Ferr√°n Mart√≠nez, all prosecuted for the crimes committed in Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, deny that version, and confirm the passage of Jaccard and his companions through that barracks. Former agent Oyarce recalls another relevant piece of information: Judicial aspects On 23 July 2007, Judge Alejandro Madrid undertook \\"two resolutions that mark milestones in the trials for human rights violations\\" and that are related to the Andrea Project: \\"He affirmed that the murder of the ex-Army corporal Manuel Leyton was carried out using sarin gas, and prosecuted thirteen former DINA agents for this crime. He proceeded to prosecute the former Army auditor, Fernando Torres Silva, for conspiracy in the case of the murder with the chemical that produced the poisonous element in the security services, Eugenio Berr√≠os.\\" FBI investigation The FBI has evidence confirming that Augusto Pinochet accumulated large amounts of poison gas, according to Saul Landau, the US investigator for the Orlando Letelier murder. The FBI investigated the sarin, and its conclusions were condensed in a report indicating that it was manufactured in an amount sufficient to kill the entire Peruvian Army twice over. Book La danza de los cuervos In 2012, Javier Rebolledo published La danza de los cuervos (The Dance of the Crows), a book describing the atrocities committed in the Sim√≥n Bol√≠var barracks. He then premiered the movie El Mocito, in which the experiences of a boy who worked in the Sim√≥n Bol√≠var House of Extermination are related. It details the torture and suffering of the political abductees, and mention is made of the use of sarin gas to exterminate the prisoners.

The following day, a teaser trailer for the series was released. Reception=Critical response= The series has been met with a mixed to negative response from critics upon its premiere. On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the first season holds a 27% approval rating, with an average rating of 4.84 out of 10 based on 51 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"The first season of Camping makes it difficult to determine who the least happy campers are: those on the screen or those watching it.\\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the season a score of 50 out of 100 based on 29 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" In a negative review, Varietys Caroline Farmke criticized the series saying, \\"the series wastes its potential, showing so little insight or movement that watching Camping becomes nearly as unpleasant as it is for the characters living through it.\\" In another unfavorable critique, Colliders Andrea Reiher was equally dismissive saying, \\"It truly leaves one wondering: What is the point of this show? If it's not laughs or personal growth, is it just a slice- of-life comedy about unlikable people? That's not enough, especially in this overcrowded TV landscape. Plus, who has the patience to wait half a season or more before finding characters they want to stay with on this journey? Despite high hopes for this combination of Dunham's writing talent and Garner's charisma, there just isn't enough over the first four episodes to really make this a comedy worth tuning into. You can skip this Camping trip.\\" In a more mixed assessment, Indiewire Ben Travers was slightly more positive saying, \\"Camping is certainly an ensemble-driven comedy, and the supporting cast is easier to get behind, but that's like saying it's easier to build a fire with a piece of glass than two rocks. Both will test your patience, and they don't work well together.\\" In a rare positive evaluation, The Wall Street Journals John Anderson described the series as \\"A very funny, quasi-cringy series that takes the Sartre-esque point of view into the great outdoors.\\" Gwen Inhat of The A. V. Club summed up her D+ review, \\"It‚Äôs a waste of a fine cast and a bucolic setting.

It is 1 of 6 high schools in the Akron Public Schools district. The schools mascot is the Golden Rams. They are a member of the Akron City Series athletic conference.  History  Kenmore-Garfield was opened in 2017 as a result of a merger between the former Kenmore High School and Garfield High School. Both schools were historic staples in the city of Akron, Ohio, with Kenmore High School dating back to 1908 and Garfield High School dating back to 1926. Kenmore merged with Garfield for the 2017-18 school year due to declining enrollment and rising costs. The school is currently being operated at the former Kenmore High School building in the Akron neighborhood of Kenmore. Akron Public schools will be rebuilding a new Kenmore-Garfield Community Learning Center as part of the districts district‚Äôs ongoing $800 million renovation and construction program that dates back to 2002. The new CLC will be built on the former Garfield High School site with the tentative building schedule being from the Spring of 2020 with an opening date of Fall 2022. The new Community Learning Center is projected to be 275,000 square feet and will hold about 1,400 students. While the new building is constructed at the Garfield site, the combined school will be known as Kenmore-Garfield, although it is not certain that will be the final name of the school once the CLC is built.  Athletics  Prior to the merger of the schools, both were a part of the Akron City Series athletic conference. The Kenmore High School Cardinals joined when it was merged into the Akron Public School District in 1929, and Garfield High School Golden Rams joined after it was built in 1926.

History  The three four-axle narrow gauge railcars of BD≈Ω class 05 01-03 which were procured in 1941 had proven very good in operation on the Rhodope Railway. In order to cope with the increase in traffic after the Second World War, the BD≈Ω procured four diesel railcars from Ganz Works Budapest in 1952 again. They were similar in construction and appearance to the vehicles of 1941, but more powerfully motorized with a power of . Originally, they were given the same series designation 05 with the ordinal numbers 04-07. From 1965, the four new vehicles were assigned the new class designation 82. With the railcars, six in appearance identical trailers were procured, of which two more followed in 1961. Originally, the railcars were used as well as the three prewar railcars in Septemvri. Among other things, they handled the total traffic between Varvara and Pazardzhik commuting six times a day. Their use on the Rhodope Railway lasted until 1966, when the new class 75 took over all traffic on the route. All railcars were relocated to Cherven Bryag, where they took over a large part of the passenger train service. They could not completely replace the steam locomotives. The use of the narrow gauge railway to Oryahovo lasted until 1977, when the new class 76 took over the traffic. Some car bodies have been preserved after being removed from storage. Thus, a sidecar wreck in Oryahovo behind the station building and in Cherven Bryag two rail car body and a trailer body have been preserved. As a monument, the railcar 82-01 was set up in Bansko. At their delivery, the vehicles had a very modern silver-gray paint. Later, some vehicles were painted blue in the lower half and white in the upper half. Whether vehicles of this series, is not known, all known photos with vehicles of the series 81 have a silver-gray paint.  Technical features  For narrow-gauge conditions these vehicles were designed quite large, much larger than the known narrow-gauge railcars DR 137 322 to 325, which they still towered by three meters in length. But they had about the same number of seats as this series. In one end of the steel skeleton construction of the car body were placed the seats in wood lath construction and in the other end the machinery. Where the diesel engine was located, there was a luggage and payload compartment. The cargo compartment was closed with a central folding door, the entrances for the passengers were via the doors close to the end of the railcar. The entry spaces were the workplaces for the engine driver, on the end not used the controls could be closed by roller blinds.Draft with photos of Railcar class 82 The trailers were similarly designed, they lacked the payload compartments and the center doors. But they had a significantly higher capacity with 62 seats. The engine was Ganz VIII Iat 170/240 that produced and the power transmission was mechanical. The engine gave its torque to the four-speed transmission lying exactly in the middle of the car, both bogie wheels were driven by Cardan shafts. This arrangement gave the railcar an extraordinarily high frictional weight, enabling it to handle any situation on the mountain railway.

She holds a PhD in mathematics from Lehigh University and taught undergraduates at Lafayette College and UVI from 1993 to 2008. In 2008, she became Interim Dean of Science and Mathematics at UVI and four years later was made interim provost. She became the permanent Provost in 2014. McKayle's research focuses on expanding participation of STEM curricula to minority populations. Early life Camille Althea McKayle was born in 1964 in Jamaica, where she completed her primary education and began her secondary schooling. She then moved to New York, where she completed high school and enrolled in mathematics, receiving her Bachelor of Science from Bates College of Lewiston, Maine in 1985. She went on to further her education earning a Master of Science and PhD in mathematics at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylavia in 1993. She completed her thesis Types of Differential Equations Using Polynomial Operators under the direction of Gregory T. McAllister. Around the time of her graduation, McKayle married Robert C. Stolz. Career McKayle began her career in Easton, Pennsylvania teaching at Lafayette College from 1993 to 1996. At that time, she moved to the Virgin Islands, taking a post as an assistant professor of mathematics at the University of the Virgin Islands. While teaching undergraduate math courses, McKayle designed and implemented programs to address the under-representation of minority groups in Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) curricula. In her outreach work, she targeted programs to develop interest in STEM courses for elementary students. Some of the programs she worked on included Girls Exploring Math Stuff (GEMS), a program for 6th grade girls; MathLab, which targets students from the 3rd to the 7th grades; Science Awareness Saturday Academies and the Summer Science Enrichment Academies, as well as workshops for teachers. In 1999, McKayle was the driving force to secure a $3.5 million National Science Foundation grant targeted toward increasing expenditures for STEM students at the University of the Virgin Islands. The funds were to be used to improve curricula, purchase equipment and provide scholarships. McKayle oversaw the program as its director and the university president served as the principal investigator for the project. McKayle was one of four teachers honored with the Millennium Award for outstanding teaching in 2000. The honor, presented by the White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges, recognized McKayle, and fellow teachers Juliette B. Bell of Fayetteville State University, Paul Hudrlik of Howard University and Ashok K. Kabi Satpathy of South Carolina State University. Herbert W. Jones of Florida A&M; University and Ronald E. Mickens of Clark Atlanta University were recognized by the initiative for outstanding research. In 2003, she became coordinator of the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (VI-EPSCoR), with responsibility to oversee a new grant designed to improve K-12 mathematics education on the island. In 2005, McKayle was promoted to an Associate Professor with tenure at UVI and that same year, began working as a Program Officer at the National Science Foundation, in the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program overseeing grants and grant proposals for STEM subjects. Upon her return to UVI after two years working with the National Science Foundation, McKayle was promoted to Interim Dean of Science and Mathematics in 2008. After serving as dean for four years, in July 2012, she was promoted to Interim Provost at UVI. In 2014, her appointment as Provost became permanent and simultaneously she became the Vice President for Academic Affairs.

Prostitution occurs mainly in the capital, Honiara, and around logging camps in Makira, Malaita and Isabel islands. Many of the women involved have turned to prostitution due to poverty, some starting at the age of 13. The laws are rarely enforced. Child prostitution is a problem in the Solomon Islands, sometimes with the complicity of family members. Sex trafficking is also a problem. Legislation The Penal Code of the Solomon Islands criminalises the following prostitution related activities: * Section 144 - Procuration * Section 145 - Procuring defilement of woman by threats or fraud or administering drugs * Section 148 - Detention with intent or in a brothel * Section 153 1(a) - Living wholly or in part on the earnings of prostitution * Section 153 1(b) - Solicitaion * Section 153 1(c) - For the purpose of gain exercises control, direction or influence over a prostitute * Section 155 - Brothels Honiara Central Market In 2009, there were active student surveys of the sex trade involving market women and young girls from the Central Market. In 2014, fishermen, who were paid to transport girls to foreign fishing vessels outside the harbour of Honiara, described the Central Market as one of \\"the most evident or well-known pickup spots\\" for prostitution. RAMSI In 2006, the Solomon Islands' Prime Minister, Manasseh Sogavare, filed a police complaint against the Australian led Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI). He alleged the peacekeeping force were smuggling local women into their base at the former Guadalcanal Beach Resort and using them as prostitutes. The claims were denied by the RAMSI. Sex trafficking The Solomon Islands is a source, transit, and destination country for local and Southeast Asian women subjected to forced prostitution, and local children subjected to sex trafficking. Women from China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines are recruited for legitimate work, some paying large sums of money in recruitment fees, and upon arrival are forced into prostitution. Solomon Island children are subjected to sex trafficking within the country, sometimes in exchange for money or goods, particularly near foreign logging camps, on foreign and local commercial fishing vessels, and at hotels and entertainment establishments. Girls and young women are recruited to travel to logging camps for domestic work and some are subsequently exploited in prostitution. Some parents receive payments for sending young women and girls into forced marriages with foreign workers at logging and mining companies; many of them are exploited in prostitution. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks the Solomon Islands as a \\"Tier 2\\" country.

Based in the fictional town of Elmwood Springs, Missouri, it is a humorous look at Southern mores and small-town mentality in the context of death and the existence of an afterlife. Elner Shimfissle, the octogenarian protagonist, falls out of a tree while picking figs and is rushed to the hospital unconscious, where she is reported dead. The novel satirizes both the response of her neighbors down below‚Äîincluding the food they send for the funeral and the obituary written for a Southern newspaper‚Äîand the view from above, where Elner meets her dead sister, her hero Thomas Alva Edison, and God Himself: her former neighbor, Raymond, a modest, pipe-smoking divinity. Plot Elner Shimfissle, an octogenarian who doesn't know her own age since her sister Ida buried the family Bible to conceal hers, is known and liked by a large circle of friends and admirers. One morning she is picking figs in her tree when she is stung by wasps, falls off the ladder, and loses consciousness. She is rushed to the hospital in Kansas City, where she apparently dies. Back home, Elner's acquaintances tidy her house, feed her cat, and start preparing for her funeral. Elner, meanwhile, wakes up in her pitch-black hospital room and calls for assistance. Not receiving any, she goes out to the hallway and enters an elevator, which takes her straight \\"up.\\" Her sister Ida greets her at Heaven's gates and then she is ushered upstairs to meet God and ask any questions she likes. Besides sporting such fanciful things as polka-dotted squirrels and unusually colored landscapes, Heaven also looks like her hometown, Elmwood Springs, about 50 years in the past. Elner meets God‚Äîher former neighbor Raymond, a modest, pipe-smoking divinity‚Äîand they discuss how he and his wife Dorothy created mankind and the current state of the world. Then Raymond sends Elner back down to Elmwood Springs, where she wakes up in her hospital bed and sets in motion another round of shocked neighbors who are incredulous that she's really alive. Elner lives a few more years after that and finally dies peacefully in her sleep, as she'd always wanted to. The novel closes with a series of recipes for the various dishes that Elner's neighbors made to send to her funeral. Setting Like Flagg's 2002 novel Standing in the Rainbow, the story is based in the fictional town of Elmwood Springs, Missouri. Elner has appeared as a minor character in other Flagg novels, including the 2016 novel The Whole Town's Talking. Critical reception Reviewers praised the book for its spot-on depiction of Southern small-town life and mores, complete with sentimental, plain-speaking characters. \\"This is the sort of place where everyone looks out for everyone else and nobody minds their own business,\\" writes The Guardian. The Bookreporter adds: \\"Flagg effortlessly transports you to a world of old ‚Äì a place where your front porch was the place to go, where neighbors looked out for each other, and a cool glass of iced tea cured all the world's ills\\". Charlotte Hays, writing for The Washington Post, notes: \\"Southern readers also will be intimately acquainted with Elmwood Springs's characteristic form of grief therapy: carbs. Can't Wait to Get to Heaven ‚Äì the title comes from a gospel song Elner has requested in advance ‚Äì supplies recipes for several of those gooey comfort foods that neighbors bring practically before the body is cold. 'Nothing too spicy', Flagg writes. 'When you are upset, you need bland and simple cream-based food'\\". Hays further points out that the obituary written for the local newspaper reflects the Southern tendency \\"to flatter both the deceased and their survivors\\".

An updated version of the Spurrell Dictionary is still published by HarperCollins as the Collins Spurrell Welsh Dictionary (). Spurrell was a Conservative in politics, and from 1857 until 1885, was the proprietor and publisher of Yr Haul. Established at Llandovery by David Owen (Brutus), this was one of the few Welsh language periodicals to adopt an Anglican and Conservative perspective at a time when nonconformism and the Liberal Party were becoming increasingly prevalent in Welsh society. Before establishing the University of Wales Press, Spurrell was printing and publishing standard books on behalf of the University of Wales and also on behalf of the National Library of Wales for a period. Spurrell died on 22 April 1889 (Easter Monday) at the age of 75. He was buried in the cemetery at St David's Church, Carmarthen.

This timescale of this process can range from several hours to a few days. He works with art materials strapped about his person, and allows the movement of the ocean and its waves to paint his pictures for him. He has been identified as being part of a long English tradition of maritime art, whilst his abstract style has been compared to that of American expressionist Jasper Johns. His creative process has occasionally led him into danger, and has resulted in his receiving injuries, and even catching diseases. Matthews' work has been exhibited internationally, as well as being used to illustrate aspects of scientific research in marine biology.  Background  Peter Mathews was born in 1978. Originally from Derby, he spent much of his youth exploring the countryside of Derbyshire, particularly its forests and rivers. Matthews ascribes these early hikes to his attraction to solitude. In an interview with BBC News, he described his feeling of allure to the \\"mysterious and omnipresent call of the wild.\\" As an artist, however, Matthews calls Cornwall his \\"ancestral\\" home. His maternal grandfather \\"sold fish in Leicester,\\" says Matthews, \\"so I like to think it's in my roots,\\" on working at sea . Although he personally rejects the description of environmental artist, he has also been called an \\"ocean based visual artist,\\" and on one occasion even a \\"mystical waterman.\\" His work, focussed on the sea as it is, has been identified as part of a long tradition of British artists' fascination with the maritime, which includes artists as Turner (Fishermen at Sea and Snow Storm: Steam-Boat off a Harbour's Mouth) and Constable (Seascape Study with Rain Clouds). Andrew Friend, a contemporary of Matthews,' also takes an immersive approach to his own seascapes. Matthews original inspiration for his way of working was a 2007 near-death experience. This occurred while he was surfing off Mexico, when the sea became increasingly rough and he became separated from his surfboard. He was eventually hit by a rogue wave; by then he was \\"floundering in the ocean with a gut-wrenching sense of fear, being completely at the mercy of the ocean,\\" he later recalled.  Technique  Matthews' Interim (2017), created using oil, acrylic, pencil and oil bar on canvas, illustrates his technique. Matthews' has created his work in the earth's oceans, Cornwall, Hawaii, and Taiwan. In doing so, he can spend long periods‚Äîranging from hours to days‚Äî floating or submerging in the ocean. He keeps his artistic media either cached in his hat or strapped to his wrists or ankles. This includes charcoal and gel pens, and the surfaces he draws on can range from paper to canvas sheeting, pinned to \\"old piece of plywood\\" which acts both as a drawing board and a floatation device. Working this way, it has been said, helps Matthews try and capture the state of suspension people feel while they are bobbing in the water. This methood also allows him to explore‚Äîin his words‚Äî\\"the fluid midpoint between sea and land, thought and form.\\" Matthews often enters the water at dawn and may stay immersed until nightfall, and effectively \\"lets the ocean do the work for him\\"; sometimes the work is left exposed to the elements and tides overnight in which the piece continues its natural development. Matthews has described himself as merely being the \\"instrument\\" by which the sea \\"draw[s] itself.\\" Matthews' work has itself encountered danger, having been buried on a beach by a mudslide (never to be found again) and on other occasions being swept away or sinking in the sea. Problems Matthews personally faces are those of his environment‚Äîhe has suffered numbness, hypothermia and sunstroke, as well as receiving dog-, snake-, jellyfish- and insect-bites. As a result, his working method has been described \\"eccentric.\\" To get himself in the mindset to create the piece entitled With the Forces of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, Matthews constructed a speaker system out of a CD player and a tripod. He then played himself recordings of the sound of the Pacific Ocean over a period of days, floating in the Atlantic Ocean. On one occasion Matthews submerged himself to the ocean bed where he used waterproof ink on canvasses weighted down with rocks, whilst, when in California, he slept in the Californian desert and painted with \\"one of the blackest paints on Earth.\\"  Reception  Matthews has exhibited internationally, with sale prices in the Saatchi Gallery reaching thousands of pounds. His work has been exhibited in Wirksworth, Turin, Dortmund, Folkestone, and Laguna Beach. He has lectured for university audiences (at, for instance, the University of California, San Diego), and was the artist-in-residence at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Matthews' style has been compared‚Äîin its \\"scratchy, abstract\\" nature‚Äîwith the work of Cy Twombly and Jasper Johns, but with a greater degree of stream of consciousness, often bordering \\"the brilliant and the ridiculous.\\" Other critic's comments have described his work as \\"mind-boggling oceanography with Native American mythology, plus a splash of quirky inventiveness,\\" and as being \\"nervously textured.\\" The University of California, San Diego has used Matthews work as an example of how popular interest in subjects such as marine biology and maritime history can be developed and encouraged.

The color layers were applied using lithographic techniques, and then the embossing was used to give relief to buildings, walls, mountains and other architectural and geographic features. Sometimes, the raised elements of the map were left unprinted, such as in Bauerkeller's 1846 map of Paris, while the rest of the picture was printed with vivid colors. The same method was sometimes used for the production of relief prints of buildings, plants, sculptures, landscape views or other graphic motives. Several of these maps were exposed at the Industrial World Fair of Paris in 1839. The technique was developed by the German printer Georg Michael Bauerkeller (1805 - 1886) and his half-brother Georg Leonhart Bauerkeller, who worked in Frankfurt am Main and in Karlsruhe before opening a printing and embossing office in Paris in the late 1930s. Georg Michael Bauerkeller deposited a patent application for his invention in France, in January the 18th, 1839. However, even if the manufacturing process was patented, the term geomontographie (geomontography) was not. The process was adopted for the teaching of the blind, and maps embossed in that manner where employed at Paris' Institut des Jeunes Aveugles (Institute for the Blind Youth), that were offered to the children for them to finger-read. Laas d'Aguen, a supervisor of the institute, reinforced the printed maps by embossing additional layers of blank paper using the same platen, so the paper sheets would stick together creating a rigid cardboard material. This was done so to avoid deforming and damaging the paper under the blind readers finger's pressure.

In collaboration with photographers Emily Shur and Wyatt Gallery, Thomas and For Freedoms transformed Norman Rockwell‚Äôs depictions of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt‚Äôs 1941 address to Congress, which articulated FDR‚Äôs vision of the four basic human freedoms. Thomas wrote that \\"The image haunted me because of the world we live in. I wanted to imagine what it would look like today.\\" Through dozens of iterations of Rockwell‚Äôs original four paintings, the 82 images in the campaign attempted to reflect the immeasurable diversity of American identities today. Celebrities such as Rosario Dawson, Dolores Huerta, Gina Belafonte, Van Jones, Jesse Williams, Robert A. Nakamura and Karen L. Ishizuka, Kiran Gandhi, Michael Ealy, Saul Williams, Rodney Barnette, and others were included in the reinterpretations. The new version of the images were widely shared on social media and Instagram, including by celebrities such as Alicia Keys and Jada Pinkett-Smith.https://news.artnet.com/art- world/for-freedoms-rockwell-1384654 = 2020 Awakening = In fall 2020, For Freedoms announced the 2020 Awakening campaign centered around the new four freedoms of awakening listening, healing, and justice. The campaign, inspired by the 1860s youth-led organization who championed the election of Abraham Lincoln, the Wide Awakes, features billboards as well as digital advertising spaces. Among the artists who will participate in the 2020 Awakening campaign include Christine Sun Kim, the Guerrilla Girls, Alfredo Jaar, Edgar Heap of Birds, Kameelah Janan Rasheed, Marilyn Minter, and Carlos Motta, as well as curators Jasmine Wahi and Rujeko Hockley. An accompanying digital publication, the Infinite Playbook, outlines how individuals and institutions participate in collective action to increase voter engagement and build a cultural and political identity around listening, healing, and justice.

During the later part of the 19th Century, the South Philadelphia neighborhood that is now called Pennsport was quickly growing, due to influx of impoverished immigrants. Between 1873 and 1915, was the final entry point for an estimated 1 million European immigrants searching for promising futures, was Philadelphia's first immigrant station at Pier 53, the Washington Avenue Immigration Station, located just north of the Pennsport neighborhood. Philadelphia was America's second-largest city, a thriving industrial center, and a vital force in the American economy. The city also remained major transportation hub and gateway to America and Pennsylvania's industrial empire. Though only a fraction-no more than 5 percent-of the people who immigrated to the United States during those years, the newcomers who entered through Philadelphia represented every ethnic and religious group that comprised America's so-called \\"New Immigrants\\" who arrived between the 1880s and the outbreak of the First World War. In 1882 there was the great migration from Russia of Jewish migrants to Philadelphia that settled in the Pennsport neighborhood during this time period and many suffered from a severe lack of medical services. Numerous organizations failed in instituting a medical facility to aid these immigrants in the neighborhood. Ultimately, at the turn of the Twentieth Century, the Beth Israel Hospital Association was established in order to solve the problem. This establishment successfully treated the area‚Äôs poor Jewish population and also accepted patients from other faiths. Beth Israel was absorbed by the Franklin Free Dispensary only a few months after beginning their operation. At around the same time, Jewish physicians opened their Mount Sinai Dispensary in Society Hill, however because of their common goal, both dispensaries, Franklin Free and Mount Sinai, agreed to merge and renamed themselves the Mount Sinai Hospital Association. Philadelphia city laws stated that hospitals treating consumptives (now known as Tuberculosis) or immigrants, could not be built near homes and churches. The Mount Sinai Hospital Association considered building the facility outside of the city however they knew that it had to be built near where patients lived. By 1904, the law was amended after lobbying the city government and the association procured an old lumber yard on the 1400 block of South 5th Street, central to the Pennsport neighborhood, that was the most in need. The $25,000 purchase included the yard‚Äôs four-story building (built in 1893), which would become the first Mount Sinai Hospital. In March 1905, Mount Sinai Hospital officially opened to the public and accepted its first patients. In 1952, Mount Sinai Hospital merged with Northern Liberties Hospital and the Jewish Hospital to form a single medical center. The hospital closed in 1997 and was demolished in 2016.

The Coast Guard vessels met with , a from New Zealand, to prepare for actual joint missions. On February 19, 2020, the Coast Guard's Honolulu station described an incident where a scuba diver's report of the loss of his dive-float helped their life-saving efforts. Divers use standardized highly visible dive-floats to indicate to boaters where they are diving, so they can take steps to avoid those areas, which helps keep divers safe from being run over, when they come to the surface, and are hard to see. Coast Guard personnel who encounter an unattended dive-float normally treat it as an emergency, indicating that a diver is in distress, or has drowned. However, since this diver self-reported the loss of his float, when Joseph Gerczak encountered his float, they were aware the owner was safe, and this was not an emergency. Namesake In 2010, Charles \\"Skip\\" W. Bowen, who was then the United States Coast Guard's most senior non-commissioned officer, proposed that all 58 cutters in the Sentinel class should be named after enlisted sailors in the Coast Guard, or one of its precursor services, who were recognized for their heroism.

The species was named after Giles W. Mead of the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology, a biology professor at Harvard, deep sea explorer, and ichthyologist. History Ipnops were first discovered and named in 1878 by Dr. Albert G√ºnther during the expedition of . Ipnops was originally classified as a broad species of abyssal flat-headed fish with either very small eyes or membranes covering their eyes. Due to recent scientific advancements and increased deep-sea expeditions, the Ipnops genus now divided into three species (I.agassizi, I.meadi, I.murrayi) based on geographic location. Most information on Ipnops species has been collected via deep-sea expeditions, the most prominent being HMS Challenger (1878), ‚ÄúGalathea‚Äù(1950‚Äì52), and ‚ÄúOkeanos‚Äù (2017). Since Ipnops are rather difficult to locate and photograph at high resolution, very little is known about any of the three species. Habitat Due to their rarity, and lack of photos, the three species of Ipnops (I. agassizi, I. meadi and I. murrayi) are distinguished by the depth and location of which they reside. I. meadi and I. agassizi are found in the Indo-Pacific Ocean, and I. murrayi are found in the Atlantic and Caribbean Sea. Ipnops agassizi, meadi, and murrayi also differ by which the depths they occupy. I. agassizi and murrayi are found at depths 3,000 meters and above, while I. meadi are found from 3,300-5,000 meters. Diet Stomach dissections of I. meadi indicate the species primarily feed on small crustaceans. Physiology Ipnops murrayiSince all three species of Ipnops are primarily distinguished by their geography, all three species have roughly the same physiology. All Ipnops are generally characterized as long and slender fish lacking traditional ocular lenses found on most marine organisms. In place of eyes, grideye fish have flat bony membranes on top of their skull which act as photosensitive plates. Ipnops also have large mouths, given their size, and sharp, pointed teeth on both the palatine and vomer regions of the mouth. Based on the dissection of multiple samples, all species have roughly 13-15 anal rays, 13-15 pectoral fin rays, and 54-58 vertebrae. However, due to the species similarity, some scientists have suggested the Ipnops are hybrids and not reproductively isolated, or that Ipnops should just be a single species. From collections and dissections of Ipnops species, there are a few characteristics specific to I. meadi, compared to the other two species, including: *Higher average number of lateral line scales *Higher average number of vertebrae *Higher average number of gill rakes on the anterior arch *Absence of otoliths =Size= *Average standard length of juvenile and adult Ipnops meadi ranges from 55-121mm. *Larval Ipnops measured a standard length of 14mm. =Photosensitive plates= The photosensitive plates of the Ipnops are theorized to be sensors that exclusively detect the presence or absence of light. Some scientists hypothesized that the plates serve as an adaptive protection mechanism, helping the Ipnops detect bioluminescence from predators. =Reproduction= Dissections of Ipnops species‚Äô gonads indicate that these fish are hermaphroditic and lay an average of 900 eggs per clutch. Larval stages and development Currently, there is only one study of larval Ipnops. This study found the larva in shallower depths (1600m) which suggest larvae move to the surface during their development and return to the depths once they are adults The larva also had very large eyes and no presence of the membrane which covers adult Ipnops eyes. This indicates that as larva develop, they lose their sense of sight and their eyeballs transition into the photosensitive plates. However, this is purely hypothetical and more studies need to be conducted before the scientific community can be certain.

A native Chicagoan, he is best known for his experimental films Remembrance: A Portrait Study (1967) and Private Imaginings and Narrative Facts (1968-70).  Personal Life and Influences  As a teenager, Owens, a resident of Chicago's South Side, spent his free time experimenting with 8mm film. He went on to study painting and sculpture at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC). There he met the experimental filmmaker Gregory Markopoulos, who had founded the school's film program. Markopoulos was impressed with Owens' film work and urged him to move to New York City, which he did in 1966. In New York, Markpoulous became a mentor for Owens, introducing him to influential figures in filmmaking and art such as Andy Warhol, Gerard Malanga, Marie Menken, Gregory Battcock and Charles Boultenhouse. In 1971, after making a few portrait style films in New York and successfully entering the film scene, he moved back to Chicago. He ended his film career at the young age of 20, when his self proclaimed drug addiction and undiagnosed bipolar disorder began to take their toll. The films that now survive from Owen's body of work are three experimental films he made as an 18 year old entering New York's underground film community.  Career = Style = Owens' films can characterized by their painterly approach and personal feel. His films from 1966-1970 displayed growth within mastering a form. Originally inspired by Markopoulous' own style, Owens was able to create something within his own right. Owens' film are recognizable for their dramatic lighting and the use of superimposition and layering of images. His featurette Tomorrow's Promise (1967) tells a story of emptiness. Created when Owens was only 18 years old, it references Markopoulos's Twice a Man (1963). Owens' approach to lighting and layered images, as well as changes in orientation and color, convey Owens' version of his personal life. Owens' film Remembrance: A Portrait Study (1967) is a portrait of Owens' mother Mildered, and her friends Irene Collins and Nettie Thomas. Within the film, each person is personified through song. \\"Running Wild\\" by Marilyn Monroe accompanies Nettie, while \\"All Cried Out\\" by Dusty Springfield accompanies Mildred. Private Imaginings and Narrative Facts (1968‚Äì70) focuses more directly on Owens' mother, layering her image with those from magazines and other pop cultural sources. = Filmography = *The Illiac Passion (1964-67) *Autrefois J'ai aime une femme (1966) * Tomorrow's Promise (1967) * Remembrance: A Portrait Study (1967) * Private Imaginings and Narrative Facts (1968‚Äì70)  Death  In 1971, Owens left New York due to personal reasons and returned to his home state of Illinois. He died, without completing another film, at the age of 60.  Recognition  While Owens' film Remembrance: A Portrait Study graces Parker Tyler's list of the most significant avant-garde films of 1968 in his Underground Film: A Critical History (1969), his work was largely unknown to contemporary audiences until the 2000s, sitting in storage at the Film-Makers Cooperative in New York City. In 2006, Ronald Gregg included Owens' films into a screening series at the University of Chicago titled \\"Beyond Warhol, Smith, and Anger: Recovering the Significance of Postwar Queer Underground Cinema, 1950-1968\\". In 2009, the film programmer Ed Halter discovered Owens' work in the Filmmaker's Coop collection and began working to spark the public's recognition of Edward Owen's work by rediscovering and redistributing his work as well as conducting personal interviews with Owens to better understand his creative vision. In 2017, curators Mark Godfrey and Zo√© Whitley included Owens' films in the exhibition Soul of a Nation: Art In the Age of Black Power, calling them \\"not only early examples of an experimental filmmaker turning to Black life for their subject, but an even rare case of a queer Black aesthetic on celluloid.\\" Owens' films have also been screened at the Gene Siskel Film Center in Chicago (2018), Ed Halter via Skype.

The film also stars Doleac along with Lindsay Anne Williams, Steven Brand, Andrew Divoff, John Schneider, Gary Grubbs, Kristina Emerson, and Jessica Harthcock.  Plot  Eight years ago, Father Colin Hampstead presided over an aborted exorcism that resulted in the gruesome death of seventeen-year-old Jewel Grant, in rural Louisiana. The deceased girl‚Äôs older sister, Kayleigh, grew immediately attached to Hampstead and sought him out, at first for grief counseling and then, for more. The once-zealous Father Hampstead soon left the priesthood, disillusioned with religion, but comforted by his love for Kayleigh. Colin and Kayleigh marry, but, on the night of their wedding, Kayleigh has a vision of her dead sister. Now, Colin Hampstead has become a celebrated fiction writer, specializing in stories about the occult. He and Kayleigh have a daughter, and run a well-known bed and breakfast in Savannah, Georgia. When the couple agrees to host the wedding of one of Colin‚Äôs old friends, what begins as a jovial reunion turns into something much more macabre, as the seemingly omnipresent ghost of Kayleigh‚Äôs sister Jewel compels Kayleigh to engage in bizarre, destructive behaviors that endanger the lives of both her friends and herself. Told in two timelines, past and present, the film slowly unravels the unsettling circumstances of Jewel‚Äôs death, while tracing Kayleigh‚Äôs struggle to understand why her sister haunts her.

Still, Doleac's forging a niche. His name on a picture is now an indication that genre fans will see something different...\\" Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 33%, with an average rating of 5/10, based on 6 reviews.https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/demons_2017  References External links * 2017 films 2017 horror films American films American supernatural horror films Demons in film English-language films Films about Catholic priests Religious horror films ","title":"Demons (2017 film)"},{"id":"56535424","text":"Chenopodium nitrariaceum, commonly known as the nitre goosefoot, is a shrub in the subfamily Chenopodioideae of the family Amaranthaceae (sensu lato), native to Australia.

It is a complex combination of symptoms, amounting to a headache syndrome, that was originally hypothesized to be due to cervical spondylosis. Damage to the posterior cervical sympathetic chain due to the degeneration of the cervical vertebra was theorized to play a role in this syndrome by the prolapsing of disc in the mid-cervical spine. However, the medical theory as was originally postulated was found to contain inconsistencies. Barr√©‚ÄìLi√©ou syndrome is regarded by many current medical researchers as synonymous with cervicogenic headache. Thus, the original works of Barr√© and Li√©ou were foundational in identifying a crucial feature that distinguishes cervicogenic headache from other headache syndromes‚Äîthe concept that the pain originates from a structural abnormality in the cervical spine. Symptoms Patients with Barr√©‚ÄìLi√©ou syndrome may have complaints of: * Headache * Neck pain * Orofacial pain * Ear pain * Toothache * Tinnitus * Nasal congestion Diagnosis One test to check for Barr√©‚ÄìLi√©ou syndrome is through the use of thermography. An MRI study may also be conducted to rule out any structural problems in the neck which may be the cause of this syndrome. Some of the treatments for this disorder consist of sympathetic nerve blocks, physical therapy, neck brace and traction.

He also was President of the Senate. Early life and education Abdo Ben√≠tez was born in Asunci√≥n on 10 November 1971 and is the son of Ruth Ben√≠tez Perrier and Mario Abdo Ben√≠tez Sr. His father's ancestry is Lebanese. At 16 years old, Abdo Ben√≠tez moved to the United States. He then completed his university studies at Teikyo Post University in Waterbury, Connecticut, obtaining a degree in marketing. Upon completion of his secondary schooling in 1989 he joined the Paraguayan Armed Forces, obtaining the rank of Second Lieutenant of Reserve Aviation and in turn was appointed by the Air Force Command as a paratrooper. Early political career His first steps in politics were in 2005 as a member of the Republican National Reconstruction movement. He was later a member of the Peace and Progress movement and won the Vice Presidency of the Colorado Party in 2005. In June 2015, he was elected president of the Senate of Paraguay. Abdo Ben√≠tez has faced criticism for his relationship with the military dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, as his father was Stroessner's private secretary. When Stroessner died in 2006, Abdo Ben√≠tez was one of the pallbearers at his funeral in Bras√≠lia, and Abdo Ben√≠tez later proposed that the Governing Board of the Colorado Party pay tribute to Stroessner. The fortune Abdo Ben√≠tez owns was inherited from his father, who after the fall of the dictatorship was prosecuted for illicit enrichment, but the case was eventually dismissed. Abdo Ben√≠tez has stated that while he believes that Stroessner \\"did a lot for the country\\", he also clarified that he does not condone the violations of human rights, torture and persecution committed during the regime.

In April 2018, Abdo Ben√≠tez won the 2018 elections by defeating Efra√≠n Alegre, with 46.46% of the votes to Alegre's 42.73%. At age 46 Abdo Ben√≠tez became, alongside Nicanor Duarte Frutos, the youngest President of Paraguay since the fall of Stroessner's dictatorship. Abdo Ben√≠tez was inaugurated as president on 15 August 2018. His predecessor Horacio Cartes, with whom he was in conflict, was not present at the ceremony. =Domestic policy= U.S. President Donald Trump meets with Paraguayan President Abdo Ben√≠tez in December 2019.

Like his opponent at the elections Alegre, he opposes the legalization of abortion and same-sex marriage, though he stated to be \\"open\\" to a \\"debate\\" on abortion. Abdo with President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro. In mid-2019, he faced the possibility of an impeachment procedure for having signed an agreement with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on the Itaipu Dam, which was considered to be clearly unfavourable for Paraguay. He finally had this agreement cancelled, defusing the impeachment process. On economic issues, Abdo Benitez's government continues the policy pursued for a century in favor of large landowners. Abdo Benitez's government designed a tax reform that was approved by Congress in September 2019. In 2019, the Paraguayan economy went into recession. One year after taking office, the government has experienced a high rate of disapproval of its management (69.3% in August 2019). As a result, the phrase \\"Desastre ko Marito\\" (a mixture of Guarani and Spanish roughly meaning \\"Marito is a disaster\\") became widespread in use, spawning merchandising.

It is a small orchid with up to eighteen dark, purplish-black flowers and is only known from six sites on the south coast where it grows in shallow soil over rhyolite.  Description  Genoplesium rhyoliticum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single thin leaf long and fused to the flowering stem with the free part long. Between five and eighteen dark purplish-black flowers are crowded along a flowering stem long and taller than the leaf. The flowers are about long and wide and as with others in the genus, are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is narrow egg-shaped, about long and wide, with dark bands and hairless edges. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, about long, wide, and nearly parallel to each other. The petals are narrow egg-shaped, about long and wide with a pointed tip and sometimes a few hairs on the edges. The labellum is egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long and wide with coarse hairs along its edges. There is a narrow triangular callus in the centre of the labellum and extending almost to its tip. Flowering occurs in December and January.  Taxonomy and naming  Genoplesium rhyoliticum was first described in 1991 by David Jones and Mark Clements from a specimen collected near Pambula and the description was published in Australian orchid Research. In 2002 Jones and Clements changed the name to Corunastylis rhyolitica. The specific epithet (rhyoliticum) refers to the rock type on which this orchid grows.  Distribution and habitat  The Pambula midge-orchid usually grows in very shallow soil over rhyolite without shrubs or trees, but sometimes under shrubs in heath. It only occurs in six sites near Pambula.  Conservation  Of the six populations of G. rhyoliticum, three occur in the South East Forests National Park and the only known threat to the species is grazing by native mammals. The species is listed as \\"Endangered\\" under the New South Wales Threatened Species Conservation Act and the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act.

Until 1912, it was the official newspaper of the Women's Social and Political Union, the leading suffragette organisation. Subsequently, it continued with a smaller circulation, at first independently, and then as the publication of the United Suffragists. History The newspaper was founded in October 1907 by Emmeline and Frederick Pethick- Lawrence. The couple became joint editors of the newspaper, which was published by the St Clement's Press. It was adopted as the official newspaper of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), already the leading militant suffragette organisation in the country. Many copies were sold by WSPU members standing on the street. The pavement sellers were often harassed by passersby, and were forced to stand in the gutter lest the police arrest them for \\"obstruction of the pavement\\". Initially, the newspaper cost 3d and was published monthly, with weekly supplements bringing it up-to-date. In April 1908, its publication was increased to a weekly frequency, and the following month the price was dropped to only 1d. During this period, the WSPU viewed the paper as a tool for recruitment and fundraising, and devoted much time to increasing its circulation. Posters advertising the paper were designed by Hilda Dallas, an artist in the Suffragette Atelier. And for example, each summer, WSPU members were urged to recruit new subscribers while they were on seaside holidays. The paper was redesigned in 1909 and its page size was increased. The WSPU launched a major advertising campaign, including Helen Craggs and others on an omnibus touring London, and established permanent sales pitches in central London. This took circulation to a peak of 33,000 a week in early 1910. In 1912 the Pethick-Lawrences were arrested, and Evelyn Sharp briefly assumed the editorship of the paper. Subsequently, the Pethick- Lawrences were expelled from the WSPU, and thereafter they published the newspaper independently, its supporters being organised in the Votes for Women Fellowship. This group was intended to encompass members of a variety of women's suffrage organisations, whether militant or non-militant. The Fellowship formed groups across the country, which focused their time on education. This convinced some members that they should form a new campaigning group. In February 1914, Votes for Women announced the formation of the United Suffragists, in which the Pethick-Lawrences became active, and in August they transferred control of the newspaper to the new group. Sharp then took over sole editorship of the newspaper. Later years The paper continued to appear during World War I, but with a much-reduced circulation, and it struggled to remain financially viable. Sharp reoriented the paper to appeal more to middle-class women, with the slogan \\"The War Paper for Women\\". Although she personally came to oppose the war, she ensured that the paper maintained a neutral stance on it. Women's suffrage was enacted by degrees beginning in 1918, and in March of that year the United Suffragists dissolved itself, the newspaper also ceasing to appear.

The station is notorious for being retrofitted to be a fallout shelter capable of holding the entire population of Cincinnati. Fencing and lights were installed during this time period. The station was planned in 1916, but lacked funding to complete.  History  Construction of the Cincinnati Subway began in the early 1900s to upgrade the Cincinnati Streetcar system, however due to political arguments, World War 1 and the Great Depression during the 1920s and 1930s, the construction of the subway system in Cincinnati was indefinitely cancelled, leaving all the stations of the subway to be abandoned. In the 1960s, Liberty Street station was converted into an underground nuclear bunker as a proposition by the Hamilton County, unfortunately the result was very weak because it would not provide much for those residing in it. There were also suggestions by investors to turn the tunnels into passages for freight trains, but the project failed due to the sharp turns existing in the tunnels that freight trains could not handle. In 2002, the station was proposed to be part of the MetroMoves light rail system until the plans were rejected.  Establishment  The entrance to the station is located near a Warner Bros Pictures studio in Cincinnati, Ohio with caution tape bordered over it.Warner Bros Pictures studio in Cincinnati, Ohio. The east platform of the now-retrofitted bunker has lighting, ventilation, food, and communications equipment installed. The station's bunks were also placed in the station's bathrooms, and the platform was divided into several small rooms with cinder blocks with an erected chain link fence. At the platform edge, the tunnels weren't sealed off from the shelter, making it vulnerable to vandalism, particularly spray paint graffiti. North up the outbound platform are two rows of pillars, the small rooms built between the wall and the first row of pillars.A room at the north end of the platform stretches almost to the platform edge. Another area along the back row of pillars was painted lime green, but not turned into a room. The bench was the only piece of furnishing installed in any of the stations. The shelter light fixtures on the ceiling still have bulbs in them, but the electricity has been cut off. Inside the station is an empty ticket booth with empty window frames, a fuse or circuit breaker box, and graffiti on the walls.

Early life Charles Nassau was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1804 to Reverend William Nassau, a ruling elder at the Second Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia, and Ann Nassau (n√©e Parkinson). The family descended from the Duchy of Nassau, through Charles Henry Von Nassau, the chief hunt master to Augustus II the Strong, the King of Saxony. Nassau initially attended school at the University of Pennsylvania, graduating on July 26, 1821, and studied Hebrew the following year with a professor from the school. Nassau attended Princeton Theological Seminary for one year before leaving due to health problems, and completed his seminary with the Presbytery of Philadelphia on April 23, 1824. Nassau was ordained by the Presbytery on November 16, 1825. Career After his ordainment, Nassau was a pastor in Norristown, Pennsylvania from 1825 to 1828, leaving due to another complaint with his health. From 1829 to 1833 he taught at an all-boys school in Philadelphia before overcoming his health issues and practicing as a pastor, again in Norristown, from 1832 to 1833. Starting in 1836, Nassau became a professor of Latin and Greek at Marion College, in Hannibal, Missouri. He stayed here for two years before transferring to teach ancient languages at Lafayette College from 1841 to 1849. In 1848, Lafayette College was under dire financial stress due to a lacking endowment. The previous president, George Junkin, resigned in the 1848 school year leaving the college without a president. In a state of emergency, Nassau was elected as president in 1849. Despite Nassau's education, he was unable to turn the financial situation around, and left the position in September, 1850 when debtors began to take legal action against the school. After the presidency at Lafayette, Nassau became head of the Young Ladies' Seminary in Lawrenceville, New Jersey. He served in this position until 1875, and the seminary prospered well during his tenure. After 1875, Nassau resigned from this position to retire in Trenton, New Jersey. Personal life Nassau married Hannah Hamill on April 11, 1826, with whom he had eleven children. In 1850, Nassau was awarded with an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree from Jefferson College (now Washington & Jefferson College). He died in Trenton on August 6, 1878.

It was written in a style influenced by the Decameron of Giovanni Boccaccio, the Golden Legend collection of saint lives, the Seven Sages of Rome or the Gemma ecclesiastica of Giraldus Cambrensis. For its historical facts, however, it relies on the Nuova Cronica of Giovanni Villani. It is said to be an influence on Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice.Bloom, Harold (2007). Heims, Neil, ed. The Merchant of Venice. New York: Infobase. pp.112‚Äì113 Summary of \\"Il Pecorone\\" by Giovanni Fiorentino abridged from Johnson's summary: Giannetto, a young noble of Florence, whose father has left him no money, comes to Venice and is befriended by his godfather Ansaldo, the richest merchant there. One day Giannetto expresses a desire to make a voyage to Alexandria, so as to see something of the world; Ansaldo furnishes him with a fine ship and much merchandise, and off he starts. Sailing along the Venetian coast he observes a beautiful port and asks the captain whose it is. The captain says that it belongs to a widow who has become very rich by gaining the fortunes of many lovers; for she has made it a law that whoever puts into the harbour( which is called Belmonte ) must woo her, and if he fails to fulfil certain difficult conditions, give up to her everything he has brought with him. Many have tried, but the lady (who is extremely beautiful) has drugged and tricked them. So Giannetto puts into port, tries, fails, loses his valuable ship and merchandise, and returns to Venice with the story that he has been shipwrecked; and Ansaldo receives him again into his house. A little time passes and then Giannetto again expresses a wish to travel; and Ansaldo provides him with yet costlier vessel. He reaches Belmonte, is unsuccessful again over the hard conditions, loses his property as before, and comes back to Venice. However, he is determined to make a third venture, so persuades Ansaldo to provide a third ship. Ansaldo consents, but he has spent so much money already on Giannetto that his fortune has run very low, and he has to borrow 10,000 ducats of a Jew- on the condition that if he fails to repay the loan by the Feast of St. John in the next month of June, the Jew may take a pound of flesh from any part of his body. The contract is signed, the ship and the merchandise got ready, and Giannetto departs. Before he goes, Ansaldo who has more than a foreboding that he may not be able to repay the money, gets Giannetto to promise that if anything happens to him (Ansaldo), he will return to Venice to bid him farewell:if Giannetto does this, he can leave the world with satisfaction. And Giannetto promises. At this third venture he succeeds, through a hint from one of the lady's waiting-maids, wins and marries the lady, lives very happily and forgets all about poor Ansaldo. One day as he stands at the window of the lady's palace he sees a procession pass and asks the reason. It is Saint John's day, they tell him, and instantly he remembers that this is the fatal day for Ansaldo. He is greatly agitated, his wife enquires the cause, and, learning, bids him to hurry to Venice with 100,000 ducats to pay the debt, in case Ansaldo has not been able. It is too late however; Ansaldo has failed to pay; other merchants would discharge the debt willingly for him, but the Jew refuses and will not take even 100,000 ducats. Meanwhile the lady is hastening to Venice. She is disguised as a lawyer from the University of Bologna( and we will call her the Lawyer now). Arrived at an inn, the lawyer is told of this case about which all Venice is talking. He gives out that he is ready to determine difficult cases, and this one is referred to him though the Jew declares that he means to have his penalty, whatever the lawyer may say. The lawyer reasons with the Jew and urges him to take 100,000 ducats which Giannetto ( who does not recognize the lawyer) offers. But the Jew refuses, and the lawyer says there is no help- the pound of flesh must be taken. Just as the Jew is about to cut it, the lawyer interrupts: \\"Take care what you do: do not cut more or less, and shed no blood: else you must die.\\" The Jew protests, but in vain and then asks for the 100,000 ducats ; but the lawyer says \\"no:\\" the Jew has rejected the money, and now he shall have no money at all, not even the loan of 10,000 ducats, but only the flesh, if he will run the risk. It ends in the Jew during of the bond and leaving the court in a rage. Giannetto presses the lawyer to accept the 100,000 ducats, but he will only have a ring that Giannetto is wearing. Giannetto is loath to give it, but eventually does; and so they part. The lady (as we must now call her again) returns home, and a few days later comes Giannetto, with Ansaldo and some other friends. She asks him, of course, for the ring and pretends to be terribly angry when he confesses that he gave it to the lawyer. Giannetto explains the cause by, \\"I swear by all that is sacred, and by your dear self, that I gave the ring to the lawyer who gained our cause\\". To which she replies, \\"And I can swear that you gave the ring to a woman therefore, swear no more\\". But all is explained soon, and Ansaldo marries the young maid-in-waiting who had given Giannetto the hint by which he was able to fulfil the hard conditions imposed upon the wooers and win the \\"Lady of Belmonte\\".

Since 22 September 2014, the U.S. had conducted military operations in Syria, primarily against ISIL forces as part of Operation Inherent Resolve. The primary U.S-backed force in the northeastern part of Syria had been the Syrian Democratic Forces, a group composed predominantly of Kurdish and Arab militiamen. In 2017, backed by the U.S. forces, the SDF captured Raqqa from the Islamic State and has since advanced to the Euphrates River, where a \\"deconfliction line\\" was established through coordination by the governments of the U.S. and Russia. On several occasions, U.S. forces struck Syrian pro- government units operating in the area. In November 2017, the U.S. government made it known that they were expanding their goals in Syria beyond routing ISIL forces, to pressure the Syrian government to make concessions at the Geneva talks.U.S. moves toward open-ended presence in Syria after Islamic State is routed WP, 22 November 2017.

She worked as an executive producer on several films, including She's All That (1999), Frida (2002), and Mean Girls (2004). She was actress Rose McGowan's manager in 1997 when McGowan alleged that she was raped by Harvey Weinstein. After the Harvey Weinstein allegations became public in late 2017, McGowan was highly critical of Messick; and Harvey's lawyer released a private email sent by Messick that contradicted McGowan's claims. The publicity surrounding the scandal led to online cyberbullying directed at her. Messick died by suicide in February 2018. In a public statement, Messick's family said that she supported the Me Too movement and called her loss collateral damage of a \\"feeding frenzy\\", blaming Harvey, Rose, the media, and the public for her death. Career Messick was the daughter of Michael Sobel and actress Laura Nicholson Sobel (1945‚Äì2015). She was the maternal granddaughter of film producer James H. Nicholson and had a brother named Jan. After attending Santa Barbara High School, where she was named homecoming princess, Messick graduated with a degree in communications from the University of Southern California. She began her career at the Gersh Agency and later worked as a junior manager at Somers/Teitelbaum/David. She was director of development at Woods Entertainment from 1994 to 1996, working on films including Scream (1996) and Teaching Mrs. Tingle (1999), both distributed by Dimension Films, a division of Miramax Films. She also helped facilitate Miramax distributing M. Night Shyamalan's Wide Awake (1998). Shyamalan later said that \\"she helped fight for my second film to get made at Miramax. Really made me feel I had a big sister protecting me.\\" In the late 1990s, she worked as a talent manager at Addis-Wechsler & Associates, where her clients included Chloe Sevigny and John Bloom. In November 1997 she was hired as vice-president of development by Miramax Films and tasked with \\"scouting writers and directors and bringing in material to the company.\\" She reported directly to executive vice-president of production Meryl Poster and was hired by Cathy Konrad, who said that she had \\"a keen eye for spotting new talent.\\" At Miramax Messick helped bring She's All That (1999) to the company within a month of her hiring, It eventually grossed $60 million. She worked on such films as Boys and Girls (2000), Frida (2002) and Cinderella Man (2005). She also worked directly with Dimension Films and helped make multipicture deals with screenwriters R. Lee Fleming, Jr., Andrew Lowery and Andrew Miller. In 2000, she was promoted to senior Vice-President of Production. She worked at Miramax until 2003. She later worked as an executive producer for Lorne Michaels, Paramount Pictures and The Weinstein Company. Her film credits include Get Over It (2001), Mean Girls (2004), Hot Rod (2007), Baby Mama (2008), and Masterminds (2016). Messick made a brief foray into television production with the short-lived NBC sitcom Bad Judge (2014‚Äì15). She was married to producer Kevin Messick, with whom she had two children. Weinstein allegations Messick was actress Rose McGowan's talent manager in 1997 at the time when McGowan alleges Harvey Weinstein raped her. In an October 2017 interview with The New York Times, McGowan was highly critical of Messick's lack of support after the incident and the article suggests that Messick's job at Miramax was directly related to the aftermath. On January 30, 2018, Weinstein's attorney released a private email from Messick to Weinstein as a way to defend Weinstein. The email was sent months before the incident became publicly known and Messick's account of the incident was that McGowan told her that she consensually got into a hot tub with Weinstein and later regretted it. Messick's family later said that McGowan \\"never once used the word rape\\" when she told Messick about the incident. McGowan's memoir Brave, also released on January 30, 2018, details the alleged assault and is highly critical of Messick. In a documentary series about McGowan on the E! network, titled Citizen Rose, produced by Bunim/Murray Productions and also airing on January 30, McGowan accused Messick of betrayal and of siding with Weinstein in exchange for her job at Miramax. After Weinstein's lawyers released Messick's email, McGowan claimed that Messick's statements had already been disproven by her former assistant Anne Woodward in The New York Times article. The media and public attention had a negative impact on Messick. The publicity led to online cyberbullying after \\"activists on Twitter named, shamed and identified how Messick could be reached, with one even revealing Messick‚Äôs purposefully obscured LinkedIn profile (she did not use her full name) and encouraging others to reach out to her and let her know what they really thought of her.\\" A Messick family statement stated that she had suffered from bipolar disorder and that a \\"manic episode\\" in 2013 had affected her career. The statement also said: \\"Seeing her name in headlines again and again, as part of one person's attempt to gain more attention for her personal cause, along with Harvey's desperate attempt to vindicate himself, was devastating for her. It broke Jill.\\" Death Messick died by suicide in Los Angeles on February 7, 2018, one day after the third anniversary of her mother's death. The method has not been reported. After that, Messick's family issued a public statement that was critical of the media, Weinstein, and McGowan, as well as \\"our new culture of unlimited information sharing and a willingness to accept statement as fact. The speed of disseminating information has carried mistruths about Jill as a person, which she was unable and unwilling to challenge. She became collateral damage in an already horrific story.\\" Her family defended Messick's decision to not publicly address McGowan's negative statements about her because of \\"fear of undermining the many individuals who came forward in truth. She opted not to add to the feeding frenzy, allowing her name and her reputation to be sullied despite having done nothing wrong.\\" It also asserts that, contrary to McGowan's accusations, Messick (who supported the Me Too movement) \\"was the first person who stood up on Rose's behalf, and alerted her bosses to the horrific experience which Rose suffered\\" despite being an entry-level employee at that time. McGowan paid tribute to Messick on Instagram without addressing her family's accusations. Messick was among the deceased memorialized at the 90th Academy Awards.

The society was established on November 2, 1773 by Melchior Falch in the village of Borgund. Falch and the priest Hans Str√∏m supported the initiative. The founding meeting was also attended by other officials and leading people at Sunnm√∏re, and several others joined later. The society was inspired by the Royal Danish Agricultural Society, and among other things it promoted farmers' awards for useful measures and carried out educational work on improving agriculture and other industries in the district. The society was one of the first of its kind in Norway, and it provided a model for similar associations elsewhere in the country. For example, in 1778 the society awarded prizes of 10 rix-dollars for stone livestock buildings, eight rix- dollars for newly tilled land, six rix-dollars for shooting six adult wolves, and five rix-dollars for potato cultivation. Melchior Falch himself operated a model farm in Borgund. The society stagnated when Falch and Str√∏m left Sunnm√∏re in 1779, but efforts by Andreas Landmark revived the society's activities around 1802. Work in the society came to a complete standstill in 1816 for reasons that are not clear. The society was probably absorbed into the Royal Norwegian Welfare Society (Det Kongelige Selskap for Norges Vel). The Norwegian Welfare Society was established in 1809 with its own district committee for Sunnm√∏re, and this district committee contained the same persons (the provost Peter Daniel Baade, the magistrate Ole Severin Kildal, and the bailiff Andreas Landmark) as the leadership of the agricultural society.

Located in north-central Puerto Rico, to the west of the capital city, San Juan, the Dorado Ground Water Contamination site is located within the Maguayo and Dorado Urbano public water systems, and is the source of drinking water for more than 67,000 people. This site first came under scrutiny by officials in the 1980s and it was officially added to the EPA's Superfund list on September 9, 2016. The EPA is in the process of examining the precise extent and location of this contaminated groundwater plume and, at this time, the contaminants cannot be attributed to any specific source. In the wake of Hurricane Maria, the site has come under increased scrutiny because locals desperate for a source of safe drinking water have been using wells on the superfund site.  Location  The Dorado Ground Water Contamination site is located in the north-central region of Puerto Rico, on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean, north of Toa Alta, east of Vega Alta, and west of Toa Baja. Dorado County is regarded as a tourist destination with golf courses, hotels, and beaches, though many locals would dispute this claim. Contaminated wells from the Dorado Ground Water Contamination Site draw water from the upper aquifer of the North Coast Limestone Aquifer System. This aquifer has historically been the principal source of fresh water for public and industrial use, and is the source of drinking water for more than 67,000 people in the region. The extent and volume of the contamination plum is currently unknown.  Geology  The contaminated plume occupies the upper aquifer of the North Coast Limestone Aquifer System (NCLAS). The NCLAS consists of a sequence of limestone formations that dip northward toward the Atlantic Ocean. In the Dorado area, the NCLAS upper aquifer is composed of the permeable parts of surficial unconsolidated deposits, the Aymam√≥n Limestone, the Aguada Limestone, and the upper permeable parts of the Cibao formation. Groundwater generally flows in a northerly direction toward the coast, with a smaller groundwater flow component east toward the north-flowing R√≠o de la Plata. The freshwater lens in the NCLAS upper aquifer is estimated to be 200 to 300 feet thick. This aquifer exhibits typical karst characteristics, including transmission of groundwater through channel networks near the water table and decreasing permeability with increasing depth below the water table. Figure citation  Contamination  As far back as the 1980s, wells in the Maguayo and Dorado Urbano systems have been tested for a wide range of volatile organic compounds (VOC's), primarily tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and trichloroethylene (TCE). In September 2015, the EPA conducted a thorough evaluation of the wells in Dorado and the results confirmed the continuing presence of VOCs in the some of the wells. The analytical results indicate the presence of bromodichloromethane, chloroform, [1,2-DCE], PCE, and TCE, at concentrations significantly above the background levels. The PCE concentrations in three wells, Maguayo #4, Maguayo #5, and Maguayo #6, exceed the EPA MCL of 5 ¬µg/L. Maguayo #4 and Maguayo #5 are currently inactive but are still considered as viable components of the system. The Maguayo #6 well is currently active and contributing to the blended Maguayo water supply system and as of September 2015, Maguayo #2, and Maguayo #7 are also active, though not contributing to the water supply system. The pollutants PCE and TCE are believed to cause health problems including liver damage and increased risk of cancer. As a part of the response to Hurricane Maria in September, 2017, the EPA has conducted new tests and determined that there are no exceedances of drinking water standards at the Dorado Groundwater Superfund site currently. These finding have been questioned by New York Representative Jerrold Nadler, however, during a congressional hearing into the federal response to the 2017 hurricane season. Congressman Nadler questioned how the well water could be safe to drink just one year after being placed on the EPA's National Priorities List. [CNN] also reports that they have independently verified that VOC concentrations are within an acceptable range for drinking. = Contaminant Source = Since 2008, EPA has made multiple attempts to identify the source(s) of the contamination plume. In 2008, EPA launched the Maguayo Site Discovery Initiative as an effort to identify possible hazardous waste sites in the vicinity of the contaminated wells, but the data collects was unable to clearly connect any of the tested facilities directly to the contamination. Due to the karst nature of the site, the EPA believes that it is unlikely that further sampling will allow the EPA to identify a source of the contamination, thus this additional effort is beyond the scope of further evaluations. See the EPA's initial April, 2016 report for a comprehensive list of the potential sources, and a list of those facilities that have tested positive for chlorinated solvents.  Hurricane Maria  On October 14, 2017, reports from CNN and others began to surface that wells from the Dorado Ground Water Contamination Plant were being used by residents without access to an alternative source for clean, safe drinking water more than three weeks after Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico. The Washington Post reported that the fencing around the superfund site had been torn open, with the ‚ÄúPeligro‚Äù warning sign, hidden beneath debris and dense vegetation. Residents, many who were unaware that the well, Maguayo #4, was at great risk of contamination, as a part of a superfund site. The Post claims that residents, \\"one after another, ...attached a hose to draw water for bathing, washing dishes and, in some cases, drinking... fill(ing) buckets, jugs, (and) soda bottles.\\" This specific well, Maguayo #4, had been listed as \\"inactive with the pump damaged or removed\\" by the EPA's initial April, 2016 report, so it is unclear how these residents had access to the water. Furthermore, CNN has reported that it witnessed workers from the Autoridad de Acueductos y Alcantarillados, the island's water utility authority, distributing water in the wake of the Hurricane. The fact that residents and authorities turned to wells at the Dorado Superfund Site for drinking water is cited as one example by critics who claim that President Trump's response to Hurricane Maria was inadequate.

He was the head of the Sanitary Department and Director of Education in Hong Kong in the 1920s and 1930s. Education and career He was born in London on 11 February 1887 to an affluent household. His father was a hydraulic and sanitary engineer. He was educated at Highgate School in London and Queen's College, Oxford, where he obtained an honours degree in classics and philosophy and played cricket. He also won a blue for soccer. Sayer took the colonial service examinations after graduation and his good results allowed him to opt for the prime postings of India. However, he chose Hong Kong instead and arrived as a cadet on 1 January 1911. Sayer served on various positions and was an acting private secretary to Governor Francis Henry May in 1915. He joined the World War I and was severely injured with the Rifle Brigade in France. As he spoke Cantonese, Hakka and Mandarin, he was transferred to the Chinese Labour Corps until the end of the war. He returned to Hong Kong in 1920 as the head of the Sanitary Department. He gained reputation for his work with the vaccination campaign of 1923‚Äì24 and the cholera outbreak of 1932. However he was also criticised for his primitive and unhygienic methods used for refuse collection. He argued for continuing the practice of collecting by bullock cart and dumping at sea. Soon after he took a year's leave. In 1934, he returned to Hong Kong to take up the position of Director of Education. During his service he was under the pressure of London for an overhaul of the education system and he was seen as incapable to bring the necessary experience. He was almost permanently on leave when he was pressured by the home government committee report of 1937. In 1938, he retired after the collision with the Teachers Training Committee report. In 1937, Sayer published his first famous historical work, Hong Kong, 1841‚Äì1862: Birth, Adolescence and Coming of Age. He wrote the second history, Hong Kong, 1862 to 1919: Years of Discretion with the edition and additional notes by D. M. Emrys Evans, which was published posthumously in 1975. He also translated two books on Chinese poetry in 1951 and 1959. Personal life and family Sayer played cricket throughout his time in Hong Kong in a private team, Sayer's XI for the Hong Kong Cricket Club and civil service teams. He was famous for his batting ability, scoring centuries against the Royal Navy in 1927 and 1931. He also captained the colony team against Shanghai and Malaya in the Interport Series. Sayer married in 1919 and had three sons and two daughters. One of his sons, Guy Sayer, was the chief manager of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation from 1972 to 1977.

Life Moye, an African-American, was born in Poughkeepsie, New York and as a teen the family moved to Hollywood, South Carolina. He attended University of South Carolina and in 2006 suffered severe burns from an arson attack at a house he was staying at. He went on to attend Winthrop University, finishing in 2011. That fall he appeared at Occupy Eugene. Back in Charleston he found and joined the Bah√° º√≠ Faith around 2014 and soon was visible in the news following the shooting of Walter Scott and being known as a Black Lives Matter activist in 2015. After some more work in 2016 Moye became involved in a February 2017 Bree Newsome speaking engagement that drew protestors and counter protestors during which he made a leap crossing police lines to take down an oversized Confederate battle flag that happened to occur during a news broadcast and so was caught on live television. A year later Moye went to New Orleans and while riding a bicycle through the midnight streets on February 6, 2018, he was shot, traveled on some blocks, left his bike and called for help to which police responded and took him to the hospital. However he had lost too much blood and died in the morning. Activism Moye rose to local prominence after the shooting of Walter Scott by North Charleston, South Carolina, police in 2015. Moye arranged a meeting in which Scott's family first viewed eyewitness Feidin Santana's video of the shooting. Also in 2015, Moye met with Bernie Sanders - where Sanders said \\"Let me be very clear. Nobody will fight harder to end institutional racism and to reform our broken criminal justice system.\\" Moye said \\"Bernie's going through his own evolution. Coming from Vermont and being in the space of white privilege that he's enjoyed, he's gonna go through an experience of learning.\\" But Moye's activism goes back at least to 2011 when he was visible at the Occupy Eugene event in October. In 2016, Moye was arrested for disrupting a North Charleston City Council committee meeting while petitioning for a citizens board to review police actions. The city later formed the Citizens Advisory Commission on Community-Police Relations. Moye was called a hero for things he did but he demurred and observed of protest tactics ‚Äúmuch more action, a lot less social media talking and organizing on social media. A lot less getting together at marches and yelling at inanimate objects, and a lot more action and interrupting.‚ÄùA Bree Newsome speaking engagement was set in early February 2017 and drew protestors and counter protestors. In the situation before the leap with the Confederate oversized battle flag waving, he said \\"And I looked at our elders and I saw, like, fear in their eyes. And I saw them back up, almost. That was the moment for me. We're not going to pass this on another generation. Not another generation of people are going to be intimidated by this flag.\\"Moye spoke afterwards about it saying \\"We have been able to experience this kind of oppression and this intimidation because we don't resist it.‚Ä¶ And we learn how to tolerate it and we learn how to normalize it. That's what my impetus was to take down that flag\\" in an interview with MTV News. Both the flag waving protestor and Moye were then in a fundraising situation - the protestor's efforts had stagnated but then rose to $4,000 while Moye's raised $10,000. David Meyer Lindenberg was less impressed with the leap and wrote to suppress the fundraising for Moye. In March 2017, following his leap for justice, a concert was arranged in Charleston, \\"a community festival and multicultural celebration of music, art, food, activism, and community,\\" Jelani Cobb, Professor of Journalism at Columbia University, writing for the New Yorker, called him \\"a complex, vexing, and, to his opponents and to some portion of his admirers, an exasperating figure. He was not, however, insincere, lacking insight, or, as had been apparent to me since that afternoon in the Circular Congregation Church, easily forgettable.\\" Cobb encountered Moye during the taping of the PBS special America after Charleston with Gwen Ifill at which he appeared. Cobb's view was the Ifill did not like Moye's participation from the audience. In April 2017 the Charleston City Paper asked Moye's advice on community organizing: # \\"don't prescribe unless you can describe\\" # \\"build out of our needs\\" # \\"Organizing friend networks and leveraging social media connections\\" # \\"‚Ä¶we don't need more people to raise awareness. We need more people to start working on actually developing solutions and organizing our presence within spaces where decisions are made.\\" # \\"we want to have organizing that centers natives\\" # \\" The centering of women's voices is absolutely critical.\\" # \\"Where you live and the neighborhood association and what's happening in your geographic location, in your neighborhood school, those are the spaces that we need a lot more organizing happening.\\" # \\"community communication across front lines\\" # \\"create platforms that are collaborative\\" # \\"We want to express in physical reality then we want to bring that expression back into virtual reality to reflect on and to have that generate some more energy so we can express it in physical reality. There is a dance there that we're learning how to do ‚Ä¶\\" # \\"paying young people\\" (to canvass, engage) Biography Moye was born in Poughkeepsie, New York. At age 13, he moved to Hollywood, South Carolina. He attended University of South Carolina as a freshman in 2005 where he met Justin Bamberg, who became a lawyer and state lawmaker. Bamberg was the attorney for Scott's family after the shooting. In a case of arson, in June 2006 Moye was one of the victims in the house who suffered severe burns. Moye graduated from Winthrop University with a Masters of Arts degree in May 2011 and then went on to the Occupy Eugene event in October. His experience with the fire was called a near death experience, and later found the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in South Carolina, the second largest religion there. His mother is also a follower of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith but his father was a Nation of Islam Muslim. Moye picked up the Twitter handle @daBlockUp under the name \\"Muhiyidin d'Baha\\" in 2014 and it currently features the Bah√° º√≠ ringstone symbol. In a recorded short talk he speaks of \\"oneness of humankind, equality of men and women, the togetherness of religion and science that just click in a way that's - oh - this is an integrated reality\\" and why he \\"embodied\\" himself as a Bah√° º√≠; he said: \\"Bah√° ºu'll√°h has given me the freedom to consort and be friendly with anybody of any religion of any race from anywhere on this planet because I know the oneness of human kind is a reality.\\" In December 2016 Moye appeared as part of a panel at the College of Charleston about the death of Walter Scott. The coverage of the death of Scott including mention of Moye won the Charleston Post and Courier a Pulitzer in breaking news. =Death and memorialization= In February 2018, Moye took a personal trip to New Orleans, Louisiana. At around 1:30am on , while riding his bike along Bienville Street in the Iberville Projects, Moye was approached by a stranger, knocked off his bike, and shot in the thigh. Moye was rushed to the hospital where he later died of his injuries.* (2 blocks) * (6 blocks) A prayer vigil was held at North Charleston City Hall on February 7 with members of his family. A community memorial service was held on February 10, 2018 by the Denmark Vesey monument also attended by city leaders. A friend said that though he was known for some of his efforts \\"his real work was in the community, especially with children\\" and invited people to Moye's \\"dablockup\\" program of action in the community while others renamed a project for an academy in development as the \\"Muhiyidin d'Baha Leadership Academy\\". Further events were announced for February 14 at Charity Missionary Baptist Church and a funeral at the Royal Missionary Baptist Church for February 15, as well as a traditional African ceremony at McLeod Plantation February 17.The death inspired a review of the hard life of activists and their generally early deaths by a writer in the New York Times. In June a project for a youth academy was advancing in Charleston, SC. There was widespread public speculation that Moye's killing was related to his career as a Black Lives Matter activist (though this has been proven to not be the case). Former State Senator for the Charleston area Robert Ford made a plea on his Facebook page to call to investigate the murder, saying: ‚ÄúAs you are aware, one of our most successful activist in the Black Lives Matter Movement, Muhiyidin Elamin Moye, has been killed. He was shot at night in New Orleans, Louisiana on Tuesday, February 6, 2018. This MUST be a call to arms as Moye was contacted to help organize the Black Lives Movement in New Orleans and this seems to be a Civil Rights Action that should be further investigated by the United States Justice Department.‚Äù Divisive comments in social media have been noted in the Fairfield Mirror student newspaper associated with Fairfield University in Connecticut. On July 25, 2018, New Orleans police arrested Roosevelt Iglus and charged him with second- degree murder after being led to him by a tip. Iglus was on parole related to a case from 2016 to which he had pled guilty. On July 22, 2019, Iglus pled guilty to manslaughter in a plea agreement that saw him sentenced to 17 years in prison for the killing. No motive for the crime was ever suggested or confirmed by Iglus, though police believe that Iglus did not know Moye, and thought him to be someone else whom Iglus wished to harm.Further research References 1985 births 2018 deaths People from Poughkeepsie, New York People from Charleston, South Carolina University of South Carolina alumni Winthrop University alumni Murdered African-American people African- American activists Murdered activists Black Lives Matter people Deaths by firearm in Louisiana People murdered in Louisiana Converts to the Bah√°'√≠ Faith from Islam Former Nation of Islam members African-American Bah√°'√≠s 21st- century Bah√°'√≠s ","title":"Muhiyidin Moye"},{"id":"56537299","text":"Whitney White, known as Naptural85 on YouTube, is a vlogger, blogger, natural hair enthusiast, and entrepreneur.

It has a single thin leaf fused to the flowering stem and up to twenty five small, hairy green flowers with a purple labellum. Description Genoplesium ruppii is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single thin leaf long and fused to the flowering stem with the free part long. Between twelve and twenty five greenish flowers are crowded along a flowering stem long and much taller than the leaf. The flowers are about long and wide and are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is about long, wide and pointed with short glandular hairs on its edges. The lateral sepals are about long, wide and spread apart from each other. The petals are about long, wide and sharply pointed with short coarse hairs on their edges. The labellum is dark purple, broadly egg-shaped, thick and fleshy, about long, wide, with short glandular hairs on its edges. There is a small callus in the centre of the labellum and extending about half way to its tip. Flowering occurs between January and April. Taxonomy and naming Rupp's midge orchid was first formally described in 1927 by Richard Sanders Rogers who gave it the name Prasophyllum ruppii. The type specimen was collected near Paterson by Herman Rupp and the description was published in Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of South Australia. In 2001, David Jones changed the name to Genoplesium ruppii and in 2002 Jones and Mark Clements changed the name again to Corunastylis ruppii.

It was built from 1920. Architects who designed the school's buildings include Arthur Gordon Femister Greenway and Blackburne and Gzell. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 12 June 2015.  History  Wilston State School opened in 1920 in the Brisbane suburb of Wilston (but now within the suburb boundaries of Grange), to serve the growing suburban population in the Wilston-Grange area. Due to suburban development during the interwar period and after World War II, additional buildings were added to serve the school's needs. Wilston State School has a range of standard and purpose-built timber and brick buildings dating from 1920 to the 1950s, set in landscaped grounds. The school has been in continuous operation since establishment and has been a focus for the local community as a place for important social and cultural activities. The provision of state-administered education was important to the colonial governments of Australia. Following the introduction of Queensland's Education Act 1860, which established the Board of General Education and began standardising curriculum, training and facilities, Queensland's public schools grew rapidly.Thom Blake, \\"Educating Queenslanders\\" in Queensland Historical Thematic Framework, 2007 (rev. 2013 by EHP), p 2. Queensland's State Education Act 1875 provided for free, compulsory and secular primary education and established the Department of Public Instruction. This further standardised the provision of education, and despite difficulties, achieved the remarkable feat of bringing basic literacy to most Queensland children by 1900.Greg Logan and Eddie Clarke, State Education in Queensland: a brief history, a report for the Department of Education, Queensland, 1984, p.2. The establishment of schools was considered an essential step in the development of early communities and integral to their success. Locals often donated land and labour for a school's construction and the school community contributed to maintenance and development. Schools became a community focus, a symbol of progress, and a source of pride, with enduring connections formed with past pupils, parents, and teachers. The inclusion of war memorials and community halls reinforced these connections and provided a venue for a wide range of community events in schools across Queensland.Project Services, \\"Wilston State School\\" in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, for Education Queensland, 2008, n.p. To help ensure consistency and economy, the Queensland Government developed standard plans for its school buildings. From the 1860s until the 1960s, Queensland school buildings were predominantly timber-framed, an easy and cost-effective approach that also enabled the government to provide facilities in remote areas. Standard designs were continually refined in response to changing needs and educational philosophy and Queensland school buildings were particularly innovative in climate control, lighting, and ventilation. Standardisation produced distinctly similar schools across Queensland with complexes of typical components.Paul Burmester, Margaret Pullar and Michael Kennedy Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, Part I, November 1996, pp.84, 120-1. European settlement of the area around Wilston State School began when William Wilson, a city merchant, took up 300 acres of land and built a stone house , which he called \\"Wilston\\" after his birthplace in Ireland. The later suburb, located between Newmarket and Windsor, took the name of Wilson's house. During the 19th century, Wilston remained a predominantly rural area.Project Services, \\"Wilston State School\\". Suburban growth intensified with the arrival of the railway at nearby Newmarket in 1897. In 1899 the Ferny Grove railway line was extended to Enoggera and the Town of Windsor, incorporating Wilston, was proclaimed in 1904. The suburb, near the Newmarket saleyards (1877-1931), was at first regarded as an outlying district of Newmarket, and was used for agistment, tanneries, fellmongering, dairying and extractive industries.'Wilston', , accessed March 2015. The train line to Newmarket station had a stop at Wilston, and settlement spread northwards from there to the desirable elevated slopes of Eildon Hill.Project Services, \\"Wilston State School\\". The population of Wilston increased further following establishment of the Grange electric tramway along Days Road in 1928. Lobbying for a new school at Wilston began in 1912. The neighbouring schools of Bowen Bridge (Windsor State School) and Newmarket State School had resisted the establishment of another school, fearing it would decrease resources for existing schools in the area. In 1914, a further effort was made to have a school erected in the district, pointing out that the steep nature of the area was difficult for small children; and crossing the railway and passing cattle saleyards were added dangers. By 1917 two potential sites for a new school had been selected. Coronation Park, a recreation area, was selected after a secret ballot of parents.'Wilston State School', Brisbane Courier, 19 Feb 1918, p.8. Block C, from Primrose Street, 2009 Subsequently, Wilston State School opened on 14 August 1920, comprising one suburban timber school building (Type C/T8) (now known as Block C) on 4 acres of land (1.62ha).Known as Block C in 2015. Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, Part 2, p. 25. The building was centrally positioned on the higher ground at the southern (Primrose Street) end of the site. A newspaper report described the building as timber on brick piers with an asbestos slate roof and ornamental fleches. There were 8 classrooms with verandahs and two teachers rooms on the north side. Particular reference was made to good lighting and ventilation. The concreted area under the building was used as play space, with conveniently placed toilets nearby.'New School Opened - function at Wilston', The Daily Standard, 19 August 1920, p.2. The school had an initial enrolment of 320 pupils, which rose with the progress of the district.'Wilston State School - the Opening Ceremony', Brisbane Courier, 16 August 1920, p.7. The school gained a reputation for success in the arts and music, due largely to the efforts of the first head teacher, Walter Collings. His influence played an important role in the development of the school and its grounds. He is recognised for his public stance in opposing corporal punishment in schools and Wilston was reputedly the first school in Queensland to ban corporal punishment.Wilston State School. Golden Jubilee 1920-1970, Wilston State School, Wilston State School, Brisbane, 1970, n.p. By the late 1920s, the school possessed its own orchestra.'Wilston State School' Brisbane Courier, 12 August 1929, p.29. Reflecting the school's arts focus, in 1923 a bust of William Shakespeare, located in a garden bed on the north side of the 1920 building, was unveiled by the Queensland Governor, Sir Matthew Nathan.'Shakespeare's Charm', Brisbane Courier, 20 August 1923, p.6. Walter Collings, head teacher from 1920 to 1939 Collings also promoted sport. One of the first swimming pools at a state school in Queensland was established at Wilston State School in 1923, located in the southwest corner of the grounds. The school committee raised its ¬£650 cost and undertook preliminary work on the site before its construction by MR Hornibrook.Wilston State School.

In 1915, the Hon Herbert Hardacre, Minister for Public Instruction, regarded swimming as \\"preferable to other physical drill during the hot summer months\\" and that he \\"would like to see a swimming pool in every school ground in Queensland\\".'Wooloowin State School', Brisbane Courier, 8 October 1915, p.10. A year later at the opening of the Wooloowin State School pool, he emphasised the value of swimming to children's physiques.'School Swimming Pool', The Telegraph, 25 September 1916, p.10. However, water safety was also a motivation for the establishment school swimming pools.'Swimming', The Telegraph, 11 December 1922, p.3. A year after the opening of the Wilston State School pool, a long timber dressing shed with a brick base, weatherboard walls and a gable roof was built to the west of the pool and was officially opened in October 1924.'Wilston School Baths', Daily Standard, 20 October 1924, p.9. In August 1929, tennis courts were officially opened by the Minister for Education, Reginald King.'Wilston State School', Brisbane Courier, 12 August 1929, p.29. The provision of outdoor play space was a result of the early and continuing commitment by the Department of Public Instruction to play-based education, particularly in primary school. Trees and gardens were planted as part of beautification of schools. In the 1870s, schools inspector William Boyd was critical of tropical schools and among his recommendations stressed the importance of adding shade trees to playgrounds.Paul Burmester, Margaret Pullar and Michael Kennedy Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, a report for the Department of Education, Part I, Nov 1996, pp.4, 48-9. In addition, Arbor Day celebrations began in Queensland in 1890. Landscape elements were often constructed to standard designs and were intrinsic to Queensland Government education philosophies. Educators believed gardening and Arbor Days instilled in young minds the value of hard work and activity, improved classroom discipline, developed aesthetic tastes, and inspired people to stay on the land. Aesthetically-designed gardens were encouraged by regional inspectors.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, pp.4, 48-9. Following construction of Wilston State School, its grounds were terraced and gardens with bush houses were created. Principal Collings expressed the importance of school gardens in July 1932 at the opening of the latest part of the school's beautification scheme, which had commenced 12 years previously, when he said \\"a beautiful garden was better than the best teacher\\".'Wilston School - beautification scheme', Brisbane Courier, 4 July 1932, p.12. Shade trees inside the school boundary near the buildings on Inglis Street (Fig trees) and Thomas streets (two Camphor Laurels and one Fig tree) were planted prior to 1946. Fig trees around the oval, along the Inglis, Carberry and Thomas streets' boundaries, were planted prior to 1964.Department of Natural Resource and Mines (DNRM), Smartmaps: 1958 aerial QAP768-89(2)p.12 Dec 1960 aerial, QAP1090-381964 Aerial QAP1592-67308 April 1969 aerial QAP1938-1451 July 1972 aerial QAP2467-1373 June 1982 aerial QAP4020-2261991 aerial QAP4951-1231997 aerial.

Attention to improving light and ventilation to achieve optimum classroom conditions culminated in 1920 with the sectional school type, a highset timber structure. This design combined all the best features of previous types and implemented theories of an ideal education environment. It proved very successful and was used unaltered until 1950. It was practical, economical, and satisfied educational requirements and climatic needs. Most importantly, it allowed for the orderly expansion of schools over time. Before the sectional school, solar orientation was not given priority and all school buildings were oriented in relation to the street and property boundaries, often resulting in poor lighting. The sectional school type had only one verandah typically on the northern side, allowing the southern wall, with a maximum number of windows, to be unobstructed. The building was designed so that the blank western wall was removable. As the school grew, the western end wall could be detached and the building extended in sections, hence the name. This led to the construction of long narrow buildings of many classrooms - a distinctive feature of Queensland schools.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, pp. 38-40. Opening of the kindergarten, 1926 In 1926 a sectional school building (Type D/T1)For an explanation of Building Type D/T1 see Burmester, et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, Part 2, p.30. was constructed to the northwest of the 1920 school building as a kindergarten wing (now known as Block A). It contained three standard-size classrooms and one double-size classroom and was intended to accommodate 300 children. Typical of the sectional school type, it was highset with blank end walls, a north-facing verandah, large banks of windows in the southern wall, and a projecting teachers room.'Wilston State School: Opening of New Wing', The Brisbane Courier, 31 May 1926, p.9'Wilston School: New Kindergarten Opened', Daily Standard, 31 May 1926, p.11. The commitment of the school principal, Collings, to the development of music and the arts was the likely motivation behind the construction of a new, multi- purpose classroom and concert hall building that was not a standard Queensland Government type. Plans were prepared by architect AGF Greenaway in 1933.ePlan, Department of Public Works Drawing (DPW) 16065170, \\"Prop Addl. Classrooms\\", 1931. Working for the Department of Public Works at the time, Greenaway, who was born in Ipswich in 1894, had previously worked with Brockwell Gill in Ipswich and the Brisbane City Council, and registered as an architect in 1929.'New Wing Wilston State School', Sunday Mail, 24 September 1933, p. 13Donald Watson and Judith McKay, A Directory of Queensland Architects to 1940.

The Governor of Queensland, Sir Leslie Wilson, opened the new purpose-built building (now known as Block D) on 23 September 1933.'New Wing Wilston State School', Sunday Mail, 24 Sep 1933, p.13. Located to the northeast of the 1920 building, it was more like a church hall than a school building in form, with a porch at the west end, two double classrooms in the body of the building, separated by a partition, and a classroom on a platform at the east end with a teachers room and lobby each side. There were no verandahs. The roof was gabled with a fleche and windows were standard school casements with fanlights. The classrooms were wide with a trussed roof.ePlan, DPW Drawing 16065170, \\"Prop Addl. Classrooms\\", 1931ePlan, DPW Drawing 16065159, \\"Addl. Classrooms\\", 1933. Primrose Street entrance with pergola, 2015 During the 1930s changes and additions to the grounds occurred. Around 1934 new toilets were constructed under the original 1920 building and the 1926 infants wing, and two acres of additional land was acquired from Coronation Park to the north for a sports oval in 1937.'Sell to Government part of Coronation Park', Sunday Mail, 6 November 1932, p. 13Project Services, \\"Wilston State School\\", p.9. Landscaping works, including a terraced lawn, concrete stairs, garden beds and a pergola at the main (Primrose Street) entrance, were undertaken by relief labour in 1932 as part of an ongoing school beautification scheme. This stage included the unveiling of a bust of Captain Cook, the work of James Arthur Watts, in a garden bed next to the pergola on 2 July 1932.Download'Caravanning Around Queensland', The Queenslander, 4 August 1932, pp.26-7. Further landscaping included a concrete retaining wall and balustrade around the parade area north of the 1920 building in 1933.Wilston State School, Wilston State School Diamond Jubilee 1920-1980: Wilston State School: 1980-81, Wilston State School, Brisbane, n.p. In 1935 a set of gates, constructed on the Thomas Street boundary, were funded through community fundraising and a donation from the noted manufacturer and philanthropist, George Marchant, who lived in the vicinity.Helen Gregory, \\"Marchant, George (1857-1941)\\", Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/marchant-george-7481/text13039, published first in hardcopy 1986, accessed online 16 April 2015. These gates consisted of concrete pillars with iron gates and an archway. They were officially opened on 21 September 1935.'New Entrance Gates at Wilston State School', Courier Mail, 23 September 1935, p.15. In the same year, art deco-style balustrading was added to retaining walls north of the infants wing.'New Entrance Gates at Wilston SS', Courier-Mail, 23 September 1935, p.15. For most Brisbane suburbs, the immediate post-World War II period was one of development with the consequent rise in school populations due to the \\"baby boom\\"; as was the case for Wilston State School. After World War II the overriding concern for the Department of Public Instruction was the need to build school buildings as expeditiously and economically as possible. Queensland schools were faced with enormous overcrowding and a lack of resources as the Queensland Government gave education a low priority and provided the department with only a small budget. At the same time, skilled labour was scarce and materials were in short supply.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, p.65, 112. In this immediate post-war period two 1922 Sectional buildings (now known as blocks B and E) were relocated to the site from Kelvin Grove Boys School, to accommodate Wilston State School's growing population.BCC 1946 aerial, <>, accessed March 2015'Paint Experiments', The Telegraph, 23 Feb 1922, p. 2Department of Public Works Annual Report for the year ending 1922 lists \\"additions and repairs\\" at Kelvin Grove as costing ¬£3346 16s. Each contained two classrooms with an L-shaped verandah, and were positioned to the west and east of the 1920 building (Block C).ePlan, DPW Drawing 15487868, \\"Kelvin Grove Primary and Infants State School - block plan\\", 19481951 aerial DNRM Smartmaps, BCC4-39295. In the eastern building (Block E) was extended at either end. The original eastern wall was relocated to the eastern extent of the extension and fabric from the original, western verandah was reused in the extensions. The original hatroom was relocated to the western corner of the new verandah. The extensions had large banks of timber casements in the southern walls, with timber sashes in the verandah walls. A curved pathway running between blocks C and E was repositioned to accommodate the extension.ePlan, DPW Drawing 16065137, \\"Addl. Accommodation\\", 1953. In 1954 another purpose-designed building (now known as Block G), was constructed near the Primrose Street boundary, southeast of the 1920 building. School fund-raising for it had begun in 1941 and by 1953, a plan for a ¬£6250 new Visual Education Centre and Library was published in The Courier Mail. Half of the building cost was funded by the school's fund-raising efforts and half by the Queensland Government.'Must Win State Aid', Sunday Mail, 29 August 1954, p.3'To Quicken Education at Wilston', Courier Mail, 26 August 1953. Designed by Brisbane firm, Blackburne and Gzell Architects, it was a two-storey timber building with a terracotta roof and a two-storey brick entrance porch.ePlan, Blackburne and Gzell Architects Drawing 1659406, \\"Proposed library and hall for Wilston State School\\", 1978. The building was officially opened in 1954 by Queensland Premier, Vince Gair.'Must Win State Aid', Sunday Mail, 29 August 1954, p.3. From the 1950s various alterations and additions occurred and more buildings were added to the southern school grounds. In the period 1951-5, a lowset, single-room classroom (Block F) was constructed to the south of Block E, on a diagonal axis.ePlan, DPW Drawing 11853611, \\"Wilston SS Additions\\", 1956DNRM Smartmaps: 1951 aerial BCC4-392951955 Aerial QAP549-50.

In the 1990s several buildings were refurbished and altered to suit new uses. In 1993, the central wing of the 1920 building (Block C) was refurbished for administration purposes, with some modification to joinery and new partitions inserted. The top level of windows on the south- facing walls were either removed or sheeted over. A new staircase, landing and door were added to the southern wall of the central wing, creating a new main entrance to the building. The internal layout of the former teachers room, which had been extended in 1973, was altered to create offices, a store room and a sick bay.ePlan, Department of Public Works Drawing 10821473, \\"Upgrade Block C for Administration\\", December 1992Wilston State School, Memories: Wilston State School 1920 - 1995, 75th Anniversary, n.p.

Additions and changes to landscape elements have also been made. From the 1950s stone pitched walls were constructed in various locations as retaining walls, including the bank to the north of the 1933 purpose-built building (Block D).

Alterations to pathways and gardens between the 1920 building (Block C) and Primrose Street took place in the 1990s, including the realignment of the main entrance gate and pathway.ePlan, Department of Public Works Drawing 10821426, \\"Site Plan and External Works\\", October 1993. The importance of the school to the local community has been demonstrated by the support given by parents in the development of buildings, the beautification of the grounds, and continuity of attendance, with several generations of local families attending.Project Services, \\"Wilston State School\\". In 2015, the school continues to operate from its original site. It retains standard and purpose-built timber and brick buildings dating from 1920 to the 1950s, set in landscaped grounds. The school is important as a focus for the surrounding community and generations of students from the area have been taught there. Since establishment, it has been a key social focus for the community with the grounds and buildings being the site of many social events.  Description  Site map, 2015 Wilston State School occupies the whole of a 2.84ha block within the hilly terrain of The Grange, a residential suburb of Brisbane. The site is bounded by Primrose Street to the south, Inglis Street to the east, Thomas Street to the west and Carberry Street to the north. The school comprises a large complex of buildings on a sloping site, with the earliest school buildings located on the high ground at the southern end of the site, more recent development in the centre, and playing fields on the low ground at the north end. In addition to the early buildings are entrance gates on the Thomas Street boundary (1935) and a swimming pool (1923) with dressing shed (1924) in the southwest corner. Other site features include concrete busts of historical figures (1923 and 1932), balustrade walls (1933 and 1935), retaining walls (s), stone pitched walls, an east-west driveway, pathways, and established trees and landscaping. The six significant buildings within the school complex are all timber-framed and clad, and orientated on an east-west axis. These buildings are: * Block C - 1920 suburban timber school building * Block A - a 1926 sectional school building * Block D - a 1933 purpose-designed classroom and hall building * Block B - a c1922 sectional school building * Block E, extended c1953 - a c1922 Sectional School Building * Block G - a 1954 former Visual Education Centre and Library. Evidence of early site planning of the school grounds remains, with all significant buildings (except for Block G) positioned symmetrically in relation to Block C, the original 1920 building, which occupies a central position in the southern school grounds. Blocks A and D lie to the northwest and northeast of Block C respectively, positioned in line with each other with a former parade ground in between. Blocks B and E (a matching pair of buildings added to the site in ) are positioned in line with Block C at its west (Block B) and east (Block E) ends. Block B stands close to Block C due to the limited space available between it and the swimming pool in the southwest corner of the grounds, while Block E had sufficient space around it to be extended at either end in . Block G is located to the southeast of Block C and its north-facing main entrance is aligned with the gap between blocks C and E. With the exception of Block G, all of the significant school buildings are weatherboard-clad, highset on either brick or concrete piers, and have corrugated metal-clad roofs. Blocks C, A, B and E are rectangular in plan and have north-facing verandahs; large banks of glazing on the southern elevations to provide maximum natural light to the interiors; and a range of early timber joinery. All buildings have timber floorboards and timber skirtings of a simple profile. In general, eaves, verandah ceilings, and internal walls and ceilings are lined with timber v-jointed (VJ) tongue-and- groove (T&G;) boards, with flat sheeting used for some 1950s classrooms. Blocks C, A, B and the central portion of block E have coved ceilings, exposed metal tie rods and square ceiling ventilation panels (most now enclosed). Elements not of cultural heritage significance include lifts, modern carpet and linoleum floor coverings, inserted partitions, kitchenettes, modern benches and storage cupboards, and aluminium windows. = 1920 Suburban Timber School building (Block C) = Projecting teachers'room, Block C, 2015 Block C is a large, symmetrically-arranged block comprising a central wing (formerly 4 classrooms, now used as offices), two end wings (containing 2 classrooms each), and a projecting teachers room (extended ) on the north side of the central wing. The wings are connected by continuous verandahs along the northern sides, sections of which are enclosed. The wings have gambrel roofs and the teachers room has a gable roof. Four sets of stairs and a modern lift provide access to the verandahs and a recent covered staircase is attached to the south side of the central wing. Banks of windows in the south walls of all wings have casements in the bottom row and horizontally centre-pivoting windows above. The east and west wings retain a top row of fanlights that are top-hinged and set within inclined frames (sheeted over on the exterior). Each end wall has three small, high, centre-pivoting windows. The teachers' room has modern aluminium casement windows in timber framing with early square timber fanlights above, shaded by timber-framed, skillion-roofed hoods on the north elevation. The central wing verandah has a two-rail slat balustrade, curved timber arches between verandah posts, a raked ceiling and a single skin verandah wall. Early timber joinery includes tall, horizontally centre- pivoting fanlights over doorways and later sash windows with fanlights. Verandahs to the east and west wings have been partially enclosed by weatherboards. The interiors are lined and large openings have been cut into the verandah walls. Classrooms in the east and west wings are separated by original timber partitions with fixed glazing, and walls have picture rails. Multiple new partitions have been added to the central wing but original partitions survive under modern linings. All partitions in the central wing have high-level fixed glazing. The teachers' room has a flat ceiling and partitions have been relocated. The understorey has a concrete slab floor and is partially enclosed by timber batten screens and brick infill walls. The piers are glazed brown bricks with rounded edges. The understorey accommodates several toilet blocks dating from the 1930s and 1950s. These have brick external walls and timber partitions of vertical timber boards. Beneath the west wing a large room and two store rooms have been constructed at different periods from various materials, including wide vertical timber boards. Several long timber benches are located beneath the central wing. = 1926 sectional school building (Block A) = Block A is a long building with a projecting teachers room attached to the verandah. It has a gable roof with vertical batten gable infill, and raked eaves. The east and west walls are windowless. Access is via two timber staircases to the verandah. The verandah has a timber, two-rail slat balustrade, a raked ceiling and a single skin verandah wall. Former hat room enclosures of single-skin weatherboard walls survive at either end, and bag hooks are attached to the verandah wall. The building retains much of its original timber joinery. The south wall has five banks of casement windows with fanlights. The projecting teachers' room has pairs of casement windows with fanlights above, protected by skillion-roofed hoods. The verandah wall has five sets of double doors with fanlights alternated with five pairs of three-light sash windows with fanlights. The interior comprises two large classrooms and one smaller classroom. Two single-skin partition walls survive, and the location of a removed partition is evident in the ceiling of the western room. The former teachers room has been enlarged by the removal of its southern wall to incorporate a section of enclosed verandah. The understorey has a concrete slab floor and is partially enclosed by timber batten screens and brick infill walls. The piers are glazed brown bricks with rounded edges. A 1930s/50s toilet block with brick external walls and timber dividing partitions is at the eastern end and the western end has been enclosed for store rooms. = 1933 purpose-designed former classroom and hall building (Block D) = Former hall and classrooms, 2015 The 1933 purpose- designed former classroom and hall building ('Block D') stands on brick stumps and walls. The building is rectangular in plan, with a projecting, central porch on the western side and projecting stair landings at the eastern end of the north and south sides; the building and western porch have gable roofs with vertically-battened timber gable-ends. A prominent fleche and spaced eaves-cladding along the northern and southern elevations ventilate the roof space. Most windows are timber-framed casements with (now fixed) fanlights, sheltered by corrugated metal hoods with timber brackets. There are four sets of timber stairs; two to the eastern end projections, and two to the west. The interior comprises a large central space; with an enclosed western porch; and an eastern raised stage and kitchenette (formerly one space) flanked to the north and the south by hallways and former teachers rooms. Most walls and ceilings are lined with T&G; VJ timber boards; stud framing is exposed in sections of the teacher's rooms. Bulkhead partitions in the central space are in the locations where original folding partitions have been removed (one in the centre of the space and one at the stage opening). Beams in this space are expressed and clad in VJ timber boards. Ceiling vents remain in their original positions and high-level, timber picture-rails run around the perimeter of the space. Original timber panelled doors with fanlights provide access to the teachers rooms and hallways. The understorey has rounded brick stumps, brick walls, and a concrete slab floor. There is an early timber door to the space below the western porch, and early windows include timber-framed sashes. = sectional school building (Block B) (relocated ) = Block B has an L-shaped verandah along the north and east sides (enclosed on the east side), a gable roof with vertical batten gable infill, and raked eaves. The building stands on concrete piers and the understory is enclosed with timber batten screens. Access is via a staircase to the north verandah and a recently installed lift and platform connecting the verandah to the pool area to the west. The verandah has a timber, two-rail dowel balustrade, a raked ceiling and a single skin verandah wall with bag hooks. Fabric from a former hat room located in the northeast corner of the verandah has been incorporated into the verandah enclosure. Early windows include timber sashes with fanlights in the verandah wall, and two large banks of timber-framed windows on the south wall, consisting of casements on the bottom row, horizontally centre-pivoting windows in the middle and fanlights at the top. Doors in the verandah wall each have two tall, horizontally centre-pivoting fanlights. A double door at the western end of the verandah is the only early door and retains its original handle. The interior comprises two classrooms divided by a single- skin partition, and the enclosed verandah contains a modern kitchen area and office. = sectional school Building (Block E), extended = The sectional school building with 1953 extensions to the east and west ends ('Block E') stands on concrete and steel stumps. It has gable roof with battened gable- infills. Windows in the south wall are associated with the different construction periods; banks of tall, timber-framed, sash and horizontally centre-pivoting windows with fanlights to the central 1922 section; and banks of dual, timber-framed casement windows with awning fanlights to the 1953 end sections. The verandah has a raked ceiling, single skin verandah wall and bag- racks between square timber posts. Part of the ceiling is flat over the 1953 verandahs. A line in the ceiling lining at the western end marks the position of the original verandah roofline. The west end of the verandah has a hat room enclosure with exposed stud framing (repositioned from the 1922 verandah), and a small section of early two-rail dowel balustrade is retained at the eastern end. Verandah windows are double-hung with timber sashes and awning fanlights. Timber low-waisted doors with early hardware are retained. Doors to the 1922 section have tall, centre-pivoting fanlights, while doors to the extensions have awning fanlights. The interior is divided into three classrooms, with the extent of the western classroom overlapping both the 1953 and 1922 sections. Although openings have been cut into original walls, the early layout is readable. The walls and ceilings of the 1953 sections are lined with flat sheeting with square cover-strips to the walls and curved cover strips to the ceilings. The understorey has a concrete slab floor and a modern enclosure at the southwest end. Remnants of the original, VJ timber verandah lining are attached to a notched bearer, indicating the western extent of the 1922 building. The joists supporting the 1922 section are narrower than those of the extensions. = 1954 former Visual Education Centre and Library (Block G) = Former library, 2015 The 1954 former Visual Education Centre and Library ('Block G') is a purposed-designed, two-storey, chamferboard-clad structure, with a facebrick projecting porch and verandah on the northern side. It has a terracotta-tiled hip roof with flat-sheet eaves linings and ventilated soffits. The primary entrance to the building is through 5-light French doors within the porch, with secondary entrances from the northern verandah, western staircase and southern patio. Windows are generally timber-framed awnings and there are double-hung windows with timber sashes at the upper level of the porch projection. The porch entryway is flanked by circular concrete columns and low, brick planter boxes. The verandah has a terracotta-tiled hip roof, circular concrete columns, a concrete slab floor and a ceiling lined in flat sheeting. The interior layout of the building is highly intact. The ground floor comprises a foyer with store rooms and a main staircase to the east; and a hall, stage with store rooms, and back-of-house staircase to the west. The upper floor has a singular open space (former library), with a small service room at the western end and a former office space within the northern porch projection. Walls and ceilings of both levels are lined with flat sheeting. The timber handrail of the main staircase is of a geometric design and early 5-light timber French doors between the foyer and hall are retained. Beams expressed within the hall are lined with flat sheeting. = 1923 Swimming Pool and 1924 Dressing Shed = In the southwest corner of the site is a rectangular, in-ground, concrete swimming pool with a timber-framed, weatherboard-clad dressing shed along the west side. The shed stands on a low brick plinth, has a corrugated metal-clad gable roof with circular roof vents, and decorative ridge-caps at the gable-ends. The primary entrance is in the centre of the eastern elevation, with secondary entrances at the ends. High- level louvred windows run the length of the eastern elevation and a long, high-level window is located in the southern wall. Louvered vents are spaced along the western and eastern elevations. Early tiered, timber seating is attached to the eastern side of the shed. = Grounds and trees = Gates at Thomas Street, 2015 The grounds are well established with many mature trees, including a variety of fig and other shade trees along the Inglis, Carberry and Thomas street boundaries. The terraced nature of the sloping site provides opportunities for views of the surrounding area to be obtained from within the school grounds and the school buildings. Stone pitched walls are in various locations around the site - to the west of Block E; to the north and east of the swimming pool; and to the south of Block C. Gardens at the Primrose Street entrance provide an attractive setting for the school, and are an important connection between Block C and the street. Included in this area are pathways, concrete busts of William Shakespeare and Captain James Cook, established garden beds, a timber pergola structure and lawn areas. Other elements within the grounds are primarily arranged on two axes: an east-west axis from Inglis Street to Thomas Street (north of Block C); and a north-south axis on the western side of the site (in line with the centre of Block A). The east-west axis comprises a driveway beginning at the decorative, wrought-iron Thomas Street gates. The gates stand between rendered concrete piers and have an archway featuring \\"WILSTON STATE SCHOOL\\" lettering welded to iron latticework. Emphasising the east-west axis is a concrete balustrade (1933) that tops the retaining walls, forming the south and west edges of the former parade ground (north of Block C). The balustrade, which steps with the contours of the terrain, has large square piers and decorative concrete balusters. Rounded stairs, located in a break within the balustrade, are aligned with the centre of Block C. A timber bell tower with a gable roof and decorative timberwork is located at the east end of Block A and houses an early school bell. Sets of low, s concrete steps are located along the south edge of the driveway, with one set leading to the pool and others on the north side of Block C. The north-south axis links Block A with the northern oval. It is defined primarily by a footpath that begins at a set of curved, concrete stairs with low edge walls at an intersection with an Art Deco-style balustrade (1935). This balustrade has concrete piers linked by tubular metal handrails and stands on an ash-brick retaining wall that wraps around the southern and western edges of a lower playground. The axis pathway continues north to a second set of concrete stairs with low edge walls, providing access to the oval. The generous oval and its established shade trees enhance the school's prominence in its location, provide a picturesque setting for the school and generate a strong sense of place. The streetscape of the area is beautified by mature perimeter trees; terraced embankments; and the provision of ornamental points of interest, including entrance gates and busts of historical figures.  Heritage listing  Wilston State School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 12 June 2015 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Wilston State School (established in 1920) is important in demonstrating the evolution of state education and its associated architecture in Queensland. The place retains excellent and representative examples of standard government designed school buildings that were architectural responses to prevailing government educational philosophies. The suburban timber school building (1920) represents the culmination of years of experimentation by the Department of Public Works (DPW) with light, classroom size and elevation. Three sectional school buildings (, , 1926) demonstrate the evolution of DPW timber school designs to provide equally for educational and climatic needs. Two purpose-built school buildings (1933, 1954) demonstrate a broadening of the curriculum at some schools to incorporate music and the Arts. An early swimming pool (1923) and dressing shed (1924) reflect the growing popularity of children learning to swim for health and safety reasons. The large school site, with mature trees and landscaping features in a large suburban setting, demonstrates the importance of play and aesthetics in the education of children. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Wilston State School is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of Queensland state schools with their later modifications. These include: timber-framed teaching buildings constructed to standard designs by the Queensland Government, and generous, landscaped sites with mature shade trees, assembly/play areas and sporting facilities. The school is a good, intact example of a large suburban school complex, comprising a range of standard and purpose-built timber buildings dating from 1920 to the 1950s, and including non-standard features such as a swimming pool and dressing shed (1923, 1924), entrance gates (1935), bell tower (pre-1939), and busts of historical figures (1923, 1932). The large Suburban Timber School (Block C, 1920) is a good, intact example of its type, with its symmetrical plan of three wings, highset form with play space, toilet blocks and bench seating beneath, gambrel roofs, continuous northern verandahs, large banks of south-facing windows, projecting teacher's room, single-skin verandah walls, early joinery, and internal features such as glazed classroom partitions. Three sectional school buildings (Block B, ; Block E, with extensions; and Block A, 1926) are good examples of their type and Block A is very intact. Characteristics include their highset form with play space beneath, gable roofs, blank end walls, northern verandahs, large banks of south-facing windows, projecting teacher's room (Block A), hat room enclosures, single-skin verandah walls, and early joinery and internal linings. The purpose-built buildings (Block D, 1933, hall and classroom building; and Block G, 1954, hall and library building) are good examples of individually-designed state school buildings constructed in regions with large urban populations to meet the specific needs of the school. Designed to accommodate multiple functions, both buildings remain largely intact. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Wilston State School is important for its aesthetic significance as a well-composed complex of buildings unified by their consistent form, scale, materials and orientation. The original symmetrical layout of these buildings remains intact and demonstrates a continuation of site planning ideals initiated by the siting of the first building in a prominent, central position at the top of the sloping grounds. The school's setting is beautified by mature trees and formal landscaping elements such as axial pathways, retaining and balustrade walls, stairs, gardens, and ornamental points of interest, such as entrance gates and busts of historical figures. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Schools have always played an important part in Queensland communities. They typically retain significant and enduring connections with former pupils, parents, and teachers; provide a venue for social interaction and volunteer work; and are a source of pride, symbolising local progress and aspirations. Wilston State School has a strong and ongoing association with the surrounding community. It was established in 1920 through the fundraising efforts of the local community and generations of children have been educated there. The place is important for its contribution to the educational development of its suburban district and is a prominent community focal point and gathering place for social and commemorative events with widespread community support.

He served the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG) as an overseas missionary in India. The inhabitants of Nazareth, a small town in Tamil Nadu, called him the \\"Father of Nazareth\\" and Margoschis Aiyar. Aiyar means clergyman in the native language. Reverend Margoschis was responsible for the development of the small town of Nazareth, which is situated at the southern part of Tamil Nadu, India. Early life Arthur Margoschis was born in the village of Leamington in England on 24 December 1852. His parents were Thomas David Samuel Margoschis and Mary Anne Margoschis. Arthur Margoschis was the youngest of eight children. Arthur's father was a polish jew and was baptized into the Church of England prior to his marriage. Arthur's father died in 1872. Margoschis was brought to India by Robert Caldwell who at that time was ministering in Idaiyankudi of Tirunelveli District in Tamil Nadu. An adherent of Oxford Movement, Arthur Margoschis, a bachelor, gave up medical school when Caldwell recruited him in London in 1875 for the Nazareth Mission, Tinnevelly. This happened when Arthur Margoschis was in his final year at St Augustine's College, Canterbury. His friends and relatives asked him not to be in a hurry and to complete his final year studies. He answered them that \\"this is not a job that I can do according to my own convenience\\". He started immediately for India. Margoschis reached Madras, India at the age of 22 in the year 1875 and then he stayed with Caldwell for some time at Edeyengoody. Arthur Margoschis came to Nazareth in the month of December 1876 after studying and passing a Tamil examination at Edeyengoody. He was ordained Deacon on 25 March 1877 at St. George's Cathedral, Madras and a priest by 1880. Arthur Margoschis was the younger brother of John Thomas Margoschis who was one of the earliest principals of the SPG College (1868-73), Trichinopoly, which was established in 1864. Spiritual life St. John's church in Nazareth, Tamil Nadu was renovated during the period of Margoschis. The back portion of the church was extended. In 2003, the church was renamed as St. John's cathedral, the cathedral church of the Thoothukudi - Nazareth Diocese. 90% of Nazareth's population are Christians. At the time of Margoschis, churches were also built in the nearby villages of Pillaiyanmanai, Thailapuram, and Udaiyarkulam. Margoschis believed that the natives should not be influenced by wealth or money. Margoschis wrote in 1888: His perception on missionary work was independent and also perseverant. He set an example for all missionaries as well as those who call themselves Christians. He stated The Bishop of Madras made him one of the honor canons of Madras Diocese, praising his devotion and knowledge. As a Christian town, Nazareth celebrates Christmas in a large scale. Native Nazarenians come together to celebrate Christmas with a fireworks display, lighting the streets and singing Christmas carols at the church. The celebration attracts many former residents each year. Work in Nazareth Before the arrival of Arthur Margoschis at Nazareth, Rev. Augustus Frederick Caemmerer and his wife Ann Caemmerer have also made their contributions to this small village. In 1843, Ann Caemmerer started a Girls High School called St. Johns Girls High School, at Nazareth. She is the daughter of Rev. Charles Mead, a LMS Missionary to Travancore. Later, In the year 1876, Rev. Margoschis was made superintendent of this school. Much before to this Ann Caemmerer's school, Rev. James Hough, also Chaplain of the East India Company, at Palamcottah, started a girls school at Nazareth in the year 1819, and it was closed due to financial constraints. St. John‚Äôs Girls‚Äô High School at Nazareth, is considered as the first Girls High School in South India. Reverend Margoschis served as a Medical Officer in charge of the Nazareth Dispensary and Hospital. He was Doctor and a Surgeon. For two hours everyday, Margoschis attended the Hospital and prescribed for his patients. A fee of one penny was charged for the medicine and advice. In this way, he also served the S.P.G Medical Mission from the year 1876. He continued the work of Rev. J. M. Strachan, M.D, Edinburgh University, who opened a regular Medical Mission at Nazareth, in the year 1870. Rev. Margoschis named this hospital as St. Luke's Hospital. Margoschis contributed vastly to the vital infrastructure and livelihood of the people at Nazareth. He provided Educational institutions, Orphanage, Thrift Fund society, Teachers Training School for girls in the year 1887, Art Industrial School in the year 1878, Theological Seminary, Railway Station, Spinning Mill, Telegraph facility, Roads and other vital infrastructures to the people of Nazareth. It is because of him, the railway line connecting Tiruchendur and Tirunelveli was laid through Nazareth. In the year 1877, there was a severe famine. Thousands of people died and consequently a large number of children became orphans. Consequent to this, in the year 1878, he started an orphanage, which later became \\"Art and Industrial School\\". Rev. Margoschis was supported by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (Dursley Branch) and the Indian Famine Orphan Fund. Due to the presence Arthur Margoschis at Nazareth, incidence such as thievery, banditry and other lawlessness were reduced at Nazareth, and also in the adjoining villages of Vazhaiyadi and Pillaiyanmanai. Thieves were afraid of Arthur Margoschis's influence at the police and judicial departments of the British Government. Non-Christians also liked Arthur Margoschis. At the Nazareth Dispensary, about one-third of the patients treated are Non-Christians. Hindu boys and girls studied at Nazareth schools. There was a time when Margoschis was travelling to Madras, people of Nazareth were worried if Margoschis could be transferred to Madras. But Margoschis was not transferred. So the people of Nazareth were overjoyed at his return. On his way back to Nazareth, at Palamcottah, several representatives of the congregation greeted Margoschis. At Alvar Thirunagari, Hindus regardless of caste met Margoschis to do him honor with torches and tom-toms, and by bringing temple elephant decorated with howdas. A procession was held. Later, the people of Kadaiyanodai received him in a similar way. As they neared Nazareth, the people of Nazareth joined the procession, with fireworks, torches, and amidst the hurrahs and shouts of the people Margoschis reached Nazareth. On his return, Nazareth was beautifully decorated, and the lamps were kept burning in the streets whole night. Madras University conferred on Margoschis the title, \\"Kaisar-i-Hind\\" in the year 1901 for his public service, a medal was given by the Viceroy of India. Later in the year 1902, the people of Nazareth were dying of natural calamities such a heavy rain, and cholera. Reverend Margoschis appeared to be a man of short stature with a small beard went round the village on his horseback doing relief work. Rev Margoschis helped those who lost their houses and their belongings. In the year 1904, Archbishop of Brisbane, in his article \\"The East & West\\" praised Margoschis as \\"A remarkable instance of the work of a solitary unmarried missionary is to be found in Nazareth\\" in the medical, industrial, educational and evangelical labour being organised and to a large extent created by Canon Marg√∂schis Conflict with Robert Caldwell and Other Fellow Missionaries On appointment to the Nazareth mission, Margoschis was soon at dispute with some of his missionary colleagues, in particular with Sharrock and Vickers. They complained that Margoschis make slanderous statements about those with whom he disagreed. At some instances Robert Caldwell had to intervene and settle these disputes On the use of caste titles, Margoschis disagreed with Sharrock, he viewed the caste names as mere honorifics, and the caste names no longer has religious significance. Margoschis was not bothered about a Christian using a caste title. But Sharrock indicated that some untouchable caste community never support the use of caste titles. Margoschis hoped that missionaries could convert caste with true principles of political economy, social science, and morality. Margoschis said that many rules and observances of caste have a purely social aspect and is quite easy to conceive a state of society in which religious view of caste never obtruded. In 1849, Rev. Robert Caldwell had published his influential pamphlet, The Tinnevelly Shanars. The people who belonged to the shanar caste felt that Bishop Caldwell has depicted them in a bad image. Later, after the arrival of Rev. Margoschis, Y. Gnanamutthoo Nadar, a native of Nazareth, Tamil Nadu, and a Shanar Christian clerk in Tirunelveli courts, protested this publication. Hence Robert Caldwell suspected Rev. Margoschis, who was working at Nazareth at that time, to be behind this protest. Furthermore, Arthur Margoschis founded a Middle school (which has now become Margoschis Higher Secondary School, named after him) for boys in 1882 in the name \\"Anglo ‚Äì Vernacular School\\". Notably, In the year 1885, this school was awarded \\"The Best School\\" title by the Presidency of Madras. This school was upgraded to the status of a high school in 1889 by the efforts of Margoschis. Bishop Caldwell, who had already started a high school at Sawyerpuram in 1862, considered the high school started by Margoschis, a rival school. Besides, the Madras Diocesan Committee of the S.P.G. had given permission to Margoschis to start the school, ignoring Caldwell's protest and opposition. But Caldwell was stubborn and he managed to get the school closed in 1892, leaving behind the Middle School for boys. In an unusual untoward incident at the church, A. N. Sattampillai, a catechist and teacher with the SPG mission was suspended by Rev. Caemmerer, on the grounds that he did not marry a girl which the Reverend has chosen for him. On this incidence, Rev. Margoschis in his writing stated Death Arthur Margoschis was severely handicapped by chronic asthma. After 31 years of service at Nazareth, Margoschis died on 27 April 1908. Arthur Margoschis was buried inside the St. John's Church, Nazareth premises. The people of Nazareth commemorated the 100th Death centenary of Canon Arthur Margoschis at Nazareth from 23 April to 27 April, in the year 2008.

The mine is located approximately 3 miles south of the California‚ÄìOregon border in the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest. It is within the Siskiyou Mountain range, and sits near a summit at about 4,800 feet above sea level. The underground mining excavations span over 2 miles, and it is one of the largest mining operations to have existed in the region.  Background  The Blue Ledge Mine was discovered in 1898 by three miners that were panning for gold in Joe Creek. Mining operations began in 1905 when demand for copper was increased during World War I. The mine produced 9,000 tons of high-grade ore between 1917‚Äì1920. The high- grade sulfide ore was hand sorted at the mine and taken by tram to the bottom of the mountain. It was then taken by wagon to Rogue Valley and shipped to Tacoma, Washington for smelting. After about a decade of inactivity, the mine produced an additional 2,600 tons of ore in 1930, and then production ceased permanently.  Mining waste and contamination  While the Blue Ledge Mine was in production it had a waste-to-ore ration of 6USDA, and contains an estimated >70,000 tons of waste rock lying on steep hillsides and narrow drainage pathways. The waste rock is distributed in 4 discreet piles, with the deepest pile estimated at 30 feet deep. Mines that exploit mineralized sulfide deposits release sulfuric acid and dissolved metals in a process called acid mine drainage (AMD). The waste rock and sulfide deposits provide a continuous source of AMD that can be harmful to the biological organisms in the surrounding area, including humans. AMD is formed by weathering that oxidizes sulfur minerals to sulfate and acid, and this process is exacerbated by microbes that oxidize reduced minerals. The production of acid, including sulfuric acid, causes metals to leach from waste rock into water and has contaminated nearby Joe Creek with cadmium, copper, lead, arsenic and zinc at levels that are toxic to aquatic life. Joe Creek is unable to contain any self-sustaining populations of fish due to the mining waste. The waste at Blue Ledge is particularly hazardous because it is mainly composed of small particles, which have greatly increased surface area when compared to large rocks, and therefore a high rate of metal leaching.  Waste removal  In 2006, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) authorized the use of $484,302 in \\"total response costs to mitigate threats to human health and the environment posed by the presence of hazardous mine wastes at the Blue Ledge Mine Site...\\". The high levels of contamination deemed the site eligible for Time-Critical Removal Action (TCRA) which was carried out by the EPA. The goals for short-term mitigation detailed in the TCRA included relocating waste rock from major drainage channels, creating an open limestone drainage channel, and building a log dam to retain waste rock. After those projects were completed, long-term solutions, termed Non-Time Critical Removal Action (NTCRA), were put in place. The long-term mitigation included reconditioning haul roads, constructing a permanent waste repository, consolidating waste rock from the four waste rock piles, reclaiming the site as a wildlife habitat, and capping the repository. The long-term storage repository was constructed by the contractor Engineering/Remediation Resources Group in 2010. It is located below the surface at the Blue Ledge Mine. It was lined with high-density polyethylene, which was covered with gravel for drainage, and a clean soil cushion to prevent punctures. After placing all waste rock in the repository, it was covered with soil, gravel, a linear low-density polyethylene cover, and an additional 3 feet of cover soil.

Grid  Nemo is available in various configurations. Global configurations use ORCA tripolar grids, which allow the entire oceanic domain to be covered without singularity points. In fact, the grid formed by the meridians and the parallels has two singularities: the North Pole and the South Pole. Near these two points the mesh size tends to zero, making the use of modeling equations problematic. To overcome the problem, the poles of the ORCA grids are positioned on the terrestrial sphere in such a way as to be located on continents. Since the South Pole is located on the Antarctic continent, a modification of the standard grid is not required, while the North Pole, which is located in the Arctic Ocean, is replaced by two points located one in North America and the other in Siberia. The ORCA grid is available in different horizontal resolutions ranging from about 2 degrees to 1/12 degree.

Co-distributed by Reliance Entertainment, the film stars Hrithik Roshan as Anand, with Mrunal Thakur, Virendra Saxena, Pankaj Tripathi, Aditya Srivastava and Amit Sadh in lead roles. Super 30 was Phantom Film's last production. Principal photography began in February 2018 and the film was extensively shot in Ramnagar Fort and Sambhar Lake Town which was shown as Kota, Rajasthan. Super 30 was theatrically released in India on 12 July 2019 and received positive to mixed reviews, but with some praise for the storyline and Roshan's performance. With worldwide earnings of , the film emerged as one of the highest grossing Bollywood film of 2019. Plot Anand Kumar is a lower-class student who has a passion in studies and is good at it. At a local competition felicitation, the local minister, Shriram Singh, proud of him, promises for help whenever needed. Anand frequently goes to Banaras Hindu University's library to solve a foreign Math journal. One day, the manager finally catches him, and says that he has no right to read there. One staff member suggests him to get his article published in this journal and earn a free lifetime subscription to it. Anand goes to the post-office, where his father Rajendra works as the head, and posts a letter regarding the solution to a difficult Math problem that no one has been able to solve yet. He then gets featured in the journal for solving the problem, and gets a letter from Professor Richard of the University of Cambridge to join a program there. But Anand needs money to travel. He and Rajendra go to Shriram but he denies any promise. They both further try to collect money but remain helpless, and get depressed. One day, Rajendra dies of a heart attack. Anand refuses to go to Cambridge due to his father's death and financial condition. He then sells papads in the city. One day, he meets Lallan Singh, an assistant of the local minister. Lallan takes Anand as a teacher in his coaching centre, Excellence Coaching Centre. There, Anand sees the plight of a boy who had to leave due to poverty. He thinks that these poor kids also have a right to study. Hence, he leaves Excellence and starts a separate tuition for poor kids, in which he enrolls 30 kids at a time. He teaches them to learn everything practically and have the concepts cleared in an easy and fun way. All this enrages Lallan, whose centre is facing criticism for not retaining Anand. In course of the tuition, Anand gets immense help from his brother Pranav and his mother. Lallan and Shriram plan to have Anand killed so that his kids won't be entering IIT. Anand is hurt brutally by two of Lallan's henchmen, and is hospitalised, on the verge of death. He tells his students to then use their knowledge to defeat the goons sent by Shriram, while he is being treated. The students, in unity, use their knowledge and defeat the goons and Anand is treated successfully. The students take the IIT exam and all 30 students pass successfully.

Reception = Critical response = The film received mixed reviews from critics. Sreeparna Sengupta of The Times of India gave the film three and a half stars out of five, and praised Hrithik Roshan, Pankaj Tripathi, Aditya Srivastava and cinematography of Anay Goswami. She felt that Super 30 conveyed the message that though education is the privilege of people with good economic background, if given the level field others too can shine equally. Concluding, she wrote \\"While the narrative does have its flaws, Super 30 is a human drama and the story of a teacher who triumphs over the many challenges that life throws at him, to set an example for the world to see. Just for that it‚Äôs worth a watch.\\" Writing for the NDTV Saibal Chatterjee, rated it with two stars out of five and felt that erratic screenplay of Super 30 had 'skimmed the surface of a massive mound of tangled issues', and that Hrithik Roshan was miscast as Anand Kumar. He opined that the major problem with the film was telling a true story, which was not convincing. He concluded the review as, \\"The idea to bronze up Hrithik Roshan so that he can impersonate Anand Kumar is anything but super: it is a formula that equals zero.\\" Samrudhi Ghosh of India Today rated it with two and a half stars out of five, but praised the performances of Pankaj Tripathi and Aditya Srivastava. Ghosh felt the film was lengthy and had aroused the dramatics without need, saying \\"Under the guidance of math wizard Anand Kumar, his Super 30 turned out to be miracles. Under the guidance of Vikas Bahl, Hrithik Roshan's Super 30 is far from one.\\" Priyanka Sinha Jha of CNN-News18, disagreeing with Ghosh praises Roshan and ensemble of Pankaj Tripathi, Virendra Saxena, Nandish Sandhu and Aditya Srivastav for their performances. She feels that Roshan has given an admirable performance. Agreeing with Sengupta she opines that education is a means to a better life, but is a privilege in itself, and that is what the film questions and challenges. She rates the film with three stars out of five, and concludes, \\"After all, as the famous saying goes‚Äî‚ÄúNot all superheroes wear capes.‚Äù Super 30 is the story of one such..\\" Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave two stars out of five and termed the film 'way less than super', she opined that if handled in right way, it would have been a 'rousing, goosebumps-inducing, cheer-athon.' She summarised by stating, \\"Yes, the real-life story is inspiring. But the telling of it is a drag. The film has its moments, which belong mostly to its young people: the kids are all right.\\" =Box office= Super 30 collected 11.83 crore from India, and 6.18 crore from overseas on the opening day. Next day (Saturday) showing upward trend the film colllected 18.19 crore from India, and 5.46 crore from overseas. The film grossed 75.08 crore in the opening weekend, and 112.65 crore in the opening week worldwide. , with gross of 172.84 crore from India and 36.09 crore from overseas, the film has grossed 208.93 crore worldwide.

A related concept is convexification ‚Äì converting a non-convex function to a convex function. It is especially important in economics and mathematical optimization.  Concavification of a quasiconcave function by monotone transformation  An important special case of concavification is where the original function is a quasiconcave function. It is known that: * Every concave function is quasiconcave, but the opposite is not true. * Every monotone transformation of a quasiconcave function is also quasiconcave. For example, if f(x) is quasiconcave and g(*) is a monotonically-increasing function, then g(f(x)) is also quasiconcave. Therefore, a natural question is: given a quasiconcave function f(x), does there exist a monotonically increasing g(*) such that g(f(x)) is concave? = Positive and negative examples = As a positive example, consider the function f(x) = x^2 in the domain x\\\\geq 0. This function is quasiconcave, but it is not concave (in fact, it is strictly convex). It can be concavified, for example, using the monotone transformation g(t) = t^{1/4}, since g(f(x))=\\\\sqrt{x} which is concave. A negative example was shown by Fenchel. His example is: f(x,y) := y + \\\\sqrt{x+y^2}. He proved that this function is quasiconcave, but there is no monotone transformation g(*) such that g(f(x,y)) is concave. Based on these examples, we define a function to be concavifiable if there exists a monotone transformation that makes it concave. The question now becomes: what quasiconcave functions are concavifiable? = Concavifiability = Yakar Kannai treats the question in depth in the context of utility functions, giving sufficient conditions under which continuous convex preferences can be represented by concave utility functions. His results were later generalized by Connell and Rasmussen, who give necessary and sufficient conditions for concavifiability. They show an example of a function that violates their conditions and thus is not concavifiable. It is f(x,y) = e^{e^x}\\\\cdot y. They prove that this function is strictly quasiconcave and its gradient is non-vanishing, but it is not concavifiable.
