Released in late 1955 on Starday Records and produced by Starday co-founder and Jones' manager Pappy Daily, it peaked at 4 on the Billboard country charts that year. It was Jones' first chart single, following several unsuccessful singles released during the prior year on Starday. Recording and composition Jones's first chart hit, \\"Why Baby Why\\", has gone on to become a country standard, having been covered by many artists. The recording session for \\"Why Baby Why\\" took place in Houston, Texas's Gold Star Studios and featured the house lineup of Glenn Barber on lead guitar, Herb Remington on pedal steel guitar, Tony Sepolio on fiddle, and Doc Lewis on piano. The arrangement is upbeat honky tonk, led by a fiddle that plays throughout the song. Overall, the song has been described as a classic of the \\"finger-pointin' cheatin' song\\". In the liner notes to the retrospective Cup Of Loneliness: The Classic Mercury Years, country music historian Colin Escott observes that part of the song's appeal \\"lay in the way a Cajun dance number was trying to break free of a honky tonk song.\\" Jones recorded the backing vocal himself, with help from innovative techniques from engineer Bill Quinn, after a planned appearance by more established singer Sonny Burns did not materialize due to the latter's drinking. According to the book George Jones: The Life and Times of a Honky Tonk Legend, Jones's frequent songwriting partner Darrell Edwards was inspired to write the words after hearing an argument between a couple at a gas station. The lyric sets up the theme of the song: Credits and personnel For the 1955 Original recording. *George Jones ‚Äì vocals, acoustic *Herb Remington ‚Äì steel *Lew Brisby ‚Äì bass *Tony Sepolio ‚Äì fiddle *Doc Lewis ‚Äì piano Reception The single's early airplay occurred in Jones' home state of Texas, with Houston's country music station KIKK ranking it number one locally. Their charts were sent to stations around the country, which began to pick it up as well, partially overcoming Starday's regionally limited distribution. However, its progress on the chart was blunted by Red Sovine and Webb Pierce's cover duet, which benefited from Decca Records' major label status and national distribution and rose to number one on the chart over the 1955‚Äì1956 Christmas holiday period. Jones's rendition was later included as the first track on his 1957 debut album Grand Ole Opry's New Star. Cover versions Since the release of Jones' rendition, \\"Why Baby Why\\" has been covered by several other artists, many of whom have also charted with it. Jones himself re-recorded it a couple of times as a duet; first with Gene Pitney for their It's Country Time Again! album released in 1966, and with Ricky Skaggs for the 1994 album The Bradley Barn Sessions which featured re-recordings of Jones' songs as duets with various artists. Two different versions of the song have reached Number One on the country charts, making it one of the only country songs to hold that distinction. Artists who have had country chart hits with renditions of this song include the following: *Red Sovine and Webb Pierce, #1 in 1956 *Hank Locklin, #9 later in 1956 *Warren Smith and Shirley Collie, #23 in 1961 *Charley Pride, #1 in 1983 *Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson recorded the song for their 1983 album Take It to the Limit. *The Good Brothers, #20 in 1991 in CanadaRPM Country Tracks - Volume 53, No. 10, February 09 1991 *Palomino Road, #46 in 1992 *Patty Loveless cut the song in 2008.

The army group consist of mostly Green Standard Army, and their goal was to quell the Taiping Rebellion around the Jiangnan region. The army group twice encircled Nanjing, the capital of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, but were defeated by the Taiping forces on both occasions. First Jiangnan DaYing Time 1853‚Äî1856: when the armies of the Taiping Rebellion occupied Nanjing, after 10 days Xiang Rong in command of a 10,000 strong Green Standard Army tracked them to Taiping and stationed outside the Nanjing wall. Headquarters The headquarters of the Jiangnan DaYing were located in Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum.

Outcome On June 1, 1856, an army tried to stop the Taiping forces but the Governor of Jiangsu Jeer Hungar (), Mayor of Nanjing, lost and his army of 7,800 were all killed. There was a heated battle from June 16 to June 20, but the Qing army of 80,000 was defeated and the surviving 36,000 followers of Xiang Rong retreated north.

The Second Opium War took place and the Xianfeng Emperor died in 1861. The Xiang Army and Huai Army combined to become the Green Standard Army in 1862 and for the third time they surrounded and attacked Nanjing, successfully ending the civil war in July 1864. Commentary The Jiangnan DaYing had trouble making payroll for its forces, and these forces were insufficient to fight off the British and French forces in northern China. The leaders intrigued against each other: Xiang Rong () and Her Chyun in the first Jiangnan DaYing Her Chyun group, and the He Guiqing and Zeng Guofan groups disputed inner officials' system, which allowed the Taiping Rebellion to gain momentum. Her Chyun could use the Brigadier General's works but he belittled the Taiping Rebellion, He Guiqing's cowardice and Zeng Guofan's selfishness, which were the three reasons for their loss.

The number, 119, refers to the number of gold medals available in events that China is targeting. The total number of golds available in the targeted sports was 122 at the targeted 2008 Olympics, an increase of three. \\"Project 119\\" is related to the Plan for Olympic Glory, a more general plan for greater performance across the board. History With the awarding of the Games of the XXIX Olympiad of 2008 to Beijing in 2001, the government of China embarked on a program to increase its medal load. Project 119 was established to gain medals in the sports of Track and Field, Swimming, Rowing & Canoe/Kayak and Sailing. These sports had a total gold medal count of 119 in the 2000 Summer Olympics. At those Games, China had only won one medal in all these sports. China wished to finish on top of the medal count and gold medal total at its own games. For rowing, China established a training centre at Thousand Island Lake, 500 km from Shanghai, and hired foreign coaches from around the world. Development Leading up the 2008 target, China harvested several fruits for their labours. * China acquired four gold medals in the Project 119 sports at the 2004 Olympics. * China tops the points table at the 2007 Amsterdam World Cup rowing regatta. * China stunned the UK at the June 2008 World Cup rowing regatta. Target Project 119 failed to live up to billing in the swimming events, resulting in only one gold medal. Entering with a powerful team in rowing, Project 119 resulted in a single gold medal for the women's quad. The men's eight failed to advance. Legacy The Beijing Olympics ended with China winning the most golds, while finishing second to the United States in total medals. This marked the first time since the 1936 Summer Olympics that neither the United States, nor the Soviet Union/Russia, had won the most gold medals at a Summer Olympics.

In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. Rivers are part of the hydrological cycle. Water generally collects in a river from precipitation through a drainage basin from surface runoff and other sources such as groundwater recharge, springs, and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (e.g., from glaciers). Rivers and streams are often considered major features within a landscape, however, they actually only cover around 0.1% of the land on Earth. They are made more obvious and significant to humans by the fact that many human cities and civilizations are built around the freshwater supplied by rivers and streams. Most of the major cities of the world are situated on the banks of rivers, as they are, or were, used as a source of water, for obtaining food, for transport, as borders, as a defensive measure, as a source of hydropower to drive machinery, for bathing, and as a means of disposing of waste. Potamology is the scientific study of rivers, while limnology is the study of inland waters in general. Topography The Colorado River at Horseshoe Bend, Arizona The Porvoo River (Porvoonjoki) in the medieval town of Porvoo, Finland A river begins at a source (or more often several sources), follows a path called a course, and ends at a mouth or mouths. The water in a river is usually confined to a channel, made up of a stream bed between banks. In larger rivers there is often also a wider floodplain shaped by flood-waters over-topping the channel. Floodplains may be very wide in relation to the size of the river channel. This distinction between river channel and floodplain can be blurred, especially in urban areas where the floodplain of a river channel can become greatly developed by housing and industry. Rivers can flow down mountains, through valleys (depressions) or along plains, and can create canyons or gorges. The term upriver (or upstream) refers to the direction towards the source of the river, i.e. against the direction of flow. Likewise, the term downriver (or downstream) describes the direction towards the mouth of the river, in which the current flows. The term left bank refers to the left bank in the direction of flow, right bank to the right. The river channel typically contains a single stream of water, but some rivers flow as several interconnecting streams of water, producing a braided river. Extensive braided rivers are now found in only a few regions worldwide, such as the South Island of New Zealand. They also occur on peneplains and some of the larger river deltas. Anastamosing rivers are similar to braided rivers and are quite rare. They have multiple sinuous channels carrying large volumes of sediment. There are rare cases of river bifurcation in which a river divides and the resultant flows ending in different seas. An example is the bifurcation of Nerodime River in Kosovo. The River Cam from the Green Dragon Bridge, Cambridge (Britain) A river flowing in its channel is a source of energy which acts on the river channel to change its shape and form. In 1757, the German hydrologist Albert Brahms empirically observed that the submerged weight of objects that may be carried away by a river is proportional to the sixth power of the river flow speed. This formulation is also sometimes called Airy's law. Thus, if the speed of flow is doubled, the flow would dislodge objects with 64 times as much submerged weight. In mountainous torrential zones this can be seen as erosion channels through hard rocks and the creation of sands and gravels from the destruction of larger rocks. A river valley that was created from a U-shaped glaciated valley, can often easily be identified by the V-shaped channel that it has carved. In the middle reaches where a river flows over flatter land, meanders may form through erosion of the river banks and deposition on the inside of bends. Sometimes the river will cut off a loop, shortening the channel and forming an oxbow lake or billabong. Rivers that carry large amounts of sediment may develop conspicuous deltas at their mouths. Rivers whose mouths are in saline tidal waters may form estuaries. Throughout the course of the river, the total volume of water transported downstream will often be a combination of the free water flow together with a substantial volume flowing through sub-surface rocks and gravels that underlie the river and its floodplain (called the hyporheic zone). For many rivers in large valleys, this unseen component of flow may greatly exceed the visible flow. Melting toe of Athabasca Glacier, Jasper National Park, Alberta, Canada Subsurface streams Most but not all rivers flow on the surface. Subterranean rivers flow underground in caves or caverns. Such rivers are frequently found in regions with limestone geologic formations. Subglacial streams are the braided rivers that flow at the beds of glaciers and ice sheets, permitting meltwater to be discharged at the front of the glacier. Because of the gradient in pressure due to the overlying weight of the glacier, such streams can even flow uphill. Permanence of flow An intermittent river (or ephemeral river) only flows occasionally and can be dry for several years at a time. These rivers are found in regions with limited or highly variable rainfall, or can occur because of geologic conditions such as a highly permeable river bed. Some ephemeral rivers flow during the summer months but not in the winter. Such rivers are typically fed from chalk aquifers which recharge from winter rainfall. In England these rivers are called bournes and give their name to places such as Bournemouth and Eastbourne. Even in humid regions, the location where flow begins in the smallest tributary streams generally moves upstream in response to precipitation and downstream in its absence or when active summer vegetation diverts water for evapotranspiration. Normally-dry rivers in arid zones are often identified as arroyos or other regional names. The meltwater from large hailstorms can create a slurry of water, hail and sand or soil, forming temporary rivers.\\"Sand River\\" in Iraq is actually a rapid movement of ice blocks.

The Nile is an example of a wave- dominated delta that has the classic Greek letter delta (Œî) shape after which river deltas were named. Titan Rivers have been classified by many criteria including their topography, their biotic status, and their relevance to white water rafting or canoeing activities. Topographical classification Rivers can generally be classified as either alluvial, bedrock, or some mix of the two. Alluvial rivers have channels and floodplains that are self-formed in unconsolidated or weakly consolidated sediments. They erode their banks and deposit material on bars and their floodplains. Bedrock rivers form when the river downcuts through the modern sediments and into the underlying bedrock. This occurs in regions that have experienced some kind of uplift (thereby steepening river gradients) or in which a particular hard lithology causes a river to have a steepened reach that has not been covered in modern alluvium. Bedrock rivers very often contain alluvium on their beds; this material is important in eroding and sculpting the channel. Rivers that go through patches of bedrock and patches of deep alluvial cover are classified as mixed bedrock- alluvial. Alluvial rivers can be further classified by their channel pattern as meandering, braided, wandering, anastomose, or straight. The morphology of an alluvial river reach is controlled by a combination of sediment supply, substrate composition, discharge, vegetation, and bed aggradation. At the start of the 20th century William Morris Davis devised the \\"cycle of erosion\\" method of classifying rivers based on their \\"age\\". Although Davis's system is still found in many books today, after the 1950s and 1960s it became increasingly criticized and rejected by geomorphologists. His scheme did not produce testable hypotheses and was therefore deemed non-scientific. Examples of Davis's river \\"ages\\" include: * Youthful river: A river with a steep gradient that has very few tributaries and flows quickly. Its channels erode deeper rather than wider. Examples are the Brazos, Trinity and Ebro rivers. * Mature river: A river with a gradient that is less steep than those of youthful rivers and flows more slowly. A mature river is fed by many tributaries and has more discharge than a youthful river. Its channels erode wider rather than deeper. Examples are the Mississippi, Saint Lawrence, Danube, Ohio, Thames and Paran√° rivers. * Old river: A river with a low gradient and low erosive energy. Old rivers are characterized by flood plains. Examples are the Yellow, lower Ganges, Tigris, Euphrates, Indus and lower Nile rivers. * Rejuvenated river: A river with a gradient that is raised by tectonic uplift. Examples are the Rio Grande and Colorado River. The ways in which a river's characteristics vary between its upper and lower course are summarized by the Bradshaw model. Power-law relationships between channel slope, depth, and width are given as a function of discharge by \\"river regime\\". Biotic classification There are several systems of classification based on biotic conditions typically assigning classes from the most oligotrophic or unpolluted through to the most eutrophic or polluted.River Classification scheme. sepa.org.uk Other systems are based on a whole eco-system approach such as developed by the New Zealand Ministry for the Environment.NZ‚Äôs River Environment Classification system (REC). maf.govt.nz In Europe, the requirements of the Water Framework Directive has led to the development of a wide range of classification methods including classifications based on fishery statusNoble, Richard and Cowx, Ian et al. (May 2002) Compilation and harmonisation of fish species classification. University of Hull, UK. A project under the 5th Framework Programme Energy, Environment and Sustainable Management. Key Action 1: Sustainable Management and Quality of Water A system of river zonation used in francophone communities divides rivers into three primary zones: * The crenon is the uppermost zone at the source of the river. It is further divided into the eucrenon (spring or boil zone) and the hypocrenon (brook or headstream zone). These areas have low temperatures, reduced oxygen content and slow moving water. * The rhithron is the upstream portion of the river that follows the crenon. It has relatively cool temperatures, high oxygen levels, and fast, turbulent, swift flow. * The potamon is the remaining downstream stretch of river. It has warmer temperatures, lower oxygen levels, slow flow and sandier bottoms. Whitewater classification The International Scale of River Difficulty is used to rate the challenges of navigation‚Äîparticularly those with rapids. Class I is the easiest and Class VI is the hardest. Stream order classification The Strahler Stream Order ranks rivers based on the connectivity and hierarchy of contributing tributaries. Headwaters are first order while the Amazon River is twelfth order. Approximately 80% of the rivers and streams in the world are of the first and second order. In certain languages, distinctions are made among rivers based on their stream order. In French, for example, rivers that run to the sea are called fleuve, while other rivers are called rivi√®re. For example, in Canada, the Churchill River in Manitoba is called la rivi√®re Churchill as it runs to Hudson Bay, but the Churchill River in Labrador is called le fleuve Churchill as it runs to the Atlantic Ocean. As most rivers in France are known by their names only without the word rivi√®re or fleuve (e.g. la Seine, not le fleuve Seine, even though the Seine is classed as a fleuve), one of the most prominent rivers in the Francophonie commonly known as fleuve is le fleuve Saint-Laurent (the Saint Lawrence River). Since many fleuves are large and prominent, receiving many tributaries, the word is sometimes used to refer to certain large rivers that flow into other fleuves; however, even small streams that run to the sea are called fleuve (e.g. fleuve c√¥tier, \\"coastal fleuve\\").

Rivers have been a source of food since pre-history.\\"National Museum of Prehistory-The Peinan Site-Settlements of the Prehistoric Times\\". nmp.gov.tw. They are often a rich source of fish and other edible aquatic life, and are a major source of fresh water, which can be used for drinking and irrigation. Rivers help to determine the urban form of cities and neighbourhoods and their corridors often present opportunities for urban renewal through the development of foreshoreways such as river walks. Rivers also provide an easy means of disposing of waste water and, in much of the less developed world, other wastes. Rivers have been used for navigation for thousands of years. The earliest evidence of navigation is found in the Indus Valley Civilization, which existed in northwestern India around 3300 BC.\\"WWF ‚Äì The World's Rivers\\". panda.org. Riverine navigation provides a cheap means of transport, and is still used extensively on most major rivers of the world like the Amazon, the Ganges, the Nile, the Mississippi, and the Indus. Since river boats are often not regulated, they contribute a large amount to global greenhouse gas emissions, and to local cancer due to inhaling of particulates emitted by the transports. Rivers have been important in determining political boundaries and defending countries. For example, the Danube was a long- standing border of the Roman Empire, and today it forms most of the border between Bulgaria and Romania. The Mississippi in North America and the Rhine in Europe are major east-west boundaries in those continents. The Orange and Limpopo Rivers in southern Africa form the boundaries between provinces and countries along their routes. In some heavily forested regions such as Scandinavia and Canada, lumberjacks use the river to float felled trees downstream to lumber camps for further processing, saving much effort and cost by transporting the huge heavy logs by natural means. Watermill in Belgium Fast flowing rivers and waterfalls are widely used as sources of energy, via watermills and hydroelectric plants. Evidence of watermills shows them in use for many hundreds of years, for instance in Orkney at Dounby Click Mill. Prior to the invention of steam power, watermills for grinding cereals and for processing wool and other textiles were common across Europe. In the 1890s the first machines to generate power from river water were established at places such as Cragside in Northumberland and in recent decades there has been a significant increase in the development of large scale power generation from water, especially in wet mountainous regions such as Norway. The coarse sediments, gravel, and sand, generated and moved by rivers are extensively used in construction. In parts of the world this can generate extensive new lake habitats as gravel pits re-fill with water. In other circumstances it can destabilise the river bed and the course of the river and cause severe damage to spawning fish populations which rely on stable gravel formations for egg laying. In upland rivers, rapids with whitewater or even waterfalls occur. Rapids are often used for recreation, such as whitewater kayaking. Ecosystem The organisms in the riparian zone respond to changes in river channel location and patterns of flow. The ecosystem of rivers is generally described by the river continuum concept, which has some additions and refinements to allow for dams and waterfalls and temporary extensive flooding. The concept describes the river as a system in which the physical parameters, the availability of food particles and the composition of the ecosystem are continuously changing along its length. The food (energy) that remains from the upstream part is used downstream. The general pattern is that the first order streams contain particulate matter (decaying leaves from the surrounding forests) which is processed there by shredders like Plecoptera larvae. The products of these shredders are used by collectors, such as Hydropsychidae, and further downstream algae that create the primary production become the main food source of the organisms. All changes are gradual and the distribution of each species can be described as a normal curve, with the highest density where the conditions are optimal. In rivers succession is virtually absent and the composition of the ecosystem stays fixed . Chemistry The chemistry of rivers is complex and depends on inputs from the atmosphere, the geology through which it travels and the inputs from man's activities. The chemical composition of the water has a large impact on the ecology of that water for both plants and animals and it also affects the uses that may be made of the river water. Understanding and characterising river water chemistry requires a well designed and managed sampling and analysis. Brackish water Brackish waster occurs in most rivers where they meet the sea. The extent of brackish water may extend a significant distance upstream, especially in areas with high tidal ranges.  Flooding  Flash flooding caused by a large amount of rain falling in a short amount of time Flooding is a natural part of a river's cycle. The majority of the erosion of river channels and the erosion and deposition on the associated floodplains occur during the flood stage. In many developed areas, human activity has changed the form of river channels, altering magnitudes and frequencies of flooding. Some examples of this are the building of levees, the straightening of channels, and the draining of natural wetlands. In many cases human activities in rivers and floodplains have dramatically increased the risk of flooding. Straightening rivers allows water to flow more rapidly downstream, increasing the risk of flooding places further downstream. Building on flood plains removes flood storage, which again exacerbates downstream flooding. The building of levees only protects the area behind the levees and not those further downstream. Levees and flood-banks can also increase flooding upstream because of the back-water pressure as the river flow is impeded by the narrow channel banks. Detention basins finally also reduce the risk of flooding significantly by being able to take up some of the flood water. Flow Studying the flows of rivers is one aspect of hydrology. Direction River meandering course Rivers flow downhill with their power derived from gravity. The direction can involve all directions of the compass and can be a complex meandering path. Rivers flowing downhill, from river source to river mouth, do not necessarily take the shortest path. For alluvial streams, straight and braided rivers have very low sinuosity and flow directly down hill, while meandering rivers flow from side to side across a valley. Bedrock rivers typically flow in either a fractal pattern, or a pattern that is determined by weaknesses in the bedrock, such as faults, fractures, or more erodible layers. Rate Volumetric flow rate, also known as discharge, volume flow rate, and rate of water flow, is the volume of water which passes through a given cross-section of the river channel per unit time. It is typically measured in cubic metres per second (cumec) or cubic feet per second (cfs), where 1 m3/s = 35.51 ft3/s; it is sometimes also measured in litres or gallons per second. Volumetric flow rate can be thought of as the mean velocity of the flow through a given cross-section, times that cross-sectional area. Mean velocity can be approximated through the use of the Law of the Wall. In general, velocity increases with the depth (or hydraulic radius) and slope of the river channel, while the cross-sectional area scales with the depth and the width: the double-counting of depth shows the importance of this variable in determining the discharge through the channel.  Fluvial erosion  In its youthful stage the river causes erosion in the water-course, deepening the valley. Hydraulic action loosens and dislodges the rock which further erodes the banks and the river bed. Over time, this deepens the river bed and creates steeper sides which are then weathered. The steepened nature of the banks causes the sides of the valley to move downslope causing the valley to become V-shaped. Waterfalls also form in the youthful river valley where a band of hard rock overlays a layer of soft rock. Differential erosion occurs as the river erodes the soft rock more readily than the hard rock, this leaves the hard rock more elevated and stands out from the river below. A plunge pool forms at the bottom and deepens as a result of hydraulic action and abrasion.  Sediment yield  Sediment yield is the total quantity of particulate matter (suspended or bedload) reaching the outlet of a drainage basin over a fixed time frame. Yield is usually expressed as kilograms per square kilometre per year. Sediment delivery processes are affected by a myriad of factors such as drainage area size, basin slope, climate, sediment type (lithology), vegetation cover, and human land use / management practices. The theoretical concept of the 'sediment delivery ratio' (ratio between yield and total amount of sediment eroded) captures the fact that not all of the sediment is eroded within a certain catchment that reaches out to the outlet (due to, for example, deposition on floodplains). Such storage opportunities are typically increased in catchments of larger size, thus leading to a lower yield and sediment delivery ratio. Frozen river in Alaska Management River bank repair Rivers are often managed or controlled to make them more useful or less disruptive to human activity. * Dams or weirs may be built to control the flow, store water, or extract energy. * Levees, known as dikes in Europe, may be built to prevent river water from flowing on floodplains or floodways. * Canals connect rivers to one another for water transfer or navigation. * River courses may be modified to improve navigation, or straightened to increase the flow rate. River management is a continuous activity as rivers tend to 'undo' the modifications made by people. Dredged channels silt up, sluice mechanisms deteriorate with age, levees and dams may suffer seepage or catastrophic failure. The benefits sought through managing rivers may often be offset by the social and economic costs of mitigating the bad effects of such management. As an example, in parts of the developed world, rivers have been confined within channels to free up flat flood-plain land for development. Floods can inundate such development at high financial cost and often with loss of life. Rivers are increasingly managed for habitat conservation, as they are critical for many aquatic and riparian plants, resident and migratory fishes, waterfowl, birds of prey, migrating birds, and many mammals.

It is one of the largest freshwater high-altitude (alpine) lakes in Eurasia Peyto Lake, Alberta, Canada A lake is an area filled with water, localized in a basin, surrounded by land, apart from any river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake. Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean, although like the much larger oceans, they form part of earth's water cycle. Lakes are distinct from lagoons which are generally coastal parts of the ocean. They are generally larger and deeper than ponds, which also lie on land, though there are no official or scientific definitions. Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams, which are usually flowing in a channel on land. Most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams. Natural lakes are generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones, and areas with ongoing glaciation. Other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers, where a river channel has widened into a basin. In some parts of the world there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last Ice Age. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them. Many lakes are artificial and are constructed for industrial or agricultural use, for hydro-electric power generation or domestic water supply, or for aesthetic, recreational purposes, or other activities.  Etymology, meaning, and usage of \\"lake\\"  Oeschinen Lake in the Swiss Alps Lake Tahoe on the border of California and Nevada The word lake comes from Middle English lake (\\"lake, pond, waterway\\"), from Old English lacu (\\"pond, pool, stream\\"), from Proto-Germanic *lak≈ç (\\"pond, ditch, slow moving stream\\"), from the Proto-Indo-European root *le«µ- (\\"to leak, drain\\"). Cognates include Dutch laak (\\"lake, pond, ditch\\"), Middle Low German lƒÅke (\\"water pooled in a riverbed, puddle\\") as in: :de:Wolfslake, :de:Butterlake, German Lache (\\"pool, puddle\\"), and Icelandic l√¶kur (\\"slow flowing stream\\"). Also related are the English words leak and leach. There is considerable uncertainty about defining the difference between lakes and ponds, and no current internationally accepted definition of either term across scientific disciplines or political boundaries exists. For example, limnologists have defined lakes as water bodies which are simply a larger version of a pond, which can have wave action on the shoreline or where wind-induced turbulence plays a major role in mixing the water column. None of these definitions completely excludes ponds and all are difficult to measure. For this reason, simple size-based definitions are increasingly used to separate ponds and lakes. Definitions for lake range in minimum sizes for a body of water from to (see also the definition of \\"pond\\"). Charles Elton, one of the founders of ecology, regarded lakes as waterbodies of or more. The term lake is also used to describe a feature such as Lake Eyre, which is a dry basin most of the time but may become filled under seasonal conditions of heavy rainfall. In common usage, many lakes bear names ending with the word pond, and a lesser number of names ending with lake are in quasi-technical fact, ponds. One textbook illustrates this point with the following: \\"In Newfoundland, for example, almost every lake is called a pond, whereas in Wisconsin, almost every pond is called a lake.\\" One hydrology book proposes to define the term \\"lake\\" as a body of water with the following five characteristics: * it partially or totally fills one or several basins connected by straits * has essentially the same water level in all parts (except for relatively short-lived variations caused by wind, varying ice cover, large inflows, etc.) * it does not have regular intrusion of seawater * a considerable portion of the sediment suspended in the water is captured by the basins (for this to happen they need to have a sufficiently small inflow- to-volume ratio) * the area measured at the mean water level exceeds an arbitrarily chosen threshold (for instance, one hectare) With the exception of the seawater intrusion criterion, the others have been accepted or elaborated upon by other hydrology publications.  Distribution  lakes in Finland larger than 500 square metres. Isoj√§rvi is the 97th largest lake in Finland. The majority of lakes on Earth are freshwater, and most lie in the Northern Hemisphere at higher latitudes. Canada, with a deranged drainage system, has an estimated 31,752 lakes larger than Lakes. The Atlas of Canada. Natural Resources Canada () and an unknown total number of lakes, but is estimated to be at least 2 million. Finland has 187,888 lakes or larger, of which 56,000 are large ( or larger). Most lakes have at least one natural outflow in the form of a river or stream, which maintain a lake's average level by allowing the drainage of excess water. Some lakes do not have a natural outflow and lose water solely by evaporation or underground seepage or both. They are termed endorheic lakes. Many lakes are artificial and are constructed for hydro-electric power generation, aesthetic purposes, recreational purposes, industrial use, agricultural use or domestic water supply. Evidence of extraterrestrial lakes exists; \\"definitive evidence of lakes filled with methane\\" was announced by NASA as returned by the Cassini Probe observing the moon Titan, which orbited the planet Saturn. Globally, lakes are greatly outnumbered by ponds: of an estimated 304 million standing water bodies worldwide, 91% are or less in area (see definition of ponds). Small lakes are also much more numerous than large lakes: in terms of area, one-third of the world's standing water is represented by lakes and ponds of or less. However, large lakes account for much of the area of standing water with 122 large lakes of 1,000 square kilometres (390 sq mi, 100,000 ha, 247,000 acres) or more representing about 29% of the total global area of standing inland water.  Types  The Seven Rila Lakes are a group of glacial lakes in the Bulgarian Rila mountains In 1957, HutchinsonHutchinson, G.E. (1957). A treatise on limnology, v. 1. Geography, Physics and Chemistry.Wiley. published a monograph that is regarded as a landmark discussion and classification of all major lake types, their origin, morphometric characteristics, and distribution.Cohen, A.S. (2003). Paleolimnology: the history and evolution of lake systems. Oxford University Press.H√•kanson, L., and Jansson, J. (1983). Principles of Lake Sedimentology. Springer-Verlag, New York. H√•kanson, L. (2012). \\"Lakes on Earth, Different Types\\". In Encyclopedia of Lakes and Reservoirs. pp. 471‚Äì472. Springer Netherlands. As summarized and discussed by these researchers, Hutchinson presented in it a comprehensive analysis of the origin of lakes and proposed what is a widely accepted classification of lakes according to their origin. This classification recognizes 11 major lake types that are divided into 76 subtypes. The 11 major lake types are tectonic lakes, volcanic lakes, landslide lakes, glacial lakes, solution lakes, fluvial lakes, aeolian lakes, shoreline lakes, organic lakes, anthropogenic lakes, and meteorite (extraterrestrial impact) lakes. Tectonic lakes Tectonic lakes are lakes formed by the deformation and resulting lateral and vertical movements of the Earth's crust. These movements include faulting, tilting, folding, and warping. Some of the well-known and largest lakes on Earth are rift lakes occupying rift valleys, e.g. Central African Rift lakes and Lake Baikal. Other well-known tectonic lakes, Caspian Sea, the Sea of Aral, and other lakes from the Pontocaspian occupy basins that have been separated from the sea by the tectonic uplift of the sea floor above sea level. Often, the tectonic action of crustal extension has created an alternating series of parallel grabens and horsts that form elongate basins alternating with mountain ranges. Not only does this promote the creation of lakes by the disruption of preexisting drainage networks, it also creates within arid regions endorheic basins that containing salt lakes (also called saline lakes). They form where there is no natural outlet, a high evaporation rate and the drainage surface of the water table has a higher-than-normal salt content. Examples of these salt lakes include Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea. Another type of tectonic lake caused by faulting is sag ponds. Volcanic lakes Volc√°n Iraz√∫, Costa Rica Volcanic lakes are lakes that occupy either local depressions, e.g. craters and maars or larger basins, e.g. calderas, created by volcanism. Crater lakes are formed in volcanic craters and calderas, which fill up with precipitation more rapidly than they empty via either evaporation, groundwater discharge, or combination of both. Sometimes the latter are called caldera lakes, although often no distinction is made. An example is Crater Lake in Oregon, in the caldera of Mount Mazama. The caldera was created in a massive volcanic eruption that led to the subsidence of Mount Mazama around 4860 BCE. Other volcanic lakes are created when either rivers or streams are dammed by lava flows or volcanic lahars. The basin which is now Malheur Lake, Oregon was created when a lava flow dammed the Malheur River. Lake Kaniere is a glacial lake in the West Coast region of New Zealand. Glacial lakes Glacial lakes are lakes created by the direct action of glaciers and continental ice sheets. A wide variety of glacial processes create enclosed basins. As a result, there are a wide variety of different types of glacial lakes and it is often difficult to define clear-cut distinctions between different types of glacial lakes and lakes influenced by other activities. The general types of glacial lakes that have recognized are lakes in direct contact with ice; glacially carved rock basins and depressions; morainic and outwash lakes; and glacial drift basins. Glacial lakes are the most numerous lakes in the world. Most lakes in northern Europe and North America have been either influenced or created by the latest, but not last, glaciation, to have covered the region. Glacial lakes include proglacial lakes, subglacial lakes, finger lakes, and epishelf lakes. Epishelf lakes are highly stratified lakes in which a layer of freshwater, derived from ice and snow melt, is dammed behind an ice shelf that is attached to the coastline. They are mostly found in Antarctica. Fluvial lakes Fluvial (or riverine) lakes are lakes produced by running water. These lakes include plunge pool lakes, fluviatile dams and meander lakes. = Oxbow lakes = The most common type of fluvial lake is a crescent-shaped lake called an oxbow lake due to the distinctive curved shape. They can form in river valleys as a result of meandering. The slow-moving river forms a sinuous shape as the outer side of bends are eroded away more rapidly than the inner side. Eventually a horseshoe bend is formed and the river cuts through the narrow neck. This new passage then forms the main passage for the river and the ends of the bend become silted up, thus forming a bow-shaped lake. = Fluviatile dams = These form where sediment from a tributary blocks the main river. = Lateral lakes = These form where sediment from the main river blocks a tributary, usually in the form of a levee. Solution lakes A solution lake is a lake occupying a basin formed by surface dissolution of bedrock. In areas underlain by soluble bedrock, its solution by precipitation and percolating water commonly produce cavities. These cavities frequently collapse to form sinkholes that form part of the local karst topography. Where groundwater lies near the grounds surface, a sinkhole will be filled water as a solution lake. If such a lake consists of a large area of standing water that occupies an extensive closed depression in limestone, it is also called a karst lake. Smaller solution lakes that consist of a body of standing water in a closed depression within a karst region are known as karst ponds.Neuendorf, K.K.E., Mehl Jr., J.P., and Jackson, J.A. (2005). Glossary of Geology, 5th revised and enlarged ed. Berlin: Springer. Approx. . Limestone caves often contain pools of standing water, which are known as underground lakes. Classic examples of solution lakes are abundant in the karst regions at the Dalmatian coast of Croatia and within large parts of Florida. Landslide lakes Landslide lakes are lakes created by the blockage of a valley by either mudflows, rockslides, or screes. Such lakes are common in mountainous regions. Although landslide lakes may be large and quite deep, they are typically short-lived. An example of a landslide lake is Quake Lake, which formed as a result of the 1959 Hebgen Lake earthquake.Myers, W.B. and Hamilton, W. (1964). The Hebgen Lake, Montana, earthquake of August 17, 1959. Geological Survey Professional Paper, 435, p. 51. Aeolian lakes Aeolian lakes are lakes produced by wind action. They are found mainly in arid environments although some aeolian lakes are relict landforms indicative of arid paleoclimates. Aeolian lakes consist of lake basins dammed by wind-blown sand; interdunal lakes that lies between well-oriented sand dunes; and deflation basins formed by wind action under previously arid paleoenvironments. Moses Lake, Washington, is an example of a lake basins dammed by wind-blown sand. Shoreline lakes Shoreline lakes are generally lakes created by blockage of estuaries or by the uneven accretion of beach ridges by longshore and other currents. They include maritime coastal lakes, ordinarily in drowned estuaries; lakes enclosed by two tombolos or spits connecting an island to the mainland; lakes cut off from larger lakes by a bar; or lakes divided by the meeting of two spits. Organic lakes Organic lakes are lakes created by the actions of plants and animals. On the whole they are relatively rare in occurrence and quite small in size. In addition, they typically ephemeral features relative to the other types of lakes. The basins in which organic lakes occur are associated with beaver dams, coral lakes, or dams formed by vegetation. = Peat lakes = Peat lakes are a form of organic lake. They form where a buildup of partly decomposed plant material in a wet environment leaves the vegetated surface below the water table for a sustained period of time. They are often low in nutrients and mildly acidic, with bottom waters low in dissolved oxygen. Anthropogenic lakes Anthropogenic lakes are artificially created lakes formed by human activity. They can be the result of intentional damming of rivers and streams or subsequent filling of abandoned excavations by either ground water, precipitation, or a combination of both. Meteorite (extraterrestrial impact/ crater) lakes Meteorite lakes, which are also known as crater lakes, are lakes created by catastrophic extraterrestrial impacts by either meteorites or asteroids. Examples of meteorite lakes are Lonar crater lake, India, Lake Elgygytgyn, and Pingualuit crater lake, Quebec, Canada, As in case of Lake El'gygytgyn and Pingualuit crater lake, meteorite (extraterrestrial impact/ crater) lakes can contain unique and scientifically valuable sedimentary deposits associated with long records of paleoclimatic changes.  Other types  These kettle lakes in Alaska were formed by a retreating glacier Ice Melting on Lake Balaton In addition to mode of origin, lakes have been named and classified in various other ways according to their thermal stratification, salinity, relative seasonal permanence, degree of outflow, and other factors. Also, different cultures and regional of the world have their popular nomenclature  Types of lakes according to thermal stratification  In addition to their origin, there are various other ways of either naming or defining types of lakes. One major way of classification lakes in on the basis of thermal stratification because it is a major control on animal and plant life inhabiting a lake and the fate and distribution of dissolved and suspended material in a lake. For example, the thermal stratification and the degree and frequency of mixing exerts a strong control on the distribution of oxygen within it. In addition, lake can be classified according important factors such as seasonal variations in lake volume and level, oxygen saturation, and salinity of its water mass. Finally, the names of types of lakes that are used by the lay public and in the scientific for different types of lakes are often informally derived from either from their morphology of other aspects or their physical characteristics. F.A. Forel,Forel, F.A., 1901. Handbuch der Seenkunde. Allgemeine Limnologie. J. von Engelhorn, Stuttgart, Germany. who is also referred to as the father of limnology, was the first scientist to classify lakes according to their thermal stratification. His system of classification was later modified and improved upon by Hutchinson and Laffler. Because the density of water varies with temperature, with a maximum at +4 DC, thermal stratification is an important physical characteristic of lakes that controls the fauna and flora, sedimentation, chemistry, and other aspects of individual lakes. First, the colder, heavier water typically forms a layer near the bottom, which called the hypolimnion. Second, normally overlying it is a transition zone known as the metalimnion. Finally, overlying the metalimnion is a surface layer of a warmer, lighter water is called the epilimnion. However, this typical stratification sequence can vary widely depending either on the specific lake, the time of season, or combination of both. Based upon thermal stratification, lakes are classified as either holomictic lakes or meromictic lakes. A meromictic lake is a lake which has layers of water which do not intermix. The deepest layer of water in such a lake does not contain any dissolved oxygen. In addition, the layers of sediment at the bottom of a meromictic lake remain relatively undisturbed because there are no living aerobic organisms. The lack of disturbance allows for the development of lacustrine varves. A Holomictic lake is a lake that has a uniform temperature and density from top to bottom at a specific time during the year. This uniformity temperature and density in allows the lake waters to completely mix. Holomictic lakes are non-meromictic lakes. Based upon thermal stratification and frequency of turnover, holomictic lakes are divided into amictic lakes, cold monomictic lakes, dimictic lakes, warm monomictic lakes, polymictic lakes, and oligomictic lakes. The classification of lakes by thermal stratification presupposes lakes with sufficient depth to form a hypolimnion. As a results, very shallow lakes are excluded this classification system. The stratification in a lake is not always the result of variation to density because of thermal gradients. Stratification within a lake can also be the result of differences in density resulting from gradients in salinity. In case of a difference in salinity, the hypolimnion and epilimnion are separated not by a thermocline but by a halocline, which is sometimes referred to as a chemocline.  Types of lake according to seasonal variation of lake level and volume  Lakes are informally classified and named according to the seasonal variation in their lake level and volume. Some of the names include: * Ephemeral lake is a short- lived lake or pond. If it fills with water and dries up (disappears) seasonally it is known as an intermittent lakePoehls, D.J. and Smith, G.J. eds. (2009). Encyclopedic dictionary of hydrogeology. Academic Press. p. 517. They often fill poljes * Dry lake is a popular name for an ephemeral lake that contains water only intermediately at irregular and infrequent intervals.Last, W.M. and Smol, J.P. (2001). Tracking environmental change using lake sediments. Volume 1: basin analysis, coring, and chronological techniques. Springer Science & Business Media. * Perennial lake is a lake that has water in its basin throughout the year and is not subject to extreme fluctuations in level.Gangstad, E.O., (1979). Glossary of Biolimnological Terms. Washington, DC, United States Army Corps of Engineers. * Playa lake is a typically shallow, intermittent lake that covers or occupies a playa either in wet seasons or in especially wet years but subsequently drying up in an arid or semiarid region. * Vlei is a name used in South Africa for a shallow lake which varies considerably in level with the seasons.Theal, G.M., 1877. Compendium of South African history and geography, 3rd. Institution Press, Lovedale, South Africa.  Types of lake according to water chemistry  Lakes are also informally classified and named according to the general chemistry of their water mass. Some of the types of lakes include: * An acid lake is a lake that has a pH is below neutral (<6.5). A lake is considered highly acidic when the pH drops below 5.5, below which when biological consequences occur. Such lakes include acid pit lakes occupying abandoned mines and excavations; naturally acid lakes of igneous and metamorphic landscapes; peat bogs in northern regions; acid-saline lakes of arid environments; crater lakes of active and dormant volcanoes; and lakes acidified by acid rain.Geller, W. et al. (eds.) (2013). Acidic Pit Lakes, Environmental Science and Engineering, Springer-Verlag Berlin HeidelbergRouwet, D. et al. (eds.) (2015). Volcanic Lakes, Advances in Volcanology, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg * A salt lake, which also known as a brine lake, is an inland body of water situated in an arid or semiarid region, having no outlet to the sea, and containing a high concentration of dissolved salts (principally sodium chloride). Examples include the Great Salt Lake in Utah, and the Dead Sea in the Near East. * alkali sink, also known as salt flats, are lakes on the other extreme of the scale from the large and deep saline lakes. They are, shallow saline features that occupy low-lying areas of the arid regions and in groundwater discharge zones. These are typically classifiable as either playas or playa lakes because they are periodically flooded by either rain or flood events and then dry up during drier intervals, leaving accumulations of brines and evaporitic minerals. * A salt pan (saltpan) is either an undrained small shallow natural depression in which water accumulates and evaporates leaving a salt deposit or the shallow lake of brackish water occupying a salt pan. This term is also used for a large pan for recovering salt by evaporation. * A saline pan is a name for an ephemeral saline lake which precipitates a bottom crust that is subsequently modified during subaerial exposure.  Lakes composed of other liquids  * Lava lake is a large volume of molten lava, usually basaltic, contained in a volcanic vent, crater, or broad depression. * Hydrocarbon lakes are bodies of liquid ethane and methane that occupy depressions on the surface of Titan. They were detected by the Cassini‚ÄìHuygens space probe.  Paleolakes  A paleolake, also spelt palaeolake, is a lake that existed in the past when hydrological conditions were different.Cohen, A. S. (2003). Paleolimnology. History and Evolution of Lake Systems. Oxford University Press, Oxford. Quaternary paleolakes can often be identified on the basis of relict lacustrine landforms such as relict lake plains and coastal landforms that form recognizable relict shorelines, which are called paleoshorelines. Paleolakes can also be recognized by characteristic sedimentary deposits that accumulated in them and any fossils that these sediments might contain. The paleoshorelines and sedimentary deposits of paleolakes provide evidence for prehistoric hydrological changes during the times that they existed.Goudie, A. (2008). \\"Arid Climates and Indicators\\". Gornitz, V. ed., Encyclopedia of paleoclimatology and ancient environments. Springer Science & Business Media. pp. 45‚Äì51. Types of paleolakes include: * A former lake is a lake which is no longer in existence. Such lakes include prehistoric lakes and lakes which have permanently dried up often as the result of either evaporation or human intervention. Owens Lake in California, USA, is an example of a former lake. Former lakes are a common feature of the Basin and Range area of southwestern North America. * A shrunken lake is a lake which has drastically decreased in size over geological time. Lake Agassiz, which once covered much of central North America, is a good example of a shrunken lake. Two notable remnants of this lake are Lake Winnipeg and Lake Winnipegosis. Paleolakes are of scientific and economic importance. For example, Quaternary paleolakes in semidesert basins are important for two reasons. First, they played an extremely significant, if transient, role in shaping the floors and piedmonts of many basins. Finally, their sediments contain enormous quantities of geologic and paleontologic information concerning past environments. In addition, the organic-rich deposits of pre-Quaternary paleolakes are important either for the thick deposits of oil shale and shale gas that they contain or as source rocks of petroleum and natural gas. Although of significantly less economic importance, strata deposited along the shore of paleolakes sometimes contain coal seams.Gierlowski-Kordesch, E. and Kelts, K.R. eds. (2000). Lake Basins Through Space and Time. AAPG Studies in Geology 46 (No. 46). The American Association of Petroleum Geologists, Tulsa, OK  Characteristics  Many lakes can have tremendous cultural importance. The West Lake of Hangzhou has inspired romantic poets throughout the ages, and has been an important influence on garden designs in China, Japan and Korea.Ancient Chinese cultural landscape, the West Lake of Hangzhou, inscribed on UNESCO‚Äôs World Heritage List. UNESCO (24 June 2011) Lake Mapourika, New Zealand Lakes have numerous features in addition to lake type, such as drainage basin (also known as catchment area), inflow and outflow, nutrient content, dissolved oxygen, pollutants, pH, and sedimentation. Changes in the level of a lake are controlled by the difference between the input and output compared to the total volume of the lake. Significant input sources are precipitation onto the lake, runoff carried by streams and channels from the lake's catchment area, groundwater channels and aquifers, and artificial sources from outside the catchment area. Output sources are evaporation from the lake, surface and groundwater flows, and any extraction of lake water by humans. As climate conditions and human water requirements vary, these will create fluctuations in the lake level. Lakes can be also categorized on the basis of their richness in nutrients, which typically affect plant growth. Nutrient-poor lakes are said to be oligotrophic and are generally clear, having a low concentration of plant life. Mesotrophic lakes have good clarity and an average level of nutrients. Eutrophic lakes are enriched with nutrients, resulting in good plant growth and possible algal blooms. Hypertrophic lakes are bodies of water that have been excessively enriched with nutrients. These lakes typically have poor clarity and are subject to devastating algal blooms. Lakes typically reach this condition due to human activities, such as heavy use of fertilizers in the lake catchment area. Such lakes are of little use to humans and have a poor ecosystem due to decreased dissolved oxygen. Due to the unusual relationship between water's temperature and its density, lakes form layers called thermoclines, layers of drastically varying temperature relative to depth. Fresh water is most dense at about 4 degrees Celsius (39.2 ¬∞F) at sea level. When the temperature of the water at the surface of a lake reaches the same temperature as deeper water, as it does during the cooler months in temperate climates, the water in the lake can mix, bringing oxygen-starved water up from the depths and bringing oxygen down to decomposing sediments. Deep temperate lakes can maintain a reservoir of cold water year-round, which allows some cities to tap that reservoir for deep lake water cooling. Lake Teletskoye, Siberia Since the surface water of deep tropical lakes never reaches the temperature of maximum density, there is no process that makes the water mix. The deeper layer becomes oxygen starved and can become saturated with carbon dioxide, or other gases such as sulfur dioxide if there is even a trace of volcanic activity. Exceptional events, such as earthquakes or landslides, can cause mixing which rapidly brings the deep layers up to the surface and release a vast cloud of gas which lay trapped in solution in the colder water at the bottom of the lake. This is called a limnic eruption. An example is the disaster at Lake Nyos in Cameroon. The amount of gas that can be dissolved in water is directly related to pressure. As deep water surfaces, the pressure drops and a vast amount of gas comes out of solution. Under these circumstances carbon dioxide is hazardous because it is heavier than air and displaces it, so it may flow down a river valley to human settlements and cause mass asphyxiation. The material at the bottom of a lake, or lake bed, may be composed of a wide variety of inorganics, such as silt or sand, and organic material, such as decaying plant or animal matter. The composition of the lake bed has a significant impact on the flora and fauna found within the lake's environs by contributing to the amounts and the types of nutrients available. A paired (black and white) layer of the varved lake sediments correspond to a year. During winter, when organisms die, carbon is deposited down, resulting to a black layer. At the same year, during summer, only few organic materials are deposited, resulting to a white layer at the lake bed. These are commonly used to track past paleontological events. Natural lakes provide a microcosm of living and nonliving elements that are relatively independent of their surrounding environments. Therefore, lake organisms can often be studied in isolation from the lake's surroundings.Forbes, Stephen. \\"The Lake as a Microcosm\\" . \\"Bulletin of the Peoria Scientific Association\\" vol. 87, 1887. pp. 77‚Äì87.  Limnology  Lur√´ Mountains glacial lakes, Albania Limnology is the study of inland bodies of water and related ecosystems. Limnology divides lakes into three zones: the littoral zone, a sloped area close to land; the photic or open-water zone, where sunlight is abundant; and the deep-water profundal or benthic zone, where little sunlight can reach. The depth to which light can reach in lakes depends on turbidity, determined by the density and size of suspended particles. A particle is in suspension if its weight is less than the random turbidity forces acting upon it. These particles can be sedimentary or biological in origin and are responsible for the color of the water. Decaying plant matter, for instance, may be responsible for a yellow or brown color, while algae may cause greenish water. In very shallow water bodies, iron oxides make water reddish brown. Biological particles include algae and detritus. Bottom-dwelling detritivorous fish can be responsible for turbid waters, because they stir the mud in search of food. Piscivorous fish contribute to turbidity by eating plant-eating (planktonivorous) fish, thus increasing the amount of algae (see aquatic trophic cascade). The light depth or transparency is measured by using a Secchi disk, a 20-cm (8 in) disk with alternating white and black quadrants. The depth at which the disk is no longer visible is the Secchi depth, a measure of transparency. The Secchi disk is commonly used to test for eutrophication. For a detailed look at these processes, see lentic ecosystems. A lake moderates the surrounding region's temperature and climate because water has a very high specific heat capacity (4,186 J¬∑kg‚àí1¬∑K‚àí1). In the daytime a lake can cool the land beside it with local winds, resulting in a sea breeze; in the night it can warm it with a land breeze.  Circulation   Disappearance  Ephemeral 'Lake Badwater', a lake only noted after heavy winter and spring rainfall, Badwater Basin, Death Valley National Park, 9 February 2005. Landsat 5 satellite photo Badwater Basin dry lake, 15 February 2007. Landsat 5 satellite photo The lake may be infilled with deposited sediment and gradually become a wetland such as a swamp or marsh. Large water plants, typically reeds, accelerate this closing process significantly because they partially decompose to form peat soils that fill the shallows. Conversely, peat soils in a marsh can naturally burn and reverse this process to recreate a shallow lake resulting in a dynamic equilibrium between marsh and lake.Ponds and Lakes. Lessons from Biologists. aquahabitat.com This is significant since wildfire has been largely suppressed in the developed world over the past century. This has artificially converted many shallow lakes into emergent marshes. Turbid lakes and lakes with many plant-eating fish tend to disappear more slowly. A \\"disappearing\\" lake (barely noticeable on a human timescale) typically has extensive plant mats at the water's edge. These become a new habitat for other plants, like peat moss when conditions are right, and animals, many of which are very rare. Gradually, the lake closes and young peat may form, forming a fen. In lowland river valleys where a river can meander, the presence of peat is explained by the infilling of historical oxbow lakes. In the very last stages of succession, trees can grow in, eventually turning the wetland into a forest. Some lakes can disappear seasonally. These are called intermittent lakes, ephemeral lakes, or seasonal lakes and can be found in karstic terrain. A prime example of an intermittent lake is Lake Cerknica in Slovenia or Lag Prau Pulte in Graub√ºnden. Other intermittent lakes are only the result of above-average precipitation in a closed, or endorheic basin, usually filling dry lake beds. This can occur in some of the driest places on earth, like Death Valley. This occurred in the spring of 2005, after unusually heavy rains.Chadwick, Alex (3 March 2005) Wet Winter Brings Life to Death Valley. NPR.org The lake did not last into the summer, and was quickly evaporated (see photos to right). A more commonly filled lake of this type is Sevier Lake of west-central Utah. Sometimes a lake will disappear quickly. On 3 June 2005, in Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, Russia, a lake called Lake Beloye vanished in a matter of minutes. News sources reported that government officials theorized that this strange phenomenon may have been caused by a shift in the soil underneath the lake that allowed its water to drain through channels leading to the Oka River.The Montana Standard The presence of ground permafrost is important to the persistence of some lakes. Thawing permafrost may explain the shrinking or disappearance of hundreds of large Arctic lakes across western Siberia. The idea here is that rising air and soil temperatures thaw permafrost, allowing the lakes to drain away into the ground. Some lakes disappear because of human development factors. The shrinking Aral Sea is described as being \\"murdered\\" by the diversion for irrigation of the rivers feeding it.  Extraterrestrial lakes  Titan's north polar hydrocarbon seas and lakes as seen in a false-color Cassini synthetic aperture radar mosaic Only one world other than Earth is known to harbor large lakes, Saturn's largest moon, Titan. Photographs and spectroscopic analysis by the Cassini‚ÄìHuygens spacecraft show liquid ethane on the surface, which is thought to be mixed with liquid methane. The largest Titanean lake, Kraken Mare at 400,000 km2, is three-times the size of any lake on Earth, and even the second, Ligeia Mare, is estimated to be slightly larger than Earth's Lake Michigan‚ÄìHuron. Jupiter's large moon Io is volcanically active, and as a result sulfur deposits have accumulated on the surface. Some photographs taken during the Galileo mission appear to show lakes of liquid sulfur in volcanic caldera, though these are more analogous to lake of lava than of water on Earth. The planet Mars has only one confirmed lake; it is underground and near the south pole. However, the surface of Mars is too cold and has too little atmospheric pressure to permit permanent surface water. Geologic evidence appears to confirm, however, that ancient lakes once formed on the surface. It is also possible that volcanic activity on Mars will occasionally melt subsurface ice, creating large temporary lakes. This water would quickly freeze and then sublimate, unless insulated in some manner, such as by a coating of volcanic ash. There are dark basaltic plains on the Moon, similar to lunar maria but smaller, that are called lacus (singular lacus, Latin for \\"lake\\") because they were thought by early astronomers to be lakes of water.  Notable lakes on Earth  The Caspian Sea is either the world's largest lake or a full-fledged seaThe Caspian Sea is generally regarded by geographers, biologists and limnologists as a huge inland salt lake. However, the Caspian's large size means that for some purposes it is better modeled as a sea. Geologically, the Caspian, Black and Mediterranean seas are remnants of the ancient Tethys Ocean. Politically, the distinction between a sea and a lake may affect how the Caspian is treated by international law. Round Tangle Lake, one of the Tangle Lakes, 2,864 feet (873 m) above sea level in interior Alaska * The largest lake by surface area is Caspian Sea, which is despite its name considered as a lake from the point of view of geography. Its surface area is 143,000 sq. mi./371,000 km2. * The second largest lake by surface area, and the largest freshwater lake by surface area, is Lake Michigan-Huron, which is hydrologically a single lake. Its surface area is 45,300 sq. mi./117,400 km2. For those who consider Lake Michigan-Huron to be separate lakes, and Caspian Sea to be a sea, Lake Superior would be the largest lake at 82,100 km2 (31,700 square miles) * Lake Baikal is the deepest lake in the world, located in Siberia, with a bottom at . Its mean depth is also the greatest in the world (). It is also the world's largest freshwater lake by volume (, but much smaller than the Caspian Sea at ), and the second longest (about from tip to tip). * The world's oldest lake is Lake Baikal, followed by Lake Tanganyika in Tanzania. Lake Maracaibo is considered by some to be the second-oldest lake on Earth, but since it lies at sea level and nowadays is a contiguous body of water with the sea, others consider that it has turned into a small bay. * The longest lake is Lake Tanganyika, with a length of about (measured along the lake's center line). It is also the third largest by volume, the second oldest, and the second deepest () in the world, after Lake Baikal. * The world's highest lake, if size is not a criterion, may be the crater lake of Ojos del Salado, at .Ojos del Salado 6893m. andes.org.uk * The highest large (greater than ) lake in the world is the Pumoyong Tso (Pumuoyong Tso), in the Tibet Autonomous Region of China, at 28-34N 90-24E, above sea level. * The world's highest commercially navigable lake is Lake Titicaca in Peru and Bolivia at . It is also the largest lake in South America. * The world's lowest lake is the Dead Sea, bordered by Jordan to the east and Israel and Palestine to the west, at below sea level. It is also one of the lakes with highest salt concentration. * Lake Michigan‚ÄìHuron has the longest lake coastline in the world: about , excluding the coastline of its many inner islands. Even if it is considered two lakes, Lake Huron alone would still have the longest coastline in the world at . * The largest island in a lake is Manitoulin Island in Lake Michigan-Huron, with a surface area of .

Before the current city boundaries came into effect in 2001, this status was held by Lake Ramsey, also in Sudbury. * Lake Enriquillo in Dominican Republic is the only saltwater lake in the world inhabited by crocodiles. * Lake Bernard, Ontario, Canada, claims to be the largest lake in the world with no islands. * The largest lake in one country is Lake Michigan, in the United States. However, it is sometimes considered part of Lake Michigan-Huron, making the record go to Great Bear Lake, Northwest Territories, in Canada, the largest lake within one jurisdiction. * The largest lake on an island in a lake on an island is Crater Lake on Vulcano Island in Lake Taal on the island of Luzon, The Philippines. * The northernmost named lake on Earth is Upper Dumbell Lake in the Qikiqtaaluk Region of Nunavut, Canada at a latitude of 82¬∞28'N. It is southwest of Alert, the northernmost settlement in the world. There are also several small lakes north of Upper Dumbell Lake, but they are all unnamed and only appear on very detailed maps.  Largest by continent  The largest lakes (surface area) by continent are: * Australia ‚Äì Lake Eyre (salt lake) * Africa ‚Äì Lake Victoria, also the third-largest freshwater lake on Earth. It is one of the Great Lakes of Africa. * Antarctica ‚Äì Lake Vostok (subglacial) * Asia ‚Äì Lake Baikal (if the Caspian Sea is considered a lake, it is the largest in Eurasia, but is divided between the two geographic continents) * Oceania ‚Äì Lake Eyre when filled; the largest permanent (and freshwater) lake in Oceania is Lake Taupo. * Europe ‚Äì Lake Ladoga, followed by Lake Onega, both in northwestern Russia. * North America ‚Äì Lake Michigan-Huron, which is hydrologically a single lake. However, lakes Huron and Michigan are usually considered separate lakes, in which case Lake Superior would be the largest. * South America ‚Äì Lake Titicaca, which is also the highest navigable body of water on Earth at above sea level. The much larger Lake Maracaibo is much older, but perceived by some to no longer be genuinely a lake for multiple reasons.

Both Yakans and Tausugs are predominantly Muslim, joined by their kin from the Sama, Badjao, Maranao, and other Muslim ethnolinguistic groups of Mindanao, while the Zamboangue√±os are primarily Christian, joined by the predominantly Christian ethnolinguistic groups; the Cebuano, Ilocano, Tagalog and others. These three main groups, however, represent Basilan's tri-people or tri-ethnic group community. Yakan Wedding dance of a Yakan couple in their traditional costume. The island is the homeland of the Yakans, a Filipino ethnic group or ethnolinguistic group widely regarded as having been descended from Orang Dampuans (Orang Dyaks, Tagihamas) of the Kingdom of Champa and eastern Indonesia, and recognized for their colorful costume. The Yakan have designs or motifs used repeatedly in all their visual arts and crafts. The pussuk labbung is a sawtooth design used for cloth baskets and the native sword called kris. The bunga sama, used for table runners, monuments for the dead and on trunks, is a symmetrical design made of rectangular-shaped figures. The kabban buddi is a set of triangles, squares, and other geometric shapes used for cushions, pillows, casings, mats, and hats. The baggang kettan combines incised triangles and rectangles, and is used to decorate the kris. The ukil lagbas consists of a combination of various lines ‚Äì wavy, crossed-wavy, and straight ‚Äì used on shirts, windows of houses, and boats (Sherfan 1976:210‚Äì211). Weapons such as knives and swords are part of the Yakan's visual arts. The punnyal is a small knife, which can be hidden within one's clothing. The taming is the traditional shield used along with two types of spears, the budjak and the sankil, now used only in war dances. The bangkung is another type of bolo seldom used nowadays. The pira is a traditional weapon used by little boys when going on a long journey. The barong and the kalis, although popular, are less valuable or admired among the Yakan (Sherfan 1976:156‚Äì160). The pira, a Yakan sword with the characteristic highly elongated kakatua pommel Yakan visual arts includes Yakan kitchen utensils and household implements. Metalware includes the talam, a beautifully decorated bronze tray, and the sanduk or ladle used for special occasions. Yakan basketry is both colorful and functional. The tutop is a food cover made of bamboo leaves. The peliyuk is a clay jar with cover used for cooking. The baling is a decorative clay jar treasured as heirloom. The kombo is a lidded container for rice storage. A lakal is a bamboo frame used to hold the cooking gadget when placed on the ground. The tempipih is a big basket carried on the back. A conical basket called the saan is used as a liquid strainer. Baskets are also used to measure and weigh. The gantang is bigger than the government ganta. The batil measures nine gantang. The laga is 10 gantang. The ilug is 30 gantang. The lukung is equivalent to 100 gantang. An example of Yakan pottery is the poga, a covered clay jar used as water container (Sherfan 1976:201‚Äì204). Yakan cloth on display at the Isabela City Pasalubong Center and at the Lami-Lamihan Yakan Center in Lamitan, Basilan Yakan women are excellent weavers, and are famous for their beautifully woven traditional costumes of cotton and pineapple cloth. The basic garment for men and women consists of a tight-fitting upper garment with tight-fitting trousers called sawal. The shirt is open in front from lapel down to the waist, using up to 40 sequined or golden buttons. To close the shirt, a long string is crisscrossed from one button to the other so that when tightly drawn, the shirt closes from top to bottom. Usually, the shirt remains open since the string is often lost. Over the shirt, male and female wear a tight- fitting jacket, which is exquisitely embroidered in the front and back, with cuffs decorated with multicolored sequins. The difference in male and female apparel lies in accessories. Men wear a hand-woven pis (head cloth) and a 15-m-long kandit (belt or sash) made of red cloth called gilim. The pis serves as \\"protection\\" from spears and knives during combat, and may be fastened around the trousers. The women wear a short skirt over the trousers, around which a rectangular, hand woven cloth is tied. This cloth is the most expensive part of their costume because it is woven in a tedious manner. Men and women wear the saruk, the Yakan hat worn to make one look more attractive and elegant. Some wear the hat over the turban and use it as a purse for betel nuts, tobacco, and money. Yakan warriors wear a bulletproof shirt prepared by hadjis and imams who write Arabic script all over the shirt (Sherfan 1976:160, 205‚Äì207). Ornaments such as necklaces may be worn as charms. A crocodile tooth polished with a hole at the base is believed to bring good luck when worn as a necklace. The Yakan also wear amulets against bullets. These contain unreadable symbols, are wrapped in black cloth, sewn in triangular form, and tied around the neck. Belts made of snake bones are strung together to protect them against bodily pain. One charm that protects them from sicknesses due to evil spirits is the manik tegiyas ‚Äì a necklace or bracelet made of the fruits of a flower beaded together. The manik sembulan is made of a bamboo stem cut into short pieces, strung together either as a necklace or bracelet, and serving as added protection against sickness inflicted by evil spirits. To gain more strength against evil spirits, men and women wear the anting-anting. This consists of a string with a piece of cloth containing beads as pendant (Sherfan 1976:143‚Äì147). The Yakan also wear functional gadgets. The pegupaan is a bamboo container for all the paraphernalia for chewing betel nut. The lutuan, a small bronze box with engravings carried at the waist, has a similar function (Sherfan 1976:203). A unique form of visual arts is the facial make- up done on brides and grooms. After creating a foundation of white powder, the make-up artists proceed to paint dots and lines in various patterns on the faces, creating the effect of formal and elaborate masks which match the ornate costumes of the celebrants. The Yakan have a rich musical tradition, which may be broadly divided into instrumental and vocal. Yakan musical instruments are made of bamboo, wood, and metal. Their musical instruments also demonstrate the influence of the traditional cycle of rice production in their lives. Several instruments are used in each stage of rice production. The daluppak is a digging stick with a bamboo clapper. The kopak-kopak is a bamboo clapper on a stick. The Kwintangan Kayu is percussion instrument consisting of wooden beams laid after the planting season, to enhance plant growth. The wooden tuntungan is a percussion plank with jar resonators, also played during the harvest season for thanksgiving. The gabbang is a bamboo split into five, and arranged like a xylophone. Small children near the fields played it in order to guard the crops against prying animals. The kwintangan batakan is an earlier form of gabbang which has six, seven, or nine bamboo pieces. The suling is a bamboo mouth flute used by the men in courting women. Another bamboo instrument used by the men in expressing love or admiration is the kulaing. The Kulintangan or kwintangan consists of several bronze gongs arranged according to size, and used during celebrations such as weddings and graduations. Any individual played it in the home and after work, for self- expression and relaxation. The agong is a percussion instrument used to announce marriage or for tolling the dead. The jabujabu (djabu-djabu) is a type of drum that summons the people to prayer (Nicolas 1977: 100‚Äì108; Sherfan 1976:195‚Äì199). There are three main types of Yakan vocal music: the lugu and other melodies used in reading the Quran and other religious books; the kalangan or songs which may be further reclassified into Jamiluddin and Lunsey; and the katakata, nahana, yaya, lembukayu, and sa-il, among others. The kalangan, jamiluddin, katakata, nahana, and yaya are sung solo, while the lunsey, sa-il, meglubulebu seputangen, and lembukayu involves singers from two groups singing solo as they answer each other. The kalangan, jamiluddin, lunsey, and lembukayu are courting songs. The katakata, jamiluddin, and nahana may also narrate the history of the Yakan people. The katakata is a long traditional song narrating the lives, loves, and historical backgrounds of people who lived during early times. The Yakan believed that such stories originated from people who lived in another world. The katakata is sung only at night, at a big gathering with food served by the host or hostess. The singing, in episodes, may last for several nights. The singer lies on a mat, the back supported by several pillows. The audience, either sit or lie around the singer. The jamiluddin relates love stories. At present, it is also sung when families discuss marriage engagements. Both the katakata and jamiluddin are sung by wise men and women of the tribe. The sa-il and lunsey are sung during a wedding ceremony, with messages revolving around good advice regarding married life. Another type of sa-il is sung during the magtammat or Quranic graduation. During social gatherings, the maglebu-lebu seputangan is sung, by a group of men answering a group of women. Each group has a soloist who sings the kalangan, expressed in metaphors. The yaya is a lullaby. The magsambag is a method of studying the Quran in which a Murid or student follows the Quranic singing of the teacher. The student and teacher are not allowed to sing together. Then there are the songs, which the Yakan sing during daily activities. In keeping watch over rice fields, they sing some forms of the jamiluddin and kalangan. While resting at home, they also leisurely sing the katakata, jamiluddin, and nahana. Children at play imitate the adults in singing the kalangan, jamiluddin, lembukayu, and lugu (Nicolas 1977:97‚Äì100). One popular Yakan dance adopted from the Tausugs Pangalay is called mangalay. The dance is accompanied by the kunlintangan kayu and played by three people. In the Yakan \\"bumblebee\\" mimetic dance usually performed by a male dancer, a searcher successfully finds honey with the aid of a torch. He overeats, and the result is a stomachache (Orosa-Goquingco 1980:175). Another example of a mimetic dance is the tahing baila, which imitates the movement of a fish (Tiongson 1991:236). At weddings, the tumahik or war dance is to be performed by the groom as well as male relatives of both the groom and the bride. Dressed in Yakan finery, the dancer uses a spear and a shield to fight an imaginary enemy to the music of the kulintangan. Tausug A Tausug child vendor selling piyutu (traditional steamed tapioca cylinders) The Tausug are the Yakan's traditional rivals in the Sulu Archipelago. Based primarily in the island of Jolo, the Tausug built a powerful maritime confederation of Datus and Rajas extending from the Sulu Archipelago to Palawan and North Borneo. They inhabit Basilan's coastal areas, specifically around the island's southwest and northwestern communities. Known to be fierce warriors and sailors throughout the 16th to the 19th centuries, they withstood Spanish incursions for over 350 years, succumbing only in 1876, and then to the Americans in 1915. \\"Tausug\\" derives from tau meaning \\"man\\" and sug meaning \\"current,\\" and translates into \\"people of the current.\\" It refers to the majority Islamized group in the Sulu archipelago, their language, and culture. The Tausug, are predominant in the northern part of Sulu province, i.e., Jolo Island and the neighboring islands of Pata, Marunggas, Tapul, and Lugus, and to a lesser extent in Siasi and Pangutaran (Arce 1963:3). The province of Sulu derives its name from sulug or s≈´g which in Tausug means \\"ocean current,\\" while Sulu's capital Jolo is the Spanish corruption of Sulu. The Tausug speak Bahasa S≈´g, a Malayo-Polynesian language related to the Visayan variety spoken in Surigao, and write in a Malayo-Arabic script known as Jawi or sulat s≈´g. Tausug visual arts are represented by carvings, metalworks, woodworks, tapestry and embroidery, mat making and basketry, textile and fashion, pottery, and other minor arts (Szanton 1963). In general, Tausug visual arts follow the Islamic prohibition of representing human or animal forms. Consequently, Mindanao and Sulu have developed ukkil or abstract motifs which are carved, printed, or painted into various media. These motifs are suggestive of leaves, vines, flowers, fruits, and various geometric shapes. Tausug carving is best exemplified by the sunduk or grave marker. Although not as stylized as those of the Samal, the Tausug sunduk are wood or stone carvings of geometric or floral forms. Women's grave markers are flatter with carved geometric designs, those of the men are more floral. Sakayan or outriggers present yet another media for Tausug carving. Adornments are usually made on the prow and sometimes on the sambili or strips across the hull. The carvings are done either on the boat itself, or on a separate piece of wood which is then attached to the vessel. Abstract manok-manok (bird) motifs are the most common. Ajong-ajong/sula-sula are carved tips supporting the wrapped sail; the hidjuk (dark cord) on the sangpad (prow-plate) also serve as decoration. Carved saam or cross‚Äîpieces supporting the outriggers are called the mata (eyes) of the boat. Colors used on the finished carvings are yellow, red, green, white, and blue (Szanton 1973:33‚Äì47). The most common Taus≈´g weapons: the kalis and the barong with the characteristic Taus≈´g kakatua (cockatoo) pommel design Tausug mananasal or blacksmiths produce bolo, kalis, and barong (bladed weapons). Fishing implem-ents are also made, such as the sangkil (single-pointed spear) and the sapang (three-pronged spear). The more expensively fashioned blades have floral and geometric incisions; the ganja or metal strips which lock the handle and the blade are a decorative as well a functional device. Bronze casting is not as well developed as it is in Lanao. Among the several functional pieces produced were the batunjang (standing trays) and the talam (flat trays). Gold and silver-smithing for jewelry remain lucrative. Items produced by the local goldsmith include the singsing (ring), gallang (bracelet), gantung liug (necklace), bang (stud earring), aritis (dangling earring), pin (brooch), and gold teeth. In the past, tambuku (buttons) made of gold or silver decorated the traditional male and female costumes and were made with exquisite designs, often inlaid with palmata (semiprecious stones or gems). Among the favorite palmata are mussah (pearl), intan (diamond), kumalah (ruby) (Szanton 1973:47‚Äì51; Amilbangsa 1983:142‚Äì157). An example of Tausug woodwork is the puhan (wooden handle) of bladed weapons which may be simple or decorated with gold or silver wires, strings, and rings. For the barong, the handle is wrapped in cord and metal at the far end, and carved and polished at the upper part. At the end of the grip is a protrusion carved with ukkil designs. The handle of the kalis, which the Tausug terms as daganan kalis, can also be profusely decorated, sometimes with mother-of-pearl. Taguban (scabbards) are beautifully carved and are covered with budbud (fine rattan). Other woodworks include kitchen utensils and furniture items like beds, chests, and wardrobes (Szanton 1973:51‚Äì54). There are two types of tapestries that the Tausug use to hang as house decoration: the luhul or canopy that hangs from the ceiling, and the kikitil/buras or wall tapestry. The ukkil design used for both is first traced on a starched white cloth which is then cut and sewn over a red, green, yellow, or blue background material. The ukkil design of the luhul, for example, is in the form of a tree with spreading leaves, vines, flowers, and branches. About 1 m wide, the kikitil is a smaller version of the luhul and is hung on the wall. The size of the room determines the length of the kikitil which is divided into various units corresponding to individualized panels. The ukkil design may be similar in all units. A Pis siyabit (headscarf) made of silk and tapestry weave at the Honolulu Museum of Art. Embroidery, another Tausug visual art form, is used to ornament tablecloth, pillow cases, bed spreads, and the habul tiyahian (embroidered tube). The brightest silk thread is often used for the habul to underscore the design, which follows the ukkil pattern. Used as bedding or underbedding, baluy or mats are usually made from pandanus. Double layering provides decoration and color; a simple base mat is sewn under a colored panel which has been dyed with one or more colors. The designs the Tausug usually adopt are the geometric patterns found on the pis siabit (male headgear) or the plaid known as baluy palang. Mat designs are memorized and passed on to the next generation. The Tausug male hat is made by weaving nito with bamboo strips over nipa leaves. Thus it is three-layered and woven in a sawali pattern. Structure and form are provided by the nipa leaves and the light bamboo frame, while texture and feel are supplied by the nito strips. The open-weave layer assures ventilation inside. Another example of Tausug basketry is the small nito container, 18‚Äì20 cm in diameter, used either as a coin or as a personal basket. If used as a personal basket, it comes with cover and handle. As a coin basket, it is supplied with a loop to allow it to be carried on a finger. A slit serves as the coin slot. Aniline dyes-magenta, blue, violet, and green-color the nito strips (Lane 1986:193-194). Hablun or textile weaving is another well-known art form among the Tausug. The most popular woven material is the pis siabit or male headgear, which is about 1 sqm in size and distinct for its geometric designs. Because of its intricacy, one pis takes about three to four weeks of work. Only women weave the pis and other materials such as the kambut (sash) and kandit (loincloth and sash), which unfortunately have completely disappeared (Szanton 1973:6.4‚Äì65). The female biyatawi is a blouse made of plain material like satin and is ornamented with tambuku (gold or silver buttons) on the breast, shoulders, and cuffs. It is usually worn with sawwal (loose trousers) of silk or brocade. A habul tiyahian is either slung across the shoulder or allowed to hang on one arm (Amilbangsa 1983:76‚Äì113). The patadjung is an all-purpose skirt worn by both men and women. It has various other uses: as a turung or headcover, sash or waistband, blanket, ham-mock, and others. Resembling a big pillow case, the cloth for a patadjung has designs which are variously inspired: batik prints from Indonesia and Malaysia, checks and stripes from India, dunggala or stylized geometrical and floral patterns from Sarawak, Indone-sia, or Malaysia, calligraphic motifs from the Middle East (Amilbangsa 1983:82). Tausug men wear the sawwal kuput or sawwal kantiyu (tight and loose trousers respectively), and match this with the badju lapi, a collarless short-tailored jacket similar to the biyatawi. The sleeves of the badju lapi are either long or \\"three-fourth's\\" with slits at the wrists. The badju lapi is likewise ornamented with tambuku on the breast, shoulders, and cuffs. The legs of the sawwal kaput are skin-tight down to the ankles, and have 22.5 cm slits on each side, which are also decorated with buttons. A kandit (handwoven or embroidered sash) tied around the waist serves to keep the sawwal kuput in place. A pis siabit is either tied around the head or left to hang on the shoulder (Amilbangsa 1983:114‚Äì130). Function and simplicity define Tausug pottery. Decorations are limited to simple geometric lines as the emphasis has always been on the quantity not quality of the product. Examples include pots, vases, jugs, and various pieces of kitchenware (Szanton 1973: 61‚Äì63). Tutup or plate covers are made by Tausug men and women; smaller pieces are called turung dulang riki-riki, and are used as wall adornment. Tutup mea-sure about 75 cm in diameter and are made of coconut leaves inside, and silal or buri leaves outside. Colored pandan leaves are sewn on the exterior and serve as decoration (Szanton 1973:64). Calligraphy is found printed or carved on doors and gates, as well as on tapestries. Musical instruments, especially the gabbang (native xylophone), are also decorated by the Tausug (Szanton 1973:65). Tausug women in a traditional Tausug fan dance, Kinding sindaw. Various musical instruments, played solo or as an ensemble, provide the Tausug with music. Most notable is the kulintangan ensemble consisting of two gandang (drums), a tungallan (large gong), a duwahan (set of two-paired gongs), and the kulintangan (a graduated series of 8 to 11 small gongs). At least five players are needed to play the ensemble which is used to accompany dances or provide music during celebra-tions (Kiefer 1970:2). Other popular instruments are the gabbang (na-tive xylophone) and the biyula (native violin). With 14 to 24 keys divided into seven-note scales, the gabbang has become the most popular musical instrument in Sulu. It is used to accompany Tausug vocal music such as the sindil. The tune produced when the gabbang is played solo by a man or woman is called tahtah. The biyula is similar to but larger than the western violin. It consists of four strings played by a bow made of horsehair. Traditionally played by men, the biyula, with the gabbang, accompany the sindil (Kiefer 1970:2) Flute music is associated with peace and travel. It represented by the following less popular instruments: the saunay (reed flute), suling (bamboo flute), and kulaing (jaw harp). The saunay is essentially a six-holed slender bamboo, 1.5 mm in diameter, capped by a sampung simud (mouthguard). A resonating chamber made of palm leaves is housed in the mouthguard. The suling is a larger version of the saunay. It is a 60-cm long bamboo with a 2-cm diameter. Like the saunay, it has six fingerholes (Kiefer 1970:4). The repertoire for Tausug instrumental music include: the gabbang tahtah (gabbang with biyula accompaniment); the kasi-lasa, lugu, and tahtah (biyula songs); the sinug kiadtu-kari (kulintangan); the tiawag kasi (saunay music), the tahtah (suling music); and others (Kiefer 1970). Kalangan or Tausug vocal music can be divided into narrative and lyric songs, and further into the lugu and the paggabang traditions. The luguh tradition denotes unaccompanied religious songs, while the paggabang tradition applies to \\"more mundane\\" songs that are accompanied by the gabbang and biyula (Trimillos 1972). Narrative songs tell a story and include all the sung kissa like the parang sabil. Lyric songs express ideas and feelings and consist of the langan batabata (children's songs), the baat (occupational songs), the baat caallaw and pangantin (funeral and bridal songs, respectively), the tarasul (sung poems), the sindil (sung verbal jousts), the liangkit (from langkit or \\"chained\\"), and the sangbay or song to accompany the dalling- dalling dance. The langan batabata are more specifically lullabies. They have a soft and relaxing melody (Tuban 1977:210). Baat and kalangan are the same, the latter being the more general term to refer to singing. The baat taallaw have a melancholic melody. The baat pangantin are also known as langan pangantin. With a soothing melody, they are used to reassure a bride and to console a friend (Rixhon 1974a:51). The sindil (sung verbal jousts) belong to the gabbang tradition and are performed by both sexes conducting an extemporaneous battle of wits. Teasing, jokes, and innuendos flow into the verses, the better ones applauded by the audience (Kiefer 1970: 10). The liangkit are long solo pieces accompanied by the gabbang and biyula. Unlike the sindil, they are not performed extemporaneously. The subject of the liangkit is wide-love, war, nature, and others. The Tausug lelling, adopted from the Samal, are part of the liangkit tradition, but are sung to the music provided by a guitar. They relate and comment on current events. One good ex- ample is the lelling narrating the entry of the Moro National Liberation Front forces into Jolo town in February 1974. The art of singing to the dalling- dalling dance is called pagsangbay. The song usually dictates the movement that the dancers should follow. The lugu or sail tradition is associated with religious rituals and rites of the life cycle such as wed-dings, births, paggunting, pagtammat, and funerals. It is characterized by dahig or jugjug (high vocal tension). The tempo is slow with long sustained and stressed tones. Although usually performed by women, the lugu can also be sung by men (Trimillos 1974). A group of folk dancers performing the traditional Pangalay dance. The most well-known dance of the Tausug is the pangalay. It is the basic style from which the movements of various dances in Sulu and Tawi-Tawi are derived. The pangalay is danced by either sex, alone or together, and is usually accompanied by the kulintang ensemble. The movement of the pangalay is concentrated on the thighs, knees, ankles, toes, waist, shoulders, neck, elbows, wrists, and fingers. The torso is usually kept rigid, moving upward or downward as the flow of the dance demands. The feet is firmly planted on the ground and move in small shuffling steps (Amilbangsa 1983:14, 62). The pangalay dances are distinctive in their use of the janggay (metal nail extenders) to underscore hand movements. The extended fingers are stiff and set apart from the thumbs. Another well-known Tausug dance is the dalling‚Äîdalling, where handkerchiefs or fans are used. A sing-er usually accompanies the dance by describing the various movements of the dancer. The song is known as the sangbay and the singing. pagsangbay. Some of the songs used are \\"Lingisan/kinjung-kinjung,\\" \\"Dalling-dalling\\". The development of the dalling‚Äîdalling is attributed to a native Tausug by the name of Albani who became a famous proponent of the dance (Amilbangsa 1983:42). Tausug martial- art dances are performed by men and include the langka-silat and the langka- kuntaw. The langka-silat simulates a fight and is usually per-formed with two or three other dancers. The langka‚Äîkuntaw is a dance of self-defense, resembling the martial arts of China, Japan, and Burma (Amilbangsa 1983:32‚Äì35). A Tausug occupational dance is the linggisan which depicts a bird in flight; the taute, which shows a fisher diving for the prickly catfish; and the suwa‚Äîsuwa, which shows dancers imitating the swaying of lemon trees (Amilbangsa 1983:28). Zamboangue√±o Jota Zamboangue√±a, traditional Zamboangue√±o dance Zamboangue√±o Chavacano, also variously known as Zamboangue√±o, has been known for quite to be both a Castilian-based creole language and an ethnolinguistic nation or ethnolinguistic group born officially on June 23, 1635. It is also one of the six (6) dialects of Chavacano. Some of which like the Viasayan Chavacano, have already died off just a few years after the surrender of the Spanish. Chabacano in Luzon stayed on a little longer. These are found in the Ermita district of Manila known as Ermitense dialect (Spanish Criollo), Cavite City known as Cavite√± dialect (Spanish and Tagalog) and Ternate known as Bahra dialect (Spanish-Portuguese, Tagalog and Malay). These Chavacano speakers, were decimated during the Japanese occupation, easy targets because of their lighter skin and obviously Western tongue. The Chavacanos de Zamboanga o Zamboangue√±o, however, are rooted in the Spanish-Jesuit settlement that grew around Fuerte de San Jose established in 1635. The Zamboangue√±o Chavacano of today is the result of centuries of cultural interaction and intermarriage between and among three (3) main racial/ethnic groups: (1) Visayan, specifically the original 1,000 Cebuanos brought in from Cebu to build the Spanish fortress (as well as the many Cebuanos and Ilongos who followed soon after), (2) the Christianized natives, mostly Subanen, Tau Laut (Samal) and Yakan converted and tended to by the enterprising Jesuits; and (3) Castilians (Spaniards, Mexicans and Peruvians). Later infusions by other languages such as Ilocanos Tagalogs, Sama, Badjau, Suluanon Tausug, et al. in the country and around the world further enriched the Zamboangue√±o Chavacano language. Of all these, the Spanish culture had the strongest impact ‚Äì about 80% of Zamboangue√±o culture is anchored on Espa√±a and its three centuries of presence. The greatest number of Zamboangue√±o profess the Catholic faith, hewing closely to their avowedly Hispanic heritage. The Zamboangue√±os inhabit the northern coasts of the island, mostly residing in the urban centers of Isabela and Lamitan cities, they are joined by other Christian ethnolinguistic groups in these areas, usually the Bisaya Sugbuanon (Cebuano), Bisaya-Ilonggo, Ilocano and Tagalog. They own most of the agricultural lands on the island, and is the group with the highest literacy, highest per capita incomes, and lowest poverty incidence on the island. Zamboangue√±o courtship traditions are elaborate and regulated by a long list of required social graces. For example, a perfectly respectable Zamboangue√±o gentleman would not sit unless permitted to do so by the woman‚Äôs parents, he then had to endure questions pertaining to his lineage, credentials, and occupation. Finally, the courtship curfew, and the need to cultivate the goodwill of all the members of the woman‚Äôs family were paramount considerations before any headway could be made in pursuing a Zamboangue√±a senorita's hand in marriage. Zamboangue√±o songs and dances are derived primarily from Spanish/Iberian performances. Specifically, the Jota Zamboangue√±a, a Zamboangue√±o version of the quick-stepping flamenco with bamboo clappers in lieu of Spanish castanets, are regularly presented during fiestas and formal \\"tertulias\\" or other Zamboangue√±o festivities. Likewise, Zamboangue√±o traditional costumes are closely associated with Spanish formal dress. Men wear close-necked jackets, \\"de baston\\" pants, and European style shoes, complete with the de rigueur \\"bigotillos\\" (mustache). More recently, Chavacano men have adapted to wearing the formal Barong Tagalog, worn by men throughout the Philippines. Zamboangue√±o women claim ownership of the \\"mascota\\", a formal gown with a fitting bodice, her shoulders draped demurely by a luxuriously embroidered, though stiff, panuelo and fastened at the breast by a brooch or a medal. The skirt tapers down from the waist but continues on to an extended trail called the \\"cola\\". The \\"cola may be held on one hand as the lady walks around, or it may likewise by pinned on the waist or slipped up a cord (belt) that holds the dainty \\"abanico\\" or purse. Of late, the Zamboangue√±os de Basilan have acquired more modern tastes in food, clothing and customs, usually based on the generally preferred American/Western model. The traditional Zamboangue√±o dress has been limited to formal functions, replaced by the more common shirt, denim jeans and sneakers for men, and shirts, blouses, skirts or pants, and heeled shoes for women. Likewise, Taglish, a mix of Tagalog and English is increasingly accepted as a modern and convenient variant of either the more difficult (for Zamboangue√±o) Tagalog or the more formal English. An even more confusing mix of Tag-lish and Zamboangue√±o Chavacano is likewise spoken especially by the younger generations of Zamboangue√±o.

Greece (which had gained its independence in 1832) and Italy established diplomatic relations in 1861, immediately upon Italy's unification.\\"18 aprile 1861: Grecia\\" Documents on the establishment of diplomatic relationships with Italy Italian philhellenes had contributed to the Greek independence, such as the jurist Vincenzo Gallina, Annibale Santorre di Rossi de Pomarolo, Count of Santarosa and Giuseppe Rosaroll. Throughout the 19th century, Italian philhellenes continued to support Greece politically and militarily. For example, Ricciotti Garibaldi led a volunteer expedition (Garibaldini) in the Greco-Turkish War of 1897.Gilles P√©cout, \\"Philhellenism in Italy: political friendship and the Italian volunteers in the Mediterranean in the nineteenth century\\", Journal of Modern Italian Studies 9:4:405-427 (2004) A group of Garibaldini, headed by the Greek poet Lorentzos Mavilis, fought also with the Greek side during the Balkan Wars. In early 1912, during the Italo-Turkish War, Italy occupied the predominantly Greek-inhabited Dodecanese Islands in the Aegean Sea from the Ottoman Empire. Although later with the 1919 Venizelos‚ÄìTittoni agreement, Italy promised to cede them to Greece, Carlo Sforza in 1920 renounced the accord. In 1913, after the end of the First Balkan War, lands of Northern Epirus were ceded to Greece, but Italy challenged the decision and in the Treaty of London the region was given to the newly created Albania. The local Greek population was enraged and created the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus, before it was reluctantly ceded to Albania, with peace assured by Italian peacekeeping force until 1919. Italy rejected the decision because it didn't want Greece to control both sides of the Straits of Corfu. In addition, although Sazan Island was ceded to Greece in 1864 as part of the Diapontia Islands, Greece ceded the island to the newly independent Albania in 1914 after the pressure of Italy, and since Greece didn't want to risk a war with Italy. Italy took possession of the island in 1920 and kept it through World War II. During the World War I, both Italy and Greece were members of the Allies and fought against the Central Powers but when the Italians found that Greece had been promised land in Anatolia at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, the Italian delegation withdrew from the conference for several months. Italy occupied parts of Anatolia which threatened the Greek occupation zone and the city of Smyrna. Greek troops were landed and the Greco-Turkish War (1919‚Äì22) began with Greek troops advanced into Anatolia. Turkish forces eventually defeated the Greeks and with Italian aid, recovered the lost territory, including Smyrna. When the Italian Fascists gained power in 1922, they persecuted the Greek-speakers in Italy.Minority Rights Group International - Italy - Greek-speakers In 1923, the new Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini used the murder of an Italian general on the Greco-Albanian border as a pretext to bombard and temporarily occupy Corfu, due to Corfu's strategic position at the entrance of the Adriatic Sea.\\"... because there is not the slightest doubt that the real cause of trouble is that old disturbing \\"Adriatic question \\" which has been the cause of many Balkan troubles, and is likely to be the cause of many more.\\" \\"But, though deprived of a base which would have made her control of the Adriatic more secure,...\\" Eleftherios Venizelos signs the Treaty of Friendship with Italy in Rome on 23 September 1928, while Benito Mussolini looks on The Greek general Theodoros Pangalos, who governed Greece as a dictator in 1925‚Äì26, sought to revise the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923 and launch a revanchist war against Turkey. To this end, Pangalos sought Italian diplomatic support, as Italy still had ambitions in Anatolia, but in the event, nothing came of his overtures to Mussolini. After the fall of Pangalos and the restoration of relative political stability in 1926, efforts were undertaken to normalize relations with Greece's neighbours. To this end, the Greek government, especially Foreign Minister Andreas Michalakopoulos, put renewed emphasis on improving relations with Italy, leading to the signature of a trade agreement in November 1926. The Italian‚ÄìGreek rapprochement had a positive impact on Greek relations with other Balkan countries, and after 1928 was continued by the new government of Eleftherios Venizelos, culminating in the treaty of friendship signed by Venizelos in Rome on 23 September 1928. Mussolini favoured this treaty, as it aided in his efforts to diplomatically isolate Yugoslavia from potential Balkan allies. An offer of alliance between the two countries was rebuffed by Venizelos but during the talks Mussolini personally offered \\"to guarantee Greek sovereignty\\" on Macedonia and assured Venizelos that in case of an external attack on Thessaloniki by Yugoslavia, Italy would join Greece. During the late 1920s and early 1930s, Mussolini sought diplomatically to create \\"an Italian-dominated Balkan bloc that would link Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, and Hungary\\". Venizelos countered the policy with diplomatic agreements among Greek neighbours and established an \\"annual Balkan conference ... to study questions of common interest, particularly of an economic nature, with the ultimate aim of establishing some kind of regional union\\". This increased diplomatic relations and by 1934 was resistant to \\"all forms of territorial revisionism\\". Venizelos adroitly maintained a principle of \\"open diplomacy\\" and was careful not to alienate traditional Greek patrons in Britain and France. The Greco-Italian friendship agreement ended Greek diplomatic isolation and the beginning of a series of bilateral agreements, most notably the Greco-Turkish Friendship Convention in 1930. This process culminated in the signature of the Balkan Pact between Greece, Yugoslavia, Turkey and Romania, which was a counter to Bulgarian revisionism. Italy, an Axis power, invaded Greece in the Greco-Italian War of 1940‚Äì41, but it was only with German intervention that the Axis succeeded in controlling Greece. Italian forces were part of the Axis occupation of Greece. Italy ceded the Dodecanese to Greece as part of the Treaty of Peace following World War II in 1947. As a consequence most of the Italians emigrated. After WWII and the end of the fascist regime, relations between the two countries were significally improved. Many Greeks, mostly leftists, found also refuge in Italy during the Greek military junta years. Today, there are still historical Greek communities in Italy and Italian communities in Greece.

The Greek Embassy in Oslo opened in 1980 and the Norwegian Embassy in Athens opened in 1974. In 1967, Norway and three other countries brought the Greek Case against the Greek junta regime for human rights violations. Greece's embassy in Oslo (since 1980) and an honorary consulate in Bergen represents Greece diplomatically in Norway. Norway has an embassy in Athens, and eight honorary consulates in Corfu, Crete (Chania and Iraklion), Kos, Patras, Piraeus, Rhodes and Thessaloniki. Both countries are members of NATO. Agreements The two countries have signed the Treaty on Social Security (1980), a Treaty on Cultural Agreement (1976), and an Agreement on the Avoidance of Double Taxation (1988).  Tourism  Greece, which ranks very high on the list of Norwegian tourist preferences, is amongst the top contenders, welcoming about 22% of the tourist population, which is estimated at some 250,000 people throughout the year. The tourist traffic flows from Norway to Greece in recent years have been increasing and Greece is a favorite destination for Norwegians. According to the Greek Statistical Service the number of Norwegians who visited Greece in 2002 came to 181,383 and in 2003 to 230,232. The island of Antiparos has often been described as the Norwegian island because here is more Norwegian tourists than any other tourists without Greeks.  Economic relations  Through the European Economic Area Agreement (EEA), Norway is a part of EU's Internal Market, and in addition has incorporated EU legislation to ensure that the \\"Four Freedoms\\" governing the EU/EEA Internal Market (i.e. free movement of goods, persons, capital, services), are being observed. As part of the EEA Agreement, Norway with the two other EFTA States have established the EEA Financial Mechanisms in order to contribute to the reduction of economic and social disparities within the European Economic Area Since 2001, Greek exports to Norway have increased in pharmaceuticals, cotton, clothing, non-ferrous metals, plastics, steel products, and fresh fruit and in 2003 amounted to some NOK 430 million (‚Ç¨52, 800, 000 approximately). Norway exports fishery products, maritime equipment, aluminium alloys, and granite, which in 2003 amounted to about NOK 970 million. Norwegian exports to Greece amount to approximately NOK 1,2 billion per year. Norway enjoys a large surplus of trade as the imports from Greece remain at just over NOK 400 million per year. Although trade between Greece and Norway has shown a slight decrease in the last three years, efforts are being made to boost trade and investment. The processes and projects associated with the implementation and strengthening of the EEA Mechanisms should bring more interaction between Greece and Norway, especially when it comes to the business sector. The sectors that are of particular interest to Norwegian exporters are Seafood, Environmental Technology and Alternative Energy as well as Shipping and Ship-Building. There has been a long shipping tradition between Greece and Norway and ships are sold and bought between the two countries frequently. Norwegian companies sell catamarans and other vessels as well as technological equipment to their Greek counterparts. Norwegian maritime exporters participate at POSEIDONIA Exhibition held in Greece and further development of relations with the Greek shipping industry in order to increase Norwegian shipping exports is desirable. The value of direct Norwegian investments in Greece came to NOK 1,006 million at the end of 2002 ‚Äì an important increase compared with previous years (2001: 605, 2000: 864, 1998: NOK 352 million).

The first vicar apostolic appointed for Congo was in 1518, and the intended territory was within modern northern Angola. Over a period of about eighty years, from 1880, the territory of the present Democratic Republic of Congo became divided into dioceses with their bishops, with apostolic vicariates being the intermediate stage. Early missions The evangelization of the Congo began as early as 1484, when Diogo Cam discovered the mouth of the Congo River, known as Zaire until the seventeenth century. Cam's naval chaplain set himself at once to preach to the natives, and won to Christianity the chief of the Sogno, a village on the right bank of the Congo, where he first landed. Some of the inhabitants of this village accompanied Cam on his return voyage and were solemnly baptized at the court of John II of Portugal. Later, the head chief of the Banza-Congo (Outeiro, the present San Salvador) asked King John for missionaries. Three were sent (whether they were Dominicans or Franciscans or members of a Lisbon chapter isn't known know); they finally baptized the head chief and many other subordinate ones at Banza-Congo, in a wooden structure called the Church of the Holy Cross. In 1518, a grandson of this chief, known as Henry, who had been ordained in Portugal, was made titular bishop of Utica, and appointed by Leo X Vicar Apostolic of Congo. He died before quitting Europe. From the beginning the Portuguese undertook to introduce Portuguese customs in Congo. At the beginning of the seventeenth century, a native chief, Alvarez II, sent one of his relatives, a marquis, as his representative to the papal court. The ambassador arrived in Rome in a dying condition, and expired the day after his arrival, the eve of the Epiphany, 1608. Pope Paul V, who personally assisted the ambassador in his last moments, gave him a magnificent state funeral, and erected to his memory a monument at St. Mary Major's. Later, Pope Urban VIII had a mausoleum erected to him by Bernini; it still stands at the entrance to the choir of the basilica. The Dominicans, Franciscans, Carmelites, and Jesuits were the first missionaries of the Congo. Their labours were trying, and rather fruitless. In the seventeenth century, the Jesuits had two colleges, one at Loanda, another, of minor importance, at San Salvador. On the whole, Christianity never took firm root, and was early brought into discredit by the slave-trading Portuguese. While the Portuguese always confined themselves to the Lower Congo, as early as the seventeenth century the missionaries had traversed the course of the Zaire, and a seventeenth-century map has been discovered which traces the river according to data supplied by them.http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04228a.htm Timeline *1640: The Prefecture Apostolic of Portuguese Congo is founded. *The mission of the Upper Congo was begun in 1880; it was erected into the Vicariate Apostolic of Upper Congo in 1895.http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/16082a.htm *Vicariate Apostolic of Belgian Congo *Vicariate Apostolic of French Congo *Vicariate Apostolic of Congo Free State *1886: The Vicariate Apostolic of Loango (or French Congo, or Lower Congo) was detached from the Vicariate Apostolic of Gaboon.http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09317a.htm *1886: Mission created, in 1888 the Apostolic Vicariate of L√©opoldville, from the Apostolic Prefecture of Lower Congo and the Apostolic Vicariate of Two Guineas. *1887: Apostolic Vicariate of Upper Congo was created from the Apostolic Vicariate of Tanganyika *The Vicariate Apostolic of Ubanghi (Upper French Congo) was created in 1890.http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15115b.htm *1892: The mission of Kwango is detached from the Vicariate Apostolic of Belgian Congo, and in 1903 becomes the Prefecture Apostolic of Kwango.http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08711b.htm *1901: The Prefecture Apostolic of Upper Kassai is created from the Vicariate Apostolic of Belgian Congo. *In 1909 the Prefecture Apostolic of Ubanghi-Chari was created from the Vicariate Apostolic of Ubanghi; it covered parts of what is now Chad.http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15115c.htm *The Katanga mission was separated from the Vicariate Apostolic of Belgian Congo in 1910.http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/16067c.htm The Matadi mission likewise was separated in 1911.

The ship attained an iconic status among the peoples of Yugoslavia in this role, as well as among the many diverse nations and members of the Non-Aligned Movement. \\"Galeb\\" is Croatian for \\"seagull\\". History Galeb was built in 1938 in Genoa as the auxiliary cruiser Ramb III, destined for service in the banana trade between Africa and Italy. After the armistice in 1943, it was taken over by the Germans and turned it into a minelayer under the name Kiebitz. While in Rijeka it was sunk on 25 November 1944 by Allied aircraft. Brodospas (SHIPSAVING) from Split, raised Kiebitz in 1948, after which it was taken to the Pula ship building company Uljanik where in 1952 it was reconstructed as a school ship of the Yugoslav Navy under the new name Galeb. Tito embarked on it the first time in 1952 in Podgora, where he conducted an inspection of the boats in the YWN from the deck of the ship. In the next 27 years Galeb was in Tito‚Äôs service for a total of 549 days, of which, for 318 days, the Marshal was on board, sailing over the Adriatic and other seas on political missions. By Tito‚Äôs death, 102 world statesmen had stayed on Galeb. Galeb is 117 metres long and 15 metres wide with a displacement of 5,754 tonnes. With the speed of it is powered by two Fiat diesel engines of 7,200 horsepower in total. The Italians, at one point, offered to SFRJ to remove them and exhibit them in the Fiat museum in Torino. In return, they offered to build an entirely new, modern, school ship, but the Yugoslavs declined. The ship first came to international attention in March 1953 when it brought Tito from Yugoslavia to the River Thames, following the invitation from the British Government headed by Prime Minister Winston Churchill. It was the first visit to United Kingdom of a communist head of state. Due to the yacht's size, Galeb moored at Greenwich. Proposals for the ship to dock at Malta en route to Britain were refused by the islands' Governor. Galeb in 2013 Tito loved the glamour the yacht conferred on his regime. He used it for parties, foreign visits and diplomacy. World leaders entertained there included Nikita Khrushchev, Muammar Gaddafi and Indira Gandhi. Tito was particularly excited to welcome Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, who played Tito in the 1973 war epic The Battle of Sutjeska. Galeb was used by Marshal Tito from 1948 till his death in 1980 when the yacht became the property of the Montenegrin government following the nation's breakup in 1991. It was sold to John Paul Papanicolaou, the same Greek yachtsman who owned the yacht Christina O. It was moored on the quayside of the Viktor Lenac Shipyard in Kostrena, a suburb of Rijeka for a time before being towed to its current location on the Rijeka waterfront. The Croatian authorities placed a preservation order on Galeb in the hope of acquiring the vessel to become a museum ship. In September 2008 the boat partially sank on its right side after a leak developed in its hull. On 22 May 2009, the ship was sold to city of Rijeka for US$150,000, subsequently confirmed by the High Mercantile Court of Croatia. Since then it has occasionally been opened to the public for art exhibitions, conferences and the like. On 16 July 2014, the Mayor of Rijeka announced that the Galeb would be leased out for mixed use, partly as a museum incorporating the former President's private rooms and some of the engineering space, and partly for commercial activities such as restaurants and bars. Tenders for private sector investment were invited, but produced no response. Funding of EUR 4.5 million has now been secured as part of Rijeka's successful bid to become European Capital of Culture in 2020. The work is expected to be done by 2021.

History London Central logo incorporating Go-Ahead branding The Go-Ahead Group is a large transport group based in Newcastle. It first became involved in London bus operations in September 1994, where upon the privatisation of London Buses it purchased London Central.

Further expansion did not occur until September 2006, when Docklands Buses was purchased. On 29 June 2007, the Go-Ahead purchased Blue Triangle. With these purchases, Go-Ahead surpassed Arriva London to become the largest operator of buses in London, running around 16% of London bus services. A corporate image for Go-Ahead's London bus services started to appear in August 2008, when a new Go-Ahead London logo was unveiled. In 2009, Transport for London invited bids for the sale of their own bus operations which ran under the East Thames Buses brand. Go-Ahead London were selected as the preferred bidder and assumed full responsibility for 10 routes and two depots in October that year. The East Thames brand was replaced with the Go-Ahead London brand. The East Thames operations were initially absorbed under the London General arm of Go-Ahead's London business. However, after some route movements and allocation changes some of the services now run under the London Central.

The rural historic landscape's period of significance includes the construction of the Andy Chambers, T.A. Moulton and John Moulton farms from 1908 to the 1950s. Six building clusters and a separate ruin illustrate Mormon settlement in the area and comprise such features as drainage systems, barns, fields and corrals. Apart from John and T.A. Moulton, other settlers in the area were Joseph Eggleston, Albert Gunther, Henry May, Thomas Murphy and George Riniker. The area is also known as Antelope Flats, situated between the towns of Moose and Kelly. It is a popular destination for tourists and photographers on account of the historic buildings, the herds of bison, and the spectacular Teton Range rising in the background. The alluvial soil to the east of Blacktail Butte was more suitable than most locations in Jackson Hole for farming, somewhat hampered by a lack of readily available water. The Mormon homesteaders began to arrive in the 1890s from Idaho, creating a community called \\"Gros Ventre\\", with a total of 27 homesteads. The Mormon settlers tended to create clustered communities, in contrast to the isolated homesteads more typical of Jackson Hole. The Mormon Row district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 5, 1997.

In 1999, Universal sold Brillstein's shares to Grey, and the company's television unit was subsequently rechristened Brad Grey Television as a result. Grey sold his interest in the company in 2005 due to his succeeding Sherry Lansing as Chief Executive Officer of Paramount Pictures, which created a conflict of interest.

Over the centuries, numerous dioceses were merged, in view of declining membership. Until 1944, the dioceses of Down and Dromore were part of the United Dioceses of Down, Connor and Dromore.

Messenger was born in London. He began cycling in the King's Cross area, and despite being a \\"mediocre\\" rider in his own words, he beat the hour for a 25-mile time trial at a time when this was rarely achieved. Tour of Britain Messenger was an official of the British League of Racing Cyclists, which started during the second world war to promote massed racing on public roads. The BLRC organised Tours of Britain under different names and sponsors and in 1958 secured sponsorship from the Milk Marketing Board. Messenger was the BLRC's event organiser and he and other officials visited the board at a hotel in central London. He said: :Our first meeting with the sponsor's PRO, Reg Pugh, was a near-fiasco, for the three of us, Eddie Lawton, Les Keith and myself, were working and groping in the dark, having to rely on figures conjured out of thin air by treasurer Ruben Smith. So poor, too, were we at this time that we arrived at the posh West End hotel with only enough money between the three of us to get back home. We came away elated, with more or less the 'Tour' in our pockets. We also came away with a budget well below what was needed for we had promised foreign teams (but no one said how we were going to get them.)Messenger, Chas (1998), Ride and Be Damned, Pedal Publishing, UK, p142 Messenger ran the Tour of Britain, known as the Milk Race, from 1958 to 1965. He was succeeded by Maurice Cumberworth. Messenger's Tour emphasised on long, hilly stages. Merger with the NCU Messenger and Peter Itter, chairman of the rival National Cycling Union, forged the links which merged the organisations to form the British Cycling Federation in 1959.

The site was homesteaded by Bill Menor in 1892-94, choosing a location where the river flowed in a single channel, rather than the braided stream that characterizes its course in most of Jackson Hole. During the 1890s it was the only homestead west of the river. Menor's homestead included a five-room cabin, a barn, a store, sheds and an icehouse on , irrigated by a ditch from Cottonwood Creek and at times supplemented by water raised from the Snake River by a waterwheel. Menor operated the ferry until 1918, selling to Maude Noble, who continued operations until 1927, when a bridge was built at Moose. Menor cabin and store The Menor house and store are unusual in their application of classical forms to rustic log construction, an effect heightened by the whitewashed walls of the buildings. Menor made his own whitewash using materials from a lime pit on his brother Holiday Menor's property on the other side of the river. The Menor cabin has three rooms, built individually over a period of time, with a bedroom on the west, a store on the east, and a kitchen and storage room connecting them. The Menor cabin was the point of departure for the first ascent of Grand Teton on August 11, 1898, and it hosted the celebratory party that evening. The Menor brothers were originally from Ohio. Holiday joined Bill in Jackson Hole in 1905, but the brothers did not speak for two years. Bill moved to California after selling to Noble. Holiday, eleven years younger, joined him about 1927. Noble Cabin The property also includes the log Maud Noble Cabin, built in 1916 to the northwest of the present site on Cottonwood Creek and relocated to the ferry site when Noble bought the Menor operation in 1918. Maud Noble was originally from Philadelphia; she arrived in Jackson Hole in 1915 on a visit to the Bar B C Dude Ranch and never left. The cabin is a one-story, three room structure that has been repeatedly renovated. The L-shaped building measures about by . Noble sold the property to the Snake River Land Company in 1929 after a bridge was built just downstream to replace the ferry. A tea room operated in the cabin about 1927 or 1928, and again in 1950-51. The cabin was the site of a meeting on July 23, 1923, where Yellowstone National Park superintendent and future National Park Service director Horace Albright met with local ranchers and businessmen, starting the process of creating Grand Teton National Park. Local attendees were Richard Winger, J. R. Jones, J. L. Enyon, and the Bar B C's Struthers Burt and Horace Carncross. Noble provided the discreet premises, but did not attend herself. Restoration The property was bought in 1929 by John D. Rockefeller, Jr., who restored the structures and the ferry and donated the property to the National Park Service in 1953. The property was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. The Park Service has restored the hand-operated ferry to operation from 2009. The ferry is a pontoon of two floats with a platform spanning between them, with sufficient room for a wagon and four-horse team. The ferry uses the force of the river to propel the pontoon along a cable stretched across the river. The Park Service has also restored Menor's well. The ferry district was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 16, 1969.

It is roughly bounded by Grand River, Woodward and Michigan Avenues, and Washington Boulevard. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. Description Capitol Park itself is a triangular plot of land (now a public park) bounded by Shelby Street, Griswold Street, and State Street. The plot is an artifact of Augustus Woodward's 1805 plan for the city of Detroit. The Historic District includes the park and seventeen surrounding buildings for a block in each direction. Buildings within the district include the Farwell Building, the Griswold Building, the David Stott Building, the Detroit Savings Bank Building and the Industrial Building. History The first capitol building in Detroit, c. 1847 In 1823, the population of Detroit had increased to the point that the US Congress transferred governance of what was then the Territory of Michigan to the governor and legislative council. To house the new government, a courthouse was built in Capitol Park in 1823-28. When Michigan became a state in 1837, the building became the state capitol, and functioned so until 1847 when the governmental seat was moved to Lansing. The building was then used as a public high school until 1893, when it was destroyed by fire. The land was then converted to a park, and it has remained a public space up to the present. The buildings within the Historic District surrounding the park were built primarily during the first three decades of the 20th century for commercial and business purposes. Several famous architects, including Albert Kahn and Gordon W. Lloyd, contributed buildings in a range of styles, from Victorian to Beaux-Arts to Art Deco. The buildings demonstrate the transformation of Detroit from a prospering 19th century commercial center to a modern city. In addition to the present buildings, Capitol Park has a historic connection to the Underground Railroad. In 1850, Seymour Finney purchased a plot of land near the park and erected a tavern with a large barn. Finney was strongly sympathetic to the abolitionist cause, and used his barn to hide escaping slaves before their final trek across the river into Canada. A State of Michigan historical marker has been erected in the park to commemorate Finney's Barn. In 1905, the remains of Michigan's first governor Stevens T. Mason were transferred from New York City where he died 1843 and interred in Capitol Park in a ceremony attended by sitting governor Fred M. Warner and mayor George P. Codd among other officials. A statue of Mason by sculptor Albert Weinert was later erected over the grave. When plans were announced in 2009 to reconfigure the park, they included relocating the monument and grave. However, the burial vault was not where earlier plans indicated and crews searched for four days before it was located on June 29, 2010. It was believed the grave was moved from its 1905 location in 1955 to make room for a bus terminal. On the 199th anniversary of his birth, October 27, 2010, Mason was reburied for 4th time in a newly built vault in the pedestal the bronze statue. The current Dean of the Cathedral Church of St. Paul, where funeral services were held for Mason in 1843, officiated at the ceremony. Transit hub & redevelopment The park has also served as a major downtown transit center. Two years after the destruction of the state capitol by fire, multiple streetcar lines were looped around the new park with large boarding platforms constructed on Griswold and Shelby streets, transforming it into a major transfer station. In 1955, the Department of Street Railways (DSR) constructed the $280,000 Capitol Park Bus Terminal at the north end of the park which facilitated the moving of Stevens T. Mason's tomb to the south end of the park. The new facility was constructed using steel and reinforced concrete, with plastic skylights throughout the concrete canopy. Not long after the restructuring of the DSR as the Detroit Department of Transportation (DDOT), the station was demolished in 1979, though the area around the park continued to be used as a major bus terminal. In 2001, the area was named as the Capitol Park Transit Center, and was used as a temporary terminal until the completion of the Rosa Parks Transit Center. The opening of the Rosa Parks Transit Center in downtown Detroit in July 2009 marked the end of Capitol Park's use as a transportation center. A $1.1 million renovation project started in September 2009 by the city's Downtown Development Authority redeveloped the public space in an effort to draw new businesses to the area.Development Promises New Life for Historic Capitol Park, Model D Media Gallery The Detroit Institute of Music Education (DIME) and Urban Bean at Grand River and Griswold St in Capitol Park Image:Capitol Park 1942.jpgCapitol Park in 1942, looking north Image:FarwellBuildingDetroit.jpgFarwell Building, looking through Capitol Park Image:CapitolParkDetroit.jpgLooking south on Griswold at State, with The David Stott Building on the left Image:GriswoldBuildingDetroit.jpgGriswold Building Image:Capitol Park 2011.JPGCapitol Park in 2011 Image:Stevens T Mason Monument.JPGStevens T.

The city used four-wheeled double-decked trams painted dark red (madder) and white ‚Äì a livery still used by Lothian Buses and the post-2014 Edinburgh Trams. Origins Remnant of the old cable-hauled tramway remain on Waterloo Place at the East End of Princes Street The first trams in Edinburgh were horse-drawn and operated by the Edinburgh Street Tramways Company. This replaced an earlier horse-drawn coach system. The inaugural service (Haymarket to Bernard Street) ran on 6 November 1871. The tracks were laid by Sir James Gowans with John Macrae as engineer. These lines complemented and partly replaced the pre-existing horse-drawn carriage from Edinburgh to Leith, the only essential difference being the addition of guide rails. In January 1888 the Edinburgh Northern Tramways started the first cable-hauled trams. This had its depot and drive-mechanism on Henderson Row, a building partially preserved in the Royal London (formerly Scottish Life Assurance) offices there. Part of the winding gear is preserved on the pavement to the east side of the office. In 1894 the Edinburgh Street Tramway lines in Edinburgh (but not Leith or Portobello) were taken over by the Edinburgh and District Tramways Company. On 1 July 1919 Edinburgh Corporation took over the operation of the city's tramways. The system remained under the overall control of R. S. Pilcher, who had joined the company in 1918 having previously run Aberdeen's tramways. Leith Corporation took over the still horse-drawn Leith tramlines in 1904 and introduced electric traction in 1905 (the first electric system in Scotland). Edinburgh Corporation took over the Leith system in 1920 (see below). Electrification Stockbridge (now an insurance company office) Until 1920 Leith was a separate burgh, with its own municipal tram system. The Leith system was electrified, whereas the Edinburgh system used cable haulage (as still used by the San Francisco cable car system and the Great Orme Tramway in Wales). The cable was housed in a shallow trough between the tram rails; breakages could reduce the entire system to a standstill. The main depot was moved to Shrubhill on Leith Walk. An underground chamber at the main turn into the garages here was permanently manned during operating hours to try to reduce cable-snagging. Passengers going from Edinburgh to Leith had to change trams (from cable-drawn to electric) at Pilrig on Leith Walk at the boundary between Leith and Edinburgh. This confused exchange of passengers was known locally as \\"the Pilrig muddle\\", and lasted until the electrification of the Edinburgh system. In 1922 Edinburgh Corporation decided to convert the entire system to electric traction. This took around three years to implement. The last cable tram operated in June 1923. A short section of original tram rail and cable track can still be seen in Waterloo Place. Musselburgh also had its own electrified tram system from 1906. Passengers had to change to the cable- hauled Edinburgh trams at Joppa until 1923. The Musselburgh system was subsequently incorporated into the Edinburgh system, with the tramway to Port Seton closing east of Levenhall in 1928. Musselburgh continued to be served by Edinburgh trams until 1954. Extensions The system continued to expand during the 1930s. New routes included Gorgie to Stenhouse (1930), Braids to Fairmilehead (1936) and North Gyle to Maybury (1937). Further extensions were curtailed due to the outbreak of World War II. Closure An Edinburgh Standard tram in 1947 The Shrubhill Depot, Leith Walk Edinburgh Corporation introduced its first motor bus in 1914. In 1928, given the increasing importance of buses, the Edinburgh Corporation Tramways Department was renamed the Edinburgh Corporation Transport Department. Following World War II, all municipal tramways in the United Kingdom (with the sole exception of the Blackpool tramway) were progressively closed and replaced by diesel buses. Initially, Edinburgh Corporation took advantage of the closure of other systems by buying modern secondhand trams from Manchester Corporation. Nevertheless, a programme of replacement of trams by buses was introduced in the early 1950s. Edinburgh's last tram operated on 16 November 1956, terminating at the Shrubhill Depot on Leith Walk (archive film footage exists of the event). One tramcar has been preserved ‚Äì number 35, built in 1948 ‚Äì which was put on display in a small museum at the Shrubhill Depot for a number of years. The museum eventually closed in the 1980s due to a leaking roof. Tram number 35 operated briefly at the Glasgow Garden Festival in 1988 and on the Blackpool tramway, before going into retirement at the National Tramway Museum in Derbyshire where it remains on display today. Various reasons were given for replacing the trams including the problem of a fixed-rail system with largely street-running which meant that a single accident could bring much of the system to a halt. In reality, the policy was largely due to a change of local political power in the city in 1950 and to the appointment of William Morrison Little as General Manager in 1950. William Morrison Little thought that buses would serve the city better than trams. The increased popularity of the motor car in post-war Britain created an environment in which trams were seen generally as archaic and as an obstruction to other traffic. When buses replaced trams they followed the same routes previously taken by the trams and used the same route numbers. This led to some anomalies which still , such as the absence of buses on the Pleasance‚Äîa major city artery‚Äîwhich was too steep at its northern end for trams. Lothian Buses only started to serve the Pleasance in 2014 (route 60). Tram managers The first Edinburgh Corporation Tram Manager was R Stuart Pilcher who was appointed at the early age of 24 in 1919 having previously worked in Aberdeen. He left his post in 1929 to become Tram Manager in Manchester, England. He subsequently became Chairman of the Traffic Commissioners in the West Midlands of England. In 1921 he was responsible for establishing a trade organisation which eventually became part of the Scottish Council of the Confederation of Passenger Transport (CPT). Pilcher managed the electrification of Edinburgh's trams in 1922/3. At the luncheon held on 15 January 1929 to mark his departure from Edinburgh and in response to Lord Provost Sir Alexander Stevenson's remarks, he said that \\"they deliberately planned the changeover so as not to affect public opinion. They were nervous of the effect of the hoardings and a half-finished job.\\" He was followed by FA Fitzpayne MIEE, who remained in post until 1934 when Robert McLeod M Inst T took over. He in turn was succeeded by William Morrison Little in 1949. Tramcars Inherited fleet Edinburgh Corporation inherited 38 electric trams from the Leith system, and almost 200 Edinburgh cable car bodies were converted to electric propulsion in the period 1921-24. There was initially some experimentation with bogie trucks (including attempts to electrify the original cable car chassis) but it was quickly decided to standardise on new 4-wheel trucks. Most of these early cars had originally been open top, but most were modernised with top covers and the later survivors also received vestibule screens and enclosed balconies. The last open top car was scrapped in 1934 and the final ex-Leith cars were withdrawn in 1936, but some of the converted cable cars remained in service until 1947. The body of car 226 (a former cable car dating from 1903 and withdrawn in 1938) was secured for preservation in 1987 after being used as a holiday chalet, and is undergoing restoration. The Musselburgh company's trams were not included in the acquisition of that system. Standard cars Between 1922 and 1934, 240 Edinburgh Standard cars were built by the Corporation's Shrubhill Works and four private builders (McHardy & Elliot, Leeds Forge, English Electric and Pickering). Like all subsequent Edinburgh trams these were 4-wheelers. All featured timber 4-bay bodies, initially with open balconies on the upper decks, but cars built from 1930 had enclosed balconies and these were subsequently added to the earlier Standard cars as well. They were withdrawn between 1949 and 1956. Experimental cars Two cars were built at Shrubhill in 1932 and 1933 as a prelude to the development of a new generation of trams. Car 180 featured composite construction (steel frames but wood and aluminium panelling, unlike the predominantly timber Standard cars) and had a 5-bay body with flat sides and curved corner glazing which gave it a much more modern appearance than the Standard cars. It was delivered in a special red and grey livery which earned it the nickname \\"Red Biddy\\". Car 261 was a less radical development, being essentially a Standard car with flat lower deck sides. It was withdrawn in 1955, but car 180 survived until the final closure of the Edinburgh tram system on 16 November 1956. All-steel cars Preserved Edinburgh car 35 at Crich The next new trams were various all-steel cars purchased from private builders. There were three broad types: * 2 cars from Metro-Cammell in 1933 (nos. 260 and 265), resembling the Red Biddy but without the curved glazing * 9 cars from Metro- Cammell and Hurst Nelson in 1934, similar but with domed roofs (the first Edinburgh cars with this feature) * 23 cars from English Electric, Metro- Cammell and Hurst Nelson in 1934-35, with raked-back \\"streamlined\\" ends and domed roofs Five of the 1934 Metro-Cammell batch were withdrawn relatively early in 1951-52, but all the others ran until 1955-56. New Standard composite cars The last new trams built for Edinburgh Corporation were 84 cars built at Shrubhill between 1935 and 1950. These were of five-bay composite construction, being a development of the Red Biddy but with flat corner glass, domed roofs and various other refinements. The whole class survived until 1956, with 35 of them in service until the final closure of the system. Of these, car 35 (built in 1948) was selected by the City for preservation. It is now at the National Tramway Museum in Crich, Derbyshire. Ex-Manchester \\"Pilcher\\" cars 11 former Manchester Corporation cars were purchased in 1947‚Äì49. These were longer than the indigenous cars and were therefore confined to the relatively straight route from Waterloo Place to Levenhall. Although relatively modern cars dating from 1930 to 1932, they were in very poor condition when they arrived in Edinburgh and required extensive refurbishment before entering service. All were withdrawn in 1954. New line A new tram line from Edinburgh Airport to York Place (in the city centre) opened on Saturday 31 May 2014.

He is considered a suspect in the infamous St. Valentine's Day Massacre of 1929. Born and raised in St. Louis, Carey joined the Egan's Rats gang in his early twenties. By 1917, he had made fast friends with Fred \\"Killer\\" Burke, who would turn out to be one of his closest criminal associates. After U.S. Army service during World War I, Carey remained a low-level associate of the Egan Gang. At this time, Burke was away in prison and Bob Carey became associated with Cincinnati hoodlum, Raymond \\"Crane Neck\\" Nugent. Both men were suspected of robbing of a Cincinnati bank messenger in December 1921 and trying to fence the bonds through the Egan's Rats. Carey was an alcoholic who got quite sloppy and violent when he drank. Nevertheless, it was Carey who was suspected of convincing Fred Burke to don a fake police uniform to rob a St. Louis distillery of $80,000 worth of whiskey on April 25, 1923. With the imprisonment of the upper-echelon of the Egan gang in 1924, Burke's crew had relocated to Detroit, where they were arrested for the March 1924 robbery of the John Kay jewelry store. While Carey was suspected of taking part, only Isidore Londe was convicted, receiving a 10-20 year sentence. Carey was suspected of participating in most of the major actions of Fred Burke's crew in the 1920s. Bob was specifically charged by Detroit Police with murdering two freelance hoods, James Ellis and Leroy Snyder, on March 16, 1927 after he caught them cheating at poker. Along with Gus Winkler, Fred Goetz, Ray Nugent, and Charlie Fitzgerald, Carey took part in the American Express armored car robbery on April 16, 1928 in Toledo, Ohio. The gangsters made off with $200,000 and killed Toledo police officer George Zientara. While never publicly named as a suspect, the Chicago Police Department sought Carey for participating in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre of 1929. FBI informant Byron Bolton would later claim that Carey did indeed take part, along with Fred Burke, Gus Winkler, Fred Goetz, and others. With most of his closest associates locked up or dead by early 1932, Carey left Chicago for the East Coast. He and his girlfriend ended up in Baltimore, where they began blackmailing well-to-do businessmen and politicians. The marks would bed Rose Sanborn and Carey would discreetly take pictures. By summer, they had moved into a Manhattan apartment at 220 W. 104th Street. Carey, now using the alias of Sanborn, had begun a high-quality counterfeiting operation out of his place. Despite his newfound success, Carey was still isolated, wanted across the country, and drinking heavily. The NYPD concluded that around midnight on July 30, 1932, Carey went berserk and shot his girlfriend Rose to death, after which he turned the gun on himself. In addition to being wanted for the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, Carey was a suspect in the Lindbergh kidnapping. Before leaving Chicago in January 1932, he had hinted darkly to associates that he was planning a crime that \\"would set the world on its ears\\". The FBI also investigated Carey in connection with the crime until the arrest of Bruno Hauptmann. Further reading *Waugh, Daniel.

He teaches a year 11 science class about evolution, which many of the students are reluctant to accept. He then takes them to the Jurassic Coast in Dorset to search for fossils, hoping that the students can see some of the evidence for themselves.Series overview - Episode 1 channel4.com Dawkins also visits the place of his birth, Nairobi, where he interviews a prostitute who seems to have a genetic immunity to HIV, and talks to microbiologist Larry Gelmon. He goes on to predict that genetic immunity is a trait that will become more prevalent in the community over time. Part 2: The Fifth Ape In the second episode Richard Dawkins deals with some of the philosophical and social ramifications of the theory of evolution.Series overview - Episode 2 channel4.com Dawkins starts out in Kenya, speaking with palaeontologist Richard Leakey. He then visits Christ is the Answer Ministries, Kenya's largest Pentecostal church, to interview Bishop Bonifes Adoyo.

Dawkins discusses social Darwinism and eugenics, explaining how these are not versions of natural selection, and that \\"Darwin has been wrongly tainted\\". He then meets with evolutionary psychologist Steven Pinker to discuss how morals can be compatible with natural selection. He goes on to explaining sexual selection, with peafowls as an example. To find out whether sexual selection plays a role for altruism and kindness among humans, he visits women who are looking for sperm donors, as well as a sperm bank manager. Dawkins also explains kin selection and selfish genes. Part 3: God Strikes Back In the third and final episode, Dawkins explains why Darwin's theory is one of history's most controversial ideas.Series overview - Episode 3 channel4.com Dawkins uses this episode to discuss the opposition that evolution has experienced since it was first discovered. He starts by approaching various anti-evolutionists, ranging from John Mackay from Creation Research, Wendy Wright, President of Concerned Women for America, to English school teacher Nick Cowen. In order to address concerns they bring up, he shows the evidence for evolution, including fossil and DNA evidence. He also talks to the teachers of the science students who he taught during the first episode, asking them why they aren't adequately teaching the ideas of science properly, allowing instead their students to believe that truth is personal and that science is merely a point of view. Dawkins also describes Darwin's personal loss of faith, based not only on the natural mechanisms he saw, but also on the cruelty in the world which seemed to deny a loving God, in particular the loss of his daughter Annie. While Dawkins does address the bleakness of the Darwinian view, he spends the last part of this episode describing how Darwin and he himself address it, ending by saying: References External links Channel 4 documentaries British television documentaries Documentary films about nature Works by Richard Dawkins 2008 British television series debuts 2008 British television series endings Charles Darwin bicentenary Scientific skepticism mass media ","title":"The Genius of Charles Darwin"},{"id":"18843093","text":"The Honda CBR1000F Hurricane is a sport touring motorcycle, part of the CBR series manufactured by Honda from 1987 to 1996 in the United States and from 1987 to 1999 in the rest of the world. It is powered by a liquid-cooled, DOHC, , 16-valve inline-four engine. The CBR1000F, along with the CBR750F and CBR600F, was Honda's first inline four-cylinder, fully-faired sport bike.  History  Manufactured from 1987 to 1996 in the U.S. to late 1999 in the rest of the world, the Hurricane went through only three major revisions. In 1989, the bike received a cosmetic makeover with a complete redesign of the front fairing, improvements to the bike's front suspension, larger tires were added to help cope with the bike's heavy weight and to accommodate radial tires, improvements were also added to the bike's cam chain tensioner in an attempt to remove the annoying cam chain rattle some riders had reported. The 1989 model also had its power slightly increased, and it gained weight. In 1992, the bike's looks were overhauled with a more streamlined and modern looking bodywork added. The biggest change was the introduction of DCBS, Honda's dual combined braking system. Honda‚Äôs first street motorcycle with a combined braking system (then called Unified Braking) was the 1983 Gold Wing GL1100. This system was derived from a 1970s RCB1000 world endurance race bike. The DCBS system was introduced to assist rider braking where the front brake lever operates two of the three pistons on the front calipers but also proportionally applies pressure to one piston of the rear brake caliper, while using the rear brake will engage one piston in front calipers and two pistons on the rear. Since then DCBS has evolved into a very popular addition to many Honda touring motorcycles. No major changes were made after 1992. A touring model was briefly launched that offered a larger screen and hard panniers. The CBR was weighed by Cycle World at tank empty and wet for California model. Honda claims a dry weight of , and wet. The seat is high and the wheelbase is . The engine is housed in a steel box section perimeter frame, air-assisted 41 mm telescopic front forks and an adjustable monoshock at the rear. The front brakes are twin 296 mm discs using three piston Nissin calipers on later models (two piston calipers 1987-88), the rear is a single 256 mm disc, and DCBS are used on all models after 1992.  Engine  The CBR's engine went largely unchanged throughout its history. It uses the standard Honda inline four-cylinder 998 cc, four-stroke, DOHC, 16-valve, liquid-cooled power plant running four 38 mm CV carburetors and has a bore and stroke of . It produces at 8600 rpm and (rear wheel) of torque at 6500 rpm. It had a acceleration of 11.19 seconds at . The fuel tank holds .  Discontinuation  From 1992, Honda introduced the Supersport series with the Tadao Baba developed Fireblade, which took sales from the heavier CBR1000F. The model was hence discontinued in the USA from 1996 as the CBR1100XX was released, but continued to sell in Asian and European markets until Honda finally ended its run in late 1999.

It links the Col de Saint-Ignace, some to the east of Saint-Jean-de-Luz, to the summit of the La Rhune mountain (Larrun). Although this summit lies on the border between France and Spain, the railway lies entirely within the French d√©partement of Pyr√©n√©es-Atlantiques.  History  Train at summit station, showing the twin wires of the three-phase supply. The Atlantic coast can be seen in the background. The idea of building a railway to the summit of La Rhune was first proposed in 1908, and a law passed in 1912 entrusted the construction and operation to the d√©partement. Work started on the construction of the line in 1912, but was suspended during World War I. The line opened on 30 June 1924. In a referendum in 1978, the population of the nearby village of Sare rejected a proposal to build a road to the summit of the Rhune, thus enabling the railway to survive. The concession to build the line, and operate it until 1982, was granted by the d√©partement to the Soci√©t√© Anonyme des Chemins de Fer Basques, which changed its name to the Voies Ferr√©es D√©partementales du Midi in 1914. The original concession was extended until 1994 and, as a result of a merger, it was taken over by the Soci√©t√© Hydro√©lectrique du Midi in 1989. In 1994, the concession expired and operation of the line reverted to the d√©partement. From 1995 until 2012 the line was operated under contract by CFTA, a subsidiary of Veolia Transport, a large international transport services business that also operates several other tourist railways in France. In 2012 √âtablissement public des stations d‚Äôaltitude (EPSA) stepped in as operator.  Technical details  A train on the mountain. The line has the following technical characteristics: * Length: * Rack system: Strub * Altitude of bottom station: * Altitude of upper station: * Maximum gradient: 250 ‚Ä∞ * Time of journey: 30 minutes * Speed: * Electricity supply: 3000 V, 50 Hz, three-phase Trains consist of a four-wheeled electric locomotive that pushes two coaches up the mountain, and leads them down. Each coach is carried by a four-wheeled bogie at its upper end, and a single two-wheeled axle at its lower end. With six ten-seat compartments in each coach, each train carries 120 passengers. The line operates from mid-March until early-November, with trains every 35 minutes. The line is one of four lines in the world still using three-phase electric power.

To the west it reaches the easternmost parts of Afghanistan. The range of the Astor markhor is very scattered. At one time considered an \\"endangered species\\", conservation efforts have had some success and the largest subpopulation in Pakistan may now exceed 1000 individuals. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its status as \\"near-threatened\\". Ecology The Astor markhor lives in the scrubland and open woodland that clothe the rugged slopes of the mountains among which it lives at altitudes of up to . It seldom goes above the tree line; in summer it feeds largely on grasses and leaves but in winter it mainly browses on shrubs and woody material. One or two kids are born after a gestation period of 135 to 170 days. The goats are hunted by snow leopards, wolves and lynx, and the kids may fall prey to golden eagles. Status At one time C. f. falconeri was assessed as being endangered but it is now rated as \\"near-threatened\\" as there are now estimated to be more individuals than was thought at one time. The 2011 estimate for the total population is around 5,800 individuals. These are divided into a number of sub-populations, only one of which numbers over 1000 individuals. The main threat it faces is being hunted. Even where the animal is protected by legislation as in Afghanistan, poaching takes place and the ban on hunting is not enforced. In India it is fully protected and is present in three wildlife reserves, the Limber Game Reserve, and the Lachipora Wildlife Sanctuary and the Hirapora Wildlife Sanctuary. These three areas are planned to be combined to create the Kazinag National Park in order to protect the Astor markhor and other mammals such as the snow leopard and the Himalayan brown bear.

One day, Maxwell climbed a tree while watching a baseball game, in an attempt to catch a fly ball; someone yelled, \\"Hey, look at Jocko!\\" Jocko The Monkey was the name of a popular performer in 1920s era films and the name stuck. He later served in the United States Army in Europe during World War II. He served with the Army Special Service Department, a unit that entertained the troops, serving until 1945.\\"Jocko Maxwell Now Out; Broadcasts.\\" (New York City) Amsterdam News, December 29, 1945, p. 10.

Sports broadcasting career  Maxwell reportedly began his broadcasting career in 1929 at the age of 22 when he began doing a five-minute weekly sports report on WNJR, a radio station based in Newark. (There are some discrepancies as to which station Maxwell first began working at, but most sources point to WNJR). WNJR was known as the \\"voice of Newark\\" during the 1920s and was owned by Herman Lubinsky, the co- founder of Savoy Records. However, at the time Jocko went to work there in 1929, the station was known as WNJ; when that station went defunct, it returned to the air later as WNJR.\\"Jocko Maxwell Made Sports Director of WWRL.\\" Chicago Defender, April 11, 1942, p. 20. It is believed by many authors and historians of the radio era that Maxwell became the first African American sports reporter. In fact, the black press of the 1930s and early 1940s regularly asserted that Maxwell was the first and only black sportscaster on radio,\\"Jocko Maxwell in Big Sportscasting Rise.\\" Atlanta Daily World, March 30, 1942, p. 5. although some newspapers qualified it by saying he was the only black sports announcer in the East, or in any major city.Romeo L. Dougherty. \\"Sport Commentator Over Air.\\" (New York City) Amsterdam News, July 9, 1934, p. 10. Maxwell was broadcasting on stations throughout northern New Jersey, and was also heard in New York City, beginning in the early 1930s. He was a sports commentator at station WHOM in Jersey City, where he hosted a program called Sport Hi Lites, and also reported about area teams.\\"Sport Commentator Featured on WHOM.\\" (New York City) Amsterdam News, April 21, 1934, p. 10. He later hosted a sports report called, \\"Runs, Hits and Errors\\" on WRNY, a station based in Coytesville, New Jersey, which had a studio in Manhattan at the Roosevelt Hotel. His reports gradually expanded to include interviews with Negro league baseball players. In 1938, he joined station WWRL, where his \\"Five Star Sports Final\\" program became very popular; on it, he interviewed some of the biggest stars in pro sports, including Hank Greenberg, Sid Luckman, and Dixie Walker. By 1942, he had been promoted to the station's sports director.\\"Jocko Maxwell Made Sports Director of Station WWRL.\\" Chicago Defender, April 11, 1942, p. 20. Maxwell later became the public address sports announcer at Ruppert Stadium for the Negro leagues team the Newark Eagles. He initially announced for games only on Sundays. Maxwell continued broadcasting for both games and radio stations until 1967. Maxwell also founded and managed the Newark Starlings, a mixed race, semi-professional baseball team. He also became a contributing writer to Baseball Digest, where he wrote about subjects ranging from the integration of baseball to Jackie Robinson. In 1940, Maxwell authored a book of interviews with players entitled, Thrills and Spills in Sports. He also submitted stories on the Newark Eagles to the Ledger in Newark, which is the predecessor of The Star- Ledger newspaper. In the 1950s and 1960s, he wrote historical articles about the Negro Leagues; his work was syndicated in a number of black newspapers, thus keeping the players' names alive for a new generation.Jocko Maxwell. \\"Old-Time Negro Baseball Players-- A Major League Loss.\\" Norfolk (VA) New Journal and Guide, September 10, 1966, p. 22. He was inducted into the Newark Athletic Hall of Fame in 1994. In 2001, Maxwell achieved his lifelong dream by visiting the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, when he was 93 years old, though he was not inducted into the Hall of Fame during his lifetime. Death Sherman Maxwell died on July 16, 2008, of complications of pneumonia at Chester County Hospital in West Chester, Pennsylvania. He was 100 years old. He was survived by his sister, Berenice Maxwell Cross, of West Caldwell, New Jersey, and his son, Bruce Maxwell, of West Chester, Pennsylvania. His wife, Mamie, and daughter, Lisa, had died previously. In an interview after Maxwell's death, Bob Kendrick, the director of marketing for the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Missouri said that Maxwell had been well known by Negro league players as someone who preserved records and scores that would have been lost without him.

According to one estimate, Romanian citizens of Bulgarian origin number around 250,000.–ü–∞–≤–ª–æ–≤. Historically, Bulgarian communities in modern Romania have existed in Wallachia (, transliterated: Vlashko), Northern Dobruja (, translit. Severna Dobrudzha) and Transylvania (, translit. Sedmigradsko). Currently, however, the Bulgarian community in present-day Romania that has retained most efficiently its numbers, social integrity and strong ethnic identity is that of the Banat Bulgarians, a Roman Catholic minority in the Banat who account for the bulk of the Bulgarian-identifying population of Romania. In Wallachia, they are only few Bulgarians who preserved their national identity, though the numbers of those who speak Bulgarian and affirm to have Bulgarian ancestors is still high. Much of the Torlak-speaking Roman Catholic Krashovani who today form a part of the Croatian minority in Romania had declared themselves Bulgarian during Austria-Hungary.Die √∂sterreichisch- ungarische Monarchie in Wort und Bild, Vienna 1902:File:Austria-Hungary (ethnic).JPG The population of undisputed Bulgarian origin aside, Bulgarian researchers also claim that the Hungarian minority of the Sz√©kely in central Romania is of Magyarized Bulgar (Proto-Bulgarian) origin and the »òchei of Transylvania were Romanianized Bulgarians (a view also supported by Lyubomir Miletich and accepted by Romanian writers). Names While the modern Romanian word for Bulgarians is \\"bulgari\\", throughout the history they have been known by other names. The old Bulgarian population‚Äîwhich existed in Romania by the time of the founding of the principality of Wallachia and the inclusion of Transylvania in the Hungarian Kingdom‚Äîwas referred as »òchei. This word, currently obsolete, derives from the Latin word sclavis, referring to all South Slavs. Currently, the word appears in many place names in Wallachia and Transylvania, among which, »òcheii Bra»ôovului, a neighborhood of Bra≈üov. The Bulgarians who migrated during the 19th century were known as s√¢rbi (Serbians). This word may have been used by Romanians to refer to all South Slavs,–ù—è–≥—É–ª–æ–≤, p. 56, note 47. but it has also been proposed that they used this ethnic identification to prevent the Ottomans from demanding the Wallachian authorities to return the refugees to their place of origin.Anton Manea Bre≈ütea, 150 de ani, monografie, Ed. Helicon, Timi»ôoara, 1997; reprinted in G√¢ndul literar, Aprilie 2007 Even today, the Bulgarians from Wallachia are called \\"s√¢rbi\\" (=Serbians) though they speak Bulgarian and define themselves as \\"bulgari\\" (=Bulgarians). History Antiquity and medieval Bulgarian Empire In Antiquity, both Bulgaria and Romania were inhabited by Thracian tribes, contributing to the ethnogenesis of the Romanian people and possibly the Bulgarian people (along with Slavs and Bulgars), although this is a matter of dispute. During the Migration Period, both the Slavs and the Bulgars crossed what is today Romania to settle in the plains south of the Danube, establishing the First Bulgarian Empire in the 7th century. In the Middle Ages, the lands between the Danube and the Carpathians were scarcely settled, but they were often at least nominally under Bulgarian control in the 9th and 10th century, as well as during some periods of the Second Bulgarian Empire. The Golden Age of Bulgarian culture under Simeon I exerted considerable influence on the empire's transdanubian possessions. Old Bulgarian was established as the language of liturgy and written communication along with the Cyrillic script created in Bulgaria, which was used for the Romanian language until the 1860s; the first written text in the Romanian language, Neac≈üu's letter of 1512, illustrates this trend: it was written in Cyrillic, intermixed with Bulgarian sentences and phrases. To this day, a notable part of Romanian's core vocabulary is of Latinized South Slavic origin, although much of it was replaced by Romance and Classical Latin loanwords in the 19th century. Under the Ottomans As the Second Bulgarian Empire fell under full-scale Ottoman rule in the 14th-15th century whereas the lands north of the Danube were still contested between the Europeans and the Ottomans and then came under Ottoman suzerainty, but retained their internal autonomy, many Bulgarian fled the Ottoman occupation in various periods and settled in what is today Romania. These included both Bulgarian Orthodox and some Roman Catholics (either former Paulicians from the central Bulgarian north or from Chiprovtsi in the northwest). The migratory waves were particularly strong after the Austro-Turkish and Russo-Turkish Wars of the 17th-19th century. The Orthodox Bulgarians settled all around the Principality of Wallachia; however, many of them gradually lost their Bulgarian identity and became Romanianized. Catholics primarily migrated to the Austrian-ruled Banat and Transylvania, establishing still-extant communities in modern Timi»ô County and Arad County; some former Paulicians also settled around Bucharest, in Cioplea and Pope≈üti- Leordeni. The Transylvanian city of Bra≈üov (Kronstadt) grew into an international merchant centre attracting Bulgarian merchants ever since the 14th century (it was given trade rights in Bulgaria by Bulgarian tsar Ivan Sratsimir's Bra≈üov Charter of 1369‚Äì1380) and rivalled Constantinople and Thessaloniki in importance, particularly for the people from northern Bulgaria, with many Bulgarian merchants opening offices and shops in the city. As early as 1392, Bulgarian settlers arrived in the city, contributing to the construction of the city church, today known as the Black Church, Original text in German: \\"Den ersten Anfang des Anbanes dieser Vorstadt setzen alle Nachrichten, die ich finde, in die Zeit des 14 Seculi, in welchem die hiesige Stadkirche 1385 gebauet za werden anfing. Da es n√§mlich bei diesem wichtigen Bau an genugsamen Handleuthen aus iler Ursache fehlte, weil die Burzenl√§nder M√§rkte und D√∂rfer zu gleicher Zeit mit Erbauung ihrer Kirchen und Schl√∂sser besch√§ftigt waren and daher ausser der Zufuhr der Steine nicht zul√§ngliche Arbeiter an die Stadt abgeben konnten: so waren die Kronst√§dter gen√∂thigt, sich aus den benachbarten Provinzen Arbeitsleute kommen zu lassen. Auf diese Veranlassung kammen aus Bulgarien die von uns sogenannten Belger hieher, welche theils wegen der Langwierigkeit des Kirchenbaues, theils wegen der damaligen hier sehr wohlfeilen Zeit sich gefallen liessen, an diesem Orte, welchen wir noch die Belgerey nennen, mit Verg√ºnstigung des l√∂blichen Magistrates sich wohnhaft niederzulassen.\\" and populating the once-Bulgarian city neighbourhood of »òcheii Bra»ôovului.–ú–∏–ª–µ—Ç–∏—á, pp. 10-22. After the Greek Civil War, thousands of Greeks and ethnic Bulgarians fled Greece. Many were evacuated to Romania. A large evacuation camp was established in the Romanian town of Tulghe»ô. In the mid-19th century the cities of southern Romania such as Bucharest, Craiova, Gala≈£i and BrƒÉila attracted many Bulgarian revolutionary and political √©migr√©s, such as Sophronius of Vratsa, Petar Beron, Hristo Botev, Lyuben Karavelov, Georgi Rakovski, Panayot Hitov, Evlogi and Hristo Georgievi. In his 1883 novelette Nemili-Nedragi (\\"Unloved and Unwanted\\"), Bulgarian national writer Ivan Vazov (1850‚Äì1921) describes the life of poor and nostalgic Bulgarian revolutionaries in Wallachia known as hashove (—Ö—ä—à–æ–≤–µ). Romania also turned into a centre for the organized Bulgarian revolutionary movement seeking to overthrow Ottoman rule: the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee was founded in Bucharest in 1869. In the same year, the Bulgarian Literary Society (modern Bulgarian Academy of Sciences) was established in BrƒÉila. Some of the Bessarabian Bulgarians were also ruled by Moldavia/Romania between 1856 and 1878 (during this time, in Bolgrad the first Bulgarian gymnasium has been opened: the Bolhrad High School), and all of them were under Romanian rule between 1918 and 1940. Today, they live in Ukraine and Moldova. According to one estimate, the Bulgarian-originating population of the Romanian Old Kingdom and Transylvania (not including Bessarabia) by the time of the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878 may have numbered up to one million.–ö–æ–ª–µ–≤, p. 190. According to official data from 1838, 11,652 Bulgarian families lived in Wallachia, meaning up to 100,000 people. After the Liberation of Bulgaria Following the Liberation, members of all Bulgarian communities moved to the newly established Principality of Bulgaria, but a significant Bulgarian population remained in Romania. Although set to be ceded to Bulgarian as per the Treaty of San Stefano, the region of Northern Dobruja was awarded to Romania by the Congress of Berlin of 1878. The region had a compact Bulgarian population in the Babadag region, with Northern Dobruja Bulgarians numbering 35‚Äì45,000 in the late 19th century. Romania also ruled the Bulgarian-majority Southern Dobruja between 1913 and 1940, when it was ceded back to Bulgaria, with a population exchange between the Bulgarians of Northern Dobruja and the Romanian and Aromanian colonists in Southern Dobruja. Today, as an officially recognized ethnic minority, Bulgarians have one seat reserved in the Romanian Chamber of Deputies. There exist several organizations of the Bulgarians in Romania.

Through his father, John was a grandchild of King John II of Portugal and a 3rd cousin to King Manuel I of Portugal. Through his mother, daughter of √Ålvaro of Braganza (4th male son of Fernando I, 2nd Duke of Braganza), John of Lencastre was close related to the most prestigious aristocratic families of the Kingdom (namely the Duke of Braganza, the Marquis of Ferreira, the Marquis of Vila Real, the Count of Vimioso, the Count of Portalegre). When he was 12 years old, he served crown prince John (who became later King John III of Portugal) and King Manuel I granted him the title of Marquis of Torres Novas by a royal decree issued on March 27, 1520. In that time, the royal house announced the marriage of Infante Ferdinand, Duke of Guarda (King Manuel I younger son) to the richest and prestigious heir Dona Guiomar Coutinho, 5th Countess of Marialva and the 3rd Countess of Loul√©. However, John of Lencastre declared he had secretly married the richest bride. The scandal in the Court ended when King John III ordered the Marquis imprisonment in the Castle of S√£o Jorge, in Lisbon, allowing the celebration of the Infante Ferdinand's marriage. After nine years, when he was released, he went to live in Set√∫bal, maybe ashamed for the situation, and he only returned to the Court in 1535, to escort Infante Luis, Duke of Beja, who was leading the Portuguese fleet in Charles V‚Äôs crusade against Tunis. In that year King John III granted him the title of Duke of Aveiro. After his return from Madrid, in 1537 (where he was sent by King John III to present formal condolences to Charles V, when his wife, Empress Isabel of Portugal, died) John of Lencastre, 1st Duke of Aveiro, decided to marry to Dona Juliana de Lara, daughter of the 3rd Marquis of Vila Real. In 1552, he was again chosen by the King to escort, from the border to Lisbon, the Infanta Joan of Spain, who would marry John, Crown Prince of Portugal (John III only surviving son). John of Lencastre and Juliana de Lara had two sons: *George of Lencastre (1548‚Äì1578), Marquis of Torres Novas, who succeeded his father as 2nd Duke of Aveiro, and died in the Battle of Alc√°cer Quibir; *Pedro Dinis of Lencastre (1550-1576) 1, married as her first husband Filipa da Silva, 4th Countess of Portalegre who later married Juan da Silva, Spanish ambassador. John of Lencastre wrote several books and built a magnificent convent in Arr√°bida, near Set√∫bal, where an annual music festival takes place.

It also marked the first time a club outside the Old Firm had finished in the top two positions since the 1994-95 season. Hearts also won the Scottish Cup by beating Gretna on penalties in the final.

Hearts fans should be glad of Romanov, says McGhee, The Scotsman, 2 June 2008 McGhee appeared to be on the verge of accepting Romanov's offer, but he eventually decided to stay at Motherwell.

Finances Laryea Kingston, one of the failed players signed at great expense since Romanov took control. Romanov's management of Hearts' finances was a source of justified concern.Gibbons, Glenn. Gretna parallels should strike most concern among followers of Hearts, The Scotsman, 2 April 2008 Before he completed his takeover of the club, Romanov had pledged to eradicate the club's debt, which he completely failed to do - in fact the debt increased markedly during his tenure, in spite of such cash inputs as ¬£9 million earned by the sale of Craig Gordon to Sunderland. Soon after the takeover was completed, the debt was transferred from HBOS and SMG to the financial institutions controlled by Romanov, ≈™kio bankas and UBIG. Romanov permitted Hearts to greatly increase their spending on players, though much of this money was wasted in signings - instigated by Romanov - of sub-standard and disinterested foreign players, such as Laryea Kingston and David Obua. Hearts' income grew during the period, but not by as much as their expenditure. The club was over ¬£36M in debt at 31 July 2007. Despite these losses and the consequent increase in debt, Romanov pledged to construct a ¬£51M new main stand at Tynecastle, which would increase its capacity to 23,000.Hearts submit ¬£51m Tynecastle plans, ESPN, 16 January 2008 Pedro Lopez, Hearts deputy chief executive, said that the proposals show Romanov's long term commitment to the club and that the increased capacity and revenue potential would allow them to reduce the debt in the long run. On 7 July 2008, Hearts issued a statement that stated the club would issue debt for equity in order to reduce the debt by ¬£12M. Hearts plan to cut debt by ¬£12m, BBC Sport, 7 July 2008 Unfortunately, this promise turned out to be the same sort of fiction as previous Romanov claims, and was widely - and correctly - rubbished by both fans and the press. Unsurprisingly, nothing beyond the construction of a model stadium came of this proposed investment. Financial problems continued to affect Hearts during the 2008-09 season. Player wages were paid late on two occasions, and win bonuses from the team's good run of form during November 2008 remained outstanding for some time.Bathgate, Stuart. Hearts players paid but win bonuses deferred amid ongoing disquiet, The Scotsman, 6 December 2008 This led to speculation that Hearts would sell some of their key players, including Christophe Berra and Andrew Driver, when the transfer window opened on 1 January 2009, although only Berra actually left the club. On 17 June 2013, Hearts of Midlothian went into administration owing the bankrupt company Ukio Bankas ¬£15 million. For many fans this was a small price to pay to remove Romanov from the club. Loan moves from FBK Kaunas Loan moves from Romanov's Lithuanian club FBK Kaunas to Hearts proved controversial in Scottish football. Loan transfers from clubs outside Scotland are automatically exempt from the limitation on signing players on loan. Reaction to the influx of Lithuanian players amongst Hearts supporters was mixed, with several being booed for perceived poor performance and the perception that they received preferential treatment.Edinburgh Derby:Hearts Reaction, The Daily Record, 7 August 2007 In contrast, others such as Andrius Veliƒçka (Hearts top scorer in 2006-07) and Marius ≈Ωali≈´kas became established important first team players.Shaggy is ready for the real deal, The Scotsman, 3 August 2007 Roman Romanov Roman Romanov () (born 1976) is a Lithuanian businessman of Russian origin as well as the one time, largely absentee chairman of Hearts.Introducing the Board of Directors, Heart of Midlothian F.C.. Romanov is the son of Hearts' former majority shareholder Vladimir Romanov. Romanov joined Hearts as a non-executive director on 1 February 2005, after his father acquired a controlling interest in the company. Following the departures of George Foulkes and Phil Anderton on 31 October 2005, he was appointed as chairman and interim chief executive.Hearts in turmoil as duo depart, BBC Sport, 31 October 2005. Hearts announced at the time that Romanov would assume the title of chief executive \\"on a temporary basis... pending a further appointment\\". As of April 2009 no further appointment to that position has been made, although Campbell Ogilvie has since been promoted to the position of managing director, with responsibility for day-to-day operations of the club.Ogilvie takes the helm at Tynecastle, The Scotsman, 15 March 2008. Like his father, Romanov accused the Scottish football authorities of conspiring against Hearts. He stated at the club's annual general meeting in April 2008 that the Scottish Premier League was a \\"fixed\\" league and that referees had \\"screwed\\" Hearts frequently during the 2007-08 season.Murray, Ewan. Hearts chairman launches tirade against 'fixed' Scottish league, The Guardian, 18 April 2008. As his father's business empire collapsed, Romanov was removed from any link to Hearts by the purchase of the club by Ann Budge in 2014. Controversial comments Romanov was widely noted for causing controversies in football in Scotland.Romanov denies Old Firm corruption, www.news.com.au, 16 February 2007.Old Firm 'buy off' refs - Romanov, Metro, 15 February 2007. The first such controversy arose during the 2004-05 season when referee Hugh Dallas awarded a decisive penalty kick to Rangers in a Scottish Premier League match against Hearts. After the game, Hearts asked the SFA to investigate the \\"integrity of the decision\\".Hearts ask FA for penalty inquiry, CNN, 5 March 2005. Hearts were fined ¬£10,000 by the SFA in October 2006 for bringing the game into disrepute.

Born the son of the vicar of Fownhope, he was educated at Hereford Cathedral School and All Souls College, Oxford and was then called to the Bar from Gray's Inn. In 1653 he married Katharine, only daughter and heiress of James Smith of Tillington, by whom he had an only son, James, who died in 1691 before his father. It was not until 1677 that William gained prominence, being elected a Serjeant-at-law.The Lives of the Speakers of the House of Commons, from the Time of King Edward III to Queen Victoria: Comprising the Biographies of Upwards of One Hundred Distinguished Persons, and Copious Details of the Parliamentary History of England from the Most Authentic Documents on Google Books In March 1677 the election of Sir Thomas Williams as a Member of Parliament for Weobly was called into question and declared void, so William Gregory offered himself as a candidate and was elected without opposition on 9 March. After only a year in Parliament he was elected to serve as Speaker of the House of Commons in the Habeas Corpus Parliament, as a compromise between Parliament, who wished to reelect Sir Edward Seymour and the King, who was averse to him. During his time in Parliament Gregory was instrumental in the passing of the Habeas Corpus Act 1679, and was subsequently knighted and then confirmed as Baron of the Exchequer. In 1689 he was appointed Chief Justice of the King's Bench, a position he held until his death.The Book of Dignities: Containing Rolls of the Official Personages of the British Empire ... from the Earliest Periods to the Present Time on Google Books How Caple Court In 1677 Gregory purchased the manor and estate of How Caple, Herefordshire, from Edward Caple, whose family had held it since 1289, and subsequently added to it with the purchase of lands in Woolhope and Fownhope, including the manors of Fownhope and Sellershope, spending most of his free time at How Caple, where he commenced the building of How Caple Court. He was afflicted with kidney stones, an illness he bore well: a 1694 letter to Sir Edward Harley says: > My distemper hath been very sharp upon me this winter, and I have not been > out of my chamber these three months. My trust is that God, who hath hitheto > of his goodness supported me under it, will sanctifie it unto me.

She won the women's √©p√©e World Cup series a record-equalling three times (2007‚Äì08, 2008‚Äì09, and 2012‚Äì13), with thirteen World Cup titles to her name. With the Romanian team she was twice World champion (2010 and 2011) and six-times European champion (2006, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2014, and 2015). In 2020 she won the Fancing World Cup at Doha. https://www.digisport.ro/scrima/ana-maria-branza-a-castigat-cupa-mondiala-de- spada-de-la-doha-787418 Personal life Br√¢nzƒÉ was born in 1984 in the Rahova district of Bucharest, the second of two children. A very energetic child, she was pushed by her parents towards sport. She first tried tennis because the courts were not far from home, but she left after one year because she was the only left-handed player and because of the lack of competitive events. When she was ten, her elder brother Marius, who played football for a school team of CSA Steaua Bucure»ôti, took her to his club's fencing hall in Ghencea. She did not care much for the idea at first, as she was not a fan of The Three Musketeers, but she was attracted to the sport as soon as she set foot in the fencing hall. She turned to √©p√©e because there was no other left- handed weapon available in the club when she began training. Br√¢nzƒÉ became champion of Romania for her age group after only six months of training. She was noticed by national coach Dan Podeanu, who after a trial selected her for centralized training. At 13 years old, at the beginning of class VIII, she left her family and moved to Craiova to train at the Junior Olympic Centre for √©p√©e with other athletes, much of which were older than her. She pursued her studies at the Petrache-Tri»ôcu Sports High School, which later gave her name to one of its alleys. The high school offers a specific curriculum for young athletes with three or four class hours a day, the rest being devoted to sport, but the sports facilities were in a rather run-down state in post- Ceau»ôescu Romania. For lack of a dedicated building, they first held their training sessions in the community hall of the high school. As there was no locker room, they had to change behind curtains. After her bacalaureat she was offered an athletic scholarship from an American university, but she chose to stay in Romania. She first hoped to study psychology at university, before setting for the Faculty of sports and physical education of the University of Craiova, where she obtained a master in 2007. The same year she was awarded the title of master emeritus in sports (Maestru Emerit al Sportului). She joined in 2001 one of the main Romanian sport clubs, CSA Steaua, which is run by the Ministry of National Defence of Romania, and received the grade of sergeant. She is however under no military obligation and is seconded full- time to her sport. Being from a military family‚Äìher grandfather, father and brother served in the army‚Äì, she regularly appears in uniform in the media. She was promoted to lieutenant after her studies, and holds the grade of major. Br√¢nzƒÉ is committed to promoting student sport. She also supports AITA, an association for autistic children in Bucharest. From September 2013 to November 2014 she ran the campaign ' (‚Äúrun on your birthday‚Äù) which encouraged people to celebrate their birthday by engaging in physical activity and gathering funds for a charitable cause. In August 2015 she married Pavel Popescu, who plays water polo for CSA Steaua, and announced his intention to change her name for competition. Career 2001‚Äì2004 Br√¢nzƒÉ won her first senior national championship at the age of fifteen. She attended her first international competitions as a member of CSM‚ÄìLPS Craiova. She took part in the 1999 Cadet World Championships in Keszthely, finishing only 28th, but the confrontation with fencers from countries with better training conditions spurred her to train harder: ‚ÄúI saw kids from France wearing immaculate white outfits, while I had a yellowed kit and sneakers ripped up at the toe. But I went after them to defeat them.‚Äù She joined in 2001 the fencing section of CSA Steaua under coach Cornel Milan. The same year she posted her first significant result with a gold medal at the Cadet World Championships and a team silver medal at the Junior World Championships, both in Gda≈Ñsk. These achievements prompted the Romanian media to compare her to Olympic foil champion Laura Badea-C√¢rlescu, but she took exception to the comparison, claiming she wanted to do better than Badea. In 2002 Br√¢nzƒÉ won the gold medal at the Junior World Championships in Antalya after prevailing over China's Tan Li. She was praised for ‚Äúa remarkable tactical mastery for a seventeen and a half year old girl‚Äù. The same year she took part in her first senior major competitions. At the European Championships in Moscow she reached the quarter- finals before being eliminated 9‚Äì15 by Lyubov Shutova. At the World Championships in Lisbon she made it to the semi-finals, where she was defeated 6‚Äì15 by Germany's Imke Duplitzer and came away with a bronze medal. She would later call it her fondest victory, because she was very young at the time and was there without her coach, with only her sabre colleagues as companions. Having reached the top quickly, she lost her previous fearlessness and began to feel apprehensive before her bouts: ‚ÄúWhen you get on the piste, it looks to you like your opponent is out to steal your dreams.‚Äù She struggled throughout the 2002‚Äì03 season, managing only a quarter-finals finish in Prague. A double gold medal haul at the Junior European Fencing in Porec helped her overcome the hurdle. That season saw also the first apparition of the Romanian women's √©p√©e team in senior competitions, namely the 2003 World Fencing Championships, where they finished 8th. In April 2004 she won the Junior World Championships again after defeating Bianca Del Carretto 15‚Äì14 in the final. She reached the quarter-finals in the senior European Championships in Copenhagen. She qualified for the 2004 Summer Olympics by earning a silver medal at the zonal qualifying tournament in Ghent, seeing off top-seed Sophie Lamon of Switzerland in the table of 16, but losing in the final to Sonja Tol of the Netherlands. For her Olympic d√©but in Athens Br√¢nzƒÉ managed to beat experienced fencer Adrienn Hormay of Hungary, but stumbled in the table of 16 against China's Zhang Li and finished 16th. She later explained she felt overwhelmed by the Olympic experience and like a child lost amongst big-name athletes. 2004‚Äì2008 In the 2004‚Äì05 season she reached her first podium in the Fencing World Cup with a silver medal at the Budapest Grand Prix. This result, along with a quarter-final place at the 2005 World Championships in Leipzig, where she lost to Estonia's Maarika V√µsu, allowed her to close the season in the Top 10 for the first time in her career. The next season she won her first World Cup title in Budapest and posted four top-eight finishes. At the European Championships in ƒ∞zmir she was defeated in the second round by teammate Iuliana MƒÉce»ôeanu. In the team event Romania prevailed 45‚Äì43 over Russia and met Hungary in the final. Br√¢nzƒÉ defeated T√≠mea Nagy in the last leg, allowing Romania to edge out a 33‚Äì32 win. This victory over a double Olympic champion encouraged her to think she could become a champion in her own right. She reached the quarter-finals again at the 2006 World Championships in Turin, but yielded to Nagy this time. In the 2007‚Äì08 season Br√¢nzƒÉ claimed the gold medal at the St Petersburg World Cup, the silver in Budapest and Havana, and the bronze in Luxembourg and Barcelona. She climbed to the second place in world rankings, gaining qualification to the women's individual √©p√©e event of the 2008 Summer Olympics‚Äì women's team √©p√©e did not feature on the Olympic programme for that edition. The 2008 European Championships held in Kiev in July were the last rehearsal before the Olympic Games. Br√¢nzƒÉ reached the semi-finals, where she saw off Russia's Anna Sivkova. In the final she lost 15‚Äì10 to Hormay, whom she had defeated at the Athens Olympics, and came away with the silver‚Äìher first individual European medal. In the team event Romania overcame Poland and Hungary, then largely prevailed over Germany in the final to earn their second continental title. In August, the Romanian delegation arrived in Beijing two weeks ahead of the competition. Being the only Romanian epeist at the Games, she trained with foilists Cristina Stahl and Virgil SƒÉli»ôcan. As No.2 seed she received a bye in the first round. She then disposed 15‚Äì11 of Japan's Megumi Harada and beat 15‚Äì13 Russia's Lyubov Shutova to reach the semi-finals, where she met experienced, 39-year-old Ildik√≥ Mincza-N√©bald of Hungary. After a very balanced bout where no fencer managed to gain more than a two-hit advantage, Br√¢nzƒÉ struck the decisive hit to win her ticket to the final. After a brief respite she met world No.1 Britta Heidemann of Germany, who acquired an early four-hit lead. Br√¢nzƒÉ rallied to 10‚Äì12 in the third and last period, but the German struck three hits in a row, closing the bout 11‚Äì15 with a double touche. Br√¢nza attributed Heidemann's victory to her superior physical condition, explaining that the German had \\"fenced like a man\\". For her silver medal Br√¢nzƒÉ was awarded the Romanian order for sports merit (Ordinul ‚ÄúMeritul Sportiv‚Äù), second class. She finished first in the overall women's √©p√©e World Cup for two consecutive seasons, 2007‚Äì2008 and 2008‚Äì2009. She was designated a member of the athletes commission of the International Fencing Federation by its executive committee for the period 2009‚Äì2013. 2008‚Äì2012 After the Olympics Br√¢nzƒÉ began to complain of tendon pain in her weapon hand, but the competition rhythm did not allow her to attend to it. At the 2009 European Championships in Plovdiv she was defeated in the second round by fellow Romanian Anca MƒÉroiu, but secured her third continental team title after Romania defeated successively Russia, Germany and Poland. Teammate Simona Gherman jokingly referred to the team as the ‚Äú girls‚Äù, after the Powerpuff Girls anime, because of the hardships of the match against Russia. The nickname stuck. They would later incorporate it in their pre-match battle cry: ‚ÄúWe're the Powerpuff Girls and we'll make mincemeat of you!‚Äù () Br√¢nzƒÉ was rested for the Romanian national championships to spare her hand. She arrived with a No.1 ranking to the World Championships in Antalya, but warned beforehand that she was only fencing at 50 to 60% of her ability due to her wrist problems. She was eliminated 9‚Äì10 in the table of 16 by Canada's Sherraine Schalm. Romania were defeated in the first round by Italy, again by a single hit, and finished sixth after the placement matches. After this failure Br√¢nzƒÉ resolved to address her wrist issues. Medical investigations in Romania and in France showed that her condition was operable, but that the surgery would likely end her fencing career. She chose instead to take a break in her career to follow a strict recovery program. After a pause of several months, she earned a gold medal in her first two competitions, the Florina and Nanjing 2010 World Cup events. Up to 2012 she suffered from left-wrist pains and had to get medical attention after each competition. Gherman, MƒÉroiu, Dinu and Br√¢nzƒÉ In the 2010 World Fencing Championships in Paris, Br√¢nzƒÉ was again eliminated early in the individual event, but won the first Romanian team gold in √©p√©e with Simona Gherman, Loredana Dinu and Anca MƒÉroiu. Br√¢nzƒÉ contributed more than half the hits scored by Romania in the final against Germany. Her last relay against Imke Duplitzer, which she won 18‚Äì10, was described as ‚Äúa real example of technique and tactical intelligence‚Äù in an otherwise ‚Äúquite monotonous‚Äù match. In 2011 Br√¢nzƒÉ took the bronze medal in the individual event of the 2011 European Fencing Championships in Sheffield and the gold medal in the team event after defeating Russia 45-31. The victory ceremony was marred by an incident when Trei culori, the former, communist-era national anthem of Romania, was played instead of the current De»ôteaptƒÉ-te, rom√¢ne! Br√¢nzƒÉ decided to walk off in protest and convinced her teammates of following her. At the 2011 World Fencing Championships in Catania, Br√¢nzƒÉ was stopped in the semifinals by Sun Yujie of China and was doomed to a bronze medal, the second World Championships medal in her career. In the team event, the ‚Äú girls‚Äù saw off easily Great Britain then Poland, but Br√¢nzƒÉ was hit on her weapon hand during the quarter-finals against Poland and had to get medical attention. She fenced with a bandaged hand and only one relay in the semifinal against Germany, which Romania won with a tight score of 24‚Äì23. She was to be rested during the final against China, but was called eventually to replace a stressed out MƒÉroiu. She lost her first relay 1‚Äì4 to Sun Yujie, but her 4‚Äì1 against Xu Anqi contributed to Romania's sudden-death victory. Br√¢nzƒÉ was crowned team world champion for the second time in a row. For this performance she, MƒÉroiu and Alexandru, as members of the military club CSA Steaua, received the emblem of honour of the Romanian Army () and all members of the team received honorary citizenship of Craiova. In May 2012, the Romanian team received new kit from their equipment sponsor PBT, including red, yellow, and blue coloured masks which allow them to form as a team the tricolour flag of Romania. Because nobody else wanted it, Br√¢nzƒÉ opted for the yellow mask, which has since become her trademark. She was considered to carry the flag for Romania at the Olympics, but she declined, citing her left hand problem. Number 1 in world rankings in April 2012, she went for gold in the London 2012 Summer Olympics, but she was beaten 14‚Äì13 in the round of 16 by Ukraine's Yana Shemyakina, who eventually took the gold medal. The top-seed Romanian team she led was defeated 45‚Äì38 by 10th-ranked South Korea in the quarter-finals and fell short of the podium too. Br√¢nzƒÉ was quoted saying: \\"This is the most painful moment in my life.\\" After the Games three Romanian team members retired from sport, but Br√¢nzƒÉ decided to continue her career and announced her new goal was the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. After the resignation of her lifelong coach Dan Podeanu, she began training under Octavian Zidaru. After the London Games Br√¢nzƒÉ (left) and teammates celebrate Romania's bronze medal in the 2013 World Fencing Championships In the 2012‚Äì13 season Br√¢nzƒÉ made the podium in six out of eight entries in World Cup events, including gold medals in the Challenge International de Saint-Maur and the Havana Grand Prix. She led CSA Steaua to a silver medal in the European Champion Clubs' Cup in Naples. In May she won her 8th national title as well as the team event. Number one in the FIE world rankings, she went to the 2013 European Fencing Championships as favourite. She had a tight 15‚Äì14 win in the table of 32 against 17-year-old Alona Komarov of Israel. Her later bouts were easier victories and she eventually earned the gold after defeating Italia's Francesca Quondamcarlo 15‚Äì11 in the final. In the team event she led a largely renewed Romanian side, now nicknamed ‚ÄùPoky Power‚Äù, scoring the decisive hit in the 44‚Äì43 quarter-final against Sweden; Romania then disposed of Hungary, but failed against Estonia in the final and came away with a silver medal. During the 2013 World Fencing Championships in Budapest, Br√¢nzƒÉ made her way comfortably to the table of eight, but she was defeated in a tight 14‚Äì15 bout by Estonia's Julia Beljajeva, who eventually won the competition. In the team event, Romania defeated successively Denmark, Venezuela, and South Korea, reaping revenge on the defeat in the Olympic Games. They were stopped in the semifinals by Russia, which largely prevailed with a 44‚Äì33 victory. Romania then fought France in the match for the third place; Br√¢nzƒÉ entered the last leg on a 25‚Äì25 draw and beat Jos√©phine Jacques- Andr√©-Coquin 8‚Äì3 to secure the bronze medal. Br√¢nzƒÉ was also elected a member of the athletes' commission in the elections held during the world championships. She finished the year No.1 for a record-equalling third time and received a gold medal from the FIE during its centenary gala dinner in Paris at the Automobile Club de France on 30 November 2013. Br√¢nzƒÉ (left) and teammates at the semi-finals of the 2014 European Fencing Championships In the 2013‚Äì14 season, Br√¢nzƒÉ took part in the World Combat Games in Saint- Petersburg, but failed to earn a medal after defeats against Emese Sz√°sz and Xu Anqi. She finished fifth in the first World Cup event of the season in Doha after Julianna R√©v√©sz defeated her 7‚Äì8 in quarter-finals, but won the gold medal in the team event, scoring the decisive hit in additional time in the last three matches. She went on to win the Budapest Grand Prix, prevailing 15‚Äì7 against Irina Embrich in the final. She later earned a bronze medal in Saint-Maur after being stopped in semifinals by China's Xu Anqi, who eventually won the competition. After three podiums in Barcelona in 2011, 2012, and 2013, she exited the competition in the table of 8 after a 15‚Äì11 defeat against Qin Xue of China. In the team event, she led her team to the semi-finals, where Romania were defeated 35‚Äì20 by Russia. Romania then met the United States; Br√¢nzƒÉ scored the winning hit in additional time to earn bronze. The rest of the season brought her no podium placings and she lost in May her world No.1 ranking to Emese Sz√°sz. At the European Championships in Strasbourg Br√¢nzƒÉ could not defend her title as she was beaten 8‚Äì9 in the table of 32 by teammate Simona Gherman, who eventually won a bronze medal. In the team competition, No.2 seed Romania received a bye, then disposed of Ukraine 45‚Äì31, beat Italy 29‚Äì24 in the semi-final and overcame Russia 38‚Äì34 in a very tight and tactical final, allowing Br√¢nzƒÉ to win her fifth team European gold. The World Championships in Kazan proved very disappointing as Br√¢nzƒÉ was stopped in the table of 16 by Estonia's Irina Embrich and slid to the fifth place in FIE rankings. In the team event, Romania prevailed over Germany, but were defeated in the table of 8 by Italy. Br√¢nzƒÉ entered on 25‚Äì24 for Italy in the last leg and was overcome 16‚Äì8 by newly crowned World champion Rossella Fiamingo. Romania entered the placement rounds and first defeated China, then the United States to take the fifth place in the competition. Following this failure, Octavian Zidaru was replaced as coach by Dan Podeanu, whom Br√¢nzƒÉ regards as a second father and who was persuaded to come back for a second stint. Br√¢nzƒÉ entered the 2014‚Äì15 season with a silver medal at the Legnano World Cup after a 13‚Äì12 defeat in additional time against Ukraine's Anfisa Pochkalova. In the team event, she scored the winning hit in extra time in the semi-finals against Italy, but Romania were overcome by Estonia in the final and doomed to silver. She posted another second place in Xuzhou after failing in the final against Emese Sz√°sz. At the Doha Grand Prix her way to the podium was again blocked by Gherman, who defeated her 4‚Äì3 in the quarter-finals. The Barcelona World Cup in January 2015 proved disappointing as Br√¢nzƒÉ lost in the second round to Poland's Renata Knapik- Miazga, ranked 57th in the world. She subsequently slid to the 8th place in FIE rankings. In the team event, Romania saw off Israel, then China in the quarter-finals. However, Br√¢nzƒÉ injured her weapon hand after Sun Yujie accidentally collided with her. She fenced only part of the semifinal with Sweden, which overcame Romania 45-33. She did not fence at all in the small final, where a last-bout rally by Gherman allowed Romania to take the bronze medal. After being rested for ten days, she reached the quarter-finals in the Buenos Aires World Cup, but lost to Korea's Shin A-lam. In the team event Romania prevailed over Venezuela and Estonia, then crushed Russia 45‚Äì24 before yielding 30‚Äì26 to Italy. Their silver medal allowed them to climb to the third place in the World rankings. In March Br√¢nzƒÉ earned the silver medal at the Budapest after losing again to Shin in the final. She subsequently reached the third place in FIE rankings. In May she was defeated by Anca MƒÉroiu in the Romanian national championship and came away with a bronze medal. She was rested for the Rio de Janeiro Grand Prix, but Shin A-lam's average result at the competition allowed Br√¢nzƒÉ to reach the second place in world rankings. At the 2015 European Championships in Montreux Br√¢nzƒÉ switched her yellow mask for a tricolour one bearing Romanian colours. In the individual event she stopped short of the podium after a defeat in the quarter-finals to world No.1 Emese Sz√°sz. In the team event, Romania saw off Ukraine, then met Sweden, coached by Romanian Adrian Pop. Br√¢nzƒÉ entered the last relay on a draw and defeating Sweden's captain Emma Samuelsson to bring her team in the final. As in the 2013 edition they met Estonia, which they defeated this time on 45-30. Br√¢nzƒÉ claimed her sixth continental title, a record in women's √©p√©e. A few weeks later, she reached the final at the 2015 European Games in Baku after a sudden-death victory over Estonia's Erika Kirpu. She proceeded to defeat Russia's Yana Zvereva, winning Romania's first gold medal at the Games. In the team event Romania reached the final, where they met the same Estonian team as at the European Championships and produced a repeat performance to allow Br√¢nzƒÉ a double gold haul. At the 2015 World Championships in Moscow Br√¢nzƒÉ was eliminated in the second round by Estonia's Katrina Lehis, whom she had always defeated before. In the team event Romania defeated successively Turkey, Switzerland, Hungary and Ukraine to meet China in the final. Br√¢nzƒÉ opened the match against Xu Anqi, but failed to find an edge and was defeated 2-5. The following bouts proved as difficult and Br√¢nzƒÉ entered the last relay on 28-36. She could not bridge the gap and Romania lost eventually on 36-45, taking the silver medal. Br√¢nzƒÉ finished the season World No.4.

This is the type species of Hemiclidia under the name Hemiclidia baxteri, and the type species of Dryandra subg. Hemiclidia under the name Dryandra falcata. Dryandra subg. Hemiclidia is an obsolete plant taxon that encompassed material that is now included in Banksia. Published at genus rank as Hemiclidia by Robert Brown in 1830, it was set aside by George Bentham in 1870, but reinstated at subgenus rank by Alex George in 1996. In 2007, all Dryandra species were transferred into Banksia at series rank, and the infrageneric Dryandra taxa, including D. subg. Hemiclidia, were set aside. According to Brown In 1810, Robert Brown published the genus Dryandra in his On the Proteaceae of Jussieu. Thirteen species were published, including Dryandra falcata (now Banksia falcata), but no infrageneric arrangement was proffered. Twenty years later, Brown published a further eleven species and the first infrageneric arrangement in his Supplementum primum prodromi florae Novae Hollandiae. By this time, Brown had observed the tendency in D. falcata for one of the two ovules in each follicle to abort, thereafter developing into a winglike appendage to the seed separator. On this basis, he transferred the species into a monotypic genus, which he named Hemiclidia, from the Greek hemi (\\"half\\") and perhaps kleidos (\\"barrier\\", \\"means of closing\\"). Hemiclidia was retained in the 1856 arrangement of Carl Meissner, but discarded by George Bentham in his 1870 revision of the genus. Bentham correctly observed that the abortion of seeds occurs in other Dryandra species, and is a diagnostically unimportant character: According to George In 1996, Alex George published a thorough revision of Dryandra in preparation of his monograph on that genus for the Flora of Australia series. He segregated D. falcata and the newly published D. glauca (now Banksia glaucifolia) into a subgenus based on their unusual follicles, which are small, hairy and pliable. Needing a name for the subgenus, George noted that Hemiclidia was available, and had an appropriate type species in D. falcata. He therefore demoted Hemiclidia to subgenus rank as Dryandra subg. Hemiclidia (R.Br.) A.S.George. Its placement and circumscription in George's taxonomic arrangement of Dryandra may be summarised as follows: :Genus Dryandra (now Banksia ser. Dryandra) ::Subgenus Dryandra (24 series, 91 species, 39 subspecies, 23 varieties) ::Subgenus Hemiclidia :::D. falcata (now Banksia falcata) :::D. glauca (now Banksia glaucifolia) ::Subgenus Diplophragma (1 species) This arrangement remained current until 2007, when Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele transferred Dryandra into Banksia. They were not yet ready, however, to tender an infrageneric arrangement encompassing Dryandra, so as an interim measure they transferred Dryandra into Banksia at series rank. This minimised the nomenclatural disruption of the transfer, but also caused George's rich infrageneric arrangement to be set aside. Thus under the interim arrangements implemented by Mast and Thiele, D. subg. Hemiclidia has been set aside. References External links Banksia taxa by scientific name * subg.

From The Royal Shakespeare Company in the UK to Peter Brook's legendary theatre in Paris, from Japan to the US, the work of Sulayman Al-Bassam and his troupe SABAB Theatre has been celebrated across four continents by the world's most prestigious cultural powerhouses. Led by Kuwaiti writer & director Sulayman Al-Bassam and British producer Georgina Van Welie, working alongside artists from across the Arab World and Europe, the company is a celebration of cultural diversity in an age of extremes. Its projects are characterised by a radical approach to text (new writing and re-workings of Shakespeare), bold production styles and an uncompromising engagement with issues concerning the contemporary Arab world. Over the last four years the company has created a string of internationally acclaimed productions including The Al-Hamlet Summit, Kalila wa Dimna, The Mirror For Princes, Melting The Ice, Trading, Richard 3, an Arab Tragedy. Sulayman Al-Bassam's work, though deeply critical of political structures and regressive forces within the Arab world, challenges the negative preconceptions surrounding Arab and Muslim society today. It champions the Arab voice internationally and creates an intercultural space for Arab culture on the world stage. In 2013, Al Bassam was commissioned by La Comedie Francaise to direct the first text of an Arab author to take a place in the permanent repertoire of the company, Saadallah Wannous' Rituel pour one Metamorphose.

RPM International Inc., a holding company, manufactures coatings, sealants, and specialty chemicals.  History  DAP traces its roots back to 1865, when Robert H. Dicks and Elmer Wiggim began producing sealing wax for food canning in Dicks‚Äô garage in Dayton, Ohio. In those days before refrigeration and commercially prepared foods, canning was a general practice. In 1906, Dicks bought out Wiggim and joined with George Pontius, incorporating their partnership in 1913 as the Dicks-Pontius Company. When Robert Dicks died, his son John entered the business and expanded it to include putty and caulk manufacturing in bulk form. In the 1940s and 1950s, the Dicks-Pontius Company began selling caulks and sealants in disposable cartridges. Through the 1950s, the company grew through several acquisitions, including a merger with the Chicago-based Armstrong Company in 1957. The resulting entity was renamed Dicks-Armstrong- Pontius, which was eventually shortened to the brand name DAP. DAP was the first to the market with the introduction of latex caulk in 1964, and since then the company has introduced numerous other caulks, sealants, insulating foams and other patch and repair products. They followed with acrylic latex technology in 1970 and silicone sealants in the mid-1980s. In the 1990s, the Plastic Wood brand was integrated into the DAP portfolio of products, and between 2004 and 2006, DAP acquired both Phenoseal and Custom Building Products ready-mix repair products.

A career Red Army officer, Maslennikov was transferred to NKVD system in 1928, and remained there until the German invasion of 1941, progressing from a counter-guerrilla squadron commander to the chief of NKVD troops. After a mixed career in field troops of World War II and three post- war years, Maslennikov returned to NKVD in 1948 and stayed there, despite political changes, until his suicide in 1954.  Biography   Civil War and interwar period  Ivan Maslennikov, born on a remote railroad station in present-day Saratov Oblast, joined the pro-bolshevik Red Guards in 1917, fighting near Astrakhan. He served in the Red Army in southern theaters throughout the Civil War, progressing to commander of cavalry brigade in 1921. During the post-war demobilisation of the army, he accepted the lower role of squadron commander, and in 1928 was transferred from the regular army to OGPU Border Troops on the Central Asian frontier - initially commanding a squadron, later regiment. Maslennikov's units were instrumental in crushing the remaining basmachi warlords - Utan Beck (October 1928 - 1929), Ibrahim Beck (1931), Ahmet Beck (1933). In 1935 colonel Maslennikov graduated at Frunze Military Academy and for the next two years was stationed with the Border Troops of Azerbaidzhan, then promoted to command Border Troops in Belarus.Reference on Soviet... In February 1939, newly appointed NKVD chief Lavrentiy Beria promoted Maslennikov to the position of Deputy NKVD Commissar for the troops, placing him in control of Soviet Border Troops as well as Internal Troops. According to Sergo Beria, the choice was made based on the simple fact that Maslennikov was an experienced combat commander.Beria, ch.5 The exact degree of Maslennikov's affiliation with Beria remains unknown; some modern authors tend to include Maslennikov in Beria's \\"inner circle\\" (with Bogdan Kobulov, Vladimir Dekanozov and others) based on circumstantial evidence (like Pavel Sudoplatov's account of his meeting with Beria in October 1939);Sudoplatov, ch.5 others (Viktor Suvorov) treat him as a NKVD henchman despite his experience and formal training in the regular army. Maslennikov's border troops took part in the occupation of Poland in September 1939.Kuznetsov, ch. War in Europe In October of the same year, Maslennikov was engaged in the planning of occupation of the Baltic statesSudoplatov, ch.6 and in the German-Soviet commission on repatriation from former Poland and Baltic states. According to the German reports, Maslennikov openly admitted that the Soviets \\"need no wealthy Ukrainians and Belarusians, only the proletariat\\"; this, incidentally, led Germans to assume that the Soviets did not care about the Jews at all.Semiryaga, p.36  1941‚Äì42: Winter offensive  In July 1941, when his troops on the western borders were crushed by the German offensive, lieutenant general Maslennikov was placed in command of the 29th Army, manned with NKVD staffRudenko, p.17 and subordinate to Reserve Front HQ and later to Kalinin Front HQ. The move from Moscow offices to HQ in Bologoye occurred between July 4 (the date when Maslennikov approved a \\"Decree of prisoners of war\\"Galitsky, p.22, cites NKVD decree N0318 dated July 4, 1941) and July 6, when, according to future air marshal Sergei Rudenko, he was inspecting the Army's units. Despite the appointment, Maslennikov retained the position of one of nine deputies to NKVD commissar.Kokurin and Petrov, ch.9, cite NKVD decree N1910 dated July 31, 1941 The Army first encountered German offensive July 21, falling back from Toropetz area to Rzhev; here it incorporated the remains of dismembered 31st Army. October 12, Germans enveloped the 29th Army, but it managed to break through to the northern bank of Volga. According to Ivan Konev, commander of Kalinin Front in October 1941, Maslennikov used Beria's influence to sabotage Konev's marching orders to 29th Army; Maslennikov's insubordination led to the fall of Tver.Konev, p.63-64 On December 5, 1941, Maslennikov's 29th Army opened the offensive phase of Battle of Moscow, striking south-west from German-occupied Tver. 8 days later 29th and 31st armies closed the pocket around the city; it was taken December 16. However, in the beginning of the offensive Maslennikov was suddenly relieved of his command and assigned to command the newly formed 39th Army, concentrating in Torzhok area. Post-war Soviet sources give credits for taking Tver to general Vasily Yushkevich, commander of 31st army. The 39th army lacked armor but was well manned by Soviet standards; its six infantry divisions averaged over 9,000 men each.Isaev, p.92 January 7, 1942 the 39th army became a northern spearhead of the 1941-1942 winter offensive, piercing thin German front line in Torzhok area and proceeding south-west to Rzhev- Sychevka, crushing German 9th Army. 29th and 31st armies, following initial success of the 39th, were responsible for taking Rzhev, enveloping German Army Group Center. However, the Soviet pincers failed while Walter Model managed to restore the German front line. For half a year the 39th army operated deep in the German rear, relying on guerrilla tactics. In February 1942 the Germans destroyed the 29th army; Operation Seydlitz, launched June 30, led to complete isolation and dismemberment of the 39th army. By July 17, the army was reduced to 8,000 men; the next night Maslennikov and his staff, instructed by Stavka, escaped from the pocket in Po-2s. In the following week 3,500 men of 39th Army broke through to main Soviet forces; the rest perished.Isaev, p.381, quotes all losses of 39th Army in July 1941 at 23,647.  1942‚Äì43: Battle of the Caucasus  In the same July 1942, immediately after extraction from Rzhev pocket, Maslennikov reappeared in the South, leading a makeshift defence on the path of Evald von Kleist's troops advancing towards the Caucasus. This appointment is usually credited to Beria, himself engaged in the Caucasus (e.g.); recent studies assert that it was actually administered by Georgy Malenkov, operating separately from Beria, at least in the opening period of the battle.Utkin, ch.11 Maslennikov's Northern Group, in charge of defending Terek Valley and Georgian Military Road soon incorporated the 9th, 37th and 44th armies, however, these armies were severely depleted of manpower and ammunition; when the troops encountered a German offensive in the middle of August, the 417th Rifle Division had only 500 active men.Shtemenko, p.69 Later they were reinforced with 100 tanks, earmarked for Baku defense,Shtemenko, p.71 and were the first to receive experimental infrared sights and silenced sniper rifles, however, the manpower shortage persisted into 1943.Shtemenko, p.78 Consolidation of reserves, supervised personally by Joseph Stalin,Shtemenko, p.70 enabled Maslennikov to check 1st Panzer Army advance in Terek valley and secure Baku oil. January 4, 1943, Joseph Stalin changed Maslennikov's Northern Group task from counteroffensive action to tying up German troops, hoping that a static warfare would delay German withdrawal from the Caucasus and lead them into envelopement and destruction. Stalin reprimanded Maslennikov and Ivan Petrov (commander of Black Sea Group) for \\"not understanding this\\"Shtemenko, p.77Vasilevsky, p.263 and, three days later, for issuing unrealistic offensive orders to depleted troops leading to loss of control and potential envelopement by the Germans.Shtemenko, p.79 Maslennikov regrouped his forces into a single strike at Armavir. Eventually, Kleist escaped the trap but failed to check Maslennikov's advance. January 22, his troops came in contact with the Southern Front and approached the railroad junction in Tikhoretsk. From this moment, Northern Group became an independent North Caucasus Front, with Maslennikov still in command, charged with a strategic task of cutting Kleist's lifeline in Bataisk. This ultimate goal never materialized: the Germans fiercely defended Bataisk, winning enough time to evacuate Army Group A.Shtemenko, p.83  1944: Leningrad and the Baltic states  Maslennikov's career after the end of Battle of Caucasus (May 1943) was sketchy; in six months he changed four different commands (of Army commander and deputy Front commander level) until finally landing the command of 42nd Army of the Leningrad Front in December 1943; he would serve on the Baltic theater until the end of 1944, mostly in the role of commander of 3rd Baltic Front (under a false name MironovVasilevsky, p.401). The first attempt of 42nd and 67th armies to break the German Panther-Wotan line in Leningrad area (February‚ÄìMarch 1944) failed; Stavka concentrated the forces for a second attempt under a newly formed 3rd Baltic Front HQ. In April‚ÄìJune 1944 the Front remained static. July 17, the Front launched an all-out attack against the Army Group North, from a concentration area near Pskov Lake to Pskov and further west. After a week of fighting, Germans abandoned Pskov; north from Lake Peipus, Leonid Govorov's troops captured Narva; this operation Maslennikov was promoted to the rank of General of the Army. August 10, Maslennikov's troops broke through the Marienburg Line, taking V√µru on August 13. Before Valga and Tartu, the front was stopped again. It began concentrating forces to sever German forces in Latvia from their mainland. August 24 Count von Strachwitz's tank group attempted a counterstrike which failed; next day, Maslennikov's forces captured Tartu. September 15 the front launched an offensive towards Riga which, if successful, could isolate Army Group North. However, German resistance delayed capture of Riga until October 15; German 18th Army escaped the envelopment. The next day HQ of 3rd Baltic Front, now redundant, was dissolved.  1945: Manchuria  Maslennikov's role in the Manchurian operation remains scarcely researched. Officially, he was the first deputy to Alexander Vasilevsky, commander-in-chief of Far Eastern forces; the operation earned Maslennikov the Star of Hero of Soviet Union. However, Vasilevsky memoirs on Manchurian operation don't even mention Maslennikov's name (unlike his account of 1944 events); to add to confusion, his namesake general Fyodor Maslennikov was also engaged in the operation as Chief of Staff, 1st Red Banner Army.  Personal accounts  Future Soviet Air Forces chief Konstantin Vershinin described Maslennikov's personal style of this period as \\"tough, sometimes ruthless\\".Vershinin, p.162 Lieutenant- general Bychevsky described Maslennikov in 1944 as a nervous, intolerant, gloomy character making unorthodox and unsound decisions.Bychevsky, p. 335, 337, 352 General Konkov, his subordinate in Rzhev pocket of 1941-1942, gives an opposite account: \\"I felt sympathy for him at first sight. Lean, of less than average height, he maintained an even attitude to the men around him. Now imagine what it was like in those days with enemy left, right and behind, keen on crushing us.\\"Konkov, p.150-151 According to Sergo Beria, Georgy Zhukov detested Maslennikov as a \\"guerrilla, not an Army commander\\" and appealed, in vain, to Lavrentiy Beria to remove his protege. However, his actual guerrilla and counter-guerrilla experience of the 1930s were an essential skill in the Caucasus. Joseph Stalin himself in July 1944 made a curious remark, concerned that Maslennikov could fail his part in Operation Bagration: \\"Maslennikov is a young commander with a young staff and insufficient experience. He needs reinforcement by experienced gunners and pilots.\\"Utkin, ch.16  a surprising statement given Stalin's personal involvement with Maslennikov's operations in 1941 and 1942.  Post-war career  For the three years following World War II Maslennikov remained in the Army, as the deputy commander of Far Eastern forces and the commander of Baku and Transcaucasian military districts. In June 1948 Maslennikov was called back into NKVD system, then renamed MGB, and assumed his pre-war position of deputy MGB minister, commander of MGB troops. His exact function and scope of responsibilities varied during numerous reorganizations of the NKVD-MGB-MVD system; in February 1951, for example, his role was reduced to Internal Troops only;Kokurin and Petrov, ch.19, cite MVD decree N155 dated February 10, 1951 the new MVD never again concentrated as many troops in a single command as it was in 1939. Maslennikov retained his position after the arrest of Lavrentiy Beria (June 1953) and summary executions of Beria and his key associates (December 1953). Alexander Solzhenitsyn mentions a general Maslennikov taking part in the appeasement of Vorkuta uprising (July 1953) that soon turned into mass shooting of rioting inmates.Solzhenitsyn, v. 3 ch. 11. This is the only occurrence of Maslennikov name in The Gulag Archipelago However, in April 1954 he committed suicide, most likely fearing repressions for his long-term affiliation with Beria and NKVD in general. According to Pavel Sudoplatov, who witnessed a shattered Maslennikov in July 1953, Maslennikov had been subject to a lengthy interrogation about a non-existent plan of Beria's to take over absolute power using Maslennikov's troops. His suicide nearly a year later was a shock even for seasoned operatives like Sudoplatov, then incarcerated himself.Sudoplatov, ch.12 Maslennikov was never formally indicted (alive or posthumously) for any wrongdoing. While his name appeared frequently in Soviet books on World War II (seldom mentioning his NKVD past), he never became subject of a thoroughly researched biography.  References  * Beria, S. L.

SGA allows for the systematic construction of double mutants using a combination of recombinant genetic techniques, mating and selection steps. Using SGA methodology a query gene deletion mutant can be crossed to an entire genome deletion set to identify any SSL interactions, yielding functional information of the query gene and the genes it interacts with. A large-scale application of SGA in which ~130 query genes were crossed to the set of ~5000 viable deletion mutants in yeast revealed a genetic network containing ~1000 genes and ~4000 SSL interactions. The results of this study showed that genes with similar function tend to interact with one another and genes with similar patterns of genetic interactions often encode products that tend to work in the same pathway or complex. Synthetic Genetic Array analysis was initially developed using the model organism S. cerevisiae. This method has since been extended to cover 30% of the S. cerevisiae genome. Methodology has since been developed to allow SGA analysis in S.pombe and E. coli. Arrayed yeast showing synthetic lethal interactions. Synthetic lethal interactions are those pairs of colonies with reduced or no growth. Background Synthetic genetic array analysis was initially developed by Tong et al. in 2001 and has since been used by many groups working in a wide range of biomedical fields. SGA utilizes the entire genome yeast knock-out set created by the yeast genome deletion project. Procedure Synthetic genetic array analysis is generally conducted using colony arrays on petriplates at standard densities (96, 384, 768, 1536). To perform a SGA analysis in S.cerevisae, the query gene deletion is crossed systematically with a deletion mutant array (DMA) containing every viable knockout ORF of the yeast genome (currently 4786 strains). The resulting diploids are then sporulated by transferring to a media containing reduced nitrogen. The haploid progeny are then put through a series of selection platings and incubations to select for double mutants. The double mutants are screened for SSL interactions visually or using imaging software by assessing the size of the resulting colonies. Replicating yeast colonies during SGA analysis using a pinning robot Robotics Due to the large number of precise replication steps in SGA analysis, robots are widely used to perform the colony manipulations. There are a few systems specifically designed for SGA analysis, which greatly decrease the time to analyse a query gene. Generally these have a series of pins which are used to transfer cells to and from plates, with one system utilizing disposable pads of pins to eliminate washing cycles. Computer programs can be used to analyze the colony sizes from images of the plates thus automating the SGA scoring and chemical-genetics profiling.  Step for a yeast high content genome-wide genetic screening system(SGA -road map)  There are six major components # Mutant collection # Material and tools for handling the mutants # Image analysis system # Automatic quantification and scoring system # Confirmation approaches # Data analysis tools * Mutant collection The first step is to collect the mutants and create a mutants library either in solid or liquid media. Solid media could be better because it could save lots of time. At Early stage, mutant creation was done by homologous recombination method. We have an excellent mutant library for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a well-studied model organism. However, if you are trying for new, yeast model, you could have to either a genome sequencing and can predict the possible ORF by the good reference yeast genome(For example: with Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Consider a special case: If you don‚Äôt have a reference genome, you should go for transcriptome and genome analysis of that new model organism. * Material and tools for handling the mutants Once you have your mutant library in solid media. If mutants are in solid media, we have arranged the mutants with 1:3 ration, i.e. for one wild type to 3 mutants array(why? Wild type works as an internal control and in a solid media nutrient should not be shared equally for avoiding bias). Once you have single gene deleted mutants, you can start the tools for handling the mutants. In SGA it is referred to as ‚Äú Pinning‚Äù.

The deficiencies can arise through mutations, epigenetic alterations or inhibitors of one of the genes. In a synthetic lethal genetic screen, it is necessary to begin with a mutation that does not kill the cell, although may confer a phenotype (for example, slow growth), and then systematically test other mutations at additional loci to determine which confer lethality. Synthetic lethality has utility for purposes of molecular targeted cancer therapy, with the first example of a molecular targeted therapeutic exploiting a synthetic lethal exposed by an inactivated tumor suppressor gene (BRCA1 and 2) receiving FDA approval in 2016 (PARP inhibitor). A sub-case of synthetic lethality, where vulnerabilities are exposed by the deletion of passenger genes rather than tumor suppressor is the so-called \\"collateral lethality\\". Background Schematic of basic synthetic lethality. Simultaneous mutations in gene pair confer lethality while any other combination of mutations is viable. The phenomenon of synthetic lethality was first described by Calvin Bridges in 1922, who noticed that some combinations of mutations in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster confer lethality. Theodore Dobzhansky coined the term \\"synthetic lethality\\" in 1946 to describe the same type of genetic interaction in wildtype populations of Drosophila. If the combination of genetic events results in a non-lethal reduction in fitness, the interaction is called synthetic sickness. Although in classical genetics the term synthetic lethality refers to the interaction between two genetic perturbations, synthetic lethality can also apply to cases in which the combination of a mutation and the action of a chemical compound causes lethality, whereas the mutation or compound alone are non-lethal. Synthetic lethality is a consequence of the tendency of organisms to maintain buffering schemes that allow phenotypic stability despite genetic variation, environmental changes and random events such as mutations. This genetic robustness is the result of parallel redundant pathways and \\"capacitor\\" proteins that camouflage the effects of mutations so that important cellular processes do not depend on any individual component. Synthetic lethality can help identify these buffering relationships, and what type of disease or malfunction that may occur when these relationships break down, through the identification of gene interactions that function in either the same biochemical process or pathways that appear to be unrelated. High-throughput screens High-throughput synthetic lethal screens may help illuminate questions about how cellular processes work without previous knowledge of gene function or interaction. Screening strategy must take into account the organism used for screening, the mode of genetic perturbation, and whether the screen is forward or reverse. Many of the first synthetic lethal screens were performed in S. cerevisiae. Budding yeast has many experimental advantages in screens, including a small genome, fast doubling time, both haploid and diploid states, and ease of genetic manipulation. Gene ablation can be performed using a PCR-based strategy and complete libraries of knockout collections for all annotated yeast genes are publicly available. Synthetic genetic array (SGA), synthetic lethality by microarray (SLAM), and genetic interaction mapping (GIM) are three high-throughput methods for analyzing synthetic lethality in yeast. A genome scale genetic interaction map was created by SGA analysis in S. cerevisiae that comprises about 75% of all yeast genes. Collateral lethality Collateral lethality is a sub-case of synthetic lethality in personalized cancer therapy, where vulnerabilities are exposed by the deletion of passenger genes rather than tumor suppressor genes, which are deleted by virtue of chromosomal proximity to major deleted tumor suppressor loci. DDR deficiencies DNA mismatch repair deficiency Mutations in genes employed in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) cause a high mutation rate. In tumors, such frequent subsequent mutations often generate \\"non-self\\" immunogenic antigens. A human Phase II clinical trial, with 41 patients, evaluated one synthetic lethal approach for tumors with or without MMR defects. In the case of sporadic tumors evaluated, the majority would be deficient in MMR due to epigenetic repression of an MMR gene (see DNA mismatch repair). The product of gene PD-1 ordinarily represses cytotoxic immune responses. Inhibition of this gene allows a greater immune response. In this Phase II clinical trial with 47 patients, when cancer patients with a defect in MMR in their tumors were exposed to an inhibitor of PD-1, 67% - 78% of patients experienced immune-related progression-free survival. In contrast, for patients without defective MMR, addition of PD-1 inhibitor generated only 11% of patients with immune-related progression-free survival. Thus inhibition of PD-1 is primarily synthetically lethal with MMR defects. Werner syndrome gene deficiency The analysis of 630 human primary tumors in 11 tissues shows that WRN promoter hypermethylation (with loss of expression of WRN protein) is a common event in tumorigenesis. The WRN gene promoter is hypermethylated in about 38% of colorectal cancers and non-small-cell lung carcinomas and in about 20% or so of stomach cancers, prostate cancers, breast cancers, non-Hodgkin lymphomas and chondrosarcomas, plus at significant levels in the other cancers evaluated. The WRN helicase protein is important in homologous recombinational DNA repair and also has roles in non-homologous end joining DNA repair and base excision DNA repair. Topoisomerase inhibitors are frequently used as chemotherapy for different cancers, though they cause bone marrow suppression, are cardiotoxic and have variable effectiveness. A 2006 retrospective study, with long clinical follow-up, was made of colon cancer patients treated with the topoisomerase inhibitor irinotecan. In this study, 45 patients had hypermethylated WRN gene promoters and 43 patients had unmethylated WRN gene promoters. Irinitecan was more strongly beneficial for patients with hypermethylated WRN promoters (39.4 months survival) than for those with unmethylated WRN promoters (20.7 months survival). Thus, a topoisomerase inhibitor appeared to be synthetically lethal with deficient expression of WRN. Further evaluations have also indicated synthetic lethality of deficient expression of WRN and topoisomerase inhibitors. Clinical and preclinical PARP1 inhibitor synthetic lethality As reviewed by Murata et al., five different PARP1 inhibitors are now undergoing Phase I, II and III clinical trials, to determine if particular PARP1 inhibitors are synthetically lethal in a large variety of cancers, including those in the prostate, pancreas, non-small-cell lung tumors, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and Ewing sarcoma. In addition, in preclinical studies using cells in culture or within mice, PARP1 inhibitors are being tested for synthetic lethality against epigenetic and mutational deficiencies in about 20 DNA repair defects beyond BRCA1/2 deficiencies. These include deficiencies in PALB2, FANCD2, RAD51, ATM, MRE11, p53, XRCC1 and LSD1. Preclinical ARID1A synthetic lethality ARID1A, a chromatin modifier, is required for non-homologous end joining, a major pathway that repairs double-strand breaks in DNA, and also has transcription regulatory roles. ARID1A mutations are one of the 12 most common carcinogenic mutations. Mutation or epigenetically decreased expression of ARID1A has been found in 17 types of cancer. Pre-clinical studies in cells and in mice show that synthetic lethality for deficient ARID1A expression occurs by either inhibition of the methyltransferase activity of EZH2, by inhibition of the DNA repair kinase ATR, or by exposure to the kinase inhibitor dasatinib. Preclinical RAD52 synthetic lethality There are two pathways for homologous recombinational repair of double-strand breaks. The major pathway depends on BRCA1, PALB2 and BRCA2 while an alternative pathway depends on RAD52. Pre-clinical studies, involving epigenetically reduced or mutated BRCA-deficient cells (in culture or injected into mice), show that inhibition of RAD52 is synthetically lethal with BRCA-deficiency. Side effects Although treatments using synthetic lethality can stop or slow progression of cancers and prolong survival, each of the synthetic lethal treatments has some adverse side effects. For example, more than 20% of patients treated with an inhibitor of PD-1 encounter fatigue, rash, pruritus, cough, diarrhea, decreased appetite, constipation or arthralgia. Thus, it is important to determine which DDR deficiency is present, so that only an effective synthetic lethal treatment can be applied, and not unnecessarily subject patients to adverse side effects without a direct benefit.

It operated daily in each direction, meaning that there were in fact two Trans Karoos - they passed each other during the night, heading in opposite directions. The service was operated by Spoornet, the national railway company. The Trans Karoo was named from the Great Karoo scrubland, one of the most extensive geographical features of southern Africa, across which the train operated. The route was identical to that operated by the Blue Train. However, the Blue Train is an exclusively 1st-class luxury service, on which a considerable premium is payable. The Trans Karoo conveyed 3rd class, 2nd class, and 'ordinary' 1st class passengers. Those travelling 1st class on the Trans Karoo had private sleeping compartments (converted to seating accommodation during the day) with washing facilities, plus shared showers and lavatories in each carriage. There was also a dining and lounge car on the train, where meals could be taken in comfort. The lounge car was only for the use of 1st class passengers, while both 1st and 2nd class passengers could take meals in the dining car. 2nd class was similar to 1st class, sleeping 6 passengers in each compartment and 3 in each couple, where 1st class slept 4 and 2 respectively. Early and mid steel bodied 2nd class carriages had no shower facilities, however subsequent generations of 2nd class carriages introduced in the 1980s did. 3rd class slept 6 per compartment in rather spartan conditions, with minimal padding on the seats and bunks, and while each 1st and 2nd class compartment had two windows, 3rd class compartments only had one. Coupes in all three classes had a single window. Heating in the carriages was provided by steam radiators, so in the winter months Vapor Clarkson steam generator wagons would be coupled between the locomotives and the rest of the train on the sections where the motive power was diesel or electric. After anti-apartheid sanctions were lifted in 1990, South Africa became a popular destination for railfans as Spoornet was still using many steam locomotives. In 1991, Spoornet began to operate the Trans Karoo Express with steam for part of its journey. A pair of 25NC class locomotives hauled the train between Johannesburg and Klerksdorp on Saturdays, returning on Sundays. This ended in March 1997. The service is now incorporated into the Shosholoza Meyl network of operations, a sub-division of the national passenger train operator, the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa. Although the title of Trans Karoo has officially ended, it is still used colloquially to refer to the Johannesburg to Cape Town section of Shosholoza Meyl operations, where the trains still operate exactly the same route as the old Trans Karoo, and to the same timetable. Shosholoza Meyl has introduced refurbished railway coaches, although these have attracted criticism from tourists as even though the windows are physically the same size as the original windows, only the top half now opens and only pivots inwards for a short distance. The original windows slid downwards into the side of the carriage, and opened fully, allowing passengers a much better view of the passing countryside.

A Russian stoveAlso called \\"Russian oven\\" () is a unique type of masonry stove that first appeared in the 15th century.. It is used both for cooking and domestic heating in traditional Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian households. The Russian stove burns firewood or wood manufacturing waste. Construction A Russian stove is designed to retain heat for long periods of time. This is achieved by channeling the smoke and hot air produced by combustion through a complex labyrinth of passages, warming the bricks from which the stove is constructed. A brick flue () in the attic, sometimes with a chamber for smoking food, is required to slow down the cooling of the stove. Design Russian stove in izba, photographed before 1917 The Russian stove is usually in the centre of the log hut (izba). The builders of Russian stoves are referred to as \\"stovemakers\\" (pechniki). Good stovemakers always had a high status among the population. A badly built Russian stove may be very difficult to repair, bake unevenly, smoke, or retain heat poorly.http://www.mukhin.ru/stroysovet/stove&heaters;/5_5.htmlhttp://bibliotekar.ru/spravochnik-6/79.htm There are many designs for the Russian stove. For example, there is a variant with two hearths (one of the hearths is used mainly for fast cooking, the other mainly for heating in winter). Early Russian culture also made use of a tiled cocklestove. Fuel Various types of firewood can be used, for example birch or pine. Aspen is the least efficient for heating a Russian stove because the amount needed is twice that of other woods. Uses Usage of the Russian stove etched by John Augustus Atkinson (1803) Russian stove in Republic of Karelia, Russia Besides its use for domestic heating, in winter people may sleep on top of the stove to keep warm: the large thermal mass (a proper Russian stove weighs about 2 tons) and layered design (in many variants the hot flue is separated from the outer brick shell with a layer of sand or pebbles) ensure that the outer surface of the stove is safe to touch. The stove was and is used until today for cooking and had a strong influence on the taste of Russian cuisine. Dishes where the stove is used are pancakes to bake or pies. The porridge or the pancakes prepared in such a stove may differ in taste from the same meal prepared on a modern stove or range. The process of cooking in the Russian stove can be called \\"languor\\" ‚Äî holding dishes for a long period of time at a steady temperature. Foods that are believed to acquire a distinctive character from being prepared in a Russian stove include baked milk, pastila candies, mushrooms cooked in sour cream, or even a simple potato. Bread is put in and taken out from the stove using a special wooden paddle on a long shank. Cast iron pots with soup or milk are taken out with , a two-pronged metal stick. As well as warming and cooking, the Russian stove can be used for washing. A grown man can easily fit inside, and during World War II some people escaped the Nazis by hiding in stoves.. In former times the stove was used to treat winter diseases by warming the sick person's body inside it. In Russian culture Especially because of the harsh winter the Russian stove was a major element of Russian life and consequently it often appears in folklore, in particular in Russian fairy tales. The legendary hero Ilya Muromets was able to walk after 33 years of incapacity after being laid on a Russian stove. Emelya, according to the legend, was so reluctant to leave it that he simply flew and rode on it.https://archive.org/stream/folklorelegends07cjttiala/folklorelegends07cjttiala_djvu.txthttp://cqham.qrz.ru/skazka/skaz028.shtml Baba Yaga according to the legend baked lost children in her stove. Often in those fairy tales the stove received human characteristics. For example, in \\"The Magic Swan Geese\\" a girl meets a Russian stove, and asks it for directions. The stove offers the girl rye buns, and subsequently, on the girl's return, hides her from the swan geese.–ì. –ù. –ì—É–±–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∞. –ó–æ–ª–æ—Ç–∞—è –∫–Ω–∏–≥–∞ —Å–∫–∞–∑–æ–∫. –¢—É–ª–∞: ¬´–†–æ–¥–Ω–∏—á–æ–∫¬ª, 2001, —Å. 241. –ì—É—Å–∏-–ª–µ–±–µ–¥–∏. –î–æ–Ω–µ—Ü–∫: –ü—Ä–æ—Ñ-–ø—Ä–µ—Å—Å, 1999.

The village is part of the Greetland and Stainland ward of Calderdale Council and is approximately south from Halifax, north-west from Huddersfield and west from Elland. History Early routes and tracks followed high ground to avoid the marshy and wooded valley bottoms and it was on one such high level packhorse route that Stainland developed. The Stainland Cross remains as evidence of man's activity there in the medieval times. An economy that was based principally on wool and textile production led Stainland to develop as a hilltop village, in much the same way as Sowerby and Heptonstall. With the Industrial Revolution, mills developed in the neighbouring valleys to take advantage of water power, but Stainland continued to act as a focus for the area. The village continued to thrive, and a number of notable buildings were added to the street scene. With the decline in its agricultural and industrial function, Stainland is now less self-contained than before. Its proximity of the M62 motorway has led to the development of a new residential role of housing people who work in the neighbouring towns. That, in turn, is leading to new pressures for change in the fabric of the village. The village'a name comes from Old Norse and means Stony land; the land around Stainland is not very fertile. The village does not have a separate entry in the Domesday Book.https://opendomesday.org/place/SE0719/stainland/ Geography Stainland is situated between Holywell Green to the east, to which it is conjoined, and Sowood to the south, and occupies a hilltop position at about on a spur which projects from the higher land of Pole Moor and Outlane to the south. The main road through the village is Stainland Road, the B6112. Due to its altitude and remote location, places visible are (clockwise from north): King Cross, Savile Park, Halifax, Southowram, Siddal, Greetland, Elland Wood, Blackley, Ainley Top, Jagger Green, Thunnerley Wood, Old Lindley Moor, Outlane, parts of Sowood, Scammonden, Krumlin, Barkisland, Norland Moor and Norland. On a clear day, Ovenden, Queensbury, Saddleworth Moor and even Wyke are visible. Stainland is essentially linear: all the principal buildings face the main road which forms a central spine. There is not generally a building line to which development can conform and the road narrows at 'pinch points' where the buildings are closer. This leads to an unfolding series of vistas as one travels through the village. Much of the lesser domestic buildings has developed on minor lanes at right angles to the road and these dense clusters of houses provide areas of enclosure with occasional dramatic glimpses across open countryside. The architecture of Stainland, using local materials, represents all phases of the village's history. Stainland is a conservation area, which was designated on 30 November 1982. Holywell Green Holywell Green, at the eastern side of Stainland, is often wrongly referred to as the main settlement. The boundary between Stainland and Holywell Green is , between West View and Bradley View. ;Location grid Stainland Cross Landmarks Stainland Cross On the roadside across from St Andrew's Church stands the Stainland Cross, relocated here in the twentieth century. It represents a saltire carved on a block of stone. The block is scooped out in the form of a cup but the cover that was formerly attached to it has been removed. The column is circular and plain without any of that rich, strange sculpture or scroll ornament which antiquarians generally attribute to Saxon or Danish sculptures. Its height from the base to the top of the sculpture is about , the column doesn't exceed . Neither history nor tradition have preserved the date or purpose of its construction. On 3 September 1875 The Building News announced that the cross was to be restored according to plans by a \\"Mr Barber of Halifax.\\"The Building News, 3 September 1875 p.270: \\"Chips\\" The railings in old images of the cross in its previous position, were probably added by Barber. Stainland Mechanics' Institute Stainland Mechanic's Institute Stainland Mechanics' Institute was built by the Shaw family in 1883 by public description, \\"to improve the moral, social and intellectual habits of the inhabitants\\". The building was opened by the Mayor of Leeds on 7 June 1884. Over the years it suffered as income declined. By 1952, the trustees decided to sell the building but offered it to Elland UDC. In 1954, a Community Centre was formed by the Trustees. In 1967 it was taken over by Elland UDC. Some maintenance was undertaken but by 1974, when Calderdale MBC became the owners, it needed repairs. In 1977, the council demolished the twin towers at the entrance. Several surveys were carried out but ¬£500,000 was required to bring it up to standard. A committee tried to raise this money but was not successful and the centre closed on 18 December 2009. The building was signed back to the council and declared surplus to requirements. In January 2011, councillors voted to sell the building as the cost to bring the building up to standard is too much. St Helen's Well St Helen's Well at the eastern end of the village is mentioned in John Watson's monumental The History and Antiquities of the Parish of Halifax, 1775. He gives no description but says a Roman Catholic chapel dedicated to Saint Helen, nearby had been converted into a cottage, but in its walls was a large stone known locally as 'the Cross'. Strangers, presumed to be Catholics, made pilgrimages to the well. Watson also possessed a deed which mentioned a grant made to Henry de Sacro Fonte de Staynland. dated between 1279 and 1324. The well was restored in 1843 in response to interest in drinking 'spa' water. The 'Halifax Guardian' for September 1842 described the scene around Well Head spa where crowds carrying drinking utensils jostled each other in their eagerness to take the waters. Well Head was the most popular of the Halifax spas but several other springs in the area were frequented. Similar scenes may have occurred around Stainland‚Äôs well. In the late 19th century the well was declining. The stone trough had cracked and was leaking. Local placenames reflect the importance of the well. The eastern end of the village is known as Holywell Green, there is a public house called 'The Holywell Inn' and a 'St Helen‚Äôs Court'. The well was further restored in 1977 and the crumbling trough of the woodcut has been replaced by a solid modern one, no water flows into it. Carr Hall Castle Carr Hall Castle Carr Hall Castle, located on the edge of Thunnerley Wood in the Holywell Brook valley, was built in the mid- nineteenth century by the Shaw family, local mill owners, to improve the view from their mansion at Shaw Park. It provided a stable block and housing for the bailiff who bred the shire horses for Brookroyd Mills. The building has been restored and modernised since 2002. In 2008 the castle won Channel Five's TV show I Own Britain's Best Home. Religion St Andrew's Church, Stainland St Andrew's C of E Church in the centre of the village was built c.1755 as a chapel for Stainland, Holywell Green and Sowood. The church tower is visible from Norland and Blackley. Stainland had three other chapels, Stainland Providence Chapel, Stainland Wesleyan Chapel and a mortuary chapel. The mortuary chapel was next to a graveyard that served the Providence Chapel. All three graveyards remain but only the Providence Chapel remains and was converted into nine houses. The mortuary chapel was demolished after the Providence Chapel became houses. The Wesleyan Chapel was demolished to make way for houses. Community Public houses and restaurants Stainland public houses and restaurants include '1885 The Restaurant', awarded Yorkshire Life Neighbourhood Restaurant of the Year 2005-06, Highlife Magazine Fine Dining Restaurant of West Yorkshire 2003-04 and nominated for Yorkshire Life Newcomer Restaurant of the Year 2003-04\\\\. Other pubs include The Duke of York, The Red Lion and The Rose and Crown. The Bull and Dog (also known as The Stone Ridge) closed in 2008. The Black Horse Inn was demolished and replaced by a garage and more recently housing. Sport Stainland Bowling Green, with the pavilion. The cricket ground is beyond the pavilion Stainland has five sports clubs; Stainland United FC, Stainland Stags ARLFC, Stainland CC, Stainland Lions Running Club and Stainland Bowling Club. All are based at Stainland Recreation Ground except for Stainland Lions who are based at Heath RUFC, Greetland. Stainland Recreation Ground (Stainland Rec or the Rec) lies west of the village centre and has two football pitches, a rugby pitch, a cricket ground, a bowling green, a tennis court, a five-a-side pitch, and a playground. Stainland United FC play in the Halifax and District League First Division. The club was formed in 1947 as Stainland Athletic and changed its name to Stainland United in 1980. In 1992 the club folded but reformed in 1997 and won the Halifax Premier Division in the 2006-07 season. Stainland Stags ARLFC play in the Pennine League First Division and coached by ex super league player Danny Fearon. Stainland Cricket Club and Stainland Bowling Club share a pavilion at Stainland Recreational Ground. The pavilion was built in 2001 after the previous pavilion burnt down. The ground is called the Memorial Ground after it was given as a post-war gift in 1922. It is one of the biggest in the Halifax League. They played at Drury Lane for 40 years. Stainland CC play in the Towergate Halifax Cricket League Second Division. Stainland won the Second Division title in 1979 and 2002. Education Bowling Green Primary School Bowling Green Primary School is on Bowling Green Road and is under the local authority of Calderdale Council. The first school on the site was built by the local overseer of the poor in 1805. The present school building, built on the former bowling green and designed by John Leeming (1849‚Äì1931) of Halifax, was opened by the Board of Education on 24 February 1882, its two foundation stones being dated 1 October 1881. The foundation stones were laid by John Mellor and Thomas Carter, the chairman and vice chairman of the School Board. Local ratepayers funded their silver trowels for the ceremony. Joseph Stott, a Board member, gave a speech saying that \\"he believed there was a necessity for additional means of instruction,\\" before hundreds of people were given tea in the local Sunday school room.

The diptychs were generally in ivory, wood or metal and decorated with rich relief sculpture. A consular diptych was commissioned by a consul ordinarius to mark his entry to that post, and was distributed as a commemorative reward to those who had supported his candidature or might support him in future.p178. The origin, context, and function of consular diptychs. Alan Cameron, in memory of Tally Kampen. Journal of Roman Studies 103 (2013) pp. 174‚Äì207. History Origins Magnus, who was consul of Constantinople in 518. He sits between figures representing Rome and Constantinople. Louvre From as early as the first century CE, some formal letters of appointment to office were known as \\"codicilli\\", little books, two or more flat pieces of (usually) wood, joined by clasps, lined with wax on which was written the letter of appointment. Later, the letter might be written on papyrus and presented within the covers. By the late fourth century, however, specially-commissioned diptychs began to be included among the gifts that appointees to high office distributed to celebrate and publicize the public games that were their principal duties.p. 182. The origin, context, and function of consular diptychs. Alan Cameron, in memory of Tally Kampen. Journal of Roman Studies 103 (2013) pp. 174‚Äì207. These diptychs were made of ivory, with relief carvings on the outside chosen by the donor, looking superficially similar to codicils but containing no writing and with no official status.pp. 185‚Äì194. The origin, context, and function of consular diptychs. Alan Cameron, in memory of Tally Kampen. Journal of Roman Studies 103 (2013) pp. 174‚Äì207. The routine distribution of such diptychs in the East is marked by a decision by Theodosius I in 384 to limit expenditure on the games of Constantinople by reserving ivory diptychs (and golden gifts) to consuls alone.Cod. Theod. 15.9.1, p. 181 of The origin, context, and function of consular diptychs. Alan Cameron, in memory of Tally Kampen. Journal of Roman Studies 103 (2013) pp. 174‚Äì207. In the western empire, they became a usual part of the public displays given by great aristocrats. Quintus Aurelius Symmachus, for example, distributed some to commemorate his son's quaestorian games in 393 and praetorian games in 401 respectively. Almost all depict the games, and on three separate occasions Symmachus links the presentation of these diptychs with the completion of the games.p. 182 of: The origin, context, and function of consular diptychs. Alan Cameron, in memory of Tally Kampen. Journal of Roman Studies 103 (2013) pp. 174‚Äì207. Their end is marked by the consulship's disappearance under the reign of Justinian in 541. The oldest diptych that can properly be called a consular diptych, held in the cathedral treasury at Aosta, is one commissioned by Anicius Petronius Probus, consul in the Western Empire in 406 ‚Äì it is unique not only for its extreme antiquity but also as the only one to bear the portrait of the Emperor (Honorius in this instance, to whom the diptych is dedicated in an inscription full of humility, with Probus calling himself the emperor's \\"famulus\\" or slave) rather than that of the consul. Later, consular diptychs systematically carried either a more or less elaborate portrait of the consul on the most richly decorated examples or a dedicatory inscription to him within a geometric and vegetal scheme on the simpler examples. The simpler examples were probably produced as a series from models prepared in advance, with the more sophisticated (and thus more expensive) diptychs reserved for the inner circle of the Roman aristocracy. The workshops responsible for their production were to be found in the Empire's two capitals at Rome and Constantinople, but the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 was probably responsible for the disappearance of western production at the end of the 5th century, with all surviving consular diptychs from the 6th century originating from Constantinople. The most common motif on 6th century consular diptychs from Constantinople shows the consul, standing, presiding over the consular games which marked his entry to the consulship. By their very nature, consular diptychs are a valuable tool for the prosopography of the late Roman Empire as well as for the study of the art of this period. Large numbers of them have survived to the present day, in many cases due to their re-use as book covers for medieval ecclesiastical manuscripts. Some were also used in churches as grand bindings for lists of bishops and similar records.Medieval Italy, an Encyclopedia, p. 566, Christopher Kleinhenz ed. Routledge, 2004, , The Barberini Ivory is a much rarer Imperial diptych, probably of Justinian.

The season has no official bounds but cyclones tend to form between April and December. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northern Indian Ocean. There are two main seas in the North Indian Ocean‚Äîthe Bay of Bengal to the east of the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian Sea to the west of India. The official Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in this basin is the India Meteorological Department (IMD), while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) releases unofficial advisories. An average of five tropical cyclones form in the North Indian Ocean every season with peaks in May and November. Cyclones occurring between the meridians 45¬∞E and 100¬∞E are included in the season by the IMD. Systems Tropical Storm One (1A) A tropical depression that formed on June 8 off the western coast of India tracked westward, becoming a tropical storm on the 9th. It looped to the north, where upper level winds ripped it apart on the 12th. Tropical Storm Two (2B) A tropical disturbance in the eastern Bay of Bengal developed into a tropical depression on October 17. It moved northwestward, briefly becoming a tropical storm before upper level winds weakened it. The storm hit Bangladesh as a tropical depression on the 19th, but still managed to cause strong storm surge and flooding amounting to 1500 casualties. Tropical Storm Three (3B) Tropical Storm Three, which formed in the southern Bay of Bengal on November 14, tracked northward to reach a peak of 65 mph winds before hitting Myanmar on the 18th. The storm rapidly dissipated over land. Cyclone Four (4B) The monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression just west of the Malay Peninsula on November 21. Its large circulation caused mudslides and flooding over western Indonesia before consolidating into a tropical storm on the 24th over the central Bay of Bengal. The storm turned northward, where conditions allowed for continued development. The storm became a cyclone on the 26th, and it continued to strengthen as it moved northward. Cyclone Four reached a peak of 130 mph just before hitting the Sundarbans part of Bangladesh. Heavy storm surge and torrential flooding killed 2000 people (with 6000 missing), and left millions homeless. Tropical Storm Five (5B) From December 6 through the 8th, a tropical storm meandered through the central Bay of Bengal, remaining at sea through its lifetime.

They provide accessible information and analysis, and mobilize popular support for campaigns to achieve this mission.  Predecessor organizations  Africa Action is the name the organization adopted in 2001, after three organizations, the American Committee on Africa, the Africa Fund, and the Africa Policy Information Center, merged. The American Committee on Africa (ACOA) was founded in New York City in 1953 by George Houser and other activists. It was created by a group of black and white civil rights activists led by Bayard Rustin under name Committee to Support South African Resistance, who had organized support for the historic Defiance Campaign in South Africa the previous year. In the book, No Easy Victories, ACOA is described as the ‚Äúpremier U.S. Africa solidarity organization‚Äù. It became this way through ‚Äúcoalition building‚Ä¶ work with the young United Nations and by cultivating good relationships with emerging African leaders.‚Äù No Easy Victories eds. William Minter, Gail Hovey and Charles Cobb (2007) New York was a center of activity for ACOA through the 1980s in organizing anti-apartheid activities. The Africa Fund, founded in 1966, worked with ACOA to provide key support for independence movements throughout Africa. During the anti-apartheid movement, the Africa Fund became the \\"principal contact point for progressive trade unionists and politicians.\\" They encouraged US firms and stockholders to divest in South Africa and published updated lists of U.S. companies involved there. The Africa Policy Information Center (APIC) was founded in Washington, DC in 1978. It produced research, analysis and education materials designed to widen the debate in the United States around African issues and the U.S. role in Africa. Current programs According to their website, Africa Action is a national organization for political, economic and social justice in Africa. Africa Action contends that the U.S. has a special historic responsibility toward Africa. It also believes that racism has been and is a major determinant of U.S. policies toward Africa, Africans and U.S. citizens of African descent. Members of the organization value Africa and its peoples, and seek to work in partnership with Africans. Today, together with activists and civil society organizations throughout the United States and in Africa, Africa Action works to change U.S. foreign policy and the policies of international institutions to support African struggles for peace and development.Africa Action's About Us Page Peace and Justice in Darfur and all Sudan Just L.E.A.D. In 2008 Africa Action launched a new, intensified campaign to raise awareness about the continuing crisis in Darfur and put public pressure on the next U.S. president to lead the international community in bringing peace and justice to Darfur and all Sudan. In June 2008, both Barack Obama and John McCain signed a pledge promising \\"unstinting resolve\\" to end genocide in Darfur. Today Africa Action is mobilizing public pressure to keep this promise by achieving: #Protection of civilians from violence, starvation and disease; #Sustainable peace for all Sudan, including upholding the Comprehensive Peace Agreement; and #Justice for victims and accountability for perpetrators. The campaign under the banner JUST L.E.A.D not only calls for leadership from the U.S. government but also challenges all people to meet our collective responsibility as ordinary individuals to LEARN. EDUCATE. and ACT. DAILY. on the most important moral and solidarity question of our time. As part of this campaign Africa Action is working with other organizations to collect one million postcards urging President Obama to make peace and justice in Darfur and all Sudan a Day-One priority. Campaign to End HIV/AIDS in Africa Africa Action‚Äôs Campaign to End HIV/AIDS in Africa mobilizes U.S. activists to change the policies of our own government to help end the HIV/AIDS crisis in Africa. According to Africa Action, the HIV/AIDS pandemic is the greatest global threat in the world today. Africa is ground zero of the crisis ‚Äì home to nearly two-thirds of those living with HIV/AIDS worldwide. Africa‚Äôs HIV/AIDS crisis is the direct result of centuries of global injustice. Now, African efforts to defeat HIV/AIDS are hindered by insufficient resources and by U.S. and international policies that restrict access to essential treatment and comprehensive health care. Campaign to Cancel Africa's Debt Africa Action‚Äôs Campaign to Cancel Africa‚Äôs Debt mobilizes pressure on the U.S. government to push for 100% debt cancellation for all impoverished African countries without harmful conditions. According to Africa Action, Africa's over $200 billion debt burden is the single biggest obstacle to the continent's development. Most of this debt is illegitimate, having been incurred by despotic and unrepresentative regimes. African countries spend almost $14 billion annually on debt service, diverting resources from HIV/AIDS programs, education and other important needs. The U.S. and other rich countries have resisted calls to cancel this debt, instead proposing partial solutions that are inadequate and impose harsh economic policies on indebted countries. Key countries Africa Action believes that it is in the U.S.‚Äô interest that, within each African region, countries and peoples should be able to advance the common goals of achieving security, democracy and development. While the paths to these objectives may differ, they are inseparable. Economic progress cannot be isolated from the needs for security and expansion of democratic rights. Rational strategies to pursue these goals cannot be designed purely in terms of bilateral relations with selected countries. At the same time, it is not feasible to give equal weight to U.S. relations with each African country. Africa Action singles out five African nations as \\"focus countries\\" where the U.S. must be consistently involved: South Africa, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Algeria. Each \\"focus country\\" meets most or all of the following criteria: (1) they are large countries with large populations (usually the largest in the sub- region); (2) they boast the strongest and most industrialized economies in their respective regions; (3) they are presently among the largest trading partners for the U.S. in Africa (and the largest in their sub-region); (4) the U.S. has diverse and longstanding interests in them (economic, political, social and security); and (5) they are potential economic and political powerhouses of their respective regions. These countries are all key actors within their respective regions, whose cooperation will be invaluable to resolving a wide range of problems. They are likely to be either forces for regional security or sources of regional instability. Finally, there are domestic constituencies in the U.S. concerned with policy toward each of these countries that can help build and sustain public support for new U.S. initiatives. Giving priority to these countries should not be confused with making unconditional alliances with their ruling elites, with seeking to build them up as regional hegemonic powers, or with granting them automatic first- call with regard to economic assistance. Rather, U.S. policy towards each of these key countries must encompass the realities of each region they are a part of, and encourage constructive dialogue and collective problem solving among neighbors. Americans must also recognize that the U.S. has special historical responsibilities toward a select number of other countries‚ÄîLiberia, Angola, Somalia, and Sudan‚Äîthat warrant particular attention. The policy approaches to these countries will also be most effective if integrated into policies toward their respective regions. Sustained attention to \\"focus countries\\" should always be placed within the respective regional context. Thus, there should be a Southern Africa policy while acknowledging that South Africa is a priority within the region, and a West African policy that recognizes Nigeria's centrality to U.S. concerns in that region. What happens in the DRC, will have profound effects on the prospects for its neighbors. Although their regional weight is less overwhelming, Kenya and Algeria will also have major impacts on their respective regions.

Between 1979 and 1993 she worked at IBM, that year she joined Telecom Argentina, where which she would become president. Aside from her native Spanish, she also speaks, with varying levels of fluency, English, Portuguese and French.  Career  Malcorra with US Secretary of State, John Kerry, in Washington, D.C., March 2016 Malcorra served as the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Field Support. She was appointed by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in March 2008, succeeding Jane Holl Lute. Prior to that, she had been chief operating officer and Deputy Executive Director of the World Food Programme, where she oversaw emergency and humanitarian operations in more than 80 countries. During the tsunami emergency in December 2004, she led the first phase of the operational response and mustered human resources, budget, finance, information, technology, telecommunications, administration and security to deal with the disaster. Malcorra and the United States President Barack Obama in Buenos Aires Cathedral, March 2016 She had more than 25 years of experience in the private sector before joining the WFP. She started her career at IBM Argentina in 1979. During her fourteen years in the company, she held several different positions, the last one being Branch Manager for Public Sector and Services. She was assigned to the headquarters in 1986 as part of the Management Development Programme. She left IBM Argentina in January 1993 to join Telecom Argentina. During her tenure at Telecom Argentina she again held various responsibilities, from Regional Manager and Head of the Mass Market Unit to chief operating officer. In 2001 she was appointed CEO of the company. In November 2015, Argentine President-Elect Macri announced her as future foreign minister. Since her first day in charge, she has been changing Argentina's foreign policy, making a distance from Bolivarian axes, and returning to a very close relationship with the United States and the European countries. Minister of Foreign Relations As Minister of Foreign Relations, and with the support of President Mauricio Macri, she revitalized bilateral relations with the United States and Europe, reviewed the fundamentals of Mercosur, evaluated alternatives that involve more free trade and the country returned to a single exchange rate, which It allowed the reactivation of commodity exports and attracted foreign direct investment. United Nations Secretary- General selection British foreign secretary Philip Hammond, in London, 2016 Minister Malcorra was a candidate to replace Ban Ki-moon as secretary general of the UN starting in January 2017. She has been asked several questions about accountability for harms caused by UN Peacekeeper troops. On 8 June, in response to a question by the Ambassador of Lichtenstein regarding accountability for the cholera outbreak in Haiti started by a deployment of UN Peacekeepers, Malcorra replied, \\"It is now in legal process, I'm not privy to it so it's hard for me to fully answer the question without getting into an arena that I'm not fully in. It's clear the UN is invested a lot to build up the infrastructure of Haiti based on the cholera experience/chain reaction so that is something that the UN needs to do more. The trust established was not fully filled so there is an element of working with the Haitians to handle cholera. On the specifics, I'd rather wait to be better informed.\\" Most of the candidates for secretary general, all of whom have less extensive UN experience have taken a position in favor of stronger UN accountability, including compensation to the victims. In terms of UN accountability for sexual assault and exploitation by UN troops, she stated, \\"\\"The Organization's efforts to prevent sexual exploitation and abuse in all manifestations and, where it does occur, to support victims and hold accountable those responsible, requires our utmost priority in order to fulfill the obligations incumbent upon us. This must be done with the political will that can only be derived from a full partnership with Member States.\\" Responding the U.S. on the same subject, she emphasized, \\"I think we have to go beyond what we have today and that's why I've proposed this question of the code of conduct.\\" Other activities * International Crisis Group (ICG), Board of Trustees (since 2019)Crisis Group Welcomes Four New Trustees to Board International Crisis Group (ICG), press release of January 21, 2019. * IE Business School, Transatlantic Relations Initiative Distinguished FellowTransatlantic Relations Initiative: About Us IE Business School. * Inter-American Dialogue, Member of the Board of DirectorsBoard of Directors Inter-American Dialogue. * World Economic Forum (WEF), Member of the Global Future Council on Geopolitics (2018-2019)Global Future Council on Geopolitics World Economic Forum (WEF).

Although he is perhaps most frequently associated with Winger, Taylor has also played with numerous other prominent musicians, including future Sammy Hagar and Boston guitarist Gary Pihl (in his early days), Eric Martin (solo artist and future Mr. Big frontman), Aldo Nova, Steve Perry of Journey, Alice Cooper and Tommy Shaw. In the late 70's Paul briefly played in a Northern California band called Stark Raving Mad (Paul on lead guitar, Piano and Vocals, with Donovan Stark, Gary Pihl (later of with Sammy Hagar and Boston), Jay Causbrook, and David Payne, with Eric Martin (of Mr. Big). Taylor experienced his first mainstream success in the early 1980s as the touring keyboardist in Canadian musician Aldo Nova's backing band, and he appears in the music video for Nova's biggest hit, \\"Fantasy.\\" Prior to forming Winger, Taylor and Kip Winger were both playing with Alice Cooper's backing band on the tours for Cooper's mid-80s albums, Constrictor (1986) and Raise Your Fist and Yell (1987). During this time, the two began composing songs together and, while on break from touring, recorded what would become the first Winger demos. Whereas Kip left Alice's band prior to the European leg of the 1987 tour, Paul remained on board for the European dates. However, in the midst of touring Europe, Paul received a call from Kip, who had been working with future Winger lead guitarist Reb Beach recording more demos in New York, informing him that he had gotten a record deal. After the European tour was finished, Paul flew straight back to New York, and the Winger project (initially known as \\"Sahara\\") began rehearsing and recording their debut album. Taylor remained in Winger throughout the band's most successful period, which included the two smash albums, Winger and In the Heart of the Young. However, after the tour supporting the latter album ended in 1991, Taylor left the band in early 1992, citing exhaustion and a desire to write and get involved with other projects. Throughout the 1990s, Taylor immersed himself in numerous other projects, perhaps the most prolific of which was recording and touring with Steve Perry for his 1994 solo album. In 1998, he returned to the Alice Cooper band (this time, alongside fellow former Winger guitarist Reb Beach), and once that tour ended, he embarked on a brief tour with Tommy Shaw. Winger reunited in 2001 to record new material for a Greatest Hits album. Although it is unclear whether Taylor participated in these recording sessions, he did later join the band on the supporting tour. Though Paul was asked by Kip Winger to rejoin the band again to work on their 2006 reunion album, he declined because he was already involved with other projects. More recently, Taylor has become involved in composing music for television series programs and has also been pursuing his passion for photography. He also spent the summer months of 2012 touring with Cinderella throughout the U.S. playing keyboards for them. He returned to Winger during mid-2013 and performed with them on select tour dates up through early 2014 and appeared in the Queen Babylon released in late 2014.

Known for painting live on stage with musicians during their performances and the public installation of \\"Happy Street Signs\\". Live Music Painting Kilford‚Äôs paintings are physical representations of music based on the colours he sees when he hears music. Kilford's live music paintings are created live alongside musicians during their performances. The creation of the painting starts at the first note of the performance and ends on the last note. Kilford is the first painter to paint live on stage at Knebworth, he has painted live alongside a wide range of musicians including Baaba Maal, Iggy Pop, Paul Weller, I Blame Coco, Buena Vista Social Club, Robert Plant, Damon Albarn, The Black Eyed Peas, Brian Eno, Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, The Magic Numbers, Saint Etienne, Cerys Matthews, Deep Purple, Status Quo and The Charlatans, Ras Kwame, Tom Hodge, I Blame Coco, Akala, Alice Russell, Pendulum, Skunk Anansie, Rotten Hill Gang, Feeder, The Woodentops, Ernest Ranglin, The Vaccines, Jonathan Batiste, Noah Francis and the Wu-Tang Clan amongst others. Kilford curated a monthly live music painting installation called ‚ÄúOne Love‚Äù where people could experience great live music being painted up close and live. The first One Love installation ‚ÄúOne Love #1‚Äù took place 15 February 2010 and continued every 3rd Monday of the month at The Social in London for 13 months. Bands that played at One Love to date include Siskin, The Speak and Spells, John & Jehn, Angrydan!, Pope Joan, The Woodentops, Dan Clews, Tallulah Rendell, Stairs To Korea, Kurtz, Eliza Newman, Fran & Josh, Akala, Vices, Scarlette Fever, Laurel Collective, Claire Nicolson, Rachael Sage, Swami, King Charles, Gwenno, Left Step Band, Zarif, Alexander Wolfe, Charlene Soraia and Missing Andy. Happy Street Signs Kilford moved to New York City in 2013 and was inspired by the street signs. Kilford began creating large paintings of street signs but modified them to project positive messages, the paintings were then used to design and manufacture Happy Street Signs to government specification. On Tuesday 12 November 2013 Kilford curated an installation of 200 Happy Street Signs in Lower Manhattan and Williamsburg. 60 volunteers were involved with the installation which included surveying pedestrians in order to document the reaction from the public. Kilford believes that positive reinforcement via Happy Street Signs enables enhanced government communication which will contribute to a subtle, measurable increase in happiness. \\"If you see sign that says something different or unexpected, for example ‚Äòhonk less, love more,‚Äô that will trigger a reaction, ideally a smile. If we can make people smile, then holistically, over time, that will start to increase‚Ä¶their level of happiness.‚Äù Each Happy Street Sign displays \\"Dept of Well Being\\" at the bottom which is a fictitious government department. Kilford says \\" the City (New York City) needs a department designed to make us happier\\" and the results of the survey will provide statistics to prove it. Kilford has previously worked with the Office for National Statistics (British Government) who are responsible for the Measuring National Well Being Programme, a programme that measures well being in the United Kingdom. Early work Although Kilford‚Äôs early work was created within the context of music, it had a strong focus on fusing fashion and art. For Kilford‚Äôs first public installation he installed a catwalk in the Burj Al Arab Hotel in Dubai and showed 30 paintings using models to carry each painting down the catwalk. Following this, Kilford‚Äôs donated painting sold at Elton John's White Tie and Tiara Ball in Cape Town. It was at this point that EJAF inspired the collaboration between Kilford and South African fashion designer Gavin Rajah. The pair worked on a number of projects, the most significant being the creation of an annual South African charitable event called Positive. Positive was conceptualized by Kilford and Rajah with a view to bringing art, music and fashion together as one to help combat AIDS. Sponsored by Sun International Hotels the event helps fund The Tapologo Aids Hospice which was founded by Bishop Kevin Dowling of the Catholic Diocese of Rustenburg. The first Positive event took place 8 to 11 June 2006 at Sun City and incorporated fashion shows by Versace, Roberto Cavalli, Valentino as well as a headlining performance from SEAL. Kilford curated two exhibitions, during the event, the main exhibition called ‚ÄúHope Healing and Compassion‚Äù including over 110 South African artists. The second exhibition was the ‚ÄòWall of Hope‚Äô, this included a number of small paintings created by a wide range of leading bands, celebrities and children from the Tapologo AIDS Hospice on the subject of ‚ÄúHope‚Äù. Kilford is no longer involved with Positive.

History  The Kwango River flows into the Kassai River, which itself is a tributary of the River Congo. This mission (Missio Kwangensis) formed a part of the Apostolic Vicariate of Belgian Congo till April, 1892, when a papal decree was issued, entrusting this new mission to the Jesuit Fathers of the order's Belgian province. Emile van Hencxthoven (1852‚Äì1906) was its first superior. He left Belgium on 6 March 1893 with two priests, one scholastic, and two lay brothers, and reached the mission towards the end of May. One of the priests died on the way. By decree of 30 January 1903, the Kwango mission was made a prefecture Apostolic (Pr√¶fectura Apostolica Kwangensis), the first prefect Apostolic being Father Julian Banckaert, with residence at Kisantu, the chief mission station. The prefecture comprised the civil districts of Eastern Kwango and that of Stanley Pool as far to the north as the River Kassai. It was located between 4¬∞ to 8¬∞ S. latitude and 15¬∞ to 20¬∞ E. longitude. Its boundaries were to the north the river Kassai, to the east the range of hills between the Rivers Loange and D'Juma; to the south Portuguese territory; to the west the River Inkisi and the railway to Leopoldville. The sisters of Notre Dame de Namur had educational institutions for girls at Kisantu and Lemfu. Jesuit father Julian Banckaert was born at Bruges (Belgium) in 1847, entered the diocesan seminary, and was ordained in 1871. He joined the Society of Jesus in 1875 and was sent to Bengal in 1878. There he was successively a missionary, superior of the mission, and military chaplain until, in 1901, he was sent to the Kwango mission. In 1931 it became the Apostolic Vicariate of Kisantu, and later, in 1959, the diocese of Kisantu.

It is clinically similar to a pericardial effusion, and, depending on the volume and rapidity with which it develops, may cause cardiac tamponade. The condition can be caused by full-thickness necrosis (death) of the myocardium (heart muscle) after myocardial infarction, chest trauma, and by over-prescription of anticoagulants. Other causes include ruptured aneurysm of sinus of Valsalva and other aneurysms of the aortic arch.Gray's Anatomy, 1902 ed. Hemopericardium can be diagnosed with a chest X-ray or a chest ultrasound, and is most commonly treated with pericardiocentesis. While hemopericardium itself is not deadly, it can lead to cardiac tamponade, a condition that is fatal if left untreated. Symptoms and signs Symptoms of hemopericardium often include difficulty breathing, abnormally rapid breathing, and fatigue, each of which can be a sign of a serious medical condition not limited to hemopericardium. In many cases, patients also report feeling chest pressure and have an abnormally elevated heart rate. Cause  Hemopericardium has been reported to result from various afflictions including chest trauma, free wall rupture after a myocardial infarction, bleeding into the pericardial sac following a type A aortic dissection, and as a complication of invasive cardiac procedures. Acute leukemia has also been reported as a cause of the condition. Several cases of hemopericardium have also been reported as a side- effect of anticoagulants. Patients should be made aware of this fact when prescribed these drugs. Mechanism Hemopericardium is a condition that affects the cardiovascular system. It typically begins with blood accumulating in the pericardial sac posterior to the heart, and eventually expands to surround the entire heart. The fluid build-up then causes pressure within the pericardial sac to increase. If the pressure becomes greater than the intracardiac pressure of the heart, compression of the adjacent cardiac chambers can occur. This compression, called cardiac tamponade, is often associated with hemopericardium and can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated promptly. Early signs of this compression include right atrial inversion during ventricular systole followed by diastolic compression of the right ventricular outflow tract. There have also been cases reported in which hemopericardium was noted as an initial manifestation of essential thrombocythemia. Diagnosis Hemopericardium can be diagnosed using echocardiography, a cardiac ultrasound. Chest X-rays are also often taken when hemopericardium is suspected and would reveal an enlarged heart. Other observable signs include rapid heart rate, jugular venous distension, low blood pressure, and pulsus paradoxus. Treatment  When discovered, hemopericardium is usually treated by pericardiocentesis, a procedure wherein a needle is used to remove the fluid from the pericardial sac. This procedure typically utilizes an 8-cm, 18-gauge needle that is inserted between the xiphoid process and the left costal margin until it enters the pericardial sac, when it can then be used to drain the fluid from the sac. A catheter is often left in the pericardium to continue draining any remaining fluid after the initial procedure. The catheter can be removed when the hemopericardium no longer persists. The underlying causes of the condition, such as over- prescription of anticoagulants, must be addressed as well so that the hemopericardium does not return. While hemopericardium itself is not fatal, it may lead to cardiac tamponade, which can be deadly if not treated promptly. One study found that cardiac tamponade was fatal in 13.3% of cases in which it was not caused by a malignant disease. Research Studies have shown that hemopericardium can occur spontaneously in people with essential thrombocythaemia, although this is relatively rare. It is a more common occurrence in patients who have been over-prescribed anticoagulants. Regardless of the underlying cause of the hemopericardium, pericardiocentesis has shown to be the best treatment method for the condition.

Service in the Trust Territory of the Pacific Commissioned at Guam, Errol throughout her naval service carried passengers and cargo among American islands and those of the Trust Territory of the Pacific, calling at Guam, Saipan, Tinian, Truk, the Palau Islands, Ulithi, Chichi Jima, Kwajalein, Pagan Island, Agrihan, and smaller islands in the Caroline Islands. From September to December 1949 she was overhauled at Pearl Harbor, the only interruption to her constant operations in the Pacific. Transfer to Department of the Interior  She was decommissioned 31 July 1951, and lent to the U.S. Department of the Interior for similar duty the same day. On 29 January 1952 her transfer to the Department of the Interior was made permanent. Her subsequent fate is not known.

The group includes Drew, bassist Taylor MacFee, and drummer Hayden Kaiser. Never Shout Never has released six full-length albums and nine EPs. The touring band that accompanied Drew when NSN was a solo project were known as \\"The Shout\\" until the decision to incorporate the members into the Never Shout Never name full time. History 2007‚Äì08: Formation and early career Christofer Drew Ingle began making music under the alias nevershoutnever! in 2007 (age 16). His first exposure came through the internet, where he achieved success on Myspace before issuing the extended play, The Yippee EP on July 29, 2008. On July 30, 2008, he was featured on TRL, where he performed his single \\"Bigcitydreams\\". He toured with Hellogoodbye and Ace Enders in the fall of 2008. As of November 17, 2008, the official spelling of Ingle's alias became NeverShoutNever!. The spelling was updated on iTunes and his management company's site. NeverShoutNever! started touring with The Scene Aesthetic, The Honorary Title, and The Bigger Lights in late February 2009 and then toured with bands such as Forever the Sickest Kids, The Cab, We the Kings, and Mercy Mercedes, among others in spring 2009 as part of The Bamboozle Roadshow 2009. He played at both The Bamboozle Left 2009 and The Bamboozle 2009. 2009‚Äì10: Warner Bros. signing and What Is Love Christofer Drew performing with Never Shout Never in 2009 It was announced on May 29, 2009, that Ingle had signed to Warner Bros. Records, ending a major-label bidding war. As part of the deal, Ingle runs and make releases on his own imprint label, Loveway Records. Ingle's alias became officially stylized as Never Shout Never. The Summer was Ingle's first release under Warner Bros. and was released on June 23, 2009. The first single from the EP, titled \\"Happy\\", was released on iTunes on March 3, 2009. A self-titled EP, Never Shout Never was released in December 2009 and featured two songs from his upcoming debut album (\\"What Is Love?\\" and \\"Jane Doe\\"), a re-recorded version of a song from The Yippee EP (\\"She's Got Style\\"), and a live version of a song from The Yippee EP (\\"Big City Dreams\\"). The debut album from Never Shout Never, What Is Love?, was produced by Butch Walker and released in January 2010. Never Shout Never performed on the Vans Warped Tour 2010, which toured the United States. 2010‚Äì11: Harmony and Time Travel Christofer Drew performing with Never Shout Never in 2011 Never Shout Never headlined its first Warped Tour in Summer of 2010. Never Shout Never's second full-length album, Harmony, was released in August 2010. In October and November 2010, Never Shout Never co-headlined the Harmony Tour, where the bands had fans gather can foods to help those in need. As a gift to the fans, Never Shout Never and The Maine released a live split EP. The split EP was made available for free download on Never Shout Never's website. The band's hometown, Joplin, Missouri, was heavily damaged by a tornado on May 22, 2011. Following the destruction, Ingle began a relief fund with United Way to raise $1.2 million for his hometown. To raise awareness about the devastation of Joplin, Ingle took video footage of the destruction and posted it on YouTube on June 1, 2011. The video, which features the song \\"Time Travel\\", encouraged viewers to donate to the relief of the town via his United Way fund. The official music video for \\"Time Travel\\" was directed by Joey Boukadakis. Never Shout Never's third album, Time Travel was released on September 20, 2011. 2012: Indigo Ingle first revealed the title of the group's fourth studio album in an interview with Alter The Press! on May 8, 2012, and on September 20, via his Twitter account, he announced the release date of his new album Indigo. Never Shout Never's fourth full-length album, Indigo was released November 13, 2012. It debuted at 194 on the Billboard 200, a steep decline from the group's previous high of 14. The band toured the U.S. on the Indigo tour in late 2012. 2013: Sunflower and The Xmas EP During 2013, Never Shout Never went back onto the Warped Tour lineup after a three-year break. During the Warped Tour, Ingle had also teamed with BandHappy, an organization in which experienced musicians taught amateurs how to reach success. He had led a workshop in which a limited number of fans could ask questions and learn from him, with the addition of a one-on-one meet and greet. Never Shout Never released its fifth album, Sunflower, on July 2, 2013. A festive EP titled The Xmas EP was released on November 25, 2013. 2014-2017: Recycled Youth, Black Cat, and Departure of MacFee In late 2013, Never Shout Never announced that the group was working on a new album called Recycled Youth, Vol. 1. The album will feature re-worked songs from previous Never Shout Never releases. In January 2014 the band announced that the group had begun recording the album, and was expected to be released later that year. Ian Crawford was revealed to have joined the band in early 2014 as lead guitarist. Recycled Youth, Vol. 1 was released on March 3, 2015. The first song off of Never Shout Never's sixth full-length album, titled \\"Hey! We OK\\", was released on June 9, 2015. Pre- orders for the album were released on iTunes on the band's official store the same day, including a limited deluxe bundle, where the first 100 orders received one of the items signed. The song \\"Boom!\\" was released on the Vans Warped Tour 2015 Compilation CD. The album was released on August 7, 2015. On November 24, 2015, Ian Crawford confirmed on his Facebook page that he had been let go from the band. On June 26, 2016, bassist Taylor MacFee announced his departure from the band.  2017-2018: \\"Throwback Tour\\" and break-up  Never Shout Never performed during the 2017 Warped Tour before going on the Throwback Tour. The tour lasted throughout 2017 where they played songs from earlier albums that likely wouldn't be played again for a long time. On March 23, 2018, the band released a cover of Elvis Presley's \\"Love Me Tender\\" on their upcoming cover album \\"All for Love\\" composed entirely of covers of love songs. On April 2, they released their cover of the Beatles' \\"Something\\". Ingle revealed in December 2018 that after a small tour in Mexico and Brazil the following month that Never Shout Never would disband. However, he reached out to fans via an Instagram post two days later asking if he should keep making music under the name. Following the final show in Brazil (with long- time drummer Hayden Kaiser absent) he stated he was uncertain of the band's future, but no official breakup announcement has yet been confirmed. It is unlikely All for Love was finished and would be released. Drew continued to upload a couple of covers on YouTube, but these were likely not final recordings for the album, nor were they probably intended to be on the album at all.  2020-present: \\"Unborn Spark\\" and Potential Return  On April 29, 2020, Drew tweeted a video announcing a solo acoustic album titled Unborn Spark, due for release on May 13, his son's 1st birthday. However, on May 5, he announced that he needed a little more time for mixing and artwork to be completed. On May 17, he announced that the album would be released on June 12. On June 8, the first single, \\"Time to Change\\", was released. With it came the announcement that it would be released as a Never Shout Never album, per the official Never Shout Never Twitter account's first tweet since May 2017.

The Toronto school gradually expanded, and in 1991 she and Cohen decided to open a second school in Brooklyn, New York and wind down the Toronto school. However, by 1994 the New York school had folded, and the marriage of Arrowsmith Young and Cohen had ended.

Background: Suitable students. Retrieved 6 June 2015. History and methodology The program was founded by Barbara Arrowsmith Young while she was a graduate student at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education. As a child she had exceptional visual and auditory memory, but it was coupled with several severe deficits in other areas, including dyslexia, dyscalculia, and problems with spatial reasoning, logic, and kinesthetic perception. In 1977‚Äì1978 she developed a series of remedial exercises which she says helped her to overcome her own disabilities rather than merely compensate for them. According to Arrowsmith Young, she based the program on Mark Rosenzweig's work on neuroplasticity and on the work of Alexander Luria and his theories about the relationship between the neurodynamic processes in different functional systems of the brain. In their 2015 audit of 15 remedial programs for specific learning difficulties for the New Zealand organization SPELD, George Dawson and Stephanie D'Souza gave basic descriptions of the nineteen areas of cognitive processing which the Arrowsmith Program is intended to improve as well as descriptions of some of its remediation exercises. In their introduction Dawson and D'Souza stated that the Arrowsmith Program is licensed on a for-profit payment basis with detailed descriptions of its exercises not publicly available and that their descriptions were based on Arrowsmith Young's own account in The Woman Who Changed Her Brain.Dawson, George and D'Souza, Stephanie (23 March 2015). \\"Behavioural Interventions to Remediate Learning Disorders: A Technical Report\\". Speld.org.nz. The deficit areas for which Dawson and D'Souza were able to provide basic descriptions of the Arrowsmith remedial exercises included: *Motor symbol sequencing The remedial exercise involves tracing using pen and paper while the student's left eye is covered. According to Arrowsmith Young's description of the program, this is intended to stimulate the left hemisphere motor cortex and thus improve tracking while reading and improve the ability to use \\"binocular vision cues\\". *Symbol relations The remedial exercise involves reading analog clocks with multiple hands displayed on a computer. The exercise has fourteen different rules. According to Arrowsmith Young, this exercise targets problems at the juncture of the occipital, parietal, and temporal lobes areas on the left side of the brain which can produce a tendency to reverse the sequence of letters in a word and make it difficult to parse syntax and read an analog clock. *Memory for information or instructions The remedial exercise involves memorizing increasingly more complicated song lyrics by listening to them as many times as it takes to be able to repeat them accurately. According to Arrowsmith Young, this exercise targets the left hemisphere temporal lobe where a deficit manifests itself in an inability to remember accurately conversations, lectures, and instructions. *Symbol recognition The remedial exercise involves remembering increasingly long strings of computer-presented letters from languages with a different orthography from English, e.g., Urdu, Arabic, etc.. According to Arrowsmith Young, this exercise targets deficits located in the occiptital-temporal area which cause difficulty in learning to read and spell. *Artifactual thinking The remedial exercise involves looking a narrative picture and then forming a reasonable hypothesis of what story is being depicted. According to Arrowsmith Young, this exercise targets a deficit located in the right prefrontal cortex which cause difficulty in interpreting the emotions of others. In their report, Dawson and D'Souza describe the remediation exercises for nine out of the nineteen areas as \\"vague\\", \\"not clear\\" or unspecified in Arrowsmith Young's book. These include: *Broca's speech pronunciation According to Arrowsmith Young, this deficit located Broca's area of the brain, causes mispronunciation, restricted vocabulary, and difficulty in simultaneously speaking and thinking. *Auditory speech discrimination According to Arrowsmith Young, this deficit involving the superior temporal lobe, reduces the capacity to distinguish words that rhyme, e.g., fear and hear. *Symbolic thinking According to Arrowsmith Young, this deficit involving the prefrontal cortex causes a short attention span and reduces capacity for \\"mental initiative\\". *Kinaesthetic perception According to Arrowsmith Young, this deficit involves the somatosensory area of the parietal lobe which causes clumsiness (a tendency to bump into things) and may adversely affect handwriting. At the conclusion of the audit Dawson and D'Souza noted that evidence for the program's efficacy is documented via testimonials from some of the students and their parents and in several research reports, although none have been published in peer-reviewed academic journals. In the authors' opinion: > The Arrowsmith programme claims to be founded on neuroscience research. This > is true in the sense that Arrowsmith Young continually refers back to > localisation of (dys)function as described by Luria when describing the > development of her cognitive exercises. However, it is not the case that > (present) neuroscience research actually supports the use of Arrowsmith's > particular exercises to remediate learning disabilities. Skepticism, evaluation and criticism Norman Doidge, a Canadian psychiatrist and psychoanalyst devoted one of the chapters in his 2008 book The Brain That Changes Itself to Barbara Arrowsmith Young and the Arrowsmith Program. In it he recounts Arrowsmith Young's own struggle to overcome her learning disabilities and how she developed the program. The chapter also includes several brief case histories of children and adults who Doidge says were significantly helped by the program, although no quantifiable data is presented.Clark, Elaine and Pompa, Janiece L. (2011). \\"Advances in Neuroscience and Reading Disabilities\\". The Oxford Handbook of School Psychology, pp. 183‚Äì184. Oxford University Press. He described her approach as \\"an important discovery\\" and one that had \\"major implications for education\\". However, as Doidge also acknowledged in the chapter, the Arrowsmith Program has been controversial. Widespread doubt and criticism has emerged from several psychologists, neuroscientists and learning experts. This has centered on the lack of scientific evidence used by the program to demonstrate its efficacy and on its underlying rationale which its critics say represents an oversimplification and misapplication of neuroscientific concepts. Coinciding with Barbara Arrowsmith Young's speaking tour of Australia in 2012, the Catholic Education Office in Sydney announced that it would begin a pilot study involving 20 learning disabled students in their last two years of high school who would be offered the Arrowsmith Program for two years beginning in 2013. If it proved successful, the program would be extended to thousands of children in Catholic schools, including those in younger grades. The cost to parents whose children had been selected for the pilot study would be A$8000 for two years, over and above the normal school fees.Han, Esther (15 May 2012). \\"Proof hurdle for 'brain training'\\". Sydney Morning Herald. Retrieved 9 June 2015. Several Australian academics were critical of the move. Dr Emma Burrows, a neuroscientist at the Florey Institute in Melbourne, and cognitive scientists Anne Castles and Max Coltheart at Macquarie University pointed out that the \\"evidence\\" supporting the program's claims of success was anecdotal rather than based on studies using randomized control trials and published in peer-reviewed academic journals.Sydney Morning Herald (11 May 2012). \\"Experts question effectiveness of program\\".

Dr Burrows was further reported to have expressed concern after directly inquiring with Barbara Arrowsmith for evidence and learning that neuroscientists were not involved with the Arrowsmith Program. In Canada, neuroscientist Adele Diamond and cognitive psychologist Linda Siegel‚Äîboth based at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver‚Äîhave expressed concerns similar to those of Castles and Coltheart.Wickelgren, Ingrid (May/June 2013). \\"Calisthenics for a Child's Mind\\" .

Siegel was also the author of a 2003 report to the Vancouver School Board (VSB) on the efficacy of The Arrowsmith program. At the time, VSB was running a three-year trial of the program, funded in part by the Vancouver Foundation. According to Howard Eaton, the owner and Director of the Eaton Arrowsmith schools, Siegel's report had been influential in the VSB's decision to discontinue the pilot program.Eaton, Howard (2013). \\"Siegel's Study: Points For Comment\\".

In one school the children received the Arrowsmith Program. In the other, the children were enrolled in an Extended Learning Assistance Class (ELAC) which focused on reading and writing. Siegel found that the superior performance of the Arrowsmith children on the comprehension and spelling measures was statistically significant.

Cabinet air was filtered and drawn by negative pressure from the room and cabinet systems. The U.S. Army Biological Warfare Laboratories (USBWL) were a suite of research laboratories and pilot plant centers operating at Camp (later Fort) Detrick, Maryland, United States beginning in 1943 under the control of the U.S. Army Chemical Corps Research and Development Command. The USBWL undertook pioneering research and development into biocontainment, decontamination, gaseous sterilization, and agent production and purification for the U.S. offensive biological warfare program.Martin, James W., George W. Christopher and Edward M. Eitzen (2007), \\"History of Biological Weapons: From Poisoned Darts to Intentional Epidemics\\", In: Dembek, Zygmunt F. (2007), Medical Aspects of Biological Warfare, (Series: Textbooks of Military Medicine), Washington, DC: The Borden Institute, pg 5. The Laboratories and their projects were discontinued in 1969. History Origins The USBWL were created after Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson requested the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) in 1941 to review the feasibility of biological warfare (BW). The following year, the NAS reported that BW might be feasible and recommended that steps be taken to reduce U.S. vulnerability to BW attack. Thereafter, the official policy of the United States was first to deter the use of BW against U.S. forces, and secondarily to retaliate if deterrence failed. World War II Throughout the war years, Dr Ira L. Baldwin, professor of bacteriology at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, was scientific director of the Laboratories.\\"A History of Fort Detrick, Maryland\\", by Norman M. Covert (4th Edition, 2000) Cold War The USBWL were the United States' front-line defense against BW during the first half of the Cold War. Disestablishment In 1969, the USBWL ceased to exist when President Richard Nixon disestablished all offensive BW studies and directed the destruction of all stock piles of BW agents and munitions. Operations At Fort Detrick, the USBWL consisted of various labs and divisions, including: *The Safety \\"S\\" Division, first to be activated (1943) **Biological Protection Branch *The Special Operations (or Projects) Division (1949‚Äì68), the most highly classified work **Conducted hundreds of field tests of aerosolized simulants; **Investigated and developed drugs for use in \\"brainwashing\\" and interrogation *Planning Pilot-Engineering (PP-E) Division *The Crops Division (called \\"Plant Sciences Laboratories\\" after 1966), evaluated thousands of compounds for herbicidal activity (including Agent Orange; see Herbicidal warfare) *The Basic Science [Division?] *Division B, pursued anthrax vaccine work, etc. The USBWL was also a parent facility overseeing testing and production centers elsewhere, including: *Pine Bluff Arsenal, Arkansas *Horn Island, Mississippi *Dugway Proving Ground, Utah, including Granite Peak Installation *Vigo Ordnance Plant, near Terre Haute, Indiana Work-related deaths Three deaths related to occupational bio-agent exposures occurred during the USBWL program. (Additionally, an unnamed lieutenant died in a pump explosion in Building 201 in 1943.) *William Allen Boyles, a 46-year-old microbiologist, contracted anthrax and died on 25 November 1951. Boyles Street, on Fort Detrick, is named in his honor. *Joel Eugene Willard, a 53-year-old electrician, died in 1958 after contracting pulmonary anthrax. Willard Place, on Fort Detrick, is named in his honor. *Albert Nickel, a 53-year-old animal caretaker, died in 1964 after being bitten by an animal infected with Machupo virus. Nickel Place, on Fort Detrick, is named in his honor. The Army made details of these deaths public in 1975.

Its name comes from the historical city of Sandomierz, and in the Middle Ages its eastern edge created a natural border between Lesser Poland and Red Ruthenia. Currently, the once mighty wilderness, which once stretched from Krak√≥w to Lviv, now extends from Tarnobrzeg in the north, to the suburbs of Rzesz√≥w in the south. It is regarded as one of the wildest forested areas of Poland. Among animals living here, one can find various birds, deer, wild pigs, moles, foxes, wolves, snakes, various spiders and insects. The area of the forest is 129,115.6 hectares, and it is made mostly of pines. Currently, large parts of the forest are covered by the Natura 2000 network (Natura 2000 Puszcza Sandomierska PLB180005). Sandomierz Forest has several small rivers, with the largest one being the Leg, a right tributary of the Vistula. The soil is mostly poor quality podzols. The boundary of the forest is marked by four rivers - the Vistula, the San, the Wisloka, and the Wislok. The forest lies within Subcarpathian Voivodeship; its northern part is located in Tarnobrzeg Plain, while in the south it lies in Kolbuszowa Plateau. The first modern settlements were established here between the 10th and 12th centuries. During the Mongol invasion of Poland and other Mongol/Tatar raids of the early Kingdom of Poland, residents of Lesser Poland escaped to the dense forest to save themselves from Asiatic hordes. Sandomierz Forest remained sparsely populated until the mid-14th century, when King Kazimierz Wielki initiated a program of mass settlement, founding several towns. In the 15th and 16th centuries, northern and central areas of the forest were settled by peasants from overpopulated province of Mazovia. In the 17th century, during the Swedish invasion of Poland, local residents again escaped to the forest from Swedish, Cossack, Tatar and Transilvanian invaders. After the Partitions of Poland, the forest became part of Austrian Galicia. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Austrian government invited German-speaking settlers (the so-called Josephine colonization, after Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor). The area turned into a melting pot, where ethnic Poles from Mazovia and Lesser Poland mixed with Germans, Ukrainians, Tatars, Jews, Wallachians and other nationalities. Several local villages were named after different ethnic groups: Rusiny, Moskale, Mazury, Wolochy, Szwedy, Turki, Tatary. In the late 19th century, inhabitants of the wilderness began to call themselves Lasowiacy (or Lesioki).

It was erected as a simple mission in 1901, and detached, as a prefecture Apostolic, from the Vicariate of Belgian Congo, on 20 August 1901. Location The residence of the prefect Apostolic was the mission of St. Joseph de Luluabourg, situated a few miles to the south of the station of the Belgian colony of Luluabourg (now Kananga), in the district of Lualaba-Kassai, the chief town of which was Lusambo, residence of the district commissioner. The prefecture, at the time of its creation, comprised almost all the Lualaba-Kassai district. It was bounded on the north by the Vicariate of Belgian Congo (district of the Equateur); on the east by the same vicariate (territory of the Katanga Company); on the south by Portuguese Congo; on the west by the Lubue River. In 1908 it was enlarged by taking as its boundaries on the east the left bank of the Lualaba River, and on the west the Prefecture Apostolic of Kwango, which was in the charge of the Jesuits. The local languages were those of the Bena Lulua, the Baluba (Tshiluba language), Bena Kanioka, the Batetela, the Bakuba, the Bakete, and the Balunda. Religious orders Just one religious order of men was engaged in evangelization there, the Congregation of the Immaculate Heart of Mary of Scheut (Brussels), and a single religious order of women, the Sisters of Charity of Ghent. Residences After 15 November 1891, when P√®re Cambier arrived alone at Luluabourg to commence the evangelization of these regions, eleven residences were established. In order of their foundation, they were: *(1) St-Joseph de Luluabourg; *(2) M√©rode Salvator (Kala Kafumba); *(3) St-Trudon de Lusambo; *(4) Hemptinne St-B√©noit; *(5) Tielen St-Jacques; *(6) Bena Makima St- Victorien; *(7) St-Antoine de Lusambo; *(8) Lusambo; *(9) Udemba; *(10) Pangu- hopital; *(11) Li√®ge-Sacr√©s-Coeurs at Katanga. Besides these larger residences, tended by at least three priests or two priests and a lay brother, fermes-chapelles (or Christian villages) were established in the prefecture. First leader The first Prefect Apostolic of Upper Kassai was Emeri Cambier, born at Flobecq in the Belgian province of Hainaut, 2 January 1865. He was ordained priest 20 November 1887, arrived in the Congo in 1888, at Luluabourg in 1891, and in 1904 was placed at the head of the newly created prefecture Apostolic. The King of Belgium named him an officer of the Royal Order of the Lion in recognition of his services. He died on 29 September 1943, at Namur.

It was situated in the city centre of Newcastle upon Tyne on Forth Banks, a street to the rear of Newcastle Central station. Put up in a disused factory building in 1890 by the Newcastle and District Electric Lighting Company (DisCo), it is notable as the first power station in the world to use turbo alternators, as well as being one of the first municipal power stations in the United Kingdom. In its seventeen-year operating history, the station used various pieces of generating equipment and so had various generating capacities. It ceased to be used following an expansion of the nearby Close Power Station in 1907. Background The Newcastle and District Electric Lighting Company (DisCo) was established by Sir Charles Algernon Parsons and registered as a company on 14 January 1889. While anticipating the obtainment of the necessary powers from the Board of Trade, which they were granted without opposition in 1891, the company set about acquiring their first site in Newcastle's Forth Banks area, as well as ordering machinery and obtaining a sufficient number of customers to justify commencement. In November 1889, the company purchased buildings from Hawthorn Leslie and Company which had formed part of their Forth Banks works, used by their marine engine department prior to moving to new works at St. Peter's. In January 1890, Forth Banks Power Station was commissioned. In opening the station, DisCo became the first electric company to ever trust completely in steam turbines. This was the first time steam turbine and turbo alternator machinery of any kind had been employed in a power station, and the units DisCo ordered for the station were the largest to have ever been built at that time, as well as the first to have been built for a particular purpose. Design and specification The equipment initially installed in the station was two 75 kilowatt turbo alternators, built by Clarke, Chapman, Parsons and Company of Gateshead. These were provided with steam by three Lancashire boilers built by Hawthorn Leslie and Company, which fed saturated steam into the turbines at a pressure of 140 lb. The turbo alternators operated at 4,800 revolutions per minute, producing single-phase electric power at 1,000 volts (V) and 80 cycles. They were also fitted with exciters at the end of their alternator shafts. In 1892, DisCo decided to improve the economy of the station by operating the turbines in conjunction with a condenser. Steam from the turbines was taken to a condenser via a wrought iron galvanised pipe in diameter. The condenser had a cooling surface of and was composed of 790 brass tubes each long and in diameter. The condenser and its pumps were placed in a pit, and driven by a tandem compound pumping engine, supported on beams above the pit. The engine ran at 60 RPM. Various turbo-generators spent time working at Forth Banks, and two 410 kW Parsons machines which spent time at the station were installed in DisCo's Lemington Power Station by 1907. By 1907, some of the original turbo alternators operating at Forth Banks had been discarded and new ones had been added due to rapid developments in the size, power and efficiency of turbo alternators. By then, the station was operating three 500 kW and six 150 kW AC turbo generators, giving a total generating capacity of 2,400 kW. The station's boiler room contained eight Lancashire boilers, each with a capacity of 200HP, and three Green economisers. Operations Coal was delivered by rail via a high level railway behind the station from Newcastle central station to bunkers in the Hawthorne Leslie yard. From here it was conveyed by chutes and screw conveyors to the boiler house. Condensing water for the station was taken from the nearby River Tyne, through a long brick tunnel. Closure and present site use A Chinese restaurant has since been built on the site of the station Because the station's buildings hadn't been constructed specifically as a power station and were already old at the time of its opening, the power station was recorded as being in a \\"rather dilapidated shape\\" in 1907. It was decided that it would have had to be rebuilt if operations were to continue. This, combined with the fact that the station only generated electricity in single phase A.C. current, led to the station being abandoned by DisCo in 1907, once the nearly adjoining Close Power Station had been completed. The station has since been demolished, and a Chinese restaurant and part of the Queen Elizabeth II Metro Bridge have since been built on the site.

Greene Press, 1976, , , p. 113  History  Thomas Osborn Perry was born in Franklin, Michigan on February 28, 1847. In 1882 and 1883, while working for the U.S. Wind Engine and Pump Company, Perry conducted a series of over five thousand experiments on windmill rotors and rotor blades. His experiments resulted in a windmill design that was 87% more efficient than other windmills manufactured at that time. Perry's main improvements were the use of concave windmill blades made from steel, rather than flat wooden blades. In order to conduct his experiments, Perry had designed and built an enclosed wind tunnel, a research tool that was not in common use at this time.A Field Guide to American Windmills, By T.

Biography A native of Kagoshima, Shimazu was largely raised at the Shimazu residence in Tokyo, where he attended the Gakushuin Peers‚Äô School. In 1904, he entered the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, and graduated from the 35th class ranked 79th out of 172 cadets. He served his midshipman duty aboard the cruiser and battleship . After being commissioned as an ensign, he was assigned to the cruisers and . Shimazu returned to specialized weaponry schools and became a torpedo and naval artillery expert. As a sub-lieutenant, he served on the battleship and again on Katori. From 1911-1913, he left active service to assume his seat in the House of Peers, returning in December 1914 to the battleship after having completed navigation and advanced gunnery training. As lieutenant, he served aboard the and during World War I, but saw no combat. After graduation from the Japanese Naval War College in December 1920, he was promoted to lieutenant commander. He went England at his own expense from December 1921 to 1923. On his return, he was appointed to the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff and became an instructor at the Naval War College. He was promoted to commander in December 1924. Shimazu was then appointed as military attach√© to England from December 1928 to December 1930. While in England, he was promoted to captain. After his return to Japan, Shimazu served on the Navy General Staff, and was promoted to rear admiral on 15 November 1935. He retired from active service a month later, on 15 December 1935. After retirement, he served in an advisory capacity to the Gakushuin. During the occupation of Japan, his palace in Tokyo (which had been designed by Josiah Conder in 1915), was seized by the American occupation forces, and is now the main hall for Seisen University. In the postwar era, he was involved in a number of financial scandals, notably with regards to the Shimazu Kosan Company. He was forced to sell off most of his inheritance to make ends meet, including the Shimazu clan archives, which went to Tokyo University. He died in 1968 at the age of 81.

Its philosophy is to \\"combine world-class academic research with a commitment to improving the lives and situations for some of the world's most disadvantaged people\\".Refugee Studies Centre, University of Oxford, UK.  Overview  The RSC is regarded as one of the world's leading centres for multidisciplinary research and teaching on the causes and consequences of forced migration. In 2002, the RSC was awarded a Queen's Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further Education in recognition of its pioneering research and innovative education, training and outreach programmes.Refugee Studies Centre, University of Oxford, UK. The Centre's influence relies on an extensive network of relationships with other universities, research institutions, governments, international organisations, NGOs, and businesses. The RSC, as part of the Oxford Department of International Development, is located at 3 Mansfield Road in Oxford, England.  Research  The RSC carries out independent, multidisciplinary research on the causes, consequences, and responses to forced migration, with the emphasis on understanding the experiences of forced migration from the point of view of affected peoples. Its academic staff have expertise across various different disciplines, including law, international relations, anthropology, politics, history, economics, and geography. The programme of research is organised around three broad areas. The first focuses on the political, economic and social contexts which are significant in understanding forced migration. The second area involves primarily anthropological, psychosocial and sociological research on the lived reality and experience and management of displacement. The third research area entails legal and political research on the development and implementation of laws and policies that relate to forced migrants.  Study and learning  The MSc in Refugee and Forced Migration Studies course offered by the RSC places forced migration in a historical, global and human context, encouraging informed reflection on international and national responses to both internal and international displacement. The two- week International Summer School in Forced Migration is for practitioners, policymakers and academics involved with assistance and policy making for refugees and internally displaced persons. The RSC's short courses give participants the opportunity to receive additional professional training and develop expertise in particular refugee-related areas. Visiting Fellowships are available to senior practitioners and policymakers, post-graduate students, post-doctoral scholars and professional academics who wish to undertake a specific programme of self-directed study in an academic environment.  Outreach  Forced Migration Review (FMR) is regarded by the humanitarian community as the world's most widely read journal on international refugee, statelessness and displacement issues. Published in English, Arabic, Spanish and French, it is distributed without charge to a global readership of over 12,000 organisations and individuals. The majority of its readers are from the South. Forced Migration Online (FMO)Forced Migration Online . is a web-based portal providing a wide variety of resources dealing with the situation of forced migrants worldwide. FMO was set up to offer free access to comprehensive information in an impartial environment and to promote increased awareness of human displacement issues to an international community of users. Its range of resources include a digital library of over 200,000 pages, access to back issues of journals, thematic and country-specific research guides, a directory of key organisations and an expanding multimedia section. The library and documentation centre of the RSC holds a large number of published and unpublished materials and research archives relating to the causes, experiences, consequences and implications of forced displacement. Its current catalogued collection comprises over 39,000 bibliographic records. In August 2009 the collection was integrated into the Bodleian Social Science Library. In addition to scholarly books and articles by staff published externally, the RSC publishes a Research in Brief series, a Working Paper Series and sponsors the Journal of Refugee Studies and the Studies in Forced Migration book series. The RSC organises events in response to emerging research agendas as well as to the policy needs of international NGOs, intergovernmental and government agencies. The RSC's weekly seminars and annual lectures are open to the public. The RSC has a programme of institutional links with Southern-based agencies and academic centres involved in the study of forced migration; it works in partnership with academics, policy makers and practitioners in the South and North concerned with forced migration to strengthen research and teaching capacities and to improve policy and project practice. The RSC was the original home of the International Association for the Study of Forced Migration.

Seeing its basic function as training and developing leaders in low-income communities, Gamaliel‚Äôs goal is \\"to assist local community leaders to create, maintain and expand independent, grassroots, and powerful faith-based community organizations\\" that have the power to influence political and economic decisions that impact cities and regions. The name \\"Gamaliel\\" refers to the Biblical wise man who was a teacher to St. Paul (see Acts 5:38-39; and Acts 22:3), whom Saul Alinsky considered to be the first great congregation- based organizer. Gamaliel Foundation works in the community organizing tradition of Alinsky, who began his work in Chicago with the Back of the Yards Neighborhood Council in 1939. Following Alinsky‚Äôs death in 1972, his Industrial Areas Foundation, under executive director Edward T. Chambers, moved toward a congregation-based organizing model, emphasizing training and leadership development. Gamaliel has developed along a similar path under the direction of Galluzzo, a former Roman Catholic priest who got his introduction to community organizing in the early 1970s in Chicago, where he worked with the Pilsen Neighborhood Community Council, mentored by such organizers as Tom Gaudette and John Baumann (the founder of PICO National Network). Governance Gamaliel‚Äôs board of directors has 15 members, and is the ultimate governing authority for the organization, setting policy and overseeing management. The board and staff are advised by the National Clergy Caucus, the African American Leadership Commission, and the International Leadership Assembly. Gamaliel operates with a small staff (approximately 20 in 2008), supplemented by interns and consultants. For example, during the period Barack Obama worked as a community organizer with the Developing Communities Project on the far South Side of Chicago (1985-1988), he was also a consultant and trainer for the Gamaliel Foundation.Obama, \\"Why Organize?\\" in After Alinsky, p. 36: \\"He has also been a consultant and instructor for the Gamaliel Foundation, an organizing institute working throughout the Midwest.\\" Gamaliel has five regional directors covering the Eastern, Mideastern, Midwestern, Southern, and Western United States. Affiliated organizations are incorporated separately, raise their own funds, and employ their own organizers. Ana Garcia Ashley became the executive director of Gamaliel in January 2011. Current program Gamaliel has refocused its efforts from neighborhood organizations to coalitions that can influence wider metropolitan areas and regions.Swarts, Organizing Urban America, p. 114. Gamaliel has begun to formulate strategies for impacting national policy on such issues as comprehensive immigration reform, health care for all, jobs and full employment, affordable housing, and equal access public transportation systems. The Transportation Equity Network (TEN) is a Gamaliel project. To date, the major focus of Gamaliel has been such metropolitan areas as Chicago, St. Louis, Cleveland, Detroit, Northwest Indiana, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, and Kansas City, Missouri. Gamaliel‚Äôs long- range plan is to build a metropolitan organization in every major population area in the United States over the next ten years, including raising the necessary money and recruiting the 200 professional organizers essential to reach this goal. Training Gamaliel conducts one-week national leadership trainings three times a year in the United States and once a year in South Africa. A three-day advanced training is held annually for leaders who have attended the seven-day national training. A three-day pastors training is offered for leaders who pastor churches. Each December Gamaliel holds a three- day staff training retreat for all the organizers in its network. Gamaliel also conducts numerous half-day, full-day, and weekend trainings for local communities. Ntosake (\\"she who walks with lions and carries her own things\\") is a year-long Gamaliel women‚Äôs empowerment and leadership development program. Themes of Gamaliel trainings include such topics as \\"the world as it is\\" versus \\"the world as it should be,\\" engaging the public arena, principles of congregation-based community organizing, power, self-interest, \\"one-on-one\\" relational meetings as a building block of organizing, agitation, metropolitan organizing, and building and sustaining an organization.Jacobsen, Doing Justice (2001).

It is situated in southern Maine, in the town of Scarborough, in Cumberland County. Scarborough Marsh About The marsh is fed by four rivers and several creeks. Three of the rivers in the Scarborough Marsh feed into and create the Scarborough River, which flows into Saco Bay and the Gulf of Maine. The main waterways in the marsh are the Libby River, Nonesuch River, Dunstan River, Scarborough River, Jones Creek, Mill Brook, Phillips Brook, Finnerd Brook, and Cascade Brook. There are many other minor creeks that feed the main waterways. Salt marshes filter pollution from the water and provide food and shelter for numerous species of birds, fish, mammals, and shellfish. Given the wildlife productivity and habitat diversity in this area, Scarborough Marsh is considered by the state of Maine as the most significant of Maine's coastal Focus Areas. It is the largest salt marsh in the state. Before the marsh was protected by the state ownership, there was considerable construction on some of the higher lands in and around the marsh, which stretches from Old Orchard Beach, south of Scarborough, nearly to Cape Elizabeth, to the town's north. The acreage of the Scarborough Marsh Wildlife Management Area continues to grow as a result of organizations such as the Friends of Scarborough Marsh and the Scarborough Land Trust and the town of Scarborough, buying or taking donated ownership of privately held land within or bordering the marshland. U.S. Route 1 cuts through a section of the marsh in what was formerly referred to as the Dunstan Corner section of the town. There are two commercial oyster farms and hundreds of commercial and recreational clammers operating in the marsh. Commercial lobstermen dock their boats in one of the rivers. The town provides a limited number of recreational boat tie-ups. Ecology The marsh is a stopover on the Atlantic Flyway, so a myriad of waterfowl can be spotted on the way to Canada in the spring and south to their wintering areas in the fall. Seals or an occasional porpoise on the hunt for food can be seen in the Scarborough River. The majority of Scarborough Marsh, Maine's largest saltwater marsh complex, has been negatively impacted by man-made ditches, which have been used to drain the marsh, lowering the natural water table and reducing the number of permanent pools on the high marsh. Since early 2000, with the creation of the Friends of Scarborough Marsh, hundreds of acres of open water habitat have been restored by plugging existing ditches and re-creating pools. The new permanent pools on the high marsh again became home for cordgrass, aquatic invertebrates, mosquito-eating saltmarsh fish and waterbirds including black ducks and glossy ibis. This is the first of many saltmarsh restoration projects to be completed by the Friends of Scarborough Marsh and its partners including Ducks Unlimited Inc., Maine's Department of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Maine Audubon Society.  History  In the past, it was believed that by draining marshes, mosquitoes could be eliminated, when, in fact, the opposite occurred. By draining marshes, the aquatic life that consumed mosquitoes disappeared. Additionally, in the 1800s, settlers created the ditches that redirected water flow so that they could maximize the farming of salt grasses. Abenaki Indians called the marsh Owascoag, meaning \\"a place of much grass.\\" In 1658, the Massachusetts General Court incorporated all the villages around the marsh as one town and renamed them Scarborough, after the city in Yorkshire, England. At that time, Maine was part of Massachusetts.  Recreation areas  Scarborough Marsh observation tower The town's Pine Point Beach, Western Beach and Ferry Beach abut the marsh with frontage on Saco Bay. The Eastern Trail, on right-of-way of the former Portland, Saco & Portsmouth Railroad, provides a path for walking, biking, cross-country skiing and bird watching. The Eastern Trail is the southern Maine section of the East Coast Greenway. The town marina, on King Street at the end of Pine Point, provides a place for boaters to put in their water craft, with the marsh on the northwest and Saco Bay on the southeast. The town's harbor master has an office just off the marina. On the opposite side of the Scarborough River is another launch ramp for boaters. It is accessed through the Ferry Beach parking lot. A gravel launch into the Nonesuch River is at the end of Winnocks Neck. Maine Audubon operates a nature center on Pine Point Road and provides canoes for use on the Dunstan and Scarborough rivers. In the marsh itself, many species of fish feed in the rivers and, consequently, many fishermen can be found there. Hunting is permitted, as well. An observation tower is a short walk from the IF&W-maintained; parking area off Manson Libby Road. The tower, a former cell tower on what was until recently land owned by the Gervais family, provides a view of the Dunstan River weaving through marshland.

It is now the Diocese of Pointe-Noire, in the Republic of the Congo. History Formerly included in the Kingdom of Congo, the Kingdom of Loango became independent towards the end of the sixteenth century, at which time it extended from the mouth of the Kwilou to that of the River Congo. By the treaties of 1885 all this country, over which Portugal had till then exercised a somewhat uncertain sway, became part of French Congo, except the enclave of Cabinda which still remained under Portuguese control. Ecclesiastical administration The transference of civil dominion affected the ecclesiastical distribution of the territory. By decree of 24 November 1886, the Vicariate Apostolic of French Congo, or Lower Congo, more properly Loango, was detached from that of Gaboon; and in 1890, as a result of further division, the Vicariate of Upper French Congo, or Ubangi, was erected. The three vicariates which made up French Congo ‚Äî Gaboon, Loango, Ubangi ‚Äî embraced an area, approximately, of one million square miles. The Vicariate Apostolic of Loango lay to the south of that of Gaboon; on the west, it was bounded by the Atlantic; on the south, by the Massabi River, Cabinda, and Belgian Congo; to the east is the Vicariate of Ubangi, from which it is separated by the Djue River as far as the upper reaches of that river, and thence onward by a line drawn to meet the head waters of the Alima River. The natives are Bantu people, speaking numerous dialects the most important of which is the Kivili. Amongst those contributed to the knowledge of the language were Mgr Carrie, the first Apostolic vicar, and Mgr Derouet, his successor. The vicariate was in the charge of the Congregation of the Holy Ghost. The station at Loango was on the route to Brazzaville, and had a printing establishment. The seminary and house of novices were at Mayumba, where Ignace Stoffel founded the mission in 1888. Jean Derouet was of the Congregation of the Holy Ghost and of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, and titular Bishop of Camachus. He was born at Saint-Denis-de-Villenette, Diocese of S√©ez, Orne, France, 31 January 1866. Ordained in 1891, he went as missionary to the Congo, and in 1904 was named pro-Vicar Apostolic of Loango. He was chosen bishop on 19 December 1906; consecrated 3 February 1907, in the chapel of the Holy Ghost, at Paris; preconized on 18 April of the same year; and appointed Vicar Apostolic of Lower French Congo.

Of mixed European and Chickasaw ancestry, Colbert was born to his mother's Chickasaw clan and gained significance in the tribe's history through his family's privileged mixed-race status. Educated in an American school, he knew of both European-American and Chickasaw cultures and contributed to his clan as a mediator between both worlds. He helped write the Chickasaw Nation's constitution in the 1850s after its removal to Indian Territory and reorganization of its government. After the American Civil War, Colbert then went on to serve as the tribe's delegate. Early life and education Holmes Colbert was the son of James Isaac Colbert and Sarah \\"Sally\\" McLish. His father James Isaac Colbert, the son of Maj. James Holmes Colbert, already had some remote Chickasaw blood since he was the grandson of James Logan Colbert, a Scots trader from North Carolina who settled in Chickasaw country in the mid-18th century, and of his third wife, Minta Hoye, who had a Chickasaw mother herself. Since the Chickasaw have a matrilineal system, children are considered born into their mother's clan and gain recognition in the tribe through her legacy, including any hereditary leadership positions ; the whole Colbert family was hence considered a part of the Chickasaw Nation. Regarding the Colberts, the status of the men's mothers, combined with their fathers' access to trade goods, led the male members of the family to become prominent landowners and leaders within the Chickasaw Nation\\"George Colbert\\", Oklahoma Encyclopedia of History and Culture, accessed 3 Nov 2009. In all likelihood, Holmes and his wife Betsy had six sons themselves , though divergent sources mention that they had only five. Colberts' leadership contributions Historical records indicate that Holmes had six sons going by the names of William, George, Levi, Samuel, Joseph, and Pittman (or James). For nearly a century, the Colberts and their male descendants provided critical leadership as the Chickasaw faced their greatest challenges. The Chickasaw allied with the United States during the War of 1812. William Colbert served under General Andrew Jackson against the Red Sticks during the Creek Wars of 1813-14, a civil war within the Creek involving multiple factions as well as European and US belligerents, and his brothers George and Levi also joined the army. Within their clan and the Chickasaw Nation, the brothers were both affluent landowners and a political force to be reckoned with. George and Levi Colbert served as negotiators and interpreters in the 1820s-1830 during the tribe's negotiations with the US government related to Indian Removal. Political career Holmes grew up learning about his family's leadership and was groomed for taking responsibilities in tribal affairs. He and his cousin Winchester created the governmental foundation of the Chickasaw Nation in Indian Territory (now known as Oklahoma). In the 1850s, Holmes Colbert helped write the constitution for their government , as after the Choctaw‚ÄìChickasaw Treaty of 1854, the Chickasaw constitution, establishing the nation as separate from the Choctaw, was signed in Tishomingo on the 30th of August, 1856. Marriage and children Colbert married Elizabeth Betsy Love, daughter of Henry W. Love and his wife Sarah Ann Moore. Henry W Love son of Thomas Love wife Sally Colbert . They were both well educated, having been sent to schools out of state.\\"Polly Colbert\\", T. Lindsay Baker, The WPA Oklahoma Slave Narratives, US Work Projects Administration, p. 90, accessed 3 Nov 2009 Their mothers' clans were influential families in the Chickasaw Nation who were grooming their children for the future and believed they needed education to deal with European- Americans. The Colberts had three children together, but two died before the American Civil War. Colbert and his wife owned about of cleared land, with more in timber. They held eight adult enslaved African Americans and several children in what is now Oklahoma. family history states James Holmes Colbert son of James Issac son of James Holmes son of, James Logan was born September 22, 1828 in Marshall County, Mississippi, and died March 24, 1872 in Washington, D.C..He married Elizabeth Love, daughter of Henry Love and Sarah Moore.She was born Abt. 1833 in Mississippi, and died 1914.\\\\\\\\\\\\ Love daughter Henry W.son of Sally Colbert,daughter James Logan) was born Abt. 1833 in Mississippi, and died 1914.She married James Holmes Colbert, son of James Colbert and Sarah McLish.He was born September 22, 1828 in Marshall County, Mississippi, and died March 24, 1872 in Washington, D.C..

Chickasaw delegate After the American Civil War, the US required a new treaty from the Chickasaw, as the tribe had supported the Confederacy. Holmes Colbert represented the tribe as a delegate to Washington, DC during these negotiations and later to Congress. One of the provisions of the peace treaty required the Chickasaw to emancipate their slaves, as the US had done, and offer those who wanted to stay in Indian Territory citizenship as Chickasaw or relocate to become US citizens. Their decision during this time to refuse citizenship to the Freedmen who stayed, as well as having previously formed an alliance with the Confederacy, likely played a role in the decision for the US government to take over half the land the Chickasaw owned from previous treaties without any compensation. Unlike the Freedmen of the other \\"Five Civilized Tribes,\\" from emancipation in 1866 up until Oklahoma gained statehood in 1907, Freedmen that remained inside Chickasaw boundaries were essentially country-less. However they were later documented as Chickasaw Freedmen on the Dawes Rolls. Legacy *The constitution of the Chickasaw Nation *Colbert, Oklahoma was named after the family.

The inholding began as a 1914 homestead belonging to Harry and Elizabeth Sensenbach, who began in the 1920s to supplement their income by catering to automobile-borne tourists. In 1946 the property was purchased by Charles Byron, Jeanne Jenkins and Gloria Jenkins Wardell, who expanded the accommodations by one or two cabins a year in a U-shaped layout around a central lodge. The lodge and cabins are constructed in a rustic log style, considered compatible with park architecture. The Highlands was neither an auto camp, which encouraged short stays, nor a dude ranch, which provided ranch-style activities. The Highlands encouraged stays of moderate length, providing a variety of relatively sedentary amenities. It was the last private-accommodation camp to be built in the park before the Mission 66 program created concessioner-operated facilities on public lands. The National Park Service acquired the property in 1972 and uses it to house seasonal employees. The acquisition allowed the Park Service to demolish most of the nearby Mages Ranch - Elbo Ranch property. The Highlands was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 19, 1998.

During the weekly intermission, William John Cameron (former editor of the Dearborn Independent and directly responsible for the publication in the 1920s of the anti-Semitic Protocols of the Elders of Zion), of the Ford Motor Company, delivered brief talks on a variety of topics from sports to economics. These talks were collected into several books published by Ford. Announcers included Ron Gamble and Truman Bradley. Replacements During the summer months, it was replaced by The Ford Summer Hour, featuring Donald Voorhees, Meredith Willson, James Melton, Francia White and Jane Pickens. One week after The Ford Sunday Evening Hour came to an end, the Ford Motor Company launched The Ford Festival of American Music which offered the full spectrum of popular music, from swing to show tunes, along with folk and classical selections. Leigh Harline conducted the orchestra, and Alfred Drake was the host of the show, produced by George Zachary. It aired from June 30 to September 22, 1946. Re-enactment On July 28, 1963, the National High School Symphony Orchestra of Interlochen, Michigan, performed a re-enactment of the program to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Henry Ford's birth and the 60th anniversary of Ford Motor Company.

Biography William Colbeck was born on 8 August 1871, at Myton Place, Kingston-upon-Hull, Yorkshire. He was the fifth child in a family of ten born to Christopher Colbeck, a baker, and his wife Martha. Educated at Hull Grammar School, Colbeck served a merchant navy apprenticeship on the Loch Torridon between 1886 and 1890 and completed a six-month course in navigation before going to sea.Borchgrevink 1901 He earned his second mate's certificate in Calcutta in 1890, first mate's certificate in July 1892, master's in March 1894. He joined the firm of Tomas Wilson, Sons and Co, Ltd., of Hull and served on RMS Montebello as the second mate under Captain Pepper. He passed as extra master in November 1897. He was awarded a Royal Navy reserve commission in 1898. In that year he studied at Kew Observatory making a special feature of magnetism and it was in the capacity of Magnetic Observer that he was invited by the Norwegian Carsten Borchgrevink to join the Southern Cross Expedition to the Antarctic. This would be the first expedition to overwinter on the Antarctic mainland; Colbeck took charge of the expedition's magnetic observation work. After returning to Britain in 1900, Colbeck was soon going southward again, this time in command of the relief ship , sent to resupply Robert Falcon Scott's , then trapped in the ice at McMurdo Sound in the Antarctic.Crane, pp. 232‚Äì240. He was awarded the Royal Geographical Society's Back Award in 1901. On their way south the Morning celebrated Christmas Day 1902 by crossing the Antarctic Circle and discovering a previously uncharted island which they named Scott Island. Colbeck and three officers landed on the island where they collected rock samples and had a drink. The adjacent cone-shaped islet Colbeck named Haggitt's Pillar, after his mother's maiden name. In January 1904, Colbeck returned with Morning, this time with firm instructions that unless Discovery could be speedily released from the ice, she was to be abandoned; Colbeck was to bring Scott and the expedition home. In a race against time, and with a fortunate shift in ice conditions, Discovery was freed and sailed safely home.Crane, pp. 277‚Äì287. Thereafter Colbeck made no further Antarctic ventures but resumed his job with the Wilson line in Hull. In 1914 he went to work for the United Shipping Company of London, ultimately becoming their Marine Superintendent. The family moved to south London, living at 51 Inchmery Road, Catford. Captain Colbeck became a founder member of the Honourable Company of Master Mariners. In 1930 he was elected President of the Antarctic Club but died suddenly later that year of heart failure, after a bout of bronchitis. He is buried in Hither Green Cemetery. Colbeck married Edith Robinson and they had four sons. One of these, William Robinson Colbeck, joined the British Australia and New Zealand Antarctic expeditions of 1929‚Äì1931 as second officer and navigator in the old Discovery. He was responsible for much of the charting during the two voyages, and the Colbeck Archipelago‚Äîoff the Mawson Coast‚Äîis named after him.Maritime Historical Studies Centre.The Colbecks.

He was defeated in the Republican primary in his 2008 bid for a full term. 2007 House appointment In October 2007, Bruce announced his plans to seek a seat in the Colorado House of Representatives. After Rep. Bill Cadman was appointed to fill a Senate seat vacated by Ron May, Bruce sought to be appointed to Cadman's seat representing House District 15. Bruce faced two other Republican challengers for the appointment during a short but contentious battle for the vacancy committee nomination, during which he questioned the professional credentials of one of his opponents, and opponents charged that he was too divisive a figure to successfully represent the district. Ultimately, Bruce received two-thirds of the votes from the 66 members of the vacancy committee, beating out former school board candidate and engineer Reginald Perry and businessman Steve Hasbrouck. 2008 legislative session Swearing-in controversy Bruce postponed being sworn in until January 14, 2008--several days after the start of the legislative session--in order to be eligible to serve a full four terms beyond the partial term under Colorado's term limits rules. The move was criticized by former Republican Senator Ron May and Democratic House Speaker Andrew Romanoff, who, in response to Bruce's actions, called for legislation requiring that newly appointed legislators be sworn in within a specific period of time. Such a bill, which would require appointed legislators to be sworn in within 14 days of their selection, was introduced later in the session by Democratic Reps. Paul Weissmann and Dorothy Butcher; Bruce took the unusual step for a legislator of testifying against the bill at a committee hearing, but the bill passed the state house, with Bruce casting the only dissenting vote. Bruce clashed with legislative leaders over the time of his swearing-in, demanding to be sworn in at 10 a.m. in front of the full house. Both Speaker Romanoff and Republican leader Mike May requested that Bruce take the oath at a different time, as is customary for vacancy appointments, in order not to interfere with House business. Bruce was present at the 10 a.m. start of legislative business on January 14, but he was not officially recognized by Speaker Romanoff during the morning session. After House Republicans voted 22-1 to call for a representative to be named for District 15 if Bruce did not take the oath of office by the end of the day, Bruce was sworn in by Romanoff at 1:30 p.m. Already fined for an unexcused absence from the commission meeting on Monday morning, Bruce submitted his resignation as an El Paso County Commissioner after being sworn in as a state representative, effective January 15. After his resignation, Bruce sent a letter to the vacancy committee members who would choose his replacement criticizing Amy Lathen, the leading candidate for his commission seat, as unqualified and inconsistent on tax issues, calling her a \\"Republican in Name Only;\\" the letter was denounced by El Paso County Republican Party officials. Lathen, who had planned for months to run a primary campaign for the commission seat against Bruce, was elected by the vacancy committee with a majority of votes on the first ballot. Censure On the morning before he was sworn in, Bruce was present on the house floor during the session's morning prayer. Javier Manzano, a Rocky Mountain News photographer, took Bruce's picture during the prayer; Bruce kicked him in the knee, telling Manzano, \\"Do not do that again.\\" Bruce later accused the photographer of \\"violating the order and decorum\\" of the house and refused to apologize. Republican Minority Leader Mike May issued a formal apology to the photographer, and state Republican chairman Dick Wadhams \\"strongly denounce[d]\\" Bruce's actions. Speaker Romanoff and Minority Leader May convened a bipartisan six-member panel to investigate and made recommendations concerning the incident; on Friday, January 18, the panel recommended 6-0 that Bruce be censured by the House for his actions, and 5-1 that a formal apology be requested from Bruce. Although Manzano testified before the panel, he declined to press criminal charges against Bruce. Romanoff elected to pursue the censure recommendation, and, on January 24, the full House of Representatives voted 62-1 (with only Rep. Kevin Lundberg opposed) to censure Bruce. He became the first representative in the recorded history of the state house to be formally censured. Legislative agenda For the 2008 session of the Colorado General Assembly, Bruce was named to seats on the House Finance Committee and the House State, Veterans, and Military Affairs Committee. At the start of the 2008 General Assembly session, before being sworn in, Bruce announced his opposition to a large portion of the House Republican caucus legislative agenda, including a sales tax holiday for school supplies, a pine beetle mitigation fund, new specialty license plates, and targeted tax credits, noting in a letter to Republican whip Cory Gardner: \\"I thought the GOP was the party of less government and more freedom, of protecting individualism, not streamlining socialism.\\" The first bill introduced by Bruce during the 2008 session was a measure to require the Colorado Department of Education to distribute copies of the Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution to high school seniors, to mandate classroom instruction on the documents, l and to offer a brief constitutional law course to members of the Colorado General Assembly. The bill died after facing unanimous opposition from the House Education Committee. Another of Bruce's bills, which would have prohibited counties from assessing any charges other than property taxes, including fines for delinquent payments or stormwater fees, on property tax bills, was also killed in committee. Bruce also advanced a measure which would have eliminated per diem expense payments for legislators and indexed legislators' pay to inflation, as well as requiring voter approval for any pay increases above this amount. All four bills introduced by Bruce were killed in committee. Late in the legislative session, Bruce introduced a bill to create a seven-member bipartisan panel, including three unaffiliated voters, to draw up Colorado's congressional and legislative districts following the 2010 census and reapportionment. Bruce has also objected to the practice of attaching a \\"safety clause\\" to bills, a provision which uses a declaration that the bill is \\"necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety\\" to change the date of enactment and prohibit challenges to the legislation via the petition process. He has pledged to vote against all legislation containing an unjustified safety clause, and has offered amendments to a number of bills to remove the safety clause. Bruce's amendments often failed on account of legislators' personal hostility towards him; on at least one occasion, after the house voted down his proposal to strike the safety clause, the motion passed after being introduced by another legislator. House members eventually developed the practice of supporting the removal of the safety clause if the legislator sponsoring the bill agreed; in 2008, 41% of bill passed had no safety clause, up from 25% the previous year. Bruce also proposed several changes to House operations and procedure, including use of tasers by state capitol security--a proposal received favorably by legislative leaders --and increased office space for legislators--an idea not well received. Bruce was a vocal critic of the proposed state budget debated during the 2008 legislative session, characterizing the budget's $3,500 in expenditures per Colorado resident as \\"fiscal child abuse.\\" During budget debates, Bruce offered unsuccessful amendments to eliminate 524 new employees at colleges and universities, to cut a federally funded program for prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, and to prevent the transfer of 165 contract corrections employees to state payrolls. Bruce also joined with left-leaning and environmental groups in opposing proposed changes to Colorado's petition process that would raise signature requirements and make it more difficult to put proposals to amend the Colorado state constitution on the statewide ballot. Bruce also entered into debate on, and voted against, a bill to impose new requirements on landlords and set standards for rental properties. His actions generated criticism from other legislators, who argued that Bruce should have recused himself from voting on the measure because his ownership of rental properties created a conflict of interest; two other legislators recused themselves for similar reasons. Removal from committee On February 13, Bruce, alone among 100 state legislators, refused to sign on as a cosponsor to an annual joint resolution recognizing Military and Veterans Appreciation Day. Bruce had protested other resolutions in the legislature as a waste of time, similar to his practice of refusing to vote on resolutions as an El Paso County commissioner. Later in the session, Bruce proposed a change to House rules to allow members to abstain from voting on resolutions. In response to public complaints, Republican Minority Leader Mike May removed Bruce from the House State, Veterans and Military Affairs Committee, which oversees veterans' issues. Bruce dismissed the move as \\"political posturing.\\" Other Republican legislators denounced Bruce in a public letter for \\"callous indifference\\" towards veterans. Bruce offered as evidence of his support for veterans his successful amendment to a house bill to include interest in a state repayment to the Colorado Veterans Trust Fund, a move which resulted in an additional $636,000 repaid to the fund. Bruce would later cite this as one of his major accomplishments during the 2008 session. The following week, Bruce signed on as a cosponsor to an annual resolution calling for civility between members of the legislature; he said that it did not violate his standard of refusing to support symbolic resolutions because he considered the measure to be a \\"pledge of personal behavior.\\" Per diem controversy As a legislator, Bruce was entitled to apply for per diem compensation for living expenses during the legislative session. After having delayed his swearing into the state house for five days after the start of the session, Bruce applied for and received compensation for those days amounting to $750 more than what he was legally entitled to. Colorado legislative council staff later accepted responsibility for what was referred to as a \\"clerical error\\" and has pledged to return the excess funds. Bruce has pledged to donate his legislative salary and per diem payments to the non-profit charity \\"Active Citizens Together,\\" a group founded by Bruce to educate citizens on personal and property rights and advocate for limited government. \\"Illiterate peasants\\" comments On April 21, 2008, Bruce voiced opposition during house debate on a bill sponsored by Rep. Marsha Looper to create a guest worker program to facilitate temporary employment visas for agricultural workers from Mexico. After speaking against illegal immigration and being advised to restrict comments to the bill by debate chair Rep. Kathleen Curry, Bruce took the floor a second time and commented: Bruce was immediately gavelled to order by Rep. Curry, who ruled that he would no longer be recognized during debate on the bill. Bruce's comments were denounced by Assistant Majority Leader Terrance Carroll as violating the \\"decorum of the house;\\" they were also criticized by Minority Leader Mike May, the Mexican consulate in Denver. and the Anti-Defamation League. The following day, the Latino Faith-Based Initiative, and the Democratic Party Latino Initiative both called for Bruce's resignation from the legislature. Bruce defended his remarks as being factually accurate, citing dictionary definitions of \\"illiterate\\" and \\"peasant\\". Legislators briefly considered bringing a formal ethics complaint against him, but ultimately chose not to. Legislators responded to Bruce's propensity for generating controversy by declaring that they would \\"start ignoring him\\". Rep. Curry requested additional law enforcement protection after receiving an influx of threatening messages from opponents of illegal immigration. Bruce, however, received hundreds of largely positive email messages in response to news coverage of the controversy. The following weekend, Bruce's comments were the target of a local protest in Colorado Springs attended by about 50. Several days later, Bruce submitted an amendment -- facetiously drafted by the \\"linguistic sensitivity codification commission\\" -- to another bill addressing immigration issues to substitute \\"undocumented, temporary guest resident\\" in place of \\"illegal aliens\\" in statutory language. The amendment was offered and defeated twice. Sexual harassment complaint On April 30, Bruce was the subject of a sexual harassment complaint after a female legislative staffer alleged that he made inappropriate verbal comments towards her. After being formally confronted by House Speaker Andrew Romanoff, Bruce was instructed to stay away from the woman who filed the complaint, according to reports by other representatives. Legislative leaders refused to publicly discuss the complaint, but Douglas Bruce stated in a radio interview that the incident in question involved only looking and smiling at a woman. After both Bruce and the woman involved were interviewed by attorneys, Bruce reported in July that the harassment complaint had been dismissed for lack of evidence, and suggested that the timing of the investigation's conclusion was politically motivated, coming just weeks before a contested primary race. 2008 election Bruce announced in November 2007 that he would stand in the 2008 general election for the House District 15 seat. He faces a challenge for the Republican nomination from attorney and Iraq War veteran Mark Waller. Following the precedent of his county commission campaign four years earlier, Bruce funded his own campaign, refusing to accept private campaign donations; instead, Bruce donated over $30,000 of his own money to his campaign. He did, however, unsuccessfully solicit donations for his charity, Active Citizens Together, from other lawmakers. Reflecting Bruce's status as a \\"pariah\\" among some Colorado Springs Republicans, Waller received endorsements or contributions during his campaign from at least five sitting state representatives, including Bob Gardner, Larry Liston, and Marsha Looper, as well as former Sen. Ron May and Colorado Attorney General John Suthers. Waller outpolled Bruce by receiving 57% of the vote at the Republican assembly in March, claiming the top line on the August Republican primary ballot; he was supported by some delegates who had voted for Bruce's legislative appointment months earlier. During his campaign, Waller did not draw a contrast on political positions with Bruce, but argued that Bruce's temperament caused him to be an ineffective legislator. Bruce faced criticism from House Democratic and Republican leaders in April for distributing campaign fliers critical of Waller to Republican representatives on the House floor. Although not a violation of the law or House rules, legislative leaders denounced the action as a breach of decorum and tradition. Waller also called for Bruce's resignation in April 2008, after Bruce's controversial comments about Mexican guest workers. Bruce, in response, characterised Waller as a \\"conformer\\" rather than a \\"reformer,\\" and stated that his controversial actions were designed to draw attention to inappropriate legislative actions. Shortly before the August primary, Bruce was again criticized by Waller for mailing flyers promoting his charity, Active Citizens Together, soliciting volunteers and donations for the charity and stating: \\"to reform government, ACT with Douglas Bruce.\\" Although Waller declared that the flyers were \\"an obvious attempt at campaigning,\\" he did not file a complaint with the Colorado Secretary of State's office, as he believed no laws were actually broken; the flyers did not mention any of Bruce's elected positions. Bruce was also criticized for listing endorsements on his website from political officials who had endorsed his campaign for county commissioner, but not specifically endorsed his legislative campaign. After attention was called to the discrepancy, Bruce had the erroneous endorsements removed, citing an \\"overzealous webmaster.\\" In turn, Bruce filed several campaign finance complaints against Waller, all but one of which--an accusation that Waller improperly accepted a corporate donation--were dismissed. The hearing on Bruce's complaint was postponed until after the primary, over Bruce's objection, but resulted in Waller being cited and fined for failing to disclose a campaign contribution. Bruce also criticized Waller for his failure to vote in several recent elections, including the 2004 general election. Bruce was narrowly defeated for the Republican nomination in the August 12 party primary, taking only 48 percent of the vote to Waller's 52 percent. Democrat Allison Hunter withdrew from the race in December 2007, arguing that Bruce's appointment by a vacancy committee gave him \\"too great an advantage\\" in general election; Waller will face Democrat Michelle Maksimowicz in November 2008.

The first issue of Okyeame appeared in 1960,James Gibbs, \\"Okyeame: A Literary Journal and a Short Story\\", in Nkyin-kyin: Essays on the Ghanaian Theatre (Cross/Culturres 98), Rodopi, 2009, p. 101. and issues were published, at irregular intervals, up until 1972.\\"Okyeame\\", Chimurenga Library. (The magazine's founding date is here given as 1961.) Inspired by Kwame Nkrumah, the first Prime Minister of Ghana, the publication sought to explore the experiences of Africa from a new intellectual framework. Writers published in the magazine include its first editor Kofi Awoonor, Efua Sutherland (later also editor), Ayi Kwei Armah and Ama Ata Aidoo.Pushpa Naidu Parekh, Siga Fatima Jagne (eds), Postcolonial African Writers: A Bio-bibliographical Critical Sourcebook, Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1998, pp. 52‚Äì53. Background The publication took its name from a traditional Ghanaian figure, the \\"spokesperson\\" or \\"linguist\\" responsible for channelling communication between a leader and his people; as a symbol of his authority to speak for the chief, the okyeame carries a staff, the top of which is carved to represent a proverb or saying.\\"Ashanti Okyeame\\".\\"Linguist Staff (Okyeame)\\". Okyeame magazine sought to give voice to Kwame Nkrumah's dream of a new African identity. Articles called for a Ghanaian poetry whose content and form was based on oral tradition, drum poetry. These ran alongside traditional oral works translated by leading contemporary poets, such as founding editor Kofi Awoonor, and texts were interspersed with icons and Adinkra symbols. Like its namesake, Okyeame was not simply a mouthpiece; it was also an \\"interpreter\\" and an \\"ambassador in foreign courts\\". It provided a platform for a new generation of writers to experiment with a versatile, hybrid Pan-African linguistics that combined African oral influences with African-American literary devices; rural with urban imagery; phonetic innovations with lyricism and wordplay; and dirge rhythms with jazz free-play. The Okyeame magazine era is recalled by some scholars such as a time when its writers functioned \\"like the foot soldiers of Nkrumah in the cultural field\\".Kofi Awoonor quoted in Kwame Botwe-Asamoah, Kwame Nkrumah‚Äôs Politico-Cultural Thought and Policies, London & New York: Routledge, 2005, p. 55. Appearing sometimes twice a year, Okyeame published poetry, short stories and drama, as well as a section for news and reviews. Contributors included some of the country's most influential writers and critics, such as Ayi Kwei Armah, Ama Ata Aidoo, Efua T. Sutherland, Kofi Awoonor, and others.\\"Okyeame: Ghana's Post-Independence Literary Publication\\", Santrofi, June 23, 2016.

Quoted in Eric Bulson, \\"No. 5: Little Postcolonial Magazines\\", in Little Magazine, World Form, Columbia University Press, 2017. and the Black Orpheus reviewer (possibly Gerald Moore, who had reviewed the first issue of Okyeame in Black Orpheus no. 10) wrote: \\"The function of periodicals in nurturing the new literatures in Africa and the Caribbean cannot be overstated They represent necessary documentary proof of fashion and growth. Their function is not so much to preserve as to link.

From these modest beginnings, Moto fast became one of the most outspoken voices in the liberation war, providing scathing criticism of the colonial government and support for African nationalist parties. Banned by the Smith regime in 1974, it re-emerged in 1980, first as a newspaper and then as one of the first magazines to provide content in ChiShona, SiNdebele and English. Moto faced a new set of challenges in the post-liberation era. Firstly, it needed to make the transition from the campaigning stance it adopted in the days of Zimbabwe's Unilateral Declaration of Independence, to a critical, independent voice in the era of majority rule. Under a mandate of being \\"the voice of the voiceless and defender of the downtrodden\\", it switched its focus to issues generally marginalised by the state-controlled press, running socio-economic and human-interest stories, often set in rural communities. The magazine also had to negotiate the sometimes awkward relationship between its church base and its outspoken political stance. In this regard it regularly ran features on the formation of the African clergy, paying particular attention to the elevation of Africans to the hierarchy and the ranks of the canonized. Despite ongoing economic difficulties and opposition from the Mugabe government, who made several attempts to shut down the publication, Moto's readership continues to grow, amongst intellectuals, professionals and students, as well as rural readers.

The Jewish Board was created through the successive mergers of New York-area Jewish charitable organizations. The United Hebrew Charities was established in 1845 as an umbrella organization for the Hebrew Benevolent Fuel Association, the Ladies Benevolent Society of the Congregation of the Gates of Prayer, the Hebrew Relief Society, and the Hebrew Benevolent and Orphan Society. In 1926 it became the Jewish Social Services Association. It merged in 1946 with the Jewish Family Welfare Society of Brooklyn to form Jewish Family Services (JFS). The present-day Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services (The Jewish Board) resulted in 1978 from a further merger with the Jewish Board of Guardians. In June 2015, The Jewish Board acquired $75 million worth of behavioral health programs from the Federation Employment & Guidance Services (FEGS).Guide to the Jewish Family Service collection, 1875‚Äì1940; I-375, Center for Jewish History. Retrieved October 21, 2014.  History  United Hebrew Charities United Hebrew Charities was formed in 1874 in New York City to organize relief and charitable work for the many social service organizations across the city,YIVO Archives YIVO Institute for Jewish Research serving New York‚Äôs Jewish community and acting as a central relief organization for Jewish charities in the area. At the time, movements towards overseeing charitable organizations were widespread in New York City. Josephine Shaw Lowell, part of the State Board of Charities of New York, crafted a report that later formed the Charity Organization Society of the City of New York, the first attempt at bringing together charitable efforts through a singular board‚Äôs supervision. Fifty years of social service: The history of the United Hebrew Charities of the city of New York, now the Jewish Social Service Association, inc. HathiTrust Digital Library In 1926, United Hebrew Charities merged with the Jewish Social Service Association (JSSA), taking their name because of the stigma associated with the term ‚Äúcharity‚Äù and to better represent the organization‚Äôs focus on social work. Jewish Prisoner‚Äôs Aid Society The Jewish Prisoners Aid Society began in 1893 as a group of concerned citizens interested in providing proper chaplains to state prisons and aid to needy families of Jewish prisoners around the New York City area in order to support religiously appropriate treatment for all Jewish people incarcerated at state and city levels and their families. By 1902, JPAS became The New York Jewish Protectory and Aid Society to address increase in Jewish juvenile delinquency and incarceration,Cedar Knolls School for Girls Jewish Women's Archive and eventually merged with the New York Jewish Protectory and Aid Society in 1907.  Community Partnerships   Jewish Community Services  The Jewish Board's Jewish Community Services program provides a religious support for mental health and social services, including education on the opioid epidemic and domestic violence, to New York City's Jewish community.  Mental Health Support for Veterans  To support the mental health of veterans in the NYC Area, many of whom avoided care because they felt there was a stigma around seeking help, The Jewish Board and the Bronx VA Medical Center worked toward creating family-focused mental health services for veterans and veteran families of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars living in the Bronx, NY. The program was then expanded to provide long-term care and access for veterans and families of veterans.  NYC Students' Mental Health  The 100 Schools Project was started in 2016 in partnership with OneCity Health (NYC Health + Hospitals), Community Care of Brooklyn (Maimonides Medical Center), Bronx Health Access (Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center), and Bronx Partners for Healthy Communities (SBH Health System) to address gaps in children‚Äôs mental health resources. It connects middle and high schools in New York City with local community-based organizations and trains teachers and staff basics of diagnostic and intervention methods to help support student‚Äôs mental and behavioral health.  AIDS Education and Support  Former CEO Dr. Jerome Goldsmith, who also served on the Board of the Gay Men‚Äôs Health Crisis, was one of the first to recognize the importance of mental health services for people with HIV/AIDS, and advocated to increase the availability of mental health care for those affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic in New York City. Bob Zielony, who directed of the HIV/AIDS Prevention and Education department of The Jewish Board for six-years, was involved with outreach to Jewish communities in the New York area to educate them on the immunodeficiency virus as well as ways to prevent transmission, occasionally using Jewish-centric themes like \\"pikuach nefesh, the obligation under Jewish law to save lives under any circumstances\\" as justification for safe sex practices. In 2018, The Jewish Board acquired The Alpha Workshops, which provides training in the decorative arts as a licensed school of design for LGBTQ+ adults and/or those living with HIV/AIDS and other disabilities. Controversy Dr. Neubauer's study on monozygotic multiples In the late 1950s, Doctor Viola Bernard of Louise Wise Services, a prominent New York City Jewish adoption agency in the 1960s, created a policy to separate identical twins for adoption, with the intent that \\"early mothering would be less burdened and divided and the child‚Äôs developing individuality would be facilitated.\\" In 1961, psychiatrist Peter B. Neubauer, then director of New York's Child Development Center, began a multi-year \\"nature versus nurture\\" twin study to observe how the separated siblings would fare in different environments. This involved at least five sets of identical twins and one set of triplets deliberately separated and placed into adoptive families by Louise Wise Services under Doctor Viola Bernard's policies. As a condition of the adoption, the parents agreed to in-person visits of up to four times a year by the study's research team, where the children would be observed, questioned, tested and/or filmed, without knowing the true nature of the study. The parents of the adopted children were also not informed by Louise Wise Services that they were part of a twin or triplet set, and one biological mother to a set of twins separated by Bernard and studied by Neubauer reported that Louise Wise Services did not inform her that her children would be separated. Ultimately, one of separated siblings committed suicide. Some have drawn ethical comparisons with the notorious twin experiments by the same Nazi regime that Neubauer himself had escaped, while others have commented that the study was ethically defensible by the standards of the time. Dr. Neubauer's study was never completed, and in 1978, the Jewish Board of Guardians merged with Jewish Family Services to form the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services. The study records are currently in the custody of Yale University under seal until October 25, 2065, and cannot be released to the public without authorization from The Jewish Board, while Louse Wise Services' adoption records are held by Spence-Chapin Services to Families and Children. In 2011, two identical twins who reunited as adults, Doug Rausch and Howard Burack, sent a letter to The Jewish Board requesting to see their records. The Jewish Board initially denied that Rausch and Burack had been part of the study, until the brothers were able to produce archived notes from one of Dr. Neubauer's former research assistants proving that they were indeed part of the study. The Jewish Board says Dr. Neubauer's study records are sealed to the public until 2065 to protect the privacy of those studied. To this date, all study subjects who have requested their personal records have received them, albeit heavily redacted and inconclusive.

Weinstein's current academic project is a restructuring of contemporary liberal political theory, building off of the moral psychology and political economy of Adam Smith. In multiple volumes, Weinstein plans to offer an interpretation of Adam Smith that views his Theory of Moral Sentiments as primary and offer its connection to contemporary liberal theory. According to Weinstein, the book will ultimately elaborate on the idea that \\"Adam Smith's moral psychology offers us the framework by which we can rescue the notion of neutrality from its indefensible understanding as an Archimedean point of view.\\" Weinstein's blog PQED: Philosophical Questions About Everyday Life has inspired controversy.

Mayor of Jersey City, 113 U.S. 506 (1885), was a bill in equity filed in the Court of Chancery of New Jersey by the appellant, to foreclose two mortgages given to it on a certain lot in Jersey City, New Jersey by Michael Nugent and wife, and another person.Provident Institution for Sav. v. Mayor of Jersey City, . The first mortgage was dated January 19, 1863, to secure the payment of $900 and interest, and the second, dated July 13, 1869, to secure the payment of $700 and interest. The complainants also claimed, under the stipulations of the mortgages, the amount of certain premiums of insurance paid by them. By an amended bill making the mayor and aldermen of Jersey City a defendant, the complainants alleged that the city claimed a lien on the mortgaged premises prior to that of the mortgages for certain water rents for supplying water to the occupants of the same for the year 1871, and from thence to the time of filing the bill; that this claim was made under an act of the legislature time of filing the bill; that this claim authorizing the construction of waterworks for the city, and the act revising the city charter, passed in March 1871. The bill denied the validity of this claim, and averred that those portions of the said acts which purported to give such a priority had the effect to deprive the complainant of its property in the mortgaged premises without due process of law, and were in violation of the Constitution of the United States as well as that of New Jersey, and the complainant prayed for a foreclosure and sale of the lot in question as against all the defendants. There was annexed to the bill and referred to therein a copy of the \\"Tariff of Rates and Regulations for the Use of Passaic Water; also Rules Regulating the Plumbing of Houses and the Tapping of Sewers,\\" being the regulations adopted by the Board of Public Works of Jersey City under the statutes referred to in the bill. The water rates specified in this tariff (except for measured water) were graduated in a table according to the width and number of stories of the houses, and were made payable annually in advance on 1 May in each year, with a penalty of three percent if not paid by the 1 July and interest at the rate of seven percent from the 20th of December. The regulations extend to many details, making provision for extra charges to certain kinds of establishments, providing penalties for misuse of the water, etc. The city authorities answered the bill, admitting that they had assessed upon the mortgaged premises the water rents set forth in the bill, and alleged that they were imposed in pursuance of an act of the Legislature of New Jersey entitled \\"An act to authorize the construction of works for the supplying of Jersey City and places adjacent with pure and wholesome water,\\" approved March 25, 1852, and an act entitled \\"An act to reorganize the local government of Jersey City,\\" passed March 31, 1871, and the supplements thereto, and insisted that said water rents were a lien prior to the mortgages, and prayed that it might be so adjudged. The other defendants made no defense. The complainant and the city authorities entered into a stipulation to the effect that the allegations of fact in the bill were to be taken as true; that in the assessment of the water rents, interest, and penalties, all the requirements of the act \\"to reorganize the local government of Jersey City,\\" passed March 31, 1871, and the supplements thereto, had been complied with, and that the only question to be determined by the court was whether, upon the facts stated in the bill, the water rents and interest and penalties mentioned therein, or any of them, were liens upon the property in question prior to the lien of the complainant's mortgages. The chancellor decided that the giving of a priority of lien to the water rents over the mortgages pursuant to the statutes did not deprive the complainant of its property without due process of law and did not otherwise conflict with the Constitution of the United States or with that of New Jersey, and he decreed that for the purpose of raising the money due on the mortgages, the mortgaged premises must be sold subject to such lien, and that the bill must be dismissed as against the city. This decree, being appealed from, was affirmed by the New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals and the record was remanded to the Court of Chancery. The case is brought here by writ of error, and the errors assigned resolve themselves into the single error of sustaining the priority of the lien of the water rents over that of the complainant's mortgages. The court found that it was not necessary to enter into the discussions that have occupied the state courts. The court assumed that the rents, penalties, and interest claimed by the city have been imposed and incurred in conformity with the laws and constitution of the state, and that, by virtue of said laws and constitution, they are a lien on the property mortgaged to the complainant prior to that of its mortgages, and, this being so, we are only concerned to inquire whether those laws thus interpreted are or are not repugnant to the Constitution of the United States. The only clause of the Constitution supposed to be violated is that portion of the Fourteenth Amendment which declares that no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. It is contended that the mortgages created in 1863 and 1869, there being then no valid water rents due on the lot mortgaged, invested the complainant with the first lien thereon, and that that lien is property, and that the statutes of 1852 and 1871, by giving a superior lien to water rents afterwards accused, deprive it of its said property without due process of law. What may be the effect of those statutes in this regard upon mortgages which were created prior to the statute of 1852 it is unnecessary at present to inquire. The mortgages of the complainant were not created prior to that statute, but long subsequent thereto. When the complainant took its mortgages, it knew what the law was. It knew that by the law, if the mortgaged lot should be supplied with Passaic water by the city authorities, the rent of that water, as regulated and exacted by them, would be a first lien on the lot. It chose to take its mortgages subject to this law, and it is idle to contend that a postponement of its lien to that of the water rents, whether after accruing or not, is a deprivation of its property without due process of law. Its own voluntary act, its own consent, is an element in the transaction. The cases referred to by counsel to the contrary, holding void a consent exacted contrary to the Constitution, have no bearing on these cases. It may, however, be contended (though it is not by the counsel in this case) that the revised charter of 1871 introduced new impositions additional to the mere water rent, such as authorizing a penalty to be imposed by the Board of Public Works, if payment of the water rents were not made by a certain time, and a heavy rate of interest on rents continuing in arrear. But we look upon these provisions as merely intended to enforce prompt payment and as incidental regulations appropriate to the subject. The law which authorized these coercive measures gave to mortgagees and judgment creditors the right to pay the rents and to have the benefit of the lien thereof, so that it was in their own power to protect themselves from any such penalties and accumulations of interest. They are analogous to the costs incurred in the foreclosure of the first mortgage, which have the same priority as the mortgage itself over subsequent encumbrances. The decree of the New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals was affirmed.

He served his internship and residency at Marine hospitals in Norfolk Virginia and Mobile Alabama, before completing a two-year residence in neurology at Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans. In 1954 after he settled in Olney, Maryland he specialized in the treatment of handicapped and seriously injured patients whilst conducting part-time chemistry research at Ciba Pharmaceuticals in Summit, N.J. He became an enthusiastic weightlifter who pumped iron at the York Barbell Club, which was at the center of American fitness training thanks to its owner Bob Hoffman. Hoffman had competed with Joe Weider and Charles Atlas for the title of Mr America and wrote the book Weight Lifting in 1939. Ziegler's scientific credentials supplemented Hoffman's bodybuilding theories. Ziegler befriended weightlifter and bodybuilder champion John Grimek who was employed by Hoffman. Developing anabolic steroids In October 1954, Ziegler, went to Vienna with the American weightlifting team. There he met a Russian physicist who, over \\"a few drinks\\", repeatedly asked \\"What are you giving your boys?\\" When Ziegler returned the question, the Russian said that his own athletes were being given testosterone. Returning to America, Ziegler tried weak doses of testosterone on himself, on the American trainer Bob Hoffman and on three lifters, John Grimek, Jim Park and Yaz Kuzahara. All gained more weight and strength than any training programme would produce, but there were side- effects.Laure, P.: Les r√©presentations du dopage; approche psycho- sociologique, Th√®se STAPS, Nancy, France, 1994 With the research assistance of Ciba Pharmaceuticals, Ziegler began to look for synthetic substance that would mimic testosterone. Working at CIBA allowed Ziegler access to books and records from Germany where experiments with testosterone had been carried out by the Nazis, and which had been confiscated by the United States after the war.Frank Fitzpatrick, \\"Where steroids were all the rage\\", Philadelphia Inquirer, 2002 Ziegler sought a drug without after-effects and hit on an anabolic steroid, methandrostenolone (Dianabol, DBOL), made in the U.S. in 1958 by Ciba. Ziegler gave Dianabol to the entire U.S. Olympic weightlifting team in Rome in 1960, but they still lost to the Soviets. He gave up experimentation with athletes when he learned that some who had taken 20 times the recommended dose of Dianabol had developed a liver condition. He was quoted in Science in 1972 saying \\"I lost interest in fooling with IQ's of that caliber. Now it's about as widespread among these idiots as marijuana.\\"Wade, N., 1972. Anabolic steroids: doctors denounce them, but athletes aren‚Äôt listening. Science 176, 1399‚Äì1403. In later years Ziegler regretted introducing AAS to athletes.

The existing property was built as a family retreat, not as a cattle ranch, in a rustic style of construction using logs and board-and- batten techniques. The historic district includes seven cabins, a lodge, barn corral and smaller buildings on the west bank of the Snake River north of Moose, Wyoming. The property was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. History The ranch was first improved by Philadelphian Bryant Mears in 1914, building two log cabins, a small barn, corrals, fencing, a well and a ditch. Mears lived on the property, which he called the Sun Star Ranch, during the winter of 1915, and in 1916 he raised oats, barley and hay. The following year he married, then left to join the Army from 1917 to 1919. In 1927 the ranch was sold by Edward Mears to William Frew. Frew was a wealthy dude from Pittsburgh, who renamed the ranch the 4 Lazy F for the \\"Four Lazy Frews\\". The family allowed paying guests by invitation only, operating the ranch as both a family retreat and a dude ranch. The Frew family's life lease was surrendered in 2006, and the National Park Service took over the property, making repairs in 2010. In 2016 the property was recommended for use as housing for seasonal park employees. Description The ranch consists of seven cabins, a lodge-dining hall and a laundry-utility building, as well as a barn, garages, sheds and a corral. The ranch is sited on the west bank of the Snake River. All buildings are in the style known as \\"dude ranch vernacular\\", characterized by log construction and board-and-batten infill. Logs are generally varnished brown, but roofs are red or green asphalt roll roofing. Cabins are largely original construction with newer toilet additions to the rear. Interiors are intact with exposed logs in the walls and floors. The property was an inholding in Grand Teton National Park until 2006. It was sold as a life estate by Emily Frew Oliver to the National Park Service and has reverted to full National Park Service control.Kaiser, Harvey (1997). \\"Landmarks in the Landscape\\", San Francisco: Chronicle Books , p. 160 The 4 Lazy F was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 23, 1990.

He oversaw the construction of many important buildings in Kuala Lumpur, and he reorganised and expanded the railway system in the Federated Malay States. Early life C. E. Spooner was born on 22 November 1853 at Hafod Tan y Craig, North Wales, the youngest son of Charles Easton Spooner. He received his education in Engineering at Trinity College, Dublin, and became the resident engineer of the North Wales Narrow Gauge Railways from 1874 to 1876 at the time of its construction. Career Sultan Abdul Samad Building, designed under C. E. Spooner's instructions Spooner joined the Survey Department of Ceylon in 1876, and in the following year moved to the Ceylon Public Works Department where he stayed for 14 years. He was involved in many irrigation schemes and the construction of many important roads and other works in Ceylon. In 1891, he was appointed State Engineer of the Selangor Public Works Department (PWD). During his time at the Selangor PWD, he had a major impact on the architectural landscape of Kuala Lumpur, as he was responsible for directing and advising the architects who designed many of the best known buildings of the city. He first proposed the construction of a building that would house the offices of the colonial government (later known as Sultan Abdul Samad Building), and was responsible for the construction of many other important colonial buildings of the period. He carried out a massive building programme; other buildings constructed under his direction included the Old Post Office, Town Hall, the High Court, Pudu Prison, and others. He was also responsible for many large public works, such as the construction of an 83-mile trunk road into Pahang, part of which traversed the mountains at a height of 2,700 feet. Kuala Lumpur Railway Station In 1901, Spooner became General Manager of the Federated Malay States Railways. Under his guidance the state railway system was amalgamated, and the F.M.S Central Railways Offices in Kuala Lumpur (currently National Textile Museum) was completed. He also initiated the construction of Kuala Lumpur Railway Station. The amalgamation of the state railways was completed on 5 August 1903 by the establishment of inter-State connections. He also started the construction of the Johore State Railway, which would form the final link in the West Coast Line that connects Singapore with Penang. He was awarded the CMG in 1904. Spooner died in Kuala Lumpur on 14 May 1909. Significance Apart from his work in engineering and railways, Spooner was responsible for the creation of many buildings in Malaysia in a style of architecture that has been variously described as Indo-Saracenic, Neo-Mughal or Moorish, but which Spooner himself described as \\"Mahometan\\" (Islamic). The first building created in such a style under his instruction is the Sultan Abdul Samad Building. This kind of Indian- style Islamic architecture, which Spooner might have become familiar with when he was working in Ceylon, was previously not found in Malaya. Spooner however thought the style appropriate for the country. His preference then became the style for many important buildings constructed during his tenure at the PWD and FMS Railways, many of them designed by Arthur Benison Hubback. These buildings have since become an important part of the architectural heritage of Malaysia.

Parr (September 16, 1930 ‚Äì October 9, 2015) was a United States Secret Service agent who is best known for his notable act of bravery while defending President Reagan during the assassination attempt on Reagan's life on March 30, 1981 in Washington, D.C.. During the assassination attempt, Parr pushed the President into the presidential limousine, and made the critical decision to divert the presidential motorcade to George Washington University Hospital instead of returning to the White House. Parr was honored with U.S. Congress commendations for his actions that day and is widely credited with helping to save the President's life.Wilber, Del Quentin (2011). Rawhide Down: The Near Assassination of Ronald Reagan. Macmillan. . Parr died in 2015 from heart failure.[92] Early life Parr was born in Montgomery, Alabama on September 16, 1930, and he grew up in the Miami area. Parr received his B.A. in English and Philosophy from Vanderbilt University in 1962. In 1987, he received his M.S. in pastoral counseling from Loyola University in Maryland. An ordained minister, in 1987, Parr was awarded an honorary doctorate in Humane Letters from Eureka College. Career with the Secret Service Parr's interest in joining the Secret Service originated as a boy after watching Code of the Secret Service (1939) starring Ronald Reagan as agent \\"Brass\\" Bancroft. He was working as a lineman for Florida Power and Light in 1962 when he was interviewed by a visiting recruiter for the Secret Service. When asked if he was able to assume the risks of the job, Parr replied it was probably no more dangerous than what he had been doing for the power company. He joined the Secret Service at age 32, the oldest rookie in his class. His first protection assignment was John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson at the funeral of Eleanor Roosevelt. After Kennedy was assassinated, Parr was assigned to protect Marina Oswald, and Marguerite Oswald, the widow, and the mother, respectively, of Lee Harvey Oswald until completion of Marina's testimony before the Warren Commission. Over the next 23 years, Parr conducted 15 foreign and 65 domestic protective surveys for various Presidents and Vice Presidents, and worked with security, intelligence and law enforcement professionals in all 50 states and in 37 countries. From 1969-78, he worked for the Foreign Dignitary Division as a mid-level supervisor on the Humphrey, Agnew and Ford details, and directed security for 56 foreign heads of state, including Queen Elizabeth II of Britain, Emperor Hirohito of Japan, King Juan Carlos of Spain and Pope John Paul II. From 1978-1979, he was Special Agent in Charge of the Vice Presidential Protective Division, where he directed security for Vice President Mondale. In 1979, Parr moved to the Presidential Protective Division, where he was Special Agent in Charge and Head of the White House Detail. There, he directed security for Presidents Carter and Reagan. In 1982, he became Assistant Director of Protective Research, and in 1985, Parr retired from the Secret Service. Parr's story is told in his autobiography, In the Secret Service: The True Story Of The Man who Saved President Reagan (Tyndale House Publishing), co-authored by his wife Carolyn Parr. Assassination attempt US President Ronald Reagan waves just before he is shot outside a Washington hotel on March 30, 1981. From left are an unidentified man in a business suit; Parr, in raincoat, who pushed Reagan into the limousine; press secretary James Brady, who was seriously wounded; Reagan; Michael Deaver, Reagan's aide; unidentified policeman; Washington policeman Thomas K. Delahanty, who was shot; and secret service agent Tim McCarthy, who was shot in the stomach. On March 30, 1981, John Hinckley Jr. opened fire on President Ronald Reagan as he exited the Washington Hilton Hotel after giving a speech, firing six bullets in 1.7 seconds. Parr quickly pushed Reagan into the limousine, and as a result, one of the bullets overshot the president. Parr's prompt reaction had saved Reagan from being hit in the head.[13]:224 The final bullet ricocheted off the armored side of the limousine and hit the president in the left underarm, grazing a rib and lodging in his lung, causing it to partially collapse, and stopping less than an inch (25 mm) from his heart.[32][17][20] Carolyn, Parr's wife, had been standing directly across the street when the shooting occurred. Parr had called to invite her to come watch the president's exit and get a fun glimpse of her husband in action.[13]:164 After the Secret Service first announced \\"shots fired\\" over its radio network at 2:27 p.m., Reagan‚Äîcodename \\"Rawhide\\"‚Äîwas taken away by the agents in the limousine (\\"Stagecoach\\").[36][13]:66 At first, no one knew that he had been shot, and Parr stated that \\"Rawhide is OK...we're going to Crown\\" (the White House), as he preferred its medical facilities to an unsecured hospital.[37][36] Reagan was in great pain from the bullet that struck his rib, and he believed that the rib had cracked when Parr pushed him into the limousine. When the agent checked him for gunshot wounds, however, Reagan coughed up bright, frothy blood.[32] Although the president believed that he had cut his lip,[37] Parr believed that the cracked rib had punctured Reagan's lung and ordered the motorcade to divert to nearby George Washington University Hospital, which the Secret Service periodically inspected for use.[23] Although Reagan came close to death, the medical team's quick action‚Äîand Parr's decision to drive to the hospital instead of the White House‚Äîlikely saved the president's life.[32] After the assassination attempt, Jerry Parr was hailed as a hero and received Congressional commendations for his actions, and was named one of four \\"Top Cops\\" in the U.S. by Parade magazine. He later wrote about the assassination attempt in his autobiography, calling it both the best and the worst day of his life. Parr came to believe that God had directed his life so that he could one day save the president's life, and became a pastor after retiring from the Secret Service in 1985.[13]:224 Community service Parr was very active in his church in Washington, D.C., where he was a former co-pastor, retreat leader and spiritual director. He served on the Board of Directors at Joseph's House, an organization for men with AIDS and co-founded Servant Leadership School. In April 1992, he drove a school bus more than 3,000 miles from Washington, D.C. to deliver supplies to an orphanage in San Salvador. Death Parr died of congestive heart failure at a hospice in Washington, D.C. on October 9, 2015, aged 85. He was survived by Carolyn, his wife of nearly 56 years, three daughters and four granddaughters.

It consists of four 355 MVA (250 MW) back-to-back converter blocks, the first three of which were completed in the early 1980s Compendium of HVDC schemes, CIGR√â Technical Brochure No. 003, 1987, pp129-134. and the last in January 2001.

Much of the original converter equipment has been refurbished or modernised. History Electricity transmission from the 330 kV Russian (then the Soviet Union) system to the 400 kV Finnish system started in 1981. As the Russian and Finnish power systems are asynchronous, a direct AC connection was not possible and a HVDC-back-to-back station was needed. It was decided to build the substation near Vyborg in the Leningrad region. The first unit of the substation was commissioned in December 1981 followed by the second unit in the autumn 1982 and the third unit in the summer 1984. The system was manufactured by the Ministry for Electrotechnical Industry of the USSR. A fourth unit was added in 2001 and the control and protection equipment of the three original poles has subsequently been modernised.

Technical description The Vyborg substation is located east of Vyborg at . It is connected with the Russian and Finnish high-voltage power systems. The substation is connected to the Russian power system with two 330 kV lines to Vostochnaya substation and with one line to Kamenogorskaya substation. It is connected with Finland with three 400 kV cross-border connections to Yllikk√§l√§ (two lines) and Kymi (one line) substations. The substation consist of four independent, parallel symmetrical monopole (centre-grounded) back-to-back units, each rated 355 MVA and operating with a voltage of ¬± 85 kV. In contrast to most other HVDC plants, its converters do not allow bidirectional energy to transfer, but only from Russia to the power grid of Finland. Each pole consists of a single Twelve-pulse bridge at each end and was built using thyristors from the outset. The first three poles were originally built using small (60mm) diameter thyristors with three in parallel at each level, but these were later replaced by larger 80mm thyristors which did not require parallel connection.

The converter transformers are of the relatively unusual single-phase, four-winding arrangement, with a 38.5 kV filter winding on which the tuned filters are connected. Other high-pass filters are connected directly to the 330 kV or 400 kV AC busbars. With a total transmission rating of 1000 MW, Vyborg was the world's largest HVDC- back-to-back facility until the 1800 MW Al-Fadhili facility was completed in Saudi Arabia in 2009.Barrett,B.T., MacLeod,N.M, Sud,S., Al-Mohiasen, A.I., Al- Nasser,R.S., Planning and design of the AL FADHILI 1800 MW HVDC inter- connector in Saudi Arabia, CIGR√â session, Paris, 2008, paper reference B4-113. It is also the only back-to-back HVDC system in Russia and the only fully operational HVDC system in Russia, the others having either been shut down (Moscow‚ÄìKashira), never completed (Ekibastuz‚ÄìTambov) or are operated only at reduced capacity (Volgograd‚ÄìDonbass).

In 1795 he was appointed professor of anatomy and surgery, holding a chair of Istituzioni Chirurgiche at University of Pavia. He contracted syphilis after cutting himself during an autopsy. Monteggia's grave at the Monumental Cemetery of Milan, Italy Monteggia was second to describe the Monteggia fracture, a fracture of the proximal third of the ulna with the dislocation of the head of radius. Monteggia was first to describe Peroneal Tendon Subluxation, when he diagnosed this injury in a ballet dancer in 1803. It is when you have subluxation/dislocation of the peroneal tendons about the lateral malleolus.

As a one-dimensional representation over a ring R, its representation space is generally denoted by R(1) (that is, it is a representation ). p-adic cyclotomic character If p is a prime, and G is the absolute Galois group of the rational numbers, the p-adic cyclotomic character is a group homomorphism :\\\\chi_p:G\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathbf{Z}_p^\\\\times where Zp√ó is the group of units of the ring of p-adic integers. This homomorphism is defined as follows. Let Œ∂n be a primitive pn root of unity. Every pn root of unity is a power of Œ∂n uniquely defined as an element of the ring of integers modulo pn. Primitive roots of unity correspond to the invertible elements, i.e. to (Z/pn)√ó. An element g of the Galois group G sends Œ∂n to another primitive pn root of unity :\\\\theta=\\\\zeta_n^{a_{g,n}} where ag,n ‚àà (Z/pn)√ó. For a given g, as n varies, the ag,n form a compatible system in the sense that they give an element of the inverse limit of the (Z/pn)√ó, which is Zp√ó. Therefore, the p-adic cyclotomic character sends g to the system (ag,n)n, thus encoding the action of g on all p-power roots of unity. In fact, \\\\chi_p is a continuous homomorphism (where the topology on G is the Krull topology, and that on Zp√ó is the p-adic topology). As a compatible system of ‚Ñì-adic representations By varying ‚Ñì over all prime numbers, a compatible system of ‚Ñì-adic representations is obtained from the ‚Ñì-adic cyclotomic characters (when considering compatible systems of representations, the standard terminology is to use the symbol ‚Ñì to denote a prime instead of p). That is to say, œá = { œá‚Ñì }‚Ñì is a \\"family\\" of ‚Ñì-adic representations :\\\\chi_\\\\ell:G_\\\\mathbf{Q}\\\\rightarrow\\\\operatorname{GL}_1(\\\\mathbf{Z}_\\\\ell) satisfying certain compatibilities between different primes. In fact, the œá‚Ñì form a strictly compatible system of ‚Ñì-adic representations. Geometric realizations The p-adic cyclotomic character is the p-adic Tate module of the multiplicative group scheme Gm,Q over Q. As such, its representation space can be viewed as the inverse limit of the groups of pnth roots of unity in . In terms of cohomology, the p-adic cyclotomic character is the dual of the first p-adic √©tale cohomology group of Gm. It can also be found in the √©tale cohomology of a projective variety, namely the projective line: it is the dual of H2√©t( P1 ). In terms of motives, the p-adic cyclotomic character is the p-adic realization of the Tate motive Z(1). As a Grothendieck motive, the Tate motive is the dual of H2( P1 ).Section 3 of Properties The p-adic cyclotomic character satisfies several nice properties. *It is unramified at all primes ‚Ñì ‚â† p (i.e. the inertia subgroup at ‚Ñì acts trivially). *If Frob‚Ñì is a Frobenius element for ‚Ñì ‚â† p, then œáp(Frob‚Ñì) = ‚Ñì *It is crystalline at p.

Joe magazine was one in a number of popular publications aimed at the new urban middle and lower-middle classes. What set Joe magazine apart was its subversive use of humour, as well as its use of art and fiction as a narrative frame for cultural, social and political analysis. This strategy was seminal not only in educating and activating its readers but also in providing a platform for new fiction writers and artists to develop their talents. Founded by writer/publisher Hillary Ng'weno and artist Terry Hirst, Joe magazine published regularly between 1973 and 1979. The magazine was named after \\"Joe\\", a common man who used humour to deal with and expose the realities of urban life in contemporary Africa. This epitomized Joe magazine's aim; readers were encouraged to do the same, and enter into a dialogue with the character, and thus the magazine. Hirst described Joe as \\"a survivor who has to laugh to keep from crying.\\" Taking its cue from Drum, Joe magazine employed street-wise language in comic strips, fiction stories and thematic columns to explore everyday problems of the urban population. Its letters column, \\"Dear Joe\\", like Drum's \\"Speak up Man\\", encouraged interaction from readers. The magazine also carried an original short story in every issue, nurturing writers such as Sam Kahiga and Meja Mwangi, and even Ng≈©gƒ© wa Thiong'o, who occasionally contributed to the magazine. Joe's main distinguishing factor was its use of graphics, drawings, illustrated jokes and comic strips, such as \\"City Life\\" by Edward Gitau, \\"O.K, Sue! A City-Girl's View\\" by Kimani Gathingiri and Terry Hirst's \\"Daddy Wasiwasi & Co\\" and \\"The Good, the Bed and the Ugali\\", all of which created a lasting impression on Kenya's visual culture. Ng'weno left Joe magazine in 1974 and in 1979 Hirst renamed the magazine Joe Homestead, increasing the number of comic strips and adding a new section on family, nutrition and health - perhaps to take Joe magazine from its original urban setting to a more rural one. However, the new title did not attract advertisers and the magazine shut down in August 1979.

The Iron Steamboat Company (1881-1932) provided ferry service between Manhattan and Coney Island in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The original fleet consisted of seven iron-hulled steamboats, each named after a constellation--the Cygnus, the Cepheus, the Cetus, the Pegasus, the Perseus, the Sirius and the Taurus. In later years two older wooden steamboats, the Columbia and the Grand Republic would also be added. Each boat was powered by a single cylinder vertical beam steam engine and was divided into three decks and twelve watertight compartments. Service began in May 1881 and continued until the close of the 1932 season. Initially the line serviced only Coney Island, but over the years service was expanded to Long Branch, New Jersey, Rockaway Beach, New York, and for a brief time Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. Boats left Manhattan (half-hourly during summer) from various piers along the west side and Pier One in Lower Manhattan. In Coney Island ships landed at the New and Old Iron Piers,Coney Island transport and later at the amusement parks Dreamland and Steeplechase Park, where a round trip Iron Steamboat ticket bought free admission to the parks. The company also ran a daily service up the Hudson to Oscawana Island north of Croton-on-Hudson, NY where it operated a small hotel built over a railroad tunnel.

Upon completion of the course students may take the associated AP exam. The fee for each AP Exam is $91 (2014). The school normally retains $9 of that fee as a rebate to help with administrative costs. In 2012, the fee was $89 per test per pupil. Students have the option of taking College Board approved courses and then taking the College Board's examination in the Spring. Students, who achieve a 3 or better on the exam, may be awarded college credits at US universities and colleges. Each higher education institution sets its own standards about what level of credits are awarded to a student based on their AP exam score. Most higher education give credits for scores of 4 or 5. Some schools also give credits for scores of 3. High schools give credits towards graduation to students who take the school's AP class. At Dallas High School 79% of the students who took an AP course earned a 3 or better on the exam in 2016.PDE, School Performance Profile - Academic Performance Data - Dallas High School, October 2016 Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006-2009. Dallas high School applied for funding in 2006-07, but was denied by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. In 2007-08, it received $263,298. The high school received $47,989 in 2008-09 for a total funding of $311,287. School safety and bullying The Dallas High School administration reported there were zero incidents of bullying in the School in 2015. Additionally, there were no weapons incidents and no sexual incidents involving students. The local law enforcement was involved in zero incidents at the schools. Each year the school safety data is reported by the district to the Safe School Center which then publishes the compiled reports online. Nationally, nearly 20% of pupils report being bullied at school. The Dallas School Board has provided the district's antibully policy online. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the District must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. According to the Center for Disease Control‚Äôs biannual national study of high school students in 2009, five percent of Pennsylvania students did not go to school for at least one day because they felt unsafe at school or on their way to or from school. Education standards relating to student safety and anti harassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. School Resource Officer and Police Officer grant In 2014, Pennsylvania began a grant program providing funding for programs to address school violence and security. Eligible schools and municipalities could apply for up to $60,000 for a school resource officer and up to $40,000 for a school police officer. Dallas School District applied and was awarded $58,000.Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2013-14 School Resource Office/School Police Officer Grant Awardees, 2014 Safe School grant In 2013 and 2014, Dallas School District did not participate in a state Safe Schools Targeted Grant. The maximum of $25,000 grants were awarded through a competitive application process. The funds must be used for research based interventions, like: peer mediation, staff training in managing behavioral issues and creating a positive school climate. Wellness policy Dallas School Board established a district wellness policy in 2006. The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" Most districts identified the superintendent and school foodservice director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation. The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. Dallas High School offers both a free school breakfast and a free or reduced-price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger- Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. The Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 mandates that Districts raise their full pay lunch prices every year until the price of non- subsidized lunches equals the amount the federal government reimburses schools for free meals. That subsidy in 2013-2014 was $2.93. In 2015, federal reimbursement rates were: $3.07 per meal for students who are income-eligible for free lunches and $2.67 for those who qualify for a reduced price. School lunch participation nationally dropped from 31.6 million students in 2012 to 30.4 million in 2014, according to the federal Department of Agriculture. Pennsylvania statistics show school lunch participation dropped by 86,950 students in the same two years, from 1,127,444 in 2012 to 1,040,494 in 2014. In 2014, President Barack Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. The United States Department of Agriculture requires that students take milk as their beverage at lunch. In accordance with this law, any student requesting water in place of milk with their lunch must present a written request, signed by a doctor, documenting the need for water instead of milk. Dallas High School provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. A nurse is available in the building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health‚Äôs extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. In 2016, the Pennsylvania Department of Health made available to each Pennsylvania high school the overdose antidote drug naloxone in a nasal spray. School nurses were also provided with educational materials and training developed by the National Association of School Nurses. The cost was covered by a grant from a private foundation. Extracurriculars The Dallas School District offers a wide variety of clubs, activities and an extensive, publicly funded sports program. Eligibility for participation is determined by school board policy and in compliance with standards set by the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA). The PIAA mandates that student athletes must be passing at least four full-credit subjects to participate in sports. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students residing in the school district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, a Pennsylvania public cyber charter school, charter school and those who are homeschooled, are all eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools. According to PA Child Abuse Recognition and Reporting Act 126 of 2014, all volunteer coaches and all those who assist in student activities, must have criminal background checks. Like all school district employees, they must also attend an anti child abuse training once every three years.Eleanor Chute., New Pa. law expands clearance requirements for school volunteers, employees, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, December 15, 2014Ali Stevens., Child Protective Services Law impacts schools, WKOK.com 1070AM, January 6, 2015 Athletics Coaches receive compensation as outlined in the teachers' union contract. When athletic competition exceeds the regular season, additional compensation is paid.Dallas School Board, Dallas School District Teacher Union Contract, 2014 The District is noncompliant with state law, due to failing to post its Interscholastic Athletic Opportunities Disclosure Form on its website. Article XVI-C of the Public School Code requires the disclosure of interscholastic athletic opportunities for all public secondary school entities in Pennsylvania. All school entities with grades 7-12 are required to annually collect data concerning team and financial information for all male and female athletes beginning with the 2012-13 school year and submit the information to the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Beginning with the 2013-14 school year, all non-school (booster club and alumni) contributions and purchases must also be reported to PDE. According to Pennsylvania‚Äôs Safety in Youth Sports Act, all sports coaches, paid and volunteer, are required to annually complete the Concussion Management Certification Training and present the certification before coaching.

History and profile Souffles was established in 1966 by a small group of self-professed 'linguistic guerrillas' as \\"a manifesto for a new aesthetics in the Maghreb\\". The magazine became a conduit for a new generation of writers, artists, and intellectuals to stage a revolution against imperialist and colonial cultural domination.Issandr El Amrani, \\"In the Beginning There was Souffle\\", Bidoun.Toni Maraini, \\"Black Sun of Renewal\\", Red Thread, Issue 2 (2010). The starting point for this revolution was language. It was based in Rabat. From its first issue, Souffles posed an aggressive challenge to the traditional Francophone and Arabophone literary divides by encouraging experimentation, translations and collaborations. It was not long before its trademark cover emblazoned with an intense black sun radiated throughout Africa, the Arab world, West Indies and the Black Atlantic. In the early 1970s the magazine changed focus. Motivated by the crushing Arab defeat in the Six-Day War and the Paris uprisings, its founder, editor and publisher Abdellatif Laabi declared that \\"Literature was no longer sufficient\\". After the fifteenth issue, dedicated to Palestine, Souffles underwent a major redesign, emerging as a new firebrand organ of leftist revolutionary group, Ila al-Amam. This new political agenda caught the attention of the authorities and in 1972 the magazine was banned after publishing nearly 22 issues and Laabi arrested. While in prison he was awarded several international poetry prizes. After a long solidarity campaign, he regained his freedom in 1980.

The retailer sells savouries, sandwiches and bakery products across over 150 stores, from Fleetwood in Lancashire down to Wrexham in Wales. Sayers remained a family run business until 1977, when it was sold to United Biscuits, and again to Warburtons in July 1990. History Previous logo Sayers was established in 1912 by Fred and Lylian Sayer. Their first kitchen was based in a basement in Prescot Road, Old Swan, Liverpool and this then moved to a second shop in County Road, Walton in 1922. A larger bakery opened on Aintree Road in Bootle, in 1925. Then in 1931, a further expansion moved the business to a larger location in Lorenzo Drive, Norris Green. Sayers then remained a family business until 1977, when it was sold to United Biscuits. It was sold again to Warburtons in July 1990, a baking firm based in Bolton. Warburtons also bought Hampsons, Sayer's sister company and other bakeries in their estate included Burneys of Rochdale, Spinks of Sharston, Parkers of Eccles, Burtons of Blackpool. In May 1996, Warburtons then sold all its bakers stores to Lyndale Foods. Then in 1997, the brand was expanded further, when the Annes Shops chain of shops were bought from Roberts Bakery. In 2006, 183 jobs were lost at the site in Norris Green, Liverpool, with another two hundred jobs going in 2007. On 9 June 2008, parent company the Lyndale Group went into administration, and the site on Norris Green, Liverpool was closed immediately. In December 2019, Sayers entered administration, and was bought by Karen Wood, forming a new company, Sayers and Poundbakery Limited. Future Sayers is currently the biggest independent retail baker in the North West, and currently has over 150 shops and 25 caf√©s from Fleetwood in the north to Wrexham in the south, and Rhyl in the west to Halifax in the East. Some of its shops have now changed to a sister brand, Poundbakery, which sells similar products, but at a lower price.

Sunrun is responsible for installation, maintenance, monitoring and repairs. The company raised $12 million in venture capital funding from a group of investors including Foundation Capital in June 2008. In 2009, Sunrun closed a Series B round of funding for $18 million led by Accel Partners and joined by Foundation Capital. The company also received an additional commitment of $90 million in tax equity from U.S. Bancorp in 2009, following the $105 million in project financing from the bank in 2008.

It was based on the book of the same name by Kathleen Winsor. It also starred Richard Greene, George Sanders, Glenn Langan, Richard Haydn, and Jessica Tandy. The film was adapted by Jerome Cady, Philip Dunne and Ring Lardner Jr., and directed by Otto Preminger, who replaced original director John M. Stahl after 39 days of filming and $300,000 of production. The movie was originally budgeted at $4.5 million. The Hays Office had condemned the novel, but within a month of its publication the movie rights had been purchased by 20th Century Fox. The film on its release was initially condemned by the National Legion of Decency. In 1947, Darnell won the starring role in the highly anticipated film adaptation when the original star, newcomer Peggy Cummins, proved too inexperienced for the role. In the novel, the newborn Amber is so named by her dying mother after the color of her father's eyes. Publicity at the time compared the novel Forever Amber to Gone with the Wind. The search for the actress to portray Amber, a beauty who uses men to make her fortune in 17th-century England, was modeled on the extensive process that led to the casting of Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara. The film's score, by composer David Raksin, was nominated for the Oscar for Best Original Music Score. Plot On a dark night in 1644, during the English Civil War, a group of Roundheads pursue a Cavalier's carriage, which pauses to abandon a baby at a farmer's door. The roundheads kill everyone aboard. The farmer and his wife adopt the infant, whose blanket is embroidered ‚ÄúAmber‚Äù. The year 1660 brings the death of Oliver Cromwell and the Restoration of the Monarchy. Sixteen- year-old Amber (Linda Darnell) is a strong-willed beauty whose puritanical father has contracted her marriage to a farmer. Amber's dreams of an elegant life seem to come true with the arrival of a group of cavaliers and the handsome Bruce Carlton (Cornel Wilde): She is smitten. She begs Bruce to take her to London, but despite coaxing from his friend Almsbury (Richard Greene), he refuses. Before the men leave for town, Bruce and Amber share a kiss. Bruce and Almsbury are denied an audience with King Charles II. Back at their London tavern, Amber is waiting. Amber and Bruce begin an affair, He pampers her with new gowns and takes her to the theater. At one performance, Bruce approaches Barbara Villiers (Natalie Draper), the king's mistress, asking her to persuade Charles to grant him ships for his privateer mission. Amber tries to interfere: Distraught at the thought of Bruce leaving, she stops Almsbury from warning Bruce that the king has arrived. Charles later summons Bruce to court. Not wanting his friend to face the king's wrath alone, Almsbury goes with him. However, Charles grants Bruce's requests and sends him to Bristol that very night. At the tavern, Amber is sleeping. The next morning, she wakes to find Almsbury packing to return to Almsbury Hall: The king has restored his ancestral lands. Bruce's room is empty. Almsbury tells Amber to go home, but she refuses: She will rise in station and marry Bruce, no matter what. Almsbury gives her money, from Bruce, but she is soon conned and lands in Newgate, where she discovers that she is carrying Bruce's child. Black Jack Mallet, a highwayman, falls in love with her and helps her escape. They go to Mother Redcap's (Anne Revere) tavern, where Amber gives birth to a son. Amber lures fops into alleyways where Black Jack robs them. When Black Jack is killed by the king's guard, Amber flees and is discovered by Captain Rex Morgan (Glenn Langan). Captain Morgan takes her as his mistress. While Amber is working as an actress, the Earl of Radcliffe takes an interest in her. Almsbury, now married, comes to London and tells Amber that Bruce will return soon. Captain Morgan proposes, but she rejects him. She still loves Bruce. She also turns down a chance to dine with the king. Bruce returns, and Amber introduces him to their son, hoping he will want to settle down. It does not work. Morgan finds Bruce and Amber together and challenges Bruce to a duel, saying that Amber is his fianc√©e. Bruce tries and fails to persuade Morgan to withdraw the challenge. Bruce kills him and, blaming Amber, leaves England. Amber marries the elderly Earl of Radcliffe, thereby becoming a countess, Bruce's ship returns: He has the Black Plague. Amber saves his life by killing a nurse and lancing a boil on his chest. After Bruce discovers that Amber is married, he sails for Virginia. The Great Fire devastates London. Charles II plans to seduce Amber, but Radcliffe locks her in her room at home. While the fire rages in their house, Amber struggles with Radcliffe. A servant hits him and throws him into the fire, killing him. Amber becomes Charles' mistress. Bruce visits from Virginia with his wife, Corinna. He wants his son. Amber invites Corinna to dine with her and Charles, hoping that Charles will be attracted to a new face. Charles sees through the plot and allows Corinna to leave unmolested. Realizing that Amber still loves Bruce, Charles ends their relationship. Bruce asks Amber for custody of their son. Thinking he will choose her, Amber asks the boy to decide: He wants to go to Virginia. Bruce invites Amber to come with them, but she stays and watches, heartbroken, as Bruce takes her son away.

Macmillan, who had published Gone with the Wind, were excited about the book's commercial possibilities and launched it with an initial run of 175,000 copies. The New York Times called Winsor a \\"born storyteller\\". The same paper called the book \\"one of the most expertly packaged bundles of literature in years\\". It became a best seller. The book was banned in a number of countries including Australia. Development There was film interest in the book from the moment it reached the publisher. Winsor's agent suggested she not enter a competition MGM were running for novels because the agent felt they could get more than the prize money offered of $125,000. In November 1944, 20th Century Fox bought the screen rights for $200,000, one of the largest amounts paid for a novel. This money was contingent on Hays Office approval of a screen treatment of the book. (By way of comparison, Edna Ferber received $175,000 for Saratoga Trunk; MGM paid $125,000 for Green Dolphin Street and $200,000 to A. J. Cronin for The Green Years; Ernest Hemingway was paid $150,000 for For Whom the Bell Tolls).\\" Script The following month Winsor announced she had signed a contract with Fox to work on the script for the film, provide technical advice, and do a screen test. Jerome Cady was going to write the script and William Perlberg would produce. Cady finished the script by March. Eventually Philip Dunne did the script and John Stahl was assigned to direct. Dunne was one of the studio's top screenwriters and Stahl had just made the hugely popular Leave Her to Heaven for Fox. Dunne later called the novel \\"worthless\\" and believed in any adaptation \\"it would be foolish to try to recover the intent of the author which is to please that part of the public that likes to lick its lips while reading.\\"McGilligan p 167 The script had to make a number of changes to get past the censor. \\"We had to be more straight aced with Amber than we would with another picture\\", said Perlberg. \\"\\"Everyone is waiting for a chance to jump on us.\\" Amber's lovers were reduced from over 30 in the novel to five in the film. Winsor had little involvement in the script and the film in the end. Casting There was an extensive, well publicised talent search for the performer who would play the lead role along the lines of David O. Selznick's challenge to find an actress to cast as Scarlett O'Hara. In November 1944, Gene Tierney was reported as being the front runner. Maureen O'Hara who was a redhead and under contract to Fox, lobbied hard for the role, even wearing a period dress in the studio commissary. Paulette Goddard also wanted to do the part. Numerous actresses were tested. Perlberg said he was looking for \\"a young Vivien Leigh\\" or \\"an English Lana Turner.\\" Peggy Cummins, an English actor who had been on stage in Junior Miss, was (reportedly) the 37th tested and soon established herself as a favourite in October 1945. Annette Simmonds was also a front runner. Richard Green, a Fox contract player who had not worked in Hollywood since 1940 due to war service, was an early favourite for the role of Bruce Carlton. James Mason, then starring in the hugely popular The Seventh Veil, was offered the role but turned it down because he thought it was \\"a silly book\\" and the \\"script didn't improve it\\". The first actors announced for the film were Reginald Gardiner who was cast as Charles II by December 1945 and Glenn Langan who was cast by January 1946. In February 1946, Daryl Zanuck of Fox said the lead would be played by Peggy Cummins, with Cornel Wilde (a studio contract star) to play her main love interest. Wilde was, after Tyrone Power, the leading \\"swashbuckling\\" style star under contract to Fox at the time. Richard Greene was the other leading contender for the part, and Wilde was under suspension at Fox to a dispute over roles, but Zanuck decided on Wilde, and the suspension was lifted. Vincent Price was cast in a support role as Lord Almsbury, friend of Bruce Carleton. Original filming Filming started in March 1946. The budget was $3 million, making it the most expensive film in the history of Fox. (The previous had been Wilson.) The film was expected to take 103 days of filming and Cummins had to appear in every scene but one. Winsor was paid $85,000 when filming started. Cummins collapsed on set on March 30 due to illness. Filming was halted two times, reportedly due to illness on Cummins' part. Then on April 30, after 39 days of filming and $1 million had been spent, Fox announced that the shoot would be halted for three months and that Cummins and Stahl would be assigned to other projects. Zanuck, head of Fox, said the film \\"has failed to measure up to the standards planned.\\" The reason given later was that it was felt Cummins was very good as the young Amber ‚Äì she had been extensively tested for these scenes ‚Äì but looked too young to play Amber as she grew up. In the words of The New York Times \\"they found that Miss Cummins as grown up seductress looked more like Fluffy wearing her mother's old clothes and smearing on mom's lipstick when she wasn't looking.\\" Fox did not give up on Cummins and put her into The Late George Apley, Moss Rose and Escape. However, she would leave the studio after three years. Otto Preminger and Linda Darnell In June 1946, Fox announced that Otto Preminger would take over from Stahl as director, and that the film would resume production in September. Preminger said he would use the same script as Stahl (which the censor had approved). It was estimated that if none of the Stahl-Cummins footage could be used, it would cost the studio $300,000. Preminger said the film had been stopped because \\"somehow all the elements didn't jell\\". He later said in his memoirs that he did not want to make the film because he disliked the novel but Zanuck forced him under his contract.Preminger p 107 He supervised a rewrite of the script by Dunne and Ring Lardner Jr. Dunne later recalled he and Lardner \\"both had great distaste for the material... We divided it up because the steam was on... They wanted to get it restarted as soon as possible.\\"McGilligan p 157 In July, Linda Darnell was announced as Cummins' replacement. \\"I'm pinching myself\\", said Darnell. Preminger later said that he did not want Darnell, and would have preferred someone like Lana Turner who he felt could have been borrowed from MGM. However he says Zanuck wanted Darnell.Preminger p 108 Darnell's casting meant she had to miss out on a role in Captain from Castile; she was replaced by Jean Peters. By now the budget was up to $4.5 million. $2 million went on physical production. Because mostly contract actors were used, the cast only cost $350,000 (sets cost $380,000). There were other cast changes. Richard Greene (making his first Hollywood film in seven years) replaced Vincent Price. George Sanders replaced Reginald Gardiner as Charles II. John Russell, who the studio was grooming for stardom, was cast as Black Jack Russell. Wilde was reluctant to return to the film. Fox considered replacing him with Stewart Granger, though this would have been difficult due to Granger's other commitments. In October, right before filming was to resume, Wilde announced he would not return to the role unless he was given an increase in salary. He was being paid $3,000 a week for forty weeks a year but wanted an arrangement comparable to Betty Grable, who made two films a year at $150,000 a film. Wilde said \\"My agent said that since I am leading the whole Fox lot in fan mail I should be getting money comparable to that received by the top people at the studio. I am worth much more to the company than I was a year ago [when his contract was renegotiated] and an actor must insure himself against the time when he is no longer wanted.\\" The dispute was ended when the studio increased his salary to $5,000 a week. Second filming Filming resumed in October 1946 and ended in March 1947. The budget by the end was $6.5 million. George Sanders was filming a part in The Ghost and Mrs Muir at the same time. Release The film was completed and released in New York in October 1947. Opening week record The film played 451 dates in its first week and Fox claimed that it had achieved the biggest box-office opening figures in the entire industry.Motion Picture Herald, November 1, 1947, p 6 Variety (magazineVariety reported the opening receipts were by far the largest raised by one picture first week since they had been tabulating grosses across the country in 1946. In the 17 theatres they received reports from, they claimed it had grossed slightly better than $700,000. The film played with increased admission prices compared to most films ($1.20). It set a house record at the Roxy in New York ($180,589). In the following week, Varietys reporting had 27 theatres playing the movie which in total grossed close to $800,000 taking its gross to $1.5 million in two weeks. Catholic condemnation The film was condemned by Cardinal Francis Spellman and the Legion of Decency who threatened a boycott of Catholic theatregoers. Fox originally decided to fight the ban claiming the ruling was \\"harsh\\" and \\"unfair\\" considering all the effort they put in to get the movie past the censors. The studio changed its mind. A number of changes were made to the film, including adding a prologue which criticised Amber, saying, \\"the wages of sin is death\\" and adding an epilogue where Cornel Wilde says \\"may God have mercy on both of us for our sins.\\" The film was re-released in December 1947. Accolades The film is recognized by the American Film Institute in these lists: * 2005: AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores ‚Äì Nominated Proposed remake In 1986, there was speculation Raquel Welch was due to appear in a television miniseries version of the novel. However, the miniseries was never made.

The museum is located on Los Angeles‚Äô Museum Row on Wilshire Boulevard, and across from the George C. Page Museum and La Brea Tar Pits. It is the only institution on the West Coast of the United States to focus exclusively on craft. In addition to presenting exhibitions, Craft Contemporary is also well-known for its public programs catering to all ages, from family workshops to more intensive sessions for older adults. History Formerly known as Craft and Folk Art Museum (CAFAM), the museum was incorporated in 1973 and began formal operations in 1975. It is the successor to the commercial gallery, The Egg and The Eye, which opened November 1, 1965 in the same historic building. Like the present-day museum, the gallery showed contemporary craft objects and folk art. A popular restaurant on the mezzanine featured a long list of ethnically inspired omelettes. When the commercial gallery was converted to a private, nonprofit museum, the restaurant took the name of the former gallery, The Egg and The Eye. The restaurant closed forever, as part of a major renovation, on June 30, 1989. The renovated museum re-opened May 12, 1995, then closed temporarily at the end of 1997, and finally re-opened February 11, 1999. The building was originally designed by Gilbert Stanley Underwood in 1930 as a mixed-use commercial space. It was renovated twice for The Egg and The Eye by Guy Moore, and then extensively renovated by Hodgetts + Fung in 1995. The original facade remains almost completely intact. Edith R. Wyle In 1965, a group of women, led by artist Edith R. Wyle (grandmother of actor Noah Wyle), called the \\"Folk Art's High Priestess\\" by the LA Times, channeled their passion for indigenous art into The Egg and The Eye gallery. The gallery sold fine craft and traditional art from world cultures; the restaurant served over 50 varieties of omelettes. The success of this concept spurred the formation of the nonprofit Craft and Folk Art Museum (CAFAM) in 1973. When the gallery was converted to a museum, the restaurant took on the gallery's former name: The Egg and The Eye. From the beginning, CAFAM was a ‚Äúliving museum‚Äù offering artist-led workshops and educational programs. CAFAM held early shows for now- prominent artists, including Frank Romero, Otto Natzler, Dale Chihuly, and Sam Maloof. Edith Wyle was CAFAM's Artistic Director from 1973 - 1984, when she retired. At that point, she became a member of the Board of Trustees, and took the title of Founder/Director Emeritus. In 1976, CAFAM initiated Los Angeles‚Äô first multicultural festival, the International Festival of Masks. This two- day celebration of folk art, dance, music, and food drew up to 40,000 people through 1994. When Los Angeles hosted the Summer Olympics in July 1984, the Festival of Masks was chosen to be an official event of the Olympic Arts Festival; it was produced over a three-day weekend, July 20‚Äì22, 1984. After 24 years, the restaurant closed forever at the end of June 1989, when the museum had to move temporarily during renovations. The museum was in residence in the historic May Company department store from November 1989 through the end of 1992. Moving the offices and the library next door (at 5800 Wilshire) to its original building at 5814 Wilshire, CAFAM mounted exhibitions in various off- site venues and hired the architectural firm of Hodgetts + Fung to reconfigure the museum, reopening as a merged structure May 12, 1995. At the end of 1997, CAFAM closed due to financial difficulties; at the time, it was believed to have shut down for good. The permanent collection was sold at auction; the library was given to the L.A. County Museum of Art Research Library; and the institutional archives (staff files, 1965 - 1997) were given to UCLA Young Research Library Special Collections. However, Patrick Ela, who was CAFAM's Administrative Director from 1975 - 1984 and then Executive Director until his resignation in 1996, working with Al Nodal, the General Manager of the L.A. Department of Cultural Affairs, developed a partnership between the CAFAM Board and the City of L.A., which allowed the museum to reopen after 14 months in February 1999. The Founder of the museum, Edith Wyle, died October 12, 1999, and the following year the City of L.A. honored her with the placement of a commemorative plaque at the corner of Stanley Avenue and Wilshire Boulevard, proclaiming the intersection as \\"Edith Wyle Square.\\"  Today  In 2018, the museum's board of directors voted to change the name of the institution to Craft Contemporary, publicly announcing the decision in January 2019. According to an interview with Executive Director Suzanne Isken, the new name reflects the changing field of craft from \\"hav[ing] an association to something very old and very dusty\\" to a contemporary art form in its own right, rooted in the \\"now\\". The museum's vision of craft is one that is focused on the process and materials, and how these traditions \\"can be used in unprecedented ways, both in technique and concept.\\" Craft Contemporary, 2019.

Exhibitions  According to their mission statement, Craft Contemporary aims to exhibit \\"established and emerging artists and designers who are often underrepresented in larger art institutions.\\" Because of this emphasis, the museum is known for supporting the early career of important artists-- such as Betye Saar, Timothy Washington, Gronk, Beatriz Cortez, and John Riddle, to name a few-- before they reach mainstream recognition by larger art institutions. Notable past exhibitions include: * \\"Betye Saar: Keepin' it Clean\\" (2017) * Pacific Standard Time: \\"The US-Mexico Border: Place, Imagination, and Possibility\\" (2017) * 1st Clay Biennial, \\"Melting Point: Movements in Contemporary Clay\\" (2018) * \\"Katherine Gray: As Clear as the Experience\\" (2018) * \\"Sherin Guirguis: Of Thorns and Love\\" (2018) * \\"Merion Estes: Unnatural Disasters\\" (2018) * \\"Beatriz Cortez: Trinidad / Joy Station\\" (2019) * \\"The RIDDLE Effect\\" (2019) * \\"RAW: Craft, Commodity, and Capitalism\\" (2019) * \\"Finding the Center: Works by Echiko Ohira\\" (2019) * 2nd Clay Biennial, \\"The Body, The Object, The Other\\" (2020) References External links Edith R.

It, along with its many contemporaries, sought to ameliorate an intellectual climate which suffered from a dearth of commentary on African film. A corollary of the journal's efforts was to improve worldwide exposure and access to African films - it was linked to the Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou (FESPACO), the continent's leading film festival, from its inception. Ecrans d'Afrique has also been lauded for its wide gaze covering the whole of the African diaspora and for its excellent coverage of Caribbean film developments.

She currently resides in the United States, where she is a frequent invited speaker at museums and schools around the country. Biography Elly born in »òimleu Silvaniei, Romania to Eugene and Irina Berkovits. In 1944, her father was inducted by the invading Hungarian forces into a forced labor camp, where he perished on the Russian front. Elly and her remaining family, her mother and younger brother Adalbert, were taken to Cehei ghetto 'the day after Pesach' in 1944 along with most other Jews in SƒÉlaj County. Six weeks later, her family, along with thousands of other Jews were transported via cattle cars to Auschwitz concentration camp. She was separated from her mother and brother, and never saw either again. Elly credits her survival of the camp to 'miracles', noting that few others of her age group survived the ordeal. Elly was transferred to Fallersleben, a part of the Neuengamme concentration camp, where she performed slave labor for Volkswagen until she was liberated at Salzwedel by the Allies on April 14, 1945. Elly returned to her home town, where she soon married family friend Ernest Gross. They have two children and five grandchildren, who also reside in the United States. Elly graduated from LaGuardia Community College with an associate degree in Fine Arts in 1993 at the age of 64.

This individual ran a one-man publishing empire on the streets of Kinshasa. His arsenal of little comic books, written in Lingala, Tshiluba and French, were made on low-quality paper. These comic books were self-produced using stencils and photocopying machines and distributed informally in the market place. The comic books quickly gained notoriety for their controversial attacks against the political powers of the 1990s in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Along with other low-cost and locally distributed magazines, such as Fula Ngenge, Mfumu'eto's comics inaugurated the era of the author as the producer in the Democratic Republic of Congo's literary world. Like other comics produced in Kinshasa at the time they were heavily influenced by urban culture. Mfumu'Eto also drew inspiration from local traditions, combining African traditional medicine with religion, pulp fiction with politics,and irony with attitude. This culminated into an eclectic display that directly contested dominant colonial systems of knowledge. His most famous series includes the politically propulsive A Nguma Meli Muasi Ya Na Kati Kinshasa, first published in 1990 and which was subsequently banned by the authorities. Mfumu'Eto work was exhibited in Europe and the US in 2011, following the international success of popular painters such as Cheri Samba and the growing interest in African comics.

Directed by Mar√≠a Eugenia Rencoret, produced by Daniela Demichelli and written by Pablo Illanes and Nona Fern√°ndez. The telenovela marked a change in themes from earlier night time productions from the state channel, being that this time the main themes were not troubled couple relationships and sex, but this time the main theme was associated with a serial killer, who kills women by taking their hearts. The debut date was April 30, 2007, and the last episode took place on August 16 of the same year.  History  Santiago, 1992 Rodrigo Quintana, Piedad Est√©vez, Juli√°n Garc√≠a and Benjam√≠n Morand√© are inseparable friends. Idealistic in their planning of future projects, they study medicine and dream of working together to help the needy. Rodrigo (Francisco Melo) is the most charming and intelligent, and is the natural leader of the group. His personality wins over Piedad (Sigrid Alegr√≠a) with whom he shares an intense but tumultuous love, while Juli√°n (√Ålvaro Rudolphy) loves Piedad in silence. Rodrigo's drug and alcohol addiction result in the deterioration of his relationship with Piedad. He reaches a point where he disappears from his friends' lives, after a confusing incident that results in a dead body and in Piedad being hospitalized. Rodrigo Quintana leaves his friends and his studies to admit himself into a rehabilitation center outside of Chile. Piedad is never the same again. Santiago, 2007 Now, 15 years later, when Benjam√≠n, Juli√°n, and Piedad have forgotten about the past, Rodrigo returns to their lives. Partners in an ophthalmology practice, the three doctors find that Rodrigo Quintana's return from Europe continues to bother them. The friends have changed. Quintana opts for an austere lifestyle in a rural clinic, while his friends accumulate a small fortune operating on the eyes of high-society people. Rodrigo's return breaks Piedad's daily routine, who discovers that in spite of everything, Rodrigo is still the love of her life. Meanwhile, Juli√°n‚Äîdivorced for a year from Matilde (Alejandra Fosalba)‚Äîbecomes preoccupied with Piedad. It bothers Juli√°n that history could repeat itself, and that Rodrigo could finally succeed in taking away the woman Juli√°n's always loved but has never been able to have. But love is not the only thing that changes the lives of this group of friends. While they are all at a benefit event, they are witnesses to a crime. The victim, Mar√≠a Gracia Carpenter (Amparo Noguera), a well-known socialite, is the third murder that torments the city. Before her, the mysterious disappearance of Angela Argento (Mar√≠a Jos√© Le√≥n), a sophisticated executive, was very closely followed by the media and the police. They concluded that they were in the presence of a psychopath serial killer, whose victims were beautiful, independent, high-society women. All were killed using the same M.O., a deep and accurate cut to remove their hearts. The lead police detective Eva Zanetti (Paola Volpato) is in charge of the investigation. Everyone is a suspect. Slowly the circle of suspects is tightened, and the suspects are reined in. Only one is the killer, and with the passing of time the hour of the discovery of the killer's true identity draws closer.

Established through the merger of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada (IDA) and Market Regulation Services Inc. (RS) on June 1, 2008, IIROC oversees all investment dealers and trading activity on debt and equity markets in Canada. The organization sets regulatory and investment industry standards and has quasi-judicial powers in that it holds enforcement hearings and has the power to suspend, fine and expel members and registered representatives, such as advisors. However, it has often been criticized by investor advocates as ineffective. History IIROC was formed on June 1, 2008 through the merger of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada (IDA) and Market Regulation Services Inc. (RS). The Bond Dealers Section of the Toronto Board of Trade was formed in 1916 as a trade organization to coordinate financing of Canada's war effort. It was renamed the Investment Dealers Association of Canada in 1934. Throughout most of its history, the IDA serve both as a regulator and as an advocacy organization for the securities dealers. In 2006, IDA narrowed its focus to regulation and transferred its industry association role to a new separate and independent industry association, the Investment Industry Association of Canada. Market Regulation Services Inc. was formed in 2002 in response to the implementation of National Instruments 21-101 Marketplace Operation and 23-101 Trading Rules, which require an independent regulation services provider to regulate trading in all Canadian marketplaces, including the TSX. Management Andrew J. Kriegler was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer of IIROC on November 1, 2014.http://business.financialpost.com/2014/09/03/andrew-kriegler-iiroc/ Before joining IIROC, Kriegler was Deputy Superintendent at Canada's banking regulator, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, or OSFI, where he was responsible for supervising hundreds of federally regulated financial institutions. Kriegler succeeds Susan Wolburgh Jenah, who headed IIROC's predecessor, the Investment Dealers Association of Canada (IDA) before becoming IIROC's first President and CEO in 2008. At the IDA, she had taken over the post from Joe Oliver, who was alter elected as a Member of Parliament and went on to serve as federal Minister of Finance. Operations IIROC operates under Recognition Orders from the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), which is the umbrella for Canada's provincial and territorial securities regulators. IIROC is subject to CSA oversight and regular operational reviews. Regulatory failures =Loss of unencrypted private investor data= The CSA (Canadian Securities Administrators) investigated IIROC for the loss of personal financial data of thousands of brokerage clients after IIROC announced that it lost a mobile device containing the information. The device had not been encrypted, which is in violation of IIROC policy. The case reviewed IIROC's current policies, controls and procedures around information security. More than 50,000 Canadian brokerage clients, from 32 investment firms, had personal financial information on the device. At least one source has called the incident a cover up. =Charges against David Berry= IIROC charged David Berry with securities law violations that were used by Scotiabank as grounds for his dismissal. David Berry claims his dismissal and the reputation damage stemming from the IIROC charges have cost him $105M dollars. In a ruling on January 15, 2013, more than seven years after the initial accusation, a hearing panel of the IIROC dismissed all charges against Berry. =Charges against Blackmont Capital Inc. and Dean Shannon Duke= In September 2010, IIROC contended that a Vancouver brokerage firm, Blackmont Capital Inc., and an employee, Dean Shannon Duke, acted against two IIROC rules in agreeing to share trading commissions with a third party. In December 2010, IIROC imposed penalties on both Blackmont Capital and Duke for splitting commissions with people associated with a client without the client's written consent. IIROC also imposed penalties for not disclosing the commission-sharing arrangement with its clients. Blackmont Capital and Duke were assessed a total of $857,500 in fines by IIROC. In 2011, the British Columbia Securities Commission (BCSC) overturned IIROC's decision and penalties against Blackmont Capital and Duke. A BCSC appeal panel contended that Blackmont and Duke's act of not disclosing their commission-sharing arrangement was not against public interest. The BCSC reversed IIROC's verdict and the imposing of its fines. =Charges against Evergreen Securities CCO= An Oct. 2012 IIROC Hearing Panel dismissed all allegations made by IIROC against Evergreen Capital Partners Inc. executives Loretta Carbonelli and Gerald T.Conway. =Charges against Vic Alboini and Northern Securities Inc.= In 2012, IIROC contended that activist investor, Vic Alboini, and two other executives at Northern Securities Inc. had improperly obtained credit for Jaguar Financial Corporation and had risked Northern Securities as a result. IIROC penalized Alboini with a suspension of two years, a permanent ban from being an \\"ultimate designated person\\" and fines totaling $750,000. Northern Securities appealed IIROC's decision to the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC). The OSC overturned one count against Alboini and Northern Securities, namely that Alboini and Northern Securities had not corrected deficiencies found in IIROC compliance reviews. The OSC also overturned IIROC's penalties against Alboini and Northern Securities, saying that IIROC should not have announced serious penalties at the same time as their decision. =Charges against Carolann Steinhoff= IIROC imposed charges against broker, Carolann Steinhoff. Focusing on Steinhoff's activities between 2004 and 2007, IIROC contended that Steinhoff had instructed her assistants to falsify client documents and that she had obstructed IIROC investigations. Part of IIROC's contentions related to Steinhoff's instruction to her assistant to cut and paste a client's signature from an existing form to an unsigned guarantee. In 2011, the BCSC overturned IIROC's decision against Steinhoff. In overturning IRROC's decision, the BCSC stated that IIROC's ruling against Steinhoff was not supported by the objective evidence, but was made on the basis of character evidence. The BCSC panel also concluded that Steinhoff was entitled to defend herself and therefore overturned the charges against her for obstructing IIROC's investigation. =Jurisdiction over former members dispute= The organization has been involved in litigation over its power to discipline former members for their conduct while they were members. An Ontario Divisional Court decision in the matter of Stephen Taub ruled the Ontario Securities Act does not allow this. The British Columbia Court of Appeal reached a different conclusion in the matter of Charles Dass and upheld a decision of the British Columbia Securities Commission that IIROC does have jurisdiction over former members.Investment Dealers Association of Canada v. Dass, 2008 BCCA 413 Later the Ontario Court of Appeal reversed the Divisional Court decision and reached the same conclusion as the British Columbia Court.Taub v. Investment Dealers Association of Canada, 2009 ONCA 628 In Saskatchewan and Alberta, provincial securities regulations state explicitly that self-regulatory organizations have the power to pursue enforcement activities with regards to former members.
