She started her career in the early 2000s. She works primarily within the disciplines of performance and video art. Her works have been known to push the boundaries of ethics and morals within the context of human sexuality in order to ask the audience how they feel, and why stating, ‚ÄúI'm asking them to think about the piece itself rather than allowing the piece to become a spectacle.‚Äù As a professional dominatrix, she strives to reveal the different forms of sexuality apart from what is conventionally accepted. All her works are based on redefining sexuality and art, as publicly acknowledged by celebrity satirist Perez Hilton in stating on his confusion about Art, ‚ÄúWe're not really sure how this is art, but it's awesome!‚Äù She is based in Brooklyn, New York. Performance Her most notable performance is ‚ÄúBody As Commodity‚Äù performed at Art Basel Miami, at VECTOR Gallery, sponsored by Select Fair the Huffington Post made note of the irony with which the piece gained international viral attention, ‚ÄúHow artworks meant to call the unsavory aspects of culture into question often end up affirming them.‚Äù Proclaimed by VECTOR Gallerist JJ Brine to be a post human performance artist, she touches on post modernist concepts, ‚ÄúYes, I think the piece speaks to how people are finding out about it. And how people are finding out about is itself a commentary.\\"Her work has called into question where art begins, and where it ends as sex culture blog Fleshbot wrote: ‚ÄúMaybe I'm a part of this gigantic art installation now, and by extension, so is everyone reading this‚Ä¶‚Äù Despite the controversial Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content of the physical portion of this piece as she described it to Cool Hunting as, \\"It may or may not actually be about prostitution.\\" The work was billed as the top social post of Art Basel, with a majority of the posts focusing on musical artist Usher‚Äôs participation in her installation, as summed up by a review by ArtNet News, ‚ÄúUnfortunately for both the artist and the gallerist, as the Internet sees it, Usher is still the star of this tale.‚Äù Since Basel 2014 Marquise has collaborated with artists, JJ Brine, Zefrey Throwell, Adrian Buckmaster and Caspar Pet√©us in variety of mediums. Body as commodity Marquise sat without movement or emotion forcing the audience or participant to consider whether using a doll for sexual pleasure commodifies sex more or less immorally than using a real body for amenities that can be monetarily quantified, such as energy; the charging of a mobile phone. This performance uses the exchange of literal energy (battery life) for figurative energy (use of body) for money ($100/10min), to exemplify the exchange of simulated sexuality for monetary gain. The aim of this exchange is to challenge the audience, asking them to question how the social presentation of sexuality may be affecting their seemingly inherent moral standing. \\"Body As Commodity\\" was a live performance, documented with mobile phones by gallery and art fair attendees, and posted online; the photos taken spread virally over social media, reaching an apex within 48hrs of the performance, posted on conservative international YouTube channels, news publications and blogs. The performance which speaks on the objectification of a body, was objectified - being announced to the world as the 'woman's vagina which Usher used to charge his cell phone'. The global reaction has not only called into question 'what is Art?' but also, 'are we (the audience) now part of the art?' By inserting a sexually explicit construct into a socially acceptable context, the audience participant is liberated from societal ethics in order to better assess their personal moral stance on the use of a body for personal gain. The aim of this exchange was to challenge the audience, asking them to question how the social presentation of sexuality may be affecting their seemingly inherent moral standing. The participant is also forced to reflect on the ability of their desire to become a need, how great their need for energy can become at times of impending technological dissonance (such as a dying mobile phone), and how it can eclipse the social ethics instilled in them. Video As an actor, Marquise has owned and operated a number of artistic adult oriented content where she worked as director, producer, editor, and actor, Marquise set off to produce her own work, posting it under her new production company, including the infamous ‚ÄúSolo Ritual 1 (2011)‚Äù screened at the NYC Adult Film Festival in early 2015 alongside artists such as Zefrey Throwell, Narcissister, Richard Kern, and Miley Cyrus, and James Franco. In an interview with a German publication, she has revealed that ‚Äúshe wants the eroticism she creates to be more that just about arousal and entertainment, but the psychology of both as well.‚Äù Her work often covers the subjects of sex work and censorship, eliciting critical response for its controversial eroticism. Lena Marquise and JJ Brine previously collaborated on an erotic Satanic short film The Visitor written by Brine and performed by Marquise, wherein the biblical Mary, who is played by Marquise, masturbates with a knife while chanting patriarchal verses as a commentary on mass genital mutilation in Egypt. Photographic Maintaining a postmodernist approach to her work, Marquise recently released a new collection of prints she has created using text overlays paired with film stills she has produced, directed and acted in. Marquise and Caspar Pet√©us collaborated on a photographic series entitled ALCHEMY: The Process, which was premiered at Black Box Gallery in Brooklyn, New York and sold at Saatchi Art and Art Slant. Marquise and Peteus also previously collaborated on digital photographic works such as As Above So Below which was shown on Digital Sweat Gallery. Music Marquise creates musical scores to accompany her video works. She is also a member of the LaBiancas, a Charles Manson concept band, along with bandmate JJ Brine.

It aired on April 16, 2015 on ABC in the United States. The episode was written Austin Guzman and directed by David Greenspan (filmmaker). The episode features a plane crash in Seattle bringing patients to Grey Sloan Memorial and old memories of the season 8's tragic plane crash that claimed the lives of Mark Sloan (Eric Dane) and Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) back to Meredith Grey, Arizona Robbins, Derek Shepherd and Cristina Yang. Plot A plane crash in downtown Seattle brings a crop of new patients to Grey Sloan Memorial and old memories back to Meredith, Arizona, and Owen. Meredith tries to make it through the day without freaking out about not knowing where Derek is; Bailey gives her a 5:00 time frame for freaking out. No freaking out until 5:00 pm. Alex sticks close to Arizona to make sure that she's okay, but she finds him more annoying than helpful. Alex tells Arizona that it was he who cut off her leg, not Callie. When asked, Callie tells Arizona that she was the one to make the call anyway, and she wanted her to have Alex and just be mad at her alone. Owen and Amelia's separation becomes exacerbated when he's reminded of how he ‚Äúfailed his men‚Äù when he hired the service of the plane that went down with his doctors on it. Stephanie, who's obsessed with finding love, is determined to make her patient remember the pilot with whom she fell in love. The clock finally strikes 5:00 pm, but when Meredith goes to the phone to call Derek, she sees lights from a cop car pulling in her driveway. Reception Broadcast The episode was initially aired on April 16, 2015 and was viewed by 7.60 million viewers on its initial airing marking an increase from the previous episode \\"Crazy Love\\" which was watched by 7.42 million viewers. It garnered a 2.1/7 Nielsen ratings an increase from the previous installment. Reviews The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics. The reactions of Owen, Meredith and Arizona to the plane crash were praised but critics disliked the developments in the relationship of Owen Hunt and Amelia Shepherd. TvEquals wrote, \\"Overall, ‚ÄúOne Flight Down‚Äù was a solid episode ‚Äì not my favorite, but pretty entertaining. Owen and Meredith dealing with their respective guilt and PTSD, along with Maggie learning about the crash and Lexie, were the strongest parts of the episode.\\" also praising Kevin McKidd, \\"Owen opening up about his guilt about being responsible for signing off on the plane that crashed was my favorite aspect of revisiting the fatal events from a few seasons ago. Kevin McKidd was so great in that scene.\\" Entertainment Weekly praised Owen's character saying, \\"Owen‚Äôs not‚Äîhis guilt is irrational, but it‚Äôs real. And to see that, something that so many people struggle with in real life, on TV is both comforting and powerful.\\" Criticizing the development of Owen-Amelia relationship the site wrote, \\"Owen and Amelia‚Äôs relationship is far from easy and slowly descending into farce. It almost seems too complicated to keep going and this is Owen‚Äôs modus operendi in cutting it dead. This is a very confused coupling and in danger of losing fans even before it‚Äôs really got started. \\" Also criticizing their relationship Ashley Bissette of Tv Fanatic wrote, \\"Amelia and Owen are making me want to bang my head against a wall. I initially loved the idea of these two being together, but now they are just infuriating.\\" Zap2it noted Patrick Dempsey's absence, \\"Just as fans were used to having him back after his sojourn to D.C. and declaring that he loves Meredith (Ellen Pompeo) and his family more than changing the world, Derek Shepherd has gone missing.\\" The episode also focused on Kelly McCreary's character learning about Lexie Grey (Meredith's sister)) and the story-arc was praised, Tv Equals wrote, \\"I had completely forgotten that during the midst of all of this sisterly bonding, Maggie knew nothing about Lexie.

It was primarily a social organization, but it also advocated for, and helped to secure, recognition and benefits for nurses who had served in the war. Background Over 3,000 middle-class white women served as paid or volunteer nurses during the Civil War, working under the charge of Superintendent of Army Nurses Dorothea Dix. Many of them had no prior medical training. They learned on the job through hard experience, while being exposed to the dangers of the battlefield. Often they were greeted with hostility by the male army surgeons. After the war, these women often received no official government recognition or pension for their services. History The organization was established by Dorothea Dix on June 18, 1881 as the \\"Ex- Nurse's Association of the District of Columbia.\\" It was a social organization, but also advocated for recognition and benefits for members. The society worked to aid members in seeking employment, to care for them during illness, and to promote the honor of the Union. Dix was elected president of the organization for life. The group met each year in Washington DC, and soon started meeting during the National Encampments (reunions of Civil War veterans) held most years by the Grand Army of the Republic. The group met in during the G.A.R. encampment of 1888. The group met annually. Memorial to U.S. Civil War nurses in Massachusetts State House: \\"Angels of mercy and life amid scenes of conflict and death\\" At the Encampment of 1892, the group attracted 35 members from all across the United States. Therefore, the group's name was changed to the National Association of Army Nurses of the Late War. No meetings were held for two years, but the roup re-instituted for a national meeting in Louisville, Kentucky on September 13, 1895. In 1897, the group, then known as the National Army Nurses Association, convened in Buffalo at their headquarters at the Women's Christian Association Building. There were about 500 members. Association members also came together for the annual G.A.R. encampment of 1899, which was held in Philadelphia. The officers that year were: Elizabeth W. Ewing of Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, president; Kate M. Scott of Brookville, Pennsylvania, secretary; Elizabeth Chapman of St. Louis, Missouri, senior vice president; Della A. Fay of Upper Jay, New York, junior vice president; Jeannette M. Morrill of Santon, Michigan, chaplain; Lydia L. Whiteman of Philadelphia, treasurer; Susanna Kripps of Philadelphia, press correspondent; Emily E. Woodley of Philadelphia, councillor; Mary Aston of Philadelphia, financial secretary; Fanny Titus Hazen of Cambridge, Massachusetts, installing officer; and Julia Magill of Florence, New Jersey, guard. All were reported by local newspapers as planning to attend that year's encampment.\\"Veterans Who Will Be at the G.A.R. Celebration Owe Their Lives to the Heroic Self-Sacrifice of These Women Nurses.\\" Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: The Philadelphia Times, Sunday, 20 August 1899. By 1901, the name was changed to National Association of Army Nurses of the Civil War to distinguish it from the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The organization disbanded in September 1931, when only five members were still living. Membership Membership was open to applicants who had served at least three months as a paid or volunteer nurse during the Civil War. Documentation was required, and applications needed approval by the local Grand Army of the Republic post. An 1897 article listed some members of the organization: Dorothea Dix, Harriet P. Dame, Annie Wittanmyer, Nansy Biser, Susan Edson and Caroline Burghardt, Clara Barton, \\"Mother\\" Bickerdyke, Mary A. Livermore, and Mary S. Gist. Officers of the organization in 1897 consisted of Emily E. Woodley of Philadelphia (President); Elizabeth W. Ewing of Phoenixvile, PA; Elizabeth Chapman of East St. Louis; Sarah K. Clark of Winona, Minn; Hannah L. Palmer of Canastota, NY; Lydia L. Whiteman of Philadelphia; Mary A. Aston of Philadelphia; Addie L. Ballors of San Francisco; Miss Hancock of Philadelphia; and Mrs. Kripp of Philadelphia. Benefits Chief among the achievements of this association were the efforts of its leaders to secure recognition and benefits for the women who had served as nurses during the American Civil War. Pensions: In 1892, Congress passed a law which allowed for a pension of $12 per month for all nurses who had been hired and paid by the Government. However, most volunteer nurses still were not awarded pensions, at least as of 1910. National cemetery privileges: Members (and in fact all nurses of the Civil War), were entitled to burial in National Cemeteries.

He spent some time living in Norway with his parents before studying at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen beginning in 1825. There he initially studied under Jens Peter M√∏ller, but his greatest influence was from the romantic art of Johan Christian Dahl. Career Between 1829 and 1831 S√∏dring travelled to Norway and Germany, taking time to study in Munich. He traveled to Norway and Southern Sweden between 1832-36 and returned during 1847. He was awarded the Fund ad Usus Publicos 1836-38. He travelled to Germany (mainly Munich) 1836-38; Paris 1843. He continued to work, sending several paintings back to Denmark. These travels influenced S√∏dring's later works. Upon his return, he continued to paint, exhibiting landscapes from the Rhine, Southern Germany, and Tyrol. In 1832, he was painted by Christen K√∏bke; the portrait is now part of the Hirschsprung Collection. He exhibited at the Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition 1828-36, 1838-40, 1842-47, 1858.

During his career, Adkinson has been featured in Prog Magazine, Billboard Magazine, Free Times Columbia, Creative Loafing, Stomp and Stammer and more. Adkinson is a PRS endorsed artist and is known for using the S2 Mira Antique White and the S2 Custom 22 SH. History Adkinson released his debut EP Disasterpiece in August 2004, his first venture as a solo singer/songwriter after many years playing drums in punk, rock, funk and progressive rock bands. Over time, Adkinson built a loyal following throughout the southern US, playing in college towns and opening for Lovedrug, Patterson Hood (Drive-by Truckers), Edwin McCain, Copeland and more. In 2007, Adkinson released his second EP, Bipolaroid moving away from the acoustic based pop of Disasterpiece and into electronic music with more progressive leanings. Shortly after the release of Bipolaroid, Adkinson embarked on a 180-date tour of the United States. In 2012, Adkinson began work on another EP, 1984 with producer/engineer Brandon Ham at Red Sparrow Studios in Wilson, North Carolina. The sessions heralded the tracks 'Say Something', 'Diamond Girl' and 'Even Now'. It was during this same period that Adkinson traveled to Charleston Sound Studios in Charleston, South Carolina to record a new batch of songs. These sessions provided Adkinson with the hit song 'Cutthroat', which was featured in PROG magazine. In 2013, with the success of 1984 and the Charleston sessions, Adkinson began work on what was to become his first full- length album, Villain with producer/engineer Brandon Ham. After 18 months in the studio writing and recording, Adkinson released Villain independently on September 22, 2014. The album was well received and has sold over 10,000 copies as of April 2015. Adkinson is currently working on his new studio album Heathens with producer Brandon Ham (Set It Off (band), Sent by Ravens, Divided By Friday) once again, alongside engineer Chris Wenner (Toro y Moi, Say Brother, The Jackson Spells). In an interview released on Adkinson's Facebook page in June 2016, Adkinson confirmed that he was working with UK based production company Crystal Spotlight (Steven Wilson, Jethro Tull, Haken) on a music video for Judas, the lead single from Heathens.

The type and only species is Chilesaurus diegosuarezi. Chilesaurus lived about 145 million years ago (Mya) in the Late Jurassic period of Chile. Showing a combination of traits from theropods, ornithischians, and sauropodomorphs, this genus has far-reaching implications for the evolution of dinosaurs, such as whether the traditional saurischian-ornithischian split is superior or inferior to the newly proposed group Ornithoscelida.  Description  Life restoration of Chilesaurus showing characteristic arm-folding and speculative filaments Chilesaurus measured roughly from nose to tail. The holotype is a smaller individual of half that length. The most unusual feature of Chilesaurus is its spatula-shaped, elongated teeth, obliquely pointing forwards. Such dentition would be unique in the Theropoda, where it has sometimes been recovered, and is typical for a herbivore, indicating Chilesaurus was a plant-eater. Another adaptation for eating plants is the backward-pointing pubic bone in the pelvis, making room for a large gut. Such a pelvic arrangement is typical for the Ornithischia, which some other studies have allied it with, although is also found in some groups of Theropoda. The hind limb of Chilesaurus had become less adapted to running as shown by a small cnemial crest on the front top of the shinbone, and a broad foot with a weight-bearing first toe. Chilesaurus could defend itself with a strong arm, bearing a large first claw which could be extended outwards, just as with the basal Sauropodomorpha.  Discovery and naming  Reconstructed skeleton Reconstructed jaw Life restoration of Chilesaurus, size based on holotype individual Fossils of Chilesaurus, a vertebra and a rib, were first discovered on 4 February 2004 by the seven-year-old Diego Su√°rez, who together with his parents, geologists Manuel Su√°rez and Rita de la Cruz, was searching for decorative stones in the Ays√©n Region. More specimens were present that in 2008 were reported as representing several dinosaurian species. Only later was it realised that these belonged to a single species with a bizarre combination of traits. In 2015, the type species C. diegosuarezi was named and described by Fernando Emilio Novas, Leonardo Salgado, Manuel Su√°rez, Federico Lisandro Agnol√≠n, Mart√≠n Dario Ezcurra, Nicol√°s Chimento, Rita de la Cruz, Marcelo Pablo Isasi, Alexander Omar Vargas, and David Rubilar-Rogers. The generic name refers to Chile. The specific name honours Diego Su√°rez. The holotype, SNGM-1935, was found in a layer of the Toqui Formation dating from the late Tithonian. It consists of an articulated, rather complete skeleton with skull of a juvenile individual, lacking the feet and most of the tail. Four other partial skeletons (specimens SNGM-1937, SNGM-1936, SNGM-1938, and SNGM-1888) and several single bones (specimens SNGM-1889, SNGM-1895, SNGM-1901, SNGM-1894, SNGM-1898, SNGM-1900, and SNGM-1903) are the paratypes. They represent juvenile and adult individuals.  Classification  Reconstructed right manus Chilesaurus was first placed in the theropod group Tetanurae, in a basal position. It shows a confusing mix of traits normally present in Coelurosauria, basal Sauropodomorpha and Ornithischia, but was found in its original description to belong to none of these groups. The below cladogram illustrates the taxonomy proposed in the original description of Chilesaurus. Alternatively, Baron & Barrett proposed in 2017 that Chilesaurus may be a basal ornithischian, with ornithischians being closer to theropods than sauropodomorphs as a part of the Ornithoscelida.https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/study-identifies-dinosaur- missing-link Less than a year later, M√ºller et al. (2018) published a reply to Baron & Barrett (2017), arguing that their phylogenetic dataset actually suggested that Chilesaurus was a basal sauropodomorph rather than an ornithischian. Baron & Barrett reached out to M√ºller et al. to inform them that they had accidentally published a faulty early version of their dataset with many traits scored incorrectly, and that their original results were based on an edited final dataset. They corrected their original publication and supplied the final dataset to M√ºller et al., who agreed that it supported the placement of Chilesaurus in Ornithischia as Baron & Barrett (2017) argued. However, M√ºller et al. also noted that Baron & Barrett did not test the original proposal of Chilesaurus as a theropod, and that its classification was still uncertain. Baron & Barrett disagreed, stating how Chilesaurus was recovered as an ornithischian regardless of the parameters used in analyses, and that the uncertainty claimed by M√ºller et al. was a result of the erroneous dataset being supplied to those authors. Baron & Barrett also note that Chilesaurus is crucial to their finding of Ornithoscelida, a new hypothesis of dinosaur evolution which places theropods with ornithischians instead of sauropodomorphs. Below is a cladogram illustrating the classification proposed by Baron & Barrett (2017), which places Chilesaurus as the most basal ornithischian.

Robert Kay was born in 1728 to John Kay and Ann Holt. He became a shuttlemaker in his native Bury, Lancashire, married in 1748 and had several children. His father emigrated to France in 1747 and was joined there by Robert and two other sons, James and John. The flying shuttle, also known as the wheel-shuttle, had been invented by John senior around 1733 but his commercial acumen did not match his engineering ingenuity and financial problems may have contributed to the move abroad. Robert had returned to Bury probably in 1759 and in either that year or 1760, he designed a method for deploying multiple shuttles simultaneously, enabling the use of wefts of more than one colour and so making it easier for the weaver to produce cross-striped material. These shuttles were housed at the side of the loom in what became known as the drop box. He did not patent the invention but went on to produce other improvements to the shuttle that assisted in producing checked material and ticking for beds, as well as a mechanism for manufacturing the cards used in carding machines. The drop box probably caused an increase in the use of the flying shuttle: combining the two made the weaving mechanism more complex, but it greatly increased the production speed of even fairly complex cloths.

Through positive airway pressure, and in severe cases chest compressions, medical personnel can often stimulate neonates to begin breathing on their own, with attendant normalization of heart rate. About a quarter of all neonatal deaths globally are caused by birth asphyxia.Guidelines on basic newborn resuscitation, 2012, World Health Organization This dangerous condition of oxygen deprivation may begin before birth, for example if the umbilical cord, which supplies oxygen throughout fetal development, is compressed during delivery. Depending on how quickly and successfully the infant is resuscitated, hypoxic damage can occur to most of the infant's organs (heart, lungs, liver, gut, kidneys), although brain injury known as neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is of most concern. The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) has published Consensus on science and treatment recommendations for neonatal resuscitation in 2000, 2005 and 2010. Traditionally, newborn children have been resuscitated using mechanical ventilation with 100% oxygen, but there has since the 1980s increasingly been debated whether newborn infants with asphyxia should be resuscitated with 100% oxygen or normal air, and notably Ola Didrik Saugstad has been a major advocate of using normal air. It has been demonstrated that high concentrations of oxygen lead to generation of oxygen free radicals, which have a role in reperfusion injury after asphyxia. Clinical trial evidence suggests that resuscitation using air probably reduces the risk of death and the 2010 ILCOR guidelines recommend the use of normal air rather than 100% oxygen.ILCOR Neonatal Resuscitation Guidelines 2010 For preterm infants, there may be little or no difference in risk of death or neurodevelopment disability when higher concentrations of oxygen are used compared to lower concentrations but the evidence from clinical trials is still relatively uncertain.

Journal of Sir Hugh Low  Sadka believed that Hugh Low, third British resident at Perak, was \\"one of the greatest of Malaya's administrators,\\" but noted that he had been neglected by writers of Malayan history, with only passing references made in the notes made by Swettenham and Winstedt. At that time his private papers could not be located and much of Perak's official records, and those of the Colonial Secretary's Office in Singapore had been destroyed during the Japanese Occupation of Malaya. The only thing, remaining at that time was the first volume of his handwritten journals, at that time kept at the Federal Secretariat in Kuala Lumpur [and now kept at the National Archives of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur], that spanned his first eight weeks in Perak (19 April to 15 June 1877). Sadka worked on deciphering, and transcribing and correcting the text of this manuscript. It was published, two years later, in 1955.Sadka, Emily, ed. The Journal of Sir Hugh Low, Perak, 1877.

The French language is one of the languages spoken in Morocco. The use of French is a colonial legacy of the French protectorate (1912‚Äì1956), and French no longer has any officially recognized status in Morocco. It is considered a prestige language in Morocco, and is often used for business, diplomacy, and government, serving as a lingua franca with non-Moroccans and non-Arabs. Aleya Rouchdy, author of Language Contact and Language Conflict in Arabic, said that \\"For all practical purposes, French is used as a second language.\\" Different figures of French speakers in Morocco are given. According to the OIF, 33% of Moroccans speak French, among them 13.5% are fully francophone (fluent speakers) and 19.5% partially francophone. History The Treaty of Fes of 1912 created the French protectorate in Morocco, which imposed French in Morocco. The 1912 Treaty of Fes, which established the French Protectorate in Morocco, was negotiated in French, with Abdelqader Ben Ghabrit interpreting and translating for Sultan Abd al-Hafid, who spoke Arabic. French colonial authorities in Morocco introduced the French language to the country, making it the language of government administration, educational instruction, and the media; therefore Standard Arabic was only used for traditional activities and religious services. The French government had intended for the French culture and the French language to be viewed as \\"civilization and advancement\\". The French authorities forbade Moroccans from publishing newspapers in Arabic, especially if covering politics. Due to these restrictions, the Moroccan journalist Muhammad Ibn al-Hassan al-Wazzaani published (The Work of the People), the first francophone newspaper published by the Moroccan Nationalist Movement in the area under the control of the French Protectorate in Morocco, in Fes on August 4, 1933. The decision to publish in French was controversial; al-Wazzaani, who had studied in France, was one of the few who supported the use of French to address the colonial apparatus in its own language, and influence French popular opinion, both in Morocco and in France. In 1956 Morocco declared independence, and in the government declared Classical Arabic as the official language. In the early 1960s the Moroccan government began the Arabization process, in which the Istiqlal leader Allal al-Fassi played a major role. After independence, to facilitate economic growth and to increase its ties to Europe, the Moroccan government decided to strengthen its ties with France, resulting in the promotion of French. Under Hassan II, Arabization of the humanities was instrumentalized to suppress critical thought‚Äîreplacing the subject of \\"Sociology\\" with \\"Islamic Thought,\\" for example‚Äîin a move which Dr. Susan Gilson Miller described as a \\"crude and obvious attempt to foster a more conservative atmosphere within academia and to dampen enthusiasm for the radicalizing influences filtering in from Europe.\\" By 2005 Morocco engaged in economic liberalization and privatization; Moha Ennaji, author of Multilingualism, Cultural Identity, and Education in Morocco, said that these activities, in many sectors, reinforced the usage of French. In 2014, 75% of Facebook users in Morocco posted in French. Role and purpose French is mainly used in administration, banking, commerce, education, and industry. Rouchdy said that within Morocco, French \\"is the vehicle of science, technology, and modern culture.\\" Rouchdy further explained that the language had been \\"maintained for instrumental purposes and for building contacts with the West in general.\\" The French language became entrenched in various aspects of Moroccan society, including education, government, the media, and the private sector due to the French colonial authority enacting a policy to spread the French language throughout Morocco during the colonial era. As of 2005, trade with France made up over 75% of Morocco's international trade. Ennaji said \\"[i]n this context, one can understand the important status of French, whose colonial connotations have been erased or at least drastically reduced by independence.\\" Moroccans learn the French language at school. Secondary school graduates tend to achieve French fluency, and many Moroccans become fluent in French in addition to Moroccan Arabic and use French as their second language. Most Moroccans who are bilingual in French and Arabic live in urban areas where they have strong contact with the French language and where there are high literacy rates. Many Moroccans learn French to conduct business with French tourists; gain access to information, science, and technology; and to attend French-speaking educational facilities. Ennaji said that Moroccans learn French for educational, pragmatic, and sociocultural reasons. Ennaji said \\"The degree of mastery of French depends on the bilingual's level of education and socio- economic background, for the higher the level of education and the wealthier the family background, the bigger the frequency of speaking French and the more frequent the alternative use of French and Moroccan Arabic by a bilingual. These factors determine the bilingual's ability to choose one or the other language in a particular speech situation.\\" Abdel√¢li Bentahila, the author of the 1983 book Language Attitudes Among Arabic‚ÄìFrench Bilinguals in Morocco, said that Moroccans who were bilingual in both French and Arabic commonly spoke French when discussing matters related to reading, while at a pharmacy, while discussing matters with a doctor or employer, and while discussing scientific and technical topics. In Morocco, French has connotations of formality; Ennaji said that Moroccans tended to use French while discussing matters at work or at school, and therefore French is commonly spoken in offices and schools. If the other party in a conversation is French educated, Moroccans often speak in French or a mixture of Moroccan Arabic and French. French has a prestigious status in Moroccan society, so many bilingual Moroccans mix French and Moroccan Arabic in conversation or use French words in informal Moroccan Arabic conversations. According to Ennaji, in writing bilingual Moroccans only use French, and bilingual Moroccans tend to discuss scientific and technical topics only in French. Rouchdy said \\"The predominance of French implies that the chances of strengthening the place of Classical Arabic are reduced.\\" Attitudes toward French Despite the legacy of colonialism, according to Rouchdy, \\"French is still widely appreciated by both the ruling elite and the general public.\\" Ennaji said \\"most Moroccans know that Standard Arabic does not meet all their societal needs and that a European language is necessary for the transfer of ideas and technology, and for communication with the world at large, even if this European language is none but the ex-coloniser's language.\\" Rouchdy added that Classical/Modern Arabic and French are constantly in conflict with one another, but that most Moroccans believe that the bilingualism of Classical Arabic and French is the most optimal choice to allow for Morocco's development. French in art Within academic arts, French is the main language used. Academic art discourse had been conducted in French within a five decade period until 2010. Reviews of artwork and art journal articles mostly were published in French, while some newspaper coverage of gallery exhibits was in Arabic. Katarzyna Pieprzak, author of the 2010 book Imagined Museums: Art and Modernity in Postcolonial Morocco, attributes this to the fact that \\"modernist or academic visual art is a language that was learned in art schools in Europe, that the use of French reflects a desire to be heard and to participate in a Western-controlled international art sphere and market, and that audiences for both the museum and its artwork tend to be imagined as Francophone.\\" French has been the main language of art museums in Morocco; the , a national art museum, had many object labels in Arabic and French, although the object histories were only available in French in 2010. Pieprzak also concluded that \\"French continues to serve as a lingua franca that unites Moroccan artists not only to Europe but also to Francophone Africa.\\" See also * France‚ÄìMorocco relations *French Protectorate in Morocco *Geographical distribution of French speakers * Language Attitudes Among Arabic-French Bilinguals in Morocco * Moroccans in France References French Morocco ","title":"French language in Morocco"},{"id":"46537908","text":"James Ellington (born December 5, 1943) is an American Republican politician.

He was a member of the KgU (\\"Combat Group against Inhumanity\\") and became a victim of the epidemic of show trials that hit the country in the first half of the 1950s. He was executed in June 1955. Life Family The father of Gerhard Benkowitz was an army officer from Apolda in Thuringia who had volunteered to serve in the First World War. However, he had been captured by the Russians in 1915 and held by them as a prisoner of war. The war ended in 1918 and the army officer from Germany had married an ethnic German descendant of the Germans settled in the area during the time of Catherine the Great in the eighteenth century. The couple were still in Russia when Gerhard was born, but the next year they were able to return to Germany, where the family settled in Weimar. During the twelve year Nazi period the father held a position as an Ortsbauernf√ºhrer (local farmers' leader). War War resumed in September 1939 with an agreed joint invasion of Poland by Germany and the Soviet Union. Benkowitz was still at school, but in 1941 he deferred his School final exams and applied for a commission as an army officer. Two years later, on 12 July 1943, he was badly wounded at the Battle of Kursk while serving in a tank-grenadier regiment. Following a lengthy convalescence, and with a serious limp which he would retain for the rest of his life, In 1944 he studied medicine for a term at Jena. Aftermath of war Peace broke out, formally, in May 1945. His home region of Thuringia had been liberated by US forces but the winning powers had already agreed between themselves occupation zones that placed Thuringia in the Soviet occupation zone, and within a month the Americans had withdrawn, to be replaced by Soviet Military Administration across the entire central third of what had been Germany. At this time Benkowitz's father was arrested by the Soviet Secret Police: he disappeared and his fate remains unknown. Benkowitz obtained work initially as a sales representative for a food business, and later as an officer with the town administration in Weimar. From the end of 1946 he was working for the Military Administration in Thuringia. Politically there was initially a widespread belief that military defeat, by destroying the Hitler regime, had put an end to one-party government in Germany, and in the summer of 1946 Gerhard Benkowitz joined the newly established Liberal Democratic Party. During the autumn/fall of that year he resigned his party membership, however. As matters turned out 1946 was also the year in which the basis for a return to one-party government was established, with the contentious merger of the Communist Party and, within the Soviet occupation zone, of the more moderately left-wing Social Democratic Party, forming together the Socialist Unity Party (SED / Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands). Within a couple of years former SPD members had been persuaded out of positions of influence within the new party which had soon become the East German Communist Party by another name. In 1948 Gerhard Benkowitz joined the country's ruling SED (party), probably on \\"professional grounds\\". The Russian teacher Pestalozzi School In October 1948 Germany's Soviet occupation zone was refounded as the German Democratic Republic. Soviet sponsorship of the new state continued to be reflected by large numbers of Soviet military and administrative personnel in positions of authority, and in the schools there was a corresponding shortage of Russian language teachers. In 1949 Benkowitz became a Youth Development Leader in Weimar, and he also undertook a Russian course at a specialist school: in 1950 he took a job teaching Russian in nearby Buttst√§dt. He transferred to the Karl Marx School back in Weimar in 1951, and became in 1954 a deputy head teacher at the Pestalozzi School. The KgU activist In 1949 Gerhard Benkowitz began working with the Kampfgruppe gegen Unmenschlichkeit (KgU / \\"Combat Group against Inhumanity\\"), a Berlin-based anti-Communist human rights advocacy group widely believed to be funded and supported by US Intelligence. He hoped that the KgU's Berlin contacts would enable him to learn the whereabouts of his father who had been arrested by the Soviet secret police in 1945. Initially he delivered opinion reports to the KgU. In Autumn/Fall 1950 he created an illegal opposition cell-group which sometimes involved carrying an illegal weapon. In the period 1950-52 he was involved in the planning of missions involving explosives and sabotage, but none of these was ever implemented. They appear to have been contingency plans that could be implemented if mandated by the KgU's US sponsors. With the outbreak in 1950 of the Korean War there was a concern that something similar might blow up between the two politically polarised halves of Germany: if it had, the KgU would have been seen as a potential fifth column for the west behind the eastern front line, and the photographs accumulated by Benkowitz's Weimar based group of bridges and other installations vulnerable to sabotage would have been useful for identifying targets. After 1952 the KgU turned away from their militant strategy, however, and Benkowitz's group took to more directly political activities, such as distributing fly-leaflets, gathering information, and sending threatening letters to East German government officials. Arrest On 4 April 1955 Gerhard Benkowitz and his wife Erika were arrested in Weimar. The next day Hans-Dietrich and Christa Kogel were arrested, also in Weimar. These arrests were part of a wider Stasi operation carried out under the code name \\"Operation Blitz\\" (\\"Operation Lightning\\"). Benkowitz had probably been denounced to the Stasi by a fellow KgU member called Rupprecht Wagner who shortly afterwards left the organisation and in September 1955 joined the Stasi. Hans-Dietrich Kogel (1925‚Äì1955) was a clerical official with the Weimar City Council: his work involved in Planning and Statistics. The Weimar arrests coincided with others, including those of a courier called Willibald Schuster from Gro√üebersdorf, a railway employee called Gerhard Kacher and a student called Christian Busch. Those arrested were taken initially to the Stasi prison in Erfurt, being transferred during ay 1955 to the principal Stasi pre-trial detention prison at Berlin.Gerhard Finn: Die Widerstandsarbeit der Kampfgruppe gegen Unmenschlichkeit (PDF; 330 kB), in: Unrecht √ºberwinden ‚Äì SED-Diktatur und Widerstand. (Aktuelle Fragen der Politik, Nr. 38), St. Augustin 1996. The two couples from Weimar knew each other, but had absolutely no connection with the others arrested. The show trial which took place subsequently had been planned by the Party Leadership at the beginning of 1955, but at that stage the Benkowitz and Kogel couples had not been listed as targets of \\"Operation Blitz\\". The decision to integrate their cases into the subsequent show trial appears to have been taken at very short notice. During interrogation Gerhard Benkowitz admitted to his preparations for blowing up the Bleiloch valley dam, the six arch railway bridge at Weimar and other appropriate sabotage targets. Hans-Dietrich Kogel was to have been in charge of looking after the explosives. Gerhard Benkowitz and Hans-Dietrich Kogel separately provided detailed corroboratory statements on these aspects. Gerhard Benkowitz vehemently denied having been issued with explosives, and after an informant introduced into the suspects' detention cell obtained no countervailing evidence, this detail was removed from the charges against Benkowitz. The Stasi officers working on Benkowitz and the public defense lawyer had persuaded him that a detailed self-incrimination and remorse could save him. By believing the assurances he received he unwittingly supported the choreography of the show trial being prepared for him. Trial The trial opened formally on 14 June 1955. As in most show trials of the period, matters proceeded not according to professional legal principals but according to propagandist criteria. The more heavily implicated Weimar group members, Benkowitz and Kogel, were tried jointly with three other accused, Willibald Schuster and Gerhard Kammacher, rail workers from Triptis, and the Berlin Veterinary student Christian Busch, who was the only one of the five who was known, from the Stasi's own information, to have had direct contact with the KgU leader in Berlin, Gerd Baitz. By the time the trial started, both the guilty verdict and the death sentence had been predetermined at the highest level. In Berlin the Party Central Committee had endorsed the proposal from Klaus Sorgenicht, head of the committee's \\"National and Legal Affairs Department\\", that Gerhard Benkowitz should be condemned to death. For his co-accused, Hans-Dietrich Kogel, Sorgenicht proposed a fifteen-year prison sentence: it was the head of state himself, Walter Ulbricht who rejected this advice in favour of a second death sentence for Kogel. The pattern for East German show trials had already been set earlier in the decade, and reaction to Benkowitz's trial had been carefully scripted. The national newspaper, Neues Deutschland, stated that \\"the entire anger of our people is directed against such creatures\\".Neues Deutschland 23 June 1955\\"Der Ganze Zorn unseres Volkes wendet sich gegen solche Kreaturen.\\" The party newspaper also reported a letter from his teaching colleagues at the Pestalozzi School calling for \\"strong punishments against the five agents\\" (\\"die strenge Bestraffung der f√ºnf Agenten\\") and pledging to be \\"more vigilant than ever in preventing diminution of the success of our Worker-Peasant state by criminal elements of this kind\\".\\"...noch wachsamer als bisher zu sein, um zu verhindern, da√ü die Erfolge unseres Arbeiter-und-Bauern-Staates durch solche Verbrecherische Elemente geschm√§lert wird. The actual court hearings took place on 22 and 23 June 1955. On 29 June 1955 the death sentences were carried out \\"in the name of the people\\". State execution had been centralised in Germany under the previous regime: Gerhard Benkowitz and Hans-Dietrich Kogel lost their lives at the National Execution Centre in Dresden. Erika Gerhard Benkowitz's wife Erika also worked as a teacher at their local Pestalozzi School. She had been arrested with him, and was sentenced on 20 July by a court in Erfurt to a twelve-year prison sentence. The court asserted that she should have assumed that the stories and reports that she had helped her husband compile would have been used for espionage purposes.Petra Weber: Justiz und Diktatur.

On 23 April 2015, Election Commissioner Richard Mawrey voided Rahman's election under the Representation of the People Act 1983 on the grounds of corrupt and illegal practices by him and his agents, and general corruption so extensively prevailing so to reasonably supposed to have affected the election. Rahman's official election agent Alibor Choudhury was ordered to vacate his own office of councillor in the ward of Stepney Green for being guilty of corrupt and illegal practices. Lutfur Rahman was first elected to the position of mayor in 2010, standing as an independent after controversy surrounded his placement on the Labour Party candidate shortlist and the eventual selection and almost immediate deselection as the party's official candidate. For the 2014 election, Rahman represented Tower Hamlets First, which was formed the year before with Rahman its leader and Choudhury its treasurer. Out of 84,234 accepted votes, Rahman received 36,539 (43.38%) first preference votes with John Biggs second with 27,643 (32.82%). Following a transfer of 856 (11.64%) second preference votes to Rahman and 6,500 (88.36%) to Biggs, Rahman was re-elected as mayor with a winning margin of 3,252 votes. On 10 June 2014, Andy Erlam, Debbie Simone, Azmal Hussein, and Angela Moffat in their position as electors at the election presented a petition to the High Court questioning Lutfur Rahman's election as mayor on the grounds that among other things Rahman or his agents, or both, committed corrupt and illegal practices contrary to the 1983 Act. Independently of the allegation against Rahman, the petition also requested the election to be set aside on the ground that the returning officer John Williams or his officials, or both, failed to conduct the election correctly under election law.  Background   Facts  Troxy theatre, the venue for the election count The 2014 Tower Hamlets Mayoral Election took place on 22 May 2014, concurrently with elections to all 45 seats on the Tower Hamlets London Borough Council, and the 2014 European Parliament election. Ten candidates stood for mayor, with incumbent Lutfur Rahman representing Tower Hamlets First and challengers representing the Conservative Party, Green Party, Labour Party, Liberal Democrats, UKIP, and TUSC along with 3 independents. Voting in the mayoral election was conducted using the supplementary vote system whereby the voter has the option to express a second preference choice, which would be counted in the event no candidate receives more than half the first preference votes and the second preference vote is for one of the two candidates with the most votes in the first round. Lutfur Rahman was declared winner of the 2014 Tower Hamlets Mayoral Election some time before 2am on 24 May 2014 with a total of 37,395 first and second preference votes over John Biggs 34,143 votes.  Legal  The result of a local election may only be overturned as a result of findings following an election petition presented by one of the candidates or at least four eligible voters. The time limit for presenting a petition is generally 21 days after the election. Alternatively, anyone convicted in a criminal court of corrupt or illegal electoral practice is required to vacate their elected office. A successful challenge through an election petition voids the election itself, such that the otherwise successful candidate is not considered ever lawfully elected. In contrast, a criminal conviction causes a vacancy to arise, but the original election is considered valid. In either case, a person convicted or reported by an election court personally guilty of corrupt practices is additionally barred from holding any elective office or being registered as a voter for a period of five years. For illegal practices, the period of disqualification is three years. While an election petition is pursued similarly to normal civil claims, a judge sitting in an election court holds more of an inquisitorial role. This inquisitorial power requires the judge to examine and investigate possible electoral malpractice in the electoral area as a whole as opposed to being limited to determining the questions posed by the petition. To aid its decision, the court has the power to require the attendance of any person as a witness, and to examine such a witness even if they are not called by either of the opposing parties. Witnesses are required to answer all questions posed to them, but none of their answers may be admitted as evidence against them in future court proceedings except in cases of perjury proceeding against the witness in respect of the evidence given. Though it is a civil court, the general standard of proof used by an election court for allegations of corrupt or illegal practices is that of a criminal one, namely that of beyond reasonable doubt. The same criminal standard of proof was used by Richard Mawrey on determining whether there were general corruption designed to secure Lutfur Rahman's election, but the lower civil standard on whether such corruption affected the result. Representation At the election court trial, the petitioners were represented by Francis Hoar, Lutfur Rahman was represented by Duncan Penny QC, instructed by K&L; Gates; and the returning officer was represented by Timothy Straker QC, instructed by Sharpe Pritchard.  Pre-trial hearings   Protective Costs Order  In light of the possible financial cost that may be awarded against them if their petition proved to be unsuccessful, the petitioners applied for a limited protective costs order on 9 July 2014 to cap any potential cost recovery by the respondents to no more than ¬£25,000 plus VAT, and their own cost to ¬£50,000 plus VAT. Subsequently, the petitioners attempted to adjourn the application, which along with the application itself was denied after a hearing by High Court judges Michael Supperstone and Robin Spencer sitting as a divisional court on the grounds that the petitioners had deliberately failed to disclose their financial means when making the initial application.  Application to dismiss petition  At the same hearing, the divisional court heard an application by Lutfur Rahman to dismiss the petition under Rule 4(1)(d) of the Election Petition Rules 1960 or the inherent jurisdiction of the court, or both. Counsel for Rahman argued for the dismissal on the grounds that the petition's many allegations of electoral offences was stated without sufficient details as to the basis of the allegations. In rejecting the application for dismissal, the court referenced among other things Saghir & Ors v Najib & Ors and Hussein & Ors v Khan & Ors in support of the petitioners' position that election court have at least since the mid- nineteenth century allowed further details to be provided on request, instead of dismissing an election petition outright, an action the divisional court then undertook by ordering for more details to be provided by the petitioners in response to request previously made by both respondents individually.  Location of trial  The Royal Courts of Justice, where the trial eventually took place Following the divisional court hearing into Lutfur Rahman application to dismiss and the petitioners application for an adjournment of their application for a protective costs order, Supperstone J sitting on his own heard an application by the petitioners to move the trial outside of Tower Hamlets for fear of intimidation by supporters of Rahman. This request was rejected by the court which held the prospect of large number of attendees and the associated potential for public rowdiness was not enough to justify ignoring the long-standing provision within primary legislation requiring trials to be held in the local government area for which the election was held, in this case the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. During its argument, counsel for John Williams drew the court attention to section 130(7) of the 1983 Act of the power of the election court to adjourn the trial to another place at the Commissioner discretion, a discretion Richard Mawrey subsequently exercised when he moved the trial to the Royal Courts of Justice from Tower Hamlets Town Hall after regarding the town hall as not a neutral venue.  Election court hearing  Following agreement between the petitioners and John Williams, allegations against the returning officer and his staff were withdrawn on the first day of the hearing. Overall, Richard Mawrey found Lutfur Rahman's testimony unreliable and evasive, in most instances preferring other witnesses' evidence where they conflicted with Rahman's. Mawrey also expressed dissatisfaction over \\"one or two witnesses\\" use of interpreter when they clearly demonstrated a good understanding of the English language, such as answering questions before the interpreter has spoken, or when the witness is the editor of an English language newspaper. Throughout the case, it was the petitioners submission that Tower Hamlets First was in reality a \\"one-man band\\" for the sole purpose of the continuation of Lutfur Rahman as mayor, rather than a genuine political party. This position was given further support by Rahman's own evidence and that of his witnesses, with the admission that candidates for Tower Hamlets First required Rahman's personal approval. Given Rahman's control over candidates selection, the candidates were taken to be within the category of Rahman's agents under electoral law.  False registration  Provision of false information to a registration officer is an offence under section 13D of the 1983 Act. While no specific allegation of false registration was particularised on the election petition, evidences were heard by the court as part of the case on personation and other voting offences. A schedule containing multiple false registrations were submitted to and accepted by the court where all entries were shown to have voted for Rahman. Particular examples of false registration highlighted in the judgment include that of former councillor Kabir Ahmed, councillor Shahed Ali, Moniruzzaman Syed, and Aktaruz Zaman all of whom were candidates representing Tower Hamlets First at the 2014 Tower Hamlets council election in the wards of Weavers, Whitechapel, Bromley North, and both St Peter's and Blackwall & Cubitt Town respectively.  Personation  Voting with a false registration in the name of another person satisfy the offence of personation under section 60 of the 1983 Act, and all of the entries listed in the schedule of false registrations are known to have voted.  Voting when not entitled  Having concluded that Kabir Ahmed, Moniruzzaman Syed, and Aktaruz Zaman voted in their own name, but with an otherwise false registration, it follows that they are guilty of an offence of voting when not entitled under section 61(1) of the 1983 Act.  Double voting  In the case of Shahed Ali who was registered at two different addresses within the ward he was successfully elected in, both registrations were used to vote in the election for Lutfur Rahman. If both registrations were used by Ali, then he had committed an offence of voting more than once under section 61(2) of the 1983 Act. Where one of the registration was used by another person, that person would be guilty of personation.  Postal vote offences  The court heard evidences of men representing or acting on behalf of Lutfur Rahman inducing voters to hand over partially completed postal voting documents, and in certain instances taking the uncompleted ballot papers against the voter's will. An expert witness gave evidence that out of 134 ballots analysed, two set of approximately one quarter of the total were completed in the same ink. Additionally, many of the documents analysed showed inconsistent electrostatic detection apparatus impressions, whereby different parts of the voting documents were completed by different authors. While none of the evidence in isolation would be enough for a finding of corrupt practices, it was Richard Mawrey's view that taken together the criminal standard for postal vote offences under section 62A was met.  Tampering with ballot papers  Of the 46 ballot papers accepted showing a change of first preference vote from another candidate to Lutfur Rahman, 26 were from an original vote for John Biggs. Richard Mawrey concluded that this was not sufficient a pattern to reach the criminal standard of proof for the alleged offence of tampering with ballot papers.  False statements about a candidate   Payment of canvassers   Bribery   Treating   Undue influence  = Spiritual injury = = Intimidation = It was the petitioners allegations that there were undue influence under section 115 of the 1983 Act through \\"intimidation at polling stations, voters going into polling booths together or leaving campaign material inside polling booths\\". The court in its judgment quickly rejected that going into polling booths together or leaving campaign material amounts to undue influence, leaving only intimidation at polling stations to be more thoroughly considered. = Misleading of voters = On the allegation that voters were misled by being told that Lutfur Rahman was the Labour Party candidate, the court decided that the evidence presented \\"was much too flimsy\\".  General corruption   Judgment  Tower Hamlets Town Hall at Mulberry Place, the original location of the trial, and the venue for the count of the subsequent election held in June 2015. Lutfur Rahman was found personally guilty by the court of making false statements about a candidate, bribery, and undue spiritual influence. The court also found Rahman guilty by his agents of personation, postal vote offences, provision of false information to a registration officer, voting when not entitled, making false statements about a candidate, payment of canvassers, bribery, and undue spiritual influence. A finding that corrupt and illegal practices for the purpose of securing Rahman's election, and that such general corruption so extensively prevailed such that it could be reasonably concluded to have affected the result was also returned. Alibor Choudhury was found personally guilty of bribery, making false statements about a candidate, and payment of canvassers. As a consequence of the findings, the 2014 mayoral election was deemed void, and Alibor Choudhury was required to vacate his office of councillor with immediate effect. Both Rahman and Choudhury are barred from holding elective office, voting or being registered as a voter for five years as bribery and undue influence constitute corrupt practices. While non-practising, Rahman was a solicitor on the Solicitors Regulation Authority's roll of solicitors. As such, a copy of the judgment was brought to the attention of the Solicitors Regulation Authority for potential misconduct proceedings against Rahman as required by section 162 of the 1983 Act. More generally, the court also certified that corrupt practices extensively prevailed at the 2014 Tower Hamlets council election.  Reaction  After the ruling, Lutfur Rahman and Tower Hamlets First released a statement on Rahman's personal website expressing their shock at the decision and rejecting the court's findings. The statement further alleges that \\"the court system was marred by bias, slurs and inaccuracies\\", and notes Rahman intention to appeal the judgment. An online petition hosted on 38 Degrees in support of Rahman attracted more than 6,400 supporters. A rally in support of Rahman was organised a week after the court judgment, where supporters were encouraged to donate to a fund set up in aid of Rahman possible appeal. Speakers at the rally included ex-MP George Galloway, and former Mayor of London Ken Livingstone. Expression of support was given by Len McCluskey, General Secretary of Unite the Union. Lead petitioner Andy Erlam called the result \\"a fantastic result for democracy\\". John Biggs, who came second in the May 2014 election released a statement saying: A Tower Hamlets Council spokesperson welcomed the Commissioner's judgment which cleared John Williams and council staff of allegations of fraudulent practices related to the running of the May 2014 election. The spokesperson also said: Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles said the judgment vindicated the government's decision to interfere into the London Borough of Tower Hamlets the previous year. Based on the election court findings that Tower Hamlets First did not operate any responsible financial scheme, nor in the manners as submitted in its registration as a political party, the Electoral Commission removed Tower Hamlets First from its register of political parties on 29 April 2015. The 17 remaining councillors affiliated with Tower Hamlets First went on to sit as an Independent Group. Shahed Ali was later disqualified as a councillor after pleading guilty to housing benefit fraud. Of the remaining 16, 7 eventually left the group, 4 of whom sat together under the banner People's Alliance of Tower Hamlets with Shafi Ahmed who replaced Ali as councillor, with the rest as independents. At a rally in support of Rahman, part-time judge and Chair of the Society of Black Lawyers Peter Herbert criticised the Commissioner's judgment. In the same speech, Herbert also said: By-elections to fill the vacancy created by the removals of Lutfur Rahman and Alibor Choudhury were held on 11 June 2015. Labour's Sabina Akhtar was elected as councillor in the ward of Stepney Green with 42.11% of the vote. The by- election for the new mayor was contested by 10 candidates including Labour's John Biggs, Andy Erlam representing Red Flag Anti-Corruption, and Rabina Khan who was elected as a councillor representing Tower Hamlets First in the 2014 election. Khan, who received the backing of Rahman, stood as an independent following the deregistration of Tower Hamlets First. Biggs won the by-election with a total of 32,754 first and second preference votes over Khan 26,384 votes.  Cost proceedings  Following his judgment, Richard Mawrey ordered Lutfur Rahman to pay the petitioners' costs to be assessed on the standard basis if not agreed between the parties. An order for an interim payment of ¬£250,000 to be paid within 14 days was also made pending agreement or assessment of costs, estimated at ¬£500,000. Rahman was also ordered to pay the costs of John Williams, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Metropolitan Police, and expenses incurred in the hosting of the election court. As a result of the costs order, Andy Erlam obtained interim charging orders on two investment properties registered solely in Rahman's name as security for the judgment debt. Rahman's wife Ayesha Farid filed objection to the charging orders claiming absolute beneficial interest on one of the two property, and 74% beneficial interest in the other. Despite the objection, Erlam was able to obtain a final charging order on the second property on 29 June 2015. Additionally, an interim charging order was then secured against a property registered solely in Farid's name on the argument that Rahman has a beneficial interest in it. Due to Lutfur Rahman's failure to pay court cost as ordered, and Ayesha Farid's claims of beneficial interest in their properties, Andy Erlam applied for Rahman's asset to be frozen to prevent dissipation in case Farid's claim is upheld. Knowles J granted Erlam an interim freezing and disclosure order on 29 June 2015, which was extended by Edis J to cover assets worldwide. The disclosure order required Rahman to reveal his worldwide assets, details his income and expenditure for the previous five years, and to produce seven years worth of personal tax returns. A hearing into Ayesha Farid's claim originally set for 30 September 2015 was rescheduled to 1‚Äì3 December. Less than 2 weeks before the December hearings, Lutfur Rahman was declared bankrupt on his own petition. As a result, proceedings in respect to the two properties without a final charging order was stayed pursuant to section 285 of the Insolvency Act 1986. Determination on Farid's claim of 74% beneficial interest on the remaining property continued at the court's discretion. The property was purchased in 2005 with a mortgage in Rahman's name, and all rental payments income and mortgage payments outgoing were handled by Rahman. As part of her evidence, Farid produced a declaration of trust dated May 2006 in support of her claim. On 29 January 2016, chief master Matthew Marsh ruled against Ayesha Farid granting a declaration that Lutfur Rahman holds an absolute beneficial interest in the property under question. In his ruling, Marsh accused Lutfur Rahman, who was not called as a witness by Ayesha Farid of knowingly providing misleading information when making his mortgage application, and failure to declare rental income received to HM Revenue and Customs. Farid was labelled by Marsh as \\"a thoroughly unsatisfactory and unreliable witness\\" with a \\"cavalier attitude to disclosure\\" who was \\"willing to alter and extend her case when challenged\\". In addition to finding that Farid had failed with her evidence to establish a trust on the balance of probabilities, the declaration of trust of May 2006 was also held to be a sham, \\"prepared in order to be available, if needed\\" rather than to reflect the true position. A further cost hearing was scheduled for April 2016. , approximately ¬£290,000 of court cost including interest incurred on the unpaid amount remains outstanding.  Judicial review  The Representation of the People Act 1983 does not provide for decisions of the election court to be challenged. However, in R v Cripps ex parte Muldoon the divisional court of Goff LJ and Mann J decided that decisions of a local election court may be judicially reviewed. An application for permission to bring a judicial review was made by Lutfur Rahman in July 2015, with a hearing held on 26 January 2016. The application was made in the hopes of reducing Rahman incapacity from holding elective office from five years to three years. While maintaining that many of the election court findings are wrong, the application acknowledged that challenges may only be made on those conclusions which amount to error of law. The court findings that canvassers were paid in contravention of section 111 of the 1983 Act, and that Rahman is guilty of bribery personally and by his agent in contravention of section 113 were challenged on the basis that they were reached without any sufficient evidence such that it amounts to an error of law, and that the commissioner erred when interpreting the provision on bribery. A challenge was made to the finding of undue spiritual influence on the basis that the Commissioner conclusion was in contravention to authority, and incompatible with Article 9 or Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, or both. The divisional court of Lloyd LJ and Supperstone J granted Rahman permission to launch a judicial review on the undue spiritual influence finding because the law had not been tested for over a century, but rejected the other two challenges, as a result leaving in place Rahman's five years ban from elective office even if he is successful in a judicial review. The judicial review application was closed following the non-payment of court fee. A renewed application for permission to bring a judicial review was made by Lutfur Rahman in August 2016, after the Metropolitan Police concluded in March 2016 there was insufficient evidence to bring a criminal prosecution. As part of the renewed application, permission to reopen the original judicial review application was sought and granted by Ouseley J. The August 2016 application took the form of an application for permission to amend the grounds of the July 2015 judicial review claim. Three additional grounds for review were sought by Rahman. The first two grounds rely on Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights arguing that the election court findings are incompatible with the presumption of innocence and right to a fair trial, given the subsequent decision of the Metropolitan Police. Permission for those two grounds were rejected by the divisional court with the findings that Rahman was at no point charged with a criminal offence for the purpose of Article 6, and that there were no parallel criminal proceedings alongside civil proceedings of the election court. Permission to include the second ground was additionally denied on the basis of undue delay in raising the issue by Rahman. Under the third ground, Rahman sought a declaratory judgment that the Metropolitan Police decision to discontinue criminal investigation into him constituted an acquittal, and thus triggering the power of a court to order the cessation of the incapacity previously imposed by the election court judgment. Permission was denied based on the earlier finding that Rahman had not been charged, and thus impossible to have been acquitted on a prosecution.  Subsequent developments  Lutfur Rahman was charged by the Solicitors Regulation Authority before the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal in February 2016 of failure to uphold the rule of law and the proper administration of justice, act with integrity, or behave in a way that maintains the trust the public places in him and in the provision of legal services. The hearing into the charges was scheduled to take place between 7‚Äì10 March 2017 but was adjourned pending the determination of Rahman's second application for permission to bring a judicial review of the election court decision. The rearranged hearing started on Monday 18 December 2017 after the tribunal panel rejected an application for adjournment by Rahman filed the previous Friday on the grounds that he could not finance a representative nor feel able to self represent given his inexperience in disciplinary matters. On 20 December 2017, all charges against Rahman were found proven and he was struck off the roll of solicitors along with a costs order of ¬£86,400. After an investigation by the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office, Peter Herbert was reprimanded and given \\"formal advice\\" for his comments implying the election court judgment was tainted by racism. In response to the investigation, Herbert lodged a claim against the Ministry of Justice for race discrimination and victimisation. , Herbert claim for discrimination is ongoing. Attempts was made from the end of 2016 by Lutfur Rahman and his associates including his former deputy Ohid Ahmad to form a new political party named Tower Hamlets Together. Following media reporting of the attempted party formation, Parliamentary Secretary (Minister for the Constitution) Chris Skidmore wrote to the Electoral Commission requesting Tower Hamlets Together's application for registration as a political party to be subject to a \\"forensic review\\". On 23 February 2017, the Electoral Commission rejected the application for registration with the reason that the proposed party name would \\"likely to mislead voters as to the effect of their vote\\", as the name is the same as that of a partnership of local health and social care organisations. A second attempt to form a new political party in January 2018 with the name of Aspire was successful.

According to Italian sources, 503 officers and men (light infantry, 'bersaglieri' in Italian) were killed in the incident, which occurred shortly after the beginning of the Italo-Turkish War. It was the biggest loss of life for Italian troops prior to World War I.  History  The Italian fleet appeared off Ottoman Tripoli on the evening of September 28, 1911; the city was quickly conquered by 1,500 Italian sailors, who were initially welcomed by the population. Despite the quick Italian conquest of the city of Tripoli and surroundings from the Ottoman Empire by the first days of October, the interior of Ottoman Libya shortly broke out into revolt, with Italian authorities losing control over large areas of the region. Indeed, even before the arrival of the Italian forces, cells led by Ottoman officers (called \\"Young Turks\\", like Kemal Atat√ºrk) encouraged native Libyans to infiltrate Italian-owned industries and companies in Tripolitania, reconnoiter roads, and take a census of all males able to bear arms in Tripoli and Derna, in preparation for a jihad of the local Muslims. Even though the Arab (and Jewish) population of the city of Tripoli welcomed the Italians, the interior of Tripolitania rose in revolt from the first weeks and atrocities were committed against the Italian soldiers and civilians by local Muslims (supported by Turkish officers disguised as Arabs), as happened in Shar al-Shatt. The IV Battalion of the 11th Bersaglieri Regiment of Colonel Gustavo Fara had been positioned at the small oasis village as part of the defenses of Tripoli. On October 23 the force of about five hundred soldiers came under attack from the Turks and Arabs and was quickly overrun and decimated. Approximately 290 'bersaglieri' who survived the initial assault surrendered to the jihadists in the local cemetery, but all were tortured and killed. Argentine journalist Enzo D'Armesano of the Buenos Aires newspaper \\"La Prensa\\" was present the next morning in Shar al-Shatt and reported the cruelty with a description that impressed the Argentinian people. He reported that many local civilians approached the Italians' lines from behind, initially showing friendship, only to fall upon them with knives. He wrote that the only three survivors of the 4th Battalion accused the Arab civilians of the Shar al-Shatt oasis of \\"tradimento\\" (betrayal)  Aftermath  Monument in Rome for the Bersaglieri, with Sciara Sciat reference (the first at the top) Officially 21 Italian officers and 482 soldiers died at Shar al-Shatt, 290 of them massacred after surrender in the cemetery One of the opponents of the Italian intervention in Ottoman Libya, the future fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, began to change his initially favorable opinion of the native Libyans after news of the massacre reached Italy. In the late 1920s he remembered (and always cited) the \\"Sciara Sciatt Massacre\\" when he imposed his Pacification of Libya. In 1932 Mussolini inaugurated a monument to the Bersaglieri in Rome, especially honoring those who died at Shar al-Shatt. The monument was designed by architect Italo Mancini and was created by sculptor Publio Morbiducci.

It was a controversy over the papers, paintings and other possessions of John Tweddell, a young barrister and scholar who had died in 1799 in Athens. It was conducted mostly by publications in periodicals and a book by Robert Tweddell, who directed animus for the apparent neglect of the remains at Lord Elgin. William St Clair calls the affair a \\"first-class scandal\\". In the background, the Levant Company had felt that their monopoly on trade around the Aegean Sea had been threatened by Elgin as ambassador in Constantinople, and wished to undermine further such appointments. Background During his travels Tweddell sent home a series of letters. Much of his time was occupied in keeping detailed journals; a large part of them was deposited at Pera, Constantinople with Thomas Thornton, as bulky. Tweddell engaged Michel-Fran√ßois Pr√©aulx, a French artist whom he met at Constantinople, to travel with him in Greece, and to assist him in copying architectural detail in Athens; he also drew for Tweddell on Mount Athos.F.

After Tweddell's death Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin, arriving at Constantinople as ambassador, ordered Tweddell's collections to be sent to him. Tracking the remains Account of the examination of the Elgin-box at the Foreign-Office in Downing-Street, on 7th.November 1816, by Robert Tweddell The subsequent fate of Tweddell's remains is still obscure, but was aired in controversy some years later. Journals and pictures had disappeared, and Tweddell's brother Robert subsequently accused Elgin of appropriating them. Elgin's account of their handling was supported by his chaplain Philip Hunt; his reply to the charges was not published till 1816. Robert Tweddell was supported by Edward Daniel Clarke, by Thornton, and by John Spencer Smith, Elgin's predecessor. Some had in fact been sent home via William Hamilton Nisbet, Elgin's father-in-law, others with Thornton had been lost by fire; and a third collection in a trunk had suffered water damage, were given to Joseph Dacre Carlyle and Hunt to sort, and were lost track of, though on Hunt's account they were sent in a merchant ship. Controversy Thomas Thornton, who had had care of some of Tweddell's remains, mentioned their fate in his The Present State of Turkey (2nd edition, 1809), and was picked up on by an anonymous reviewer (in fact John Spencer Smith, who held a grudge against Elgin), in the Naval Chronicle. Tweddell's brother Robert then pursued the matter. Ranged against Elgin were also Edward Daniel Clarke, whose brother James Stanier Clarke edited the Naval Chronicle, and the Levant Company. Elgin had support in two anonymous (as was customary) articles in the Quarterly Review, a Tory journal that took against Tweddell's liberalism; the first was substantially the work of Charles James Blomfield, the second of John Wilson Croker. Title page of Remains of John Tweddell, a follow up of the earlier publication Account of the examination of the Elgin-box by Robert Tweddell Hunt wrote A Narrative of What Is Known Respecting the Literary Remains of the Late John Tweddell (1816) to support Elgin's self-exculpation in the matter, in reply to The Remains of John Tweddell (1815) issued by Robert Tweddell. He conceded he had copied notes of Tweddell's. Resolution The matter achieved closure when in late 1816 Nisbet turned over drawings sent with him by Elgin to Robert Tweddell. William Richard Hamilton, who had been a private secretary to Elgin in Constantinople, met Robert Tweddell's representatives, John Heys (an undergraduate acquaintance of John Tweddell) and Abraham Moore, at the Foreign Office on 7 November. There were two boxes of pictures that had been returned by Nesbit to Elgin to examine: Tweddell had been provided with copies by Nesbit of pictures of Turkish costumes. A division of the contents of the boxes produced 112 pictures to turn over to Tweddell, with pictures identifiable as by Saverio della Gatta (Xavier Gatta) retained for Elgin; and a minute of the meeting was published.Philip Hunt and A.

Princeton 1885 The season was notable for one of the most celebrated football plays of the 19th century - a 90-yard punt return by Henry \\"Tillie\\" Lamar of Princeton in the closing minutes of the game against Yale. Trailing 5-0, Princeton dropped two men back to receive a Yale punt. The punt glanced off one returner's shoulder and was caught by the other, Lamar, on the dead run. Lamar streaked down the left sideline, until hemmed in by two Princeton players, then cut sharply to the middle of the field, ducking under their arms and breaking loose for the touchdown. After the controversy of a darkness- shortened Yale-Princeton championship game the year before that was ruled \\"no contest,\\" a record crowd turned out for the 1885 game. For the first time, the game was played on one of the campuses instead of at a neutral site, and emerged as a major social event, attracting ladies to its audience as well as students and male spectators. The Lamar punt return furnished the most spectacular ending to any football game played to that point, and did much to popularize the sport of college football to the general public.

Consisting mostly of 18th and 19th-century pianos, it also included a few harpsichords and a few unusual keyboards which defy standard categorisation. It was thought one of the most important collections of historically important keyboard instruments in the world. Some 114 instruments, the balance of the collection, were sold on 7 June 2018 by Canterbury Auction Galleries. https://www.thecanterburyauctiongalleries.com/blog/the-colt-clavier- collection-an-introduction/ saved Jan 16 2019 https://web.archive.org/web/20190116102341/https://www.thecanterburyauctiongalleries.com/blog/the- colt-clavier-collection-an-introduction/ Location The Colt Clavier Collection was located in Bethersden, Kent, housed in a community of demonstration houses built by the Colt family. Most of the instruments were housed in a purpose-built building located next to the corporate business office, but each of demonstration house also features an instrument. A few of the instruments were formerly on loan to museums in Germany and Switzerland. Scope and importance of collection The collection consisted mainly of pianos (forte-pianos), but also included harpsichords and a few clavichords. The Colt Collection contained the largest single accumulation of Broadwood pianos. The oldest specimen dated to 1775, with the most recent instrument dating to the late 19th-century. Consisting in excess of 130 instruments, the collection was one of the largest of its type in England. In addition to actual instruments, the museum displayed numerous images and miscellaneous artefacts related to the history of pianos and their manufacture. History The collection was started in 1944 by Charles F. Colt, whose family fortune came by way of constructing prefabricated housing. Colt began his collection with the purchase of an 1827 Broadwood square piano, which cost the sum of ¬£6. Colt stored these instruments at the village hall in Bethersden, which was built by the Colt family, and it was in Bethersden that Colt resided. Eventually the collection grew to size that storage necessitated using several Colt buildings within the village. Colt acquired specimens that held visual appeal as well as historical significance. Many of the instruments are artistically ornate, although some were acquired because of a decided absence of aesthetic sensibility. In the 1940s, many early pianos had been modified to sound like modern instruments. Those that remained in original condition were considered \\"old fashioned\\" and therefore valued as little more than decoration pieces. These conditions allowed Colt to acquire many of the specimens inexpensively. Piano-maker Derek Adlam was the curator of the collection from 1936 until 1973. A second building built specifically to house specimens was built in the mid-1970s. Although Colt died in 1985, maintenance of the collection continued under the management of Colt's widow and a board of trustees. Construction was underway in 1994 to create more appropriate space for housing the instruments, as many were difficult to access due to area limitations. The Colt Collection maintained a policy of tightly controlled viewing and playing access, largely in response to damage caused by the public to the historical instruments found in the Fenton House. Specimens *Schiedmayer, 1780 *A particularly notable specimen is a \\"claviorganum\\" constructed by Merlin in 1784. This instrument combines the strings and the pipes of an organ, although the strings may be disabled. In appearance it is similar to many of the square pianos housed in the Colt collection. *An 1812 Clementi cottage piano *An 1818 √ârard. *An 1821 Broadwood which had been sent to the Brighton Royal Pavilion. *An 1824 Broadwood, significant in that it contains three iron bars which provide structural reinforcement to the piano frame, during a time in which Broadwood and the √ârard company were in disagreement as to the origination of this development. *An 1827 Broadwood square piano, the first instrument acquired by Colt. *A Graf from the late 1830s. *An 1840 \\"dog-kennel\\" instrument manufactured by Lichtenthal, whose appearance has been described as \\"ghastly.\\" *An 1845 Collard and Collard cabinet piano, with an elaborate rosewood case. *A Joseph Schneider, made approximately 1851. This piano is manufactured out of American bird's eye maple, with a mosaic inlay of wood. It is likely this is the instrument exhibited at the Great Exhibition of 1851. It has simple action, and a warm tone described as \\"feminine\\" in keeping with Viennese standards of the time. *An 1855 √ârard, an early example of a \\"modern\\" instrument with iron frame and action as currently in use in pianos. *An 1868 √ârard. Current status Following concerns about the climate control within the main building, and the proximity of climate-modifying equipment to the instruments, the balance of the collection, some 114 instruments, were sold on 7 June 2018 by Canterbury Auction Galleries. They realised a total of ¬£715,800 (inc premium).https://www.kentonline.co.uk/canterbury/news/rare-piano-auction-hits- right-key-185103/ A number of instruments are now on display at Hammerwood Park, in East Sussex.

His father was a Major in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders and his mother a very talented amateur pianist and accordionist. His parents separated when he was 5 years old, and he and his sister were brought up by their mother, firstly in Edinburgh and then on a farm in Stirlingshire. He was a chorister at St. George‚Äôs Chapel, Windsor and then won a music bursary to Eton College.  Career  Encouraged by his music teacher Boyle studied composition with Frank Spedding at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (now The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland). He also studied piano (with Lawrence Glover), organ (with George McPhee) and harpsichord (with Andrew Davis who, at the time, was associate conductor of the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra) during his studies there. He then went on to win a Caird Scholarship to study privately with Lennox Berkeley in London. As the conductor Nicholas Cleobury wrote in the 1998 Proms programme, ‚ÄúBoyle chose his teachers well: Spedding encouraged his individual voice; Berkeley reduced wastage and honed his orchestration‚Äù. Whilst still a student at the RSAMD Boyle won the BBC Scottish Composers‚Äô Prize with his first orchestral score and further important awards followed. These included two Royal Philharmonic Prizes, as well as the Zaiks Prize in the International Competition set up in memory of Kazimierz Serocki, one of the leading figures in the Polish avant garde, for his orchestral score Winter Music which was premi√®red in Cracow in 1987. His list of works covers most genres and he has received commissions from many societies, festivals and organisations. He has also written for many leading performers including Evelyn Glennie ( Marimba Concerto ), Michael Chance ( Lord Lundy ), Nicholas Daniel ( Oboe Concerto ‚Äì Sorella ), David Hubbard ( Bassoon Concerto ‚Äì That Blessed Wood ), Fine Arts Brass Quintet ( Giochi di Sospiri and Elegy for the Black Bitch ‚Äì nominated for a British Composer Award in 2005), and Karen Cargill ( Watching Over You ). He has collaborated with several writers, including Vikram Seth ( 8 Beastly Tales ), Richard Stilgoe ( Mine Host ), and Dilys Rose ( Kaspar Hauser and Watching over You ). Boyle has written for emerging artists at the start of their careers ‚Äì the pianist James Willshire has premi√®red several of his works and recorded much of Boyle‚Äôs piano music on a critically acclaimed CD.Andrew Clark, \\"review of Rory Boyle Solo Piano Music / Phaethon's Dancing Lesson\\", Financial Times, 23 April 2011Graham Rickson, \\"Classical CDs Weekly: Boyle, Martin, Rachmaninov\\", The Arts Desk, 27 May 2011 He has also written several pieces for the young clarinettist Fraser Langton including the solo piece, Burble , which was nominated for a British Composer Award in 2012. He has also written four operas for children, and in 1998 the National Youth Orchestra of Scotland‚Äôs tour programme included Capriccio , which was performed at venues including the Concertgebouw, Amsterdam and the London Proms. In 2006 Boyle won a Creative Scotland Award to enable him to write an opera with a libretto by the Scottish writer and poet Dilys Rose on the subject of the nineteenth century feral child, Kaspar Hauser. The opera ( Kaspar Hauser, Child of Europe ) was premiered at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland to critical acclaim in March 2010 and, later that year, won for Boyle a British Composer Award in the Stage category at the annual BASCA (British Association of Songwriters Composer and Authors) ceremony in London. The citation of the judging panel read ‚ÄúA very accomplished score: a powerful and disturbing story told with theatrical flair, dramatic pacing and excellent characterisation. The music flows in an uninhibited and unselfconscious stream‚Äù. In April 2012 a second production in association with the Hochschule fur Musik Nurnberg received performances in Germany and Scotland.  Teaching  Boyle has held various teaching posts in England and Scotland. From 1979 to 1988 he was the Director of Music at Walhampton School, Lymington, and from 1988 to 2000, he was the Director of Music at Malvern College in Worcestershire. Since 2000, he has been a tutor at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland and in 2013 he was made a Professor of Composition there.  Film  Boyle has scored several television documentaries and has also worked with the director Murray Grigor writing the music for both Ever To Excel , which was made in 2012 to mark 600 years of St Andrews University, with a narration by Sean Connery, and Beatus, The Spanish Apocalypse , premiered in New York in 2014, which explores the corpus of illuminated and illustrated medieval manuscripts based on the 8th century apocalyptic commentary by the monk, Saint Beatus of Liebana.

Industry Achievements  In early 1992, Villeponteau was recruited as the first senior scientist at Geron Corporation with the goal of cloning the human telomerase genes. Telomerase is a two component enzyme (RNA and protein components) that maintains telomere length, which protects the ends of all chromosomes from damage or dysfunction. Since telomere length tends to shorten with age in humans leading to cellular senescence, telomerase was a potential key factor in promoting human aging from human cancer cells that led to the successful cloning of the first human telomerase gene in early 1994.Feng, J., Funk, W.D., Wang, S.S., Weinrich, S.L., Avilion, A.A., Chiu, C.P., Adams, R.R., Chang, E., Allsopp, R.C., Yu, J., et al.

Functional characterization and developmental regulation of mouse telomerase RNA. Science 269, 1267-1270. Following the RNA component of telomerase cloning, Villeponteau worked on Telomerase Therapeutics at Geron. He helped with the cloning effort that eventually identified the protein component of human telomerase in mid-1997. For the successful human RNA telomerase cloning effort, Villeponteau was the senior scientist in the team of four Geron scientists that won the 1997 Distinguished Inventor Award in Washington DC. His subsequent work at Geron provided more evidence that telomeres and telomerase are significant factors in human aging.Saretzki, G., Feng, J., von Zglinicki, T., and Villeponteau, B. (1998).

Geron's academic collaborators Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider later shared the 2009 Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine with Jack Szostak for their early discovery of how chromosomes are protected by telomeres and the enzyme telomerase. In 1997 Villeponteau proposed the Heterochromatin Loss Model Of Aging, which proposed that the epigenetics of heterochromatin structure plays an important role in aging. Heterchromatin is a repressor of gene expression and its loss leads to inappropriate gene expression with senescence. The model suggests that heterochromatin provides a fundamental epigenetic mechanism that underlies most of the changes in gene expression in senescence. Recent research in Drosophila has supported this heterochromatin loss modelLarson, K., Yan, S.J., Tsurumi, A., Liu, J., Zhou, J., Gaur, K., Guo, D., Eickbush, T.H., and Li, W.X. (2012).

Epigenetics : official journal of the DNA Methylation Society 7, 680-688. From 2002 to 2008, Villeponteau worked for the Reno, NV biotech company Sierra Sciences in several science advisory positions. Sierra Sciences is a biotech company founded by Bill Andrews that develops drugs for telomerase activation and has filed many telomerase-related patents. In 2008 Villeponteau joined Genescient as Vice President of Research. Genescient (an Irvine biotech spinoff of the University of California/UCI that was cofounded by Gregory Benford) uses advanced genomics and machine learning technologies to develop drugs and nutraceuticals for age-related disease.Matsagas, K., Lim, D.B., Horwitz, M., Rizza, C.L., Mueller, L.D., Villeponteau, B., and Rose, M.R. (2009). Long-term functional side-effects of stimulants and sedatives in Drosophila melanogaster. PLoS ONE 4, e6578. At Genescient, Villeponteau worked with UCI professors Michael R. Rose, Larry Mueller, and Anthony Long to understand the genetic difference in long-lived Methuselah flies, which live 3 to 4 times longer than wild-type flies.Rose, M.R., Long, A.D., Mueller, L.D., Rizza, C.L., Matsagas, K.C., Greer, L.F., and Villeponteau, B.

Work with Stem Cells and Formation of Centagen  Geron Corporation was the first company to develop human embryonic stem cell lines in the mid-1990s. As the Champion of Telomerase Therapeutics at Geron, Villeponteau was interested in the status of telomerase in embryonic stem cells. As it turns out, embryonic stem cells have very high levels of telomerase. However, other aspects of embryonic stem cells were not ideal for human therapeutics (e.g. the formation of terotoma cancers), so many scientists and practitioners focused instead on adult stem cells, which do not typically generate tumors. In 2008, Villeponteau formulated a botanical mix that provided telomere support and boosted adult stem cell populations. Extensive work at Genescient showed definitively that the formulation can double maximum Drosophila life span under specific stress conditionsVilleponteau, B., Matsagas, K., Nobles, A.C., Rizza, C., Horwitz, M., Benford, G., and Mockett, R.J. (2015). Herbal supplement extends life span under some environmental conditions and boosts stress resistance. PLoS ONE 10, e0119068. In 2009 Villeponteau cofounded Centagen, which is a biotech company dedicated to developing stem cell technologies that can rejuvenate human adult stem cells from blood, bone marrow, or adipose tissue. Stem cell numbers and/or function decline with age. Many stem cell scientists hypothesize that stem cells hold the key to regenerating youthful function.  References  External links 1.

Photo credit, Fishbase.com and The Native Fish Conservancy The Mangrove gambusia (Gambusia rhizophorae) is a tropical poeciliid (live bearing) fish species with a restricted, disjunct range one in northwestern Cuba, the other in southeastern Florida. The Florida population has been recently listed as \\"biologically vulnerable\\" (vulnerable to extinction because of the taxon‚Äôs biology or other indicators) by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Species description The Mangrove gambusia is a marine fish, typically a resident of sheltered mangrove forests. In Florida, the species is distributed from Fort Lauderdale, south along the mainland coast, and throughout the Florida Keys to Key West. Its distribution in Florida appears to be temperature limited (Getter, 1982). The exact location of the Cuban population is being examined to allow a map of its distribution to be produced. Florida populations of Mangrove gambusia in relation to 17 degree winter isotherm from data of Charles Getter Conservation Habitat destruction for development has reduced available habitats through loss of a number of mangrove forests and formerly occupied sites (Charles Getter, 1976) in Florida. Also contributing to biological vulnerability is the species' limited habitat, temperature restrictions, and hybridization with other species throughout its range (Charles Getter, 1976). One of the largest populations known for the Mangrove gambusia was the lush 100+ acre mangrove forest known as the \\"Cocoplum Islands\\" that were developed into the Cocoplum Development in the mid 1970s. Biology and life history Ongoing research is underway by Dr. Charles Getter, who has studied the species since the 1970s. References *Charles Getter. 1976.

It is the sequel for the 2014 film Timepass. It continues the incomplete lovestory of Dagadu (Rocky) and Prajakta (Praju) also starring Bhalchandra Kadam and Vaibhav Mangle. It is directed by Ravi Jadhav. Synopsis The story takes place after 15 years with grown up Dagadu (Priyadarshan Jadhav) and Praju (Priya Bapat). Young Dagadu (Prathamesh Parab) is a successful music company owner. Dagadu's Friend Bal Bharati is a successful astrologist, Kombda became a DJ working with Dagadu's music company and Malaria became a politician. The movie begins with a scene in which Dagadu donates an ambulance for the people in his area, reflecting his caring attitude. After the event, Dagadu's sister suggests that he marry, showing him photos of some girls. Dagdu hesitates as he is still searching for love. He learns that Prajakta (Priya Bapat) is in Kudal, Konkan. Soon, Prajakta moves to Mumbai to pursue her dreams, however, she still loves Dagadu and is waiting for him to bring her back in his life. Dagadu is still single and waiting for Prajakata, his childhood love. So big question here, whether the childhood love he had was a timepass or something really serious, which is being answered without ambiguity. Dagadu is seen walking in a new avatar suited dressed like an educated guy to impress and win over Shakal. Meanwhile, Praju who seems to have done well in Mumbai seems to be an item girl called Urvashi. Soon, Urvashi turns back into Praju, meeting Dagadu and soon their lost love returns. In later events, Prajakta's father, Shakal wants an educated, qualified guy, unlike Dagadu, to marry his daughter. So Dagadu pretends that he is a Researcher working at Bhabha Atomic Research Center, impressing Shakal. He decides to marry him with his daughter, not knowing that he actually is Dagadu. As Prajakta lives in Mumbai he goes there, traveling in the same Jeep as Dagadu. Shakal searches for her, in the apartment, finding that his daughter has changed her name to Urvashi. Her friend tells Shakal that she has gone for a shoot. Hence, Shakal goes to the location of shoot, finding that his daughter is dancing for an Item Dance Video in too short clothes. After watching the dance, he is broken completely. He runs to slap her, but Dagadu, stops him, asking him to cool down, but Shakal loses his temper, slaps her and brings her outside the hall. Shakal is completely broken and returns to Kudal. Dagadu, doubting his love, wondering if their relationship was just a waste of time (Timepass) and asks his friends for advice. Kombda advises him to let go Prajakta, but the teenaged Dagadu in his mind reminds him of their true love, then Dagadu decides to marry no one except Prajakta.

It was signed on 29 June 2005.  Overview  In 2005, both nations signed the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) and have organised the India-Singapore Parliamentary Forum and the Singapore-India Partnership foundation with active support from the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICC), the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and the Singapore Business Federation to promote trade, economic development and partnerships. The CECA eliminated tariff barriers, double taxation, duplicate processes and regulations and provided unhindered access and collaboration between the financial institutions of Singapore and India. The CECA also enhanced bilateral collaboration related to education, science and technology, intellectual property, aviation and allowed Indian professionals in information technology, medicine, engineering and financial fields. Singapore has invested in projects to upgrade India's ports, airports and developing information technology parks and a Special Economic Zone (SEZ). India has become Singapore's 4th biggest tourist destination and more than 650,000 Indians visited Singapore in 2006. Both nations have worked to collaborate on aviation, aerospace engineering, space programmes, information technology, biotechnology and energy. In response to claims that surfaced in early 2016 that Singapore had backtracked on its commitment on CECA by blocking Indian IT professionals seeking work visas, and that India had put on hold further liberation of trade in response, a spokesman from India‚Äôs Commerce Ministry confirmed that India had not put the CECA on hold and it continued (to be) in force. Singapore also said it had not received any official notification from the Indian government that the review of the CECA had been put on hold. Singapore and India successfully concluded the second review of the India- Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) on 1 June 2018 in the presence of India Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. It allows for the movement of four types of business people between Singapore and India. The second review of CECA was concluded with no change to the chapter on movement of people. In September 2018, India and Singapore formally launched the third review of CECA which focuses on trade facilitation, e-commerce and customs. Controversies The CECA has become a point of grievance for Singaporeans who believe that a high influx of Indian professionals has stolen their jobs and is crowding out our society. On the public facebook group SG Opposition, Michael da Silva said the government was allowing Indian Professionals to achieve citizenry and eventually gain their vote for the ruling party. These worries have become more pronounced as Singapore battles its worst recession and countries around the world continue struggling to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. While Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) released a statement identifying that Singaporeans are ‚Äúunderstandably concerned‚Äù with competition from foreign professionals, managers and executives (PMEs) due to the current bleak economy and employment situation. However, it is ‚Äúmisleading‚Äù to assert that the number of Indian PMEs, especially intra-corporate transferees, solely or largely to CECA. MTI also refuted that ‚ÄúNone of our free trade agreements, including Ceca, obliges us to automatically grant Employment Passes to any foreign national.‚Äù Additionally, ‚ÄúAll foreign nationals applying for Employment Passes must meet our prevailing criteria, and all companies must comply with rules on fair hiring‚Äù. Despite Government‚Äôs clarification on the matter, netizens remain sceptical about the free trade agreement between Singapore and India. The topic of FTAs and CECA was debated during the 2020 Singaporean general elections between both the governing People's Action Party (PAP) and various opposition parties. Tan Cheng Bock, a former People's Action Party's Member of Parliament and founder of the Progress Singapore Party (PSP), campaigning in the elections as a PSP politician, promised to call for the review of CECA if elected, especially on one of the terms which allows the free movement of Indian workers in at least 127 sectors to enter and work in Singapore. In 2020, Leong Mun Wai, as a Non-constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP), spoke in Parliament, mentioning as to how \\"deeply disappointed\\" he was that DBS Bank, a Singaporean multinational bank, did not have a \\"home-grown\\" Singaporean-born chief executive as the bank's CEO, Piyush Gupta, was an Indian national when appointed but only became a Singapore citizen shortly thereafter, making him a beneficiary of CECA. Leong was subsequently rebutted by Minister for Communications and Information S. Iswaran and Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung on the merits of his speech.

Early life Paddy Murphy was born in the rural community of Fiach Roe in the musically rich heartland of west County Clare (Ireland). His music developed during a time of unprecedented change in Irish society. Emigration from the Irish countryside was reaching critical mass, but Murphy chose to remain at home on a mountainy farm. During the next fifty years, he would become one of the most celebrated concertina players in Ireland, responsible for developing a unique fingering system and for passing on his skills to a new and eager generation of teachers and performers. He was greatly influenced by the recordings of William J. Mullaly, the first Irish concertina player to record commercially during the Golden Age of Irish music in America in the 1920s. Contributions One of the first Clare musicians to broadcast on Radio √âireann, Murphy was also a competitive concertina player. His victory at the 1954 All Ireland Fleadh Cheoil na h√âireann in Cavan marked the first appearance of the concertina in a national music competition. Uilleann piper Willie Clancy lauded him as Ireland's 'finest concertina player'. Paddy Murphy is best remembered for pioneering a unique system of cross-row fingering. This original approach facilitated the use of alternative scales for traditional dance tunes in keys that were largely unfamiliar to most of his peers in the 1940s and 1950s. He was also a gifted teacher and his students included Gear√≥id √ì hAllmhur√°in, Noel Hill, Gerald Haugh and Miriam Collins.

A program transformation is any operation that changes the computational structure such as nature and type of computational models, their interconnections, sequencing of operations keeping the input output behavior intact. We basically use Operation reduction to reduce the number of operations to be done to perform a task which reduces the hardware required and in turn power consumption. For example, in a given Application specific IC reducing the number of independent additions required automatically reduces the adders required and also the power consumed.  Operation Substitution  Operation Substitution is one of the operation reduction techniques where certain costly operations are substituted by relatively cheaper operations which reduce power consumption. Some typical examples of operation substitution techniques are given as follows: #Multiplication by Adds/Subtracts: The multiplication of two numbers if costly compared to addition of two numbers therefore substituting it with addition is profitable. For example, to calculate y = x2 + Ax + B we can calculate x2, Ax, and add both of them to B which has 2 multiplications, 3 additions or we can convert it into y = x(x+A) + B where we can calculate x+A multiply it with x and add B where we have 1 multiplication and 2 additions, both approaches have same critical path length but 2nd one has lesser multiplications which saves power. #Computation of Sine/cosine/tan: Computing trigonometric functions might also turn out to be quite costly where as substituting them with lesser order Taylor expansion makes them less power consuming but we may lose on approximation grounds which is a trade-off one should keep in mind. #Multiply-add by MAC: Multiply‚Äìaccumulate operation is a common step that computes the product of two numbers and adds that product to an accumulator. The hardware used for this purpose is called multiplier‚Äìaccumulator (MAC). Using MAC's also decrease the power consumed. Basically a MAC does multiplication and addition in one unit. a leftarrow a + ( b times c ) #Reducing Memory Access: Changing the structure of the program by replacing the operations which require frequent memory access with those need less memory access is also profitable as memory access is a costly operation.  Butterfly Example  A popular example of Operation substitution is Butterfly example. In this example we need to compute two values yr = ar * xr  ai * xi, yi = ai * xr + ar * xi which can be done sequentially computing the terms as shown in the expressions. But using operation substitution we can compute them using expressions, yr = ar* (xi+xr) - xi * (ai+ar), yi = ar* (xi+xr) + xr * (ai-ar) where the term (xi+xr) once computed can be used by both the computations from this we can easily workout that operations changed from number of operations changed from 4 multiplications to 3 and 2 Add/sub to 3. The critical path in the first method was of length 2 where as in the latter it is 3. So again this is a trade-off between delay and power.  Switching Activity Reduction  Based on the frequency of input changing we can model the program so that less activity switching happens i.e. if certain inputs are less frequently changing then they should be made operating in single module so that the particular module is relatively passive compared to others. A+B+C+D can be computed as (A+B)+C+D or (A+B)+(C+D) the first one feeds C,D to 2 separate adders but if they are relatively slow changing then feeding them to same adder is more profitable.  Power Aware Scheduling and Binding Any synthesis has 3 parts Allocation(number and type of resources), Scheduling(operation scheduling), Binding(building the circuit). We can schedule the operations in a particular order based which value in the program activates how many modules. We always want the operations requiring more operations to be completed before hand to be scheduled later.  Exploiting Mutual Exclusion  Consider the following code snippet: if(C>0){ :A = A*C } Let us assume that the profiling has shown that most likely the value of C is 2. Therefore, as C and A are independent and mutually exclusive we can modify the code to be if (c = = 2) A = A << 1 else If (C >0){ :A = A * C; } Here the multiplication is replaced by shifting operation which is triggered in most of the cases and is far cheaper than multiplication.

The area of the park is , of which is the area where any economic activity is prohibited. The park is located in the highest part of the Ukrainian Carpathians, on the eastern slopes in the drainage basins of the Prut River and the Black Cheremosh River. The Prut has its source in the park, and the highest point of Ukraine, Mount Hoverla (), is located at the borders of the park. The lowest point of the park is about . In 1921, in the highest part of the Ukrainian Carpathians a nature reservation was created which originally had the area of . In 1968, it was merged into the newly created Carpathian State Reserve. Carpathian National Nature Park was established in 1980 by the decree of the Council of Ministers of Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, and included about a half of the area which previously belonged to the Carpathian State Reserve. The park is an independent unit subordinated to the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources of Ukraine. Ecoregion and climate The park is in the Carpathian montane forests ecoregion. Because of its altitude, the climate of the Carpathian Park is Subarctic climate, without dry season (K√∂ppen climate classification Subartic climate (Dfc)). This climate is characterized by mild summers (only 1‚Äì3 months above ) and cold, snowy winters (coldest month below ).

The three most common tree species in the park are silver fir, European beech, and spruce. The Huk Waterfall, located within the park, is the highest single-drop waterfall in the Ukrainian Carpathians (). There are two lakes of glacial origin. Public use The area of the Carpathian National Nature Park was historically inhabited by hutsuls and contains a number of monuments of history and architecture, including historical wooden buildings.

Stephen was indentured to Harman Fagan with the promise that Stephen would be permitted to attend school at least three months a year..‚ÄùBelle Paxson Drury, p. 18 However Stephen had been born with a speech impediment and was dubbed ‚ÄúStuttering Stephen.‚Äù Because of his stutter, he never attended school.Wesley R. Willis, 200 Years‚ÄîAnd Still Counting! Past, Present and Future of the Sunday School, (Wheaton, IL:Victor Books, Scripture Press, 1980), p. 49 On the first day, he was so excited that he could not get out his name or age. The children laughed, and the teacher returned him home with a note saying not to come back until he could talk. He never did receive a formal education, but he was inquisitive and determined, so despite having to work constantly, he taught himself to read.Belle Paxson Drury, p. 18 He was also crippled and lame throughout life, living in constant pain. He became a hatmaker and a favorite fiddler for local Saturday night dances. Conversion Paxson was not a churchgoer nor a professing Christian in early life, but when he was in his 30s, his daughter Mary begged him to attend church to help her win a gold star. He agreed to get close enough to only put his foot in the door, hoping he would be counted for Mary's prize, but when he got to the door, Mary pulled him inside. They needed a teacher, and Paxson was pressed into service. The students read from the Bible and Paxson asked questions out of a book. Paxson returned. At first he thought he was a moral man who had no need of salvation, Christ or the church, but after four years of thinking about the instruction in the Sunday school book, he was personally converted to Christ.Lorella Rouster, Stephen Paxson‚ÄîSingle-Minded Apostle to Pioneer Children, Testimonies of Faith, Sunday School Times/Gospel Herald (Cincinnati, OH:Union Gospel Press, p. 28 Ministry with American Sunday School Union After his conversion in Sunday school, his enthusiasm knew no bounds. Soon he quit his job as a hatmaker, the family sold their home in Winchester, Illinois and moved to a simple log cabin home on Hickory Hill in Pike County,Willis, p. 51 so that he could become a Sunday school missionary. His salary was one dollar a day.Rouster, p. 28 Highly motivated, Paxson worked on overcoming his handicaps. He learned to walk without showing his discomfort and overcame stuttering by practicing taking a deep breath and then expelling it slowly, accompanied by hand gesturers.Willis, p. 51 Traveling on horseback, Paxson traveled and ministered in an area stretching from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico and from the Allegheny Mountains to the Rockies. He made a habit of always stopping to visit every child he met, hoping to persuade him to come to Sunday school. This habit became so ingrained that his horse learned to stop whenever a child was in sight. Because of this, he has been called ‚Äúthe Apostle to the children‚Äù (Willis, p. 50) He kept his mind of the goal of establishing a Sunday school in every community, and he seized virtually every opportunity, talking to parents, town leaders, and children. His horse, it is said, automatically turned in at every school and church without command.Rouster, p.28 During the winter months, travel was impossible on the frontier, so Paxson used those times to visit the larger towns of the East, seeking to start Sunday schools in each community there, and raising funds for the work of the American Sunday School Union, in particular for furnishing mini-libraries of Sunday school books for frontier communities at half cost.Rouster, p. 28 This was no idle time. Paxson spoke five nights a week and three to five times on Sunday.Belle Paxson Drury, p. 106 Paxson, hardened to pain through his physical infirmities, endured through many hardships. He traveled roads that could barely be called such, over 100,000 miles by horseback in his lifetime. He traveled in all kinds of weather. One of his favorite sayings was, ‚ÄúA Sunday school born in a snowstorm will never be scared by a white frost.‚ÄùB. PaxsonDrury, A Fruitful Life: A Narrative of the Adventurers and Missionary Labors of Stephen Paxson ( American Sunday School Union) He had no guaranteed accommodations in his travels. He also endured the hardship of separation from his family for long periods. However, his wife was capable, loving and devoted, and cared well for the children during these absences.Willis, p.59 The Sunday schools he started were Union Sunday schools in which many Christian denominations participated, studying the Bible together.Willis, p. 50 His ministry was extremely fruitful. He once set a record of starting forty new Sunday schools in forty days! His ministry extended forty years through two generations and brought thousands to faith in Christ. It is said that one man moved twice in an effort to avoid Paxson and his Sunday schools. When Paxson showed up at the third place to which he had moved, however, he came to hear his lecture and was so moved that he enrolled himself and his seven sons in the Sunday school and gave the first donation toward a Sunday school library.Willis, p. 52 Later life and death In his later years, Paxson retired to the home office of the American Sunday School Union in St. Louis.http://www.believersweb.org/view.cfm?ID=149 There, he was placed in charge of the Sunday School Book Depository which fulfilled orders for the mini-libraries for which he had so often raised funds. He was very strict about orders being fulfilled the same day they were received. While in St. Louis, he and his family attended Pilgrim Congregational Church and he continued to invite every child he saw to Sunday school.Belle Paxson Drury, p. 146‚Äì147, 149. He also wrote to encourage Sunday school conventions whenever he could not attend.Belle Paxson Drury, p. 153 In October 1880, the Paxsons recelebrate their marriage of 50 years at their home in St. Louis.Belle Paxson Drury, p. 171. Paxson spent time making scrapbooks of his labors and writing letters of encouragement to others.Belle Paxson Drury, p. 180 Paxson was invalid the last three months of his life. Several days before his death, when it was evident he would not recover, his son, Rev. W.P. Paxson asked him if he should die, if it was all right. Paxson replied, ‚ÄúWhy son, that was settled many years ago.‚ÄùBelle Paxson Drury, p. 181 He left this message to friends: ‚ÄúI die at my post. All is clear and bright and peaceful. No fear, no tremor, but rest, comfort in God.‚ÄùBelle Paxson Drury, p. 181 He died at home in 1881. Legacy In his lifetime, Paxson directly started 1300 frontier Sunday schools and aided in the establishment of 1700 others.Willis, p. 63 Paxson's oldest son, at age 15 joined in his father's missionary work. He went on to establish more than 700 more Sunday schools himself. Paxson has been called ‚Äúthe most important single influence in evangelizing the American frontier.Wesley R.

Yeti specializes in products such as ice chests, vacuum-insulated stainless-steel drinkware, soft coolers, and related accessories. History Roy and his older brother Ryan Seiders grew up in Driftwood, Texas, and spent their entire childhood outdoors. With their father (Roger Seiders) being an entrepreneur that designed a fishing rod epoxy, the brothers would get to see up close how to be successful with your own business. Ryan graduated from Texas A&M; University in 1996 and Roy graduated from Texas Tech University in 2000. In 2006, Ryan started Waterloo Rods (Waterloo being the original name for Austin, Texas) and sold the company nine years later. Roy, an angler and hunter, began his career making custom boats that were designed for fishing in shallow depth areas on the Texas Gulf Coast after graduating from Texas Tech.The avid outdoorsmen became frustrated with the quality of the coolers available and founded YETI that same year to invent their own high-end cooler in response. In June 2012, two-thirds stake of the company was purchased by private equity firm Cortec Group for $67 million. In July 2016, the company filed with the Security and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering with plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the \\"YETI\\" symbol. The company was seeking a valuation of $5 billion and hoped to raise $100 million, but retracted the IPO two years later, in March 2018, citing \\"market conditions\\". As of January 8, 2018, Yeti still was a sponsor of the PBR and the YETI ‚ÄúBuilt for the Wild‚Äù event. In April 2018, the National Rifle Association, via its National Rifle Association Institute for Legislative Action, announced that YETI refused to be a vendor. The NRA then dropped YETI as its official supplier of coolers. This led to a backlash from NRA members, leading some to destroy YETI products they had already purchased. In response to the NRA's comment, Yeti contacted The Washington Post and said that the NRA's comment was \\"inaccurate\\" and that neither the NRA nor the NRA's Foundation was targeted, and other organizations were also included in the removal of a ‚Äúgroup of outdated discounting programs‚Äù. On October 25, 2018, YETI became a public company via an initial public offering of 16 million shares at a price of $18 per share.  Products  The company targets niche markets of high-end hunting and fishing enthusiasts, outdoors-men, beach goers, and water enthusiasts. YETI sponsored professional outdoors-men and hunting and fishing shows. Products range in price substantially, some upwards of $500.  Coolers  Yeti Hopper bag YETI's \\"Tundra\\" series of coolers ranges from 20 quarts to 350 quarts. The Tundra line can be locked with two padlocks, making it certified bear-resistant according to the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee. YETI also makes soft-sided coolers called the \\"Hopper\\" series. The \\"Hopper\\" series coolers are designed to be lightweight and more transportable than standard YETI coolers. YETI is known for its expensive coolers. They have an 82-gallon cooler that is their most expensive one, that sells for $1,300. YETI has many other products besides the coolers but this is what they are best known for. The idea of these coolers was founded by the Seiders brothers: two outdoorsmen who felt there were not any coolers that could keep their catch, kills, and beverages cold for a longer period of time. The brothers teamed up with a factory in the Philippines to create an \\"indestructible cooler\\", with superior ice retention.  Other products  Yeti Rambler Mug (14oz) YETI sells drink-ware products under the \\"Rambler\\" line ranging from 10 ounces to one gallon in size. The company also makes an ice bucket called the \\"YETI Tank\\".  Sales  YETI sells their products to select retailers such as Academy Sports and Outdoors, Bass Pro Shops and other retailers to include Amazon Marketplace, West Marine, Cabela's, REI, and Dicks Sporting Goods. YETI's sales increased from $147.7 million in 2015 to $468.9 million in 2016. YETI‚Äôs earnings in 2015 were $14.2 million and in 2016 were $72.2 million.

Legendary Whitetails was established in 1999 as a direct-to-consumer catalog and internet retailer, and is headquartered in Apopka, Florida.  History  Legendary Whitetails was founded in 1999 by Larry Huffman. Huffman was an avid outdoorsman, hunter and conservationist. He served as president of the Wisconsin chapter of Safari Club International and as a regional vice president. He served as a representative to the Wisconsin Conservation Congress. Larry, along with fellow authors and deer enthusiasts Dick Idol, David Morris, and Gordon Whittington compiled stories about the 40 world-class bucks that made up Larry's original collection. The original book is titled Legendary Whitetails. Legendary Whitetails II was published in 2001 and Legendary Whitetails III was published in 2007. In 1999, Larry started the Iowa Deer Classic. Currently, the Iowa Deer Classic takes place every year in Des Moines, Iowa. The popularity of the Legendary Whitetails collection amongst the hunting community motivated Larry to create a unique line of merchandise designed specifically as everyday apparel for white-tailed deer hunters and their families. Founder, Larry Huffman died in 2007. In 2019, the company filed for Chapter 128 Receivership in Washington County Circuit Court on March 4. The company was sold and operations moved to Florida in May 2019.  The ‚ÄúLegendary Whitetails‚Äù collection  The Legendary Whitetail collection contained over 84 trophy white-tailed deer mounts ranked in the Boone and Crockett Club and/or Pope and Young record books. The collection included several of the most notable trophies in the world, including the James Jordan Buck and the Hole in the Horn Buck. It was founder of Legendary Whitetails, Larry Huffman's, dream to someday display the collection in a public museum. When Bass Pro Shops proposed to buy the entire collection and place the mounts on permanent display for the public to enjoy at Bass Pro headquarters in Springfield, Missouri, Larry liked the idea of having the collection on public display. Larry sold the Legendary Whitetail collection to Bass Pro Shops on September 16, 2002. The deer mounts are now part of Bass Pro Shops ‚ÄúKing of Bucks‚Äù collection and are on display at the American National Fish and Wildlife Museum in Springfield, Missouri. The ‚ÄúKing of Bucks‚Äù collection also goes on tour occasionally. During tours, the collection is transported and displayed in seven separate semi-trailer exhibits.  Products  The Legendary Whitetails brand was established with the release of the 1999 catalog, deeming product as the ‚ÄúOriginal Deer Gear‚Äù. The catalog, along with the ecommerce website are the primary channels of business. The product line includes a men's line, women's line, kids‚Äô apparel, Big and Tall sizing, footwear, home, hunting, and auto product categories. The Hunt Bum apparel line was added in 2013 and is designed specifically for active outdoorsmen. Female interest levels for the sport of hunting and hunting related apparel, including camouflage, have been on the rise since the early 2000s. The women's line is the fastest growing segment of Legendary Whitetails. Legendary Whitetails‚Äô primary market consists of deer hunters and their families, thus, many items incorporate camouflage design elements within the product. Legendary Whitetails utilizes five individual camouflage brands with over 20 unique camouflage patterns and styles to design products.

Blake was born in Brooklyn, New York on January 21, 1842. He graduated from Harvard College in 1862, and from Harvard Divinity School in 1866. He served as pastor in several Unitarian churches in Massachusetts and Illinois. He died in Chicago on April 28, 1925.

According to a contemporary report, he exhibited cool presence of mind when a serious fire broke out during a service. He was the last to leave the building, which by that time was full of smoke. Seconds later, it burst into flames and was consumed. He published many essays on religious and other subjects, sermons, poems, and plays. Notably, he collaborated with Frederick Lucian Hosmer and William Channing Gannett in the compilation and editing of Unity Hymns and Chorals for the Congregation and the Home (1880), an influential hymnbook which was reprinted several times. It includes several of his own hymns. A revised edition was issued in 1911. While pastor at Evanston, he penned a Covenant which has been adopted by many Unitarian Congregations: Love is the spirit of this church, and service is its law. United in the free quest of high values in religion and life, We covenant with one another: To dwell together in peace, to seek the truth in love, and to help one another.''

Early years Hogue was born in Dallas, Texas in August 1969. Her family is Jewish. She graduated from high school at Greenhill School in Addison, Texas before attending Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York, where she studied environmental sciences. She attended graduate school at the University of Michigan and then later worked as a research assistant at the University of Montana. At Vassar, she engaged in her first political work in April 1989 when she joined the March for Women's Lives, a demonstration focused on reproductive rights. Career Hogue joined NARAL in January 2013. When assuming the role of president, some commentators remarked on her relative youth compared to her sexagenarian predecessor (she was 43 at the time) as an intentional choice on the part of NARAL as it sought to bring a more aggressive approach to defending abortion rights and courting younger supporters. One of her first moves as president was to build coalitions within the progressive movement with groups that traditionally had little to do with reproductive rights. She has also brought an increased focus on ballot measures, partly in an attempt to force opponents to define what they are in favor of while giving Americans who support abortion rights a platform. Following a shooting which occurred at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado in 2015, The Huffington Post reported on a Facebook post of Hogue's in which she was critical of the rhetoric of anti- abortion activists including David Daleiden and Troy Newman. Prior to her work for NARAL, Hogue worked for MoveOn.org, Greenpeace, Rainforest Action Network, Media Matters for America, and the Friends of Democracy PAC, a campaign- finance reform group founded by Jonathan Soros. She serves on the board of Bend the Arc: A Jewish Partnership for Justice, a Jewish social organization. On November 15, 2016, Hogue announced she was considering running in the Democratic National Committee chairmanship election, 2017. She ultimately decided not to enter the race.

Biography Vincent Crapanzano graduated from the Ecole Internationale in Geneva, received his A.B. in philosophy from Harvard in 1960 and his PhD in anthropology from Columbia in 1970. From 1961 to 1964, conscripted, he served in the U.S. Army, first at the Army Language School in Monterey and then in Frankfurt/Main.He has taught at Princeton, Harvard, the University of Chicago, the University of Paris (Nanterre), the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, also in Paris, the University of Brasilia, and the University of Cape Town. He is the author of nine books, numerous papers and reviews in academic journals, as well as in The New Yorker, the New York Times, The Times Literary Supplement, and The Washington Post. Many of these have been translated into a broad range of languages or written in French. He has lectured at major universities and research centers in North and South America, Europe, North Africa, Lebanon, Hong Kong, and South Africa. He has been the recipient of numerous grants and awards, including those from the Rockefeller and Guggenheim foundations, and the Fulbright Program (Brazil). He was a Sherman-Fairchild Distinguished Scholar at the California Institute of Technology, a fellow at the American Academy in Berlin, a Jensen Memorial lecturer at the Frobenius Institute in Frankfurt, the President of the Society for Psychological Anthropology from which he received a Life Time Award. He has done fieldwork with the Navajo, the Hamadsha (a Moroccan Sufi order or tariqa), and White South Africans during apartheid, Christian Fundamentalists and legal conservatives in the United States, and the Harkis (those Algerians who served as auxiliary troops for the French during the Algerian war of independence). Work and thoughts Crapanzano is an eclectic thinker, a firm believer in rigorous interdisciplinary studies, and severe critique of disciplinary parochialism. He prefers to speak not of anthropology but anthropologies. He often refers to cultural anthropology as a philosophical discipline, at least one that can serve as a corrective to the ethnocentrism of academic philosophy. Once, when asked how he would differentiate anthropology from sociology, he referred to anthropology as a science of the intimate. In many of his ethnographic works, he focuses on the individual, in his early works from a psychoanalytic perspective, later from a dialectical one, and more recently from a critical phenomenological one that stresses inter-subjectivity. He recognizes phenomenology‚Äôs inherent limitations, which stem from its embeddedness in a particular language ‚Äìits language of description‚Äî and, Husserl notwithstanding, from the threat posed by the possibility of solipsism and the stress on the opacity of the other characteristic of the epistemologies of modernity. He argues that as social actors we are destined to be bad epistemologists insofar as we have to assume, rightly or wrongly, that we can intuit what the other is thinking and feeling. He does recognize the possibility of other epistemologies; say those of the heart, which are not haunted by what transpires in the mind of the other. Though he had been considered a cultural relativist of a postmodern bent, he in fact advocates a heuristic relativism ‚Äì one which brackets, as best one can, one's own cultural presuppositions, as one engages with other worldviews. He relates this stance to the way Keats referred to as negative capability. Ideally it furnishes one with a critical perspective on both one's own worldview and that of one's informants. But, underlying his thought is an at times pessimistic skepticism, which is tempered by irony. Irony, he claims, is sorely missing from the social sciences. Field work It was Crapanzano‚Äôs experience in Morocco, working with the spirit possessed, that led him to question some of the fundamental presuppositions of psychoanalysis. In describing his interviews with an illiterate Moroccan tile maker, Tuhami, after whom he named one of his books, considered by many to be his most important, he came to realize how life stories and by extension other ethnographic findings are reformulated by the anthropologist in accordance with literary genre and conventions, rendering them more familiar but losing their unique cultural framing. This led him to consider the role of writing in anthropology generally and was one of the founders of what came to be known as the writing culture school of anthropology. It also led him to a close reading of several of Freud‚Äôs case histories from a linguistic point of view, demonstrating how, for example, attributions of transference and countertransference were refractions of such linguistic functions as the pragmatic and the metapragmatic, that is the way speech figures its context and itself. Many of these articles were collected in Hermes‚ÄôDilemma and Hamlet‚Äôs Desire. There has always been a split between Crapanzano‚Äôs theoretical interests and his ethnographic writing, which is deeply rooted in fieldwork experience and literary form. Challenged by ethical relativism, he studied white South Africans at the height of apartheid. He found something ingenuous about the way in which anthropologists seemed always to focus on the downtrodden in their research on domination. In his book, Waiting: The Whites of South Africa, a study of a village in the Cape Province, which he called Wyndal, he argued that the two dominant white populations, the English- speakers and the Afrikaners, were caught in a dialectic imbroglio in which they each felt so wounded by the other that, though they talked about an imminent bloodbath, they tended to ignore the ‚Äúreality‚Äù of the non-whites. Even the liberal whites who were opposed to apartheid rarely considered the subjective life of the victims of apartheid. Though privileged, the whites themselves were entrapped within apartheid system. During his research in Wyndal, a conservative evangelical revival occurred among the whites, offering solace and escape to those without international connection and the possibility of flight in the event of a bloodbath. This probably led him to turn his attention to Christian Fundamentalists and legal conservatives in the United States. In From the Pulpit to the Bench, he argued that literalism, was prevailing interpretive style in America, extending well beyond the fundamentalists and the legal conservatism of Bork, Scalia and their ilk to popular understanding of DNA and trauma-centered psychotherapies. Unfortunately, he did not investigate latter. He noted ironically that while the academy was focused on the postmodern future of simulacra and semantical skidding, conservative evangelicalism was on the rise. Perhaps in reaction to the constraints of the Fundamentalists‚Äô dogged literalism and fear of the imagination and figurative language (at least Crapanzano claims), he focused his Jensen lectures in Frankfurt on the creative play of the imagination, which were published in his book Imaginative Horizons. Here, as in his other books, he experimented with literary form, juxtaposing unconnected texts and events in order to produce in his readers the tension of the gap ‚Äì the betwixt and between ‚Äì between these texts and events. Upon completing Imaginative Horizons, Crapanzano began doing research with the Harkis living in France. In The Wound that Never Heals and other publications, he considered the effect of betrayal and abandonment on the lives of the Harkis and their children and grandchildren, living in the very country that had in their eyes (and not without reason) betrayed and abandoned them.[4] He argued that so significant was the wound they shared that they subsumed their personal histories, their identities, to the Harki story. He referred to this story as a frozen discourse which, entrapping some, particularly the Harkis themselves, was a constant reference point for even those Harkis who adapted, some with considerable success, to France. He considered the role of forgiveness, destiny, and a sense of being owed (for the sacrifices the Harkis made for France and the losses they suffered) in their self-understanding. The picture Crapanzano drew was less tragic (though it was tragic) than pessimistic. He himself admits that this picture was tinged with his own pessimistic tendencies. Memoir Given Crapanzano‚Äôs stress on the individual, life histories, and the importance of self-reflection and self-positioning in anthropological research, it seems inevitable that he would turn to the consideration of his own life experiences. In Recapitulations, a self- reflective memoir ‚Äì some have called it a meta-memoir ‚Äì he reflects on the existential implications of both insignificant and significant events in his own life.[5] Taking ironic pleasure in the paradoxes in his life and by implication in the life of others, his self-questioning seems also to be questioning of the very questions he poses. In this way he leads his readers to question what they themselves take for granted in their own lives. Here, as in so much of Crapanzano‚Äôs writing, his intentions are tempered by his irony.

It was written by Her Majesty's Civil Service, led by Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell, and was published by the Cabinet Office on 14 December 2010. The Manual gives an overview of the UK's system of government, reflecting the importance of Parliament, Cabinet government and the democratic nature of the UK‚Äôs constitutional arrangements by explaining the powers of the Executive, Sovereign, Parliament, international institutions (most notably the European Union), the Crown Dependencies, British Overseas Territories and the devolved administrations in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The Manual was written as a guide for members of Cabinet, other ministers and civil servants in the execution of government business, but also serves to consolidate many of the previously unwritten constructional conventions through which the British government operates. The writing of the Manual was originally initiated by Gordon Brown as part of his broader plan to establish a written constitution for the UK. However, in 2011 the House of Lords Constitution Committee stated that the document was \\"not the first step to a written constitution\\" as it only describes the existing rules and does not \\"set existing practice in stone\\". The Manual does not need to be formally approved by Parliament and can be modified at any time by the Cabinet Secretary. History The United Kingdom has no single constitutional document; instead, much of the British constitution is embodied in documents, within statutes, court judgments, works of authority and treaties, which is sometimes described as an uncodified or \\"unwritten\\" constitution.H Barnett, Constitutional and Administrative Law (5th edn Cavendish 2005) 9, \\"A written constitution is one contained within a single document or a [finite] series of documents, with or without amendments\\" The UK constitution also has several unwritten sources in the form of constitutional conventions. In February 2010 during a speech to the Institute for Public Policy Research, Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced that he had asked Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell to \\"consolidate the existing unwritten, piecemeal conventions that govern much of the way central government operates under our existing constitution into a single written document\\". Sir Gus and his team in the Cabinet Office travelled to New Zealand, which uses the Westminster system of government and also lacks a codified constitution. Using the New Zealand Cabinet Manual as precedent, the Cabinet Office published a draft Cabinet Manual for the UK in December 2010 which was scrutinised by the House of Lords Constitution Committee, the House of Commons Political and Constitutional Reform Committee and the Public Administration Select Committee. Following recommendations by the Parliamentary Committees, a finalised version was published in October 2011 with forewords by David Cameron and Sir Gus O'Donnell.

Marketing  In 2015, Lucky Buddha Beer was one of the fastest growing import beer brand in supermarkets in the United States. The bottle design depicts a Laughing Buddha. This is a cultural design depicted that is incorporated in Buddhist, Taoist and Shinto traditions. The Lucky Buddha Beer bottle is modeled as the seated laughing Buddha holding a large gold ingot above his head. The bottom of the bottle contains four good-luck symbols (for good fortune, happiness, longevity and prosperity). The beer is sold in bottled and canned form and is imported by Sage Beverages, headquartered in Carlsbad, California. Lucky Buddha Beer has worked with Noble Environmental Technologies and Walmart to develop a sustainable point-of-purchase display that supports Walmart's commitment to reach zero landfill waste by 2025. They are collaborating to create a sustainable end-cap display that is non-toxic, VOC-free, made from 100% recycled materials and is 100% certified bio-based and thereby reduce material use and their carbon footprint.  Design origin  It is believed that the history of the Laughing Buddha bottle design, known as Budai, was a Chan buddhist monk who lived in China around 1,000 years ago. His name means \\"cloth sack\\", and comes from the bag that he is conventionally depicted as carrying. His figure appears throughout Chinese culture as a representation of contentment and his image graces many temples, restaurants, amulets, and businesses. He was known to be exceedingly kind and jolly. He was known for carrying many goods all over the world. He would travel around teaching the Dharma to the people and provide them with goodies he collected on his travels. The empty bottles have been known to be used in arts and craft projects such as making vases and lamps. The buddha-shaped bottles have initiated a number of Do it yourself projects, being repurposed into everything from candle holders to soap dispensers.

The purpose of this subject of study is to determine whether or not there is a pattern to the crime of genocide. The study involves the comparison of current at-risk countries, retrospective cases and the precipitating factors and the legacies surrounding past genocides. The study of comparative genocide begins with studying an at risk country and its history of mass atrocities with an attempt to determine any sort of explanation that can be considered valid as to why genocides occur. The school of thought this study presents is that through the understanding of genocidal crimes and the making of comparisons; this educational approach can help a country's government, the United Nations and the world in the prevention of future genocidal crimes. History Rwanda and Yugoslavia recently experienced mass violence that has been labeled \\"genocide\\". Both instances contributed to the crime of genocide being considered high-profile. The recent mass atrocities caused worldwide concern and debate. The phrase, \\"Never Again\\", was coined in reference to the holocaust and other genocides in order to emphasize the importance of history not repeating itself. It is believed that the responsibility has been put on the world to prevent it, rather than help a country rebuild after it occurs. This study of comparative genocide is now helping with the universality of the potential for genocide. Comparative genocide is derived from the UN Convention of Genocide, it refers to the academic and legal comparison of historical events. Past genocides can give us the insight needed on current genocides, clarifying the issues raised on potential genocides today. The flaw in studying comparative genocide is that the term genocide is an essentially contested concept. The concept itself has various interpretations and in nature is controversial. It is difficult to determine what leads to a genocide, when the world cannot call certain atrocities just that; genocide. Challenges Comparing genocides is difficult because there are limited cases of genocide to study and of the cases that have occurred there are few committed that are legally considered crimes of genocide. Material to make these comparisons is difficult to acquire because post-genocide societies are divided. This division creates problems with access to field research due to cultural, lingual, racial and gender barriers. Scholars who study comparative genocide look at Risk Assessment Analysis to determine whether or not a country is currently at risk. These studies examine a country's state of risk using methods such as the Curve of Conflict and Analytical Framework. These methods of study explore how conflict evolves in a certain country over time and determine where practitioners should apply their influence most productively.

The tunnelling units were occupied in offensive and defensive mining involving the placing and maintaining of mines under enemy lines, as well as other underground work such as the construction of deep dugouts for troop accommodation, the digging of subways, saps (a narrow trench dug to approach enemy trenches), cable trenches and underground chambers for signals and medical services.The Tunnelling Companies RE , access date 25 April 2015 Background By January 1915 it had become evident to the BEF at the Western Front that the Germans were mining to a planned system. As the British had failed to develop suitable counter- tactics or underground listening devices before the war, field marshals French and Kitchener agreed to investigate the suitability of forming British mining units. Following consultations between the Engineer-in-Chief of the BEF, Brigadier George Fowke, and the mining specialist John Norton-Griffiths, the War Office formally approved the tunnelling company scheme on 19 February 1915. Norton-Griffiths ensured that tunnelling companies numbers 170 to 177 were ready for deployment in mid-February 1915.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 49. In the spring of that year, there was constant underground fighting in the Ypres Salient at Hooge, Hill 60, Railway Wood, Sanctuary Wood, St Eloi and The Bluff which required the deployment of new drafts of tunnellers for several months after the formation of the first eight companies. The lack of suitably experienced men led to some tunnelling companies starting work later than others. The number of units available to the BEF was also restricted by the need to provide effective counter-measures to the German mining activities.Peter Barton/Peter Doyle/Johan Vandewalle, Beneath Flanders Fields - The Tunnellers' War 1914-1918, Staplehurst (Spellmount) (978-1862272378) p. 165. To make the tunnels safer and quicker to deploy, the British Army enlisted experienced coal miners, many outside their nominal recruitment policy. The first nine companies, numbers 170 to 178, were each commanded by a regular Royal Engineers officer. These companies each comprised 5 officers and 269 sappers; they were aided by additional infantrymen who were temporarily attached to the tunnellers as required, which almost doubled their numbers. The success of the first tunnelling companies formed under Norton-Griffiths' command led to mining being made a separate branch of the Engineer-in-Chief's office under Major-General S.R. Rice, and the appointment of an 'Inspector of Mines' at the GHQ Saint-Omer office of the Engineer-in-Chief. A second group of tunnelling companies were formed from Welsh miners from the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the Monmouthshire Regiment, who were attached to the 1st Northumberland Field Company of the Royal Engineers, which was a Territorial unit. The formation of twelve new tunnelling companies, between July and October 1915, helped to bring more men into action in other parts of the Western Front. Most tunnelling companies were formed under Norton-Griffiths' leadership during 1915, and one more was added in 1916. On 10 September 1915, the British government sent an appeal to Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand to raise tunnelling companies in the Dominions of the British Empire. On 17 September, New Zealand became the first Dominion to agree the formation of a tunnelling unit. The New Zealand Tunnelling Company arrived at Plymouth on 3 February 1916 and was deployed to the Western Front in northern France.Anthony Byledbal, \\"New Zealand Tunnelling Company: Chronology\\" (online ), access date 5 July 2015 A Canadian unit was formed from men on the battlefield, plus two other companies trained in Canada and then shipped to France. Three Australian tunnelling companies were formed by March 1916, resulting in 30 tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers being available by the summer of 1916. Unit history Formation 171st Tunnelling Company was formed between February and March 1915 of a small number of specially enlisted miners, with troops selected from the Monmouthshire Siege Company of Royal Engineers. 171st Tunnelling Company thus included a significant number of miners from South Wales, as did the 184th, 170th, 172nd, 253rd and 254th Tunnelling Company.Ritchie Wood, Miners at War 1914-1919: South Wales Miners in the Tunneling Companies on the Western Front, Wolverhampton Military Studies, Solihull (Helion and Company) 2016, . From its formation until the end of the war the company served under Second Army in the Ypres Salient.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 20. Hill 60/Messines Map of the mines laid before the Battle of Messines, 1917 171st Tunnelling Company was first employed in March 1915 in the Hill 60/Bluff areas at Ypres. The Germans held the top of Hill 60 from 16 December 1914 to 17 April 1915, when it was captured briefly by the British 5th Division after the explosion of five mines under the German lines by the Royal Engineers. The early underground war in the area had involved both the 171st and 172nd Tunnelling Company. In July 1915, 171st Tunnelling Company moved to Ploegsteert and commenced mining operations near St Yves at the southern end of the Messines ridge. The four deep mines at St Yves, charged with a combined load of of ammonal, formed part of the mine galleries that were dug by the British 171st, 175th, 250th, 1st Canadian, 3rd Canadian and 1st Australian Tunnelling companies as part of the prelude to the Battle of Messines (7‚Äì14 June 1917), while the British 183rd, 2nd Canadian and 2nd Australian Tunnelling companies built underground shelters in the Second Army area. Plan of the deep mines at Trench 127 In December 1915, 171st Tunnelling Company began work on the deep mine at Trench 127 at St Yves. The mine consisted of two chambers (Trench 127 Left, Right) with a shared gallery. The name indicates the British lines where the initial shaft was dug, not where the mine was placed under the German positions. The shaft was completed to a depth of within four weeks, however after driving a gallery the Royal Engineers faced a sudden inrush of quicksand and a concrete dam had to be constructed. A new attempt was made, and by April 1916 the Trench 127 mine was ready, with the ammonal charges over away from the initial shaft. Plan of the deep mines at La Petite Douve Farm At the end of January 1916, 171st Tunnelling Company began mining operations at La Petite Douve Farm. The farm, located next to the road from Messines to Ploegsteert Wood, was enclosed by a German trench system known as ULNA. Also at this point was a junction on the narrow gauge railway system which ran from the forward areas of Messines to the rear areas around Nieuwkerke. This operation was characterized by setbacks. Difficult geology lead to two mines being abandoned before completion, and after a charge of of ammonal had been put in place beneath the farm, the gallery was discovered by a German counter-mining operation on 24 August 1916. Three days later the German miners blew a heavy charge, which shattered about of the main gallery and killed four men engaged in repairs. This camouflet wrecked the British gallery completely and forced the Royal Engineers to abandon the tunnel, which then quickly flooded. Plan of the deep mines at Trench 122 At the end of February 1916, 171st Tunnelling Company began work on the deep mine at Trench 122 at St Yves. The mine consisted of two chambers (Trench 122 Left, Right) with a shared gallery. The name indicates the British lines where the initial shaft was dug, due west of where the crater is today. The area was dominated by a complex of German trenches and by mid-May first charge of of ammonal was in place at Trench 122 Left. Another shaft (Trench 122 Right) was started part way along the original tunnel and after another , a charge of 40,000 lbs of ammonal was placed by the Royal Engineers beneath the ruins of Factory Farm which sat on the German front line. Plan of the deep mine at Spanbroekmolen In April 1916, 171st Tunnelling Company moved to the Spanbroekmolen/Douve sector facing the Messines ridge. At Spanbroekmolen, 171st Tunnelling Company took over from 3rd Canadian Tunnelling Company and extended the work to the German lines, driving the tunnel forward by in seven months until it was beneath the powerful German position. At the end of June 1916 the charge of of ammonal in 1,820 waterproof tins was complete, the largest yet laid by the British. With the mine complete, the British selected two additional objectives to be attacked near Spanbroekmolen, Rag Point and Hop Point, which were and from the main tunnel. A branch was started and inclined down to depth. By mid-February 1917 the branch had been driven and passed the German lines. At that point, the German counter mining activities damaged of the branch gallery and some of the main tunnel. The British decided to abandon the branch gallery because aggressive counter-mining would alert the Germans to the presence of a deep-mining scheme. On 3 March the Germans blew the main tunnel with a heavy charge laid from their Ewald shaft, leaving it beyond repair and resulting in it being cut off for three months. The British started a new gallery alongside the old main tunnel which after cut into the original workings. Mining was greatly hampered by the influx of gas, several miners being overcome by the fumes, but eventually ‚Äì and only a few hours before the appointed time of detonation at 03:10 a.m. on 7 June 1917 ‚Äì the ammonal charge was ready again and secured by of tamping with sandbags and a primer charge of of dynamite. The Spanbroekmolen mine exploded 15 seconds late, killing a number of British soldiers from the 36th (Ulster) Division, some of whom are buried at Lone Tree Cemetery nearby. Plan of the Kruisstraat mines While employed at Spanbroekmolen, 171st Tunnelling Company also took over work on the nearby deep mines at Kruisstraat. Work there was begun by 250th Tunnelling Company in December 1915, passed to 182nd Tunnelling Company, then to 3rd Canadian Tunnelling Company and 175th Tunnelling Company, which took charge in April 1916. When the gallery reached it was handed over to 171st Tunnelling Company. At a charge of of ammonal was laid and at the end of a small branch of to the right a second charge of was placed under the German front line. This completed the original plan, but it was decided to extend the mining to a position under the German third line. Despite meeting clay and being inundated with water underground which necessitated the digging of a sump, they managed to complete a gallery stretching almost half a mile from the shaft in just two months, and a further charge of of ammonal was placed. This tunnel was the longest of any of the Messines mines. In February 1917, German countermeasures necessitated some repair to one of the chambers and the opportunity was taken to place a further charge of marking a total of four mines, all of which were ready by 9 May 1917. Plan of the deep mine at Ontario Farm At the end of January 1917, the 171st Tunnelling Company began work on the deep mine at Ontario Farm. The ground at the site selected for this mine proved very difficult as much of it was sandy clay. The miners began to dig at Boyle's Farm which is just on the southern side of the main road (Mesenstraat/Nieuwkerkestraat) passing by. The shaft went down and pumps were installed to bring air down and water out of the mine. After tunnelling forward, the miners broke into blue clay, extending the depth to some . After driving the gallery almost forward, the flooding was so bad that a dam had to be constructed and a new gallery started. Despite these obstacles, the tunnellers arrived under Ontario Farm at the end of May 1917 and installed the ammonal charge with a day to spare. When it was detonated on 7 June 1915, the mine did not produce a crater but left a shallow indentation in the soft clay; the shock wave did great damage to the German position. The explosion caught two battalions of the 17th Bavarian Infantry Regiment during a relief, half of which were \\"as good as annihilated\\". The mines at Messines were detonated on 7 June 1917, creating craters. Vampire dugout The 171st Tunnelling Company stayed in the Ypres Salient and moved near the village of Zonnebeke, where it constructed the Vampire dugout (known locally as the Vampyr dugout). Vampire was built to house a brigade headquarters of up to 50 men and one senior commanding officer. Located close to Polygon Wood, it was named after the supply soldiers whose mission was to come out at night to re-supply troops in the front line. At the end of the Third Battle of Ypres/Battle of Passchendaele (31 July‚Äì10 November 1917), having retaken Passchendaele ridge, the British were left with little natural shelter from the former woods and farms. The artillery of both sides had literally flattened the landscape. Needing shelter for their troops, the Allied High Command in January 1918 moved 25,000 specialist tunnellers and 50,000 attached infantry who had been preparing and taking part in the Battle of Messines north in the Ypres Salient. There they dug almost 200 independent and connected structures at depths of into the blue clay, which could accommodate from 50 men, to the largest at Wieltje and Hill 63 which could house 2,000. The level of the activity can be gauged by the fact that by March 1918, more people lived underground in the Ypres area than reside above ground in the town today. Connected by corridors measuring high by wide, they were fitted with water pumps to deal with the high groundwater table. Created below Flanders by the 171st Tunnelling Company, and dug over a period of four months, the engineers used I beams and reclaimed railway line in a D-type sett structure. This was then further reinforced, using stepped wooden horizontal beams. The Vampire dugout became operational from early April 1918, first housing the 100th Brigade of the British 33rd Division, then the 16th King's Royal Rifle Corps and then the 9th Battalion Highland Light Infantry Regiment. After only a few weeks, the dugout was lost when the Germans undertook the Battle of the Lys in April 1918. It was recaptured in September 1918, when its last occupants became the 2nd Battalion of the Worcestershire Regiment. Zonnebeke church dugout The Zonnebeke Church Dugout, constructed by 171st Tunnelling Company in 1918 (model) In March 1918, the 171st Tunnelling Company constructed a deep dugout in the centre of Zonnebeke, located directly beneath the ruins of the parish church. This dugout was only discovered after the Second World War during archaeological excavations of the Augustinian abbey. Today the outline of this dugout is marked in an archaeological garden within the church grounds, and a model of the church dugout can be seen at the \\"Memorial Museum Passchendaele 1917\\" in Zonnebeke.Zonnebeke Church Dugout wordt niet toegankelijk voor publiek, 04/11/2010, access date 9 July 2015 Spring Offensive Shortly after the completion of the Vampire dugout, 171st and several other tunnelling companies (173rd, 183rd, 184th, 255th, 258th and 3rd Australian) were forced to move from their camps at Boeschepe in April 1918, when the enemy broke through the Lys positions during the Spring Offensive. These units were then put on duties that included digging and wiring trenches over a long distance from Reningelst to near Saint-Omer. The operation to construct these fortifications between Reningelst and Saint-Omer was carried out jointly by the British 171st, 173rd, 183rd, 184th, 255th, 258th, 3rd Canadian and 3rd Australian Tunnelling Companies.

Its enclosed cabin could accommodate up to eighteen passengers. Design and development After the end of world War I, some Caudron C.23s, a large trimotor night bomber, were modified to act as passenger aircraft, but the C.25 was the first aircraft Caudron had designed from the beginning to carry passengers. It was large, with a span, so Caudron built in hinges to allow the wings to be folded for easier handling on the ground. The wings were rectangular in plan, mounted without stagger and fabric covered. It was a three-bay biplane with unusually thin, wooden, parallel, vertical interplane struts, assisted by flying wires of thicker than usual gauge. The engine mountings, two pairs of parallel struts, defined the inner bay. The outer pair of these struts were doubled since this was where the wing folded, and so the ends of the wing either side of the fold retained their struts. Four vertical cabane struts braced the centre of the upper wing from the upper fuselage. There were ailerons on both lower and lower planes, extending over more than half the span. These were not aerodynamically balanced in the usual way but were connected to each other by three vertical rods which halfway up were hinged to the trailing edge of a narrower and shorter horizontal surface which rotated about an axis well behind its aerodynamic centre. The wires from the cockpit operated these ancillary surfaces, which then moved the ailerons, just as the leading edge of a conventional balanced aileron, extending forward of the hinge, assists the pilot's input. The Caudron C.23 was powered by three Salmson 9Z nine cylinder water-cooled radial engines, each neatly cowled. Two were mounted halfway between the wings in flat-sided nacelles which curved to a point at the rear and the third was nose-mounted. The wing-mounted engines had fuel tanks in the nacelles, and the nose engine was served by a tank behind it. Behind it the fuselage was rectangular in section and plywood covered to the rear of the passenger cabin, after which it was fabric covered. The two crew sat in separate, wide, side-by-side open cockpits in the upper part of the fuselage ahead of the wing leading edge. The protrusion of their cockpits into the lower fuselage divided the passenger space into a main cabin behind and a smaller one forwards, accessed by ducking under the bottom of the cockpits. The interior had large windows and was carefully furnished, with wicker armchairs and tables, lighting and decorated walls; a toilet was provided. The horizontal tail was a biplane unit with the lower tailplane attached to the bottom of the fuselage and the upper one on top of a small, shallow fin. The rectangular tailplanes were braced together by two interplane struts on each side; both were rectangular and carried elevators. Three rudders occupied the gap between the elevators, the tips cut away for elevator movement. Only the outer rudders were balanced, but these were directly connected to the central one, assisting it. The C.25 had fixed tailskid conventional landing gear with main wheels in pairs under each engine, assisted by another pair under the nose to prevent noseovers. The C.25 was on display at the Paris Aero Show in 1919, though it may not have flown by then. Little is recorded on its subsequent history.

Toktokkies do not belong to a particular tribe or genus of Tenebrionids, but rather a selection of flightless species with distinct tapping noises. The Tenebrionidae family to which these beetles belong is quite large, with almost 3,500 species inhabiting Southern Africa. Nearly 200 species of Toktokkies inhabit the country of Namibia and 20 have adapted to the extreme temperatures of the Namib Desert. The most common Toktokkies in the Namib Desert are the Fog Basking beetle (Onymacris unguicularis) and the button beetle or trench- digging beetle (Lepidochora discoidalis). Specimens The \\"fog-basking\\" beetle(O. unguicularis) gets its water source from the fog through special biological adaptations. When the fog rolls in at night or early in the morning, these beetles climb to the peak of the dunes, where the water condensation is most dense. The beetle performs a handstand by lower lowering its head and raising its posterior. The fog condenses on its back and drips into the mouthparts. Through this process the ‚Äúfog-basking‚Äù beetles can drink 40% of their body-mass. The \\"fog-trapping\\" beetle (L. discoidalis) also gets its water from the fog, but it acquires it in a different manner. After foraging for the first half of the night, the ‚Äúfog-trapping‚Äù beetle burrows into the sand. It returns to the surface late at night or early in the morning when the fog rolls across the Namib Desert. It digs a trench into the side of the dune and droplets of water build up on ridges of the trench. The ‚Äúfog- trapping‚Äù beetles then lick off the droplets of water. Physical description Toktokkies are about 65mm in length and are black or dark brown in color. They are stout, wingless creatures with a tough outer casing. Although they once had wings, tenebrionid beetles are flightless. Their wings have evolved over time, transferring from separated to move aside for flight to fused on their backs. Once this evolutionary process occurred, a small cavity was left where the wings used to fold. This has reduced water loss caused by evaporation because the Toktokkies‚Äô respiratory pores now open into this humid cavity, instead of being exposed all the time to the dry air. Habitat Toktokkies live throughout the country of Namibia. Nearly 20 species have adapted to live in arid climates, like the Namib Desert. Most species inhabit slipfaces and valleys between dunes, searching for the sheltered side of the dunes because large quantities of windblown detritus accumulate in these spaces. Their habitat choice is influenced by food supply. The slipfaces, although they occupy less than 1% of dune surfaces, are filled with insects and species endemic to the Namib Desert. Behavior The Toktokkie beetles have specific behaviors that allow them to survive in arid environments like the Namib Desert. Most of the beetles perform ‚Äúheadstands‚Äù to obtain moisture from the fog that rolls in from the Atlantic Ocean. Toktokkies time their movements around the fog, which usually rolls in during the late evening and early morning. The beetles will climb a dune; perform a ‚Äúheadstand‚Äù facing the west and collect fog on their entire body. Toktokkie beetles receive their name from a unique clicking noise they make. Their name is derived from the children's game where players knock on front doors and then run away. These beetles create this noise by raising and lowering their abdomen, like knocking, in quick sequences. Adaptations to adverse environmental conditions The size of these beetles, being larger than other beetles, helps them keep cool. Also, their shells made of thick chitin help keep out heat and increase moisture. Being in arid environments, they have traded their separate wings for one fused wing that facilitates a moisture protection system. They now ‚Äúbreathe‚Äù through a hole that is under their fused wing. This adaptation allows them to trap moisture when they breathe. They have also learned to burrow in the sand when they get too hot. Reproduction Toktokkie beetles use the clicking noise as a mating ritual. Tapping is a way the males and females communicate between each other. The male will initiates the tapping and a receptive female responds. The pair will make contact and mate following a length of exchanged signals. The female beetle lay one egg that is approximately 6mm in length. She puts it in a shallow hole in the earth's surface.

In the autumn of that year, he joined the Class of 1863 of Yale College, graduating in due course, and taking the degree of Master of Arts three years later, in 1866. Thereafter, for four years, he was in preparation for the ministry, one of those years, however, spent as a private tutor. In 1867 he graduated at the Philadelphia Divinity School, and was admitted Deacon by the Right Reverend William Henry Odenheimer, D.D., Bishop of New Jersey, in Trinity Church, Newark, on June 21. Immediately upon admission to the ministry, he offered himself to the Right Reverend George H. Randall, D.D., Bishop of Colorado, to serve as missionary in his jurisdiction; and during August, 1867, he journeyed across the plains, a considerable portion of the journey being by stagecoach, to Denver, and thence to Black Hawk and Central City, in the mountains west of Denver. In these places, and at Georgetown and Idaho City, he held service and did missionary work for three years. He was married on July 29, 1868, to Charlotte Burgoyne King, of Roxborough, Mass.

Hazeltine Research, Inc. is the caption of several United States Supreme Court patent‚Äìrelated decisions, the most significant of which is a 1969 patent‚Äìantitrust and patent‚Äìmisuse decision concerning the levying of patent royalties on unpatented products. 1969 Case In Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 100 (1969),. Hazeltine had required an unwilling Zenith to pay a percentage of all its sales of electronic equipment in order to be granted a license under Hazeltine's patents. The Supreme Court held that requiring a patent licensee to pay a percentage of its total patented and non-patented product sales as a condition of the license was misuse. On the other hand, the Court said, if the parties adopted this method of determining royalties (\\"total‚Äìsales royalties\\") without coercion and for mutual convenience, such as because of the difficulty in making a precise accounting, then the expedient was not misuse. Zenith had sued Hazeltine for a declaration of misuse and treble antitrust damages. It was therefore necessary for the Court to determine whether coercive total‚Äìsales royalties was not only misuse but a basis for antitrust damages as well. The Court ruled that for Hazeltine to be liable for antitrust treble damages, the other requirements of such an action must be met‚Äîsuch as sufficient anti-competitive impact.395 U.S. at 140. This holding reaffirmed a line of Supreme Court patent‚Äìmisuse decisions holding that the competitive impact of a restrictive practice may fall short of an antitrust violation and nonetheless be misuse.See, e.g., . 1971 Case The case was brought to the Supreme Court again in 1971. In Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc.,. the Supreme Court reversed the Seventh Circuit's remand decision in the preceding 1969 case. In its decision on remand, the district court had found an antitrust violation‚Äîparticipating in foreign patent pools that excluded Zenith from selling in the U.S. market‚Äîand awarded damages to Zenith. The district court rejected a statute of limitations defense. On appeal to the Seventh Circuit, it reversed on statute of limitations grounds; it remanded for a reduction of the award because part of the damages resulted from conduct that occurred outside the statute of limitations. The Supreme Court reversed the Seventh Circuit, instructing it to reinstate the district court judgment. The Supreme Court held that the statute of limitations had been tolled by a government suit, even though Zenith was not involved in that suit and Hazeltine was not named as a defendant co‚Äìconspirator.401 U.S. at 336‚Äì38. In establishing precedent, the Court held that Zenith was still entitled to damages for the lasting and future effects of conspiratorial conduct, even if the statute of limitations were not tolled. \\"Generally, a cause of action accrues and the statute begins to run when a defendant commits an act that injures a plaintiff's business.401 U.S. at 808., that is, \\"each time a plaintiff is injured by an act of the defendants a cause of action accrues to him to recover the damages caused by that act and that, as to those damages, the statute of limitations runs from the commission of the act.\\" However, this applies only to the damages caused immediately. When there are future injuries \\"that might arise from the conduct sued on are unrecoverable if the fact of their accrual is speculative or their amount and nature unprovable,\\" then the statute does not begin to run on the injuries until they occur and can be ascertained. Accordingly, the statute of limitations did not bar the recovery Zenith sought.401 U.S. at 341‚Äì02.

Suppiger Co., 314 U.S. 488 (1942), is a patent misuse decision of the United States Supreme Court. It was the first case in which the Court expressly labeled as \\"misuse\\" the Motion Picture Patent/Carbice tie- in defense to a charge of patent infringement and created the present blanket remedy in infringement cases of unenforceability of the misused patent. (\\"Equity may rightly withhold its assistance from such a use of the patent by declining to entertain a suit for infringement, and should do so at least until it is made to appear that the improper practice has been abandoned and that the consequences of the misuse of the patent have been dissipated.\\") The decision re-emphasized that misuse can be found without finding an antitrust violation.314 U.S. at 494 (\\"It is unnecessary to decide whether respondent has violated the Clayton Act, for we conclude that, in any event, the maintenance of the present suit to restrain petitioner's manufacture or sale of the alleged infringing machines is contrary to public policy, and that the district court rightly dismissed the complaint for want of equity.\\") Background Salt dispensing machine at issue in Suppiger case Facts G.S. Suppiger Co. operated a canning company which had a subsidiary \\"devoted to making and leasing a patented tablet depositing machine and to making and selling salt tablets of a particular design and configuration.\\" The salt tablets were unpatented, common salt (NaCl) but they had a particular shape to fit the patented salt tablet depositing machine that Suppiger made (\\"a particular configuration which is required for use in plaintiff's depositing machines for continuous, untroubled use\\"). Suppiger's leases to canners of tomatoes and other vegetables \\"included a license to use the patented machine, upon the condition and agreement by the lessee that plaintiff's and its predecessor's salt tablets be used exclusively in said patented, leased machines.\\" Morton Salt Co. was in the same business and made and leased salt tablet depositing machines alleged to infringe the patent, as well as salt tablets for the machines. Morton also provided in its \\"leases that the lessee shall use only salt tablets made by it.\\" The facts were undisputed.117 F.2d at 970. Proceedings in lower courts Morton sued Suppiger and the district court dismissed the complaint on summary judgment because of \\"plaintiff's use of its patent to develop a monopoly of an unpatented article, to-wit, salt tablets.\\" The Seventh Circuit reversed because Suppiger controlled only a small amount of the salt market by its tie-in: > The volume of all the salt business is large. The amount used in the canning > field is so small that its complete control would not result in a monopoly > of the salt industry. It is not the salt tablet as such but the salt which > goes into the salt tablet which must determine the monopolistic tendency of > plaintiff's lease contracts.117 F.2d at 972. Section 3 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. ¬ß 14, makes certain tie-ins unlawful. \\"However, unlawfulness is made to depend upon a provision which is here important, where the effect of such lease or such condition may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce.\\" The record did not support a conclusion that Suppiger's tie-in had such an effect.117 F.2d at 971. Morton appealed to the Supreme Court. Ruling of the Supreme Court Chief Justice Harlan Fiske Stone Chief Justice Harlan Stone delivered the opinion of the Court, unanimously reversing the judgment of the Seventh Circuit. He began by stating that the court of appeals misunderstood the relevant issue: \\"The question we must decide is not necessarily whether respondent has violated the Clayton Act, but whether a court of equity will lend its aid to protect the patent monopoly when respondent is using it as the effective means of restraining competition with its sale of an unpatented article.\\"314 U.S. at 490. Moreover, \\"nothing turns on the fact that petitioner also competes with respondent in the sale of the tablets, and we may assume for purposes of this case that petitioner is doing no more than making and leasing the alleged infringing machines\\" subject to a tie-in as to the salt tablets.314 U.S. at 491. On these facts, Suppiger \\"is making use of its patent monopoly to restrain competition in the marketing of unpatented articles, salt tablets, for use with the patented machines, and is aiding in the creation of a limited monopoly in the tablets not within that granted by the patent.\\" Suppiger has a patent on the tablet dispensing machine, not on salt tablets. The patent gives it a monopoly \\"to make, use, and vend the particular device described and claimed in the patent. But a patent affords no immunity for a monopoly not within the grant.\\" The policy of the patent system \\"includes inventions within the granted monopoly [but] excludes from it all that is not embraced in the invention. It equally forbids the use of the patent to secure an exclusive right or limited monopoly not granted by the Patent Office and which it is contrary to public policy to grant.\\" It is well recognized that \\"courts of equity may appropriately withhold their aid where the plaintiff is using the right asserted contrary to the public interest.\\"314 U.S. at 492. The proper rule in such cases, the Court said, is: > Where the patent is used as a means of restraining competition with the > patentee's sale of an unpatented product, the successful prosecution of an > infringement suit, even against one who is not a competitor in such sale, is > a powerful aid to the maintenance of the attempted monopoly of the > unpatented article, and is thus a contributing factor in thwarting the > public policy underlying the grant of the patent. Maintenance and > enlargement of the attempted monopoly of the unpatented article are > dependent to some extent upon persuading the public of the validity of the > patent, which the infringement suit is intended to establish. Equity may > rightly withhold its assistance from such a use of the patent by declining > to entertain a suit for infringement, and should do so at least until it is > made to appear that the improper practice has been abandoned and that the > consequences of the misuse of the patent have been dissipated.314 U.S. at > 493. The reasons for invoking the \\"clean hands\\" doctrine to bar the prosecution of an infringement suit against even one who is not a competitor with the patentee in the sale of the unpatented product (here, salt tabletsThe Court assumes here that the relevant market is salt tablets rather than salt, which the Seventh Circuit considered the relevant market.) are fundamentally the same as those which bar an infringement suit against a licensee who has violated a condition of the license by using with the licensed machine a competing unpatented article, as in the Motion Picture Patents case: \\"It is the adverse effect upon the public interest of a successful infringement suit in conjunction with the patentee's course of conduct which disqualifies him to maintain the suit, regardless of whether the particular defendant has suffered from the misuse of the patent.314 U.S. at 493-94. These considerations made it unnecessary, the Court added, to decide whether Suppiger had committed an antitrust violation \\"for we conclude that, in any event, the maintenance of the present suit to restrain petitioner's manufacture or sale of the alleged infringing machines is contrary to public policy, and that the district court rightly dismissed the complaint for want of equity.\\" Subsequent development of unenforceability defense The Suppiger case expanded the patent misuse defense from its original rule that a contractual provision considered patent misuse could not be enforced, as in the Motion Picture Patents tie-in case, to a defense in third party infringement suits, as in Suppiger, where the patentee's use of a tie-in disabled it from enforcing its patent against infringement by Morton. The disability continues until the misuse has been fully \\"purged\\" and its effects have fully dissipated.See ; see also Suppiger, 314 U.S. at 493. B.B. Chemical was a companion case to Suppiger that developed more fully the requirement for \\"purgation\\" before misuse would stop preventing grant of relief against infringement or collection of royalties. Some critics have argued that this remedy is too harsh,See, e.g., Mark A. Lemley, Comment, The Economic Irrationality of the Patent Misuse Doctrine, 78 1599 (1990). and that it should be enough to require the patentee to stop engaging in the abusive conduct. The Seventh Circuit, in Panther Pumps & Equipment Co. v. Hydrocraft, Inc., effectively limited Suppiger by holding that violations of the rule in Lear, Inc. v. Adkins,. against agreements not to challenge patent validity should not lead to the harsh result of making the patent unenforceable against infringement, because such an agreement was \\"not the kind of misuse which forecloses recovery of damages\\" from an infringer. On the other hand, such a rule of lenity may encourage patentees to adopt the principle of \\"nothing ventured, nothing gained.\\" References External links * 1942 in United States case law Patent case law United States Supreme Court cases United States Supreme Court cases of the Stone Court United States misuse law ","title":"Morton Salt Co. v.

Prior to that, Soros worked at Soros Fund Management in daily operations and was co-deputy chairman of the organization. He has been a prominent donor to Democratic and progressive political causes. Soros started the Friends of Democracy PAC, now merged into Every Voice, to push for campaign finance reform and the abolition of the electoral college. Early life and education Soros' parents are Annaliese Witschak and business magnate George Soros, who divorced in 1981. He is the brother of Andrea and Robert Soros and half-brother of Gregory and Alexander, from his father's second marriage to Susan Weber. He graduated from Wesleyan University in Connecticut in 1992. He received a Master of Arts in public policy at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government and a Juris Doctor from Harvard Law School.  Career   Early career  Soros worked for a federal judge as a law clerk before joining Soros Fund Management.  Soros Fund  Soros worked at Soros Fund Management beginning in 2002 and in 2004, he and his brother, Robert, became co-deputy chairmen of the organization that managed $12.8 billion in funds at that time. Their father stepped down at that time, but remained as chairman. He focused on operations and was the organization's chief investment officer until he stepped down in 2011. His father said that Jonathan was \\"the principal architect of our transition to a healthy and stable investment operation\\" out of a turbulent financial period. However, that year, the organization had incurred \\"significant losses\\" and had converted to a family office‚Äîmanaging the funds of George, his foundation, and Soros family members‚Äî and no longer operating as a hedge fund. In the process, its investors received $1 billion from the fund. Reuters states that the move was made to avoid a deadline to register at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as an investment manager. Jonathan remained on the board of his father's foundation. JS Financial Soros is the founder and chief executive officer of JS Capital Management LLC, a private investment firm, located in midtown Manhattan near Central Park. The second quarter 2015 filings showed that the U.S. assets in its portfolio were valued at $500 million, up from $394.76 million the previous quarter. In 2015, Bloomberg Politics identified him as one of the hedge fund titans. Political advocacy Campaign reform He advocates for the removal of the electoral college, which he says is undemocratic and unconstitutional. This is the position of the Every Voice political advocacy group and the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact that advocates for electoral votes to be given to each state based upon certified results of the popular vote. In July 2012, Soros started and funded Friends of Democracy PAC (now merged into Every Voice), a hybrid political action committee and super PAC designed to push for campaign finance reform that would mandate a public financing system for all federal elections. Soros' organization was described as an \\"anti-super PAC super PAC\\" by The Washington Post. Founded with Ilyse Hogue, formerly with Media Matters for America and MoveOn.org, and David Donnelly, executive director of the Public Campaign Action Fund, the goal of the organization is to elect candidates that support campaign reform, including public matching funds for elections. Its strategy is to identify 10 to 15 districts where incumbent senators or congressmen have not supported \\"citizen-led\\" elections, and use multiple forms of media‚Äîlike television ads, direct mail, phone calls, internet ads‚Äîto communicate the lawmaker's position on campaign funding. For instance, Soros, the organization's largest contributor, helped fund the 2012 election of Cecilia Tkaczyk, who supports changes to funding for state elections by implementing a system of public financing. She won by a small margin, in a district that historically elected Republicans. By 2014, he gave $2 million over a few years to support initiatives and candidates, and a total of $3.7 million was spent by Soros for Democratic candidates by October of that year. Seven of the eight candidates that the PAC chose to back were elected in 2014. He is a member of Democracy Alliance, an organization that funds Democratic campaigns. The American Prospect said of him, \\"Jonathan Soros has emerged in recent years as a savvy donor and operative, much more hands-on than his father, George, the billionaire investor and Democratic donor.\\" He backed two state legislative initiatives in 2016 to reform campaign financing, one on the state of Washington and the other in South Dakota. Washington Initiative 1464 would have provided $150 for each voter to contribute towards a candidate of their choice and limited contributions by government contractors and lobbyists. It did not pass. However, South Dakota's Government Accountability and Anti- Corruption Act was successful. Other groups Soros has worked with MoveOn.org and other political advocacy groups. He is a senior fellow at the Roosevelt Institute and a member of the board of directors of the New America Foundation and the Open Society Foundations. He is a donor to the Democracy Alliance. He supports the New York Leadership for Accountable Government, formed about 2012. By March 2013, he supported small donor democracy, in which small-dollar campaign contributions are multiple-matched to increase participation by citizens and donor diversity. He contributed to Hillary Clinton and Martin O'Malley's presidential campaigns in 2015. In 2016, he donated $1 million to the Planned Parenthood Super PAC, which supported the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. Personal life Soros married Jennifer Allan in 1997, who was a social worker when they met. The two first met while working for the 1992 Clinton-Gore presidential campaign. Beginning in 2000, the couple lived in a townhouse in the West Village of Manhattan.

American Patents Development Corp., 283 U.S. 27 (1931), is a decision of the United States Supreme Court extending the patent misuse doctrine against tie-ins to cases in which patents were used to tie the purchase of unpatented elements of patented combinations.Carbice Corp. v. Am. Patents Dev. Corp., . The Court had previously held that it was unlawful to require the purchase of supplies as a condition of a patent license, where the supplies were not claimed as part of the patented combination.. Background Cross-sectional drawings of inner and outer containers of device of U.S. Pat. No. 1,595,426 American Patents Development Corp. (APDC) held a patent for a dry iceDry ice is solid, frozen carbon dioxide (CO2). Its temperature is ‚Äì110 ¬∞F (78 ¬∞C) or below. It does not liquefy under atmospheric pressure at temperatures above ‚Äì110 ¬∞F but turns directly into gaseous CO2 transport enclosure (shipping container), in which a smaller container of dry ice was surrounded by a freezable material (such as ice cream) being refrigerated; this arrangement was contrary to the usual packaging practice of surrounding the material being refrigerated with regular ice.U.S. Pat. No. 1,595,426 The patent was not on dry ice itself, which was well known as a refrigerant, nor on the container itself, but on the combination of the container and dry ice and the freezable material. A typical claim of the patent provided: > 6. A transportation package consisting of a protective casing of insulating > material having packed therein a quantity of frozen carbon dioxide in an > insulating container and a quantity of freezable product in freezing > proximity to said frozen carbon dioxide and the gas evaporated therefrom, > arranged so that said frozen carbon dioxide is less accessible for exterior > heat than said freezable products. APDC licensed the patent exclusively to Dry Ice Corp. (DIC). DIC made and sold only dry ice. It designated other firms to make and sell the patented transportation devices (see diagram of box within a box). Each invoice for the dry ice that DIC sold had this notice: > The merchandise herein described is shipped upon the following condition: > That DryIce shall not be used except in DryIce cabinets or other containers > or apparatus provided or approved by the DryIce Corporation of America, and > the DryIce Cabinets or other containers or apparatus provided or approved by > the DryIce Corporation of America shall be refrigerated or used only with > DryIce. Carbice manufactured and sold dry ice to a Mr. Marchiony (and other persons) who combined the dry ice with containers he originally bought from a supplier approved by DIC, but then he reused the containers without the consent of DIC.See APDC then sued Carbice, but that court dismissed the suit on the grounds that no infringement occurred because the dry ice was a perishable supply used in practicing the patent.25 F.2d at 733. APDC appealed to the Second Circuit, which reversed the judgment of the district court. The Second Circuit said that the doctrine of the Motion Picture Patents case did not apply, because the tied product (the dry ice) was a claimed element of the patented combination. That made the case different from prior tie-in cases in which the tied product was an unpatented supply (such as ink or film) used together with the patented device. The Second Circuit said: > It is only unpatented materials which form no part of the patented machine > which the Supreme Court held the purchaser of the machine may use at will. > The solid carbon dioxide forms the most vital part of plaintiffs' patented > package. Marchiony might legally use defendant's carbice in any way not > covered by the patent in suit, but he could not manufacture the patented > package without the plaintiffs' consent, a consent which they withheld, > unless the vital ingredient of its manufacture was purchased from them. To > extend the doctrine of the Motion Picture Case as defendant contends would > completely destroy the monopoly of plaintiffs' patent. Carbice then appealed to the Supreme Court. Ruling of Supreme Court Justice Brandeis Justice Brandeis wrote for a unanimous Court, reversing the Second Circuit and reinstating the judgment of the district court. After explaining the factual setting, the Court said: \\"Whether the transportation package described is a patentable invention we need not determine. For even if it is, no relief can be granted.\\" The Court cited Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co. for the proposition that a patentee \\"may not exact as the condition of a license that unpatented materials used in connection with the invention shall be purchased only from the licensor, and if it does so, relief against one who supplies such unpatented materials will be denied. The limited monopoly to make, use, and vend an article may not be 'expanded by limitations as to materials and supplies necessary to the operation of it.' \\"283 U.S. at 31. The Court added, \\"The relief here sought is indistinguishable from that denied in the Motion Picture Case.\\" The Court rejected the patentee's attempt to distinguish Motion Picture Patents on the theory that the dry ice was a claimed element of the patented combination while earlier tie-in cases involved supplies that were not part of the patented invention. That was \\"without legal significance,\\" because: > The Dry Ice Corporation has no right to be free from competition in the sale > of solid carbon dioxide. Control over the supply of such unpatented material > is beyond the scope of the patentee's monopoly, and this limitation, > inherent in the patent grant, is not dependent upon the peculiar function or > character of the unpatented material or on the way in which it is used. 283 > U.S. at 33. Further developments Dry Ice Corporation (DIC) remained defiant despite the ruling of the Supreme Court. and it inaugurated \\"a campaign of intimidation against customers of the Carbice Corporation.\\"Carbice Corp. v. Am. Patents Dev. Corp., . DIC released > to the public press a statement that the validity of the patent as sustained > by the Court of Appeals had not been disturbed; that the true patent > monopoly had in no way been limited by this Court; that we had indicated > that the proper way to enforce the patent monopoly is by directly suing > those who use solid carbon dioxide in the patent combination without a > license; and that the Dry Ice Corporation would immediately bring such a > suit. The Supreme Court ordered a re-argument and rehearing, limited to the question of the validity of the patent.Carbice Corp. v. Am. Patents Dev. Corp., . U.S. Patent No. 1,595,426, claims a refrigerating transportation package, consisting of an outer, insulating container, with the food substance to be refrigerated (e.g., ice cream) so packed therein as to surround a quantity of solid carbon dioxide in its separate insulating container, and thus to act, with the evolved gaseous dioxide, as a protection for the solid dioxide against exterior heat, the gas also serving to displace air from the food and refrigerate it. The alleged invention is thus \\"for the locational arrangement of materials within a container.\\"283 U.S. at 321. The Court said that it did not need to determine whether \\"a locational arrangement within a structure can ever be patented,\\" because this patent \\"lacks patentable invention and novelty\\": > Each of the elements‚Äîrefrigerant, material to be refrigerated, and > container‚Äîperforms its function in a known way. Long prior to the date of > the claimed invention, it was known that solid carbon dioxide, which has a > temperature of 110 degrees below zero, is a refrigerant; that, when it > \\"melts,\\" it passes directly into a dry gas heavier than air, of like low > temperature, which may serve as a refrigerant until its temperature rises to > that of the outside air. It was known also that a frozen article‚Äîbe it ice > cream or solid carbon dioxide‚Äîwill remain frozen longer if insulated, and > that paper is an insulator. It was not invention to conclude that a cake of > the solid dioxide wrapped in paper would remain solid longer if also > surrounded by ice cream than if placed in more immediate proximity to the > walls of the container, and thus to the outer air, or to conclude that the > gas, being heavier than air, would, as generated, drive the air out of the > container, and thus serve as an additional insulator. Moreover, the > structural device of surrounding the refrigerant by the article to be > refrigerated had been shown in the Mosler and Ladewig refrigerating butter- > box . . . and in Rumpel's portable lunch box.283 U.S. at 421-22. The invalidation of the patent thus terminated the \\"campaign of intimidation against customers\\" by threats of patent infringement suits.

Universal Film Mfg. Co., 243 U.S. 502 (1917), is United States Supreme Court decision that is notable as an early example of the patent misuse doctrine. It held that, because a patent grant is limited to the invention described in the claims of the patent, the patent law does not empower the patent owner, by notices attached to the patented article, to extend the scope of the patent monopoly by restricting the use of the patented article to materials necessary for their operation but forming no part of the patented invention, or to place downstream restrictions on the articles making them subject to conditions as to use.. The decision overruled The Button- Fastener Case,Heaton-Peninsular Button-Fastener Co. v. Eureka Specialty Co., 77 F. 288 (6th Cir. 1896). and Henry v. A.B. Dick Co.,. which had held such restrictive notices effective and enforceable. Background Diagram of patented device involved in MPP case The Motion Picture Patents Company (MPP) was the assignee of a number of patents covering motion picture projectors, including US Pat. No. 707,934, on a part of the mechanism used in motion picture Projectors to feed a film through the machine with a regular, uniform, and accurate movement. MPP granted to the Precision Machine Company (PMC) a license to manufacture and sell machines embodying the patented invention. The license provided that every machine PMC sold must be sold subject to a restriction and condition that the machine \\"shall be used solely for exhibiting or projecting motion pictures\\" embodying \\"the inventions of reissued letters patent No. 12,192\\"This patent was Thomas Edison's patent on motion picture film, which expired in 1914. and leased by a licensee of [MPP].\\" The license also provided that the machine must have a plate attached to it stating, \\"The sale and purchase of this machine gives only the right to use it solely with moving pictures\\" embodying \\"the inventions of reissued letters patent No. 12,192\\" and leased by a licensee of [MPP].\\"243 U.S. at 506. PMC made and sold one of the patented machines to the owner of the Seventy- Second Street Playhouse (a movie house on 72nd Street in New York City), with a plate containing the required notice. Prague Amusement Company (Prague) then leased the Seventy-Second Street Playhouse, and acquired the machine in question as a part of the equipment of the leased playhouse. Also, at that time, the Universal Film Manufacturing Company (Universal) made two films that were supplied to Prague for use on the machine. Prague used the machine to exhibit the films.243 U.S. at 507. MPP sent letters protesting the alleged infringement of its patent, and then sued Universal, Prague, and the owner of the movie house. It was established at trial that 40,000 of the MPP machines are now in use in the US, and that the patented mechanism is the only one with which motion picture films can be used successfully. The district court held that the post-sale limitation on the use of the machine attempted to be made by the notice attached to it was invalid, and that the purchaser and its lessee had an implied license to use the machine as it had been used. The district court dismissed the case and the Second Circuit affirmed the district court.243 U.S. at 508. Ruling of Supreme Court The Supreme Court, in an opinion written by Justice Clarke affirmed the judgment. Justice Holmes, joined by Justices McKenna and Van Devanter, dissented. Majority opinion Justice Clarke delivered the opinion of the Court =The patent statute= Justice Clarke began his analysis by observing that the patent statute does not provide for and thus authorize notices of the type involved here. Therefore, \\"whatever validity it [the notice] has must be derived from the general, and not from the patent, law.\\"243 U.S. at 509. The statute gives the patentee the exclusive right to make, sell, and use the patented article. In interpreting the statute, three important rules have been declared by the Court: # \\"The scope of every patent is limited to the invention described in the claims.\\" The patentee \\"can claim nothing beyond them.\\" # The statute gives the patentee nothing but the power \\"to restrain others from manufacturing, using, or selling that which he has invented.\\" # \\"Since Pennock v. Dialogue, 2 Pet. 1, was decided in 1829, this Court has consistently held that the primary purpose of our patent laws is not the creation of private fortunes for the owners of patents, but is 'to promote the progress of science and the useful arts.' \\"243 U.S. at 510-11. Accordingly: > These rules of law make it very clear that the scope of the grant which may > be made to an inventor in a patent, pursuant to the statute, must be limited > to the invention described in the claims of his patent, and, to determine > what grant may lawfully be so made, we must hold fast to the language of the > act of Congress providing for it. This patent is only on the film projector mechanism described and claimed in the patent, the Court said. By the same token: > It is not concerned with, and has nothing to do with, the materials with > which or on which the machine operates. The grant is of the exclusive right > to use the mechanism to produce the result with any appropriate material, > and the materials with which the machine is operated are no part of the > patented machine or of the combination which produces the patented result. > The difference is clear and vital between the exclusive right to use the > machine, which the law gives to the inventor, and the right to use it > exclusively with prescribed materials to which such a license notice as we > have here seeks to restrict it.243 U.S. at 511-12. =The rise of the inherency doctrine= Until recently, the Court said, this plain meaning of the statute was generally understood as the law. But with the growth of corporations the idea had arisen \\"of gathering great profits in small payments, which are not realized or resented, from many, rather than smaller or even equal profits in larger payments\\" and so patentees have come to seek to assert \\"the right to restrict the use of [patented machinery] to materials or supplies not described in the patent, and not, by its terms, made a part of the thing patented.\\" A majority of the Supreme Court had accepted that principle several years earlier in Henry v. A.B. Dick Co. The Court traced the evolution of this idea and explained why a majority of the Court rejected it: > The construction of the patent law which justifies as valid the restriction > of patented machines, by notice, to use with unpatented supplies necessary > in the operation of them, but which are no part of them, is believed to have > originated in Heaton-Peninsular Button-Fastener Co. v. Eureka Specialty Co. > (which has come to be widely referred to as the Button-Fastener Case), > decided by . . . the Sixth Circuit in 1896. . . . This decision [Button- > Fastener] proceeds upon the argument that, since the patentee may withhold > his patent altogether from public use, he must logically and necessarily be > permitted to impose any conditions which he chooses upon any use which he > may allow of it. The defect in this thinking springs from the substituting > of inference and argument for the language of the statute, and from failure > to distinguish between the rights which are given to the inventor by the > patent law and which he may assert against all the world through an > infringement proceeding, and rights which he may create for himself by > private contract which, however, are subject to the rules of general as > distinguished from those of the patent, law. While it is true that, under > the statutes as they were (and now are), a patentee might withhold his > patented machine from public use, yet, if he consented to use it himself or > through others, . . . he is thereby restricted to the use of the invention > as it is described in the claims of his patent, and not as it may be > expanded by limitations as to materials and supplies necessary to the > operation of it, imposed by mere notice to the public. The . . . obvious > possibilities for gain in the method which it approved led to an immediate > and widespread adoption of the system, in which these restrictions expanded > into more and more comprehensive forms until at length the case at bar is > reached, with a machine sold and paid for, yet claimed still to be subject > not only to restriction as to supplies to be used, but also subject to any > restrictions or conditions as to use . . . which the company which > authorized its sale may see fit, after the sale, from time to time to > impose. The perfect instrument of favoritism and oppression which such a > system of doing business, if valid, would put into the control of the owner > of such a patent should make courts astute, if need be, to defeat its > operation. If these restrictions were sustained, plainly the plaintiff > might, for its own profit or that of its favorites, . . . ruin anyone > unfortunate enough to be dependent upon its confessedly important > improvements for the doing of business.243 U.S. at 514-15. Justice Clarke denied the legitimacy of this doctrine, because it extended the power of the patent monopoly from the claimed and patented invention‚Äîthe mechanism described in the patent‚Äîto the unpatented supplies used with the mechanism, which were no part of the statutory monopoly: > [F]or the reasons stated in this opinion, we are convinced that the > exclusive right granted in every patent must be limited to the invention > described in the claims of the patent, and that it is not competent for the > owner of a patent, by notice attached to its machine, to in effect extend > the scope of its patent monopoly by restricting the use of it to materials > necessary in its operation, but which are no part of the patented invention, > or to send its machines forth into the channels of trade of the country > subject to conditions as to use or royalty to be paid, to be imposed > thereafter at the discretion of such patent owner. The patent law furnishes > no warrant for such a practice, and the cost, inconvenience, and annoyance > to the public which the opposite conclusion would occasion forbid it.243 > U.S. at 515-16. The Court therefore concluded, first, that Henry v. A.B. Dick must be overruled. Second, the notice on the plate affixed to the machine contains an invalid restriction that the machine must be used only with film embodying the invention of the Edison patent that expired in 1914. \\"[S]uch a film is obviously not any part of the invention of the patent in suit.\\" Therefore, the notice \\"is an attempt, without statutory warrant, to continue the patent monopoly in this particular character of film after it has expired,\\" and to enforce it \\"would be to create a monopoly in the manufacture and use of moving picture films wholly outside of the patent in suit and of the patent law as we have interpreted it.\\" This notice restriction is contrary to public policy: > A restriction which would give to the plaintiff such a potential power for > evil over an industry which must be recognized as an important element in > the amusement life of the nation, under the conclusions we have stated in > this opinion, is plainly void because wholly without the scope and purpose > of our patent laws, and because, if sustained, it would be gravely injurious > to that public interest, which we have seen is more a favorite of the law > than is the promotion of private fortunes.243 U.S. at 518-19. Holmes dissent Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes dissented Justice Holmes had been part of the majority of the Court that endorsed the inherency doctrine in Henry v. A.B. Dick, and he strongly dissented from its rejection and overruling in the Motion Picture Patents case.Holmes was \\"the most consistent defender of\\" this doctrine \\"since its inception.\\" Note, 4 40, 42 (1918). Justices McKenna and Van Devanter, also in the majority in A.B. Dick, joined the Holmes dissent here. Holmes reasoned that a patentee may keep his invention out of use for the term of the patent, for whatever reason he may choose. \\"So much being undisputed, I cannot understand why he may not keep it out of use unless the licensee, or, for the matter of that, the buyer, will use some unpatented thing in connection with it.\\" He added, \\"Non debet, cui plus licet, quod minus est non licere.\\"He who is permitted to do the greater, may with greater reason do the less. This maxim does not take into account whether the public has an interest that is disserved by the acceptance of the condition. See, e.g., Lear, Inc. v. Adkins, 395 U.S. 653 (1969) (holding agreement not to challenge patent validity unenforceable because contrary to public interest in eliminating spurious patents from economy). It does not take into account whether the other party agrees to the condition because it is imposed in a contract of adhesion. See, e.g., West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U.S. 379, 398 (1937) (upholding minimum wage law for women because they were the lowest paid class, with relatively weak bargaining power and the \\"ready victims\\" of those who would take advantage of their status). \\"If the owner prefers to keep the pot unless you will buy his tea, I cannot see, in allowing him the right to do so, anything more than an ordinary incident of ownership.\\" Holmes did allow, however, \\"No doubt this principle might be limited or excluded in cases where the condition tends to bring about a state of things that there is a predominant public interest to prevent.\\" But he was quick to add that in his view \\"there is no predominant public interest to prevent a patented teapot or film feeder from being kept from the public, because, as I have said, the patentee may keep them tied up at will while his patent lasts.\\" He also saw no problem in the alleged extension of the patent monopoly from the claimed mechanism to the films made the condition of use of the mechanism. That effect occurs \\"only to the extent of the desire for the teapot or film feeder, and if the owner prefers to keep the pot or the feeder unless you will buy his tea or films, I cannot see, in allowing him the right to do so, anything more than an ordinary incident of ownership.\\"243 U.S. at 519-20. Subsequent developments The Motion Picture Patents case is often credited with forming the basis for the Supreme Court's creation of an equitable defense of patent misuse to a claim of patent infringement.See, e.g., Vincent Chiapetta, Living with Patents: Insights from Patent Misuse, 15 1, 4 n.15 (\\"The first inklings of misuse are found in the Supreme Court's 1917 decision in Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co.) (2011); id. at 15 (\\"The doctrine's origins trace back to the Court's 1917 decision in Motion Picture Patents Co.); Matthew W. Siegal and Claude G. Szyfer, Supreme Court Relaxes View of Tying Patents, 235 N.Y.L.J. 1, 2 (Mar. 27, 2006). To the extent, however, that the misuse doctrine (at least when it applies to sold patented articles and restricts purchasers' use of the articles) is an aspect or outgrowth of the exhaustion doctrine, it is preceded by such decisions as Adams v. Burke.. Carbice Im Carbice Corp. v. American Patents Development Corp.,. the Supreme Court considered a case in which a patentee, who had a patent on a \\"package consisting of a protective casing of insulating material having packed therein a quantity of frozen carbon dioxide [\\"dry ice\\"] in an insulating container and a quantity of freezable product in freezing proximity to said frozen carbon dioxide,\\" where the frozen carbon dioxide was placed at the center, surrounded by the freezable product, surrounded on the outside by the packaging material. The patentee's exclusive licensee sold dry ice to its customers with an implied license to use the container invention without the payment of royalty, but subject to the condition that the customers use the dry ice only with containers from a designated source and that they use the containers only with dry ice bought from the licensee. Carbice, the defendant in this case, sold dry ice with knowledge that it would be used by the purchasers in packages like those described in the patent. The patentee and exclusive licensee sued Carbice for contributing to infringement by the purchasers of its dry ice. The Supreme Court said: > The relief here sought is indistinguishable from that denied in the Motion > Picture Case. There, it was held that to permit the patent owner to \\"derive > its profit not from the invention on which the law gives it a monopoly, but > from the unpatented supplies with which it is used\\" is \\"wholly without the > scope of the patent monopoly.\\" If a monopoly could be so expanded, the owner > of a patent for a product might conceivably monopolize the commerce in a > large part of unpatented materials used in its manufacture. The owner of a > patent for a machine might thereby secure a partial monopoly on the > unpatented supplies consumed in its operation. The owner of a patent for a > process might secure a partial monopoly on the unpatented material employed > in it.283 U.S. at 31-32. The Court therefore denied relief for the claimed infringement. Leitch v. Barber In Leitch Manufacturing Co. v. Barber Co.,. the Supreme Court extended the doctrine of the Motion Picture Case case. Barber had a patent on a process for improving the curing of concrete pavement by spreading tar on it to inhibit evaporation (thereby giving the water molecules more time to bond to the concrete and make it harder). Leitch sold tar to a road builder, knowing that it was to be used in accordance with the patented method. Barber sued Leitch for contributory infringement. Barber had exploited his patent by selling tar to road builders with the understanding that they could use the patented method with Barber's tar; it granted no written license. Barber argued that Carbice did not apply because it granted no license on a condition of tying supplies. The Court said that it had adopted \\"a method of doing the business which is the practical equivalent of granting a written license with a condition that the patented method may be practiced\\" only with tar purchased from it.\\" Accordingly, \\"the sole purpose to which the patent is put is thereby to suppress competition in the production and sale of staple unpatented material for this use in road building.\\" The Court held that the doctrine of the Carbice case applied: > By the rule there declared every use of a patent as a means of obtaining a > limited monopoly of unpatented material is prohibited. It applies whether > the patent be for a machine, a product, or a process. It applies whatever > the nature of the device by which the owner of the patent seeks to effect > such unauthorized extension of the monopoly. Morton Salt Morton Salt Co. v. G.S. Suppiger Co.,. was the first case in which the Court expressly labeled as \\"misuse\\" the Motion Picture Patent/Carbice defense to a charge of patent infringement and created the present blanket remedy in infringement cases of unenforceability of the misused patent.The Court stated: \\"Equity may rightly withhold its assistance from such a use of the patent by declining to entertain a suit for infringement, and should do so at least until it is made to appear that the improper practice has been abandoned and that the consequences of the misuse of the patent have been dissipated.\\" 314 U.S. at 493. Suppiger had a patent on a machine for dispensing salt tablets into food cans in the canning process. It leased the patented machines to canners and required lessee/licensees of its patent to buy their salt tablets used in the machines from its subsidiary. Morton leased machines to the canners that Suppiger charged infringed its patent. Based on these facts, the Court said, \\"It thus appears that [Suppiger] is making use of its patent monopoly to restrain competition in the marketing of unpatented articles, salt tablets, for use with the patented machines, and is aiding in the creation of a limited monopoly in the tablets not within that granted by the patent.\\" Citing Motion Picture Patents, Carbice, and Leitch, the Court stated, \\"It is the established rule that a patentee who has granted a license on condition that the patented invention be used by the licensee only with unpatented materials furnished by the licensor may not restrain as a contributory infringer one who sells to the licensee like materials for like use.\\" Such conduct is contrary to the public policy of the United States: > [T]he the public policy which includes inventions within the granted > monopoly excludes from it all that is not embraced in the invention. It > equally forbids the use of the patent to secure an exclusive right or > limited monopoly not granted by the Patent Office and which it is contrary > to public policy to grant. Courts of equity may withhold their aid from a party that asserts a right that it is using contrary to the public interest. Suppiger argued that Motion Picture Patents, Carbice, and Leitch all involved contributory infringement actions where the patentee sought to restrain a defendant from selling unpatented supplies to licensees, but here, Suppiger said: * Suppiger does not ask the courts to order Morton to stop competing in the sale of salt. * Rather, Suppiger just asks the courts to order Morton to stop directly infringing the patent. * The equity maxim that a party seeking the aid of a court of equity must come into court with \\"clean hands\\" applies only to the plaintiff's wrongful conduct in the particular act or transaction as to which equity enforcement is sought. * Therefore, the maxim involved in those cases does not apply to the different transaction‚Äîdirect infringement‚Äîinvolved here. The Court did not accept the attempted distinction: > [A]dditional considerations must be taken into account where maintenance of > the suit concerns the public interest, as well as the private interests of > suitors. Where the patent is used as a means of restraining competition with > the patentee's sale of an unpatented product, the successful prosecution of > an infringement suit, even against one who is not a competitor in such sale, > is a powerful aid to the maintenance of the attempted monopoly of the > unpatented article, and is thus a contributing factor in thwarting the > public policy underlying the grant of the patent. The Court explained that equity precedent supported denial of relief that would further wrongdoing by the party seeking the relief and thus harm the public interest: > Equity may rightly withhold its assistance from such a use of the patent by > declining to entertain a suit for infringement, and should do so at least > until it is made to appear that the improper practice has been abandoned and > that the consequences of the misuse of the patent have been dissipated. > > The reasons for barring the prosecution of such a suit against one who is > not a competitor with the patentee in the sale of the unpatented product are > fundamentally the same as those which preclude an infringement suit against > a licensee who has violated a condition of the license by using with the > licensed machine a competing unpatented article [as protection] Motion > Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co. . . . It is the adverse > effect upon the public interest of a successful infringement suit in > conjunction with the patentee's course of conduct which disqualifies him to > maintain the suit, regardless of whether the particular defendant has > suffered from the misuse of the patent. These considerations made it unnecessary, the Court added, to decide whether Suppiger had committed an antitrust violation \\"for we conclude that, in any event, the maintenance of the present suit to restrain petitioner's manufacture or sale of the alleged infringing machines is contrary to public policy, and that the district court rightly dismissed the complaint for want of equity.\\" Kimble v. Marvel In Kimble v. Marvel in 2015, after some years of lower court disapproval and disregard of the patent misuse doctrine developed in Motion Picture Patents, Carbice, and Suppiger, the Supreme Court reaffirmed its principles. In particular, the Court rejected the argument that patent misuse should track antitrust doctrine and insisted that patent misuse is based on patent policy rather than antitrust policy. This is not to say that an antitrust violation will not usually be the basis for holding unenforceable the patents misused in committing the antitrust violation,See United States Gypsum Co. v. National Gypsum Co., 352 U.S. 457 (1957), in which the Court found misuse based on the antitrust violation previously found in United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U. S. 364 (1948), \\"because patent misuse was the essence of the old antitrust litigation,\\" 352 U.S. at 464. but rather that the misuse doctrine prohibits even conduct that does not rise (or sink) to the level of an antitrust violation,Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 100 (1969). and where antitrust does not reach challenged conduct patent misuse will do so if patent policy so requires. Commentary ‚óè A very terse contemporary comment by \\"A.M.K.\\" in the California Law Review on the Motion Picture Patents case and its overruling of A.B. Dick and the Button-Fastener case stated what the following commentary by Professor Chiapetta explains in greater detail some years later. A.M.K. said: > It by no means follows that because a patentee may withhold the use of the > patented article entirely he may license its use with any conditions he > chooses. It may be better that the public should not enjoy the article at > all than that it should be used under restrictions obnoxious to public > policy.Comment, Restraint of Trade: Common Law: Patents, 5 425, 428 (1917). ‚óè A 1918 Note in the Iowa Law Review is critical of the Holmes dissent as well. \\"Mr. Justice Holmes, who has been the most consistent defender of the restriction theory since its inception, argues in the latest decision that since the patentee may wholly withdraw his invention from the market, he should be permitted to sell it on any terms or conditions he may wish to impose.\\" The Note writer says: > The difficulty with this reasoning is that if it proves anything, it proves > too much. If it is true that because a man may withhold a patented article > from the market, he may therefore impose any conditions upon its use when he > sells, it should be equally true that because a man owns a horse that he > need not sell, he may at the time of sale impose any conditions upon its > future use. But that cannot be a valid test, he continues, because it is against the common law. \\"It is a general rule that covenants do not run with personalty and contracts restricting the use or resale of personalty cannot be annexed to the chattel so as to follow and obligate the purchaser by notice,\\" citing Coke and other authorities.Note, The Right of the Patentee To Control the Use or Price of a Patented Article Upon Resale, 4 40, 42 (1918). Coke on Littleton ¬ß 360, for example, gives a restraint accompanying the sale of a horse as an illustration of the invalidity of a post‚Äìsale restraint. ‚óè New York patent attorney (later Federal Circuit judge) Giles Rich commented that \\"the patent law 'went on a spree from 1896 to 1917.' \\"Giles Rich, The Relation Between Patent Practices and the Anti-Monopoly Laws, 24 85, 88 (1942). ‚óè Professor Chiapetta compares the majority's and Holmes's dissent's respective analyses of the inherency doctrine and concludes that Holmes's analysis ignores the issue of whether the benefits of increased usage of the patented invention under a restrictive license exceed the harms resulting from the restriction. He concedes, for purposes of a \\"Chicago School\\" analysis, that it is true that any increased access produces some efficiency improvement. It is not true, however, he insists, that every increase in access produces a net improvement: \\"That determination requires examining the harms produced by the terms of access. If those harms exceed the benefits then the transaction reduces efficient market operation overall and should be legally prohibited.\\" He explains, further, that a patentee's simple refusal to license a patent may lead to loss of efficiency but the costs are those arising from the existence of the patent system. \\"If that produces net inefficiencies, the problem lies exclusively\\" in the way the U.S. patent system has been set up, which is a matter of congressional choice, subject only to constitutional limitations. Privately constructed terms of access (licensing conditions) can produce additional costs, which may arise from effects of imposing conditions on the licensee. \\"As the Motion Picture majority properly observes, such rights must be examined to determine whether their harms outweigh the benefits.\\"Chiapetta at 26-27. The determination of what constitutes a legally cognizable harm that may be balanced off against the benefits of increased access, to decide what is the net harm or benefit \\"is the purview of general laws.\\" These include contract, tort, and antitrust laws. Unless the constraints of the general law are taken into account, he argues: > [I]ncreased access may, in efficiency terms, be worse for society than no > access at all. While the latter merely produces patent law's internal net > system efficiency improvement (additional innovation justifying the costs of > reduced access), the former can impose additional costs producing a net > overall efficiency decrease. Such transactions must be legally prohibited. The proper question, Chiapatta insists, is whether the majority's or Holmes's legal doctrine better contributes to accomplishing the goal of net overall efficiency increase.Chiapetta at 27.

When Vic was two years old they moved to Victoria, BC and later Cordova Bay, a municipality of Victoria. In an article in the Spindrift', a paper created by the Cordova Bay Community Club, May 1948 Vol1. No.5 on page 6 you will find Lindal's father listed as a member of the Cordova Bay Community Club.

Lindal grew up in an athletic family, and you can find his father's name once again in the old Spindrift Newspaper as the Community's sports director February 1955 on page3.  Career  Lindal was the manager of the first Canadian Women's volleyball team in 1967, and Head Coach of the second Canadian Women's Volleyball team. He is the founder of the Pacific Rim Volleyball Championships, BC High School Girls, and BC High School Boys Volleyball programs, Japan / BC volleyball exchange programme, and co-founder of the BC Volleyball Association, and founder of the first ever Volleyball Camp in North America at Winfield, BC. Lindal was the BC Provincial Volleyball Coach in 1977. Lindal was a colour commentator in the Sport of Volleyball at four Olympic Games; Montreal, Quebec in 1976 with CBC, Los Angeles, USA in 1984 with CBC, Seoul, Korea in 1988 with CBC, and Barcelona in 1992 with CTV. He was the first Volleyball Commentator for TSN, and commentated all major Canadian Volleyball events such as the CIAU and Canadian Beach Volleyball Championships. On 16 September 2002 Lindal won the Investor's Sport Administration Award. Before Volleyball, Lindal was a successful athlete in many sports, including badminton, where he won the Victoria under 18Doubles Championships in 1955. He spoke at many camps and conferences regarding the need for mental training and visualization, and this led to co-authoring the book, Endpoint Vision, and co-authoring the audio book, 90% Mental7 Mental Secrets to Success In Hockey  Achievements  *Lindal was inducted into the Canadian Volleyball Hall of Fame in 2000, the BC Sports Hall of Fame in 2001, and the Great Victoria Sports Hall of Fame in 2003. *Lindal won seven Canadian National Volleyball Championships as Head Coach, five with the Vancouver Calonas Women‚Äôs Team, one for Midget Boys (under 16)m and one for the Juvenile Men division. He took Canada's National Women's Team to Canada's first-ever victory over the USA in the early 1970s.  Later years  Lindal used the most modern techniques in his instruction, whether as a volleyball coach or as a physical education teacher in the 1960s. Lindal completed the Iron Man triathlon at age 50. He rode his mountain bike from Victoria, BC to Manitoba at the age of 70, to fight what he calls, AADD Adult Adventure Deficit Disorder. Lindal, at the age of 78, continues to be an active member of ToastMasters International, and is a personal coach and mentor to many clients.

Gray's neck and spine were injured while he was in a police vehicle and he went into a coma. On April 18, there were protests in front of the Western district police station. Gray died on April 19. Further protests were organized after Gray's death became public knowledge, amid the police department's continuing inability to adequately or consistently explain the events following the arrest and the injuries. Spontaneous protests started after the funeral service, although several included violent elements. Civil unrest continued with at least twenty police officers injured, at least 250 people arrested, 285 to 350 businesses damaged, 150 vehicle fires, 60 structure fires, 27 drugstores looted, thousands of police and Maryland National Guard troops deployed, and with a state of emergency declared in the city limits of Baltimore. The state of emergency was lifted on May 6. The series of protests took place against a historical backdrop of racial and poverty issues in Baltimore. On May 1, 2015, Gray's death was ruled by the medical examiner to be a homicide. Six officers were charged with various offenses, including second-degree murder, in connection with Gray's death. Three officers were subsequently acquitted; in July 2016, following the acquittals, Baltimore City State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby dropped charges against the remaining three officers.Sherl Gay Stolberg & Jess Bidgood, All Charges Dropped Against Baltimore Officers in Freddie Gray Case, The New York Times (July 27, 2016). Events April 12: Gray's arrest On April 12, 2015, Freddie Carlos Gray, Jr., a 25-year-old African-American man, was arrested by the Baltimore City Police Department for possession of a ‚Äúswitchblade‚Äù, in the 1700 block of Presbury Street in the Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood. Two weeks later, State‚Äôs Attorney Marilyn Mosby revealed that Gray had actually been carrying a legal pocketknife, not an illegal switchblade as alleged by police. Gray was seen to be in good health at the time of the arrest. While being transported in a police van, Gray sustained injuries to his neck, including his vocal box and spinal cord. He fell into a coma and was taken to a trauma center. The BCPD could not immediately account for the injuries and released contradictory and inconsistent information regarding the timeline of the arrest, transportation and whether Gray had received appropriately prompt medical treatment. On May 23, 2016, officer Edward Nero was found not guilty of all charges against him in connection with the death of Freddie Gray. Shortly after that, the remaining officers who had not yet stood trial had all charges against them dropped. April 18‚Äì24: Protests begin On April 18, 2015, immediately outside the Western District police station, hundreds of Baltimore citizens protested against the apparent mistreatment of Freddie Gray as well against inadequate and inconsistent information on police actions during the arrest and transport. Gray died at approximately 7am on April 19, 2015. Later that day, in response to Gray's death, Baltimore City Police Commissioner, Anthony Batts said, \\"I extend my deepest sympathies to his family\\" while also saying, \\"All Lives Matter\\" in a nod to the \\"Black Lives Matter\\" mantra shouted at protests. Protests continued during six nights in Baltimore's streets. On April 21, 2015, the Baltimore City Police Department released the identities of the six officers involved in Gray's arrest. That evening, protesters marched from the site of Gray's arrest to the Western District police station. On April 23, two people were arrested. Tensions flared, but according to the Baltimore City Police Department, the remaining protesters that day were peaceful. On April 24, a coalition of organizations including the ACLU, the NAACP, CASA de Maryland, and Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle requested Governor Larry Hogan to act and address issues of police brutality. April 25: Violence escalates Rioters breaking the windows of a McDonald's restaurant on the evening of April 25, 2015 On April 25, 2015, protests were organized in downtown Baltimore. Protesters marched from the Baltimore City Hall to the Inner Harbor. After the final stage of the official protest event, some people became violent, damaging at least five police vehicles and pelting police with rocks. Near Oriole Park at Camden Yards, some groups of violent protesters also smashed storefronts and fought with baseball fans arriving at the stadium for a scheduled game between the Baltimore Orioles and the Boston Red Sox. As a result of the violence, those attending the baseball game were forced to remain inside the stadium for their safety. At least 34 people were arrested during the riots, and six police officers were injured.Wenger, Yvonne; Campbell, Colin. City leader calls for peace after 35 arrested, 6 officers injured, The Baltimore Sun, April 26, 2015. J.M. Giordano, a photographer for Baltimore City Paper, was taking pictures of the protest when he was \\"swarmed\\" and beaten by two police officers in riot gear. Sait Serkan Gurbuz, a Reuters photographer with visible press credentials, who photographed the scuffle from a public sidewalk, was tackled, handcuffed and walked to the Western District station. He was cited for failure to obey and later released. Subsequently, City Paper published a video on its website documenting the violence. During a press conference, Baltimore mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said, \\"most protesters were respectful but a small group of agitators intervened\\". She also stated that \\"It's a very delicate balancing act. Because while we try to make sure that they were protected from the cars and other things that were going on, we also gave those who wished to destroy space to do that as well. And we worked very hard to keep that balance and to put ourselves in the best position to de-escalate.\\"Baltimore Mayor: ‚ÄòGave Those Who Wished to Destroy Space to Do That‚Äô, CBS News Baltimore, April 25, 2015 The phrase \\"we also gave those who wished to destroy space to do that as well\\" was interpreted by some conservative-leaning news sources as an indication that the mayor was giving permission to protesters to destroy property. Two days later, the mayor's Director of Strategic Planning and Policy, Howard Libit, released a statement clarifying the mayor's remarks: April 27 =Funeral= A funeral service was held for Freddie Gray at the New Shiloh Baptist Church on April 27 at 11 a.m., after a one-hour public viewing. A large attendance included civil rights leaders, families of other people killed by police, and politicians including Congressman Elijah Cummings, Cabinet Secretary Broderick Johnson, White House adviser Heather Foster, and Elias Alcantara of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs. Gray is buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in Baltimore County, Maryland. =Preemptive actions= A photograph of the April 25 rioters standing on a Baltimore police car was superimposed with the text \\"All HighSchools Monday @3 We Are Going To Purge From Mondawmin To The Ave, Back To Downtown #Fdl\\" (\\"Purge\\" being a reference to the film series)Image cited in The New York Times \\"Mapping the Clashes\\" and distributed on social media and as flyers. In response, Mondawmin Mall was closed at 2:15 p.m. and police in riot gear were deployed to the area. In preparation for the 'purge' police shut down the Mondawmin metro stop and also blockaded many of the nearby streets. As a result, students from Frederick Douglass High School, which is across the street from Mondawmin Mall, had considerable difficulty leaving the area via public transportation when their classes ended an hour after the \\"purge\\" began, and contributed to the swelling crowd. According to eyewitness reports, expecting the \\"purge\\" to start at 3 p.m., Baltimore police pre-emptively de- boarded all buses going through the area, shut down the nearby Mondawmin Metro station and cordoned off the area around the mall. Eyewitnesses saw police detain students in that general area. The police, in full riot gear, detained the students for a full half-hour before the first brick was thrown. Meghann Harris, a teacher in the Baltimore school system, said on Facebook, \\"If I were a Douglass[sic] student that just got trapped in the middle of a minefield BY cops without any way to get home and completely in harm's way, I'd be ready to pop off, too.\\" Other closings in preparation or response to the riot included the University of Maryland Baltimore, which closed its campus in downtown Baltimore at 2:00 p.m. citing a police warning regarding \\"activities (that) may be potentially violent and UMB could be in the path of any violence\\", Baltimore City Community College, Coppin State University, the Lexington Market, the National Aquarium, and the Enoch Pratt Free Library system. The Baltimore Kinetic Sculpture Race was rescheduled from May 2 to June 14. A Baltimore Orioles baseball game against the Chicago White Sox scheduled for the evening at Oriole Park at Camden Yards, and the first of a three-game series, was also postponed due to the unrest. =Spread of violence= Initially 75‚Äì100 people who appeared to be high school students began throwing bricks and bottles at police near Mondawmin Mall after police refused high school students access to their primary means of getting home (the transportation hub at Mondawmin Mall), while ordering them to disperse and go home. The violence rapidly spread, and by later that day two patrol cars were destroyed and fifteen officers were injured. A police cruiser was destroyed, and some officers suffered broken bones. A CVS Pharmacy location in West Baltimore was looted and burned by rioters; no one in the CVS was hurt because employees had been evacuated before the CVS was looted and burned, but a fire hose used later to put out the CVS fire was punctured by a rioter. In East Baltimore, the Mary Harvin Senior Center, an under-construction senior housing and services project, burned to the ground; it was rebuilt and opened in April 2016.http://www.wbaltv.com/news/mary-harvin-senior-center-reopens-year-after- fire/39245836 April 28 =Morning= 175th Infantry Regiment keeps watch in front of Baltimore City Hall on April 28 At about 6:00 a.m., Baltimore television showed firefighters putting out fires and residents cleaning up after the overnight rioting. Soldiers from the 1st Battalion, 175th Infantry Regiment, Maryland Army National Guard arrived in Baltimore to provide security to vital infrastructure and to give additional support to police. At about 7:35 a.m., the Baltimore mayor's office reported that there were 144 vehicle fires, 15 structural fires, and nearly 200 arrests. One person had been badly hurt due to an arson. At 8:25 a.m., it was announced that Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan was temporarily moving his office from Annapolis to Baltimore and that Hogan would visit scenes around Baltimore. At approximately 9:00 a.m., Hogan visited an intersection on West Baltimore that was heavily affected by the rioting with damaged vehicles and a looted convenience store, thanking those in the area for help cleaning up the streets. In one incident that went viral during the previous night, Baltimore mother, Toya Graham, repeatedly struck and berated her son on TV for throwing rocks at police. Graham stated that she didn't want her son to end up like Freddie Gray, but also that he shouldn't seek justice by rioting. At 11:15 a.m. on April 28, Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony Batts praised Graham, stating, \\"I wish I had more parents that took charge of their kids out there.\\" Baltimore County police spokesman Cpl. John Wachter also announced that Security Square Mall was going to be closed for the rest of the day following the spreading of rumors that planned actions were going to occur there. The Social Security Administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services also closed. =Afternoon and evening= At 12:00 p.m. in the area where Freddie Gray was arrested, volunteers numbering in the hundreds were seen cleaning up debris left from the rioting. Police blocked off some of the area to assist with the cleanup while hardware stores in the neighborhood donated trash bags and brooms and city workers drove in trucks to carry away piles of trash and shattered glass. At 12:55 p.m., President Obama stated that there have been too many worrying interactions between police and black citizens, but said there was \\"no excuse\\" for the violence of rioters in Baltimore. At about 1:30 p.m., crowds gathered at a damaged drug store where Rev. Jesse Jackson was visiting, with Jackson stating, \\"It was painful because it destroyed a lot of neighborhood businesses and hurt a lot of people, but the violence is driven by that alienation.\\" At a 2:30 p.m. speaking event by Capt. Eric Kowalczyk discussing incidents that occurred on April 27, demonstrators gathered peacefully, though one individual was arrested and pepper spray was used when some protesters became disorderly. At 3:00 p.m., Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake took back comments calling rioters \\"thugs\\", saying that occasionally, \\"my little anger interpreter gets the best of me.\\" Baltimore religious leaders announced that 14 churches throughout the city were open to give food to children that relied on schools to provide daily meals. At 8:30 p.m., the CEO of Baltimore City Public Schools, Gregory Thornton, announced that Baltimore City Public School classes and after-school events would occur on April 29. Just before 9:00 p.m., several hundred protesters gathered around the CVS store that was looted, with some individuals separating the protesters and police, while a local pastor told demonstrators over a loud speaker to respect the curfew, saying, \\"Let's show the world, because the eyes of the world are on Baltimore right now.\\" A police spokesman, Captain Eric Kowalczyk, stated that authorities were attempting to inform Baltimore residents of the 10:00 p.m. curfew in multiple ways, through police in patrol cars, sending messages through a police helicopter over the city and by calling residents through a Reverse 911 system. Baltimore riot policemen form a line to push back protesters and media members on April 28 At 10:15 p.m., hundreds of demonstrators, some throwing bottles at police, remained in the streets while police in riot gear began to move the crowds with speakers from helicopters overhead broadcasting, \\"You must go home. You cannot remain here. You will be subject to arrest.\\" Tensions began to grow after individuals began to throw objects at police. Shortly after 10:30 p.m., smoke bombs or fireworks were thrown from the crowd and police equipped with riot shields began to slowly advance on the gathering with some people beginning to disperse. At 10:32 p.m., Baltimore Police tweeted that \\"Officers are now deploying pepper balls at the aggressive crowd\\". They then tweeted at 10:34 p.m. \\"People who remain on the street ‚Äì who do not meet the exceptions ‚Äì are now in violation of the emergency curfew\\" with police moving across the intersection and the crowd dispersing down side streets away from the area. At 10:50 p.m., military vehicles were seen driving through the streets to disperse the remaining crowd numbered with dozens of people. At 11:00 p.m., the CVS intersection was clear except for police and media workers who were exempt from the curfew. At 11:40 p.m., Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony Batts stated that the curfew seemed to work and that ten people were arrested; seven for violating the curfew, two people for looting and one for disorderly conduct. Between start of curfew and late night, thirty-five people, including one juvenile, had been arrested for violating the curfew. April 29 ‚Äì May 3 After the riots, many small business owners struggled to clean up. Over 200 small businesses were unable to reopen by April 29. Residents of all ages, genders, and races came together to help clean Baltimore's streets. Eighteen were arrested for curfew violations on April 29. Protesters gathered in front of Baltimore City Hall on April 30 From April 29-May 3, 2015 FBI surveillance aircraft used FLIR cameras to record video of civil unrest. In August 2016, 18 hours of footage was released following a FOIA request from the American Civil Liberties Union. By April 30, over forty Korean American-owned businesses had been damaged by the riots. Chinese American and Arab American owned stores were also targeted, with looters directed by African American gangs towards those businesses. Forty people were arrested for such night violations on May 1. After the largest peaceful rally on Saturday, May 2, 2015, 46 people were arrested during the night time curfew. One person arrested on May 2 was News2Share journalist Ford Fischer. He was handcuffed and initially charged with violating curfew, despite the police confirming that he was credentialed media. After confirming the charge as \\"curfew violation\\" to another journalist, the police changed it to a civil citation for \\"Disorderly Conduct.\\" As of May 21, he still faces that citation. This all came after the police department had confirmed that media are exempt from the curfew via Twitter. The night curfew on the city was lifted on May 3. Meanwhile, all charges against violators were dropped. It was found that in section 14-107 of the state's public safety code, only the governor and not the mayor has the authority to issue a curfew. It was decided that the arrests of violators were punishment enough. Those who committed violations of the law other than curfew violations have still been prosecuted. The Maryland National Guard withdrew completely from Baltimore on May 4. Result of investigation Initially, the Baltimore Police Department suspended six officers with pay pending an investigation of Gray's death.http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/21/us/baltimore-freddie-gray-death/index.html The six officers involved in the arrest were identified as Lieutenant Brian Rice, Sergeant Alicia White, Officer William Porter, Officer Garrett Miller, Officer Edward Nero, and Officer Caesar Goodson.Miller, Jayne. 6 officers suspended in Freddie Gray case, WBAL, April 20, 2015. Retrieved April 30, 2015. On April 24, 2015, Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said, \\"We know our police employees failed to get him medical attention in a timely manner multiple times.\\" Batts also acknowledged police did not follow procedure when they failed to buckle Gray in the van while he was being transported to the police station. The U.S. Department of Justice also opened an investigation into the case. Charges filed, acquittals, and charges dropped On May 1, 2015, after receiving a medical examiner's report ruling Gray's death a homicide, state prosecutors said that they had probable cause to file criminal charges against the six officers involved. Mosby said that the Baltimore police had acted illegally and that \\"No crime had been committed [by Freddie Gray]\\". Mosby said that Gray \\"suffered a critical neck injury as a result of being handcuffed, shackled by his feet and unrestrained inside the BPD wagon.\\" Mosby said officers had \\"failed to establish probable cause for Mr. Gray's arrest, as no crime had been committed\\", and charged officers with false imprisonment, because Gray was carrying a pocket knife of legal size, and not the switchblade police claimed he had possessed at the time of his arrest. All six officers were taken into custody and processed at Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Center. The trial of Officer William G. Porter, a black officer and the first of the six charged officers to go to trial, ended in a mistrial. The Prosecution had intended to have Porter testify against both his supervisor on the day, Sgt. Alicia White, and the driver of the van, Officer Caesar Goodson Jr. The trials ran into significant delays due to multiple motions being filed by both sides in the cases. On May 23, 2016, Officer Edward Nero was found not guilty on all four counts he was charged with, including two counts of misconduct in office, misdemeanor reckless endangerment, and misdemeanor assault in the second degree. In addition to Nero, two others officers were subsequently acquitted. In July 2016, following the acquittals, Baltimore City State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby dropped charges against Porter and the remaining two officers. Related protests Policemen surround protesters at East 19th Street in New York City. On April 29, 2015, protesters marched through New York City, blocking off traffic in key areas, including the Holland Tunnel and West Side Highway. Carmen Perez, director of the criminal justice reform group Justice League, said, \\"It's all about solidarity, We're here to spread the message of peace from Baltimore's initial protests.\\" More than 100 people were arrested, and the police did not allow the protest to take form before making arrests. Anti-police brutality protests were also held in Denver in solidarity with the Baltimore protests. Eleven people were arrested on April 29, 2015 following physical altercations in which police used pepper spray on protesters who rallied around Colfax Avenue and Broadway street. The confrontation occurred shortly after 7 p.m. when an officer was knocked off his motorcycle by a protester and assaulted by five others. Police reported force was used in response to the incident. By 7:40 p.m., Broadway street was cleared for traffic as protesters relocated to the 16th Street Mall. There were also solidarity protests in the cities of Ann Arbor, Albuquerque, Boston, Cincinnati, Minneapolis, Oakland, Philadelphia, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. Reactions Preventive actions =Government actions= At a press conference in the evening, the mayor announced there would be a citywide curfew of 10:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. starting April 28. The Baltimore solicitor's office stated that a limitation of the curfew to only certain neighborhoods could potentially be viewed as racial discrimination. Neighboring Anne Arundel and Baltimore Counties cancelled school field trips and activities scheduled in Baltimore City until May 3. Officials also announced that Baltimore's city schools would be closed on Tuesday. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan declared a state of emergency and activated the Maryland National Guard. Major General Linda Singh of the Maryland National Guard commented that there would be a \\"massive number\\" of soldiers in Maryland on the night of April 27, and that up to 5,000 soldiers could be deployed. Maryland State Police activated 500 officers for duty in Baltimore, and requested an additional 5,000 state police officers from other states. Business owners in the city complained that the curfew required establishments with later hours to close their doors early, thereby costing them revenue from later hours customers and hurting their employees by forcing them to work fewer hours. Some businesses complained that the curfew cost them as much as $50,000. While those with night jobs were given an exemption to be allowed to travel to work, early closing hours continued to cost employees work hours. Despite criticism of curfew enforcement, Mayor Rawlings-Blake stood by the curfew, saying it was necessary to maintain control. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch requested an independent civil rights investigation into the Freddie Gray case in hopes of calming the violence in Baltimore. =Sports actions= The Baltimore Ravens had canceled their NFL Draft party in response to the riots. After consulting with Major League Baseball, the Baltimore Orioles announced that their second game in a series against the Chicago White Sox would also be postponed, and that their game on April 29 would be played in the afternoon behind closed doors. This was believed to be the first behind closed doors game in Major League Baseball history (it is occasionally seen in soccer as punishment for spectator behavior). The attendance for the game was officially recorded as zero, thus breaking the previous record (of six, set in 1882) for the lowest attendance at a Major League Baseball game.Dan Connolly, Orioles start fast in empty park, emerge from surreal day with 8‚Äì2 win over White Sox, The Baltimore Sun (April 29, 2015). Retrieved May 1, 2015. The two cancelled games were made up as a doubleheader on May 28. The team also moved its May 1‚Äì3 series against the Tampa Bay Rays from Camden Yards to Tropicana Field, but still played as the home team (despite the Rays hosting it). =Gang involvement= After Baltimore police determined there was a \\"credible threat\\" of gang violence against police officers across the country, many departments across the US heightened their security in response: for example the Los Angeles Police Department ordered their officers to ride in pairs. Baltimore police claimed evidence to support the idea that the Black Guerrilla Family, the Bloods, and the Crips were \\"teaming up\\" to target police officers. Later, however, leaders of both the Bloods and the Crips denied the allegations, released a video statement asking for calm and peaceful protest in the area, and joined with police and clergy to enforce the curfew. At one occasion, gang members helped to prevent a riot at the Security Square Mall by dispersing would-be rioters. On other occasions, rival gang members helped each other to protect black- owned businesses, black children, and reporters, diverting rioters to Korean-, Chinese-, and Arab-owned businesses instead. On yet another occasion, the Bloods, the Crips, and the Nation of Islam were seen taking a picture together and working together to dispel violence while peacefully demonstrating. Critical opinions On April 28, President Barack Obama strongly condemned the violence during a White House press conference, saying, \\"There's no excuse for the kind of violence that we saw yesterday. It is counterproductive. ... When individuals get crowbars and start prying open doors to loot, they're not protesting. They're not making a statement. They're stealing. When they burn down a building, they're committing arson. And they're destroying and undermining businesses and opportunities in their own communities. That robs jobs and opportunity from people in that area.\\" Obama went on to applaud the actions of peaceful protesters who he felt were being undermined by the violence, and called upon the nation to take meaningful action to collectively solve poverty and law enforcement issues fueling what he described as \\"a crisis\\". On social media and elsewhere, Mayor Rawlings-Blake and President Obama were criticized for calling the rioters \\"thugs\\" on April 28. When asked about the postponement of the Baltimore Orioles game, the Orioles' chief operating officer, John P. Angelos, said:  Online reaction  The protests were originally covered on social media with the hashtag #BaltimoreRiots. However, by April 28, the more popular hashtag to cover the protests became #BaltimoreUprising. The change may have occurred in response to a decline in violent actions, or may have been the promotion of a new political narrative by social media users. Dr. Denise Meringolo, an Associate Professor and public historian at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and Joe Tropea, Curator of Films & Photographs at the Maryland Historical Society, co-founded the Preserve the Baltimore Uprising digital archive to capture images and oral histories related to the protests directly from the local community.  Increase in violence and decrease in policing  Baltimore recorded 43 homicides in the month of May, the second deadliest month on record and the worst since December 1971 when 44 homicides were recorded. There have also been more than 100 non-fatal shootings in May 2015. Police commissioner Anthony Batts blames looted drugs, stolen from 27 pharmacies and two methadone clinics, as well as street distribution and turf wars for the spike in crime. The increase in shootings has occurred along with a 50% decline in arrests since the charging of six officers in Gray's death in custody. The heavy police presence in crime-ridden neighborhoods is no longer apparent with one resident stating, \\"Before it was over-policing. Now there's no police.\\" One officer speaking anonymously stated, \\"After the protests, it seems like the citizens would appreciate a lack of police presence, and that's exactly what they're getting.\\" Batts stated that his officers are \\"not holding back\\" despite encountering hostility in the Western District whenever they make an arrest with \\"30 to 50 people surrounding them at any time;\\" he also stated that his officers feel \\"confused and unsupported\\" in the wake of the charges. The president of the police union said his members are \\"afraid of going to jail for doing their jobs properly.\\" According to media reports, looting at 27 drugstores and two methadone clinics resulted in an increase in black market access to opiates.https://www.baltimoresun.com/health/bal-drugs-stolen-during- unrest-story.html%3foutputType=amp See also * List of incidents of civil unrest in Baltimore * List of incidents of civil unrest in the United States * Ferguson unrest * George Floyd protests * Baltimore Rising References Further reading *Why Baltimore Rebelled.

Johnson is an American criminal defense attorney and professor of law at Georgetown University Law Center. Johnson works in the Criminal Defense and Prisoner Advocacy Clinic and Criminal Justice Clinic, and supervises attorneys in the E. Barrett Prettyman Post-Graduate Fellowship Program. Johnson regularly writes in the area of criminal law and procedure. Family and education Johnson's grandfather, Dr. Reverend Allen Johnson, was a leader in the Civil Rights Movement in Mississippi. In 1967, the Johnson family home in Laurel, Mississippi was bombed by members of the Ku Klux Klan. Johnson and his family were targeted because he was an activist in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Vida Johnson was raised in San Diego, California. Johnson went to college at the University of California at Berkeley. Johnson earned her degree in American History. Johnson went on to law school at New York University School of Law. Johnson went to law school wanting to be a civil rights lawyer, following in the footsteps of her grandfather. After her first year of law school, Johnson worked at the Louisiana Crisis Assistance Center where she worked on class-action lawsuits on behalf of death row inmates at the Mississippi State Penitentiary. After her second summer, she interned at the San Francisco public defender's office. During her final year of law school, she worked in the Juvenile Defense Clinic at NYU Law. After law school, Johnson was an E. Barrett Prettyman fellow at Georgetown Law. As a fellow, she represented indigent adults in the D.C. Superior Court and supervised students in the Criminal Justice Clinic. Legal career Public defender service After her fellowship at Georgetown Law, Johnson began work as a public defender with the trial division of the Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia (PDS), where she worked for eight years. At PDS, Johnson handled serious felony cases. She tried numerous felony cases in D.C. Superior Court representing indigent clients facing charges including homicide, sexual assault, and armed offenses. Johnson eventually became a supervisor of the trial division and served as one of the PDS's two representatives to the D.C. Superior Court Sentencing Guidelines Commission. Georgetown Law In 2009, Johnson began working and teaching in the Juvenile Justice Clinic at Georgetown University Law Center. Johnson now works in the Criminal Justice Clinic (CJC) and Criminal Defense & Prisoner Advocacy Clinic (CDPAC). In her CDPAC and CJC role, she directs Juris Doctor students representing defendants facing misdemeanor charges in D.C. Superior Court. Johnson is also a supervisor for the E. Barrett Prettyman Fellowship and Stuart Stiller Post-Graduate Fellowship Program. The E. Barrett Prettyman and Stuart Stiller Fellowship Program combines instruction in the Law Center's graduate school with representation of indigent clients in the local courts of the District of Columbia. It trains recent law graduates in both the academic and practical aspects of courtroom advocacy. The program aims to improve defense advocacy in the criminal justice system by providing able, devoted counsel under mature supervision for indigent defendants. The fellowships are awarded to three recent law graduates selected to participate in a two-year program leading to the LL.M. degree. In the program, Johnson supervises fellows handling felonies and misdemeanors. Writing and views Johnson writes and teaches in the area of criminal law. In A Plea for Funds: Using Padilla, Lafler, and Frye to Increase Public Defender Resources, writes about Supreme Court case law around ineffective assistance of counsel and on how this line of cases impacts public defender offices. Johnson does indigent criminal defense work because she believes there to be criminalization of the black community that replaced the Jim Crow segregation of her grandfather's time. Johnson appeared on C-SPAN to discuss criminal defense work. Johnson supports the Black Lives Matter movement. Johnson signed \\"Second chances: More harm than good?,\\" a letter to the editor of The Washington Post, along with Professor Abbe Smith and Professor Kristin Henning.https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/second-chances-more-harm-than- good/2016/12/07/e40e3a70-bbcd-11e6-ae79-bec72d34f8c9_story.html The letter criticized the \\"Second-Chance City\\" series and its negative portrayal of the Youth Rehabilitation Act.

The two legal actions differ only in that quantum meruit is used to recover the reasonable value of services rendered, while quantum valebant is used to recover the reasonable value of goods sold and delivered.See 1 Corbin on Contracts (rev. ed.1993) ¬ß 1.18, at p. 53 (footnote omitted). This count is considered a type of assumpsit.See Joseph & Thomas Chitty, 1 A Treatise on the Parties to Actions, and on Pleading, p. 760 (1837); Harn v, Patterson, 58 Okla. 694, 160 P. 924, 926 (1916).

Co..Decisions of the U.S. Comptroller General (July 27, 1976), No. B-182437 In that case, the United States Navy had entered into a contract to buy 160 electronic oscillator units at a specified price. The Navy later decided that it wanted 40 more units. Monitor, the subcontractor, told the Navy's project engineer that it needed substantial price increase for the additional 40 units as well as reimbursement for cost overruns which it was incurring in producing the initial 160 units; otherwise it would have to cease production. No additional formal contract was signed, but the project went ahead and Monitor provided the 200 units. The Navy declined to pay any additional amount, although Monitor insisted that it was induced to incur the additional costs by a representative of the Navy (the project engineer), who appeared to have the authority to commit the Government. The Comptroller General of the United States held that > the courts and our Office have recognized that in appropriate circumstances > payment may be made for services rendered on a quantum meruit basis (the > reasonable value of work or labor), or for goods furnished on a quantum > valebat basis (the reasonable value of goods sold and delivered). According to the ruling, the Navy ratified an agreement for the extra units and cost overrun. Therefore, \\"Monitor's claim may be paid to the extent that the value of the items furnished exceeds any compensation which Monitor may have received from\\" the prime contractor for the work.

From the Potlotek First Nation in Nova Scotia, Battiste is the daughter of Mi'kmaq parents John and Annie Battiste and is one of four children. Battiste was raised in Houlton, Maine, where she attended high school graduating in 1967. From there she went on to the University of Maine graduating from the Farmington campus in 1971 with her teaching certificate and a bachelor of science in both elementary and junior high education. She went on to attend Harvard University graduating in 1974 with a master of education in administration and social policy as well as Stanford University, where in 1984 she graduated with a doctor of education in curriculum and teacher education. Work After graduating from the University of Maine in 1971 Battiste went on to work at the Maine Indian Education Council where she introduced and developed an early childhood education program, Head Start, on three reservations and in multiple off reservation communities. Battiste spent twenty-five years in Cape Breton where she worked alongside James (Sakej) Youngblood Henderson with young Mi'kmaq students helping them become teacher and lawyers, as well as fighting for their admittance into universities. The work Battiste and Henderson did together grew the number of Mi'kmaq teachers from a few to sixty, and the addition of ten lawyers where there had previously been none. Battiste has worked in the field of Indian education for over thirty years with her most well known work being the revitalization of Mi'kmaq language in her home community in Chapel Island, Nova Scotia. She credits her doctoral dissertation as one of the many starting points interest in revitalizing the native language saying that a conversation with her advisor about the multiple writing systems of the Mi'kmaq language inspired her to research the histories of these writing systems. There are three different methods for writing with two still in use the first and most commonly used is the Pacifique system and the second and more controversial method being the Francis-Smith system. According to Battiste the Francis-Smith system of writing comes with more controversy for many reasons but the primary reason being, as she puts it, \\"reflecting the fact that we are now using English as a second language in most of our communities,\\" and \\"it seems to undercut the power of the old language for many.\\" Throughout her many years of work in education Battiste has taught a various schools in Nova Scotia including time spent as the Education Director and Principle on the Chapel Island reserve from 1984 to 1988. Battiste is sometimes called a \\"guru\\" of aboriginal education and serves as the academic director of the University of Saskatchewan's aboriginal education research center.

The most prominent of these awards, Honorary Officer of the Order of Canada in 2019 and in 2008 she was one of 14 recipients of the National Aboriginal Achievement Award, now the Indspire Awards, for her work in aboriginal education in Canada. Her list of honors also includes the 1985 Woman of the Year award from the Sydney, Nova Scotia Professional and Business Women's Society. In the same year she also received the Alumni Achievement award from the University of Maine Farmington. Battiste is the recipient of two Honorary Doctorates one from St. Mary's University in 1987, and the other an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from the University of Maine, Farmington, in 1997. In 1992 she received the 125th Year Queen's Award for Service to the Community as well as the Nova Scotia Social Studies Curriculum Development Award. In 1993 Battiste was honored with a White Eagle Feather at the Eskasoni School Pow Wow in Eskasoni, Nova Scotia, and again in 1995 was honored by the Mi'kmaq Grand Council with an Eagle Feather on Mi'kmaq Treaty Day.

Their son, Yakov Yukhimovich Lizohub, became the family's most famed member.  Notable family members  * Ivan Kindratovych Lyzohub (? - after 1662), colonel of Kaniv and Uman regiments, envoy of Ivan Vyhovsky to the Muscovy, participant of the Battle of Konotop, executed on orders of Yuri Khmelnytsky * Yakiv Kindrotovych Lyzohub (?‚Äì1698), colonel of Kaniv regiment * Yakiv Yukhymovych Lyzohub (1675‚Äì1749) - Quartermaster General, acting hetman, member of the Governing Council of the Hetman Office * Fedir Andriyovych Lyzohub (1862‚Äì1928), a Prime Minister of Ukraine (1918).  Relation to Nikolai Gogol  Nikolai Gogol's grandmother was Tatiana Lizohub, the daughter of the Chernigov landlord Semyon Semyonovich Lizohub. Tatyana Lizohub was a great-granddaughter of Hetman Pyotr Doroshenko and a granddaughter of Hetman Ivan Skoropadsky. She secretly married her teacher Afanasiy Yanovsky. A connection to the Lizohub family allowed Afanasy Yanovsky to pursue military career. Later, he made himself ennobled as a claimant to the descent from hetman Ostap Gogol.

True Jr. (July 1, 1880 ‚Äì September 24, 1946) was a critic of the administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR). His opposition focused on New Deal programs and used anti-Semitic and isolationist themes. He published a newsletter and headed James True Associates, a personally-financed one-man enterprise. Early years James Benjamin True Jr. was born on July 1, 1880, to James Benjamin Sr. and Sarah Crump True. James True Jr. married Florence (Florestine) Bernos in New Orleans in 1905. He worked for the New Orleans Item as a writer and reporter until, exhausted from overwork, he moved with his wife and three children to Long Beach, Mississippi, in 1911. There he supported his family by writing short stories. He deserted his wife and five children at the end of 1918. He worked for the Chicago Tribune from 1917 to 1919. Activist In the early 1930s, following the trials of the Scottsboro case, James True Associates, founded in July 1933, was one of a number of voices that identified Jews with a plan to subvert American society and overthrow the U.S. government using African Americans as \\"the shock troops of the revolution\\". True and his newsletter, Industrial Control Reports, which charged $12 for an annual subscription, came to the attention of the FDR administration after just a few months. In October 1933, General Hugh S. Johnson, head of the National Recovery Administration (NRA), one of the earliest and most critical programs of the New Deal, notified True that he was no longer welcome at his press conferences. He wrote: \\"Your last industrial control report is full of misinformation and sabotage of NRA. I encourage constructive criticism but your statements have been consistently without foundation in fact and in one case distinctly libelous.\\" True replied that he had twenty years of experience reporting and planned to continue attending. True was ejected when he tried to attend Johnson's next conference. In covering the dispute, the Chicago Tribune described Industrial Control Reports as \\"a weekly business gossip letter\\". True failed to win support from the trade reporters committee, which ruled he was no longer eligible to be a member of their group. He apparently originated the use of the term America First as a label for isolationists, later made famous on the eve of World War II by the America First Committee. On Sept 17, 1934, True, identifying himself as president of American First, Inc., called on FDR to dismiss all government officials who \\"opposed to our democratic system of government\\". He said: \\"Obviously following the theories of Karl Marx, your administrators and advisers have based their plans on the Soviet Russian system of regimentation and collectivism\\". He named as suitable candidates for dismissal Interior Secretary Harold Ickes and Labor Secretary Frances Perkins, the U.S. Ambassadors to Germany and Russia, William Dodd and William Bullitt, and more than a dozen others. In November 1938, the Dies Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives identified True as a distributor of anti-Semitic propaganda in the U.S. In testimony before that committee in May 1939, George Deatherage, head of the white supremacist Knights of the White Camellia, reported that True had patented a weapon for street-fighting against Jews, which the New York Times described as \\"a sort of baton about three feet long with knobs and notches in it\\". True lobbied Congress routinely and supported a variety of right-wing figures. On May 31, 1939, when General George Moseley testified before the Dies committee and called on President Roosevelt to remove all communists from government and use the army to put down an imminent Communist revolution in the United States, James True's presence in the audience was noted along with that of Donald Shea of the American Gentile League. As FDR made plans to seek an unprecedented third-term as president in 1940, True, according to later court testimony, wrote that he was receiving increasing requests for information about the president's \\"Jewish ancestry\\", which he thought would frustrate FDR's plans. Sedition trial True was indicted for sedition along with 27 others on July 23, 1942. The charge was conspiring to impair the morale of the armed forces. He was identified as \\"James C. True of Arlington, Va., and Washington, publisher of Industrial Control Reports and organizer of James True Associates\\". Two years later True was among a group of 30 indicted and charged with participation in a Nazi plot to incite mutiny and revolution. When the trial opened in April 1944, True, aged 66, was described as an \\"elderly defendant\\" and after returning to his Arlington, Virginia, home on the trial's seventh day he collapsed. His court-appointed attorney said he was \\"feeble\\" and \\"critical\\" and his wife says he was \\"weak as a rag\\". The trial continued even while he was unable to attend, which his attorney later argued was grounds for a mistrial. Judge Edward C. Eicher severed True from rest of defendants, but the prosecution continued to present testimony that made him out to be part of the conspiracy. In August, True's landlady testified to hearing a True complain of someone's failure to assassinate the president, tell of plans for a revolution in New York, and give someone a weapon he said could \\"kill six Jews\\". The trial ended in a mistrial after eight months when Judge Eicher died of a heart attack in November 1944. As the government argued for a new trial over defense objections, True died and was buried in an unmarked grave in Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington, DC, on September 28, 1946.

He is the archenemy of Scott Lang (the second superhero to be called Ant-Man), and the cousin of Crossfire. The character was portrayed in live-action by actor Corey Stoll in Marvel Studios' 2015 film Ant-Man as the Marvel Cinematic Universe's iteration of Yellowjacket. This concept would later be integrated into the comics. Publication history Created by John Byrne and David Micheline, Darren Cross debuted in Marvel Premiere #47 (April 1979). The character made his first appearance as Yellowjacket in The Astonishing Ant-Man #12 (September 2016), which was written by Nick Spencer and illustrated by Brent Shoonover. Fictional character biography Darren Cross is a millionaire and the founder of a successful corporation, which rivals its top competitors. Cross was diagnosed with a heart condition due to overwork, and had to use an experimental nucleorganic pacemaker in order to save his life. The pacemaker was a success but enhanced Cross's circulatory system, mutating his body and giving him superhuman abilities. With a side effect that overuse causes the burning out of his heart, Cross went through various heart transplants, which led him to capture surgeon Dr. Erica Sondheim to replace his heart and to abduct \\"donors\\" from the slums.Marvel Premiere #47. Marvel Comics. This attracted the attention of the second Ant-Man looking for Sondheim in order to save his own daughter's life. The resulting battle with Ant-Man burned out Cross's heart, as Sondheim had reimplanted his old, worn-out heart prior to Ant-Man crashing the surgery.Marvel Premiere #48. Marvel Comics. After his death, the family company created by Darren had been controlled by his cousin William Cross,Hawkeye #1-4. Marvel Comics. and later his son Augustine Cross.Iron Man #145. Marvel Comics. Darren's body is later revealed to have been kept in a cryonic state as Augustine was obsessed with bringing Darren back to life and eventually forces Dr. Sondheim to help.Ant-Man Vol. 2 #3.

While infiltrating Cross's company to rescue Cassie, Ant-Man came across his restored nemesis.Ant-Man Vol. 2 #4. Marvel Comics. Darren engaged in combat against Ant-Man while Ant-Man buys time for Sondheim to transplant another heart to Cassie. Darren is ultimately forced to flee with his son when the Pym Particles now in his body caused him to shrink down.Ant-Man Vol. 2 #5. Marvel Comics. As part of the \\"All-New, All- Different Marvel,\\" Darren Cross was later approached by Power Broker to demonstrate his latest \\"Hench\\" App by hiring Whirlwind to kill Ant-Man. However, Cross was unwilling to give Power Broker the 1.2 billion dollars demanded for investment in the Hench app, causing Power Broker to cancel the demo and cancel Whirlwind's assassination on Ant-Man.Astonishing Ant-Man #1. Marvel Comics. Cross later represented his own company when he attended a meeting at the Universal Bank with Tiberius Stone of Alchemax, Wilson Fisk of Fisk Industries, Sebastian Shaw of Shaw Industries, Zeke Stane of Stane International, Frr'dox of Shi'ar Solutions Consolidated, and Wilhelmina Kensington of Kilgore Arms where they discussed Dario Agger's and Roxxon Energy Corporation's plans to exploit the Ten Realms of Asgard. Cross also saw the arrival of Exterminatrix of the Midas Foundation who knocked out Dario and declared herself a new member of their assembly.Mighty Thor Vol. 2 #8. Marvel Comics.

Powers and abilities Darren Cross possesses a keen scientific mind and is a successful businessman. The experimental nucleorganic pacemaker that saved Cross from his heart condition also granted him superhuman abilities such as enhanced physical attributes, increased sensory perception, and a regenerative healing factor. After acquiring Cassie Lang's Pym Particle-equipped heart during a heart transplant, Cross gained near uncontrollable size-shifting abilities; he is at risk of growing when angered and shrinking when calm. Egghead later created the Yellowjacket suit for Cross to help him control his Pym Particle quantum powers.

Film Corey Stoll as Darren Cross / Yellowjacket in Ant-Man (2015). Corey Stoll portrays Darren Cross / Yellowjacket in the 2015 Marvel Cinematic Universe film Ant-Man. Stoll wore a motion capture suit while performing as Yellowjacket, a decision that was made early on after the production team learned that creating and filming with a real Yellowjacket costume would be impractical. This depiction of Darren Cross is depicted as Hank Pym's former prot√©g√© who becomes obsessed with Pym's particle shrinking technology. However, Pym refuses to divulge his secrets out of fear of warfare, so Cross forces his mentor out of his company, Pym Technologies, takes over as the company's new CEO and begins plans to convert it into Cross Technologies. Despite possessing initially imperfect shrinking technology that, as a result, slowly altered his brain chemistry to the point of making him insane, Cross manages to duplicate Pym's Ant-Man suit designs and create his own weaponized \\"Yellowjacket\\" suit. He sought to sell the Yellowjacket prototype to HYDRA and the Ten Rings terrorist organization, prompting Pym to recruit Scott Lang to become the new Ant-Man, so the two of them and Pym's daughter Hope van Dyne could intervene. While Cross anticipates their plan and nearly captures them, they succeed in destroying Pym Technologies and Darren's resources. With his plans ruined, a livid Cross dons the Yellowjacket suit himself to fight Ant-Man until the latter shrinks to a size small enough to disrupt the Yellowjacket's internal mainframe, causing Cross to shrink uncontrollably and disappear.

Verity! has a female-centered format and is a feminist podcast. It was nominated for the \\"Best Fancast\\" at the Hugo Awards in 2014 and 2018. The Verity! contributors are all Doctor Who fans and live in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia. The show has been described as \\"intelligently fannish\\" and referenced as a recommended podcast.  History  Verity! first aired January 2013. Deborah Stanish, the moderator of the podcast, met most of the other participants at conventions or other Doctor Who events or by working with them on non-fiction, Doctor Who-related books. Stanish wanted to hear the female and minority voices of Doctor Who fans and decided to start a podcast where several women could lend their view to the show and issues surrounding it. The format of having only women on the podcast made it stand out among the many other Doctor Who-related podcasts. The podcast's name is a homage to Verity Lambert, the first producer of Doctor Who.  Content  Verity! shows consist of a discussion of various topics touching on and about Doctor Who among the cast members. There is a \\"proper\\" episode every other week that is about an hour long and is based on a theme that the podcasters follow all year. The other episodes are shorter, about twenty to forty minutes and can be on any topic the women choose. Erika Ensign and Stanish participate in most episodes: Stanish is the moderator and Ensign does the technical work. The other four cast members rotate, except for large celebratory episodes where all six come together for the show. Each contributor to Verity! lives in a different part of the world, so they record in their own locations and are connected via a Skype call. Verity! is not scripted, except for some contributors, like Ensign and Stanish, who use occasional notes in order to stay on topic. Overall, the show is not heavily edited and is meant to sound like a natural conversational flow.

In one of the company's early years, they shipped an order of 700,000 angle grinders to Black & Decker. Later, Black & Decker would stop ordering from Positec to focus on manufacturing its own tools. After this, Gao began to steer the company toward becoming an independent manufacturer and seller of branded products. In 2004, the company released the WORX line of lawn and garden equipment. Gao hired Paolo Andriolo, a designer based in Vicenza, Italy, to design \\"ergonomic\\" products for Positec. The flagship product was an electronic lawn trimmer called the WORX GT. Around the time of the WORX release, Don Gao met Tom Duncan, a former executive at the Vermont American Tool Company (a joint venture between the Emerson Electric Company and the Robert Bosch Tool Group). After quitting his job at Vermont American, Duncan acquired the rights to the \\"Rockwell\\" brand which hadn't been used for power tools since 1981. Gao and Duncan partnered up, with Duncan becoming the head of Positec's North American division in Charlotte, North Carolina in 2005. Positec initially struggled to find buyers for their products. Retailers liked the products Positec produced, but they wanted to use their own branding (instead of WORX or Rockwell). In order to bypass this restriction, Duncan (along with Vice President of Direct Response, Rhonda Tate) decided to engage in a direct response marketing campaign. The company ran its first infomercial for the WORX GT in March 2007. By December 2007, the company had sold 313,000 units. The company had produced 10 long-form infomercials for the Rockwell Tools and WORX brands by 2012. Positec officially released the Rockwell Tools line in 2007. Both Rockwell Tools and WORX products first appeared in a retailer in October 2009 at Lowe's. By 2012, their products could be found in other major retailers like The Home Depot, Walmart, and Costco. In order to accommodate increased sales, Positec USA moved its distribution center from Long Beach, California to Huntersville, North Carolina in 2012. By 2014, the company employed 4,000 people in 12 subsidiaries throughout the world. It also maintained facilities in numerous nations, including the United States, China, Spain, Brazil, Australia, and Canada. Products Kasey Kahne at Rockingham Speedway driving the #4 Truck sponsored by Positec brand Rockwell Tools. Positec produces, distributes, and sells products under two major brand names: WORX and Rockwell Tools. WORX is a line of lawn and garden equipment that includes products like lawn trimmers, lawn mowers, chainsaws, leaf blowers, yard carts, and accessories. Rockwell Tools is a line of power tools and hand tools that consists of products like circular saws, drills, angle grinders, and specialty tools like the oscillating SoniCrafter and the Jawhorse clamping device. Recognition and awards In 2010, retailer Lowe's honored Positec with the Supplier of the Year Award. Lowe's also named Positec the \\"Innovator of the Year\\" among their 2,500 other suppliers. The company's WORX GT lawn trimmer also received an award from the U.S. Electronic Retailing Association in 2010. In 2011, Positec received awards from DIY Week for Product of the Year in the power tool and garden tools categories. In 2013, the World Wildlife Fund presented Positec with the Platinum Low Carbon Award for its sustainable manufacturing facilities in China.

It was discovered on a 1996 expedition commemorating the work of the early German-Australian botanist, Ferdinand von Mueller. It is a shrub with grey foliage and contrasting green heads of flowers in spring. Description Melaleuca triumphalis grows to a height of and has grey, rather papery bark and hairy young stems. Its leaves are arranged alternately, narrow elliptic in shape, long, wide, covered with fine hairs and have 3 to 5 longitudinal veins. The flowers are arranged in heads or short spikes up to in diameter and contain 10 to 20 groups of flowers in threes. The flowers appear in September and are green, fading to yellow. The petals are long and fall off as the flower matures. The stamens are arranged in bundles of five around the flower, with 7 to 12 stamens in each bundle. The base of the flower is hairy and long. The woody capsules are long. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca triumphalis was first described in 1998 by Lyndley Craven in Muelleria from a specimen collected in the Judbarra / Gregory National Park on the 1996 expedition to commemorate the centenary of the death of Ferdinand von Mueller. The specific epithet (triumphalis) is a reference to the triumphal results of Mueller on the Gregory expedition and to the collection of a specimen of this species on the centenary expedition. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca triumphalis occurs in the Victoria River district in springs at the base of waterfalls and at the top of scree slopes. Conservation A search for individuals of this species in the Judbarra / Gregory National Park found 37 populations however it is possible that M. triumphalis also occurs in other places with similar ecological niches such as the Keep River National Park.

Sir Harry Smith's Medal for Gallantry is an unofficial military decoration for bravery, awarded for actions following the siege of Fort Cox in December 1850, at the beginning of the 8th Cape Frontier War. The medal was privately instituted in 1851 by Major General Sir Henry George Wakelyn Smith Bt GCB, at the time the Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Cape of Good Hope.Online Medals - Medal Encyclopaedia - Sir Harry Smith‚Äôs Medal For Gallantry (Access date 27 April 2015)National Army Museum - Sir Harry Smith Medal for Gallantry 1851, awarded to Paul Arendt (Access date 27 April 2015) The 8th Cape Frontier War Fort Cox was situated inland from King William's Town. During the unrest in the Eastern Cape in December 1850, which led to the outbreak of the 8th Cape Frontier War, the longest, costliest and bloodiest of the frontier wars, Cape of Good Hope Governor Sir Harry Smith travelled to the Fort to meet with prominent Xhosa chiefs. Smith's reputation for humiliating treatment of the various chiefs had already fostered a deep, smouldering anger amongst the Xhosa peoples, even though he still believed that they regarded him as their Inkhosi Inkhulu or Supreme Chief.The South African Military History Society - Military History Journal Vol 3 No 1, June 1974 - Sir Harry Smith, By Andrew L. Harington (Access date 27 April 2015)The South African Military History Society - Military History Journal Vol 15 No 4, December 2011 - Harry Smith, Henry Somerset and the Siege of Fort Cox, By David Saks (Access date 27 April 2015) Mgolombane Sandile One of the chiefs, Mgolombane Sandile, paramount chief of the Rharhabe clan, refused to attend the meeting outside the fort on 19 December and was therefore declared as deposed and a fugitive by Smith, who ordered the gathering of some 3,000 Ngqika and their chiefs to capture Sandile and his rebels to demonstrate their own loyalty to the Crown and avoid the fate of those who defied it. This was the last straw and Fort Cox then came under siege from warriors of the Xhosa tribes, led by Chief Sandile. Fort Cox was not provisioned to withstand a long siege, had no artillery and could only be supplied with water by hazardous expeditions to and from the Keiskamma River far below. Several attempts to relieve the Fort were unsuccessful and Smith, concerned that his being trapped in Fort Cox would affect the Colony's morale and cause the defection of loyal Xhosa tribes, decided to fight his way out. On 31 December 1850, escorted by about 250 men of the Cape Mounted Riflemen, which consisted of Khoisan and Coloured men under white officers, Smith succeeded to get through the Xhosa lines and safely reached King William's Town, after evading an attempt to stop him at Debe Nek. Fort Cox was finally relieved on 31 January 1851. Institution Impressed by the showing of the Cape Mounted Riflemen under his command, Smith created Sir Harry Smith's Medal for Gallantry in recognition of their conduct. In later years, when asked who made the best soldiers, Smith put the men of southern France during the Battle of Waterloo in a class of their own, followed by the Cape's Hottentots who had, in his opinion, a truly remarkable natural aptitude for soldiering. Although the British government initially disapproved of Sir Harry's institution of the medal, it subsequently paid for it and thereby gave it recognition, but not official status. Sir Harry Smith's Medal for Gallantry is regarded by some as the first South African military medal. As an unofficial British medal for valour, it predates the institution of the Victoria Cross (1856) as well as the oldest British award for gallantry, the Distinguished Conduct Medal (1854).South African Medal Website - Unofficial Military Awards (Access date 27 April 2015)The Origins of Gallantry Awards - Sir Harry Smith's Medal for Gallantry (Access date 27 April 2015) Description The medal is a disk, 34 millimetres in diameter and struck in silver. The plain curved bar suspender is attached to the medal through a hole in the top of a claw mount, which is attached to the medal by a pin through the upper edge of the medal. ;Obverse The obverse depicts a lion beneath a crown of laurel leaves, with the year \\"1851\\" in the exergue. ;Reverse The reverse is plain and is inscribed \\"PRESENTED BY\\" around the upper perimeter, \\"HIS EXCELLENCY\\", \\"SIR H.G.

While the ribbon has been described as being that of the British Sutlej Medal, the dimensions and colour of the bands appear to be different. Recipients Around 31 of the medals were awarded to officers and men of the Cape Mounted Riflemen for gallantry in action. Of these, 23 are known and 20 are known to have been privately engraved in various styles with the names of the recipients.

Status While privately instituted military decorations and medals do not enjoy official status as a result of not having been formally instituted or sanctioned by the fount of honour at the time, and while none of them were therefore allowed to be worn with military uniform, some have become well- known and have acquired recognition in South Africa's military medal history.

Early years  Yoneda was born Rose Elaine Buchman in Connecticut to Russian Jewish immigrants Nathan and Mollie Buchman. Her parents, child laborers in a Ukraine match factory, had from an early age been active in the Jewish Workers Alliance. The two fled Czarist Russian in 1902, and Yoneda was born shortly after their arrival in the United States in 1905. The family settled in Brooklyn, New York. In 1920 Yoneda's family moved to Lemon Grove, California, and then San Diego where her father ran a dry goods store and Elaine attended San Diego High School. By 1924 the family was living in Los Angeles, where Yoneda helped out in the family clothing store and completed secretarial training. She attended a meeting of the Young Workers League at the encouragement of her parents, where she met Edward Francis Russell, Jr. They married in 1925 and Yoneda gave birth to their daughter Joyce in 1927.  Politicization  In 1930 Yoneda became active in the labor movement after observing a demonstration in which the Los Angeles Red Squad assaulted an elderly woman. Yoneda joined the International Labor Defense (ILD) and by 1931 she was working for the ILD office as a clerical worker. As part of her duties, Yoneda bailed out Japanese American demonstrator Karl \\"Hama\\" Yoneda, who had been beaten and arrested by the Los Angeles Police Department. Shortly thereafter, Yoneda separated from Edward Russell and in 1935 she and Karl Yoneda were married in Seattle, Washington; anti-miscegenation laws in California made it illegal for them to marry in California. After relocating to San Francisco with Karl sometime in the early 1930s, Yoneda continued her activities in the civil rights, labor, and union movements, and also joined the Communist Party and worked for the ILD as a district secretary. Yoneda's work with the ILD included supporting striking agricultural workers and visiting prisoners such as Tom Mooney and others who had been arrested under the Criminal Syndicalism laws. Yoneda herself was arrested in Dolores Park, San Francisco, for participating in a rally against the Criminal Syndicalism laws in March 1935. Yoneda became known as the ‚ÄúRed Angel‚Äù for her work in defending union members and labor demonstrators in the San Francisco waterfront and General Strike of 1934. She was the only woman on the steering committee of the 1934 General Strike. Yoneda participated in many high-profile labor and civil rights activities such as the Salinas Lettuce Strike, National Scottsboro Week and Spanish Civil War relief. She ran for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1939 on a platform of free day care, low cost housing, and civil rights. She was defeated.  Internment  After the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941, Yoneda's husband and the couple's two-year- old son, Tommy, were sent to the internment camp in Manzanar, California. Yoneda entrusted her daughter Joyce into the care of her parents and remained with Karl and Tommy in the camp. After Karl began volunteering intelligence for the United States, she was allowed to move back to San Francisco with her son.  Later years and death  After the war the family purchased a chicken ranch near Petaluma, California. Yoneda kept up her activities in labor and civil rights movements, acting as chair for the Sonoma chapter of the Civil Rights Congress. The farm was sold in 1960 and the family returned to San Francisco. She remained involved with a variety of labor organizations, including the International Longshore and Warehouse Union's Women's Auxiliary and the Office Workers Union, and also participated in peace movements and various civil rights cases, including the Wilmington Ten. The Yoneda family made annual trips to Manzanar and were active with the Japanese American Citizens League in campaigning for redress and reparations for Japanese Americans incarcerated during World War II. Yoneda attended a longshoremen's rally supporting the Rev. Jesse Jackson's presidential campaign the day before she died of a heart attack on May 29, 1988.

The brand offers power tools and hand tools that are most often used in professional and private construction, automotive repair, and woodworking. Its products are sold at a variety of retailers including Lowe's, Costco, and The Home Depot. History Rockwell SoniCrafter The Positec Tool Corporation was founded in Suzhou, China, in 1994 by Don Gao. It primarily sold OEM tools to established brands like Black & Decker. In the early 2000s, Gao decided to branch out by manufacturing tools and lawn care accessories under his own brand name. Meanwhile, Tom Duncan, the current CEO of the Positec Tool Corporation in North America, was the vice president of a Robert Bosch GmbH-owned company called Vermont American. He quit that job in 2003 to pursue the manufacture of a line of power tools. He purchased the rights to the brand name \\"Rockwell\\" which hadn't been in use for power tools since 1981. Gao and Duncan met in 2004, with Gao looking to launch the \\"WORX\\" brand of lawn care accessories and Duncan looking to manufacture the Rockwell Tools brand. They decided to partner up, and Duncan became the head of the North American division of Positec in 2005. Both the Rockwell Tools and the WORX brands were originally sold directly to consumers via infomercials. Products branded with Rockwell Tools first appeared in the retailer Lowe's, in October 2009. By 2012, the main North American distribution center had moved to Huntersville, North Carolina, from Long Beach, California, to facilitate the increased sales. Rockwell Tools could also be found in Costco and The Home Depot (among other retailers) in 2012. Kasey Kahne driving the #4 truck sponsored by Rockwell Tools at Rockingham Speedway. In 2012, the Rockwell brand was designated the \\"Official Power Tool\\" of Rockingham Speedway in Rockingham, North Carolina. They also served as the sponsor for Kasey Kahne's vehicle in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series race in Rockingham that year. In 2013, Rockwell Tools was a part of an integrated ad campaign that was featured on both the History Channel and its reality TV series Counting Cars. The campaign's slogan was \\"Rock Your Garage\\", which was also the title of a sweepstakes associated with the campaign. Products The Rockwell Tools brand features power tools (both corded and cordless) and hand tools.

Worden was caught selling details on the 401 process, a process designed to increase the speed and quality of film during development, during a sting operation conducted by Kodak after two of their competitors, Konica and Agfa-Gevaert, told Kodak that he had approached them selling trade secrets. After the sting operation, Worden was sentenced to 15 months in prison and a fine of $30,000 for interstate transportation of stolen property.  Overview  Harold Worden was a former employee of Kodak and he worked for 28 years at the company. During his time at Kodak, Worden had worked as a project manager in the Rochester-based Kodak film manufacturing plant that Kodak tasked to develop the 401 process, a process designed to enhance both the speed and quality of film manufacturing. Kodak made the information involved in the process secret and tried to protect against it leaving the company by compartmentalizing the information so that no one employee had all the information and so that it was restricted on a need-to-know basis. Worden was one of the few employees that had access to all of the information. In 1992, Worden retired from Kodak and set up a consulting firm located in Santee, South Carolina. After Worden retired, he began to buy confidential data from another former Kodak employee, Kurt Strobl, at Kodak and from 63 other former Kodak colleagues. He also hired many former Kodak employees to work at his firm. From these actions, Worden was able to obtain a book containing every secret Kodak manufacturing formula with details of every chemical makeup of film base and coating, a book containing specifications for a $500 million film sensitizing facility, a collection of secret trouble- shooting procedures for the manufacturing of acetate, and a collection of techniques for inspecting and testing finished film base. In 1994, Kodak became aware of Worden's activities after executives at Konica and Agfa- Gevaert told Kodak and the FBI that Worden had approached them trying to sell trade secrets. In response to this, Kodak began to investigate him. They then set up a sting operation in which a Kodak executive and a security consultant, both of which were former FBI agents, set up a meeting posing as two employees of a phony Chinese company where Worden offered to show them how to make to high quality acetate, using the 401 process, for a fee between $125,000 and $500,000. The FBI executed a search warrant, seizing about 40,000 documents from Worden's home in Santee before taking the case to the U.S. Attorney's Office. Worden was arrested for interstate transportation of stolen goods by the FBI and sentenced on November 13, 1997, with a 15-month prison sentence and a fine of $30,000. In addition to the criminal case, Kodak also sued Worden in order to prevent Worden or Strobel from using any other information that he had stolen. As a part of his plea deal, Worden agreed to help Kodak determine who may have received Kodak proprietary information.  Significant actions by Worden  Worden did many things which make this an example of an industrial espionage case. While Worden was still an employee at Kodak, he was in charge of recommending what technologies should be patented or assigned trade secret. He advised Kodak not to patent major elements of the 401 process because it would facilitate reverse engineering by competitors. Before his retirement, he procured documents and proprietary information detailing major components of Kodak technology. In addition to acquiring the information about Kodak technology, Worden was the project manager at the Rochester-based Kodak plant which developed and implemented the 401 process. This gave him position and access which he used to gain the information and know how it could be implemented. He also did not give back confidential information that he took from the company when he left. These factors became very important when Worden left Kodak to set up his own consulting firm. Once Worden left Kodak, he set up his own consulting firm, Worden Enterprise Inc., in Santee, South Carolina, and recruited Kurt Strobel, another former Kodak employee, to work with him at his consulting firm. Worden also recruited more than 60 Kodak retirees to sell him trade secrets or to consult Kodak competitors. Worden used this consulting firm to broker stolen documents and his knowledge of Kodak technology to competitors. This consulting by Worden constituted a breach in professional ethics. However, the current and retired employees did not physically give stolen technology or documents to Kodak competitors. Instead, they used Kodak's problem solving techniques to help competitors to develop Kodak technology which did not violate the current laws protecting trade secrets. After Kodak learned about Worden's actions, the sting operation conducted by Kodak shows how Worden sold trade secrets. In 1995, a Kodak executive and a security consultant posed as employees of a phony Chinese company trying to break into the modern film manufacturing market and met with Worden in an Atlanta hotel room. During the meeting, Worden said that he would not sell patented technology, but once the operatives said they had $250 million to send on a new factory, Worden offered to show how to make the high quality acetate, crucial for manufacturing film. Worden offered his services and expertise for a fee between $125,000 and $500,000. The sting operation shows that Worden's willingness to sell Kodak technology noting that secrets are not always patented.  Post-case actions  Kodak had security procedures in place to prevent one position from having too much information. They did this by compartmentalizing information and restricting information on a need-to- know basis. Unfortunately, Worden was in a position that allowed him to acquire all the information he would later to sell to Kodak competitors. Kodak also required all employees to sign nondisclosure agreements, but due to a lapse in Kodak's security program, employees did not fully understand their duty to protect trade secrets which was required by their nondisclosure agreements. Because of this, some of them became pawns in Worden's scheme. In response to these lapses in security, many companies have taken various measure in order to prevent the loss of trade secrets. One of these is a trend of hiring former CIA, FBI, Secret Service, and military intelligence experts as security chiefs as well as creating more operational security measure such as shredding more documents to creating better accountability measures for trade secrets. Eastman Kodak sued the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Corp. in 1997, accusing 3M of using trade secrets pilfered by Worden. 3M's division in Italy was at the time the largest maker of private-label film, which Kodak said came to have better quality as a result of 3M having Kodak's proprietary information. Kodak listed seven sales Worden made to 3M Italia totaling $72,462, and accused 3M of providing Worden \\"with substantial assistance in his wrongdoing by providing a ready, no-questions-asked\\" market for stolen Kodak intellectual property. Since the case, the United States Congress passed the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 (EEA). EEA was the culmination of a Congressional mandate, coupled with a joint effort on the part of the FBI and industry, to provide law enforcement with a tool to deal effectively with trade secret theft and industrial espionage. This has allowed the FBI to identify perpetrators of industrial espionage, identify the economic target of spying and criminal activities, and identify the methods of used to steal and illicit U.S. trade secrets. Also through this law, the FBI, the United States Department of Defense and businesses can better collaborate to prevent to loss of trade secrets to both companies in the United States and abroad.  Impact of case  This case has various impacts on business security and industrial espionage. The most important result of this case is the development and implementation of EEA which has allowed for the better prosecution of those who sell trade secrets. Through this law, various other cases of industrial espionage have been stopped and prosecuted. Related to the effectiveness of laws, this case demonstrates the ambiguity of the laws of the day pertaining to industrial espionage. The difference between how Worden and other members of his consulting firm approached helping Kodak's competitors shows how slightly different actions can result in different legal outcomes. It also demonstrates that the loss of trade secrets occurs from dishonesty and theft. This has forced corporations to significantly examine their security procedures. Lastly it has led to the development of competitive intelligence departments in major businesses. Competitive intelligence parts of companies were able to develop in order to gain an advantage over other companies through completely legal measures.

Together with the planned Agua Negra Deep Experiment Site (ANDES) at the Agua Negra Pass, it is one of just two underground particle physics laboratories being considered in the Southern Hemisphere and shall conduct research into dark matter. The project is a collaboration between six international partners. It will be led by the University of Melbourne with the Swinburne University of Technology, the University of Adelaide, the Australian National University, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) and the Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics. It is expected that the project will collaborate closely with the Gran Sasso Laboratory in Italy. Construction commenced in 2019. General information The project's Southern Hemisphere location has bearing on the possible differential detection of the putative WIMP-wind. Northern Hemisphere instruments are showing hints of a June \\"bump\\" of possible dark matter hits, which is expected given the galaxy's rotation, but it is hard to be sure that it is not a false signal due to some subtle seasonal environmental effect. A Southern Hemisphere location, with opposite seasons, would be valuable confirmation. Secondly, the sundry particles (apparently from the constellation Cygnus) would have travelled through the Earth itself before reaching SUPL's instruments. Finally, its Southern Hemisphere location also makes it potentially very sensitive to daily variation effects which would be a smoking-gun for self-interacting dark matter or dark matter with a significant stopping rate. Inasmuch as Neutrino experiments do not benefit in the same way from a Southern Hemisphere location, and IceCube is already extant, it is unlikely that any neutrino detectors will be housed at SUPL.  Funding  The first phase of the project received $1.75 million funding in the 2015 Australian federal budget. With matching funding from Victoria, construction started 2016 and was expected to be complete in 2017. However, a series of corporate mergers in 2015 and 2016 disrupted plans. The project was stalled when the new owners dismissed most of the labour force and shut down the Stawell gold mine to a \\"care and maintenance\\" state in December 2016. In December 2017, yet another new owner announced their intention to reopen the mine and were supportive of the underground laboratory, allowing hope that construction would restart. In 2019, the still-incomplete project resumed. The 2019 Australian federal budget included $5 million for SUPL, and in July 2019 a memorandum of understanding between Stawell Gold Mines Pty Ltd, the Northern Grampians Shire Council, and the University of Melbourne was signed to build and operate the laboratory. So although it has been significantly delayed, the project is not moribund.  Construction  SUPL is planned to be located at a depth of , providing approximately 2900 metre water equivalent shielding against background cosmic rays. As a decline (ramp) mine, cars and trucks can be driven to the laboratory site. The laboratory will consist of a bespoke cavity of approximately 10 metres high and 10 metres wide () excavated into the rock from an existing part of the mine. The laboratory will be divided into of clean room space for experiments, and of \\"dirty\\" loading area. A side tunnel 5 m wide and 20 m long () will house physical plant and personnel facilities. SABRE The first experiment planned for SUPL is SABRE Page 4 gives the latitude of the laboratory as 37¬∞03‚Ä≤S = 37.05¬∞S, but it is not clear if this is accurate for the laboratory proper, or is an approximation based on the latitude of the town of Stawell.

This classification system was developed in 2004 by University of Miami dermatology professor Leslie Baumann, to subdivide research participants into specific phenotypes. She assigns binary values to four characteristics, so defining sixteen \\"skin personalities\\", or \\"skin types\\". These have been used in genetic research aimed at identifying the genes that contribute to skin characteristics such as dryness, oiliness, aging, pigmentation and sensitivity. The a survey-based typing system combines these individual skin attributes into 16 personalities that allow researchers to improve their ability to identify various skin phenotypes and use that knowledge for patient selection for clinical research trials and to recommend proper skincare ingredients and products. The classification system has been adopted by estheticians, dermatologists, consumers and retailers to match cosmeceutical ingredients and skin care products to specific skin types. The type assigned is determined by a self-completed questionnaire, marketed as the \\"Baumann Skin Type Indicator\\" (BSTI). Parameters The typing system identifies four key skin attributes (dry/oily, sensitive/resistant, pigmented/non-pigmented and wrinkle-prone/tight), represented as D/O, S/R, P/N, and W/T. Combining these results in 16 possible types. For example, one type is ORPW (oily, resistant, pigmented, wrinkle-prone) while another is DSPT (dry, sensitive, pigmented, tight). More than just combinations of skin attributes, each type experiences different dermatologic problems, which indicate preventative measures and treatment options. BingoCard Dry vs oily One factor that determines whether skin is dry or oily is the amount of sebum produced by the skin. Sebum creates a fat-based film on the skin, which may also have an effect on skin hydration. The state of the skin‚Äôs stratum corneum plays a role in determining whether one is dry or oily as well, since this barrier layer also helps hold moisture in the skin. Dry skin is often characterized by rough texture, dull color and tightness, especially after cleansing. Oily skin is characterized by increased sebum production, which often leads to acne. The level of sebaceous gland production of sebum, which contains wax esters, triglycerides, and squalene, may also contribute to dry skin and skin protection. Although diet, stress and hormones play a role in sebum production, there is a significant genetic link. Sensitive vs resistant The presence of inflammation is the major determining factor for sensitive or resistant skin. An impaired stratum corneum layer can lead to sensitive skin because this layer of the skin serves as a barrier to keep allergens and irritants out. Sensitive skin often reacts to skincare products with redness, stinging, burning or acne, while resistant skin rarely experiences negative side effects. The strong stratum corneum associated with resistant skin can make the skin resistant to the beneficial effects of skincare ingredients due to less absorption. There are 4 unique subtypes of sensitive skin, and they are all different, all sensitive subtypes have inflammation in common. *Acne subtype: Develops acne, whiteheads or blackheads *Rosacea subtype: Experiences recurring flushing, redness and a hot sensation *Stinging subtype: Develops stinging or burning of the skin *Allergic subtype: Develops redness, itching and flaking of the skin Pigmented vs non- pigmented This skin attribute is measured by the skin‚Äôs tendency to develop unwanted pigment. This can be sun-induced, as in melasma, solar lentigos and freckles, or due to injury in the form of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH). Most pigment changes can be prevented and corrected through the use of proper skincare ingredients. Wrinkle-prone vs tight Age, ethnicity and lifestyle habits influence whether skin is wrinkle-prone or tight. There is still a genetic component to this parameter, but external factors that contribute to an aged appearance are controllable. Sun exposure is the primary cause of skin aging, destroying skin proteins like collagen and elastin. Combinations of skin types Each parameter is associated with particular skin conditions and challenges, and the specific combinations also experience particular tendencies. For example, DRPW types often have a history of sun exposure manifested by wrinkles and solar lentigos; DSNT, DSPT, DSPW and DSNW are more prone to eczema; OSNT and OSPT types are more likely to suffer from acne; and OSNW and DSNW types more commonly experience rosacea. The \\"Baumann Skin Type Indicator\\" (BSTI) questionnaire is the definitive method to determine the type. It is recommended that the BSTI be repeated annually, since the type can change with age, pregnancy, menopause, climate conditions, diet and lifestyle.

It is approximately long and flows through Dickson City. The watershed of the creek's main stem has an area of . Culm was historically discharged into the creek at the Johnson Colliery. Requests have been made in the 20th and 21st centuries for permission to discharge sewage and stormwater into the creek. Course Price Creek begins on Bell Mountain in Dickson City. It flows southwest for a short distance before turning south-southeast for a few tenths of a mile and crossing a highway. The creek then turns south-southwest for a few tenths of a mile before turning south-southeast for several tenths of a mile. It then turns south-southwest again before turning south and receiving the Pancoast Creek, its only named tributary, from the right. A short distance further downstream, it reaches its confluence with the Lackawanna River. Price Creek joins the Lackawanna River on its right bank. Hydrology In the early 1900s, Price Creek was a clear stream until it arrived at the Johnson Colliery, where mine water and waste water was drained into it. From this point downstream to its mouth, the creek's streambed was full of a type of anthracite known as culm. The tributary Pancoast Creek is unaffected by culm, but it was affected by streams of surface water and sewage. A mid-20th-century report estimated the volume of surface seepage into mine workings at Price Creek was 4.22 gallons per minute per inch of rainfall. The rate of streambed seepage in the area was estimated to be 3.71 gallons per minute per inch of rainfall. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Price Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is between above sea level. A total of of the watershed of the main stem of Price Creek is in coal measures. An estimated of the creek is on coal measures. A 100-year floodplain is also present near the creek. The creek crosses a spur of U.S. Route 6. Watershed The watershed of Price Creek has an area of , not counting the watershed of the tributary Pancoast Creek. The mouth of Price Creek is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Olyphant. However, its source is in the quadrangle of Scranton. Price Creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery for its entire length. History Price Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on January 1, 1990. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1202413. The creek was added due to its presence in Patton's Philadelphia and Suburbs Street and Road Map, which was published in 1984. In the early 1900s, the borough of Dickson City was divided into three drainage districts. Price Creek flowed through the first district. During this time period, the borough requested permission to discharge sewage into the creek. More recently, Lackawanna County requested a permit to discharge stormwater into the creek.

AMAT uses hit time, miss penalty, and miss rate to measure memory performance. It accounts for the fact that hits and misses affect memory system performance differently. In addition, AMAT can be extended recursively to multiple layers of the memory hierarchy. It focuses on how locality and cache misses affect overall performance and allows for a quick analysis of different cache design techniques. A tacit assumption of AMAT is that a data access is either a hit or a miss, meaning the memory only supports sequential accesses and cannot have multiple accesses occurring simultaneously. Recently AMAT has been extended to consider concurrent data access. A model, called Concurrent-AMAT (C-AMAT), is introduced for more accurate analysis of current memory systems. More information on C-AMAT can be found in the external links section. AMAT's three parameters hit time (or hit latency), miss rate, and miss penalty provide a quick analysis of memory systems. Hit latency (H) is the time to hit in the cache. Miss rate (MR) is the frequency of cache misses, while average miss penalty (AMP) is the cost of a cache miss in terms of time. Concretely it can be defined as follows.John L. Hennessy and David A. Patterson, Computer Architecture a Quantitative Approach Fifth Edition, 2012, pp.B9-B19 AMAT = H + MR cdot AMP It can also be defined recursively as, AMAT = H_1 + MR_1 cdot AMP_1 where AMP_1 = H_2 + MR_2 cdot AMP_2 In this manner, this recursive definition can be extended throughout all layers of the memory hierarchy.

He taught that an ‚Äúequal standard of human rights must be recognized and adopted.‚ÄùAbdu'l-Bah√°, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, US Bah√° º√≠ Publishing Trust, 1982 second edition, at 182. Bah√° ºu'll√°h called for governments to protect the human rights of their populations and to ensure their welfare. To safeguard human rights, He urged global leaders to establish a world commonwealth that would include a system of collective security to protect populations against tyranny and oppression.Brian Lepard, ‚ÄúA Baha ºi Perspective on International Human Rights Law‚Äù, University of Bebraska, Juxta Publishing 2012, at 3. http://bahai-library.com/pdf/l/lepard_bahai_perspective_rights.pdf. Divine basis for human rights The Bah√° º√≠ Writings make clear that human rights are not merely a political or social concept that is contingent on recognition by governments. Rather, the Bah√° º√≠ perspective is that human rights exist with or without governments; indeed, they are a divine endowment flowing from the creation of all human beings with the potential to reflect the attributes of God. All human beings have for this reason an equal spiritual dignity.Brian Lepard, ‚ÄúA Baha ºi Perspective on International Human Rights Law‚Äù, University of Bebraska, Juxta Publishing 2012, at 10. http://bahai- library.com/pdf/l/lepard_bahai_perspective_rights.pdf. Accordingly, governments have a moral obligation to respect this divine endowment, an obligation that would exist even in the absence of treaties or customary legal norms obligating them to do so. Bah√° ºu'll√°h impressed upon rulers this sacred duty: ‚ÄúFor is it not your clear duty to restrain the tyranny of the oppressor, and to deal equitably with your subjects, that your high sense of justice may be fully demonstrated to all mankind? God hath committed into your hands the reins of the government of the people, that ye may rule with justice over them, safeguard the rights of the down-trodden, and punish the wrong- doers.‚ÄùBah√° ºu'll√°h, Gleanings From the Writings of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, at 247. These are divinely-ordained responsibilities that no government can legitimately shirk.Brian Lepard, ‚ÄúA Baha ºi Perspective on International Human Rights Law‚Äù, University of Bebraska, Juxta Publishing 2012, at 10. http://bahai- library.com/pdf/l/lepard_bahai_perspective_rights.pdf. Bah√°'u'll√°h also teaches that because of this equal spiritual dignity, all human beings are members of a single human family that should be unified. This means that all should treat one another as brothers and sisters, and in turn honor and respect the rights of all other human beings, not only as co-equals, but as spiritual relatives. He declares, ‚ÄúYe are the fruits of one tree, and the leaves of one branch.‚ÄùBah√° ºu'll√°h, Gleanings From the Writings of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, at 288. Recognition of this fundamental connectedness is a precondition, according to the Bah√° º√≠ teachings, for the full realization of human rights. Bah√° ºu'll√°h asserts in this connection: ‚ÄúThe well-being of mankind, its peace and security, are unattainable unless and until its unity is firmly established.‚ÄùBah√° ºu'll√°h, Gleanings From the Writings of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, at 286. Human Rights will remain no more than a morally admirable concept so long as they are not anchored in such an appreciation for human unity. That unity provides the impetus, the motivation, the will, to uphold and defend the rights of others. And it implies that human rights are the concern of everyone, not just governments.Brian Lepard, ‚ÄúA Baha ºi Perspective on International Human Rights Law‚Äù, University of Bebraska, Juxta Publishing 2012, at 10. http://bahai- library.com/pdf/l/lepard_bahai_perspective_rights.pdf. Background The earliest use of the terminology of human rights in publications by Bah√° º√≠ institutions coincided with the inception of their official relationship with the United Nations. Three of the first four documents submitted to the newly established international organization in 1947 and 1948 were statements on various aspects of human rights intended as contributions to the preparatory work on the UDHR. The first of these was an eight-page statement entitled ‚ÄúA Bah√° º√≠ Declaration of Human Obligations and Rights‚Äù which was presented to the Human Rights Commission in February 1947 on behalf of eight national Bah√° º√≠ administrative bodies.Dr. Albert Lincoln, \\"Bah√° º√≠-Inspired Perspectives on Human Rights\\", at 7.http://juxta.com/wp-content/uploads/humanrights- electronic-1.2.pdf. The Bah√° º√≠ International Community (BIC) explains that concern for human rights can be found throughout the Bah√° º√≠ Writings. Bah√° ºu'll√°h, urged the rulers of the earth to ‚Äúrule with justice ... safeguard the rights of the down-trodden, and punish the wrong-doers.‚ÄùBah√° ºu'll√°h, Gleanings From the Writings of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, at 247. He taught that ‚Äúthere shall be an equality of rights and prerogatives for all mankind.‚ÄùAbdu'l-Bah√°, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, US Bah√° º√≠ Publishing Trust, 1982 second edition, at 318. Shoghi Effendi, the authorized interpreter of Baha ºu'll√°h's teachings, states that: ‚Äú[t]he unity of the human race, as envisaged by Bah√° ºu'll√°h, implies the establishment of a world commonwealth in which .... the autonomy of its state members and the personal freedom and initiative of the individuals that compose them are definitely and completely safeguarded. This commonwealth must, as far as we can visualize it, consist of a world legislature, whose members will, as the trustees of the whole of mankind, ultimately control the entire resources of all the component nations, and will enact such laws as shall be required to regulate the life, satisfy the needs and adjust the relationships of all races and peoples.‚ÄùShoghi Effendi, The World Order Bah√° ºu'll√°h, US Bah√° º√≠ Publishing Trust, 1991 first pocket-size edition, at 203. Moreover, in The Promise of World Peace, the Universal House of Justice (the supreme governing institution of the Faith) underscores the importance of the UDHR and its related conventions, asserting that ‚Äúall such measures, if courageously enforced and expanded, will advance the day when the specter of war will have lost its power to dominate international relations.‚ÄùThe Universal House of Justice, The Promise of World Peace. http://bahai.uga.edu/peace.html Bah√°'√≠ views on human rights are based on the concept that every person is essentially a spiritual being endowed by the Creator with talents and capacities, and that the purpose of life is to realize that potential for the benefit of society as well as the individual concerned. The equal dignity of all human beings and the need for both solidarity and legal equality among them are clearly posited in many passages of the Bah√° º√≠ sacred scriptures.Dr. Albert Lincoln, \\"Bah√° º√≠-Inspired Perspectives on Human Rights\\", at 7. http://juxta.com/wp- content/uploads/humanrights-electronic-1.2.pdf. These ideas are encapsulated in the concept of the ‚Äúoneness of mankind‚Äù, which is described as the ‚Äúpivot round which all the teachings of Bah√° ºu'll√°h revolve‚Äù.Shoghi Effendi, The World Order Bah√° ºu'll√°h, US Bah√° º√≠ Publishing Trust, 1991 first pocket-size edition, at 43. Illustrations of contributions to human rights issues by the Bah√° º√≠ community The Bah√° º√≠ community plays an active role in enhancing a culture of human rights. Scores of statements on various aspects of human rights have been released since the presentation of ‚ÄúA Bah√° º√≠ Declaration of Human Obligations and Rights‚Äù in 1947. The Bah√° º√≠ community is dedicated to the integration of human rights in every aspect of global community life and favours education as the main approach to the promotion and protection of human rights.\\"Bah√° º√≠-Inspired Perspectives on Human Rights\\", at 11. http://juxta.com/wp-content/uploads/humanrights-electronic-1.2.pdf. Gender equality Gender equality is a fundamental principle of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. Baha ºi belief states that the equality of the sexes is a spiritual and moral standard that is essential for the unification of the planet and the unfoldment of peace. The Bah√° º√≠ teachings note the importance of implementing the principle in individual, family, and community life. The BIC has released various statements on gender equality and particularly the role of women. In 1947, a statement entitled ‚ÄúElimination of Discrimination Against women‚Äù was presented to the 25th session of United Nations Commission on Human Rights on the Status of Women. As part of the statement, the BIC emphasized that the Baha'i Writings stress the principle of equality of education for men and women, as well as that of compulsory universal education, and elaborate the responsibilities of parents and of Bah√° º√≠ institutions to ensure equal opportunities in the education of children. In fact it is stated that if parents are not able to educate both boy and girl, the girl should be given preference because she is the future mother and first educator of the child. For the International Women's Year in 1975, the BIC released a pamphlet entitled ‚ÄúEquality of Men and Woman: A New Reality‚Äù which stated that equality of the sexes is, for Bah√° º√≠s, a spiritual and moral standard essential for the unification of the planet and the unfoldment of world order. Without the qualities, talents, and skills of both women and men, full economic and social development of the planet becomes impossible. For \\"[t]he world of humanity is possessed of two wings ‚Äî the male and the female. So long as these two wings are not equivalent in strength the bird will not fly. Until womankind reaches the same degree as man, until she enjoys the same arena of activity, extraordinary attainment for humanity will not be realized; humanity cannot wing its way to heights of real attainment.\\"Peace, Compiled by the Research Department of the Universal House of Justice, Bah√° º√≠ World Centre, August 1985 at page 40. http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/c/CP/cp-39.html. Eradicating poverty and rethinking prosperity In a statement in 2008 entitled ‚ÄúEradicating Poverty: Moving Forward as One‚Äù, the BIC offered two principles as guides for efforts in the realm of poverty eradication: justice and unity. They emphasised that these principles underlie a vision of development in which material progress serves as a vehicle for the moral and cultural advancement of humanity. Justice provides the means capable of harnessing human potential to eradicate poverty from our midst, through the implementation of laws, the adjustment of economic systems, the redistribution of wealth and opportunity, and unfailing adherence to the highest ethical standards in private and public life. Unity assures that progress is systemic and relational, that a concern for the integrity of the family unit and the local, national, and global community must guide poverty alleviation efforts. Furthermore, in 2010 in their contribution to the 18th session of United Nations Commission on Human Rights on sustainable development, Bah√° º√≠ International Community (BIC) challenged the assumption that human beings are slaves to self-interest and consumerism. In the statement ‚ÄúRethinking Prosperity: Forging Alternatives to a Culture of Consumerism‚Äù, they state that the transition to sustainable consumption and production is part of a global enterprise which enables all individuals to fulfill their dual purpose, namely to develop their inherent potentialities and to contribute to the betterment of the wider community. It is not enough to conceive of sustainable consumption and production in terms of creating opportunities for those living in poverty to meet their basic needs. Rather, with the understanding that each individual has a contribution to make to the construction of a more just and peaceful social order, these processes must be arranged in a way that permits each to play his or her rightful role as a productive member of society. Within such a framework, sustainable consumption and production could be characterized as processes that provide for the material, social and spiritual needs of humanity across generations and enable all peoples to contribute to the ongoing advancement of society.

The district includes a large collection of Native American rock art, including over 12,000 petroglyphs. The largest group of petroglyphs, which includes over 1,000 of the designs, is in Inscription Canyon. The more complex designs include humanoid figures, shields, masks, baskets, deer, bighorn sheep, and other plants and animals. Other petroglyphs represent patterns such as circles, lines, and zigzags. Native Americans made petroglyps in the area due to its abundance of easily marked lava rock and hard quartz for making etching tools.

Personal life In August 1996, Kullen contracted meningococcal meningitis sepsis. Kullen spent the next six weeks on life support in an induced coma. After coming out of the coma, she spent a further six months in hospital recovering from the illness and undergoing rehabilitation. Due to the illness both her legs were amputated, giving her restricted arm movement, limited strength and no function in both hands and wrists. Her internal organs continued to cause health complications due to the effect the illness had on her organs. In 2000, Kullen lost all function in both kidneys and relied on peritoneal dialysis four times a day. In 2003, her son Kyle was born prematurely, but he later died following complications of the birth. Career In 2000, Kullen started competing in dressage competitions with the Equestrian Federation of Australia for able-bodied riders and the RDAA for riders with a disability. Her finished international competition was the First International Combined Festival of Dressage at the International Para-Equestrian Competition in Belgium in 2006. At the 2007 FEI World Para Equestrian Dressage Championships, she won a silver and bronze medal. At the 2008 Beijing Paralympics, she finished fourth in the freestyle and eleventh in the championship. After Kullen's retirement from international duties she focused her time to her Arabian horses at Nikshar Stud. Her mother, Margaret Kullen, started entering her stallions in shows at which Nicole would show them from her wheelchair. She posed a question to the board of the Arabian Horse Society of Australia (AHSA) saying that, \\"there was no rule regarding showing horses from a wheelchair\\". The board responded after consultation with Kullen and introduced a new rule into the AHSA Rule Book allowing wheelchair users to compete.

He was a member of the house of Zollern-Hohenberg, a branch of the Swabian House of Hohenzollern which split off in the 12th century. Two stanzas in the Codex Manesse are attributed to him under the name of Albrecht von Haigerloch. Life Count and Vogt Albrecht was the son of Count Burchard V of Hohenberg and his wife Mechthild hereditary countess (Erbgr√§fin) from the family of Counts Palatine of T√ºbingen. On his father's death in 1253 he inherited the territory around Hohenberg Castle, Haigerloch and Rotenburg. His younger brother Burkhard VI. (d. 1318) inherited to lands of his mother around the castles of Nagold and Wildberg, and founded a separate Hohenberg line. Around 1280 Albrecht founded the town of Rotenburg (today Rottenburg am Neckar) near the existing castle as new administrative center of his county. A more central authority was necessary because of the constant territorial extensions of Hohenberg towards the Neckar. He was a supporter of his brother- in-law, the king Rudolf I of Habsburg, who was married to his older sister Gertrud Anna. He benefited from the rise of the Habsburgs; he was a close adviser to the king and accompanied him on several campaigns. In 1290 a visit of Albrecht to the court of Wenceslaus II of Bohemia is documented. Rudolf commissioned Albrecht as a bailiff (Landvogt) of the newly-formed territory of Niederschwaben to win back lost imperial territory. However Rudolph's plans to revive the Duchy of Swabia and win it over for the Habsburgs failed. After Rudolf's death Albrecht supported his son Albrecht of Austria against the elected king Adolf of Nassau-Weilburg. In 1298, while trying to prevent Otto III, Duke of Bavaria from uniting his army with Adolf's against Albrecht of Austria, Albrecht fell in the battle on the Kreuzwiesen near his castle of Leinstetten. Minstrel Codex Manesse: Count Albrecht II. in battle Albrecht is also noted as a minstrel. In the Codex Manesse on page 42r is a miniature showing him under the name of Count Albrecht of Haigerloch as a knight in battle (presumably the battle in which he fell). The back of the page contains the only two song verses ascribed to Albrecht. Descendants Albrecht was married three times. The name of his first wife is unknown. He had two children from this marriage: *Agnes m. 1281 Albrecht (d. 1292), Count of Gorizia and Tyrol *Albrecht III, called R√∂sselmann (d. 1304), Count of Hohenberg m.c. 1284, spouse unknown In 1282 he married Countess Margareta von F√ºrstenberg (d. 1296).

Wyeth was of English stock on his father's side. His ancestor, Nicholas Wyeth, emigrated to the United States from Saxtead in about 1640, and settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Harvard University was built near land owned by the Wyeth family. In 1832, Wyeth's grandfather, Dr. Jacob Wyeth, accompanied his brother Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth, part of the way to the then-wilderness of Oregon. On his return trip, he decided to move the family to Galena, Illinois. Through his father, Nathan Wyeth was a fourth cousin to the painter Newell Convers \\"N.C.\\" Wyeth, and the painter Andrew Wyeth was his fourth cousin once removed. Nathan's father, Charles, was the wealthy co-owner of Wyeth and Vandervoort, a company that sold malt for use by brewers of alcoholic beverages. He was also a member of the Chicago Board of Trade. Nathan was just a year old when his parents carried him to safety out of the city when the Great Chicago Fire struck in October 1871. The Tidal Basin Inlet Bridge with inlet gates (in white), one of Wyeth's earliest important commissions Charles Wyeth died in 1873 when Nathan was three years old. His will left $100,000 ($ in dollars) in trust for his wife and sons Nathan and Leonard. In 1881, Julia Wyeth married General Orlando B. Willcox, a lawyer who rose to the rank of Brevet Major General of Volunteers during the American Civil War and served as a colonel in the 29th Infantry Regiment after the war. Willcox later transferred to the 12th Infantry Regiment, and moved to San Francisco, California, to take up his command. He was appointed Commander of the Department of Arizona in 1878, and in 1886 was made head of the Department of the Missouri. He retired on April 16, 1887, at the rank of brigadier general in the regular army, after which he became governor of the Soldiers' Home in Washington, D.C., on February 27, 1889. But Nathan did not travel with his stepfather. Instead, he attended a series of boarding schools: Racine College (an Episcopal preparatory school in Racine, Wisconsin), the Harrington School (a preparatory school in New Bedford, Massachusetts), and Adams Collegiate Institute (a preparatory school in Sackets Harbor, New York). In 1888, N. Corwith and Company‚Äîthe firm which held the Wyeth funds in trust‚Äîwent bankrupt. The firm had commingled the Wyeth trust funds with those of its other businesses, and the bankruptcy wiped out the trust as well. The Wyeths sued, and the Supreme Court of Illinois held in their favor in 1888. Although it is unclear if the Wyeths recovered much money, enough was received to pay for Nathan and Leonard's secondary and higher education. Nathan was 18 years old in 1888. Despite the financial setbacks of his trust fund, he began his post-secondary education by studying watercolor painting in Belgium and Switzerland. Wyeth returned to the United States in the summer of 1889 and studied at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. He was awarded a first prize for his work, and graduated first in his class. In summer 1890, he enrolled as an art student at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, France. He studied under Duray Pascal, switched his major to architecture, and received his Architect Dipl√¥m√© par le Gouvernement from the school in 1899. Wyeth's first notable architectural design can be traced to 1891, while he was still studying in France. This effort was a fourth-floor addition to the Lemon Building at 1729 New York Avenue NW in Washington, D.C. It was an important commission, for the building was the headquarters of the American Institute of Architects. (The structure was razed in 1971.) Early work The Russell Senate Office Building, which Wyeth co-designed in 1903 and to which he designed the 1933 addition. The F.A. Keep/C.R. Peyton House (now the Embassy of Kenya), designed by Wyeth in 1906 and 1908. The West Wing of the White House, which Wyeth designed in 1909. The round walls of the Oval Office protrude from the structure. The USS Maine Mast Memorial, designed by Wyeth in 1913. The D.C. Armory, designed by Wyeth and completed in 1941. After graduating from the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts, Wyeth took a job with Carr√®re and Hastings, a New York City-based company that was one of the most prominent architectural firms in the United States. He left the firm in 1900 and moved to Washington, D.C., where he took a position at the Office of the Supervising Architect in the United States Department of the Treasury (the government agency which, at the time, designed all federal office buildings). After two and a half years there, he transferred to the office of the Architect of the Capitol, working under Elliott Woods. Although he worked there just eight months, there is evidence that he helped design both the Cannon House Office Building and the Russell Senate Office Building. Private practice Wyeth left government employment to form his own private architectural practice in 1904. During the next 14 years, he designed a large number of residences, office and retail buildings, and local government offices. In 1907, he briefly formed the firm of Wyeth & Cresson with noted local architect William Penn Cresson (husband of sculptor Margaret French Cresson). But the association lasted only a year. One of Wyeth's most prominent early commission was the Tidal Basin Inlet Bridge connecting East Potomac Park and West Potomac Park. Both parks were formerly part of the waters of the Potomac River. Beginning in 1881, material dredged from the river was placed in the tidal flats west and south of the city, creating the western half of the National Mall, the Washington Channel, and the Tidal Basin. The Tidal Basin was designed so that fresh water would flow in via its southern strait, and then flush outward into the Washington Channel. In 1907, the United States Army Corps of Engineers decided that gates were needed at the southern inlet to prevent the basin's water from backflowing into the Potomac (thus ensuring a flush into the channel). The Corps decided that a bridge should be built along with the gates, so that the roadway around the Tidal Basin would make a complete circuit. Wyeth was the only architect considered for the bridge job. His employment was approved in early February 1908, and by early April he'd completed the bridge plans. Although his design for a two-tier bridge was only partially implemented (the top tier was removed for budget reasons), work on the bridge was largely complete by June 1909. Among the many notable private residences Wyeth built during this first phase of his private practice were the Nathan C. and Isabelle Wells House at 1609 Connecticut Avenue NW in 1904; the new front facade and rear addition to the Dr. J. H. Bryan House at 818 17th Street NW in 1904; the Dr. Bernard L. Hardin House at 1313 Connecticut Avenue NW in 1905; the Anna Jenness Miller House at 2205 Massachusetts Avenue NW in 1905; the John R.

Wilmer House at 2101 R Street NW in 1912; and the Charles C. Glover House at 4200 Massachusetts Avenue NW in 1913. One of Wyeth's largest commissions in this period came in 1913, when he designed a new building for the Columbia Hospital for Women at 2425 L Street NW.; ; Government commissions An avid socialite, Wyeth's short time working for the federal government had won him a wide range of important friends. These led to a number of important commissions between 1904 and 1918. In 1909, he entered and won a competition to redesign the West Wing of the White House, turning a temporary structure into a permanent office complex. The Lemon Building addition had helped him win the commission, Wyeth's design for the West Wing, construction on which ended in October 1909, was a one-story structure which included the first and original Oval Office‚Äîwhich mimicked the Blue Room and Yellow Oval Room in the Executive Residence. (The Oval Office was moved in 1934 from the center of the south wall of the West Wing to the southeast corner of the building.) The following year, Wyeth oversaw the remodeling of the British Embassy in the District of Columbia. He was appointed \\"local architect\\" of the embassy in 1909, and held the position until 1919. Wyeth was hired to design the USS Maine Mast Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery in May 1913. Congress had approved a memorial in 1910, but little progress had been made. The United States Commission of Fine Arts (CFA), which had legal authority to advise regarding the siting and design of monuments and memorials, had reviewed preliminary designs submitted by the Army Corps of Engineers and had declined to approve any of them. Privately, the CFA voiced its opinion that the designs submitted were very poor. The commission advised the War Department to select a designer rather than hold a competition, and recommended Wyeth. The Secretary of War agreed, and Wyeth was hired in May 1913 to submit a design.; World War I and post-war work War work: 1917 to 1919 On October 17, 1917, Wyeth was hired by the United States Army Corps of Engineers to co-design the newly approved Francis Scott Key Bridge. Wyeth worked with Major Max C. Tyler, an engineer with the Corps of Engineers, to design the bridge, which crossed the Potomac River between the Rosslyn neighborhood of Arlington County, Virginia, and the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C. The bridge was completed in 1923. When the United States entered World War I in April 1918, Wyeth sought to join the military. He loved France, and was deeply upset at reports of the destruction and loss of life there. Too old at age 47 to be conscripted, he sought an architectural job with the Army as a way of helping the French people. Wyeth was released from his bridge contract with the Army Corps of Engineers in 1918 so he could be commissioned as a Major in the United States Army. For the duration of the war, he worked for the Hospital Division of the Office of the Surgeon General, designing temporary hospitals for construction in France. The war ended in November 1919. But Wyeth fell seriously ill after the war and moved to Switzerland to recover his health. He spent his time overseas painting watercolors, some of which were good enough to be exhibited at the Corcoran Gallery of Art. His works were also hung in the Missouri State Capitol. He did not return permanently to Washington until 1925. Post-war work After his return to the District of Columbia, Wyeth reopened his private practice. The post-war era was a difficult one for Wyeth. In 1924 or 1930 (sources vary), he formed an architectural firm with Francis P. Sullivan. Wyeth was appointed in 1925 to a group of architects which advised the District of Columbia Public Schools on the design of school buildings, and which provided design services to the school district. But his commissions from the city never materialized. In 1925, Wyeth joined many of the city's top architects in forming Allied Architects of Washington, D.C., Inc. Teams within this federation of architectural firms worked on some of the most important commissions in the city, and Wyeth joined Frank Upman, Gilbert LaCoste Rodier, and Louis Justement in co-designing the Longworth House Office Building. Commissions for major residences were much rarer now. Wyeth finished six significant works: The Judge Edwin B. Parker House at 2001 24th Street NW in 1926 (later the Embassy of Afghanistan);; the Justice Harlan Fiske Stone House at 2340 Wyoming Street NW in 1926; the Clarence A. Aspinwall House at 2340 Kalorama Street NW in 1928; the Duncan Phillips House at 2101 Foxhall Road NW in 1929; the Mrs. Wilber E. Wilder House (now the Embassy of Venezuela at 1099 30th Street NW in 1929 and the Frederick Atherton House (now the Embassy of Ivory Coast) at 2424 Massachusetts Avenue NW in 1930. All were co- designed with Francis P. Sullivan. Again with Sullivan, Wyeth co-designed the First Street Wing addition to the Russell Senate Office Building in 1933. One of Wyeth's few major commissions during this period was a group of homes on Whitehaven Street NW, near the British Embassy in Washington, D.C. (then under construction). A group of notable Washingtonians‚Äîincluding Senator Frederick H. Gillett, Colonel Reginald S. Huidekoper, and Commander Paul Bastedo‚Äîasked Wyeth to design large houses, all in the Georgian style, to occupy this block. (Architect Frederick H. Brooke also built a Georgian home here, but designed it himself.) The block already contained the McCormick House, a 1908 mansion designed by John Russell Pope for diplomat Robert Sanderson McCormick. With the start of the Great Depression in the United States in the fall of 1929, Wyeth received far fewer architectural commissions. The firm of Wyeth & Sullivan declared bankruptcy that year. Wyeth tried to rebuild his practice, but the depression left him without clients. In deep financial difficulty, he took a temporary position as the Municipal Architect of the District of Columbia in 1933. His appointment was made permanent on January 12, 1934. He remained in the position until his retirement at age 77 in 1946. As Municipal Architect, Wyeth designed and won approval of a master plan for Judiciary Square in 1934. He subsequently designed four buildings which helped to complete this master plan. The first of these, the D.C. Police Court Building, was located on the west side of 5th Street NW, and ran from E Street NW about three-quarters of the way to D Street NW. This structure began construction in September 1936 and was finished in April 1937. (This structure was razed in the mid-1960s.) The second structure was the D.C. Municipal Building (also known as the East Administration Building) at 300 Indiana Avenue NW. Construction started on December 10, 1938, and it was finished in May 1941. To complement the D.C. Police Court Building, Wyeth designed a third structure‚Äîthe D.C. Municipal Court Building, which occupied the east side of 4th Street NW between E and D Streets NW. It was completed in late 1941. (This structure was razed as well, and the site is now occupied by One Judiciary Square.) The northwest corner of the square itself had long been occupied by a small, Neoclassical structure housing the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. To balance this structure aesthetically, Wyeth designed a new fourth structure, the D.C. Juvenile Court Building at 410 E Street NW. It was completed in 1940. A fifth structure, the Recorder of Deeds Building, was built at 515 D Street NW immediately to the south of the D.C. Police Court Building. It opened in September 1941. Wyeth also personally designed the D.C. Armory (also known as the National Guard Armory) at 2001 East Capitol Street SE, which was completed in July 1941.; He also personally designed the Georgetown Neighborhood Library (finished in 1935) and the Petworth Neighborhood Library (finished in 1939) of the District of Columbia Public Library. Although a number of city schools were constructed while Wyeth was Municipal Architect, only two‚ÄîKelly Miller Junior High School (completed in 1949, razed in 2001) and Coolidge Senior High School‚Äîcan be directly attributed to him. Private life Wyeth married Dorothy Ellis Lawson (November 1, 1891 ‚Äì September 1975) of Cincinnati, Ohio, on September 20, 1911. Lawson was the cousin of Laura Lawson Blair, wife of Gist Blair. The Blairs were still the owners of Blair House, now a part of the White House Complex but then a private residence across the street from the White House. Dorothy was just 19 years old at the time, and Nathan Wyeth was 22 years her senior. The couple bonded over their mutual love of France. The couple had two children: Margo Julia (born in August 1912) and Stuart MacReynolds (born July 1914). Wyeth was described as nervous, and correct to the point of rudeness. He was an avid watercolorist, figure skater, and hiker. Wyeth was a member of the American Federation of Art, the American Legion, the American Planning and Civic Association, the Military Order of the World War, the Society of Beaux- Arts Architects, the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities, and the Washington Society of Fine Arts. He was also a member of the Alpine Club, Chevy Chase Club, Cosmos Club, and the Metropolitan Club. Death Nathan C. Wyeth died at his home in Washington, D.C., of natural causes on August 30, 1963. He was survived by his wife, Dorothy, and his children Margo and Stuart. He was interred in the Wyeth family plot at Mount Auburn Cemetery near Cambridge, Massachusetts. Writing 15 years after his death, architectural historians Sue A. Kohler and Jeffrey R. Carson concluded \\"...Wyeth was one of the more gifted architects practicing in Washington during the early years of this century.\\" Awards and paintings Wyeth was named a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects in 1914. He was elected the second vice president of the D.C. chapter of the American Institute of Architects in 1928. Wyeth designed his own home at 2915 44th Street NW in 1935, and lived in the structure for the rest of his life. The home was given an award for meritorious design by the Greater Washington Board of Trade in March 1936. In addition to several exhibitions of his watercolors, Wyeth also illustrated George H. Palmer's 1930 translation of The Odyssey. Notable works Embassy of Zambia at 2419 Massachusetts Avenue NW, designed by Wyeth in 1907. The Russian ambassador's residence at 1125 16th Street NW, designed by Wyeth in 1910. Wyeth designed a wide range of notable works: *Chilean ambassador's residence in Washington, D.C. (2305 Massachusetts Avenue NW; Sara S. Wyeth House, built 1909) *Columbia Hospital for Women (2425 L Street NW; built 1913) *D.C. Armory (2001 East Capitol Street SE; built 1941) *D.C.

Sullivan (Mrs. George Pullman House, 1125 16th Street NW; built 1910) Some sources say that Wyeth also co-designed the District of Columbia War Memorial with Frederick H. Brooke and Horace W. Peaslee. Wyeth's name is listed on the memorial as an associate architect. But the authoritative National Park Service Cultural Landscapes Inventory and an investigation into the memorial's creation by John G. Waite Associates (at the Park Service's request) show that the memorial was almost exclusively the work of Brooke, who designed it in 1919. Wyeth and Peaslee did not join the effort until March 1925. The exact nature of Wyeth's contributions are unknown, and appear minimal. As Waite et al. have noted: \\"No record has been found indicating that anyone but Brooke was ever considered for the job. Once the building was 'definitely to become a reality' with the passage of Resolution 28 in 1924, Brooke informed the memorial commission that Nathan C. Wyeth and Horace W. Peaslee had agreed to act as his associates in preparing the plans. It is not entirely clear what roles Wyeth and Peaslee played in designing the memorial; except for the inclusion of their names on some of the 1924 and 1925 drawings and the base inscription, they are rarely mentioned in connection with project, and what contractual arrangements were made with them are not known.\\" At best, only minor changes were made to the memorial after Wyeth joined the effort. It is widely assumed that, as Municipal Architect, Wyeth designed Thomas Jefferson Junior High School. For example, Harry Gabbett of The Washington Post makes the claim. Both The New York Times and The Evening Star also assume Wyeth designed the structure, although they erroneously report it was a high school. But Wyeth attributed the work to Jessie I. Cuthriel, architectural designer, and M.F. Coe, chief of the architectural division. Several sources also report that Wyeth designed Woodrow Wilson High School. But Wyeth told a subcommittee of the United States House Committee on Appropriations in March 1934 that he was only a consulting architect on the structure. The architectural design work on Woodrow Wilson High School was done by two private-sector architects under contract to the Office of the Municipal Architect. Although The New York Times claimed in his obituary that Wyeth designed the Canadian Embassy (now Uzbekistan's) at 1746 Massachusetts Avenue NW, but in fact the building was designed by architect Jules Henri de Sibour in 1909 for Clarence Moore and his wife, Mabelle Swift Moore (heir to the Swift meatpacking fortune).; References ;Notes ;Citations Bibliography        * External links * 1870 births 1963 deaths 20th- century American architects American watercolorists Architects from Washington, D.C.

It is a small, densely foliaged shrub with small heads of white or cream flowers in spring. It is closely related to Melaleuca marginata but can be distinguished from it by the number and character of leaf veins. Description Melaleuca ulicoides grows to a height of . Its leaves are arranged alternately, narrow triangular to narrow egg- shaped tapering to a sharp, prickly point and crescent-moon shape in cross section. The leaves are long, wide, glabrous when mature, have a distinct mid- vein on the lower surface and 4 other less obvious parallel veins. (Melaleuca marginata has between 7 and 17 equally indistinct veins.) There are also many distinct oil glands in the leaves. The flowers are white to cream-coloured and arranged in heads of 1 to 3 individual flowers, the heads up to in diameter. The petals are long and fall off as the flower matures. The stamens are arranged in bundles of five around the flower, with 18 to 28 stamens in each bundle. Flowers appear in October or November and are followed by fruit which are woody capsules long with teeth around the edge. Ravensthorpe Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca ulicoides was first described in 2010 by Lyndley Craven in Nuytsia from a specimen collected in 1965 by Alex George. The specific epithet (ulicoides) is a reference to the similarity of this species to a species of gorse Ulex in the pea family, Fabaceae.

In 1856 Pomeroy graduated from Wesleyan University with a bachelor's and master's of arts, and 1875, he graduated from Simpson Centenary College in Indianola, Iowa with a doctorate. Early career In 1854, Pomeroy started his long career in education by teaching Greek at Fort Edward Institute in Fort Edward, New York. From 1855 to 1860, Pomeroy served as a principal at four different institutions: Union Village Academy for one year, Rochester High School for two years, and Genesee Wesleyan Seminary for one year. Kansas State Normal School presidency The Kansas Board of Regents selected Pomeroy as the Kansas State Normal School's third president in October 1873. He would begin his tenure on January 1, 1874. Because the economy was poor, Pomeroy was unable to pay the professors and staff and also had to work without salary; the board voted that bonds would be paid to teachers as a way of thanking them for their service during the school year on July 2, 1879. During Pomeroy's tenure, a tornado had hit in April 1878 and destroyed the main building on campus, which was followed by a fire that destroyed the two buildings at the school. On August 6, 1879, Pomeroy resigned as president. Later career After serving four years as president of the Normal School in Emporia, Pomeroy became Callahan College's president for six years. From 1886 to 1899, Pomeroy served as the Dean and a professor at the University of Puget Sound in Washington (state). Personal life On December 2, 1854, Pomeroy married Mary J.

Usually they do not extend to the thyroid cartilage. They may be present congenitally or may develop eventually due to degenerative cause. They often interfere with phonation. Presentation Hoarseness is the most common presenting symptom, while pain, stridor or laryngeal obstruction are unusual complaints. They may cause significant respiratory obstruction leading to dyspnoea or respiratory distress and even cyanosis, and jugular and epigastric retractions. Congenital lesions may present with severe airway obstruction at birth calling for emergency intervention and intubation. Diagnosis Types There are three types of laryngeal cysts, namely, mucous, hemorrhagic and congenital. However, a new classification system for congenital laryngeal cysts on the basis of the extent of the cyst and the embryologic tissue of origin, is proposed for the ease of initial surgical management. Treatment Treatment can be medical or surgical. Laser endoscopic treatment is often preferred. Voice therapy is sometimes necessary. Epidemiology Congenital cysts of the larynx with incidence of about 1.8 in 100,000 newborns. Laryngeal cysts form 4% of all laryngeal tumors or about 5% of benign laryngeal lesions.

History During the French colonisation from 1830 to 1962, according to Benrabah, French \\"symbolized foreign exploitation and was thus to be resisted\\" but that \\"it served as a tool to raise the population's awareness and support in favour of such resistance\\" because French conveyed \\"universal values\\" of liberty, equality, and fraternity. During the colonial period, about one million French native speakers lived in Algeria. The pied-noirs developed a distinctive dialect, termed Pataou√®te. In 1963, of the 1,300,000 literate people in Algeria, 1 million read French. Of the total population, 6 million spoke French. In the 1960s, post-independence Algerian politicians intended to carry out an Arabization campaign to replace the usage of French with Modern Standard Arabic.Benrabah \\"Language maintenance and spread: French in Algeria\\", p. 193-194. The Algerian government taught French as the first mandatory foreign language for students beginning in the fourth grade in the primary cycle, from the end of the 1970s to the early 1990s. In September 1993 the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education made French and English two separate choices for the first mandatory foreign language; students were required to pick one over the other; the great majority of students selected French as their first mandatory foreign language. Opponents of French-Arabic bilingualism in Algeria argued that French was a colonialist and imperialist language. A report for the High Council of Francophonie in Paris stated in 1986 that in Algeria, 150,000 people spoke French as a first language and 6.5 million spoke French as a second language. The total population of Algeria at the time was 21 million.Meisler, Stanley. \\"Seduction Still Works : French--a Language in Decline.\\" Los Angeles Times. March 1, 1986. Retrieved on May 18, 2013. Benrabah said that \\"[f]rom a quantitative point of view, today's Algeria is the second largest French-speaking community in the world\\" and that \\"Arabization, or the language policy implemented to displace French altogether, failed.\\" In 1990, 6,650,000 people in Algeria spoke French, with 150,000 being native speakers and 6,500,000 being second-language speakers. In 1993, of 27.3 million people in Algeria, 49% spoke French. At the time, studies predicted that 67% of the Algerian population would speak French by 2003. The Abassa Institute polled 1,400 Algerian households in April 2000 about their language use. Of them, 60% spoke and/or understood the French language. The institute used its findings to represent the 14 million Algerian citizens who were of the age 16 or older. Benrabah said that the polls confirm the trend of French increasing in Algeria. Maamri said that in 2009, due to the advent of satellite television channels that carry Francophone entertainment, the language \\"is now enjoying something of a revival.\\" She added that \\"Also over the years, the Algerian government has pushed back, reintroducing French.\\" In 2014, 76% of Facebook users in Algeria posted in French, while 32% posted in Arabic.

The choice of language of Algerian leaders in public reflects their language policy: Houari Boum√©di√®ne, second president of Algeria from 1965 to 1978, was strongly against French and never used it publicly. Chadli Bendjedid, third president of the country, used only classical Arabic in his speeches, as did Liamine Z√©roual. Other political leaders, such as Mohamed Boudiaf and Abdelaziz Bouteflika, had a more favourable attitude towards French. Bouteflika in particular believed that the Francophone dimension of Algeria was evident in the impact of thinkers such as Descartes and the parallels between the French and Algerian revolutions. Usage some two- thirds of Algerians have a \\"fairly broad\\" grasp of French, and half speak it as a second language. \\"Mais tous les arabophones d'Alg√©rie parlent l'arabe dialectal ou l'arabe dit alg√©rien (ou ses diverses vari√©t√©s) pour communiquer entre eux.

They live in Oceania at coastal regions of the Australian continent, the Indonesian islands, New Guinea, and the Philippines. It is usually sedentary and pairs breed at the same nest site, building up a substantial structure on dead trees or limbs. The species resides in habitat close to coasts and estuaries that provide opportunities for fishing. The eastern osprey's diet consists mostly of vertebrate fish species. It possesses specialised physical characteristics and exhibits unique behaviour to assist in hunting and catching prey. Taxonomy A description as species Buteo cristatus was published in 1816 by the French ornithologist Louis Vieillot,Vieillot, L.P. 1816. New Dictionary of Natural History, applied arts, agriculture, rural and domestic √âcomomie in medicine, etc..By a company of naturalists and farmers. Paris : Chez Deterville Vol. 4 pp. [481]. which came to be cited as a subspecies or race of a widely distributed species. The epithet cristatus is derived from the Latin for 'crested' in reference to the stiff tuft of feathers that extend from the nape. The subspecific treatment Pandion haliaetus cristatus distinguishes the crest from other subspecies of P. haliaetus, the name taken from ancient Greek haliaietos for 'sea eagle'. Later authors described the regional population as separate species‚ÄîPandion leucocephalus Gould, J. 1838 and Pandion gouldi Kaup, J.J. 1847‚Äîor as subspecies‚ÄîPandion haliaetus australis Burmeister, K.H.K. 1850 and Pandion haliaetus melvillensis Mathews, G.M. 1912. Gould's description identified several characteristics that distinguished his new species from widespread Pandion haliaetus, based on specimens collected in Tasmania, Rottnest Island in the west, and Port Essington; the accompanying lithograph illustrating the species‚Äîpublished in the Synopsis (1838) to Birds of Australia‚Äîwas executed by Elizabeth Gould. Some authorities maintain a treatment of the 'eastern osprey' population as one of four subspecies of Pandion haliaetus, the only extant species of the genus and family. When specimens and observations of new populations were published in the nineteenth century, many authors described these as new species, revisions around the beginning of the twenty first century began to suggest that status as a full species was warranted. Illustration of head by Eilzabeth Gould, published 1838. The Australian Faunal Directory recognises a full species treatment, citing a 2008 revision that noted genetic distance comparable to closely related species of Hieraeetus and Aquila (Wink, et al., 2004) and minor but consistent distinctions in morphology and plumage colour. Behavioural differences between the three contentious populations include this species residence at marine habitat, whereas the North American population is found breeding and colonising sites near freshwater. Pandion, described by the French zoologist Marie Jules C√©sar Savigny in 1809, is the sole genus of the family Pandionidae; it is named for a mythic Greek figure known as Pandion. Some arrangements place it alongside the hawks and eagles in the family Accipitridae‚Äîwhich itself can be regarded as making up the bulk of the order Accipitriformes‚Äîor else allied with the Falconidae into Falconiformes. The Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy has placed it together with the other diurnal raptors in a greatly enlarged Ciconiiformes, but this results in an unnatural paraphyletic classification. They are known by the common name osprey, or distinguished as the eastern osprey, other names include fish hawk and white-headed osprey. Gould noted the informal vernacular used after settlement of Australia, the 'Little Fish-Hawk' in New South Wales and 'Fish-Hawk' recorded at the Swan River Colony by John Gilbert; the extant names for the species were Joor-jout at Port Essington and another in southwest Australia, transliterated from the Nyungar language; this latter name has proposed for common use in southwest Australia as yoondoordo [pronounced yoon‚Äôdoor‚Äôdaw].  Description  The species Pandion cristatus, comparable in size as a medium-sized raptor or large hawk, occurs near the coast and large water bodies and is highly adapted to hunt and capture marine animals. The plumage is dark brown on the upper surfaces, and pale at the head and lower parts. The throat is white, a black line extends from this through the eye to a dark patch around the ear, demarcating this from the pale colour at the head. When not in flight, the feathers at the crown form a small crest. The breast is dappled with brownish patches, lacing below the neck, this is darker and more strongly banded in the female. The female of the species also tends to be larger. The wing measurements of the females range from 410 to 478 millimetres, males are 391 to 470 mm. The weight of the female is 1.2 to 1.6 kilograms, males are 0.9 to 1.2 kg. The size range of the black bill is 29 to 35 millimetres, and the upper mandible is acutely hooked. The legs and feet of the species are strong and a light grey or white colour. The pattern of the scales at the tarsus is reticulate. The irides are yellow. The juveniles resemble adults, although the iris colour is a darker orange-yellow and plumage is distinguishable in multiple and subtle ways. In flight, the eastern osprey has bowed wings with narrow primary feathers that are angled and separate, giving a fingered appearance to the observer below. The eyes are set toward the front of the head, which along with the neck is proportionally small. The species swivels and cranes its neck while observing its surroundings in a curious and characteristic manner. The osprey resembles the white-bellied sea eagle Haliaeetus leucogaster, which has similar habitat and range, although the adult size is only that of the larger species' juvenile; the wings of an osprey are sharply angled rather than the up-swept outline of the soaring eagle. Ospreys differ in several respects from other diurnal birds of prey, toes are of equal length, its tarsi are reticulate, and its talons are rounded, rather than grooved. The eastern and western osprey (Pandion) and owls (Strigiformes) are the only hunters whose outer toe is reversible, allowing them to grasp their prey with two toes in front and two behind. This is particularly helpful when they grasp slippery fish.  Distribution and habitat  The states and territories of Australia where the species is recorded as occurring are Western Australia, the Northern Territory, Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania, The range is a narrow strip at the coast and offshore islands, although it is occasionally found at open river systems and beyond tidal plains. Visits to inland regions from the north during the wet season may occur in years of heavier rainfall. On this continent it is mainly sedentary, non-migratory, in contrast to the other subspecific populations of Pandion haliaetus. They occur patchily around the coastline, although it is a non-breeding visitor to eastern Victoria and Tasmania. There is a gap, corresponding with the coast of the Nullarbor Plain, between its westernmost breeding site in South Australia and the nearest breeding sites at the southwest of Australia. The species had been reported as uncommon in the southeast of Australia. Other regions inhabited by the species at the Philippines, Indonesia and New Guinea. Seasonal visitors to Sulawesi arrive from the south, and these are presumed to have migrated from the north of Australia. The tree selected as a roost or nest site in Australia is a large eucalypt. They may be seen in flight over a variety of habitats occurring between their residence and hunting waters.  Behaviour  The species is solitary of paired with a breeding partner, the association of several individuals in family groups are unusual records. They are a diurnal species, ranging out from a nest or perch over water bodies during daylight, but have been recorded hunting at night. Their flight may be high, soaring over and surveying the water, or quartering closer to the surface; some flight is seemingly unrelated to hunting.  Hunting  The diet is largely local species of fish, although a favoured target in Australia is known to be mullet when available. Occasional records are given for other marine life‚Äîsea snakes, molluscs and crustaceans‚Äîand for terrestrial species of reptiles, insects, birds and mammals. They are known to capture sea birds in flight. Ospreys have vision that is well adapted to detecting underwater objects from the air. Prey is first sighted when the eastern osprey is 10 to 40 metres above the water, after which the bird hovers momentarily then plunges feet first with wings raised; a large splash is made as it enters the water. The descent toward their prey may be done in stages, and they may immerse themselves up to a depth of 1 metre. After seizing their target they use heavy wing beats to rise from the water's surface, resuming a regular action with the fish being carried head first toward the shore. The prey is \\"slung torpedo-fashion\\" with a leading foot behind the head and the other clasping behind, this aligning habit distinguishes Pandion from indifferent clutching of prey by fishing eagles. Their large prey is not swallowed immediately, instead being butchered at a perch or nest site outside the breeding season. osprey with catch at Peel Harvey Estuary The genus Pandion has several adaptations that suit its piscivorous lifestyle, these include reversible outer toes, sharp spicules on the underside of the toes, closable nostrils to keep out water during dives, and backwards-facing scales on the talons which act as barbs to help hold its catch. The osprey has dense plumage which is oily and prevents its feathers from getting waterlogged. Reproduction Rocky outcrops just offshore are used in Rottnest Island off the coast of Western Australia, where there are 14 or so similar nesting sites of which five to seven are used in any one year. Many are renovated each season, and some have been used for 70 years. The nest is a large heap of sticks, driftwood, turf or seaweed that is usually built in the fork of a dead tree or limb, cliff faces are also utilised. trees, rocky outcrops, utility poles, artificial platforms or offshore islets. Continually occupied nest structures may reach up to two metres in height. Nests can be as wide as 2 meters and weighing about 135 kg. Generally, eastern ospreys reach sexual maturity and begin breeding around the age of three to four years. Eastern ospreys usually mate for life, although polyandry has been recorded in several instances. The breeding period varies according to local seasons: this begins between September and October in southern Australia, April to July in northern Australia and June‚ÄìAugust in southern Queensland. In spring the pair begins a five-month period of partnership to raise their young. The clutch size is usually two to three eggs, sometimes up to four, and are able to brood twice in a season. These are laid within a month, and relies on the size of the nest to conserve heat. The egg shell is white or buff with bold splotches and spots of reddish-brown, sometimes so dark as to be black; purple or grey blotches may appear beneath the surface of the shell. The egg measurements are about 62 x 45 millimetres and weigh about 65 grams. The eggs are incubated for about 35‚Äì43 days to hatching.Poole, Alan F. Ospreys, A Natural and Unnatural History 1989 The newly hatched chicks weigh 50 to 60 grams and fledge in 8 to 10 weeks. A study on Kangaroo Island had an average time between hatching and fledging of 69 days. The same study found an average of 0.66 young fledged per year per occupied territory, and 0.92 young fledged per year per active nest. Some 22% of surviving young either remained on the island or returned at maturity to join the breeding population. When food is scarce, the first chicks to hatch are most likely to survive. The typical lifespan is 7‚Äì10 years, though rarely individuals can grow to as old as 20‚Äì25 years. A nest examined in 1902 found fish skeletons at the edge and a seaside plant 'pig- face' (Mesembryanthemum) in full growth. Status and conservation There is evidence for regional decline in South Australia where former territories at locations in the Spencer Gulf and along the lower Murray River have been vacant for decades. Nesting sites on the Eyre Peninsula and Kangaroo Island are vulnerable to unmanaged coastal recreation and encroaching urban development. In New South Wales, the osprey is a protected species. For this reason, conservationists cannot move a nest of ospreys from the bottom left light tower of Central Coast Stadium. The conservation status in Western Australia is as 'not threatened', relatively common in the North and less frequently recorded in the south. A 1902 report by Alexander Milligan of a breeding pair in the southwest region was published in The Emu, and a description of a nest with two eggs located at Cape Mentelle which had been photographed eleven years earlier by A. J. Campbell. One egg was taken for deposit at the state's museum by Milligan and along with the museum's director, B. H. Woodward, charged the warden of the cave system with protection of the site. The species is rare in Victoria and now absent from Tasmania.

The aircraft's passengers were on a business trip from Atlanta, Georgia to Martinsville, Virginia, aboard an Aero Commander 680 Super twin engine aircraft owned and operated by Colorado Aviation Co, Inc. The aircraft crashed into the side of Brushy Mountain, 14 nautical miles northwest of Roanoke, Virginia during conditions of poor visibility. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) concluded that the crash was caused by the pilot's decision to continue operating under visual flight rules (VFR) into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), combined with his lack of experience in the aircraft type. Accident On the morning of May 28, 1971, an Aero Commander 680 Super prepared to depart DeKalb‚ÄìPeachtree Airport in Atlanta. It was operating as a non-scheduled passenger air taxi flight under visual flight rules to its destination of Blue Ridge Airport in Martinsville, 284 nautical miles northeast, with an estimated flight time of 1 hour 46 minutes. Before takeoff the pilot requested a weather report by phone and decided weather along the route was safe for visual flying. No flight plan was required and none was filed. Air traffic control at Peachtree cleared the flight and the aircraft departed at 09:10 EST. As the flight continued, weather conditions deteriorated, and two hours twenty minutes after take off, at 11:30 several residents of Galax, Virginia (60 miles due west of Martinsville), reported seeing the Aero Commander flying circles in and out of the clouds at approximately 150 feet above ground level (AGL). Shortly afterward the aircraft unsuccessfully attempted to land on a four-lane highway northwest of Galax. After making a pass over the town at near treetop level, the aircraft left the area heading west towards the Blue Ridge Mountains. The last communication with the aircraft was at 11:49, when the pilot contacted the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Flight Service Station at Roanoke's Woodrum Airport asking for a weather report and saying he intended to land there. At this point the aircraft had flown past its destination of Martinsville and was west of and below the peaks of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The latest weather report radioed by Roanaoke was \\"measured ceiling 1,000 feet broken, 2500 feet overcast, visibility 3 miles in light rain and fog, with mountain ridges obscured\\". The pilot did not indicate he was in any kind of trouble or report the aircraft's current position. At 12:08 the aircraft impacted the west side of Brushy Mountain at the 2,700-foot level while flying at \\"high speed level attitude\\" on a heading of 100 degrees to the Roanoke VORTAC navigation beacon. The collision into the heavily wooded slope and post crash fire destroyed the aircraft, and all six people on board received fatal injuries. Departure and destination airport locations Aircraft Registered as N601JJ, the aircraft was a fourteen-year-old 680 Super seven-seat light twin, type certified on October 14, 1955, and manufactured in 1957 by Aero Commander. Serial number 680-491-161 was equipped with 340 hp Lycoming GSO-480-B1A6 supercharged engines, turning Hartzell 3-bladed feathering propellers. Maximum takeoff weight was with a total fuel load of 225.5 US gal, giving a 1,480-mile range at a cruise speed of 230 mph. Because of these features the 680 Super is considered a complex multiengine airplane. Crew and passengers The single crewmember was 43-year-old pilot Herman Butler, who held a valid private pilot license with airplane single- and multi-engine land rating, but was not rated to fly under instrument flight rules (IFR). Butler had over 8,000 hours of flight experience, but only 6 hours logged in the newly acquired Aero Commander. He was also the secretary of Colorado Aviation Co., Inc. Among the five passengers was Audie Murphy, the most decorated U.S. veteran of World War II and a director of Colorado Aviation's parent company, Telestar Leisure Investments. Aftermath Friends were waiting at Martinsville, and when the aircraft failed to arrive, they were told the flight had changed destinations to Roanoke. Late that afternoon in Roanoke it became clear the aircraft was missing and a search was initiated. Civil Air Patrol in Danville, Virginia, began searching with help from units in Buckingham, Hillsville, Lynchburg, Martinsville, and Roanoke. The Eastern Air Search and Rescue Center at Robins Air Force Base also launched 31 aircraft, in support of the search. Due to poor weather conditions and the lack of a flight plan, the crash site was not located until May 31. Colonel Hale and Major Slusser of the Virginia Wing of the Civil Air Patrol discovered the accident site approximately 300 feet below the summit of Brushy Mountain at 2:30 in the afternoon. Later that day rescue workers were able to reach the area after hiking up four miles of steep terrain. Three passengers, including Murphy, had been thrown uphill from the wreckage and were identified on site. The remaining three were found within the cabin of the aircraft and were badly burned. Investigation The accident was investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board and centered on the weather at the time of the crash and the pilot's abilities. There was no evidence of any pre-impact malfunction of the aircraft, and in their final report, issued on June 15, 1972, the NTSB determined the following official probable cause for the accident: \\"[T]he pilot's attempt to continue visual fight into adverse weather conditions at an altitude too low to clear the mountainous terrain. The Board also finds that the pilot attempted to continue flight into instrument weather conditions which were beyond his operational capabilities.\\" Civil lawsuit In December 1971 the family of Audie Murphy (his wife and two sons) hired attorney Herbert Hafif and filed a $10 million lawsuit in Los Angeles District Court alleging negligence in the operation and maintenance of the aircraft. The 13 defendants included the estate of pilot Herman Butler, the estates of passengers Claude Crosby and Jack Littleton, Aero Commander Inc, Colorado Aviation Co. Inc, and Telestar, Inc. In December 1975 a jury awarded the Murphy family $2.5 million in damages to be paid by the aircraft's owner, Colorado Aviation Inc. of Denver, Colorado.

Unlike many bacteria, Vampirovibrio chlorellavorus is an obligate parasite, attaching to the cell wall of green algae of the genus Chlorella.Atterberry, R.J., Hobley, L., Till, R., Lambert, C., Capeness, M.J., Lerner, T.R., Fenton, A.K., Barrow, P., and Sockett, R.E. 2011. Effects of orally ministered Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus on the well-being and Salmonella colonization of young chicks. Journal of Applied and Environmental Microbiology. 77.16: 5794-5803. Vampirovibrio originates from the Serbian vampir (Cyrillic: –≤–∞–º–ø–∏—Ä). meaning vampire (due to the nature of sucking out cellular contents of its prey) and vibrio referring to the bacterial genus of curved rod bacterium. Chlorellavorus is named for the host of the bacterium (Chlorella) and the Latin voro meaning \\"to devour\\" (Chlorella-devouring).\\"Vampirovibrio.\\" List of Prokaryotic Names with Standing in Nomenclature. Web. Classification The bacterium, first described by Gromov and Mamkayeva in 1972, was originally classified in the genus Bdellovibrio.\\"Vampirovibrio Chlorellavorus Gromov & Mamkayeva, 1980.\\" WoRMS - World Register of Marine Species - Vampirovibrio Chlorellavorus Gromov & Mamkayeva, 1980. World Register of Marine Species, 2014 It was then reclassified as its own genus Vampirovibrio in 1980 after being excluded from the genus Bdellovibrio for some essential discrepancies. The most significant difference was that members of Bdellovibrio are extracellular parasites, both residing and dividing in the periplasmic space in its host, whereas Vampirovibrio is epibiotic, attaching to the cell wall of green algae in the genus Chlorella. It was also thought that the bacterium utilized a thin, uncovered flagellum for motility.Gromov, B.V., and Mamkaeva K.M. (1972) Electron Microscope Study of Parasitism by Bdellovibrio Chlorellavorus Bacteria on Cells of the Green Algae Chlorella Vulgaris. Tsitologiya. 14.2: 256-260. However, it was later discovered that the bacterium was non-motile, further differentiating it from members of Bdellovibrio. Further research however suggests that the latest classification of V. chlorellavorus is still incorrect. By analyzing the genome of V. chlorellavorus Soo and Hugenholtz determined that the organism was more accurately a Cyanobacteria rather than a Proteobacteria. Using 16S rRNA analysis, scientists have estimated that this bacterium most closely belongs to the SM1D11 lineage of bacteria.Li, H., Chen, C., Sun, Q., Liu, R., and Cai, J. Vampirovibrio chlorellavorus is related to the family Bdellovibrionacae, which has been described as Bdellovibrio and like organisms or BALOs. Bdellovibrio and like organisms enhanced the growth and survival of Panaeus monodon and altered community rearing structures in its rearing water. 2014. Journal of AEM. 80.20: 6346-6354. In addition, when compared to other Cyanobacteria, Vampirovibrio is non-photosynthetic and could possibly belong to a new proposed classification called Melainobacteria, from Greek root words meaning ‚Äúnymph of dark waters.‚Äù. It has been subsequently concluded that phylum Cyanobacteria, proposed class Melainabacteria, order Vampirovibrionales, and family Vampirovibrionaceae more accurately classified the organism. Preliminary Characterization Vampirovibrio chlorellavorus is a gram-negative obligate aerobic and epibiotic parasitic bacterium with a curved comma shape.Hugenholtz, P., and Soo, R.M. 2015. Recent summary of research on Vampirovibrio chlorellavorus that was also partially discussed at the March 2015 Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute Genomics of Energy and Environment Meeting. Personal correspondence. The bacterium attaches to the surface of green algae of the genus Chlorella. V. chlorellavorus is an extracellular parasite and remains attached to the cell wall. Once attached to its host, V. chlorellavorus divides by binary fission, destroying its host in the process by ‚Äúsucking out‚Äù all of the cellular contents via peripheral vacuolesGromov, BV. \\"Electron Microscope Study of Parasitism by Bdellovibrio Chorellavorus Bacteria on Cells of the Green Alga Chorella Vulgaris.\\" Tsitologiya 14.2 (1972): 256-60. Print. much like a vampire (hence the name Vampirovibrio). V. chlorellavorus leaves behind only the cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane of Chromatium along with a few intracytoplasmic inclusions. V. chlorellavorus will not grow in axenic cultures, depending on access to living cells of its preferred algae host, Chlorella vulgaris for reproduction. The Vampirovibrio life cycle consists of: prey location, attachment, ingestion, binary division, and release. Discovery and Isolation Gromov and Mamkaeva first isolated Bdellovibrio chlorellavorus in a lysis experiment with the algae Chlorella vulgaris from Ukrainian reservoir waters from a mass culture of Chlorella Beijer in 1966. In a later experiment, the scientists were then able to cultivate B. chlorellavorus together with Chlorella vulgaris at 24 degrees Celsius and pH 6.8 in a liquid agar solution under fluorescent lighting (at an average of 2100 lux). Genomics Dr. Hugenholtz and colleagues from the University of Queensland in Australia, have completed shotgun sequencing of lyophilized cells of V. chlorellavourus strain Gromov B, Mamkaeva K. 1980.

Subsequently, Soo and Hugenholtz's team performed a genomic reconstruction in 2014 from a culture previously deposited into the NCBI collection in 1978 and were able to make a general metabolic reconstruction of the genome They found that V. chlorellavorus uses a type IV secretion system (T4SS), similar to that of Agrobacterium tumefaciens for host invasion, which is conserved in all three copies of the V. chlorellavorus genome.Hugenholtz, P. 2015. Back from the dead, the curious tale of the predatory cyanobacterium Vampirovibrio chlorellavorus. March 2015 DOE JGI Genomics of energy and environment meeting. Web. To locate its prey, V. chlorellavorus seems to be equipped with possible genes for aerotaxis and light activated kinase (moving towards light), suggesting that it might be motile as was originally thought. To digest its algal prey, V. chlorellavorus has over 100 hydrolytic enzymes including proteases and peptidases. From the results of Soo and her team's genomic analysis, V. chlorellavorus has approximately 26 contigs, 2.91 Mbp, an average GC content of 51.4%, and 2 circular plasmids. In keeping with its description as non-photosynthetic and parasitic microorganism, V. chlorellavorus does not have its own genes for photosynthesis or carbon fixation. V. chlorellavorus is however capable of synthesizing its own nucleotides, certain cofactors and vitamins, and 15 different amino acids. Its bacterial genome also includes coding for a complete glycolysis pathway as well as an electron transport chain. Research and Implications Vampirovibrio or Bdellovibrio may be used to help control harmful populations of bacteria due to their predatory nature. In an experiment where Bdellovibrio were added to a shrimp tank to consume populations of bacteria, the target bacterial populations declined by up to 44%. However the Bdellovibrio population declined as well after consuming most of the available bacteria. Therefore, use of Bdellovibrio as an inhibitor of other bacteria shows potential, but may be limited to certain cases as Bdellovibrio prefers certain strains, such as gram-negative bacteria. In a subsequent experiment, chickens, highly susceptible to cecal or gut infections, were used in an experiment in which scientists purposely infected chickens with a pathogenic form of Salmonella enterica. The chicken were then exposed to Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, after which a reduction in inflammation and other harmful changes in the chickens‚Äô ceca were observed as a result of decreased Salmonella populations. The success of this experiment suggest there is significant potential for Bdellovibrio in bioremediation. Since Vampirovibrio chlorellavorus has not been cultured in recent years, it is possible to learn about its future research applications by learning about the methods in which Bdellovibrio and like organisms, or BALOs, are used to control pathogenic bacteria.

The structure of the Re-ED program was inspired in large part by residential programs in post-World War II Scotland and France addressing mental health needs in children resulting from effects of the war. These programs were staffed largely by teachers who received primarily on-the-job practical training in psychological therapy. Following that model, Project Re-ED carefully selected effective, experienced teachers with demonstrated adaptability and creativity, and provided them with one year of graduate level practical and theoretical training in working with emotionally disturbed children.  Philosophy  Development of the program was guided by social learning theory and ecological theory, and the program takes an educational rather than a therapeutic approach. Following social learning theory, the program considers it important to focus on assisting children to learn new and more positive ways to interact with others in a social setting. Following ecological theory, the program emphasizes a holistic approach of addressing issues in the family, school, peer group, and other social settings of a child's life together at the same time. This way, counsellors can see how troubling issues in each of these social settings influence each other, rather than addressing each setting in isolation.Duchnowski, A. J. Kutash, K. & Friedman, R. M. (2002). Community- based interventions in a system of care and outcomes framework. In B. J. Burns, & K. Hoagwood (Eds). Community treatment for youth: Evidence-based interventions for severe emotional and behavioral disorders. New York: Oxford University Press, pp.16-37. The approach of the re-education method is to view emotionally disturbed children's problems as symptoms resulting from problems in the child's social settings. So, rather than seeing the goal as curing a child's mental illness in long-term private, individual therapy, the program seeks to restructure a child's environment and teach the child how to act more constructively and positively within that environment.  Evaluation  Follow-up studies indicate that the program does effectively attain its goal of restoring and improving social operation of children and their environment in a relatively short amount of time (with an average stay in the program of about 7 months) relative to similar children not in the program. A study of the results in children ages 6‚Äì12 found a substantial reduction in problem behaviors among former students in the program, with greater gains associated with younger age and a longer stay in the program.Fields, E., Farmer, E. M. Z., Apperson, J., Mustillo, S., & Simmers, D. (2006). Treatment and posttreatment effects of residential treatment using a re-education model. Behavioral Disorders, 31(3), 312-322. Another study found positive results among adolescents in the program, including among students who had not done well in other programs.Hooper, S. R., Murphy, J., Devaney, A., & Hultman, T. (2000). Ecological outcomes of adolescents in a psychoeducational residential treatment facility. American Journal of Orthopsychiatry, 70(4), 491-500. doi:10.1037/h0087807 Both of these studies noted, however, the difficulty of determining what specific aspects of such a program influence which positive results. In general, the program is judged a viable and effective means of providing help to emotionally disturbed children.

Humanitarian initiatives  As one of the early proponents of collaborative civil-military operations in disaster response, Rasmussen‚Äôs publications include clarifying the optimal role of the military in disaster response, establishing a shared response culture with NGOs for disasters, incorporating survivors in response designs, and leaving beneficial infrastructure like power generation, communications capability, and water purification systems behind. Other specific topics have included: * Using free and open-source tools for mapping and communicationSSTR Pentagon White Paper: http://media.wix.com/ugd/8b7f2d_3ac5eb0fa6be4e379515245a98df810e.pdf * Legislation that allows military humanitarian responders to leave critical response infrastructure behind with the affected population, such as area lighting, broadcast transmitters, and electrical generators, when the humanitarian mission is concluded. * Language in the documents for humanitarian field demonstrations and real-world operations that described humanitarian support competence to be as important as combat operations competence for those charged with humanitarian support responsibilities. That language was later echoed in Section 4.1 of Department of Defense Instruction 3000.05 in November 2005.DoDI 3000.05: http://media.wix.com/ugd/8b7f2d_43b42c89bd7f42efac1abeee4a9a33a6.pdf * The concept of radical inclusion, which Rasmussen has described as a meme borrowed from the Burning Man Arts Festival incorporating ideas from every contributor for evaluation, no matter how unlikely the source. * The concept of demonstrations in humanitarian support researchSSTR Pentagon White Paper: http://media.wix.com/ugd/8b7f2d_ac289756f1c245aa8cb0984ff2f87768.pdf ‚Äì where problems from recent humanitarian responses are collected from those who suffered them, and field trials then are held in similarly austere conditions to allow a range of possible solutions to those problems to be tried without fear of failure and with collaboration an intentional focus. * A brief and very casual 10-20-30 Document 10-20-30 Document: http://media.wix.com/ugd/8b7f2d_9eafcedd8b2a47df93e478b3d97bf8ad.pdf of recommendations for civil-military interaction in disaster support.

It is sometimes called the Ferraris Chronicle, Chronica Ferrariensis or Chronicle of Santa Maria di Ferraria. The chronicle was rediscovered in Bologna in the nineteenth century and published in English translation only in 2017. It is a single undivided text, conceived as a continuation of the Chronica maiora of Bede. It covers events from 781 until 1228, when it abruptly ends. It is most valuable for the Norman period in southern Italy and for events connected with the monastery of Santa Maria. However, its last section, covering the reign of Frederick II, whom the chronicler met, is original and written in the present tense. The author had access to now lost portions of the chronicle of Falco of Benevento, which in its surviving form covers the years 1103‚Äì1140. The Chronica Romanorum thus extends Falco's narrative to the years 1099‚Äì1103 and 1140‚Äì49.

The duo released nine albums with five labels, with two of those albums charted on the US Billboard Christian Albums chart. Background The duo has its origins in Boston, Massachusetts, with the American born who is of Italian ancestry, Angelo Petrucci Jr., and his father a guitarist professionally and mother was a pianist who happened to be employed at a radio station. He began doing shows at 13 years old, when he dad was sick and could no longer perform. Angelo's parents became Christians, when he was a teenager, and they slowly influenced him with Commissioned's \\"Running Back to You\\". During college at Berklee College of Music, Angelo was in a secular band, playing shows at bars, and he did this throughout his college and for about a decade after college. Until Veronica Beth Torres, a Latina, also of Berklee College of Music, had a chance encounter with him at one of his bar performances, and they subsequently became close professionally and personally. She is from New York City's borough The Bronx, but spent some of her life being raised in New Jersey and Puerto Rico. They were doing secular music shows, until their faith strengthened, and they started to pursue a Christian and gospel music recording career. They would eventually marry becoming a husband and wife duo. History The husband and wife duo commenced their recording careers in 1992, with the album, Higher Place, and it was released on September 8, 1992, by A&M; Records. This album was coincidentally their breakthrough release upon the Billboard magazine Christian Albums chart, and it placed at No. 35. They would release eight more albums mostly with Benson Records, but those failed to chart. The duo would release two albums, one each with Zomba Records and Harmony Records, and those did not chart, as well. Angelo & Veronica would release two albums with Verity Records, and Give Your Life charted on the aforementioned chart at No. 39.

Commercial surrogacy, where the surrogate is paid in addition to the coverage of expenses, is not legal. There is a lack of specific legislation and regulations dealing with surrogacy, though the recent increase in surrogacy cases has led to a number of amendments. New Zealand is party to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, and ratified it in April 1993. The primary principle of this Convention is that the best interests of the child are paramount, which must then encompass all surrogacy agreements and regulations. The lack of clear surrogacy legislation in New Zealand has led to many couples engaging in reproductive tourism in order to ensure the surrogacy is successful. This has the potential to significantly impact the human rights of all of the parties involved.M Darnovsky and D Beeson ‚ÄúGlobal Surrogacy Practices‚Äù ISS Working Paper Series, vol 601 1. Domestic surrogacy laws New Zealand has no specific surrogacy legislation. However, there are provisions in other acts that relate to surrogacy arrangements. The Human Assisted Reproductive Technology Act 2004 (‚ÄúHART Act‚Äù) is the primary instrument that deals with the legality of surrogacy. The purpose of the HART Act was to create regulations for cases involving human assisted reproduction, but the lack of specific surrogacy legislation has led to the HART Act encompassing all surrogacy cases within New Zealand. The HART Act provides that surrogacy arrangements are not, of themselves, illegal, but are not enforceable by or against any person.Section 14, Human Assisted Reproductive Technology Act 2004. The HART Act also makes it illegal to give or receive valuable consideration for participating in or arranging surrogacy, but also provides that there may be exceptions to this, being situations where reasonable and necessary expenses are incurred.Section 14, subs (3)-(4), Human Assisted Reproductive Technology Act 2004. The provision that surrogacy arrangements are not enforceable against any person seems to offer little protection for any of the parties involved; none of the parties are able to ensure that the agreement is fulfilled. Any dispute regarding a baby born of surrogacy will be resolved by the Family Court, and the judge will make their decision in the best interests of the child.Section 4, Care of Children Act 2004.Lynley Anderson, Jeanne Snelling and Huia Tomlins-Jahnke The practice of surrogacy in New Zealand. ANZJOG, vol. 53 2, pp. 253‚Äì257. The Guidelines on Surrogacy Arrangements involving Assisted Reproductive Procedures state that the approval of an ethics committee must be obtained before surrogacy agreements are allowed to proceed.Advisory Committee on Assisted Reproductive Technology, \\"Guidelines on Surrogacy Arrangements involving Assisted Reproductive Procedures\\", December 2013. The Ethics Committee on Assisted Reproductive Technology must determine, among other mandatory considerations and requirements, that: # Where there is one intending parent, he or she will be a genetic parent of any resulting child; or # Where there are two intending parents, at least one will be a genetic parent of any resulting child; and # There has been discussion, understanding, and declared intentions between the parties about the day-to-day care, guardianship, and adoption of any resulting child, and any ongoing contact; and # Each party has received independent medical advice; and # Each party has received independent legal advice; and # Each party has received counselling in accord with the current Fertility Services Standard; The Adoption Act 1955 is also relevant to surrogacy, as, under the Act, it is an offence to give or receive any payment or reward in consideration of an adoption or proposed adoption,Section 25, Adoption Act 1955. and a child must be adopted by the genetic or intending parents in order for them to have any legal status in relation to the child.Adoption Act 1955.Re P [1990] NZFLR 385 (FC). The Status of Children Act 1969 further provides that the birth mother, the surrogate, is the child's legal mother irrespective of the genetic origins of the child, and the legal father is the surrogate's partner if he has consented to the surrogacy.Part 2, Status of Children Act 1969. The lack of specific legislation regarding surrogacy arrangements has led to calls for the law to be reformed, specifically reform to allow commercial surrogacy.Debra Wilson ‚ÄúSurrogacy in New Zealand‚Äù [2016] NZLJ 401. International treaties affecting surrogacy New Zealand is bound by the international agreements to which it is party, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Convention on the Rights of the Child provides that ratifying states, of which New Zealand is one, must act in the best interests of the child, and that every child has basic rights, including the right to lifeArticle 6, Convention on the Rights of the Child. and the right to be raised by their parents within a family.Articles 7 and 8, Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides for basic human rights, to which every party in a surrogacy agreement is entitled. While an unborn child does not have the right to life in New Zealand, once the child is born, it is subject to the full rights accorded every person in international law.Right to Life New Zealand Inc v Abortion Supervisory Committee [2012] NZSC 68. Adoption of the child Once a child has been born as a result of a surrogacy agreement the child will then need to be formally adopted by the intended parents. The Adoption Act 1955 governs this and deals with matters such as whose consent is required and who are the legal parents. If a child was born overseas and was brought to New Zealand a temporary visa must be granted to the child and the habitual residence must then decided by the court. If the court concludes that the child is a habitual resident of New Zealand the Adoption Act 1955 applies, however if it concludes that it is the resident of another State then the Adoption (Intercountry) Act 1997 will apply to the situation. The Court of Appeal set a test whereby the habitual residence of a child could be decided upon. Broadly, test is to look at the intentions of the parents and where they intended the child to be residence of.Punter v Secretary for Justice [2004] 2 NZLR 28 (CA) There has been large debate over whether there have been breaches of human rights in surrogacy cases. It is clear that the right against discrimination is a fundamental human right. On the international scale the Universal Declaration of Human Rights creates such protection and at the domestic level the Human Rights Act 1993, in particular section 21. Same-sex couples have, for a significant number of years, been arguing that they should have the right to enter into surrogacy agreements. In 2013 same-sex marriage was legalised in New Zealand due to an amendment to the Marriage Act 1955. The court has the power to make an adoption order ‚Äúon the application of 2 spouses jointly in respect of a child‚Äù under section 3 of the Adoption Act. There has been much debate as to whether same-sex couples fulfil the definition of ‚Äúspouse‚Äù for the purposes of the Adoption Act however since the legalisation of same-sex marriage the courts have now concluded that they do fall within the required definition. This was affirmed by the family court in the case of In the Matter of C (Adoption) [2008] NZFLR 141. The implication of this appears to be that this argument, pertaining to human rights breaches towards same-sex couples in adoption and surrogacy cases, have been nullified as the courts may now make an adoption orders to same-sex couples. International surrogacy arrangements As New Zealand does not allow commercial surrogacy, many New Zealand couples are choosing to enter into international commercial surrogacy arrangements.Ministry for Vulnerable Children, Adopting a Child Born Via Surrogacy. This involves the birth of a child to a surrogate mother in one country, where the genetic or intending parents are from another country. There is no specific legislation in New Zealand that addresses international surrogacy arrangements, thus in all cases where couples arrange for a child to be born overseas and brought back to New Zealand, all New Zealand law will apply.Information Fact Sheet: International Surrogacy, December 2016. These arrangements have significant legal complexities, as well as a high risk of humanitarian problems that may affect the surrogate mother and the child. The Ministry for Vulnerable Children has issued country warnings for jurisdictions that potential parents are advised to avoid, which include: * Cambodia * India * Mexico * Nepal * Thailand Human rights implications The increase in international surrogacy arrangements have led to a number of concerns about the human rights of the child, the surrogate mother and the genetic or intended parents.Katarina Trimmings and Paul Beaumont International Surrogacy Arrangements : Legal Regulation at the International Level (2013, Hart Publishing Limited, Oxford and Portland, Oregon). Right to family life When a child is born via an international surrogacy arrangement, under New Zealand law, the genetic or intending parents will have no legal relationship to the child when it is born; the child's legal parents will be the surrogate mother and her partner. This could arguably breach the right to family life, as while the surrogate mother carried and gave birth to the child, she does not necessarily have a familial link. The HART Act provides that children have the right to information about their biological background and genetic origins; this would suggest that the child has the inherent legal right to know their family, irrespective of the lack of legal rights of the genetic parents.Katarina Trimmings and Paul Beaumont International Surrogacy Arrangements : Legal Regulation at the International Level (2013, Hart Publishing Limited, Oxford and Portland, Oregon) at 300. Right to nationality and citizenship Under the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the ICCPR,Article 24(3), International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. a child is entitled to a nationality from birth.Article 7, Convention on the Rights of the Child. This right is often violated in practice in international surrogacy arrangements, where the relevant nations refuse to recognise a child born through these arrangements as a national, as the laws in each country are often conflicting in relation to the child's legal parentage and nationality.Claire Achmad. \\"International Commercial Surrogacy and Children's Rights: babies, border, responsibilities and rights\\". Paper presented to NZLS CLE Conference: International Adoption and Surrogacy ‚Äì Family Formation in the 21st Century, Wellington, April 2014. If it is not possible to determine a child's nationality, it will not be able to obtain a passport in order to travel and remedy the statelessness and lack of parentage. While the country of the child's birth may recognise the intended or genetic parents as the child's legal parents, New Zealand does not. Children born as a result of an international surrogacy arrangement do not meet the requirements for New Zealand citizenship by descent, and thus the only way that the intended parents may become the child's legal parents is through adoption. Adoption in New Zealand after an international surrogacy arrangement is complex, as New Zealand is signatory and is bound by the Hague Convention on Protection and Co-operation in Respect to Intercountry Adoption, which was brought into New Zealand law by the Adoption (Intercountry) Act 1997.Adoption (Intercountry) Act 1997. These enactments apply ‚Äúwhere a child who is habitually resident in one Contracting State‚Ä¶ has been, is being or is to be moved to another Contracting State‚Äù.Article 2, Hague Convention on Protection and Co-operation in Respect to Intercountry Adoption. While these enactments deal with international adoption and not specifically with international surrogacy, they have been used by the New Zealand courts where the child has already been brought back to New Zealand by the intending parents to go through the adoption process. The Family Court has tended to find that intercountry adoption requirements do not apply in such cases, as the child born in an international surrogacy arrangement is intended to have the same habitual residence as the intended parents, not where the child was born, which is often the surrogate mother's habitual residence, as they often do not have legally identifiable parents in that location.Re Application by KR [2011] NZFLR 429.Debra Wilson ‚ÄúInternational surrogacy and the Adoption (Intercountry) Act: defining habitual residence‚Äù (2016) 8 NZFLJ 217. Further, the Convention on the Rights of the Child states that, in adoptions, the best interests of the child are paramount, especially where there is intercountry adoption.Article 21, Convention on the Rights of the Child. Right to know parents The Convention on the Rights of the Child also provides that a child shall have the right to know and be cared for by its parents, and it shall not be separated from them.Article 9(1), Convention on the Rights of the Child. In surrogacy arrangements, the intended or genetic parents are arguably the child's parents, not the surrogate mother or her partner. Yet, the law surrounding surrogacy fails to recognise this, and instead provides that the legal parents of the child are the surrogate mother and her partner. This could be an issue where the genetic parents of the child are culturally different to that of the surrogate mother, which is often true of international surrogacy arrangements. Rights of the surrogate mother One of the concerns that arises in international surrogacy arrangements is the rights of the surrogate mother, especially when it comes to informed consent and exploitation. It is accepted that in no circumstances should the surrogate mother be forced by the intended parents or anyone else to enter into a surrogacy arrangement.Richard Blauwhoff and Lisette Frohn International Commercial Surrogacy Arrangements: The Interests of the Child as a Concern of Both Human Rights and Private International Law. In all cases, there should be informed consent before the surrogacy arrangement can proceed. Before allowing a child a temporary travel visa to enter New Zealand in order to be adopted, the Ministry of Immigration will consider whether there has been informed consent from the surrogate mother. However, it has been widely questioned whether women in impoverished countries can actually give informed consent to surrogacy arrangements. Women in impoverished countries where international surrogacy arrangements usually take place are often uneducated and poor, and therefore may not be able to fully comprehend all of the implications of surrogacy, and therefore, the idea of a high payment may become a form of coercion or undue influence. The high prices paid by intending or genetic parents may also lead to unfair requirements being placed on the surrogate mother during the pregnancy, which may interfere with her right to privacy and right to self-determination. For example, the intending parents may require that the surrogate mother not travel to certain places or do certain things while she is pregnant, in order to protect the pregnancy and the child.

By the mid-nineteenth century, the kongsi republics controlled most of western Borneo. The three largest kongsi republics were the Lanfang Republic, the Heshun Republic (Fosjoen), and the Santiaogou Federation (Samtiaokioe). Commercial kongsis were common in Chinese diasporic communities throughout the world, but the kongsi republics of Borneo were unique in that they were sovereign states that controlled large swaths of territory. This characteristic distinguishes them from the sultanates of Southeast Asia, which held authority over their subjects, yet did not control the territory where their subjects resided. The kongsi republics competed with the Dutch over the control of Borneo, culminating in three Kongsi Wars in 1822‚Äì24, 1850‚Äì54, and 1884‚Äì85. The Dutch eventually defeated the kongsi republics, bringing their territory under the authority of the Dutch colonial state. Kongsi federations were governed by direct democracy, and were first called \\"republics\\" by nineteenth century authors. However, modern scholars hold different views as to whether they should be regarded as Western-style republics or a completely independent Chinese tradition of democracy. History Kongsis were originally commercial organizations consisting of members that provided capital and shared profits. They were first established in the 18th century as the Chinese emigrated to Southeast Asia. The kongsis emerged with the growth of the Chinese mining industry, and were based on traditional Chinese notions of brotherhood. The majority of kongsis began on a modest scale as partnership systems called huis (). These partnership systems were important economic institutions that existed in China since the emergence of a Song dynasty managerial class in the 12th century. A hui became known as a kongsi once it expanded into a sizable institution that comprised members numbering in the hundreds or thousands. There are scant records of the first Chinese mining communities. W. A. Palm, a Dutch East India Company representative, reports that gold mines had been established in 1779 around Landak, but the ethnicity of its workers is unknown. Competition between kongsis increased as old mining sites were exhausted and miners expanded into new territories, which led larger kongsis to incorporate or consolidate from smaller ones. The Fosjoen Federation was formed in 1776 when fourteen smaller kongsis from around Monterado united into a single federation. The federation's leading members were the Samtiaokioe kongsi, which controlled mining sites to the north of Monterado, and the Thaikong kongsi, which controlled sites to the west and southwest of Monterado. Shortly after the formation of the Fosjoen Federation, Luo Fangbo founded the Lanfang Republic in 1777. Luo emigrated from Guangdong in southern China, accompanied by a group of fellow migrants, and reached Borneo in 1772. Lanfang's early growth is attributed to its commercial ties with the Pontianak Sultanate. The Dutch translation of the Annals of Lanfang implies that Luo Fangbo arrived directly to the port of Pontianak, but he was likely initially involved in the Lanfanghui, an agricultural kongsi that shares the same name as Luo's later kongsi republic. An alternative founding narrative possibly from Malay sources claims that Lanfang originated from a group of smaller kongsis unified by Luo in 1788. The kongsi republics controlled port and inland towns that allowed them to trade goods without the interference of their Dutch or Malay neighbors. The Chinese kongsis were affiliated with the towns of Singkawang, Pemangkat, Bengkayang, and other settlements. These kongsi towns were home to businesses that served the needs of miners and included services such as pharmacies, bakeries, restaurants, opium dens, barber shops, and schools. Kongsi Wars The Kongsi Wars were three separate wars fought between the Dutch and the kongsi federations in 1822‚Äì1824, 1850‚Äì1854, and 1884‚Äì1885. Most of the kongsi republics were dismantled by the Dutch after the Second Kongsi War. The Lanfang Republic was the last of the kongsi federations to survive because they negotiated a deal with the Dutch that allowed them to remain an autonomous state within the Dutch East Indies. Lanfang could still select its own rulers, but the Dutch had the right to approve the federation's leaders. By the mid-nineteenth century, the Dutch sought to limit the authority of the Lanfang Republic. The Third Kongsi war, a failed rebellion by the Chinese against the Dutch in 1884‚Äì1885, brought an end to Lanfang's independence. The territory held by Lanfang was divided between Pontianak, Mempawah, and Landak. The Chinese residents of the former Lanfang Republic were made subjects of Dutch colonial government, but were also expected to pay taxes to local leaders. Government The main body of the kongsi republics was the assembly hall (zongting), an assembly of delegates representing the constituent kongsi mining communities. The assembly hall exercised both executive and legislative functions. In the Heshun Republic, the delegates of the assembly hall were elected every four months. Nineteenth-century commentators wrote favorably of the democratic nature of the kongsi federation. Historians of this period categorized the kongsi federations as republics. The Dutch sinologist Jan Jakob Maria de Groot was in favor of this interpretation, calling the kongsis \\"village republics\\" that partook in the \\"spirit of a democracy.\\" On the republicanism of kongsis, de Groot wrote: > Already the term kongsi itself, or, according to the Hakka dialect, koeng- > sji or kwoeng-sze, indicates perfect republicanism. It means exactly > administration of something which is of collective or common interest. It > has, therefore, also been used by large corporations and commercial firms. > But when used as the term for the political organisations in West Borneo, it > should be interpreted as meaning an organisation for governing the republic. In response to comparisons with Western republicanism, historian Wang Tai Pang has cautioned that \\"such an approach to the history of kongsi is evidently Eurocentric.\\" He concedes that the federations were similar to Western democracies insofar as they involved the election of representatives. However, Wang argues that the uniquely Chinese characteristics of kongsi federations are overlooked when historians only emphasize the connection between kongsis and republicanism in the West. Instead, kongsis should be viewed as authentically Chinese democracies that developed independently from the influence of Western political institutions. Mary Somers Heidhues stresses that the 19th century understanding of the word \\"republic\\" is not identical to the modern interpretation of republicanism.

His exploration work in early 1862 was critical in helping open up the Jordan goldfields.  Biography  Frederick Charles Porter, c. 1865 Frederick Porter (known as 'Fred') was born in 1832 in Queenborough, Kent, England. He migrated to Australia as a child with his family, arriving in Adelaide on the Dumfries in 1839. His father, George Porter, and his uncle, William Porter, were sea captains, who settled in Australia and New Zealand. He first worked as a baker in Hindmarsh. Porter married Eliza Kimpton in 1854, with whom he had seven children. After the death of their second child in 1857, the Porters travelled overland to the Victorian goldfields. The family first appears at the Forest Creek diggings in 1859, before settling at Stratford, north of Sale in Gippsland.S.J. Porter- Sampson, Porter...They Be Thy People, Adelaide, 1988, pp. 115‚Äì116; J. and J. McDonald, Three William McDonalds, Canberra, 2010, pp. 149‚Äì151. By 1862, Porter had developed a good knowledge of the region. When a group of Sale businessmen raised a reward through public subscription of ¬£80 to open up a track from Sale to supply the Jordan goldfields, Porter led three expeditions in the hope of claiming the reward. Before a supply route from Sale was established, provisions for the miners at the Jordan River were carted infrequently from Melbourne through Jamieson and exorbitant prices were being charged. It was feared that the diggings would close down over the winter months, unless a secure and closer supply route could be found. Porter's first expedition included the Prussian-born, Henry Buhrow and was completed in May 1862.Reported in the letter to the reward committee quoted in J.G. Rogers, Jericho on the Jordan: a Gippsland Goldfield History, Moe, 1998, p. 119. In mid-1862 Porter led a second party of seven men to test the value of his track and to bring the first supplies from Sale to the Jordan miners. This party was composed of Fred Porter, Percy Lloyd, William Thomas, Jack 'Nob' Belcher, Louis Armstrong and two unknown men.R. Mackay, Recollections of Early Gippsland Goldfields, Traralgan, 1916, pp. 21‚Äì23; R. Paull, Old Walhalla: Portrait of a Gold Town, Carlton, 1963, p. 16. Note that Fred Porter is misidentified as 'James' Porter. Shortly afterwards, Porter led a third expedition to bring further provisions to the miners and to prove the utility of his route.Gippsland Times, 27 June 1862, p. 2. The three expeditions are discussed in J. McDonald, 'Porter's Track Into the Jordan Goldfields', Ancestor, vol. 32, issue 7 (September 2015), pp. 11‚Äì14. Five claims were made for the reward. Albert Buntine originally said that he was the first to reach the Jordan from Sale, but he subsequently withdrew his claim in favour of Porter and Buhrow. Porter's route, which became known as 'Porter's Track', followed the upper reaches of the Macalister River then across Connor's Plains and along the ridges of the Black River district. Three other tracks took the high ground between the Thomson and Aberfeldy Rivers. These were made by Thomas McEvoy, Archie Campbell and William Anderson. The sources suggest that Porter's Track was the first to be cut and quickly became the one preferred by the miners and carters from Sale travelling to and from the Jordan diggings.J. and J. McDonald, Three William McDonalds, Canberra, 2010, pp. 154‚Äì156. At a meeting held at the Royal Exchange in Sale on 21 July 1862, the reward committee announced that amounts of ¬£20 would be awarded to each of the four claimants and that a further ¬£30 would be given to the man, whose track proved to be the most popular. It was Thomas McEvoy's track, which became the favoured route used to the diggings and won the final reward.J.G. Rogers, Jericho on the Jordan: a Gippsland Goldfield History, Moe, 1998, p. 120. The winter weather had made Porter's Track harder to traverse. As a result, it soon fell out of use, although a modern road through Licola still follows its path. In recognition of the efforts of the men, who cut the early tracks through to the Jordan diggings, William Pearson, a member of the Victorian Parliament, presented a petition of 700 signatures seeking further financial recognition for McEvoy, Porter and Campbell, who had done so much to open up the Gippsland goldfields. But John Steavenson, the Victorian Commissioner of Roads and Bridges was unmoved, despite having awarded around ¬£500 of public moneys in grants to individuals for Melbourne-based routes.J. Adams, Mountain Gold: a History of the Baw Baw and Walhalla Country of the Narracan Shire, Victoria, Morwell, 1980, pp. 34‚Äì35; L. Steenhuis, Donnelly‚Äôs Creek: from Rush to Ruin of a Gippsland Mountain Goldfield, Melbourne, 1990, pp. 29‚Äì30. In late 1863, Fred and Eliza Porter settled near the Fulton's Creek and Donnelly's Creek alluvial goldfields. They purchased an inn, the Halfway House, near present-day Seaton.Butler's General Directory: Wood‚Äôs Point and Gippsland, Melbourne, 1866. It was near here that their nine-year-old son, Jim Porter, discovered a substantial quartz-gold reef, which became known as 'Boy's Reef'. Fred Porter and others formed a company to mine the reef in January 1865.The Argus, 11 January 1865, p. 5. After a long illness, Fred Porter died from pulmonary tuberculosis on 6 January 1869, aged 36. He is buried in a solitary grave on the Aberfeldy River near Walhalla.J.G. Rogers and N. Helyar, Lonely Graves of the Gippsland Goldfields and Greater Gippsland, Moe, 1994, pp. 102‚Äì103. 'Porters Creek' is named after him near the site of his inn.

He was also a theatre and film producer. Early life Chrysler, whose father, Walter Chrysler, founded the Chrysler Corporation in 1925, was born in Oelwein, Iowa. He grew up on the family estate at Kings Point on Long Island, New York. He began collecting art as a fourteen-year-old student at The Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Connecticut. Using $350 that his father had given him as a birthday present, Chrysler purchased a small watercolor landscape that featured an inch-high nude, and he brought the painting to his room at school. His dorm master, believing that it was improper for a young gentleman to display a picture of a nude woman, confiscated the picture and destroyed it. The painting was by Renoir. Chrysler went on to Dartmouth College, where he started an art magazine called Five Arts with a fellow student and future art collector, Nelson Rockefeller. Leaving Dartmouth after his junior year in 1931, Chrysler embarked on a grand tour of Europe and met Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Juan Gris, Henri Matisse, Fernand L√©ger, and other avant-garde artists in Paris. He bought works from each and soon amassed a large collection of modern art. He also bought works by significant American artists such as Charles Burchfield, John Marin, and Thomas Hart Benton. Career In 1934, Chrysler founded the Airtemp division of Chrysler Corporation, which developed the first automotive air-conditioning system. After establishing worldwide distribution, he transferred the patent to the parent company but remained a director. In the following year he became president of the Chrysler Building; he continued in that position until 1953. On April 10, 1942, four months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Chrysler enlisted as a lieutenant junior grade in the U.S. Navy. He served as an avionics officer. Collections and museums When Chrysler's father died in 1940, he left Walter Chrysler Jr. one-quarter of an $8.8 million estate, together with real property, stocks, bonds, and trust funds. In 1956, Chrysler retired fully from business life to devote himself to the arts. By this time, Chrysler had established a large art collection. In addition to his paintings, he had amassed an 8,000-piece collection of glass with holdings of Art Nouveau and 19th-century American art glass, perhaps inspired by Chrysler's acquaintance with his Long Island neighbor Louis Comfort Tiffany. Chrysler assisted in the development of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, serving as the first chairman of its library committee and contributing resources on Dadaism and Surrealism. His works were also exhibited at the Detroit Institute of Arts and the Mellon Library. Although the visual arts were Chrysler's principal interest, he was also active in theatre and filmmaking. He produced the Broadway plays The Strong Art Lonely and New Faces of 1952, the latter helping to launch the careers of Eartha Kitt and Mel Brooks. Chrysler also produced the film The Joe Louis Story in 1953. Controversy Chrysler purchased a disused church in Provincetown, Massachusetts in 1958 for use as the Chrysler Art Museum of Provincetown. In 1962, Chrysler's art collection from his Provincetown museum was displayed at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, Ontario. The Art Dealers Association of America asserted that 90 of the 187 exhibited paintings were fakes. That same year, at Picasso's 80th birthday exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, the artist himself was shown photographs of six of his works owned by Chrysler, and he wrote faux (\\"false\\") across two of them. Chrysler never pressed a case against the dealers who had sold the works to him, but when his collection was eventually transferred to the Chrysler Museum of Art in Norfolk, Virginia, the suspect works were removed. It has been alleged that Chrysler had a reputation for acquiring art works but not paying for them. In 1971, the museum relocated to Norfolk after municipal authorities refused Chrysler's request for tax abatements, although it has been suggested he was asked to leave Provincetown by authorities due to persistent homosexual soliciting. Personal life Chrysler married Marguerite Sykes in New York City on April 29, 1938. The marriage was unhappy and short lived, and a divorce was granted on December 4, 1939; a contributing factor may have been Chrysler's homosexuality. While stationed in Norfolk during World War II, Chrysler met Jean Esther Outland (born September 15, 1921), and they married in 1945. They lived on the North Wales estate near Warrenton, Virginia, where Mr. Chrysler bred racehorses and Mrs. Chrysler bred champion long-hair Chihuahuas. The couple had no children, and Mrs. Chrysler predeceased her husband in 1982. Chrysler maintained a residence in New York and a home in Key West, but he died near his museum in Norfolk after a long struggle with cancer. Upon Chrysler's death, the Chrysler Museum received three-quarters of the Chrysler Family Trust.

Ama L'Uomo Tuo Ama L'Uomo Tuo (Always Love Your Man) is an 18:52 minute long documentary centred on DeVito's grandmother's life. Produced in 1975, two years after her grandfather, Liborio Logiudice (LeJudas) died, the work explores Adeline's turbulent marriage, recounting her experiences of violence, a forced illegal abortion, and abuse. In the video, Adeline shares her views on marriage and housewifery, expressing that it is '\\"the most important job, the most important thing in life,\\" she says. \\"My husband trained me, Cara. Fix the table in the morning, so when people comes, you have nothing to do but greet the guests. Fifty years with the same man! Prepare! Wash! Cook!\\"' Produced in a time when gendered violence first gained mainstream awareness, Ama L'Uomo Tuo is in dialogue with the practices of consciousness raising groups, an early feminist movement.

Factors include differences in beliefs, attitudes, and treatment options that impact diverse populations throughout the world.  Breast cancer and spirituality  A patient's spirituality is so important that the National Health Society in Scotland requires boards to have a spiritual care policy for patients. This is often overlooked by health care providers. In studies it shows there is a positive correlation with religion or spirituality and women with breast cancer. Many African-American women have a positive correlation with religion and how it adds to their quality of life. They often have faith in their religious practices, belief in God, support system of family and friends to find meaning and purpose.Swinton, J., V., B., Ingram, S., & Heys, S. (2011). Moving inwards, moving outwards, moving upwards: the role of spirituality during the early stages of breast cancer. European Journal of Cancer Care, 20, 640-652. In Chile, women's spirituality is important and showed it through prayer, perceived dependence on God to intercede and guide them through this time in their life. They also had social support from their faith communities. Muslim women view their diagnoses as a will of God. They were also active in getting the medical treatment they needed. These women's quality of life was linked with their spiritual meaning. Women often use their religion or spirituality to help them frame their diagnoses in a new way that provides meaning and purpose. Health care providers can benefit by knowing the role spirituality plays in these women's life, there will be a better awareness of the supporting networks these women need to help cope with their diagnoses. Providers will also be more sensitive to how they make meaning of their cancer, and this will help providers recognize and respond to their patient's spiritual experiences. This will open new doors for a greater empathic care.  Screening among women with intellectual disabilities  Despite the fact that governments have passed policies and an outreach to provide equal access to healthcare and screenings open, women who are intellectually disabled have lower rates of receiving mammography than the general population. A study was done to find out reasons why women were still not taking advantage of the screenings that are now available to them.Truesdale-Kennedy, M., Taggart, L., & McIlfatrick, S. (2011). Breast cancer knowledge among women with intellectual disabilities and their experiences of receiving breast mammography. Journal of Advanced Nursing, 67(6), 1294-1304. A group of women in Ireland had recently received a mammography; they were interviewed to see what they knew about breast cancer, signs or symptoms, if they had read any material prior to their screening or how they could help prevent breast cancer from occurring. The sample of women had little knowledge in any of these areas. The women explained that their experience was positive but prior to going into their screening they had feelings of fear, anxiety and stress because they did not know what to expect. These factors of a low level of awareness and the fear of the unknown are barriers that prevent women from going to get screenings . There are 3 things that healthcare providers can do to break down these barriers. # Women need to have access to material and resources to inform them about the importance of screenings and basic facts about breast cancer. # When women go to get a mammography it is important for providers to explain the procedure and what it means. It can't be assumed that women already know. # Nurses and staff need to provide emotional support to women before, during and after the procedure. This will help relieve any embarrassment, stress, fear or anxiety that they might feel.  Treatment options by region   China  Breast cancer is a particularly good market to highlight the differences in the treatment practices between Western countries and China. This is despite the fact that the incidence of breast cancer in China was approximately 215,600 patients in 2011, which compares closely to the incidence in the United States of America. Even with the high incidence, there has been a lack of emphasis on diagnosis and detection of breast cancer in its early stages. In Western countries, there are many resources available for patient education and awareness of breast cancer detection as well as many therapeutic options. In China, the majority of breast cancer patients are diagnosed with Stage III/IV disease, which contrasts with Western countries, where patients are more likely to be diagnosed in the early stages. Proper diagnosis is not the only limiting factor. Patients with well-defined disease (HER2- positive) struggle with the ability to gain access to traditional chemotherapeutic options that are considered the standard of care for their Western counterparts.Neesha Suvarna, PhD Consultant, Kantar Health. (November 2013) Information and Insight intoBreast Cancer in China. http://www.kantarhealth.com/docs/white- papers/information-and-insight-into-breast-cancer-in-china.pdf The other issue most often seen in emerging markets is lack of treatment options as patients relapse following their first line of therapy. In China, only about 40% of metastatic breast cancer patients who receive first-line therapy will go on to receive a second line of therapy. The situation gets dire in third- line, where only one-quarter of patients will receive third-line therapy. Fourth- and fifth-line therapies are virtually non-existent in China. These reported frequencies of later lines of chemotherapy among Chinese patients are significantly lower than those in Japan and the United States, where 80% of patients continue to second-line and 65% of those patients continue to third- line. The main reasons for low use of later-line treatments are the lack of good therapeutic options and the financial burden of more expensive drugs. As their disease progresses, patients are more likely to turn to traditional Chinese medicine.  Middle East  The Middle East tends to have younger sufferers of breast cancer in comparison to the rest of the world. In Lebanon, for example, 50 percent of breast cancer patients are below the age of 50 - this compares to 25 percent in the United States and Europe. Breast cancer rates in the Middle East are actually lower than in the western world. Most recent statistics show that in 2012, there were 99,000 cases of breast cancer reported across the Middle East, North Africa, and parts of Central Asia combined, whereas the European Union had 367,000 cases, and the US, 1,677,000. Nevertheless, mortality rates in the Arab world are much higher. According to the World Health Organization, this is because the region lacks a culture of regular breast cancer screening and therefore, early detection of the disease. The result is that many cases of breast cancer are presented to medical professionals at a late, and usually critical, stage. Remarkably in Jordan, 70 percent of breast cancer cases are first presented at advanced stages. While both the Lebanese and Jordanian governments have programs that fund aspects of cancer care, the expensive cost that develops over the long course of treatment is another concern for women. Lebanon's Ministry of Health will pay for up to 85 percent of treatment costs, but this still leaves families having to cover the remainder, which can be incredibly high. Moreover, regional instability and an influx of displaced people into Lebanon and Jordan have put immense pressure on the countries' healthcare systems. Despite these challenges, many say that awareness campaigns are having a positive impact in the region. Every October, for example, Jordan and Lebanon run workshops to teach women about the importance of self- and clinical examinations.Jessica Sarhan. (05 Sep 2014) Health, US & Canada, Jordan, Lebanon, United States. Women urged to fight breast cancer stigma. http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/07/lebanon-women-breast-cancer- stigma-2014718134537878942.html  South Africa  Considering that breast cancer is the number one cancer among women in South Africa, its early detection may have reduced mortality in recent years. According to the Cancer Association of South Africa (CASA), the lifetime risk is 1:33. However, South Africa does not have an official breast cancer screening program. So how did the first Siemens Mammomat Inspiration prime mammography system for clinical use find its way to a city in South Africa? This may not seem so far-fetched once you have witnessed the multi-disciplinary approach to breast imaging followed by Capital Radiology in Pretoria. There, a range of specialists, radiologists, radiographers, surgeons, radiation and medical oncologists work together with one aim: breast health. The private practice is situated at the Little Company of Mary Hospital (LCM) in Groenkloof, a suburb of Pretoria. The hospital first opened its doors in 1957 and is currently one of 63 healthcare facilities across the country owned by the Life HealthCare network. Capital Radiology has a state-of-the-art suite in the Women's Health Department of LCM, and also provides general radiology services to the hospital and its patients. Every month literally hundreds of women walk through the practice's doors to be screened for breast cancer. Patients are sometimes even referred by general practitioners in other provinces of South Africa. As a private radiology practice, Capital Radiology is usually reimbursed by insurance and out-of-pocket payments. Apart from the newest mammography system, they also have the first Mammomat Inspiration and the first ACUSON S2000TM ABVS (Automated Breast Volume Scanner) in Africa. These are complemented by a 1.5-tesla MAGNETOM Symphony magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system. Mammography can detect small, early-stage tumors that cannot be felt by touch. In particular, it detects micro-calcifications that may indicate tissue changes and a preliminary form of cancer. While mammography is still the standard diagnostic tool for detecting breast cancer in its early stages, the radiographers at Capital Radiology also use ultrasound, which is especially helpful in assessing dense breast tissue. If a mammography or ultrasound exam shows a suspected cancer, biopsies are carried out under either stereotactic mammography guidance or ultrasound guidance. A multidisciplinary team of surgeons, oncologists, and pathologists then decide about the treatment path, possibly involving other modalities such as MRI, computed tomography, and, in some cases PET-CT, in this process.Susan Pur√©n.

Bhutto engaged in substantive discussions with Soviet leaders in Moscow, including meeting with Chairman Alexei Kosygin and Secretary-General Leonid Brezhnev. Even before being elected on a socialist platform in 1971, Bhutto had spoken of the necessity of independent foreign policy and stronger relations with the Soviet Union, which had been fractured during the direct war with India and the Indo-Soviet Treaty.. The meeting was marked as a reconciliation between the states and as a restoration of industrial co-operation. It also signaled a wider shift towards an independent foreign policy, in particular to reduce Pakistan's dependence on the United States. Held from 2 March till 5 March 1972, the meeting also strengthened trade between the two states. Trade was increased from 36.2 million rubles (–†—É–±–ª—å) to 92.3 million rubles.. The repercussions of Bhutto's visit were vast, including the ‚Ç®.4.5 billion worth of Pakistan Steel Mills established in Karachi, the Guddo Thermal Power Plant, and Pakistan's official departure from the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) and the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO).. In 1974, Bhutto again visited Moscow as part of a goodwill mission, aimed at strengthening ties.. That visit yielded mixed results: the Pakistan Steel Mills were established and inaugurated in 1985; however, the closer ties with China, difficulties with India and Afghanistan, and the discovery of Soviet arms negatively impacted relations between Pakistan and Soviet Union. Relations between the two countries would quickly sour after Bhutto was deposed and executed by the pro-American General Zia ul Haq, who aligned Pakistan with the US in support of the Afghan Mujahideen to resist the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979‚Äì1988.

The video runs for twelve minutes and five seconds and materially visualizes the deflected energy of the electronic signal. The video switches between two sources throughout, which creates a flickering effect. The imagery is based on the deflection of electronic signals, and a colorizer is used to add color variation. In the video, a circular form materializes on the screen and presents a division between inner and outer. A pulsation between the two is sustained throughout. The Signal The Vasulkas were among the first video artists to experiment with the signal, and the potential to delay its feedback or multiply waveforms to create new imagery. Their approach directly intervened with the directional movement of the signal. They wanted to transform line configurations by shifting the direction of the signal's constant horizontal and vertical flow. This interrupted the simultaneous feedback of image and sound signal and delivered deviated image from the raster image, a new three-dimensional shape or form. Noisefields focuses on the deconstruction of the video signal, as it visualizes the signal's immaterial energy. The deconstruction of signal in the video produces an image wherein the diverse variation of form relies on the variability and modulation of frequency detected by the signal. Audio-Visuality The video camera, opposed to the film camera, offered video artists the ability to record and play back sound and image simultaneously. Although the video camera records images, it is more closely tied to the process of \\"sound transmission, recording, and production.\\" There is a reciprocal relationship between audio and video, as sound signals can be \\"translated into image signals\\", and visual content is generated by sound. Spielmann writes in video \\"one can see what one hears and hear what one sees.\\" Because of the close affinity between sound and image, many artists saw the video image as moving music. Emerging from a background in music, Steina wanted to apply the same principles of music composition to video making. In her artist note \\"My Love Affair with Art: Video and Installation Work\\" she writes that she begins \\"with a melody\\" and then adds \\"harmonic lines.\\" Noisefields explores the relationship between sound and image in video, as there exits a mutuality between the audio/video signal. Using video processor machines, the Vasulkas were able to further unite sound and sight as the energy content modulates the sound and image. Video Processor Like many other experimental video artists of the time, the Vasulkas used the Rutt/Etra Video Synthesizer to make Noisefields. The machine was developed in 1973 by Louise Rutt, Steve Rutt, and Bill Etra, and allowed video artists to more wholly unite sound and image. The machine was of particular interest to artists who wanted to deconstruct and analyze the video signal, in order to exert greater control over the modulation of electronic signals. The Scan Processor lifts \\"the brighter parts of the image...in their temporal progression, according to the voltage, causing the horizontal lines to deflect vertically and sculptural forms to be generated.\\" Using the processor, the Vasulkas were able to create abstract images from the modulated video signal. In the production of this video, a circular form was recorded and then extraneous electronic information was keyed into the circle. The video therefore visualizes and makes audible the movement and energy of the electronic signal. The result is a \\"noisy image-sound impression.\\" Colorizer Video, opposed to film uses an additive process for colorization. In Noisefields a colorizer is used to add variety and complexity to the saturation of video noise. Pulsation The pulsation between an inner and outer field, the circle and rectangular is mirrored by the rapid alternations between the two video sources, which maintains a rate of about sixty cycles per second. The switching occurs between two video sources, producing the two fields, background and circle. The two fields alternate between pure color and pure noise. The alternation creates a complex pulsation between circle and ground. Perception As the video temporally unfolds, complex perceptual illusions are triggered through repetition, alternation and flicker. The flickering video image, which references the perceptual explorations of Op Art and \\"flicker\\" film, produces the illusion of the video as a series of constructed frames. As the video image is constantly in motion, unlike the filmic image, a video \\"frame\\" never appears on the screen in its entirety and the viewer cannot grasp the image as a whole. To receive the video images in full, the viewer must pause the video using VCR features or the frames must be completed in our \\"perceptual-cognitive\\" system. As the Vasulkas were interested in exploring beyond the \\"theoretical ‚Äòframe‚Äô of video‚Ä¶to get rid of the supremacy of the human eye, the inherited modes of perception, and to reach an alternative\\" Noisefields explores the neuropsychological effects of the video image and promotes a perceptual model based on \\"interactive circuitry\\". The flicker is intensified to underscore the perceptual stimuli, and the viewer is prompted to actively participate in perceiving the shifting field. The image therefore is partially a creation of the viewers mental activity, and viewer and video become reciprocally engaged.

It is named after the Recuay District, in the Recuay Province, in the Ancash Region of Peru. Territory This culture developed in the Callej√≥n de Huaylas valley, and its artistic style is also known as \\"Huaylas.\\" The Recuay area is very close to the earlier Chav√≠n culture at the centre of Chavin de Huantar that lies just to the west. Recuay people originally occupied much of the territory of the Chav√≠n and were influenced by them. Chav√≠n influences are seen in architecture (for instance, in the use of underground galleries) and in stonework, such as in sculpture and steles. Their ceramics were influenced by the Moche cultura. While the Peruvian coastal cultures of that time, such as the Moche, the Lima, and the Nasca, are much better known, the high sierra also saw the emergence of powerful cultural polities. These were the Cajamarca in the north, the Huarpa in central highlands, and the Pucar√° in the Titicaca highlands.George F. Lau, Andean Expressions: Art and Archaeology of the Recuay Culture. University of Iowa Press, 2011 p13 The relationship between the Recuay and the Moche state in the north must have been rather tense because they shared borders and competed for the same water sources. There is evidence of considerable warfare, and of the warrior-oriented society as reflected in their fortified buildings and iconography. In fact, the Recuay are associated with the earliest emergence of fortified centres and towns in the Peruvian Andes.George F. Lau, Andean Expressions: Art and Archaeology of the Recuay Culture. University of Iowa Press, 2011 p11 Recuay peoples built rectangular-shaped tombs with multiple rooms and levels. The culture especially flourished in the Callej√≥n de Huaylas region, and along the Mara√±√≥n River. It also spread to the valleys of the Santa, Casma and Huarmey rivers. To the north, it reached the area of Pashash, in Pallasca. Willkawayin was one of their important settlements. Ceramics A vessel with musicians, 21.5 cm high; Recuay area, Peru, 100 BCE ‚Äì 300 CE, collection of the Kloster Allerheiligen, Schaffhausen, Switzerland Recuay culture features a distinctive pottery with decoration in three colors: black, red, and white. Recuay potters sculptured small figures of humans, jaguars, llamas, and other animals, which they attached to the vessel. Their pottery is related to Vir√∫ cultural pottery (also known as Gallinazo). The Viru Valley lies just north of the Recuay area. Like the Cajamarca, Recuay ceramics used kaolin clay, which involved highly complex work; the ceramics acquired a white color after firing. One of the central figures in Recuay art is the so-called \\"moon animal,\\" a foxlike or feline animal with a long, toothy snout and head crest.The Recuay Culture Tampere MuseumRecuay art metmuseum.org  Other art forms  Recuay textiles were of very high quality, and used similar decorative motifs as the ceramics. Recuay stone carvings called Aija are found throughout the Peruvian Highlands. They are related to those of the Pucar√° and Tiwanaku cultures. Pashash culture Cabana. Belongs to the Pashash culture, around 500 CE Pashash culture (500 ‚Äì 1000 CE) is seen as a later development of Recuay culture. It developed in the northern Sierra de Ancash (Cabana) region. Its remains are found in Chacas, a town located in the east-central region of Ancash, in Cabana, Peru, also in Ancash, and in other places. Metallurgy was also advanced at this time. At Pashash, very fine Recuay style jewelry of gilt arsenic bronze were excavated, as well as fine pottery; the dates are between AD 300 and 600.Terence Grieder, The Art and Archaeology of Pashash.

Having dealt a heavy defeat on the Swedish army at the Battle of N√∂rdlingen in September, the armies of the Emperor, Spain and the Catholic League overran much of the Swedish-held southern Germany. At Wilstt√§tt, the armies of the Emperor and the Catholic League, led by Duke Charles IV of Lorraine and general Johann von Werth, defeated a Swedish force assembled by the Germans the Rhingrave of Salm-Kyrburg-M√∂rchingen, the Duke of W√ºrttemberg and the Margrave of Baden-Durlach. The battle lasted for three hours and ended with 2,000 Swedish soldiers dead on the battlefield and a bigger number in the rout. The Rheingrave Otto saved himself inside Strasbourg. Background Portrait of Charles IV, Duke of Lorraine, by an unknown author. After the battle of N√∂rdlingen, which saw the destruction of the main Swedish field army at Germany and the capture of its commander, Gustav Horn, the Catholic armies gathered for the battle divided again and advanced northwards to the lands occupied by the Swedish or held by their German allies. While the bulk of the Imperial and Spanish armies advanced upon Franconia, where Duke Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar, commander of the German Protestant forces, had withdrawn to defend the province following his defeat, Duke Charles IV of Lorraine invaded the duchy of W√ºrttemberg, a wealthy country where his troops could recover from the battle, and the commander of the German Catholic League, Johann von Werth, invaded and took control of Swabia. Aiming to expel the remaining Swedish forces from the Rhineland, Maximilian I of Bavaria asked Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor, for some reinforcements. Thus, Ferdinand sent Charles of Lorraine with an army corps to Alsace, where the Swedish, in order to prevent the Imperials from taking control of the region, were handing to France, under the terms of the Treaty of Paris, the fortresses and cities that they controlled there. Meanwhile, Johann von Werth advanced on the Black Forest with the Catholic League's army and forced Duke Eberhard III of W√ºrttemberg to leave the siege of Willingen, chasing later his retreating forces to the gates of Strasbourg. While Werth went to join forces with Duke Charles, the Duke of W√ºrttemberg did the same with the governor of the Swedish Alsace, the Rhingrave Otto, who was collecting the Swedish forces at the Free Imperial city of Offenburg, on the eastern bank of the Rhine, opposed to Strasbourg. Battle The Rheingrave Otto Louis of Salm, by Cornelis Danckaerts, 1642. Peace Palace Library. On 27 September both armies moved to meet each other at the battlefield near the village of Willst√§tt, between Offenburg and the Rhine river. The Catholics mustered 6 regiments of cavalry, 2 of croats and 300 musketeers, in all about 3,000 cavalry and 1,500 infantry, while the Swedish, having collected their forces from Swabia and the Bodensee, numbered 6,000 or 7,000 men, including the troops of the Duke of W√ºrttemberg and the Margrave of Baden-Durlach, asides of French reinforcements that were expected to arrive very soon to the battlefield under colonel Batilly, the lieutenant of the Duke of Rohan ‚Äìsent by Louis XIII of France to assist the Swedish‚Äì, but which arrived late to see any action. The Rhine river with Strasbourg in distance during the 17th century, by Wenceslaus Hollar. The battle lasted for three hours, until Charles of Lorraine led an attack that broke the regiment of the Rheingrave, the best of the Swedish army, and the entire Protestant contingent was put on flight. About 2,000 Swedish soldiers were killed on the battlefield, and many others died during the chase or were drowned in the Rhine while attempting to escape. A group of 700 Swedish soldiers entrenched themselves inside a farmstead and perished amidst the flames after the building was set on fire by Catholic soldiers. The Imperial and Leaguist forces took 6 cannons and 4 flags. The Rheingrave was about to cross the Kinzig, a stream which runs next to Willst√§tt and flows into the Rhine at Kehl, when he ran into some Bavarian cuirassiers of the regiment of Keller, who mistook him for a Catholic officer. Though they realized the mistake when the Rheingrave jumped into the water with his horse and opened fire on him, he only received a light wound. The Rheingrave managed to reach Kehl, where he entrenched his remaining men, and sent his family to Strasbourg across the town's bridge over the Rhine. On arriving there, Charles of Lorraine took the entrenchments by assault and the Rheingrave barely escaped. However, the bridge collapsed shortly after because of the excessive burden of his fleeing soldiers, and many of them were drowned. Charles of Lorraine wrote a letter to the city council of Strasbourg, asking them to open the gates of the city, but the request was denied. The Rheingrave, still controlling the west bank of the Rhine, promptly retreated to Seltz, while the Catholics moved to Rastatt. As result of the battle, the village of Willst√§tt was burned.Pfaff, Fridrich: Alemannia: Zeitschrift f√ºr sprache, litteratur und volkskunde des Elsasses und Oberrheins. Freiburg im Breisgau: Ernst Fehsenfeld, 1907, p. 193. Aftermath Sweden and the Heilbronn League quickly removed their garrisons in the Rhineland after the battle and handed to France the cities of Colmar, Schlestadt and Basel. The Elector of Saxony opened talks with Ferdinand II, but the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel and the Duke of L√ºneburg still fielded troops against the Emperor and were in the surroundings of Frankfurt am Main. Meanwhile, the Imperial armies were between the rivers Neckar and Main, where they took Heilbronn on 27 September, the same day that the battle of Willst√§tt was fought. Since the battle of N√∂rdlingen, the Catholics had expelled the Swedish and their German allies from Bavaria, Swabia ‚Äìexcept from Ulm and Augsburg, where they still held out but blockaded by the Duke of Bavaria‚Äì, W√ºrttemberg, and most of Franconia; in words of Diego Aedo y Gallart, secretary of the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria: \\"expelling him [the Swedish] from the roots of the Alps\\".

The antibody targets the T cell activation marker LAG-3, which is mainly expressed in inflamed tissues. In GSK's March 2015 Product development pipeline document the antibody is listed under 'Immuno- inflammation' candidates. GSK2831781 entered a Phase I clinical trial in psoriasis early in 2015.  History  GSK2831781 originated from a chimeric monoclonal antibody to LAG-3 developed in 2008 by the French biotechnology company Immutep. That company had been built around drugs targeting LAG-3 and was associated with Fr√©d√©ric Triebel, an immunologist generally regarded as a leading authority on LAG-3. In discovering the Immutep antibody, Triebel worked with two researchers from the University of Nantes, where there was an INSERM unit focused on transplantation immunology called ITUN (Institut de Transplantation Urologie Nephrologie). Triebel et al. codenamed their initial murine antibody A9H12, which became IMP731 after it had been chimerized with a human IgG1 Fc region in order to have antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) as well as complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) properties. GSK licensed the rights to develop anti-LAG-3 antibodies for autoimmune disease from Immutep in December 2010 in a total deal package worth ¬£64 million. GSK subsequently developed GSK2831781, its own depleting anti-LAG-3 antibody based on IMP731, around 2013 or 2014. GSK's antibody was humanized and was afucosylated for higher ADCC. Prima BioMed, the biotech company which acquired Immutep in 2014, announced a 'single digit' million dollar milestone related to GSK2831781's commencement of the Phase I in January 2015.http://www.primabiomed.com.au/investor/pm/2015/1292.php  Mechanism of action  GSK2831781 works to treat autoimmune disease by targeting LAG-3+ activated T cells that are known to accumulate at the diseased organ site and destroying them through ADCC and CDC, thereby depleting them from the body. Because GSK2831781 is addressing the cause of the disease by depleting the few activated auto-aggressive T cells and not just the symptoms of the disease like inflammation (taken care of by current treatments like anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies or corticosteroids) it is thought to be part of the next wave of treatments in the field of autoimmune diseases.  In vivo evidence  In December 2007 Triebel and his Nantes colleagues showed, in a paper in the journal Transplantation, that depleting anti-LAG-3 antibodies could stop alloreactive effector T cells from forming in rats that had had heart transplants. In February 2011 the Nantes group and Triebel presented evidence, this time online in Clinical and Experimental Immunology (May 2011 in print), that a single injection of IMP731 can prevent, for many months, Th1-driven skin inflammation in the tuberculin-induced DTH model in primates. This evidence suggested to GSK the potential of psoriasis as an initial proof-of- concept indication for GSK2831781.  Phase I, 2015  GSK2831781's first clinical trial is a Phase I in both psoriasis patients and healthy individuals. The trial is expected to recruit around 63 subjects, half of whom will be healthy and half of whom will have plaque psoriasis. The healthy subjects will be given BCG in order to track DTH and subsequent response to antibody treatment. The study will be randomized, double blind, placebo- controlled, and single ascending dose. As well as evaluating safety and tolerability the study will investigate mechanisms of action and clinical endpoints. It is planned to complete by Feb 2018. The contract research organization working with GSK is PAREXEL, which will conduct the study at its site at Northwick Park Hospital in London. This trial started recruitment in early 2015.

It is one of 12 of the Commune by the Great Wall, collection of buildings in the Yanshan Mountains overlooking the Badaling section of the Great Wall of China. The home was completed in 2002, and is built primarily using a special bamboo version of Laminated Veneer Lumber developed specifically for this project. Concept To take advantage of the project‚Äôs spacious site, Ban envisioned a single story home with a square footprint and square courtyard. The home is oriented in a North-Northeasterly direction and is horizontally integrated into the site. The concept‚Äôs low profile drew its influences from traditional Chinese Vernacular Architecture. It was very important that the structure fit into the context of Chinese tradition as well as the regional and immediate environment it was situated in. Ban decided to approach the project as he did with his Furniture House projects and incorporate much of the home‚Äôs furniture into the walls themselves. Materiality Due to the exceptionally low quality of Chinese timber producers at the time, Ban had trouble finding a suitable material for the building. He eventually settled on a newly developed plywood called Laminated Bamboo Plywood, a form of LVL. All beams, floors, interior and exterior finishes were done in Bamboo to ensure consistency of material throughout the home. Bamboo Furniture House was also one of the first buildings that successfully utilized bamboo as a structural material, something that only Sim√≥n V√©lez had done before. Ban was incredibly interested in learning the construction methods and styles of Chinese Architecture, of which he was unfamiliar. The project had a limited budget and was constructed in a remote mountain location. Due to the remoteness of the site, Ban had the structure pre-fabricated and his client, Redstone Industries, carried out the construction administration for him.

Ginsberg began shooting the day that Richard, an old friend of Carel's, came by to talk about the wedding. This initial session was spontaneous, and in this instance Ginsberg says that in using video media, he was able to capture this footage impulsively, the video came about by chance. Though the footage is centered on the event of the wedding, the camera's insertion into the lives of Carel and Ferd before the event means that much of the footage anticipates the wedding self- consciously.Phillips, Glenn. \\"Arthur Ginsberg and Video Free America.\\" California Video: Artists and Histories.

Though the footage is cut to highlight specific moments and events, most of the footage is edited straightforwardly so as to not interrupt the narrative flow, the limited editing testament to Ginsberg's belief that with videotape any editing at all is \\"sapping its strength as a real-time medium.\\" Synopsis  The Continuing Story of Carol and Ferd takes on a loose long-form narrative, with two main subjects in a circle of friends, primarily shot in San Francisco. Carel Rowe, a filmmaker and erotic film actress and Ferd Eggan, a queer junkie, seek to be married, in part for the \\"media show\\" of their marriage and in part, a genuine desire to express their love for one another through the legal union of marriage. The footage features several others in their social group, notably Richard, a previous paramour of Carel's, who appears in an attempt to convince Carel and Ferd to not get married, as well as in the actual marriage scene. The video also features several unnamed friends, often present and sometimes addressed during the filming. Both Carel and Ferd also mention many others in their circle, including Ferd's alleged lovers, a source of contention between the two. On camera, the two kiss, interrogate one another, banter, argue, and have sex. The camera documents their intimacy as well as interrupts it, as they address the camera directly and answer questions asked by Ginsberg, behind the camera. After a fight scene, Ginsberg asks an unnamed friend in the shot whether the couple is fighting because the camera is on, to which the friend replies; ‚ÄúOh I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre doing it because the camera is on, but the camera's affecting them.\\" In the WNET broadcast the two refer to the camera as a catalyst for action, and that their behavior in the presence of the camera was performance of only certain realities. The wedding itself is shot with more jump cuts, interviewing guests and featuring multiple close-up shots of details of the ceremony. The ceremony is a combination of a Jewish service and a media show, referencing Marshall Mcluhan's the medium is the message. The wedding footage concludes with loud and obviously staged shots of the consummation of the marriage. In this footage the camera men are present and visible, the camera's whirring is recorded, and the camera men shout directions at the couple.The Continuing Story of Carel and Ferd. Dir.

Theoretically, it is possible to make such a material, and there are claims this material was already made, including claims from MIT and Harvard.  Theory  In theory, photons, the particles that form electromagnetic radiation including light, could be attracted in a nonlinear medium. In test, a laser beam fired into an extremely cold cloud of rubidium slowed down the photons and made them act as a single entity.  Fiction  Solid light appears in many video game franchises, including Halo, Portal, Destiny, Mass Effect and Overwatch. Probably the most prominent examples of solid light are the holograms and holodecks from Star Trek: The Next Generation and its multiple spin-offs and sequel series. Ranging from city-sized holographic environments and realistic, edible, nutritious food, to entire holographic people, with observed-sentience and individual personalities. The widespread use of holograms and replicated materials (replicators and holograms seem to share a base technology in the Star Trek universe) makes it the most widely known and advanced form of solid light represented in fiction.https://www.startrek.com/article/meet-the-man- behind-the-holodeck-part-1 In \\"Red Dwarf\\" the character Rimmer is a hologram who obtains a hard light drive, allowing him to touch and feel while being almost indestructible.

It draws from several disciplines from cinema therapy, expressive therapy, narrative therapy, art therapy, digital storytelling, and phototherapy which requires a collaboration to integrate the many dynamic aspects of art and medicine. Joshua Lee Cohen Ph.D., author and co-editor of Video and Filmmaking as Psychotherapy: Research and Practice (published by Routledge in 2015), helped to establish a collaborative effort in forming film/video-based therapy. This form of therapy is about making films with clients, as opposed to cinema therapy, which involves watching films. Dr. Cohen has utilized watching films and mindfulness in his work. Dr. Cohen has been cited in Tuval-Mashiach and Patton's clinical trial and participated in peer reviewed research on the use of video narrative in cancer research. It is not trademarked for advertising or financial purposes but intended to protect the sanctity of the license for mental health professionals and the use of the word \\"therapy\\" when used in conjunction with film/video in the United States. (Other countries may have different policies) Film/video-based therapy is used in both research and practice. It has several names. Each name has a slightly different purpose for each population.  Therapeutic filmmaking  This term was coined by J. Lauren Johnson, Ph.D. the co-editor of the academic monograph/book titled Video and Filmmaking as Psychotherapy:Research and Practice. To learn more about Therapeutic Filmmaking, one can read about Johnson and Alderson's pilot study on the subject or Johnson's use of Therapeutic Filmmaking withf first nations populations. The term is also used for both veterans and active duty servicemen and women with Benjamin Patton's and Rivka Tuval -Mashiach's work work. The work is left intentionally ambiguous, so that the population may not be intimidated by the stigma of a diagnosis. The lack of pressure to call it \\"therapy\\" opens up a space to allow for new and old healthy memories to form.Video and Filmmaking as Psychotherapy: Research and Practice Video remix therapy Video art therapy is used primarily in private practice with art therapists, drama therapists, and other expressive art therapists. \\"Stories play a significant role in how we feel about and interact with the world. Narrative therapy and expressive arts therapy are major influences on the creation of expressive remix therapy, a new form of engagement with clients. This article is an exposition of this particular mental health modality. The use of digital media art in therapy in group settings will be discussed, and examples of how to use digital media art and technology in group therapy sessions are provided. The intention of this article is to promote a renewed appreciation for stories as the backdrop for all narrative work; it also seeks to inspire people to look at the practice of mental health differently, particularly the tools used to positively impact clients.\\"Jamerson, J. (2013). Expressive Remix Therapy: Using Digital Media Art in Therapeutic Group Sessions With Children and Adolescents. Creat Nurs Creative Nursing, 182-188.  Digital storytelling  Digital storytelling is also used in collaboration with film/video-based therapy and is used primarily for education. Storytelling is an indigenous and ancient way for people to relate to one another and to understand the mysteries of life. Using modern technology, artists have used film and video for expressing ancient and modern images and sounds.  History of Film/Video-Based Therapy and Other Therapies, Similar to This Genre of Healing  This method of using film as a healing tool is not a new concept. However, with the advent of modern technology and filmmaking, digital storytelling, virtual reality, and therapeutic filmmaking as well as film/video-based therapy are growing in popularity and the research is growing. It is a collaboration between clinicians and practitioners in art therapy, expressive therapy, phototherapy, psychotherapy, digital storytelling and other mental health and academic fields of study and practice. Currently art therapists, expressive therapists, psychologists, masters level practitioners, psychiatrists, anthropologists, filmmakers, academics, and other clinicians have contributed to this collaborative effort in building a global community to help further define this field. The use of film and video in, or as, therapy, has a decades-long history in practice. Early work in this field included the post-World War II use of experimental, non-narrative films to calm veterans suffering from shell shock. The 1970's saw boys in a group creating short films together to foster group cohesion, mastery skills, and better communication. With the advent of portable video equipment in the 1970's, female artists began turning the camera on themselves, making themselves the object of their own gaze. There is a dearth of literature on the theory and practice of using film/video production as therapy and the multidisciplinary practitioners who support its use. Copious literature exists discussing the use of related media in a therapeutic context, such as photography, writing, drawing, music, and drama, but this body of literature is virtually vacant of film/video as a therapeutic medium. Despite the fact that there is little writing in this area, numerous practitioners from around North America and Europe are quietly working with film/video-based therapy ‚Äì often independently, as the community of practitioners is still quite small and geographically scattered. This is an attempt to bridge that gap and bring people together as a global community and new research and practices are emerging. Virtual Reality Film/video-based therapy can also be used with virtual reality and specifically designed to treat bipolar disorder, phobias, psychosis, etc. Film/Video-based therapy combines somatic techniques, depth psychology, Virtual Reality, and digital storytelling, which is different from the cognitive/exposure therapy being used today in most forms of VR therapy which favors exposure therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy over depth approaches and narrative. Although some exceptions exist as depth approaches are gaining more acceptance after proving evidence based approaches to depth work as in Allan Schore's work at UCLA. Using Technology to Improve Health Through Narrative One theory as to why film/video-based therapy works with trauma, may be due to the reprocessing that happens during the final moments of editing, similar to EMDR. In the moment of making a film, one can use somatic experiencing which was designed to regulate the autonomic nervous system.Somatic Experience, Felt Sense Video Art Therapy Telling one's story can help to reprocess old memories while avoiding triggers or reprocessing them in a new way using the technology. There is some research in this area yet, but it is still in development. Culture Film/video-based therapy is also about building a therapeutic relationship with a person and a wider support group or community. When dealing with any technology, whether virtual reality or digital storytelling,Storycenter.org, yourdigitalstorytellingproject.com the theory remains the same, film/video- based therapy is about using technology for human purposes and building relationships to others and nature. Technology is just the language for understanding, appreciating, and honoring our nature.The Dalai Lama on technology References * Mental health ","title":"Film/video-based therapy"},{"id":"46546072","text":"Leonard Christopher \\"Swede\\" Hanson (March 29, 1900 - October 1969) was a college football player and wrestler and later coach at Cornell University.

At present the PNA provides education for officer-cadets, commissioned officers and civilian students at first and second cycles of study (undergraduate and graduate), as well as doctoral studies. It also offers opportunities for professional development at specialized courses and postgraduate programs. In accordance with international agreements the PNA trains officers for naval forces of countries in Europe, North Africa, the Middle and Far East. International exchange significantly contributes to the rise in qualifications of the PNA staff. It also allows the students to attend lectures given by best specialists from leading scientific centers of the world.  History   Temporary Officers' Training Corps (1921)  After the foundation of Polish Naval Forces on November 28 of 1918 by the time's Chief of State J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski the formation of its military branch was started. One of the main goals was a formation of a training structure, due to the lack of cadets. The plan was at first to start a Maritime School and a training division which was completed in 1920. There was no need for this type of training structure until the Polish-Soviet war of 1920, since all of the naval forces were being outsourced from the occupying regime's government. After Poland gained its autonomy, general Kazimierz Porƒôbski decided to form first institution that temporarily provided courses for new officers (pol. Tymczasowe Kursy Instruktorskie dla Oficer√≥w (abbr. TIK)) in Toru≈Ñ, Poland on March 20 of 1921. It was an 18-month-long course that was preparing officers of land forces for a service on board of battleships. Under the supervision of LCDR Adam Mohuczy in total the course was completed by 39 officers.  Naval Officers' School (1922)  Under the jurisdiction of rear admiral Kazimierz Porƒôbski on November 6 of 1922 the Naval Officers' School (pol. Oficerska Szko≈Ça Marynarki Wojennej (abbr. OSMW)) was formed again in Toru≈Ñ. This time the school consisted of 1 faculty and was meant to provide new cadets to become maritime officers. The training period consisted of 2 years that later got extended to 3 years. During the courses cadets were gaining experience on board of such battleships as OORP \\"Komendant Pi≈Çsudski\\" and \\"Genera≈Ç Haller\\". Captains of Naval Officer's School * Capt.

SPMW)) with majorly reorganized structure within the institution itself. At first it consisted of a formation of two separate faculties: Maritime and Technical. Practical courses were provided on board of battleships ORP \\"Iskra\\" and ORP \\"Wilia\\" respectively. Later, in 1935, there was created an additional faculty on Administration directed towards maritime administration. In 1938 the school was moved from Toru≈Ñ to a nearby town of Bydgoszcz. Courses under the new structure were completed by 158 officers, 173 maritime graduates, 23 technical graduates and 12 administrative graduates. At the start of the Second World War in 1939 cadets and officers from Naval Cadets' School were taking an active part in county's defense, mainly in land formations. A month earlier, on August 24, some of the cadets, together with new candidates, who were receiving temporary training in Oksywie, Gdynia, were sent back to Bydgoszcz.

Jerzy ≈öwirski Naval Cadets' School was revived, this time in Great Britain. The main reason why the revival was possible was the completion of the courses reached by remaining cadets and their successful transition from Poland to Great Britain. Later on new cadets were being also recruited among N.C.O.s and seamen. The training program did not change much, except now the practical part of the courses was held mostly on battleships of the Royal Navy. On September 17 of 1943 the Chief of the Polish Navy Capt. Jerzy ≈öwirski created a new Reserve Naval Cadets' School (pol. Szko≈Ça PodchorƒÖ≈ºych Rezerwy Marynarki Wojennej (abbr. SRRMW)), which shared its management with the Naval Cadets' School. The goal of that was to create a new cadre for Polish Navy that would be formed after the Second World War. The exact location of Naval Cadets' School was on board of a Polish battleship ORP \\"Gdynia\\" and in a British harbor of Plymouth but in 1943 together with the new Reserve Naval Cadets' School it was moved to Bickleigh and Okehampton. On November 25 of 1946 both of the schools got cancelled under the jurisdiction of the Chief of the Polish Navy Capt. Jerzy ≈öwirski. From 1939 to 1946 from Naval Cadets' School graduated: 53 naval second lieutenants from the Maritime faculty, 40 reserve naval second lieutenants from the Maritime faculty, 16 naval second lieutenants from the Technical faculty, 2 reserve naval second lieutenants from the Technical faculty, 5 naval second lieutenants from the Naval Officers' faculty and 9 reserve naval second lieutenants from the Naval Officers' faculty.

Naval Officers' School (1946)  On January 18 of 1946 a Polish People's Army's commander-in-chief marshal Micha≈Ç Rola-≈ªymierski ordered a foundation of a military maritime training institution. Capt. Adam Mohuczy followed the order and instructed to form a Naval Officers' School (pol. Oficerska Szko≈Ça Marynarki Wojennej (abbr. OSMW)) in Gdynia, Poland. It was planned to be a temporary solution before the proper training institution for the maritime officers would be formed. After the establishment of the Naval College the Naval Officers' School closed the applications for its new cadets and later on got closed. First year of cadets completed the faculty in a 3-year system while in following years a 4-year bachelor system was implemented. Candidates who applied were required to have completed 4 years of high school with an order of honoring seamen, naval N.C.Os and land units' officers first. The Deck Faculty consisted of following cycles: general, political, vessel maneuver, sea strategies, sea knowledge, communication and radiolocation, sea practice. The Technical Faculty shared the general, political and sea practice subjects with addition of generally technical, electrical, electrotechnical and engine ones. At the end there were held exams and students were required to pass a thesis which was giving them specializations: Deck on the Deck Faculty and Steam, Internal Combustion or Electrical on the Technical Faculty. First practical classes were held on board of civil frigate \\"Dar Pomorza\\", later battleship ORP \\"Iskra\\" in 1948 and ORP \\"Zetempowiec\\" in 1951 were added.

WSMW) which was an institution of higher education functioning like an academy. In 1956 the school's name was amended with the addition of the honorifc \\"Heroes of Westerplatte\\". Initially the Naval College consisted of 4 faculties: navigation and sea communication, sea weaponry, technical and private. In 1956 the private faculty was closed and in 1957 other faculties got reorganized into Maritime Department and Technical Department. The study programme for navigation and mechanical subjects was subtracted from similar courses held on other civilian universities, enriched with additional subjects on sea weaponry and army-oriented matter. Those who graduated were getting the title of engineers. Since 1955 students were also able to attend special officer and leadership courses to become a certificated officer. In 1959 first master's degree courses for Technical Department were open. In 1968 a Naval School of Ensigns (pol. Szko≈Ça ChorƒÖ≈ºych Marynarki Wojennej) was founded and later the Naval College was providing doctor's degree programme for navigation and ship mechanics. Naval College had graduated approximately 2000 officers and 800 ensigns. Commanders of Naval College * Capt. Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski (June 11, 1955 ‚Äì October 18, 1958). * Capt.

Akademia Marynarki Wojennej, abbr. AMW). This way the name of the institution has gotten relevant with its internal structure. At the end of the 90's its military department was introduced with master's degree courses and new civil faculties. They consisted of mechanical faculty, international relations faculty and pedagogical faculty. In the year of 2000 the Leadership Institute was developed into lately the Department of Naval Strategy Management and then into the Department of Naval Operational Art and Naval Military Tactics which was enabled to honor its graduates with titles on military science. In 2002 the Naval School of Ensigns got closed. Next step was forming the Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences which in 2006 was transformed into a separate department. Until the year of 2006 the number of academy graduates reached approximately 600 officers and 300 ensigns. From the year of 2015 the Academy has been proceeding on internationalizing and has welcomed students and tutors from such countries as Qatar and Kuwait and from 2016 Saudi Arabia. During the cadence of Defense Minister Antoni Macierewicz the position of sessional instructor was made vacant from admiral Ryszard ≈Åukasik, vice admiral Henryk So≈Çkiewicz and rear admiral Zbigniew Bade≈Ñski.

He served as a Justice of the Supreme Court of Nigeria. Early life Samuel Obakayode Eso was born on September 18, 1925 at Ilesa, a city in what was then the Nigeria Protectorate. Both of his parents, Emmanuel Dada and Rebecca Omotola Eso, belonged to prominent chieftaincy families amongst the Ijeshas. Emmanuel's father, Chief Ifaturoti, held the Eso chieftaincy title, and it was from this title that their family's surname was derived.J.F.

Shooting Servin, an off-duty police officer, drove his car to Douglas Park on the West Side of Chicago after calling the police to make a noise complaint. He then approached a group of four individuals who had been partying in the park and had some form of verbal altercation with them. Reports are unclear as to whether Servin was calm and polite or rude and aggressive. One of the victims, Antonio Cross, accused Servin of attempting to buy drugs from the group, to which Cross allegedly told Servin to get his \\"crackhead ass\\" out of there. Servin fired on the group, hitting Rekia Boyd in the head, and Antonio Cross in the hand. Initially the Chicago police department claimed that Servin had discharged his weapon after Cross had approached him with a gun. The Boyd family quickly responded that the object was in fact a cell phone. No weapon was ever recovered from the scene. Aftermath In November 2013, Servin was charged with involuntary manslaughter, but was cleared of all charges on April 20, 2015, by Judge Dennis J. Porter in a rare directed verdict. Porter's reasoning was that since the shooting was intentional, Servin could not be charged with recklessness. \\"It is intentional and the crime, if any there be, is first-degree murder,\\" said Porter in his ruling. Attorney Sam Adam, Jr., accused state prosecutor Anita Alvarez with deliberately undercharging Servin knowing that the charges would be dropped, in order to curry favor with the police department. Servin claimed he fired because someone in the group was holding a gun, but it was actually only a cellphone. Witnesses said that Servin appeared drunk at the time of the incident. In November 2015, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and police superintendent Garry McCarthy both suggested that Dante Servin should be fired by the Chicago Police Board.Hernandez, Jade (November 24, 2015). \\"Emanuel: Officer who fatally shot Rekia Boyd 'does not deserve to wear police star'\\". ABC 7 Chicago. The city paid $4.5 million to Boyd's family. Servin resigned on May 17, 2016, two days before the departmental hearing which was to decide whether he should be fired. Protests While there was some public protest of the ruling, the community response was overall more muted compared to protests against the acquittals of other police officers involved in the deaths of African Americans, such as those who killed Michael Brown, Eric Garner, and Freddie Gray. Some commentators pointed to \\"the sexism of those ostensibly committed to black liberation\\" that \\"can leave us blind to the taste of brutality that black women are getting from the police.\\" The Black Lives Matter movement has protested the deaths of black girls and women at the hands of police, including Boyd's.

Its headquarters was the Waldvogteiamt.  Location and topography  Hotzenwald landscape near Ibach The region of Hotzenwald is not precisely defined in the records. In a narrower sense the Hotzenwald is the southernmost region of the Southern Black Forest, bounded in the west roughly by the Wehra, in the north approximately by the upper reaches of the Alb near St. Blasien, in the east by the hill ridge between Alb and Schl√ºcht and in the south by the High Rhine and Klettgau. This definition of the Hotzenwald more or less covers the same area as the territory of the old County of Hauenstein. In a wider sense, other regions may be counted as part of the Hotzenwald that were linked to St. Blaise Abbey or the County of Hauenstein, both of which were historically important in the Southern Black Forest. These additional areas include, for example, the parish of Gersbach (Schopfheim), which was first mentioned in 1166 by the gift of a church to St Blaise Abbey and which lies immediately northwest of the Wehra. Others include the regions in the northwest as far as the middle and upper reaches of the Wiese and in the east to the hill ridge between Schl√ºcht and Steina. Whichever definition is used, the region mainly covers the central and high areas of the Southern Black Forest. It climbs rapidly from the level of the High Rhine (about ) up to heights of 500 to over across the majority of the area. The region drops from the summits of the Southern Black Forest in the north to the High Rhine in the south and is characterised by sunny plateaux and high valleys. The rivers in the Hotzenwald generally form high valleys in their upper reaches and cut deeply into the basement of the Black Forest rocks in their lower reaches. They follow the downslope of the Southern Black Forest from north to south before emptying into the Rhine as right-hand tributaries. The main rivers in the Hotzenwald region, from west to east, are the Wiese, Wehra, Murg, Alb and Schl√ºcht. The parishes in the heart of the region are Rickenbach, Herrischried, Dachsberg and G√∂rwihl.  Geology   Basement  The oldest rocks occurring in the Hotzenwald are gneisses and migmatites, which were formed in the Palaeozoic era. The largest part of the Hotzenwald is the granite countryside between Bernau and Bad S√§ckingen. The granite rocks that occur here are, according to research, up to 335 million years old.c.f. Helge K√∂rner: Der Hotzenwald, a.a.O., pp. 29ff. Other elements of the terrain are granite porphyry and lamprophyre. Near Laufenburg, the Kleiner Laufen rapids broke through the basement; today they are impounded.  Platform  In the eastern and southeastern Hotzenwald platform rocks cover the basement. According to field research in the area of Waldshut/Dogern this layer of bunter sandstone is an average of 15 metres thick and divided into three elements: the upper stratum of 8 metre thick R√∂t clays; beneath it a roughly 5 metre thick sandstone layer mixed with carnelian (the Carnelian horizon); and, at the bottom, above the basement, a roughly 2.5-metre-thick stratum of M√ºhl sandstone.  Glaciers  During the W√ºrm glaciation the Alb valley glacier covered the Hotzenwald from the north to just before G√∂rwihl. The extent of the Black Forest Glacier of the Ri√ü glaciation is no longer precisely known today, but it appears to have extended from the north as well as far as Hottingen. The finds from the Alpine gravels of the Ri√ü ice age indicate that the glacier flowed from the Alps to a point north of Waldshut-Tiengen. A confluence of the Black Forest Glacier and the Alpine Glacier is highly unlikely to have taken place.  Vegetation  Blumenbinse (Scheuchzeria palustris) After the ice age the Hotzenwald region experienced a tundra climate. There is evidence of beech being the dominant species of tree up to 600 B. C.. In addition, grain pollen, which dates to a similar period, is an indication of the first settlement of the Hotzenwald. Around 1,000 A. D. spruce superseded beech as the predominant tree species. Glockenheide (Erica tetralix) The raised bogs (Hochmoore) and transitional bogs (√úbergangsmoore) especially in the Ibach/Dachsberg area, as a relic of the ice age, are home to a rich variety of species otherwise rare in the Black Forest such as bog-rosemary, mud sedge and fewflower sedge, rannoch-rush, alpine bulrush, white beak-sedge or purple coltsfoot. The European Arctic starflower has a strong presence in the Hotzenwald, which is also the only place in the whole of South Germany where the cross-leaved heath occurs naturally.vgl. Helge K√∂rner: Der Hotzenwald, a.a.O., pp. 1ff. Especially in the first half of the 20th century, the forestry industry‚Äôs attempts at drainage drastically reduced the number of bogs. As a result, several bogs in the Hotzenwald were declared as nature reserves; in 1998 there were 10 of them. In addition, attempts have been made to regenerated some of the old bogs. The forests in the Ibach/Dachsberg area and the Upper Forest (Oberwald) consist mainly of firs, beech and spruce. In the poorly drained hollows these are interrupted by bogs or spruce woods. In the second half of the 20th century several areas of highland pasture were turned into forests. Likewise during this period, reforestation of the steep heads of the valleys, mountainsides and unused valley grasslands was begun. By contrast, the terraced slopes of the outer forests were largely cleared. On the high pastures the winged greenweed plays an important role.

History Henry Simpson, who may have been born in Hull, arrived at Kangaroo Island 1836 as second officer to Captain Martin of the 105 ton two-masted schooner , then captain of the Orwell 1842, the South Australia Company's schooner Victoria in 1943, and by 1844 captain of the John Pirie. He was later made captain of the barque Lord Hobart. According to A. T. Saunders he was known by the nickname \\"Cocky\\". He was appointed wharfinger at the Old Port, then transferred to the New Port. He started acting as a shipping agent around 1850, for a time involved with millers Phillips and P. A. Horn, and with Henry Giles (partnership dissolved January 1853). He left South Australia for the goldfields of Victoria mid-1853 and when he returned two years later, having already dealt in coal from Newcastle, started in a small way as a coal merchant, anticipating the rapid increase in coal-fuelled steam power. He leased the Queen's wharf and store, and the No. 4 bond store, and founded the Black Diamond line of colliers, and by 1866 had a fleet of 14 colliers, all sailing ships. Fairfield (1864, wrecked 1874), Koh-i-noor, Julie Heyn (barque wrecked off Gerringong May 1865), Kadina (originally Jeanie B. Payne) 1865‚Äì1879, Moonta 1865, Frowning Beauty, Bosphorus (barque) 1866, Wallaroo, Meander (1866‚Äì1875), Contest (wrecked 1874), Verulam 1869, Exonia. By 1871 the Julie Heyn, Moonta and Frowning Beauty were no longer counted among their number. Lanercost, Saxon, Stag (1872), J. L. Hall, Athena, Planter (Plantea?) and Ardencraig were acquired later. Simpson was curiously slow in adopting steam power for his little fleet of ships, introducing Ridge Park in 1879, Birksgate in 1881, and Tenterden in 1883. The Tenterden was sold in 1884. The naming of these steamer was significant: \\"Ridge Park\\" was the name of Simpson's residence in Glen Osmond; \\"Tenterden\\" was for a time the family home in Woodville, later the home of his son James. \\"Birksgate\\" was a residence owned by his business partner Thomas Elder. The Black Diamond line did more than just carry coal from Newcastle to Adelaide and Wallaroo; the Koh-i-noor brought some forty camels and their \\"Afghan\\" attendants from Karachi for Thomas Elder's Umbaratana station in 1868. The Koh-i-noor was chartered by the South Australian Government to service the Northern Territory expedition in 1869. Simpson was no cost-cutter ‚Äì he kept his ships in top condition and employed some of the smartest skippers, paying generous bonuses when fast times were achieved. Simpson was for a time owner of the Albert Hotel, Alberton, since demolished. The company Simpson & Sons continued after Henry's death and owned the collier Otago, remembered as being in 1887 under the command of Joseph Conrad when her master Capt. Snadden died in the Gulf of Siam. Recognition A stained glass window in his memory, depicting the unloading of a ship, was installed in St Margaret's Church, Woodville, in 1936. The \\"Black Diamond Corner\\" (intersection of St. Vincent Street and Commercial Road, Port Adelaide) was named for the Black Diamond Hotel,The hotel, owned by W. Knapman (1831‚Äì1908), which dated from 1879, was renamed \\"Central Hotel\\" in 1884. which was named for Simpson's Black Diamond shipping line.

Niigata is his hometown, which is located on the Japan Sea. At Tama University of Fine Arts Shimizu is a professor working in the Moving Images and Performing Arts Department. Life Shimizu Kunio grew up in the Niigata Prefecture. His father was a policeman. As a student at Waseda University located in Tokyo Shimizu wrote The Signatory in 1958 as well as Tomorrow I‚Äôll Put Flowers There in 1959. These plays were produced in the year 1960 by Seihai, a professional theatre company. After he finished studying at Waseda University Shimizu worked at Iwanami Film Productions, which is a Tokyo firm. There he wrote scenarios for documentaries as well as public relations films. In 1965 he went on to be an independent playwright and left the company. Somewhere around 1968 Yukio Ninagawa asked Shimizu to write a play for him to direct. At the time, Ninagawa was an actor for Seihai. Shimizu wrote Such a Serious Frivolity for Ninagawa to produce, however, even though Ninagawa wanted to produce the play the script got rejected. Due to this incident Ninagawa and some other people who worked with him left Seihai. They made a new company that was called the Modern People‚Äôs Theater. Around this time there was a lot of social disruption. Young people across Japan from what was called the New Left started political argumentative meetings. Therefore, Shimizu wrote some plays in order to bring up a sense of the view of the people whose political reform demands were not being met. Shimizu Kunio married Matsumoto Noriko who was an actress. Together they founded a group of entertainers called the Winter Tree Company (Mokut≈çsha). He also set up the Modern Man‚Äôs Theater (Gendaijin gekij≈ç) along with Ninagawa. Plays The plays he has written include The Dressing Room (Gakuya), Such a Serious Frivolity (Shinj≈ç afururu keihakusa), Tango at the End of Winter (Tango fugu no owari ni), When We Go Down That Great Unfeeling River (Bokura ga hij≈ç no taiga o kudaru toki), and An Older Sister, Burning Like a Flame (Hi no y≈ç ni samishii ane ga ita). Shimizu Kunio went to Waseda University and started writing plays to be performed in the 1960s. His play When We Go Down That Great Unfeeling River (Bokura ga hij≈ç no taiga o kudaro tiki) received the Kishida Prize for Drama for being the best play in the year 1974. Some of the topics Shimizu's plays deal with include reality and illusion, the present and the past, and also memories of the past. His plays incorporate the past as well as the present. Furthermore, memory plays an important role in his plays as there is always the question of which character's memory is correct. These techniques are displayed in the play The Dressing Room two ghosts of two actresses are looking at two actresses who are still living. The plot of this play is based on the memories of these characters. One theme that is in many of his plays has to do with the city versus the country. Another theme that is present in some of Shimizu's plays is memories having power. Also, a longing and an affection for the past are themes present in his work. In many of Shimizu‚Äôs plays the dramatic tension centers between siblings and their parents. For example, even though his plays are ironic or comedic, a death often occurs in the end. In the play When We Go Down That Great Unfeeling River (Bokura ga hij≈ç no taiga o kudaru toki) the main characters are a man, his oldest son, and his younger son. The play is set inside a public restroom. Overall, the play has to do with politics, however, other topics are also mentioned. In the play An Older Sister, Burning Like a Flame (Hi no yo ni samishii ane ga ita) the actor in the play has mental problems due to weird powers that a person who says she is his older sister is putting on him. Due to this he strangles his wife when it has been suggested that a brother and sister have had a child together. Shimizu seems to use the relationships among family members as an important point in his plays. Sometimes these relationships are harmful to his characters. Another thing that sometimes happens in Shimizu‚Äôs plays are the personalities change from one character to a different character throughout the play. Another important theme that comes up in Shimizu‚Äôs plays is the country versus the city. Shimizu sees the countryside as unsafe. The countryside represents the things that people run away from in their lives. The Dressing Room (Gakuya) is a play that takes place backstage. In the play there are four actresses who are getting ready for a production of The Seagull, a play by Anton Chekhov. However, during the play it is learned that everything is not just what it seems. The play has theme of memory not being perfect and memory lasting beyond the body and into death. Style of Japanese plays in the 1960s Shimizu Kunio wrote in the time period of the 1960s. Other Japanese playwrights who also wrote during this time period include Sh≈´ji Terayama, J≈´r≈ç Kara, K≈çb≈ç Abe, Minoru Betsuyaku, Sh≈çgo ≈åta and Ren Sait≈ç. Like Shimizu these playwrights had memories of the war. The plays of the 1960s in Japan took on a style different style from shingeki, while shingeki strayed away from the traditional theatre of Japan and instead was inspired by the theatre of Europe, the 1960s style of angura, an avant-garde theatre movement, aspired to have a Japanese style. However, even though a Japanese style was a focus, European plays still influenced the plays of this time period. The Japanese theatre of the 1960s also was influenced by the Japanese styles of n≈ç and kabuki. The body is a focus of plays in this time period. There was an emphasis on the live performance over the text. Influences There are works of Shimizu that have become postwar theatre classics. He wrote that K≈çb≈ç Abe has influenced him as well as being an example to him. Shimizu has recurring themes in his plays such as a frustrated search for a personal identity and madness. Furthermore, another common component of Shimizu‚Äôs plays are having the central drama come from siblings and their parents. Shimizu also makes use of other literature, which usually comes from drama as well as poetry in the West. He uses these works in order to make his scenes more powerful. For example, An Older Sister, Burning Like a Flame (y≈ç ni samishii ane ga ita) used the works of Othello by Shakespeare. Shimizu also appears to have a similar style as Anton Chekhov, a Russian playwright, in terms of how Chekhov uses a mixture of light humor as well as an intense feeling of wanting something. However, there are some differences between the works of Chekhov and Shimizu. For example, the characters of Chekhov are not capable of bringing out the energy and sense they need to change their lives. The characters of Shimizu, however, express a lot of energy. Also, in the works of Chekhov, usually the main character is alive in the end while in Shimizu‚Äôs works the main character usually does not end up living. Shimizu has written many plays as the collection of his plays add up to forty-three. Another one of Shimizu‚Äôs plays called When we go Down that Heartless River (Bokura ga Hij√¥ no Taiga o Kudaro Toki) was first performed in the year 1972 is an example of an extended metaphor. In the year 1978 his play An Older Sister, Burning like a Flame(y≈ç ni samishii ane ga ita) was written. The play is about the main character that has to deal with their past. In the play a main character is an actor who becomes tiered of being in Othello, a play by Shakespeare. The main character then returns to his homeland that he has not been to since he was little. A motif that occurs in Shimizu‚Äôs plays include the contrast between the city and the country. This is also present in Chekhov‚Äôs work. For Shimizu the country is dangerous and the country is made into a metaphor to represent the things that humans run from in their lives and the things that humans are unable to deal with. Another one of Shimizu‚Äôs plays The Dressing Room is a little over an hour long. Shimizu uses a collage in order to indirectly convey his thoughts. This type of collage done in drama was created by Tadashi Suzuki. However, the whole play is not a collage. The Dressing Room is a play about an actress and three other actresses who died without ever getting fame. The three dead actresses are in the dressing room and wait so that they can be characters in a play that they will never be asked to take on. Shimizu‚Äôs play Tango at the End of Winter goes back to the motifs and techniques that were used when he first began writing plays. In this play Sei tries to get freedom by performance however, the character ends up stuck in a movie theatre that is falling apart. The character chooses a ghost to be his partner. He dances a tango with a ghost, the ghost of his past. The other people cannot see who he is dancing with while he is able to see a peacock which is something he finds optimal, which he has chased ever since he was young. Being born in the country has also had an influence on Shimizu's work. Having lived both in the country and the city he is able to compare both ways of life. His hometown in the country has been an influence on his hometown memories have given him inspiration in his writing.
