The fire continued for 65 days. Initially Neil Adams Fire Fighters(NAF, Houston) was hired to bring fire under control. After ONGC disagreed with their strategy NAF left and it was finally brought under control on 15 March 1995 by International Well Control. The blowout did not cause any casualties, but the drilling rig was destroyed. Damages to the drilling rig were estimated at Rs 9.2 crore crore as well as about Rs 7 crore of damage to equipment at the well site area. Evacuation 7 villages within the 2 kilometers radius of the rig, approximately 1,500 people were evacuated immediately by APSRTC buses. More people fled in panic from the nearby villages.

His output included a wide repertoire of genre subjects, however he is best known for his erotic sculptures of young women. Early life Bruno Zach was born in Zhytomyr, Ukraine, on 6 May 1891. He emigrated to Austria as a young man and studied at the Vienna Academy under sculptors Hans Bitterlich (1860‚Äì1949) and Josef M√ºllner (1879‚Äì1968).B√∂heimer: Stra√üen & Gassen. S. 65, 106. His styles ranged from art deco, art nouveau, sporting, to orientalism. His oeuvre would generally be considered decorative if not for his success in producing erotic sculpture. Career Zach became a prolific creator of sculptures featuring tall, athletic, dominating women in bronze and ivory, the combination of the two in art casting sometimes being referred to as ‚Äúchryselephantine‚Äù. He most often signed as \\"B. Zach\\" or \\"Bruno Zach\\", however a number of his pieces were signed with his pseudonyms, being \\"Prof. Tuch\\", \\"Professor Tuch\\" or \\"K. Salat\\".Simpson Galleries: Auction 22.02.2015, Lot 272 His erotica sculptures usually featured sexy, dreamy, scantily clad mistresses in stockings, garters, and high heels. One of his better known sculptures is the sado-masochistic The Riding Crop. Original period castings of this sculpture have sold for as much as $151,849, one such sale having taken place at the Bonhams auction house in Knightsbridge on 23 November 2011. According to Bonhams' director of decorative arts, Mark Oliver, \\"the demand for his work just grows and grows\\". One of Zach's more controversial sculptures, created circa 1930, was his extremely erotic piece entitled The Hugger. The sculpture depicts a woman hugging a larger-than-life penis. Zach frequently portrayed the seedy side of nightlife in Berlin with many of his sculptures which often featured prostitutes. His bronze sculptures were generally fired and coated with chemical patinas in mid-brown colors but were sometimes cold painted or polychromed. His used ivory, sparingly, and it was generally well carved. Zach's work was edited by several firms, including Argentor-Werke (Vienna), Broma Companie, S. Altmann and Company, and Franz Bergmann.

Through a series of intermittent flashbacks, messages he wrote to himself, and clues such as sketches and photographs, Adam gradually pieces together the recent past. Flashbacks to the 1980s show Russian scientist Dr. Yuri Yegorov performing experiments on restrained subjects in an attempt to connect their brains to a hive mind consciousness. The experiments succeed, but patients mutate, break free from their restraints, and cause chaos as they kill researchers in the lab. More recent flashbacks show Dr. Baker performing brain surgery on a little girl named Kayla who inexplicably recites a complex mathematical equation before dying during the operation. Based on what he saw with Kayla, Dr. Baker seeks funding for research into shared memories. A mysterious man in a suit sets up Dr. Baker in a lab with Dr. Yegorov‚Äôs research as a starting point. Dr. Yegorov eventually comes to warn Dr. Baker that their research is dangerous and potentially evil. When Baker refuses to back down, Yegorov holds Baker at gunpoint while his men steal the hive virus samples used on test subjects. Yegorov‚Äôs team escapes with the materials on a hijacked plane. Adam remembers being a counselor at Camp Yellow Jacket with his friend Clark. Even though Adam has a history of sleeping around with women at the camp, including a secret affair with Clark‚Äôs girlfriend Jess, Adam falls for a counselor named Katie and the two of them gradually foster a romance. Yegorov‚Äôs plane crashes in a nearby forest. Adam, Clark, Katie, and Jess investigate the crash site only to be attacked by a pilot infected with the hive virus. Clark crashes their vehicle when the quartet tries to escape. Everyone makes it back to camp on foot, but not before the pilot vomits a black substance that infects Jess. Adam and Katie leave Clark with Jess in the infirmary while they go to radio for help. Adam then leaves Katie alone in a vehicle while he goes on ahead to discover all the camp kids infected. Through hive mind voices, Jess reveals to Clark her affair with Adam. Clark exits the infirmary to hunt down Adam but Clark finds Katie and ends up infecting her. Infected Katie returns to the infirmary and tells Adam he should escape. Jess attacks Adam and he is forced to kill her to save himself. Adam locks Katie in a separate room to protect her but she infects him with the black substance before he locks the door. Adam leaves messages and clues for himself to explain the situation for the time when the infection inevitably possesses him. He then succumbs to the virus and collapses. Adam preemptively uses his affection for Katie as a thought trigger to revive himself. He allows Clark into the cabin but is taunted by the hive mind voices and he needs to beat Clark to death. Although successfully disconnected from the hive mind, Adam realizes he can still tap into virtually anyone‚Äôs memory. Adam frees Katie from the other room and tries to disconnect her from the hive. Katie remains possessed and Adam is forced to kill her. He then uses a soldier's memory and a defibrillator to restart Katie‚Äôs heart. Katie returns to life with regained control over her own sentience. Adam and Katie flee the cabin, battle several people possessed by the hive, and eventually escape in a vehicle. However, Adam‚Äôs narration intimates that the world was overrun by the infection and he planted false memories about their escape in Katie‚Äôs mind to protect her from the truth.

They are found on the bodies of mud shrimp (a.k.a. ghost shrimp) of the family Callianassidae, or from water collected from mud shrimp burrows. Description C. dissimile is bright red with the deepest color along the margins of the segments. Pigmented areas often form dense irregular masses on either side of the gut. After several weeks in the laboratory the intensity of the color begins to decrease. The red pigmentation was observed in the naupliar, juvenile, and adult stages.Hayes, Howard J. (1984). Biology of Clausidium dissimile: an epizoic copepod. M.Sc. Thesis, University of West Florida, Pensacola, Florida, U.S.A. The female is short, broad and strongly flattened. It does not have visible eyes. The antennae are not nonprehensile. As characteristic of the genus, the endopods of the first four pairs of legs have sucking disks and the endopod of the first pair of legs has a distinct large flattened plate on the inner margin. Bright orange egg strings may be attached to the genital segment on the left and right sides. The eggs are large and spherical, 25 or 30 in each string. The total length is approximately 1.25 to 1.5 mm and the cephalothorax width is approximately 1 mm.Wilson, Charles B. (1932). The copepods of the Woods Hole region, Massachusetts. Bulletin of the United States National Museum 158: 1-165. The adult male is much smaller than the female. The total length is approximately 0.6 to 0.7 mm and the cephalothorax width is approximately 0.30 mm. It is elongate and slender with appendages like those of the female. It is usually found firmly grasping the anal segment of the female. Besides its size, the chief differences are the maxillipeds and the first pair of legs, both of which are used to grasp the female. The males begin pairing with the juvenile copepodid IV and V stage females. Distribution and Hosts C. dissimile are found on the bodies of mud shrimp (a.k.a. ghost shrimp) of the family Callianassidae. They adhere tenaciously to the host, moving easily over the surface, appendages and into the gill chamber.Gooding, Richard U. (1963). External morphology and classification of marine poecilostome copepods belonging to the families Clausidiidae, Clausiidae, Nereicolidae, Eunicicolidae, Synaptiphilidae, Catiniidae, Anomopsyllidae, and Echiurophilidae. Ph.D. Thesis, University of Washington, Seattle, U.S.A. pp. 1-247. They are occasionally observed swimming free of the host; however, this behavior is uncommon. It appears that C. dissimile can infest any species of Callianassidae that occurs within its range of environmental tolerance. This is a list of known hosts and locations where C. dissimile was captured and identified. C. dissimile can be dislodged during the capture and preservation process. Unless epizoic copepods are the object of the search, the copepods are usually overlooked and lost.

Callianassa trilobata); Big Sabine Point, Santa Rosa Sound, Pensacola Beach, Florida Ecology The relationship between C. dissimile and its host has not been definitively characterized, but is not likely to be parasitism. The mouth parts are not suited either for mastication or suction. They appear to be adopted for licking up nourishment from the surface of the host. The host is not frequently seen outside its burrow which can be 2 meters deep. This behavior can provide protection for C. dissimile from predators that cannot enter the burrow. The host maintains the microenvironment of the burrow by circulating water with its pleopods. The host generated current brings into the burrow suspended plankton and other particles which can accumulate on the host. An examination of the gut contents of C. dissimile showed diatom frustules along with unidentified material. C. dissimile were also observed beating their antennae causing a current which moved suspended particles to the mouth. It is likely that C. dissimile is feeding on material that accumulates on the host. C. dissimile kept in a bowl of seawater without a host lived for 69 days before the test was terminated. When dislodged from its host, C. dissimile will remount on the same or another host upon contact. It has been shown that adult females cannot locate the host at a distance via rheotaxis or chemotaxis. C. dissimile has been found in estuarine habitats and areas exposed to the open ocean. C. dissimile shows stress by abandoning its host when the salinity of the water falls below 15 ppt and appears moribund at 10 ppt. In the field this species was found at locations where the low salinity extremes were occasionally below 10 ppt. At an estuarine location that is subject to occasional freshwater conditions, the heavier higher salinity water in the borrow can provide protection from freshwater exposure. The host pumps water into the burrow which keeps the interior oxygenated. C. dissimile can tolerate hypoxia for three days. This ability may allow it to survive periods when water circulation is reduced or eliminated by low tides or sand clogging the burrow entrance. At Big Sabine Point, Pensacola Beach, Florida, C. dissimile begins settling on the host at the copepodid II and III stages in March and April. The settling of early juveniles extends until October. The ratio of adult males to females typically ranged from 1:1 to 3:1, with 6:1 not unusual. Over 95% of the hosts were infested. The maximum number of copepods on an individual host could range from a few hundred to over 1,000. At a location in Tampa Bay, Florida, the maximum infestation rates observed was approximately 90 to 100 copepods per host. The infested mud shrimp did not exhibit adverse effects. C. dissimile are capable of leaving the host and can be collected from samples of burrow water. In the laboratory they are occasionally observed swimming free of the host and moving between hosts when multiple hosts were in the same container. This was especially apparent when the host is injured or dying. In Tampa Bay, Florida, C. dissimile colonizes ‚Äò‚ÄôSergio trilobata‚Äô‚Äô at a higher frequency than ‚Äò‚ÄôLepidophthalmus louisianensis‚Äô‚Äô. In the laboratory this preference occurred no matter which host C. dissimile had formerly inhabited. The copepods seem to base their selection of host primarily on the size of the host, rather than the sex of the host.

In the final, Mendis scored another fifty, guiding the team to win the series by 6 wickets. His all-round performances in the series gave him his first player of the series award. On the first Test against Bangladesh at Galle, Mendis scored his second Test century, just fall short 6 runs for his double hundred. His score of 194, before he was caught by Tamim Iqbal. On 28 March 2017, in the second ODI against Bangladesh at Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium, Mendis scored his maiden ODI century, with 102 runs. However, the match ended as a no result, due to heavy rain. On 8 June 2017 against India in 2017 ICC Champions Trophy, Mendis scored a match-winning 89 runs to seal the match for Sri Lanka. In the match, Sri Lanka chased 321 runs scored by India, by recording the highest successful run chase in Champion's Trophy history. He along with Danushka Gunathilaka stood 159-run stand for the second wicket and helped to reach the mark. This was Sri Lanka's joint-highest chase, and their first successful 300-plus chase since the 2015 World Cup as well. On 30 June 2017 against Zimbabwe, Mendis passed 1,000 ODI runs, becoming the joint second-fastest (with Tharanga) for Sri Lanka to achieve this. During the first Test against Bangladesh in 2018, Mendis scored his fourth Test hundred. His hundred came on the third day of the match, which was on his 23rd birthday. Mendis along with Dhananjaya de Silva scored 308-run partnership to the second wicket until De Silva dismissed for 173 runs. However, Mendis was dismissed for 196 runs, four runs short of his maiden double century just before the tea break. Mendis' career-best score of 196, however, made him the second Sri Lankan after Kumar Sangakkara to get out in the 190s at least twice. After good performances in Tests against Bangladesh, Mendis was named to the T20I squad for Sri Lanka by replacing injured Kusal Perera. In the first match, he scored a match winning knock of 53 from 27 balls. Bangladesh scored 193 in their 20 overs, which is their highest T20I total.

In May 2018, he was one of 33 cricketers to be awarded a national contract by Sri Lanka Cricket ahead of the 2018‚Äì19 season. Ups and downs Mendis was totally out of form during the 2018 Asia Cup, where he was dismissed for naught in both games against Bangladesh and Afghanistan. His place in the team was in doubt with poor performances, where he was omitted from the England tour in Sri Lanka. But during the ODI series, Mendis was called into the squad for the remainder of the series against England, as a replacement for Kusal Perera, who suffered a quad strain in the second ODI. In his comeback match, he was again dismissed for naught. In the fourth ODI, he batted in the middle order and scored only 5 runs and England won the series 3‚Äì0. In the last match, Mendis batted in the number-4 position. After 24 innings without a fifty, he scored a 30-ball half century in the match with 6 huge sixes.

Mendis along with Angelo Mathews batted all over fourth day, which was the fifth time that Sri Lankan pair had done that in Test history. On the fifth day, they put on an unbeaten double century partnership which overall lasts for 115 wicketless overs for New Zealanders. With rain interrupted, the match was ended in a draw. The partnership of 246, was also Sri Lanka's highest for any wicket against New Zealand and also Sri Lanka's highest in the second innings of a Test. It was the first time a Sri Lankan pair has added 200-plus runs in the second innings of a Test outside Asia. In the second Test, Mendis reached 1,000 Test runs in the calendar year 2018. He became only the second player after Virat Kohli to achieve the feat. He finished 2018 as the second-highest run-scorer in Test cricket, with 1,023 runs at an average 46.50, including three centuries and four fifties. During the two-match test series against South Africa, Mendis continued his poor form with bat with scores 0, 12 and 16. However, his fielding efforts at slip improved in each innings. However, in the second innings of the second test at Port Elizabeth, Mendis scored his 9th test fifty. He along with newcomer Oshada Fernando put on an unbeaten partnership of 163 runs off 213 balls to win the match by 8 wicket. Eventually, Sri Lanka won the series 2-0 and Mendis was adjudged man of the match. It was the first Test series won by Sri Lanka in South Africa. In April 2019, he was named in Sri Lanka's squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. On 1 September 2019 during first T20I against New Zealand, he scored quick 79 runs off 53 balls to set a target of 174. However, Sri Lanka lost the match. In the last over of second T20I, he had a collision with Shehan Jayasuriya at the boundary line. Jayasuriya was running from long on, and Mendis from midwicket, in order to intercept an aerial Mitchell Santner, he tripped up by the onrushing Mendis, and sent crashing into the boundary. Both players picked up knee injuries and rested from the third T20I. During the first Test against Zimbabwe on 19 January 2020, Mendis scored his eleventh fifty. He made 80 runs off 163 deliveries in the match and had a strong partnership with eventual double centurion Angelo Mathews. Sri Lanka went on to win the match by 10 wickets. In the second Test, Mendis scored his seventh century with an unbeaten 116 in the second innings, with Sri Lanka winning the series 1‚Äì0. On 25 February 2020, against the West Indies, Mendis scored his second ODI century. Along with Avishka Fernando, they made a 239-run partnership for the third wicket, with Sri Lanka eventually making 345/8. The West Indies collapsed in the chase and Sri Lanka won the match by 161 runs. This was the biggest win in terms of runs against the West Indies by Sri Lanka in ODIs, with Sri Lanka taking an unassailable lead in the series. Personal life In July 2020, Mendis was arrested after being involved in a fatal road accident in Panadura. Mendis was driving a vehicle that hit an elderly cyclist, who later died in hospital. A day after the incident, Mendis was released on bail. International awards * Dialog SLC Future Cricketer of the Year 2015‚Äì16. * Dialog SLC ODI Batsman of the year 2016‚Äì17.

The single-tube tunnel carried double track of the Dovre Line, allowing it to bypass the village of Morskogen. Construction was part of a new double track between Langset and Kleverud. This was built jointly with the new European Road E6 four-lane motorway. The Ulvin Tunnel will allow for higher speeds and more traffic on the Dovre Line. The Ulvin Tunnel runs in the same area as the Morskogen Tunnel of said motorway. The route was controversial due to it hugging the shoreline of the lake Mj√∏sa. Local and environmental authorities wanted most of the railway and motorway to run in tunnels. It resulted in a compromise, where the Ulvin Tunnel allowed for a longer section of lakeshore to remain untouched. The groundwork contract was awarded to Veidekke and Hochtief, along with other works. The permanent way was laid by Infranord; Eltel installed the electrical and telecommunications systems. The tunnel is scheduled for opening on 23 November 2015. Specifications The Ulvin Tunnel is long and runs roughly north‚Äìsouth through the Ulvin area in Eidsvoll. It is built with a curve, allowing the Dovre Line to bypass the village of Morskogen. The single-tube tunnel is dimensioned for a speed of and is electrified at . The Ulvin tunnel passes under part of the Morskogen Tunnel, a twin-tubed tunnel which carries the E6. History The original railway line along the shore of Mj√∏sa opened as part of the segment from Eidsvoll to Hamar on 8 November 1880. The single track segment received electric traction on 15 June 1953, centralized traffic control on 22 March 1965 and automatic train stop on 1 November 1983. The Ulvin area received a station, at first named Ulvin and later Morskogen. It featured a passing loop and served as a stop until 1 June 1980. The entire line from Eidsvoll to Hamar originally ran entirely without tunnels. The single track and curvature limit both the capacity and the speed of trains. Between Eidsvoll Station and Hamar Station there is no additional capacity for additional trains. Due to the limitations in horizontal curvature, the section of line is predominantly limited to speeds under . The North Corridor provides poor reliability and punctuality, especially for regional, long-distance and freight trains, which are only on time about seventy percent of the time. Two- thirds of the delays are caused by the infrastructure, in part due to exceeding the line's capacity, in part due to technical faults, especially the signaling and power systems. As part of the InterCity Triangle upgrades, this section has been identified as a priority. A new double track from Eidsvoll to Hamar will allow for a doubling of the number of trains, improved reliability and a reduction of the travel time from Hamar to Oslo to one hour. This required an all-new double-track line to be built from Oslo to Hamar. The first part, the Gardermoen Line, opened on 27 September 1998. Meanwhile, there was planning of a new four-lane motorway to be built to replace the E6 from Gardermoen to Kolomoen. The go-ahead for this project was approved by the government in 2006. Due to the proximity of the motorway and railway routes, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration teamed up with the National Rail Administration to establish common plans and construction for the project. The section from Minnesund in Eidsvoll to Skaberud in Stange was the most controversial. There were two general alternatives ‚Äì building the road and railway along the lakeshore of Mj√∏sa, or building major portions of the infrastructure in tunnels. In addition it was possible to elect an intermediate route which would build tunnels along some of the most critical places. The infrastructure authorities initially proposed a route with no major tunnels, in order to save NOK 500 million. The two most contended locations were at √òrbeck/Korslund and Morskogen/Ulvin. In the latter the Public Roads Administration recommended a culvert. Several institutions opposed this view, with among others both municipalities, the Directorate for Nature Management. They cited the value of the lakeshore areas and were concerned that building the railway and motorways right on the shore would have a decremental effect on the recreational opportunities in the area. The disagreement at first resulted in negotiations between various public agencies. Due to the county border running through the right-of-way, involved parties included Eidsvoll and Stange Municipalities, Akershus and Hedmark County Municipalities, and the County Governors of Oslo/Akershus and Hedmark. In the end the County Governors asked the Ministry of the Environment to decide on the issue. The route was finalized in a joint announcement from the Ministry of Transport and Communications, and the Ministry of the Environment on 24 February 2009. Minister of Transport, Liv Signe Navarsete, described the choice as a compromise. Most of the route was placed along the lakeshore, while the most valuable sections, at Morskogen and Ulvin, were protected by placing the railway and motorway through tunnels. The E6‚ÄìDovre Line Joint Project was formalized as a joint venture between the Public Roads Administration and the National Rail Administration on 6 July 2010. Through the joint effort the two agencies estimated that the project would save about NOK 400 million by awarding common contracts to build both the railway and the motorway. One contributing cause was that earthwork removed during the road construction could be used to fill in for the railway tracks. For the railway the Joint Project was responsible for building a section from Langset to Kleverud. Railway tunnels built in Norway during the 1990s and 2000s had been plagued with leaks. These can stop all traffic is the water drips on technical installations, causing short circuiting. To avoid such issues, the National Rail Administration chose to instead build the tunnel with concrete lining. This involved that the tunnel was built with a waterproof plastic membrane on the inside of the concrete. The administration estimates this increases the tunnel's lifetime from 50 to 100 years. This alternative was used in both the Ulvin Tunnel and the two other tunnels in the project. It received criticism from some researchers, who stated that a membrane was unnecessarily expensive, that it is near impossible to repair any breaches which might occur and that use of foreign technology could weaken Norway's international reputation in tunneling. The Ulvin Tunnel was built as part of FP2, from Br√∏haug to Strandlykkja. The Joint Project asked for common bids to build both the railway and the motorway on the section. FP2 was won by a joint venture between Veidekke and Hochtief. The contract, including the blasting of the tunnel, cost NOK 1.6 billion. They blasted all but the last of the southern portal, which was blasted by H√¶hre Entrepren√∏r. Preliminary work on the tunnel started in March 2011. The first blasting took place on 2 September 2011, when work on the tunnel's crosscut started. The National Rail Administration offered a service to residents in the area where they could receive a Short Message Service message every time blasting was to be carried out. Construction of the road segment commenced on 12 April 2012. Combined the projects cost NOK 10.1 billion. One of the major contractors, Alpine Bau, filed for bankruptcy in June 2013, causing considerable delays in the project. However, this had little effect on the works on the Ulvin Tunnel. Each tunneling shift counted 33 people, working around the clock in three eight- hour shifts. Work progressed using a mold. One such a section was completed, the work advanced a further . This process was repeated 333 times. Blasting had to take place at regular intervals, when there were no trains running on the railway line nearby. Access was limited, among other things because of the tracks running past and the steep terrain. The work involved blasting of earthwork, transported away in 25,000 truckloads. The membrane covers and area of , while the lining required of concrete. Most of the earthwork was ditched in Mj√∏sa, at depths of up to . This gave reclaimed land which could be used to build the right-of-way for the railway. A fatal accident took place in May 2013, when a truck backed over a worker in the tunnel. Surveys carried out by the Norwegian Institute for Water Research showed that Mj√∏sa had not been polluted by the construction, nor that the plankton or organisms had been adversely effected. The contract for the permanent way, including ballast, track and the overhead wires was issued to Infranord and was worth NOK 163.9 million. The contract for the signaling, telecommunications and power supply was issued to Eltel and was worth NOK 146.2 million. The latter included lighting, ventilation and other technical components in the tunnels. Both contracts were for the entire section. Infranord used a SVM 1000 track-laying train in November 2014 to lay the permanent way. The long train was able to lay about of ballast, ties and track each day.

Established on 1 April 2015, it replaced the former Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), following the Parker Review of the operations of ACPO.  History  The NPCC was established on 1 April 2015 as the replacement organisation of the Association of Chief Police Officers. In 2010, the Cameron Government announced a series of police reforms including local accountability through Police and Crime Commissioners, and the creation of the National Crime Agency and the College of Policing. In 2013, the PCCs commissioned General Sir Nick Parker to review the services that ACPO provided and make recommendations about the requirements of a national policing body following the fundamental changes in policing. In 2014, a group of chief officers and PCCs began working together to implement Parker's recommendations and develop a national body. Chief officers voted in support of the group's proposals in July 2014. Chief Constable Sara Thornton was appointed to chair the NPCC on 2 December 2014. ACPO was closed down on 31 March 2015. In October 2018 the NPCC threatened to take legal action in the High Court against government's plans to cut hundreds of millions of pounds from police funding. The Treasury plans to increase the money each force pays to the police pension scheme. This would involve forces paying a ¬£420m bill, as well as the 19% cut to police funding since 2010. Police chiefs maintain reductions have make it hard for forces to protect the public. Leaders of three of the biggest forces fear officer levels will drop to those of the 1970s. The NPCC fears if the ¬£420 million bill is dealt with only by cutting police numbers, this will mean 10,000 fewer officers.  Structure and membership  The NPCC is founded by a legal agreement between chief constables, Police and Crime Commissioners, and non-Home Office police force equivalents under Section 22A of the Police Act 1996. It is hosted by the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) but acts independently. The NPCC brings together and is funded by police forces in England, Wales and Northern Ireland as well as the armed services and some British overseas territories. It draws on the efforts and expertise of chief officers: those ranked Assistant Chief Constable and above, or Commander and above in MPS and City of London Police, and senior police staff equivalents. It coordinates police forces' collective operational responses to national threats such as terrorism, organised crime and national emergencies. The current chair of the National Police Chiefs‚Äô Council is Martin Hewitt, previously vice-chair (2015-2019). Giles York and Dave Thompson (Chief Constables of Sussex Police and West Midlands Police respectively) support him as Vice-chairs in addition to their day jobs as chief officers within forces.  Chief Constables' Council  The Chief Constables' Council is the senior operational decision-making body for the National Police Chiefs' Council. Every police force is represented in the work of the NPCC through the Chief Constables' Council. The Chief Constables‚Äô Council is the primary decision- making forum for the NPCC. Chief constables (and equivalents) meet quarterly to discuss operational policing issues and agree action. Working with the College of Policing, the council takes decisions on national standards and common approaches with the aim of protecting the public from the most serious and strategic threats. Coordination committees In addition to their day jobs, chief officers support the NPCC's work by providing national operational perspectives on particular crime and policing issues. There are eleven broad coordination committees, each led by a chief officer. Within each area, chief officers may also lead on specific issues - for example, under the Crime Operations Coordination Committee there are individual leads for domestic abuse, rape, drugs and cyber-crime. The coordination committees cover: * Crime Operations * Criminal Justice * Equality, Diversity and Human Rights * Finance * Information Management * International Coordination * Local Policing * Operations * Performance Management * Workforce * Counter terrorism (chaired by Metropolitan Police Service Assistant Commissioner and responsible for the National Counter Terrorism Policing Network) Coordination committees work closely with the College of Policing to assist in the development of professional practice for police officers in different areas of policing. Representatives from the Government and other stakeholders in the criminal justice system and third sector are involved in the committees‚Äô work to include a range of perspectives.  Projects  The NPCC operates and/or collaborates with the following police projects: * ACRO Criminal Records Office (ACRO) * AVCIS Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service (AVCIS) * International Crime Coordination Centre (ICCC) * National Ballistics Intelligence Service (NABIS) * National Domestic Extremism and Disorder Intelligence Unit (NDEDIU) * National Police Coordination Centre (NPoCC) * National Police Freedom of Information and Data Protection Unit (NPFDU) * National Wildlife Crime Unit (NWCU) * Secured by Design * UK National Counter Terrorism Policing HQ (NCTP HQ)  See also  * Operation Hydrant  References   External links  * Law enforcement in the United Kingdom 2015 establishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"National Police Chiefs' Council"},{"id":"47093260","text":"Big Business is a 1937 American comedy film directed by Frank R.

Interactive architecture encompasses building automation but goes beyond it by including forms of interaction engagements and responses that may lay in pure communication purposes as well as in the emotive and artistic realm, thus entering the field of interactive art. Interactive architecture part of the Internet of things, a term first coined by Kevin Ashton of Procter & Gamble, later MIT's Auto-ID Center, in 1999, can include both interior and exterior elements. Within the interior, many technologies are competing to see who will emerge as the dominant communicative signal. 4GLTE LTE (telecommunication) being replaced eventually by 5G, is the obvious solution; however, visible light communication or Li-Fi, a term first introduced by Harald Haas during a 2011 TEDGlobal talk in Edinburgh, is gaining ground as research into this type of data transfer method increases. Interactive architecture and designing buildings with this technology embedded in it is essential in the development of smart cities. Another essential element in the development of a smart city is the landscape architecture. The space in-between buildings used by the public, or the public realm as it is more commonly termed. There are two levels of communication within the public realm and the difference between the two are commonly accepted as the differentiation between IoT and IoE. IoE, or the Internet of Everything, was a phrase first used by Cisco in an attempt to achieve polarity with competitors that had embraced the term IoT. In Cisco's definition, however, they highlighted interaction with the human node as one main difference between IoT and IoE. The two public realm communication protocols that make that space a smart space are: * The Intelligent Realm, or i-realm, defined as a realm designed with embedded information and communication technology, which allows the silo elements of that space, lighting, ventilation, traffic signals, transportation, waste management, to communicate with one another for the purpose of making that urban area more efficient and effective. * The second communication protocol is the Interactive Realm, defined as incorporating all of the technology needed to create an intelligent realm but in addition, using communication methods such as Global Positioning System, geo-fence, near-field communication and embedded Bluetooth Low Energy, to allow communication between the architecture of the space and the consumers of it. Sometimes referred to as the physical web by Google, an interactive realm uses exterior lighting, bollards, street furniture, bus stops and other elements to communicate to the public via their smartphone or tablet. Whilst IoT concerns itself with communication between objects in order to make the design more efficient and interactive from an operational stand point. IoE in addition also incorporates communication between embedded objects and user devices. The applications include wayfinding, safety, anti-terrorism, targeted advertising, general information such as history of the space or simply just to make the space more enjoyable.Architecture ","title":"Interactive architecture"},{"id":"47093339","text":"Melody for Two is a 1937 American musical film directed by Louis King and starring James Melton, Patricia Ellis and Marie Wilson.

She didn't really shop it around as much as in retrospect I think she might have because she just thought if Gary wasn't going to publish it, probably nobody would. She actually said that to me. Then she sent it to one of the other smaller presses, and finally Ecco bought it. That was good, but it took a while. It had been finished several years before it finally saw print.\\"  Literary significance and reception  Joy Press, writing in The Village Voice, said Davis' style made her think of Davis as \\"[...] the love child of Virginia Woolf and Lewis Carroll, with a splash of Nabokov, Bront√´, and Angela Carter in the gene pool.\\" On Hell itself, she wrote: \\"Hell is her tour de force, a topsy-turvy anti-narrative that juxtaposes the domesticated misery of a 1950s family with the excesses of 19th-century master chef Antonin Car√©me and Victorian household expert Edwina Moss.\\" A review in The New York Times praised Davis' haunting language: \\"Davis's writing shines brightest when, with sinuous sentences and catalogues of objects, she describes interiors so complex that you feel as if you'd stepped into a box assembled by Joseph Cornell.\\"  References  1998 American novels Ecco Press books ","title":"Hell (Davis novel)"},{"id":"47093351","title":"2015 ƒ∞stanbul Cup"},{"id":"47093356","text":"Penicillium patens is an anamorph species of the genus of Penicillium.ATCCUniProt References patens Fungi described in 1985 ","title":"Penicillium patens"},{"id":"47093367","text":"Fred Keating may refer to: *Frederick Keating (1859‚Äì1928), Catholic bishop *Fred Keating (magician) (1901-1961), American magician and film actor *Fred Keating (actor) (b. 1949), Canadian-American television and film actor ","title":"Fred Keating"},{"id":"47093376","text":"James \\"Nobby\\" White (c. 1820 ‚Äì 20 August 1890) was a pastoralist, land agent and politician in the colony of South Australia. History James White arrived in South Australia in 1845. His first occupation was as overseer at C. H. Bagot's head station \\"Koonunga\\". He headed for the diggings in 1851 during the Victorian gold rush, and returned a year later and purchased his first block of land at Bagot's Gap, the first of many pastoral properties in the Kapunda region and elsewhere in the colony, and became quite wealthy. He was a partner in station agents and auctioneers, first with W. Brewer around 1859, then with Jenkin Coles as Coles and Goodchild, later Goodchild, Duff, & Co., which business was taken over by Elder, Smith & Co. in 1889. He was elected MHA for the seat of Light after the resignation of Edward Hamilton, and served August 1871 to December 1871 and from February 1875 to April 1881, his associates being David Nock and Randolph Isham Stow. He stood for reelection in 1881 and 1884 and the 1888 Legislative Council election, but was unsuccessful on each occasion. He was convicted under the Fraud at Auctions Act in 1876, and urged to resign his commission as Justice of the Peace but refused, on the grounds that would constitute admission of guilt. An appeal to the Supreme Court resulted in the controversial overturning of this verdict. Alexander Hay added to his woes by publicly refuting some of his courtroom statements. A year later he was re-appointed J.P. White was a taciturn man and never made many friends. He was buried at the Church of England cemetery, Kapunda. Family James White married Rebecca Bridget Goodchild ( ‚Äì 6 May 1888) and married again, to the widow Bessie Read on 3 November 1888; they lived at \\"Albavale\\", Kapunda. They had no children.

It was constructed by order of Margrave Louis William I of Baden-Baden, also known as \\"Turkish Louis\\", from 1701 in order to protect northern Baden from the newly erected French fortress of Fort Louis on the River Rhine.  Location  The roughly 10-kilometre-long and only partly fortified line started in the east near Obertal (today part of B√ºhlertal), ran westwards over the heights to B√ºhl and then northwest in the Rhine valley via Vimbuch (today a village in the municipality of B√ºhl), Leiberstung (today part of Sinzheim) and Stollhofen to the River Rhine. It comprised linear schanzen in the terrain, as well as individual star schanzen, hornworks, small forts and fortified villages, and used the watercourses on the Rhine Plain in order to flood the fields of fire and approach using weirs. At the same time, by including the villages of B√ºhl and Stollhofen, it enabled control of the old trade routes from Basle to Frankfurt (today the Bundesstra√üe B3) at B√ºhl, and from Strasbourg to Frankfurt (old Roman road, today the B 36). Until 1707, the line bounded the operational area of the French troops and barred the easiest route to Bavaria via Pforzheim.

So he initially occupied Kehl Fortress on 12 March as his base east of the Rhine and, after having uniting with the army of Marshal Tallard,Making a combined force of 50,000 men in 72 battalions and 109 squadrons with 70 guns on 19 April 1703 he began an attack on the B√ºhl-Stollhofen Line. He bombarded the line south of Kappelwindeck and tried, to bypass the line to the east with 25 battalions under Blainville. Both attempts, on 19 and 24 April failed, because the French could not capture the fortifications at Obertal. On 25 April Villars pulled back. In summer 1703, however, Margrave Louis William could not stop Villars marching up the Kinzig valley and on into Bavaria. There Villars was victorious in the First Battle of H√∂chst√§dt. Likewise in 1704, Tallar was able to pass through the Black Forest unhindered along the Dreisamtal valley. After the death of Margrave Louis William (9 January 1707) Villars was able to capture the B√ºhl- Stollhofen Line in May that year without a fight and have it destroyed. Several months after the loss of the B√ºhl-Stollhofen Line, work began on the Ettlingen Line under Rhine Army commander, George Louis of Brunswick-L√ºneburg. This line was reinforced during the War of the Polish Succession (1733‚Äì1738), destroyed by the French in 1734 broke and then rebuilt in 1735.  Today  As a result of the canalization of the Rhine by Tulla in the 19th century and the construction of roads and settlements in the last century the remains of the line are only still visible in places in the wooded areas east of B√ºhl.see description with the images In the B√ºhl Municipal MuseumStadtmuseum B√ºhl is the 1703 map of the B√ºhl-Stollhofen Line drawn by Major Elster.

She went on to a career studying factors that influence research integrity, in particular publication bias and outcome reporting bias. She is retired (as of December 31, 2018) Professor Emerita in the Department of Epidemiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health where she was Director of the Center for Clinical Trials and Evidence Synthesis there. She was also Director of the US Cochrane Center and the US Satellite of the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group within the Cochrane Collaboration. Dickersin received multiple awards for her research.  Education  Dickersin's formal academic and research training spans the basic, clinical, and public health sciences. Dickersin began an undergraduate degree at Bennington College in Bennington, Vermont, planning to major in art. After two years, she transferred undergraduate institutions to University of California, Berkeley. She received both a Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts in Zoology (cell biology), from the UC Berkeley, in 1974 and 1975, respectively. She was awarded a PhD in epidemiology from the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in 1989. While an undergraduate, she received a Howard Hughes Fellowship in Medical Research in 1971, and during her PhD research she received an NIH traineeship.  Career  Dickersin spent two months in Dorothy and Claude A. Villee's research laboratory at Harvard University to complete a \\"field work term‚Äù at Bennington College. Her new interest in science led her to leave Bennington after 2 years, and to work in Allan Tobin's lab in developmental biology at Harvard College. Subsequently, she transferred undergraduate institutions to University of California, Berkeley. At Berkeley, where she did undergraduate and master's degree research, she worked in Daniel Mazia‚Äôs lab. Her master‚Äôs thesis was ‚ÄúIncreased Permeability of Sea Urchin Eggs to Adenine After Fertilization, Parthenogenetic Activation, and Exposure to Ammonia‚Äù. After her master's degree, Dickersin taught biology at two community colleges in California (West Valley College and Fullerton College) and subsequently worked in Roger Sloboda's lab at Dartmouth College doing developmental biology research. While at Fullerton College, and through her biology students, Dickersin learned about the field of epidemiology, which she liked because it merges science with societal concerns and involves experimental research (clinical trials). In addition, in the late 1970s Dickersin believed the opportunities for women in laboratory research were limited. These two factors led her to switch research areas to public health, a field that she believed is more friendly to women. Dickersin matriculated at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in 1979, focusing on clinical trials, and Curtis L. Meinert became her advisor. Her graduate education was interrupted when the family moved to Boston for 4 years in 1981 so that her husband could attend medical school. During this interlude she worked with two influential mentors, Thomas C. Chalmers and Sir Iain Chalmers, and became interested in research synthesis and related biases. When she returned to Baltimore to complete her PhD, she worked on clinical trials as well as research directly linked to publication bias. Her PhD dissertation, ‚ÄúPublication and the Meta-analysis of Clinical Trials,‚Äù was the first in her Department to use the model where a group of related published research papers is bound together with linking text, rather than the traditional model of a stand-alone document with chapters. After completing her PhD in 1989, Dickersin moved to the University of Maryland, School of Medicine, in Baltimore, first to the Department of Ophthalmology and later to the Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine. In 1998, she moved to Brown University School of Medicine where she launched the Center for Clinical Trials and Evidence-Based Healthcare. In 2005, she accepted a position directing the Center for Clinical Trials at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, renamed in 2014 to the Center for Clinical Trials and Evidence Synthesis. Dickersin's research career spanned several areas related to clinical trials and systematic reviews of trials. She has led clinical trials, for example she was principal investigator of two federally funded multicenter randomized trials, the data center for the Ischemic Optic Neuropathy Decompression Trial (IONDT) and the Surgical Treatments Outcomes Project for Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding (STOP-DUB). Dickersin became interested in systematic reviews in the mid-1980s, especially the problem of identifying all relevant research on a topic. While her early research focused on establishing the existence of publication bias and the difficulty of retrieving the clinical trial literature, her later research has explored how selective outcome reporting may distort knowledge from clinical trials. She has also contributed to implementation of ‚Äúfixes‚Äù related to these problems, aimed at increasing research integrity. For example, she has contributed to the establishment of clinical trial registries, promoting public accessibility to trial findings, and establishment of the Cochrane Collaboration in 1993 Over the course of her career, Dickersin served on a variety of federal advisory committees, for example, she was appointed by President Clinton to the National Cancer Advisory Board (1994-2000). Internationally, she was instrumental in starting the World Health Organization‚Äôs International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and served as Co-Chair of the Scientific Advisory Group from 2005-2008 when it was disbanded. She has also served on numerous Institute of Medicine and National Research Council committees, which include for example: The Vaccine Safety Committee (1992-3); Committee to Advise the Department of Defense on its FY 1993 Breast Cancer Program (1993); Committee to Study the Reimbursement of Routine Patient Care Costs for Medicare Patients Enrolled in Clinical Trials (1998-9); Committee to Assess the System for Protecting Human Research Subjects (Advisory Consultant) (2001-2); Committee on the Review of Evidence on High Clinical Value Services (2005-7); Committee on Comparative Effectiveness Research Prioritization (2009); Committee for the Handling Missing Data in Clinical Trials (2009‚Äì10); Committee on Standards for Systematic Reviews of Clinical Effectiveness Research (2009‚Äì11).  Cochrane collaboration  Dickersin was a founding member of the Cochrane Collaboration in 1993, and was on the Steering Committee from 1993 to 1996. She served on the Information Management Steering Group from 2003 to 2005. She directed the US Cochrane Center, which has evolved from one of four original centers (she headed the Baltimore Cochrane Center, the first US-based center, opening in 1994). She also directed the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group, US Satellite, since its inception in 2002 and until June 30, 2018. The US Cochrane Center coordinated the development of Cochrane's Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from 1994 to 2005, which was then turned over to The Cochrane Library publisher for further development and maintenance. Dickersin's papers related to the Cochrane Collaboration are at the National Library of Medicine. In 2018, the US Cochrane Center at Johns Hopkins closed and Kay Dickersin stepped down from her position as its director.  Consumer engagement in research  In 1986, one year after resuming her PhD work, Dickersin was diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. This led to her starting a breast cancer support group, Arm-in-Arm, with Marsha Oakley, and engagement in national and international consumer advocacy work, as a founding mother of the National Breast Cancer Coalition in 1991. Her papers related to the start of the NBCC are at the Schlesinger Library in Cambridge, Massachusetts. As the only scientist on the Board of Directors of the NBCC, Dickersin initiated a series of ‚Äúteach-ins‚Äù for the Board designed to expose Board members to the underlying concepts in biology and epidemiology that they would need to be active contributors to the research agenda. Teaching faculty included Francis Collins and others. This project expanded in 1995 to Project LEAD, a flagship science education program offered by NBCC to consumer advocates and still active in 2014. Her longstanding support for consumer and patient engagement in the research process is also evident from her involvement in the Department of Defense (DoD) Breast Cancer Programme. In 2003, Dickersin initiated a coalition of consumer and health advocacy groups (later named Consumers United for Evidence-based Healthcare or CUE. The idea behind CUE was to bring together consumer groups, who traditionally have not worked together, to form a professional organization for learning and networking. In addition to serving these functions, CUE helps scientist groups to identify consumers for meaningful engagement in research and on advisory and guideline panels. As of 2019, CUE is directed by Dr. Janice Bowie at Johns Hopkins.

The group was celebrating a 21st birthday party in Berkeley, California. The balcony was on the 5th floor of an apartment building at 2020 Kittredge Street in Berkeley, then called Library Gardens. The district attorney of Alameda County launched a criminal probe into the incident. In June 2015 Mayor Tom Bates of Berkeley promised a wide-ranging investigation into the cause of the accident. Considered the likeliest cause is that the balcony of the building was not constructed properly, leading to dry rot, leading to the balcony becoming structurally compromised. Overwhelming evidence points to dry rot causing the collapse, and not the weight of the 13 students on it at the time. 2020 Kittredge Street in 2017. The collapsed balconies were located in the area inside the red box. Details One of the six killed was a dual Irish-American citizen, Ashley Donohoe, 22, of Rohnert Park, California. The five others were Olivia Burke (Donohue's cousin), Eoghan Culligan, Niccolai \\"Nick\\" Schuster, Lorc√°n Miller and Eimear Walsh, all aged 21 and from Dublin, Ireland.Rodriguez, Olga. ‚ÄúCousins killed in Berkeley balcony collapse had twin bond‚Äù. Yahoo News. 20 June 2015. The New York Times reported the deaths and suggested the deceased were to blame for the collapse. The paper stated that \\"the work-visa program that allowed for the exchanges has in recent years become not just a source of aspiration, but also a source of embarrassment for Ireland\\". Taoiseach Enda Kenny and former President Mary McAleese criticised the newspaper for \\"being insensitive and inaccurate\\" in its handling of the story. The newspaper subsequently apologized, with the article still available on its website. The Irish Daily Star and Irish Examiner newspapers published an image of a body bag lying on the ground, prompting a Galway newsagent to remove the two papers as a protest. Investigation Alameda County prosecutors opened up an investigation in the accident on June 25. They stated that involuntary manslaughter charges could be filed against someone.Elias, Paul. ‚ÄúProsecutor: Balcony collapse could bring manslaughter charges‚Äù. Yahoo News. 25 June 2015. On that day, District Attorney Nancy O'Malley denied that pressure from the Irish community led to the collapse inquiry. Rumor had spread that because prosecutors said their involvement was over the Irish had pressured them into a new inquiry. They also said they were looking into previous lawsuits against the complex. They yet declined to comment. On July 3, 2015, the Alameda County Superior Court rejected a restraining order bid by Segue Builders, a construction company, against the examination of evidence. O'Malley had argued the granting of a restraining order would interfere with her duty to investigate the tragedy. Funerals A joint funeral service for Olivia Burke and her cousin Ashley Donohoe took place on June 20, four days after the collapse, in a church in Cotati, California. Funeral services were held in Dublin for the other victims. Litigation In December 2015 a court was told that the collapse happened because contractors cut corners to save costs. It is said the management company for the building, Greystar Real Estate Partners, ignored a \\"red flag\\" when students who rented the apartment complained about mushrooms growing on the balcony. Legal cases by some of the victims were set to be combined and heard together. By the end of 2017 it was reported that most of the lawsuits had been settled.http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/05/05/lawsuits-connected-2015-deadly- berkeley-balcony-collapse-settled/https://ww2.kqed.org/news/2017/11/21/deadly- berkeley-balcony-collapse-lawsuit-settled/ References 2015 disasters in the United States 2015 in California 21st century in Berkeley, California Building collapses in 2015 Ireland‚ÄìUnited States relations Building collapses in the United States ","title":"Berkeley balcony collapse"},{"id":"47093515","title":"2015 Baku Cup"},{"id":"47093528","text":"Arrias Battery (), also known as Xemxija Battery () or Pwales Left Battery (), is an artillery battery in Xemxija, limits of St. Paul's Bay, Malta.

The battery still exists, although it has modern alterations, and it is used as a restaurant. History Arrias Battery was built in 1715‚Äì1716 as part of the Order of Saint John's first building program of batteries and redoubts around the coasts of Malta. It was one of two batteries defending Xemxija Bay, the other one being the now- demolished Dellia Battery. The battery originally consisted of a mostly rectangular platform with a rounded end at the north. It had a low parapet with one embrasure, and the gorge was closed off by a rectangular blockhouse. The redoubt was named after the knight Emmanuele Arrias, and an inscription commemorating him is located above the main entrance. The battery eventually became a summer residence of the Borg Cardona family. They called it ix- Xemxija and later, the area around it began to be referred to by that name. Present day View of the battery showing the rounded end of the gun platform The battery still exists, but several alterations have been made to the structure, mostly during the course of the 20th century. These include a second floor added to the blockhouse, and a flight of steps leading to an entrance facing the sea. The battery is now used as a restaurant, known as The Fortress Wine & Dine. It is a Grade 1 national monument, and it is also listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands.

He first appears in episode 5124 of the show, originally broadcast in the United Kingdom on 21 August 2015. Gavin is the third husband of Kathy Sullivan (Gillian Taylforth) and is also revealed as the biological father of Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean). He is first mentioned as Sharon's father in 1990 and as Kathy's partner after Kathy's departure in 1998, but does not appear on screen until 2015 and it is not known that Sharon's father and Kathy's husband are the same person until October 2015. Viewers are informed in a 2006 episode that Kathy and Gavin are dead, but Kathy returns in February 2015, revealing that Gavin is also alive. Billed as \\"an EastEnders villain like no other\\", Gavin has been described as \\"dangerous\\", \\"sinister\\", \\"nasty\\" and \\"evil\\". His storylines include his \\"abusive\\", \\"controlling\\" and \\"manipulative\\" relationship with Kathy, kidnapping recovering alcoholic Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) and getting him drinking again, and blackmailing Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas). His departure involves kidnapping Kathy, causing the death of his sister Margaret Midhurst (Jan Harvey) and being arrested after threatening to kill himself and Sharon. He appears in 30 episodes, and his final appearance is in episode 5312, broadcast on 8 July 2016. Storylines Having faked her own death, Gavin's wife, Kathy Sullivan (Gillian Taylforth), makes plans to escape Gavin and asks Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) for money on several occasions, saying she is willing to go to prison so she can eventually reunite with her family in Walford. Kathy and Phil arrange to meet at St Pancras International, but she cannot meet him because her son, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), is there. As she leaves, Gavin surprises her, revealing he knows what she has planned. After Kathy makes attempts to contact someone at The Queen Victoria pub, Gavin arrives on Albert Square. He texts Phil, pretending to be Kathy, and meets him, revealing that after St Pancras, he and Kathy planned to fly themselves to Spain but Kathy escaped by crashing the car. Phil discovers that Kathy is staying in a guest house in Kent, but Gavin follows Phil there and finds Kathy first. Phil realises they have gone to a local airfield, so he stops them from leaving and convinces Kathy to go back with him, leaving Gavin behind. When Phil meets Kathy at her hotel room, she agrees with him that there should be no more contact between them. After Phil leaves, it is revealed that Gavin has manipulated her into saying this. Phil goes missing after Gavin and two men confront him at his garage. After Kathy's sons, Ian and Ben Mitchell (Harry Reid), discover she is alive, Gavin finds Kathy in Walford. He tells Kathy to stick to their plan and Phil will stay alive. When Kathy reunites with Ben, Kathy says that she needs all of Phil's money or Gavin will kill him, and Gavin later tells Kathy he will harm Ian and Ben if she does not get the money that night. Kathy decides to go to the police to confess to fraud and to report Phil's kidnapping. When Ian finds out, he calls Gavin, saying he knows what Gavin has done, but Gavin now knows that Kathy has not stuck to their plan. Kathy realises Gavin probably has Phil at his sister's house, but when they get there, Gavin and Phil are gone, but Phil's blood is found. Phil, a recovering alcoholic, gets back home but is covered in cuts and bruises and has broken bones, and reveals to Ben that Gavin deliberately got him drinking alcohol again. Phil has a panic button installed and Kathy helps the police trace Gavin via his mobile phone. Ben tells Gavin to leave or be arrested, as the police have arrived. Ben tells his family that Gavin has left, but Gavin returns, where Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell) apparently recognises him and appears fearful. On Halloween, Kathy is on edge, and she fears Gavin has gone into Ian's house. Ben and Kathy then see Gavin, but are unsure it was him. They go to Phil's house, where Gavin locks Phil and Dennis Rickman (Bleu Landau) in a bedroom. When Kathy attempts to call the police, Gavin appears. He threatens to light fireworks inside the house, hoping to kill himself, Kathy, Ben, Phil and Dennis. Sharon Mitchell (Letitia Dean), Phil's wife and Dennis's mother, arrives and Gavin reveals he knows that Sharon is the adopted daughter of Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) and Angie Watts (Anita Dobson). Gavin surprises Kathy by saying that Walford was once his home and he had a child. Sharon realises Gavin could be her birth father, and he confirms it when he says, \\"Hello, princess\\", which Den used to say to her. Kathy pleads with Gavin not to light the fireworks and promises to leave with him again. Phil escapes, knocks Gavin unconscious and ties him up. While Sharon talks to Kathy, she realises that Margaret Midhurst (Jan Harvey), the solicitor who arranged her adoption and who she has been visiting to track her father, is Gavin's sister. When Gavin wakes up, Sharon asks about her adoption; Gavin says he had a fling with Carol Hanley (Sheila White), who had a breakdown after Sharon's birth, and Gavin was not paternal but Den was, so he traded Sharon for part in a bank raid that Den was working on. Phil then tells Sharon that Gavin previously had him locked in a room with no windows and just a bottle of whisky, meaning Phil turned to alcohol. Sharon decides to call the police so presses Phil's panic button. Sharon then confronts Gavin, who tells her that he asked Den to greet Sharon for him occasionally by calling her \\"princess\\". When the police arrive, Gavin has gone. Sharon reveals she took money from Phil's safe to let Gavin go, and when she meets Margaret again, she confirms she helped Gavin fake his death and gives Sharon his phone number. Sharon calls and leaves a message, and later receives a text message, saying they will see each other soon. On Christmas Day, Gavin texts Sharon and later arrives at her house, saying he has missed her. Sharon hurries him out and he leaves her a present. He also visits her in hospital when her son Dennis Rickman (Bleu Landau) is involved in a car crash. He invites her to Hong Kong but she declines, promising to still keep in touch and thanking him for the present. When Sharon tells Gavin that she is ending her marriage to Phil, he visits her, offering his support. She rejects him and the gift he has left for Dennis, saying she does not want liars in her life, but he insists he has never lied to her and reminds her of his offer to join him overseas, insisting that he will have a steady job and that he wants a second chance of having a family. Sharon and Dennis later join Gavin.

She threatens to call the police, but he asks her to pass on a message to Sharon, revealing that he has been on holiday with her and Dennis, but she left. Dot Branning (June Brown) then arrives, and eventually she remembers Gavin from his childhood in Walford, saying that he was a troublemaker who stole money from Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin), and warns Kathy off getting involved. Gavin simply says he wants the opportunity to be a good father and grandfather, and cries when he remembers that he was unwanted by his own mother. After Dot leaves, Kathy realises that Gavin does not like being on his own and promises to pass on the messaage. Before he leaves, he kisses Kathy as a thank you, saying he misses her. Kathy speaks to Sharon, who reveals that she left the holiday because Gavin hit Dennis. Sharon meets Gavin who says he did it out of love but Sharon wants nothing to do with him. Later, Sharon discovers that Gavin has collected Dennis from school and given him a mobile phone. She meets Gavin and offers him ¬£100,000 to leave forever, revealing that she is selling her half of her bar to fund this. Gavin asks her for another chance but she rejects him and he leaves. After Sharon tells Gavin it will take some weeks to get the money, Gavin sees Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas) and her family and concludes that they must be wealthy. Gavin blackmails Clauedtte, threatening to reveal a secret from her past. Claudette attempts to pay Gavin with sex, but afterwards he says it is not a payment and asks how Claudette killed her husband, Henry. When he demands more money, she strikes him over the head with a candelabra. She believes he is dead and takes him to the basement, and when her son Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood) arrives, she lies about the circumstances, but when Gavin escapes, her lies are revealed to Vincent. Gavin returns to Claudette's home and meets Vincent, who says Claudette has left the country. Gavin says he will track her down, so Vincent offers to pay off the money Gavin claims she owes him. Sharon then meets Gavin and gives him the money from her sale of her bar (to Vincent), and he asks for a reconciliation but she rejects him. He meets Margaret, saying she will get her share of the money, and states that Sharon is now dead to him as he has another plan, which Margaret calls \\"insane\\". Two months later, it is revealed that Dennis and Gavin are still in contact. After another six weeks, Margaret visits Sharon, saying that Gavin is acting strangely, but Sharon dismisses this and sends Margaret away. Later, Gavin tells Kathy he has Dennis so she reluctantly gets in his car and is seen leaving by Buster Briggs (Karl Howman). Sharon sees that Dennis has been in contact with Gavin and Buster tells Sharon what he saw so, fearing for Kathy's safety, they get Gavin's address from Dennis. Kathy and Gavin arrive at a large country house that he bought with Sharon's money, and he locks them in, saying they can live there together. Kathy realises that Dennis is not there, and then Margaret arrives. Gavin locks Kathy in a room as Margaret and Gavin argue, and Margaret knocks Gavin unconscious and lets Kathy out of the room. Gavin regains consciousness and the women try to escape. As Sharon and Buster arrive, a woman falls onto the windscreen of the car and lies dead on the floor. Sharon realises it is Margaret, and she and Buster break into the house where Buster finds Kathy while Sharon confronts Gavin, who is packing a bag with cash. Sharon locks the door and Gavin insists that Margaret's death was an accident. Sharon asks him why he stayed in contact with Dennis when she paid him to stay away, so he says he would never harm his grandson. She tells him to give himself up to the police and if he does so, she will visit him in prison with Dennis and they can be a family when he gets released. Police and paramedics then arrive, as Sharon called them and Gavin accuses her of stalling until they arrived, but she insists she called them for Margaret's sake. Gavin says he will give himself up to the police so Sharon unlocks the bedroom door, but he then tries to escape. He sees his only way out is via the balcony but he is too scared of harming himself to jump. Sharon joins him on the balcony and he asks Sharon to tell the police that Margaret fell. A police officer then arrives on the balcony and Gavin grabs Sharon, threatening to jump, killing them both. Sharon says he could never kill himself so he lets her go and she tells him it is over between them. Gavin is then arrested. Development Introduction After it was confirmed that Taylforth was returning to EastEnders, executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins teased about Gavin in May 2015 when he said of Kathy's return: \\"It's a big, big story with lots of twists and turns. We know that there was a man named Gavin, who Kathy went off with to South Africa. So there's Gavin, Kathy‚Äîand lots of Phil [Mitchell] involved.\\" Then, on 17 June, Treadwell-Collins posted on Twitter a photo of part of a script, featuring Gavin, and the caption \\"He's on his way...\\". The following day, 18 June, Paul Nicholas's casting in the role was announced, and it was confirmed that the character would play a major part in Kathy's return storyline. Nicholas said of his role: \\"I am delighted to be joining the wonderful cast of EastEnders for what is going to be an exciting time ahead. I can't wait to get started and seeing what's in store for my character.\\" Executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins said: \\"We are all thrilled that Paul has agreed to join our cast to play Gavin. So many British television viewers have grown up with Paul Nicholas so it's brilliant to have him back on our screens, playing a major part in Kathy's explosive return to the Square, while also holding the key to many more of the Square's secrets.\\" Nicholas later said it was \\"great\\" for him to join a \\"brilliantly produced and very well acted\\" show, but said it was \\"quite daunting\\" as he had not acted in a soap opera before. He said that when he joined the cast, he met the writers who explained the character to him and gave him a \\"really good insight into where they wanted it to go\\" and added, \\"It is nice to be involved in something so successful and that people actually watch.\\" Two days after Nicholas's casting was announced, Nicholas and Taylforth were seen filming on location at King's Cross station, for Gavin's introduction scene that aired on 21 August 2015, and on 30 June, on-location photos emerged of Nicholas, Taylforth, Steve McFadden (Phil Mitchell) and Samantha Womack (Ronnie Mitchell), filming at an airfield in Essex, for Gavin's third episode, broadcast on 11 September 2015. Villainy During an EastEnders press event, Treadwell-Collins stated that it was hoped Gavin would be \\"an EastEnders villain like no other\\", and described him as \\"modern, complex and he will have a little foot in the past and a foot in the present.\\" Treadwell-Collins later said, \\"Paul Nicholas has created the most manipulative and dangerous EastEnders villain we've ever had. He makes Archie Mitchell look like a Care Bear.\\" Discussing this comparison, Rachel McGrath of The Huffington Post UK said, \\"He makes the murderous, abusive, rapist Archie look like a child's cuddly toy. We're genuinely terrified.\\" Vicky Prior from the Metro called Treadwell-Collins' claim \\"bold [...] for a show that has produced some of TV's most iconic villains\\", and included in her list Nick Cotton (John Altman), Archie (Larry Lamb), Lucas Johnson (Don Gilet), Trevor Morgan (Alex Ferns), Phil Mitchell, Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp), Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood), Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), Chrissie Watts (Tracy-Ann Oberman), Ronnie Mitchell, Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd), Yusef Khan (Ace Bhatti) and Babe Smith (Annette Badland), saying that \\"I don't think Gavin will find it easy to earn a place in Walford's Rogues Gallery. I expect EastEnders to have some extra dramatic plots coming up to help Gavin out though.\\" Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly said that the script snippet posted online by Treadwell-Collins \\"hinted that the character will be a formidable force\\". Nicholas said about Gavin: \\"I wouldn't say he was the most charming man I've ever played.\\" However, Taylforth said that he is a \\"charming character, who can turn menacing, dark and deep\\", and called him \\"horrible\\". Taylforth also said that Gavin is \\"very cunning\\" and \\"knows everyone's weakness and uses it\\", and called him a \\"tyrant\\". Harry Reid, who plays Kathy and Phil's son Ben Mitchell, called Gavin \\"a nasty bloke with an edge to him.\\" Additionally, Danny Walker from the Daily Mirror called him \\"moody\\", James Leyfield from the Daily Mirror called him an \\"east end bad boy\\", Nigel Pauley from the Daily Mirror called him a \\"psycho gangster\\", and Inside Soap called Gavin \\"wicked\\" and \\"Walford's new baddy\\", with Kate White from the magazine calling him \\"sinister\\". Amy Duncan from the Metro called him \\"calculated\\", Duncan Lindsay from the Metro called him \\"scheming\\", and Soaplife called him \\"mysterious\\", \\"slippery\\", \\"grim\\", and a \\"ruthless operator\\". What's on TV described him as a \\"vicious gangster\\", \\"threatening\\" and \\"dodgy\\", and All About Soap called him \\"evil\\". A show insider told Inside Soap that Gavin is \\"a nasty piece of work\\". Nicholas later said that the fact that Gavin comes in and out of the show \\"makes him more unpredictable, I think. Unpredictable villains are the best.\\" Relationship with Kathy Speaking of Gavin and Kathy's relationship, Taylforth said that he is so manipulative towards her that \\"She can't function without [him]\\" and she has \\"been brainwashed\\". She said that Gavin has \\"a hold on her\\" and has \\"knocked her down so much\\" and explained that he has convinced her she is a bad mother, adding \\"she's really frightened of him\\". She claimed that Kathy loves Gavin and \\"he convinces her that he loves her, too\\" and makes her believe that everything is her fault. She also said that Gavin has reasons for controlling everything Kathy does and has \\"little ways of getting round her.\\" Kate White from Inside Soap said, \\"Kathy is fighting for survival and knows how twisted Gavin is.\\" Inside Soap said the script snippet \\"seems to indicate that Gavin is one step ahead of his wife\\", saying that the reason Kathy always seems to look nervous is because of Gavin. Inside Soap also said that Kathy is scared because of \\"her marriage to the dangerous Gavin Sullivan\\". David Brown from Radio Times said Gavin and Kathy have a \\"poisonous marriage\\", and a show insider told Inside Soap that Gavin and Kathy's marriage was \\"built on mind games and his twisted ability to control her.\\" Soaplife said that \\"Kathy will testify [that] he's not the sort of [man] to take rejection lying down.\\" Phil Mitchell In relation to Gavin's first scenes with Kathy's former husband Phil, it was said that Gavin \\"will not be taking no for an answer\\" and he \\"doesn't take things quietly\\", with Treadwell-Collins calling the storyline \\"a really exciting thriller\\". Further scenes between Phil and Gavin prompted Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy to think that Phil \\"may have met his match\\". A show insider told Inside Soap, \\"He's not afraid to get his hands dirty, even [if] it means butting heads with the notorious Mitchell family. Phil should watch out‚Äîthis one's a real handful!\\" On the storyline where Gavin has Phil kidnapped and demands money to spare his life, an EastEnders insider told Inside Soap, \\"Gavin knows which buttons to push to frighten Kathy into doing exactly what he wants. He wants that money, he wants her by his side, and if things don't go as he wants, Phil is going to pay a high price.\\" Treadwell-Collins said of the kidnap storyline: \\"What Gavin does to Phil while he's off screen will take Phil in a whole new direction that will run into next year [2016].\\" Taylforth confirmed that what Gavin does to Phil is the reason Phil starts drinking again, saying \\"Gavin knows that drinking is Phil's weakness\\". This has an ongoing impact on Phil and the Mitchells, with Treadwell-Collins calling Phil \\"a broken man\\" and confirming it was the start of a storyline that would continue until Easter 2016. Ben Mitchell The relationship between Gavin and his stepson Ben (played by actor Harry Reid, pictured) was described as \\"an interesting dynamic\\". Ben actor Reid spoke of his character's relationship with Gavin, saying that Gavin was a father figure to Ben for several years, adding, \\"He grew up with him and there will be a lot of love there. Ben came back [from South Africa, after Kathy and Gavin faked their deaths] a happy child, so you think Gavin is a perfect dad as he helped create that kid. There's a real connection there between them, having spent time together and loved each other.\\" Reid also said that Gavin \\"clearly didn't do a bad job\\" of raising Ben, Ben does not blame Gavin for being lied to about Kathy and Gavin's fake deaths, and Ben finds Gavin more understanding than his own father. However, he said that Ben knows Gavin has a \\"nasty edge\\". Treadwell- Collins promised \\"an interesting dynamic\\" between Ben and Gavin, saying that Gavin would \\"manipulate Ben as well as Kathy\\". Paternity of Sharon Watts Several news outlets reported speculation that Gavin could be the birth father of Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean). Treadwell-Collins' comment that the character would \\"have a little foot in the past and a foot in the present\\" and is \\"holding the key to many more of the Square's secrets\\" caused David Brown, writer for Radio Times, to wonder what Gavin's connection to the past would be, saying \\"it's surely no coincidence that Sharon has recently been searching for her birth dad‚Äîa man who we know to also be called Gavin.\\" Brown said it would \\"make for some intriguing family dynamics.\\" Inside Soap said that they had a hunch that Kathy's husband Gavin and Sharon's father Gavin could be the same person, making Sharon Kathy's stepdaughter. All About Soap said it \\"cannot be a coincidence\\" that Sharon's real father has the same name. Speculation increased when on-location photos emerged, showing Kathy with police outside a house, which looks similar to scenes already shown of Sharon visiting the street where her father lives, and both scenes took place in Notting Hill. Carl Greenwood from the Daily Mirror said that \\"Two huge EastEnders storylines could be set to converge\\" if Gavin is Sharon's father. An EastEnders source said: \\"Eagle-eyed viewers will spot police are in the same area as Sharon was looking for her dad\\". Brown later said that it would \\"be a treat\\" to see Gavin revealed as Sharon's father, as it would also make him the grandfather of Dennis \\"Denny\\" Rickman Jnr (Bleu Landau), Sharon's son with Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman), and said \\"Something tells me that Gavin wouldn't be cheery grandpa offering up the Werther's Originals to Denny while they watch the Antiques Roadshow together. More likely, he'd be getting him down Basher Jim's for a bit of boxing training before introducing him into his criminal empire.\\" However, All About Soap wondered if Phil had actually sent Sharon to a fake address. Amy Duncan from the Metro said, \\"perhaps there are just two Gavins with links to Albert Square living in Notting Hill.\\" Duncan Lindsay from the Metro wondered if Phil might know that Gavin is Sharon's father, which is why he did not want Sharon to track down her real father and also speculated that Gavin could be related to the character Dan Sullivan, who was played by Craig Fairbrass between 1999 and 2001 and was one of Phil's enemies. Gavin was confirmed to be Sharon's birth father in the episode broadcast on 30 October 2015, in which he repeated Sharon's adopted father Den Watts's (Leslie Grantham) iconic line \\"Hello, princess\\". Digital Spy Daniel Kilkelly said EastEnders had \\"delivered the daddy of all cliffhangers\\". Taylforth confirmed that her character Kathy is unaware of the connection between Sharon and Gavin, and said, always said that she would walk into a room and know straight away [when she meets her father], and especially when he said those words: 'Hello princess'. We had the full scripts for the episode, but the other cast members didn't know what was going on. Paul was just fantastic delivering that line.\\" Nicholas said that the \\"hello, princess\\" line was used because it was a definite way of linking Gavin and Den. Inside Soap said that Sharon discovering Gavin is her father \\"has to be the biggest [bombshell] of all\\" for Sharon, but added that viewers had already guessed before the episode was broadcast. Soaplife thought it was the \\"most shocking reveal\\" of 2015 in all British soap operas, saying they were \\"stunned\\". They also opined that Gavin seemingly genuinely wants to reconnect with Sharon and be a father to her and seems very fond of Dennis, and that if Sharon were to reject him, he would probably try to kidnap Dennis. Claudette Hubbard Gavin and Claudette (played by Ellen Thomas, pictured) In scenes broadcast in February and March 2016, Gavin blackmails Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas). The episodes are set on Mother's Day, which was called \\"the mother of all Mother's Days\\" by EastEnders. The Daily Mirror said that Gavin would get his comeuppance in the episodes and he would \\"meet his match\\" in Claudette, adding that \\"He may have destroyed Phil Mitchell's long-standing sobriety, but he won't get one over on the fearsome Claudette.\\" An EastEnders source explained that Gavin could \\"rip her family apart\\" and said, \\"Gavin is used to being the one who dishes out the pain‚Äîbut oh, how the tables have turned. Viewers will be on the edge of their seats waiting to find out if she has killed him.\\" They also said that \\"Claudette and Vincent's relationship will never be the same again\\" because of what has happened with Gavin. The Metro compared the scene where Claudette hits Gavin over the head with a candelabra to \\"a live-action version of Cluedo\\" calling Claudette \\"Miss Scarlett\\" and Gavin \\"Dr Black\\". Departure Gavin's final storyline sees him kidnapping Kathy, killing his sister Margaret Midhurst (Jan Harvey) and being arrested. Nicholas said of the storyline, \\"Gavin will be up to the usual sullied, nasty things\\", while Taylforth explained, \\"He is coming back to cause the usual mayhem that he always does. Paul is great playing a villain, we all love him to bits! He still controls Kathy in a certain way. She thought last time that she could control him ‚Äì as soon as starts talking to her, he wins her over again‚Äîas he always does!\\" The storyline includes a cliffhanger where it is not known if it is Margaret or Kathy who has been killed. Kilkelly said the end of the episode was a \\"sinister surprise\\" and that \\"Gavin Sullivan appeared to reach villainous new heights\\". Duncan Lindsay from the Metro said of Gavin, \\"He's clearly lost it and with a body on his hands and the control slipping from his grasp, there's no telling what Gavin might do next\\", adding that \\"The final chapter of the saga is about to unfold in dramatic fashion.\\" While promoting the storyline, Nicholas said he had enjoyed working on EastEnders but did not know if he would return again. Nicholas also said that Gavin is \\"trying to get [Kathy] back and he is trying to stay in control. He is very much how the mood takes him‚Äîwhether he tips over to being nice or being nasty. It could go very badly wrong\\". Following the episode on 5 July 2016 in which Gavin lures Kathy to his mansion under false pretences, Sarah Deen from the Metro said that Gavin \\"must have a head made of concrete\\" after surviving being hit on the head with a vase, and called the episode \\"tense and creepy\\" and like a \\"horror movie\\". Lindsay said that Gavin made a \\"shock exit\\" in the following episode, and said \\"he remained a villain to the very end.\\" Reception Nicholas's casting in the role was praised by All About Soap, who said, \\"We reckon this is ace casting‚Äîdoesn't he look like he belongs in Walford? We can just picture him in The Vic!\\" Frances Taylor, writing on BT Group website, said that Gavin's introduction \\"got the nation talking about EastEnders for all the right reasons\\". After the reveal that Gavin is Sharon's father, Inside Soap said, \\"Gavin cemented himself as Walford's Most Wicked when he subjected the Mitchells to the Halloween from hell. We've watched Kathy mither on about him for weeks, but the story only truly came to life when Gavin uttered the immortal wirds \\"'Ello Princess\\" to stunned daughter Sharon. Devilishly good.\\" Former EastEnders writer Sarah Phelps was initially angry that Den Watts's catchphrase had been given to Gavin, saying in a post on Twitter, \\"Never ever piss on the memory of Den and Angie. Never. I wrote that fking line [for Den's 2003 return]. That was Den. Not some turd in a syrup.\\" However, the following day she posted, \\"[To be honest] now I'm not pissed as a stoat, [I] think Gavin manipulating Sharon will be cruel & intriguing\\". In July 2016, actor Leslie Grantham, who played Den between 1985 and 1989 and again from 2003 to 2005, said \\"I do find it strange that the show gave Den's catchphrase to someone else. Den is still remembered and people still ask me to say, 'Ello princess', because it was one of those bits that made him so popular! You do feel like you own it when you've made such an impact. Obviously the show moves on and there's a whole new generation now, but I think that's pretty poor writing.\\" In February 2016, Laura-Jane Tyler from Inside Soap said, \\"We're in awe of Gavin's ability to glide in and out of Walford houses undetected, as if he's wearing a magical raincoat of invisibilty. He pops up all over the place! Is it because, like the shark he is, he needs to keep moving or else he'll die?\\" In June 2016, Sophie Dainty from Digital Spy included Gavin in a list of 10 soap opera villains she hoped would receive their comeuppance, opining that Gavin had not made \\"Archie Mitchell look like a care bear\\" as promised, adding that the fact that \\"he hasn't really done very much at all [...] leaves us feeling a little on edge\\", adding that \\"until he's humbled for good, we are fearful for those that have 'wronged' him.\\" In December 2016, when reviewing the whole of 2016 in EastEnders, Tyler from Inside Soap said that \\"anything to do with Gavin\\" was \\"what went wrong\\" in 2016.

E.g. rotational motion can be limited to rotation about only one axis, in contrast to a 3D liquid, where rotation of molecules about two or three axis would be possible. The same is true for the translational motion. The particles in 2D liquids can move in a 2D plane, whereas the particles is a 3D liquid can move in three directions inside the 3D volume.

The sauropodomorphs were the dominant terrestrial herbivores throughout much of the Mesozoic Era, from their origins in the mid- Triassic (approximately 230 Ma) until their decline and fall at the end of the Cretaceous (approximately 66 Ma).  Description  This new genus was described in the 23 June 2015 issue of 'Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society' in an essay titled 'A new basal sauropodiform from South Africa and the phylogenetic relationships of basal sauropodomorphs'. A portion of the left foot and four partial skeletons, including several pieces of spine and limbs, were excavated from the Elliot Formation in the late 1930s in the Zastron district in South Africa, some from the Lesotho border. Until a few years ago these formed part of the large fossil collection curated by the Evolutionary Studies Institute (ESI) at Wits University. When finally studied, the remains were thought to be those of the dinosaur Aardonyx. Further study determined that the remains represented a new dinosaur genus which was intermediate between early bipedal sauropodomorphs and the later giant quadruped sauropods, adding to the list of transitional sauropodomorphs from Argentina and South Africa, and further clarifying their diversification. A distinctive feature of this dinosaur is the cross-shaped astragalus or talus bone in its ankle. The generic name is derived from the Sesotho word sefapano, meaning ‚Äòcross‚Äô and the Greek word saurus, meaning 'lizard'. The specific name refers to Zastron, the type locality, where the specimen was discovered.

History First envisioned by the Northwest Arkansas Regional Planning Commission (NWARPC) during long-range planning that identified regional trails, the project came to fruition following the creation of a task force, public meetings, and coordination among NWA communities. Initially, the route was to follow three historically significant routes in NWA: the Butterfield Overland Mail route; Civil War routes; and the Trail of Tears in conjunction with the Arkansas Heritage Trails program. Funding A grant from the Walton Family Foundation in 2009 for up to $15 million ($ in current dollars) requiring 1-to-1 match from partner cities provided a revenue source for planning and design. The routing was also finalized during public meetings to serve many community attractions. A $15 million ($ in current dollars) Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration in 2010 assisted in right-of- way acquisition and construction of the project. The Arkansas State Highway Commission also provided $855,000 ($ in current dollars) to the project.

Between the 1806 and 1810 a grand new Eleja manor house was built here, which was burned down by the retreating Russian army in July 1915 and further demolished during the 1920-30s. Some efforts at renovating the manor house building complex and the arched stone fence started in 2015. During the German military occupation the Jelgava‚ÄìMeitene Railway was built through here, with a narrow-gauge railroad connection between Meitene and Bauska built in 1916. During this time a new village named VilkudƒÅrzs (Wolf's garden) started growing here. On 1932 the place was given the rights of village and on 1936 given its present name ‚Äì Eleja. From 1949 until 1956 it was the administrative center of the Eleja district. On February 21, 1950 it was named a worker's village; on 1961 elevated to the level of urban-type settlement, which it lost after 1990 territorial reform when Eleja and the surrounding Eleja country territory was united in a single parish. From 2009 included in the Jelgava municipality. Despite all the territorial changes, Eleja still is the center of the local area where the local administration, high school, kindergarten, library and community center are located. Latraps, one of Latvia's largest farmers co-operatives, has a production site here.Processing station of all agricultural products in Eleja External links * Eleja manor and park * Eleja parish website References Villages in Latvia ","title":"Eleja"},{"id":"47093805","text":"Oskar Pietsch (1918‚Äì2012) was a German art director.Kalat p.298 Selected filmography * Kein H√ºsung (1954) * Der Ochse von Kulm (1955) * The Captain from Cologne (1956) * Berlin, Schoenhauser Corner (1957) * My Wife Makes Music (1958) * Love's Confusion (1959) * Auf Wiedersehen (film) (1961) * The Invisible Dr. Mabuse (1962) References Bibliography * Kalat, David.

Life Heinrich Albert was born in W√ºrzburg and initially learned violin and horn, studying the latter at the K√∂nigliche Musikschule [Royal Music School] W√ºrzburg (1881‚Äì8). Following his studies he played in various orchestras in Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, and Russia. Between 1895 and 1900 he was a member of the Kaim Orchestra, the predecessor of the Munich Philharmonic, playing under such renowned conductors as Felix Weingartner, Arthur Nikisch, Ferdinand L√∂we, and Gustav Mahler.Detlev Bork, J√∂rg Jewanski: \\"Albert, Heinrich\\", in: Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart (MGG), supplement volume (Kassel: B√§renreiter, 2008), c. 8. Around 1892 he began to teach himself the guitar, aided, from about 1905, by Luigi Mozzani. His performing career, both as guitarist and as conductor of a mandolin orchestra, lasted from 1900 to 1943.Bork/Jewanski (2008), as above. In 1900 he began to establish himself as a full-time teacher of guitar and mandolin in Munich. Among his most prominent pupils were Luise Walker and the comedian Karl Valentin. In 1909, he was appointed \\"Kammervirtuose\\" [chamber virtuoso] by Marie of Bavaria. Around 1910, he founded a unique guitar quartet following the principles of the string quartet, using instruments in various sizes. Apart from his compositions and arrangements, Albert edited a number of guitar tutorials, notably the Moderner Lehrgang des k√ºnstlerischen Gitarrespiels (5 volumes, 1914‚Äì9). The increasing success of the Spanish approach to the guitar after 1920 seems to have frustrated him. The Hamburg-based Heinrich Albert Duo is named after him. In 2007, they issued a CD with the collected duos by Albert (see 'Selected recordings'). Music As a teacher, composer and editor of guitar music around 1900, Heinrich Albert's only \\"rival\\" in Europe was Francisco T√°rrega.Bork/Jewanski (2008), as above. In comparison to T√°rrega, Albert was more active in editing chamber music including the guitar, less so for solo guitar. He arranged and published 11 volumes of \\"Hausmusik\\" for flute or violin, viola and guitar and 23 volumes of Die Gitarre in der Haus- und Kammermusik vor 100 Jahren [The guitar in home and chamber music 100 years ago] (from 1918). Albert's 5-volume guitar method was unrivalled in German-speaking countries for several decades and have unjustly fallen into neglect, as several experts acknowledge their value to this day.Bork/Jewanski (2008), as above; also Libbert and Stevens, see Bibliography. As a composer, Albert was a Classicist, occasionally using a freer harmonic approach with an accessible degree of technical difficulty. Some of his music makes use of elements of Italian and Spanish folkmusic. His works were played by most major guitarists in the first half of the 20th century. He was then largely forgotten and has been rediscovered only after around 2000.

It is located in Eleja, Latvia. During its 19th-century heyday the manor house was part of a property that included a well-kept park, 19 buildings (a brewery, stables, a wind mill, brick and lime kilns) ponds and 1500 hectares of farmland and forests.

A wooden manor house was built by the Eleja river. After the death of Johann Friedrich von Tiesenhausen in 1716, the manor was inherited by his sister Amalie von Behr. After the death of Johann Ulrich von Behr (1716-1753), the manor was purchased in by the Count Johann Friedrich von Medem who paid 135 000 florins for it. He built a new Rococo style manor house here. His daughter's Dorothea von Medem's marriage to the Duke of Courland Peter von Biron in 1779 further elevated von Medems‚Äô standing among the local nobles. After the death of Johann in 1785, Eleja was inherited by his youngest son Christoph Johann von Medem. After many years of service in Kingdom of Prussia and Russian Empire, his attention returned to Eleja. In 1799 he married Maria Louise Elisabeth, daughter of Peter von der Pahlen, a favorite of emperor Paul I of Russia. After incorporation of Courland into the Russian empire, von Medems retained their properties and from 1806 until 1810 Christoph Johann von Medem built the Eleja manor house. The building was designed by the famous architect Giacomo Quarenghi and after some design changes built by Johann Georg Adam Berlitz in a neoclassical style. Eleja manor style was influential in building Me≈æotne Palace and Kazdanga palace, both of which survive to our days. After the death of Johann von Medem, Eleja was inherited by his oldest son Paul. After his death in 1854, Eleja was inherited by his brother Peter and in 1877 by his son Johann, who died in 1883 without leaving children. Eleja was inherited by Paul, who was the son of Christoph Johann von Medem's fourth son Theodore. Paul earned good money by raising horses and opening a brewery, which made him a profit of 100 000 roubles per year. The manor house and most of the surrounding buildings were burned down by the retreating Russian army in July 1915. Von Medems spent some summers in the guest wing that was the least damaged. Paul von Medem left Latvia forever in 1918 and in 1939 died in Germany. During the 1920 Latvia agrarian reform the 1586 ha of manor's land was divided among 150 farmers, and the main manor house buildings given to Eleja municipality. Medems were left with 50 ha of land and a servant's house, which they soon sold. Some of the remaining buildings were used as a school and theatre. During the late 1920s there were some ideas about restoring the manor house, but the project was financially unfeasible. In 1926 Eleja municipality had plans to restore the manor house, but soon changed its mind and in 1927 started to demolish it. To prevent this, on July 28, 1927 Eleja manor house was included in the list of state protected monuments. Due to the onset of the Great Depression neither municipality nor the state had money for renovations and on August 16, 1933 state allowed municipality to proceed with the demolition, however, not much was done besides reducing the brewery building from 5 floors to two and using the bricks for a new community center building. In 1954 Eleja manor house once again was included in the list of State protected monuments, but nothing was done to protect or conserve the ruins and they continued to crumble. Today only a few of the old buildings remain standing. EU funded efforts to renovate the tea house and the arched stone fence were started in 2015. In early 2016 this restoration was finished.Project: Restoration of Eleja Manor Premises References External links * Renovation of Eleja Tea house in Latvia * Eleja Manor Building with Park * Eleja manor and park * Photos of Elley Neoclassical architecture in Latvia Manor houses in Latvia Lime kilns in Latvia ","title":"Eleja manor house"},{"id":"47093930","text":"Spathius galinae is a parasitoid of emerald ash borer.

She was one of the best two-year-old fillies of her generation in France when she won the Prix Marcel Boussac on her third appearance. In the following season she finished third in the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches before winning the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot. She raced in the United States as a four-year-old, winning the Osunitas Handicap before being retired. Gold Splash was not a success as a broodmare, producing only two minor winners. Background Gold Splash was a small chestnut mare bred in Kentucky by Alan and Gerard Wertheimer. During her racing career she was owned by Alan and Gerard's father Jacques Wertheimer. She was sired by Blushing Groom, who won the Grand Crit√©rium in 1976 and the Poule d'Essai des Poulains in 1977 before becoming a very successful breeding stallion. His progeny included Arazi, Blushing John, Nashwan, Rahy, Rainbow Quest and Snow Bride. Gold Splash's dam, Riviere d'Or was a top-class performer who won the Prix Saint-Alary in 1988, and was a daughter of the outstanding racemare Gold River, the winner of the 1981 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. A year after foaling Gold Splash, Riviere d'Or produced Born Gold, the dam of Goldikova. Gold Splash was initially sent into training with Criquette Head at Chantilly. Racing career 1992: two-year-old season Gold Splash began her racing her career in the listed Prix Yacowlef over 1200 metres at Deauville Racecourse on 1 August and finished second by a short neck to Wixon, with Lit de Justice (later to win the Breeders' Cup Sprint) in fourth. After finishing fourth to Dancienne at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse in September the filly was moved up to the highest class for the Group One Prix Marcel Boussac over 1600 metres on soft ground at Longchamp Racecourse on 4 October. Her ten opponents included Kindergarten (Prix d'Aumale), Cox Orange (Prix du Calvados), the British challengers Marillette (May Hill Stakes) and Love of Silver (Prestige Stakes) and the Italian-trained Secrage (Prix de Cabourg). Ridden by Gerald Mosse she raced in second place before taking the lead in the straight and held off the late challenge of Kindergarten to win by a short neck, with Love of Silver three-quarters of a length away in third. 1993: three-year-old season On her first appearance as a three-year-old Gold Splash finished second to the Andr√© Fabre-trained favourite Baya in the roup Three Prix de la Grotte over 1600 metres at Longchamp on 15 April. A month later she started 3.7/1 second favourite behind Baya for the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches over the same course and distance. Ridden as in her previous race by Olivier Doleuze she took the lead 400 metres from the finish and in a closely contested four-way struggle she finished third behind Madeleine's Dream and Ski Paradise, just ahead of Baya in fourth. Mosse regained the ride when Gold Splash was sent to England to contest the 144th renewal of the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot on 16 June. She was made the 100/30 second favourite behind Nicer, the Geoff Wragg-trained winner of the Irish 1000 Guineas. The other three runners were the Andr√© Fabre-trained Elizabeth Bay (winner of the Prix Eclipse), Sumoto (winner of her only previous race) and Zarani Sidi Anna (runner-up in the Nell Gwyn Stakes). Gold Splash tracked the leader Zarani Sidi Anna before taking the lead entering the final furlong. She held off a challenge from Elizabeth Bay to win by a neck, with Zarani Sidi Anna finishing three quarters of a length away in third. After the race Criuette Head paid tribute to her father Alec Head who had won the race twice in the 1950s saying \\"It's a shame papa is not here, I could not have had a better teacher\\" and said of Gold Splash \\"She's a small filly but she's got a heart as big as this\\", reportedly spreading her hands \\"wide enough to accommodate a volleyball\\". On her next appearance, Gold Splash was matched against colts and older horses in the Prix Jacques Le Marois at Deauville in August and finished fifth behind Sayyedati, Ski Paradise, Kingmambo and Elizabeth Bay. In September she finished sixth behind Kingmambo in the Prix du Moulin at Longchamp. In October, Gold Splash was dropped in class and started favourite for the Group Two Prix du Rond Point at Longchamp. After turning into the straight in third place she faded to finish eighth of the ten runners behind the four-year-old colt Voleris. 1994: four-year-old season In 1994, Gold Splash was transferred to the United States where she was trained by Richard Mandella. On her American debut she dead-heated for third place in the Convenience Handicap at Hollywood Park on 21 May. After a three-month break she returned for the Osunitas Handicap at Del Mar, in which she carried top weight of 121 pounds against five opponents. Ridden by Corey Nakatani, she came from last place approaching the final turn to take the lead in the straight and won by three quarters of a length from Queens Court Queen. In her two remaining starts she finished fourth behind Skimble at Louisiana Downs in September and fourth again behind the same mare in the Grade II Dahlia Handicap at Hollywood Park in December. Breeding record After her retirement from racing, Gold Splash became a broodmare for Wertheimer & Frere. She produced at least six foals and two minor winners between 1996 and 2005: *Ziggy Gold, a bay colt, sired in 1996, sired by Danzig.

Some modern audiences consider it racist and offensive due to its exaggerated stereotypes. Although a similar depiction was displayed within J. M. Barrie's original play, later adaptations have reimagined the Natives, while the Disney version‚Äîand this song in particular‚Äîwere said to have \\"doubled-down on racial stereotypes\\". It has been compared to the song \\"Savages\\" from the 1995 Disney film Pocahontas, which contains negative lyrics regarding Native Americans; in contrast with \\"What Makes the Red Man Red?\\", however, the offensive lyrics in \\"Savages\\" were written purposely, as they are sung by the villains of the movie, in order to illustrate the message that racism is wrong. Production Jonathan \\"Candy\\" Candido, who played the role of the Chief in Peter Pan, said the following in an interview with MousePlanet: Context Peter Pan and Wendy come across the Indians (who refer to themselves as \\"Injuns\\") once arriving in Neverland. Wishing to learn more about them, the Lost Boys ask the Indians three questions: \\"What Makes the Red Man Red?\\", \\"When Did He First Say 'Ugg'?\\" and \\"Why Does He Ask You 'How?'\\" This song is performed by \\"the big-nosed, guttural Chief character\\" accompanied by his tribesmen. The Indians pass the peace pipe to the children as they tell their tale. Composition Writer Kim McLarin of NPR describes it as a \\"bouncy, drum-heavy song\\", while the Best of Disney calls it a \\"labored routine\\". Contemporary reception Complex notes that in the 21st century, \\"you can't just ask people 'What Makes the Red Man Red?, and comments on the Lost Boys' musical number: \\"Jeez, you racist little monsters, no wonder you're orphans.\\" Althouse said the song has \\"obvious political correctness problems\\". AllDay notes that \\"the one time they break into song\\" is the only time the Native Americans do not speak in broken English throughout the film. In the article \\"Caught on Film: The Racist Ghosts of Disney's Past\\", DivineCaroline writes \\"The best part of the song is when the singers say that their version is the right one, 'no matter what's been written or said'.\\" Bustle deems the song a \\"big ol' pile of racism\\". MediaDiversed says the \\"horror that was the song\\" serves to reinforce stereotypes and racist attitudes. The site Great Indian Moments From Pop Culture calls the \\"insipid tune\\" the \\"worst\\" of the \\"troublesome Native stereotypes\\" in Disney's Peter Pan. It notes that \\"the chorus, with its 'nonsense' words, simply reduces indigenous languages (and semantics) to sheer gibberish\\". The Guardian writes that the song is \\"exactly as alarming to modern eyes and ears as its title suggests\\". Minnesota Playlist argues that this \\"infamous\\" number \\"upped the racist ante\\". RantLifestyle notes that \\"the chief ... is a walking stereotype\\", and sums up their view of the song by saying \\"Oh dear\\". David Martinez, author of American Indians and Film, writes, \\"My jaw hit the ground when I heard this song and saw these 'redskins' hopping around and making fools of themselves. Granted it was only a cartoon, but it was one in which the animators took the liberty of demeaning an entire race in the name of entertainment.\\" The rapper Narcycist references the song in an article about the use of subtle racism in film. The Hollywood Reporter calls the song \\"infamous\\". Sasha Houston Brown, Santee Sioux tribe member and adviser to the American Indian Success Program at Minneapolis Community and Technical College, says about the scene: \\"I remember seeing it and not having the skills to understand why it made me feel embarrassed. What does that do to a child's formation of identity, even if it's subliminal and subconscious? The message is, 'You're not human. You're a trend. You're something that can be commodified and bought and sold. An opinion article at The Daily Revelle notes the problem of depicting Native Americans in this way: \\"Disney has always been there to teach proper morals ... from an early start, Americans are fed these ideas, and the topic is never properly taught to correct them ... If you're teaching American history, put the time and effort into respectfully educating others on the extraordinary people that were here first.\\" TOR argues that the \\"cartoon war dance\\" and song go even further than Barrie's play by \\"stat[ing] that the Indians are not just savages, but sexist savages, who force Wendy to go fetch firewood while the other boys have fun\\". Wired says the \\"really awkward scene\\" features a \\"thoroughly appalling song, arguably more racist than anything in the notorious Song of the South\\". The blog Racial Stereotyping notes, \\"Not only does this video stereotype Native Americans but it also stereotypes women\\". Banon's Roar writes, \\"Watching now its [sic] cringe inducing. Every line is some kind of gag about how their skin is red and they make weird noises. Compare it even to the Crows from Dumbo. They were timely caricatures as well, but their jokes were not aimed at humiliating themselves.\\" LeapToad says, \\"If any other ethnic group were treated this way, this film would have quietly disappeared, much like Song of the South has.\\" Though Hollywood.com names the 1953 film version as the third best Peter Pan adaption, it recommends that viewers \\"forget that whole 'What Made the Red Man Red?' part, for obvious reasons\\". Greg Ehrbar of Mouse Tracks says the song \\"veers precariously into politically incorrect territory\\". Marc Davis, one of the supervising animators of the 1953 film, said in an interview years after the production, \\"I'm not sure we would have done the Indians if we were making this movie now. And if we had we wouldn't do them the way we did back then...The Indians were Ward Kimball‚Äôs stuff. Beautifully done. The Indians could not have been done that way nowadays. I like them. Very funny. Very entertaining, especially the big Chief.\\" Disney historian Jim Korkis stated that \\"...Peter Pan was supposed to represent a young boy‚Äôs impression of pirates, mermaids and Indians... these fanciful creations bore more of a relation to popular culture storybooks than reality.\\" Legacy When the film has been syndicated on television, the native scene has often been removed. In the 1954 stage musical, a blond actress named Sondra Lee was cast as the Native American character Tiger Lily to perform \\"Ugg-a-Wugg\\", \\"a drum number of caricatured dance moves and lyrics of inarticulate babble\\". Because of the perceived racial insensitivity of the characters and this song in particular by the time the film Return to Never Land was released in theatres in 2002, the Indians were not featured as characters in that movie. During production of the 2015 Warner Bros. live-action film Pan, the film's developers made a deliberate choice to distance the character of Tiger Lily and her people from Native American heritage and reimagine them as lacking any particular ethnicity, in order to \\"avoid the racial insensitivities of ... Disney's 1953 animated film, which infamously featured the song 'What Made the Red Man Red? The song is sampled in the Frank Waln song of the same title, in which he raps about the legacy of genocide and colonialism and criticizes the original song for its supposed racism.

Two rebellious lords kidnapped him in 1274 in an attempt to play him off against his brother, Ladislaus IV of Hungary, but the king's supporters liberated him. He was styled \\"Duke of Slavonia and Croatia\\" in a 1274 letter. Years after his death (in 1290 and in 1317), two adventurers claimed to be identical with Andrew, but both failed.  Family  Andrew was born in 1268. He was the second son (and youngest child) of Stephen V, the junior king of Hungary at the time of Andrew's birth. The senior king was Andrew's grandfather B√©la IV. Andrew's mother was Stephen's wife, Elizabeth the Cuman. Andrew's father, Stephen, became the sole King of Hungary in 1270, but died two years later. Stephen was succeeded by his elder son (Andrew's ten-year-old brother) Ladislaus IV. In theory, Ladislaus's ruled under the regency of his mother, Elizabeth, but in fact, competing parties of the most wealthy noble families, including the Cs√°ks and K≈ëszegis, were fighting against each other for the control of government.  Duke of Slavonia  Henry K≈ëszegi, the Ban of Slavonia, and his ally, Joachim Gutkeled, the Master of the treasury, who had earlier held Ladislaus IV in captivity, kidnapped the six-year-old Andrew in July 1274, taking him to Slavonia in an attempt to play him off against his brother. However, K≈ëszegi's and Gutkeled's rival, Peter Cs√°k, and his allies annihilated their united troops in late September and liberated Andrew. In a letter dated to the end of 1274, Andrew is mentioned as \\"Duke of Slavonia and Croatia\\", but otherwise he was only referred to as \\"Duke Andrew\\". According to a scholarly theory, the former title was only used to emphasize that Andrew was the lawful heir to his 12-year-old elder brother at the time the letter, which referred to a planned marriage between Andrew and a relative of Rudolf I of Germany, was written. Andrew died at the age of ten between 6 April and 6 November 1278.  Two false Andrews  Andrew's childless brother, Ladislaus IV was murdered on 10 July 1290. His distant relative, Andrew III, succeeded him and was crowned king on 23 July. However, an adventurer announced that he was identical with King Ladislaus's younger brother, claiming Hungary to himself against Andrew III. Through showing his specific birthmark, the impostor even convinced Stephen V's sisterthe late Duke Andrew's auntKinga, wife of Boles≈Çaw V the Chaste, Duke of Cracow. The false Duke Andrew invaded Hungary from Poland, but King Andrew's commander, George Baksa routed his troop, forcing him to return to Poland before 18 November. The pretender was in short killed by his Hungarian retainers. In 1317, a new adventurer declared himself Duke Andrew, on this occasion in Majorca. He and his imprisonment was mentioned in the correspondence between Sancho, King of Majorca, and Robert, King of Naples who was the uncle of Charles I of Hungary. The second false Duke Andrew's further fate is unknown.

One of the several groups involved in the \\"Bosstown Sound\\", a commercial ploy designed to compete with the San Francisco Sound, the band developed a blend of psychedelia, blues rock, and hard rock, which was exemplified and expanded upon on their two albums. The group went through several line-up changes before disbanding in 1970. History The band originated from the garage rock outfit C. C. and the Chasers, who became the house band at the Unicorn Coffeehouse in Boston and released an obscure single, \\"Put the Clock Back on the Wall\\", for the small Cori label in 1964. The first line-up consisted of Ted Demos (lead guitar), Joe Castagno (rhythm guitar), Richard Barnaby (bass guitar), Jeff Labes (keyboards), and Jack Bruno (drums), all of whom shared vocals duties. After briefly relocating to New York City in 1965, the group adopted the moniker Sacred Mushroom, and dwelled in psychedelic music. They again became a house band, this time for the Bitter End Cafe, and supported musical acts such as Neil Young and Joni Mitchell. The band recruited female singer Anne Tansey, whom Labes described as \\"a powerhouse, kind of a Janis Joplin with a sweeter voice, but sultry dynamic energy.\\" Her connections in the music industry were responsible for finding their manager, Marv Lagunoff, and for the group's signing to a record label. As a deal with Atlantic Records was pending, the name Sacred Mushroom was deemed too drug-oriented, and, after a humorous remark by Demos, the band was prompted to change it to Apple Pie Motherhood Band in 1967. The group recorded their first single, \\"Long Live Apple Pie\\", with Felix Pappalardi, who is perhaps best known for his work with the psychedelic rock band Cream. Though the single did not break the national charts, it did receive extensive airplay by DJ Dick Summer on Boston's WBZ Radio, as well as on several alternative- music stations just beginning to emerge across the US. The band proceeded to record their debut album, which in one instance was interrupted by Tansey's friend, Jimi Hendrix, who taught and played with the band in jam sessions. However, Tansey soon departed the band and was replaced by Marilyn Lundquist, who performed backing vocals on her co-written composition, \\"Ice\\", and a baroque version of David Blue's song, \\"I'd Like to Know\\". In some way, all the band members had a share in the writing credits, but Labes composed the majority of the original material. He explained, \\"I had been writing songs for several years at that point, and found it easy to create appropriate songs for the band. We sounded more like the energy of an East Coast version of what was up in San Francisco at that time.\\" The resulting album, The Apple Pie Motherhood Band, was released in 1968, and mixed extended instrumentals, heavy blues rock, influences of psychedelia and vocal harmonies, and became somewhat of an underground favorite in Boston. Apple Pie Motherhood Band spent the large portion of 1968 performing in the Greenwich Village and Chicago, opening for musical acts such as Jefferson Airplane, Paul Butterfield Blues Band, and The Chambers Brothers. All the while, the group experienced a set of line-up changes, first with Lundquist leaving and Castagno departing, citing an inability to travel for gigs. The band recruited singer Bruce Paine along with guitarist Michael Sorafine and harmonica player Adam Myers. Paine previously worked as a folk singer, but after contractual issues with RCA Records' development of his own album, he was encouraged to join the band. Sorafine and Myers were added in Chicago while the group was performing at the Rush Club, with the latter of the two introducing the members to LSD. When it came time for the group to record for their second album, Apple Pie, the LSD was negatively affecting the sessions, and, consequently, there was a lack of written material. Though Labes composed the majority of original songs, he only penned one track, \\"Super Music Man\\", with the rest evenly formulated from the other band members. It was more derived from psychedelic rock, but still contained R&B-flavored; cover versions of \\"I Just Want to Make Love to You\\", \\"Get Ready\\", and \\"Brown Eyed Handsome Man\\". However, Apple Pie's 1969 release was delayed after their manager disagreed with the group's relocation to a communal farm in Vermont; and, as a result, the band disbanded in the summer of that year to play in the counterculture musical production Hair.

Between 1952 and 1957 he was the rector of Berlin's Humboldt University. Life Early years Walther Eduard Hermann Neye was born, the youngest of three children, at the start of the twentieth century in Arnsberg, a prosperous mid-sized town in central western Germany. His father was a company secretary. Neye successfully completed his school leaving exams in Potsdam in 1919. After that, during the confused year of political and social turbulence that for Germany followed national defeat in the First World War, he briefly joined the \\"Upper Silesian Border Force\\" ('), a freelance quasi-military body set up by the Council of the People's Deputies (interim government) to guard Germany's south-eastern border with the newly re-created Polish state in a region where many districts were of mixed ethnicity and national identity. In autumn 1919 he returned to Berlin and started a period of legal study at the Frederick William University (as the Humboldt was then known), graduating successfully in 1923. In 1924 he received his doctorate ' from Breslau University, obtaining in 1927 a referendary post through passing a further public examination. During his time as a referendary, which lasted until 1935, he also worked as a repetitor. Professional life before and during the war In 1928 Neye started to work as a lawyer in Berlin. Five years later, in January 1933, there was a change of regime. The Hitler government lost little time in switching Germany over to single-party dictatorship. Shortly after that, in May 1933, Walther Neye signed up for party membership, also joining the National Socialist Association of Legal Professionals. In June 1938 he was nominated as a notary to the Charlottenburg (Berlin) District Court. In summer 1938 Neye faced official censure from the legal regulator because he had sold a piece of land to a Jewish woman, which was by now contrary to government policy. The record of the incident was retained in the files kept by the president of the district court. Despite this, from 1939 the assessments kept about him on file by the district court president were very positive. War returned towards the end of 1939. Neye entered into a contract with the Aviation Ministry, after which he worked as a consultant in the aviation sector. However, from October 1941 until November 1942 he also resumed his work as a public notary. In November 1942 he was ordered to the Netherlands, which by this time had been under German occupation for more than two years. He was installed in Eindhoven where he was inserted into the management team controlling physical assets of the important Philips electronics corporation that the family had not managed to move across the Atlantic ahead of the German invasion. In September 1944 he was removed from Philips when Einhoven was liberated from German forces by allied forces. After the war War ended in May 1945, with the eastern part of Berlin now incorporated into the Soviet occupation zone in what remained of Germany. Neye managed to persuade the magistrate of greater Berlin that he had never been a member of the Nazi Party and in June 1945 was readmitted to the legal profession in the city. In July 1945 he resumed his office as public notary, with which he continued until 1947. At the end of summer 1946 Neye also took a teaching post in civil law at the Humboldt University. As part of the recruitment process, he had been required to provide a sworn statement that he had not been a party member, and had always been critical of the Hitler regime. For the Dean of the Law faculty, , Neye's experience as a repetitor during the early 1930s, counted decisively in favour of his appointment. Sources stress that Neye's mid-career switch into the academic world was facilitated by a desperate shortage of academic staff generated by the slaughter of war and, at least in the case of the law faculty at the Humboldt, exacerbated in the zone under Soviet administration by rigorous de-nazification processes that excluded many potential candidates. Neye was therefore able to become a full professor at the university without ever obtaining a higher habilitation qualification. After October 1949, when the Soviet occupation zone was reinvented as the German Democratic Republic, an unusual and increasingly apparent feature of the new country's political structure was the extent to which political and administrative control was centrally directed. An early manifestation of this trend in the education sector was the creation, in 1945, of the German National People's Training Administration (DVV / '). In 1947 this body nominated Neye to a full professorship of civil law at the University of Rostock.

His career encompassed the design and development of flying boats before the Second World War to rocket powered fighters after. He had a significant role in Britain‚Äôs first indigenous rocket project (Black Knight) and in the development of practical hovercraft (SR.N1) Career Maurice Brennan was born in April 1913, at Muswell Hill, London. He was educated in Scotland, first at St. Mungo's Academy then at Glasgow University. He qualified for his pilots \\"A\\" licence in 1931. After graduating from Glasgow in April 1934, he joined the technical office of Hawker Aircraft, Ltd in Kingston, where he remained until 1936, when he went to work for Saunders-Roe. At Saunders-Roe he was engaged in the stress office, the aerodynamics office and the project office. In this period his design responsibilities included the Saro Lerwick and the Short Shetland flying boats. From 1947, he was technical assistant to the chief executive, Sir Arthur Gouge. In January 1947 Brennan took charge of helicopter development when Saunders-Roe took over the development contract on the Cierva W.14 Skeeter and Cierva Air Horse helicopters. He became chief designer in October 1953, and among his responsibilities were the Saunders Roe Princess flying boat, the SR.53 and SR.177 mixed (rocket and jet)-powered interceptor fighters and the Black Knight programme. He also led the detail design of the SR.N1 hovercraft, working closely with Christopher Cockerell. He resigned from Saunders-Roe in March 1959 to work for Vickers Armstrong in Weybridge. This was three days after the chief rocket development engineer, Mr Paul Layton, resigned \\"as a protest against Britain's lack of a space exploration policy\\", although Brennan said at the time his resignation was unconnected with Layton's. At Vickers Armstrong he was the assistant chief engineer working with Barnes Wallis on variable-geometry aircraft projects that would eventually become the basis of the AFVG project. However, he resigned again after ten months, joining Folland in 1960, replacing Teddy Petter as director and chief engineer. By this time Folland was part of Hawker Siddeley, and he was responsible for developing the two-seat Gnat T.1, various twin engined and variable wing geometry Gnat proposals and the GERM hovercraft project (Ground Effect Research Machine). In 1961 he moved to Avro (also part of Hawker Siddeley) succeeding Roy Ewans as a director and chief engineer. From 1961-1969 his responsibilities included the Avro 748, its derivative the Hawker Siddeley Andover and the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod. Later Brennan became director of special projects with responsibility for V/STOL military and civil designs. In the late 1970s and early 1980s he was Technical Director of Aircraft Designs with Sheriff Aerospace. He died in 1986 on the Isle of Wight.

History Early history It was founded in 1973 by Bill Wilson, who was a Santa Clara councilman and mayor from 1963‚Äì1971. Wilson assisted in founding a counseling center for children at Buchser Middle School. Initially called Webster's Education Center when the institutors were attempting to determine the organization's name, it was renamed to the Bill Wilson Center after his unexpected death in 1977 in his early 40s. In 1977, the center obtained a house that acted as a shelter for at most six homeless youth. The Bill Wilson Center's director is Sparky Harlan. She joined the organization as its director in 1983, taking a salary cut. When she joined, the organization faced an imminent loss of 50% of its annual $300,000 budget; she was able to prevent the budget cut. In July 1993, she moved the center to The Alameda in Santa Clara, which unified its shelter and counseling center to be in the same location. The move also expanded its capacity from being able to house at most 16 homeless children, up from six. In 2012, the White House Office of Public Engagement and Intergovernmental Affairs named Harlan a Champion of Change, an award given to people who help homeless children. According to the San Jose Mercury News, the Bill Wilson Center was the first organization in the Santa Clara Valley to \\"provide comprehensive services -- including transitional housing -- for this often-invisible population\\" of homeless youth. The organization receives most of its funding from government grants. Since it is uncertain whether the funds will be maintained or augmented to address the children's growing needs, the Bill Wilson Center solicits donations from people and corporations. 2000s In 2012, the Bill Wilson Center finished developing Peacock Commons, a two-story, 28-unit housing complex for homeless young adults between 18 and 25. It bought the complex in 2007 and began renovating it in February 2012. Residents began moving into Peacock Commons in April 2012. Rent is subsidized by Santa Clara County Mental Health and paid on a sliding scale. On May 23, 2012, Santa Clara County Mental Health Board gave the Bill Wilson Center a Community Service Award. In 2014, the organization helped 3,512 people. During meals, caseworkers meet with the youths and counsel them on various topics like resumes and drug addictions. Between 80% to 89% of the people they helped in 2014 were able to rejoin their families or move into stable housing.

The Parliament of Las Canoas () was a diplomatic meeting between Mapuche-Huilliches and Spanish authorities in 1793 held at the confluence of Rahue River and Damas River near what is today the city of Osorno. The parliament was summoned by the Royal Governor of Chile Ambrosio O'Higgins after the Spanish had suppressed an uprising by the Mapuche-Huilliches of Ranco and R√≠o Bueno in 1792. The parliament is historically relevant since the treaty signed at the end of the meeting allowed the Spanish to reestablish the city of Osorno and secure the transit rights between Valdivia and the Spanish mainland settlements near Chilo√© Archipelago. The indigenous signatories recognized the king of Spain as their sovereign but they kept considerable autonomy in the lands they did not ceded. The treaty is unique in that it was the first time Mapuches formally ceded territory to the Spanish. The caciques summoned by the Spanish to the parliament where those whose lands were to affected by the Spanish proposal. The caciques Juan Queipul and Jos√© Antitipay, who belonged to the area, were not present at the parliament since they were in Santiago where they held a small parliament with Ambrosio O'Higgins in person. The issues to be dealt with were the same as in Las Canoas. Background Beginning in the mid-18th century the Spanish enclave of Valdivia begun a period of agricultural expansion. The expansion, that mainly directed to the south, was done mostly by pacific means, but hostilities with indigenous Huilliches did occur. The expansion of Valdivia included a process of mestization and the purchasing of indigenous lands by criollos and transformation of previous indigenous proprietors into inquilinos. In contrast the Spanish settlement at Chilo√© Archipelago had a history of conflicts with the indigenous peoples north of the archipelago. After the Valdivian colonization had reached Bueno River Spanish authorities pushed for connecting the city of Valdivia with the settlements at Chacao Channel by a road. This way the Spanish authorities hoped to make its possible for Valdivia and Chilo√© to offer each other mutual aid in the case of an invasion by a European power.

The series began with the release of Demon's Souls for the PlayStation 3 in 2009, and was followed by Dark Souls and its sequels, Dark Souls II and Dark Souls III, in the 2010s. The series' creator, Hidetaka Miyazaki, served as director for each of them with the exceptions of Dark Souls II and the externally developed Demon's Souls remake. The Souls games are played in a third-person perspective, and focus on exploring interconnected environments while fighting enemies with weapons and magic. Players battle bosses to progress through the story, while interacting with strange non-playable characters. The series has been both praised and criticized for its high level of game difficulty. Other FromSoftware games such as King's Field, Bloodborne, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and Elden Ring share several related concepts. By 2020, the series had sold over 27 million copies. Setting The games take place within a dark, medieval fantasy setting, where the player's character fights against knights, dragons, phantoms, and demons and other entities monstrous or supernatural. The accretion, loss, and recovery of souls is central to the narrative and gameplay of Souls games. Another recurring motif is that of a once powerful and prosperous kingdom which has fallen into ruin: for example the setting of Demon's Souls, Boletaria, in which the player attempts to halt the spread of a demon-infested fog that threatens to consume the world. The plot of the Dark Souls trilogy differs in that it revolves around the player's attempts, through various means, to either reverse or perpetuate the spread of a curse of undeath known as the \\"Darksign\\" - which prevents true death but prompts the undead's gradual descent into a madness and decay called \\"Hollowing\\" - based on the player's decisions. These games are linked through their setting and an overarching cyclic narrative centering around fire, and are linked to their predecessor Demon's Souls through common themes and elements including interactions with phantoms and battles with demons. At the end of each game, characters may reignite the \\"first flame\\" or allow it to fade, recurring a choice others have made before, which eventually becomes a plot point in itself. Gameplay The protagonist of each Souls game can have a varying gender, appearance, name, and starting class via character creation. Players can choose between classes, including knights, barbarians, thieves, and mages. Each class has its own starting equipment and abilities that can be tailored to the player's experience and choices as they progress. The player gains souls from gameplay battles which act as both experience points to level up and as currency to buy items. Souls gained are usually proportional to the difficulty of fighting certain enemies; the more difficult an enemy, the more souls the player will gain. One of the core mechanics of the series is that it uses death to teach players how to react in hostile environments, encouraging repetition, learning from past mistakes, and prior experience as a means of overcoming its difficulty. Upon losing all of their health points and dying, players lose their Souls and are teleported back to a bonfire where they last rested, which serves as a checkpoint. One chance is given for the player to recover their lost Souls in the form of a bloodstain, which is placed at or around where they last died. If the player dies again before reaching their bloodstain, the Souls are permanently gone. As most enemies are respawned following player death, or if the player should rest at a bonfire, the player has the opportunity to regain more Souls by repeated combat encounters. The bonfire is a type of campfire in the action role-playing game Dark Souls and its sequels that functions as a checkpoint for the player character's progress, as well as reviving most enemies that the player previously killed. Later in the game, and in Dark Souls II and III, they function as warp points. Another core aspect of the Souls games is its dependency on endurance in battle. Performing attacks, blocking, or dodging consume stamina, which otherwise quickly restores if the player stands still or just walks around. Certain moves cannot be executed if the player lacks a certain amount of stamina, making them vulnerable to attack. Players must balance their rate of attacks against defensive moves and brief periods of rest to survive more difficult encounters. Online interaction in the Souls games is integrated into the single-player experience. Throughout levels, players can briefly see the actions of other players as ghosts in the same area that may show hidden passages or switches. When a player dies, a bloodstain can be left in other players' game world that when activated can show a ghost playing out their final moments, indicating how that person died and potentially helping the player avoid the same fate in advance. Players can leave messages on the ground that can either help other players by providing hints and warnings or harm them by leaving false hints. Players can also engage in both player versus player combat and cooperative gameplay using invasion or summoning mechanics. Games Demon's Souls Released in 2009 for PlayStation 3, Demon's Souls is the first game in the Souls series. It has also been described as a spiritual successor to the King's Field series of games, while at the same time being described as a separate entity \\"guided by differing core game design concepts.\\" It also drew inspiration from video games such as Ico,Bloodborne Creator Describes Influences and Game Design History , IGN The Legend of Zelda, as well as manga such as Berserk and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. Demon's Souls takes place in the fictional kingdom of Boletaria, which is being ravaged by a cursed fog that brings forth demons who feast on the souls of mortals. Unlike its successors, Demon's Souls uses a central hub system known as the \\"Nexus\\" where players can level up, repair equipment, or buy certain items, before venturing into one of the five connected worlds. The \\"World Tendency\\" feature is also exclusive to Demon's Souls, where the difficulty of exploring a world is dependent on how many bosses have been killed, and how the player dies. The gameplay involves a character-creation system and emphasizes gathering loot through combat with enemies in a non- linear series of varied locations. It had an online multiplayer system integrated into single-player, in which players could leave messages and warnings for other players' worlds, as well as join other players to assist and/or kill them. The multiplayer servers were shut down in early 2018 due to inactivity. A remake by Bluepoint Games will be released for the PlayStation 5 in November 2020. =Remake= In 2016, Miyazaki acknowledged the demand for a Demon's Souls remake, but said he was personally not interested in working on such a project, adding that he was instead open to the possibility for an external company to do so, provided that they loved the original and devoted themselves to it. In June 2020, a remake of the game by Bluepoint Games was announced for release as a launch title on the PlayStation 5 in November 2020. Dark Souls Dark Souls is the second game in the Souls series, and considered a spiritual successor to Demon's Souls. From Software wanted to craft games similar to Demon's Souls but the exclusivity of the IP to Sony prevented them from using the same name on other platforms. Instead, From Software crafted a new intellectual property to be published on multiple consoles. It was released in 2011 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. In 2012, Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360, featuring the base game and the Artorias of the Abyss downloadable content. The game takes place in the fictional kingdom of Lordran. Players assume the role of a cursed human character who sets out to discover the fate of undead humans like themselves. The plot of Dark Souls is primarily told through environmental details, in-game item flavor text, and dialogue with non-playable characters (NPCs). Players must piece together clues in order to understand the story, rather than being told the story through more traditional means, such as through cutscenes. Dark Souls and its predecessor Demon's Souls garnered recognition due to the series' high level of difficulty.Houghton, David.

A remaster of the game, Dark Souls: Remastered, was released in May 2018. Dark Souls II Dark Souls II is the third installment in the Souls series. Unlike the previous two games, director Hidetaka Miyazaki did not reprise his role as he was busy directing Bloodborne, although he was still involved in supervision. It was released in 2014 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. In 2015, an updated version featuring The Lost Crowns downloadable content was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, under the title Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin  with the latter two platforms receiving retail releases. The game takes place in the fictional kingdom of Drangleic, where the player must find a cure for the undead curse. Although set in the same universe as the previous game, there is no direct story connection to Dark Souls. Dark Souls III Dark Souls III was announced at E3 2015. It was released in Japan on March 24, 2016, and worldwide on April 12, 2016, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. The gameplay is paced faster than previous Souls installments, which was attributed in part to the gameplay of Bloodborne.. In 2017, the complete version containing the base game and both expansions (Ashes of Ariendel and The Ringed City) was released, under the title Dark Souls III: The Fire Fades. Dark Souls III was both critically and commercially successful, with critics calling it a worthy and fitting conclusion to the series. It was the fastest-selling game in Bandai Namco's history, selling over 10 million copies by 2020. In an interview promoting Dark Souls III, Miyazaki was asked how he felt about the current number of Souls games. He responded by saying, \\"I don't think it'd be the right choice to continue indefinitely creating Souls and Bloodborne games. I'm considering Dark Souls 3 to be the big closure on the series. That's not just limited to me, but From Software and myself together want to aggressively make new things in the future... I believe that From Software has to create new things. There will be new types of games coming from us, and Dark Souls 3 is an important marker in the evolution of From Software.\\" In April 2016, it was reported that Miyazaki and FromSoftware had begun working on a new intellectual property (Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice), and had no current plans to continue the Souls series with sequels or spin-offs. Related games In February 2016, Bandai Namco Entertainment partnered with American retailer GameStop to release Slashy Souls, a free-to-play mobile endless runner, to promote Dark Souls III. The game was presented in a pixel art style, and shares the series' level of difficulty. The game was met with highly negative critical reception, with reviewers such as Chris Carter of Destructoid and Jim Sterling both giving the game a 1/10. The King's Field series, also developed by FromSoftware, is considered a spiritual predecessor to the Souls series. It debuted in 1994 for the PlayStation with King's Field and had three sequels in addition to other spinoffs. Other FromSoftware games directed by Miyazaki, such as Bloodborne, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and Elden Ring, share many of the same concepts of Souls and are often associated with the series despite being their own intellectual properties, with fans and journalists often grouping the games under the \\"Soulsborne\\" branding. Reception The Souls series has been met with critical acclaim. Demon's Souls won several awards, including \\"Best New IP\\" from GameTrailers, and overall Game of the Year from GameSpot. Former SIE president Shuhei Yoshida later regretted not publishing the game in the west, doubting how successful it would become. Dark Souls originally did not have a port for Microsoft Windows, but upon seeing a fan petition for it, Bandai Namco community manager Tony Shoupinou lauded their support, and a Windows port was released in 2012. Dark Souls is also considered by some critics to be one of the greatest video games of all time, and has influenced the development of many future video games. Dark Souls II also received critical acclaim, and is the highest rated game in the series on Metacritic. Before release, Dark Souls III was one of the most anticipated games of 2016, and also received critical acclaim upon release. The \\"bloodstain\\" gameplay mechanic has been given praise by critics. David Craddock of Shacknews called bloodstains \\"the hook that reels Demon's and Dark Souls players back in time and time again\\", and said that the resurrection of all enemies upon death make the journey back to one's bloodstain \\"quite the nail-biter\\". He stated that the harshest punishment one can receive in a Souls game is \\"not dying once, but twice.\\" Stephen Totilo of Kotaku called bloodstains the \\"best game death innovation\\" after playing a demo of Demon's Souls, questioning 'what took so long for a breakthrough like this?'\\" GamesRadar+ called bloodstains, in combination with Demon Souls's message system, \\"a graceful, elegant way of letting players guide each other without the need for words\\", and said that \\"rarely has the price of failure been balanced on such a precarious knife edge\\" as being forced to retrieve one's bloodstain. The series inspired a social media app for iOS and Android called Soapstone, which uses a similar online messaging system used in the series adapted for the real world, using GPS to determine a user's location and bringing up a list of cryptic messages posted by other users in the area. The bonfire concept was similarly praised. Matthew Elliott of GamesRadar+ called bonfires a powerful symbol of relief, and \\"a meaty cocktail of progress, exhaustion and joy\\", and that, while other games evoke emotions with their save points, no other game does so as effectively. Vice called the Bonfire a \\"mark of genius\\" that \\"reinvented the save point\\" and allowed the player to reflect on their progress. Sales , Demon's Souls had sold an estimated 1.7 million copies, while , the Dark Souls series had sold over 25 million copies worldwide. Dark Souls III broke sales records upon release, with the title being the fastest-selling game in Bandai Namco's history, selling over three million copies worldwide a month after its international release. By May 2020, the series had sold over 27 million copies. Legacy 200px A comic book by Titan Comics and based on the series debuted alongside the international release of Dark Souls III in April 2016. That same month, a Kickstarter campaign for an officially licensed board game based on the series was announced, titled Dark Souls ‚Äì The Board Game. The campaign was funded within the first three minutes of its launch, and was published by Steamforged Games and released in April 2017. In February 2017, music from the series composed by Motoi Sakuraba, was performed by a live orchestra at the Salle Pleyel concert hall in Paris. In September of that year, a limited edition vinyl box set containing the soundtracks of all three games was released in Europe. In Japan, a box set containing the enhanced versions of all three games for the PlayStation 4, the soundtracks for each, bookends, artwork prints, and dictionaries detailing every in-game item from the series were released on May 24, 2018. Soulslike The Souls series has led the video game industry to use the term \\"Soulslike\\" to describe action role-playing games from other developers that follow general principles of the Souls series, though there is no well-established definition for such games. Similar to the Souls series, Soulslike games typically have a high level of difficulty where repeated player-character death is expected and incorporated as part of the gameplay, losing all progress if certain checkpoints have not been reached, and a means to permanently improve the player-character's abilities as to be able to progress further. This mechanic provides a means to avoid an outright failure state, where the player must restart the game completely and lose all progress, while still providing a risk-and-reward system to make the game challenging to the player. Games considered to be Soulslike include Salt and Sanctuary, Lords of the Fallen, Nioh, Remnant: From the Ashes, The Surge,, and Code Vein. Other games cited to have been generally influenced by Souls include Destiny, Shovel Knight, Titan Souls, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Assassin's Creed, God of War, and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. The \\"bloodstain\\" and other similar death mechanics have also been used in other games such as in Nioh and Nier: Automata. The series has also been cited as an influence on several of the PlayStation 4's PlayStation Network features, including its asynchronous messaging, social networking and video sharing features, as well as for the television show, Stranger Things.

John Asen is known from a funerary icon portrait in a monastery in the Peloponnese. A relative of an unnamed Byzantine empress consort, he is notable for his unusual amount of family names, indicating direct descent from as many as eight prominent Byzantine noble houses: the Doukas, Angelos, Palaiologos, Raoul, Laskaris, Tornikes, Philanthropenos and Asen families. Icon portrait The Mega Spelaion monastery in the Peloponnese, where John Asen's portrait was discovered A funerary icon featuring a portrait of John Asen was discovered in the early 20th century in the Mega Spelaion monastery's main church near Kalavryta in the Peloponnese, modern Greece. The icon was lost in a fire in 1934, but has been preserved in a photograph. The portrait measures and depicts a child next to an image of the Mother of God (Theotokos) and the infant Jesus Christ. John Asen is painted with a pale face and dark red hair, wearing a chlamys cloak decorated with double-headed eagles, circles and dragons. The infant Christ is shown blessing the child, whose pale and flat facial features in comparison to Jesus and the Theotokos are an indication that John Asen is dead. John Asen's portrait was accompanied by an epigram (no less than twelve lines long), which was originally inscribed on the icon's frame, but was later copied to the icon itself. The epigram mourns the child's death and compares him to a \\"flower cut down before its time\\". Identification A partially preserved inscription above the portrait reveals the unusually long name of the boy and his relation to an unnamed Byzantine empress consort. The letters had become almost illegible by the mid-19th century, when a local artist restored them‚Äîas the historian Demetrios Polemis comments, \\"one cannot tell how accurately\\". Greek archaeologist G. Sotiriou identified the empress with Helena Draga≈°, wife of Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos.–ë–æ–∂–∏–ª–æ–≤, p. 374. On the basis of Sotiriou's research and the available evidence, Bulgarian historian Ivan Bozhilov concludes that John Asen's ancestry must be linked to the last rulers of the Despotate of the Morea. Bozhilov considers it most likely that he was a son of Despot Demetrios Palaiologos and his third wife Theodora Asanina. Yet he does not exclude the possibility that he was a son of Demetrios' younger brother, Despot Thomas Palaiologos, and his wife Catherine Zaccaria.–ë–æ–∂–∏–ª–æ–≤, p. 373. If the latter identification is to be accepted, Bozhilov puts John Asen's birth at no earlier than 1444 and his death before 1449, when Demetrios Palaiologos ruled on Lemnos. He also dates the boy's portrait to after 1449, when Demetrios received half of the Morea as his possession from Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos, including Kalavryta and the Mega Spelaion monastery. A later theory has ascribed John Asen to the mid-14th century. Titos Papamastorakis considers him a son of Despot Manuel Komnenos Raoul Asen, a military commander who was a brother of Irene Asanina, wife of Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos. Name British historian Michael Angold considers John Asen's eight family names to exemplify \\"best of all\\" the importance of names in indicating noble status in Byzantine society. Fellow Byzantinist Dionysios Stathakopoulos agrees that John Asen's name was \\"less an instrument of identification than a manifesto of social association\\". Angold considers the order of eponyms in John Asen's name to be obscure. On the other hand, Bozhilov believes that the Asen name is the main one due to its final position, interpreting it as an \\"impressive manifestation of [the] marriage policy\\" of the Second Bulgarian Empire's royal dynasty.–ë–æ–∂–∏–ª–æ–≤, p. 22. Bozhilov also acknowledges that the amount of noble family names John Asen carries is \\"truly unusual\\".

History The Kano State Hisbah Corps was established by the state government in 2003 with the institutionalization of formerly local and privately maintained hisbah security units. Hisbah, which is an Arabic word meaning an act performed for the good of the society, is an Islamic religious concept that calls for \\"enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong on every Muslim.\\" The Hisbah Corps, which operates under the jurisdiction of a Hisbah Board composed of government officials, secular police officers, and religious leaders, is highly decentralized with local units supervised by committees composed of officials and citizens in the communities in which they operate. The relationship between the Hisbah Corps and civil police has been sometimes acrimonious. The Nigeria Police Force (NPF), to whom the Hisbah must report crimes, frequently refuse to cooperate in enforcement of religious law. On multiple occasions, NPF officers have arrested Hisbah members for trespassing when the latter have attempted to enter private property to enforce Sharia. And, in 2006, two senior Hisbah officers were detained by federal police and questioned on suspicion they were seeking foreign funding to train militants. there were approximately 9,000 male and female officers of the Kano State Hisbah Corps. The Kano State Hisbah court has extended its rule to some Northern States with high population of Muslims in Nigeria. Some regions in States like Kaduna and Kwara now have rules from the court that governs them. The court set up rules that bans ladies from using Mobile phones and sunglasses etc amongst other things listed. Authority and jurisdiction The Hisbah Corps does not have authority to execute arrests and officers are armed only with non-lethal weapons for self-defense, such as batons. Hisbah officers who observe violations of Sharia are expected to alert the Nigeria Police Force. Other duties of the Hisbah Corps include arbitrating the voluntary reconciliation of disputes, verbally chastising violators of Sharia, and maintaining order at religious celebrations. Hisbah are also trained to assist with disaster response operations. Comparison with other vigilante groups Some observers have compared hisbah activities in Nigeria to vigilante groups that have operated in other parts of the country, partly based on local tradition and partly as a response to failings of the police. However, as of 2004, Human Rights Watch was not aware of killings by hisba members, in contrast to other vigilante groups like the Bakassi Boys in the southeast and the Oodua People‚Äôs Congress in the southwest of the country, who have committed numerous extrajudicial killings and other abuses. It is also compared to the newly formed Operation Amotekun in the South West of the country.

During the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì39) he was Minister of Education and Fine Arts, then Minister of Education and Health. After the war he went into exile in Oran, Moscow and then Mexico. He was expelled from the party in 1944 for disloyalty to the leadership, and purged from the official history of the party after writing a book in 1953 critical of the Stalinist role in the Civil War. Early years Jes√∫s Hern√°ndez Tom√°s was born in Murcia in 1907. He was one of the founders of the Communist Party in Biscay. In 1922 he was part of the guard of √ìscar P√©rez Sol√≠s, Secretary General of the Spanish Communist Party (Partido Comunista Espa√±ol, PCE). Hern√°ndez participated in the failed attack on the socialist Indalecio Prieto. In 1927 he was a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth. Hern√°ndez was arrested in 1929 and released the next year. Hern√°ndez went to the Soviet Union around the time the Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed in 1931. He studied at the Leninist School in Moscow. In 1932 the Spanish Communist Party made a major change in direction when it abandoned the Comintern slogan \\"Workers' and Peasants' Government\\" and adopted \\"Defense of the Republic\\". Hern√°ndez Tom√°s was among the new leaders of the party who succeeded Jos√© Bullejos. The others were Jos√© D√≠az, Vicente Uribe, Antonio Mije and Juan Astigarrab√≠a. That year Hern√°ndez became a member of the PCE Politburo in charge of agitprop. He returned to Spain in 1933, and was made editor of the PCE journal Mundo Obrero (Worker's World). Civil war Hern√°ndez was elected Deputy for Cordoba in the 1936 elections. After the outbreak of Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì39), on 8 August 1936 he said clearly \\"We cannot talk today of the proletarian revolution in Spain, because the historical circumstances do not permit it.\\" The Stalinists did indeed provide substantial support for the Giral and Caballero governments, including important military aid from the USSR. President Francisco Largo Caballero appointed Hern√°ndez Minister of Education and Fine Arts on 4 September 1936. The Socialist Largo Caballero found himself increasingly isolated, and by February 1937 was demanding that his ministers confirm their support for him, particularly the communist ministers Vicente Uribe and Jes√∫s Hern√°ndez. On 15 May 1937 Uribe and Hern√°ndez caused the collapse of Largo Caballero's government. The trigger was a disagreement in a cabinet meeting over the May Days violence in Barcelona, which the communists blamed on the Anarchist CNT and FAI and the POUM. They demanded that the POUM be banned and its leaders arrested as \\"fascists\\". Largo Caballero refused to act, and most of the ministers walked out of the meeting. On 17 May 1937 the new President Juan Negr√≠n appointed Hern√°ndez Minister of Education and Health. Hern√°ndez launched reforms that treated education as a social function. The PCE campaign against the CNT continued. On 2 August 1937 Hern√°ndez told reporters after a cabinet meeting \\"the cabinet has been concerned with examining what measures needed to be taken ... in order to forestall and curtail with the utmost vigour any attempted distirubance or upset which certain extremist elements, who are the instruments of fascism, may seek to provoke.\\" Hern√°ndez conducted a campaign against Indalecio Prieto, the Minister of National Defense. Prieto left office early in 1938 due to his efforts. Hern√°ndez was replaced by Segundo Blanco in a cabinet reshuffle in April 1938 and was appointed political commissar in the South Central area. When the Republican forces were defeated in the Battle of the Ebro (July‚ÄìNovember 1938) and General Francisco Franco's troops reached the Mediterranean, Hern√°ndez stayed in Madrid with Pedro Checa, Luis Cabo Giorla, Isidoro Di√©guez Due√±as and Antonio Mije while the main Communist leadership center was established in Barcelona. Hern√°ndez later took virtual leadership of the party. Hern√°ndez was forced to leave Madrid after the March 1939 coup d'√©tat by Segismundo Casado. Later career After the fall of the Republican government in March 1939 Hern√°ndez went into exile in Oran, and then in Moscow. He was elected to the Executive Committee of the Communist International. He lost influence during the power struggle that followed the suicide of Jos√© D√≠az in March 1942. In 1943 Joseph Stalin sent him to Mexico, and in 1944 he was expelled from the PCE for working against the party executive. In 1953 Hern√°ndez published memoirs of the Civil War under the title Yo fui ministro de Stalin (I Was Stalin's Minister). The French translation was published as La Grande trahison (The Great Betrayal). The book revealed how Andr√©s Nin had been tortured and then killed, the Proc√®s de Moscou tribunal and other aspects of Stalinist interference. PCE loyalists called Hern√°ndez a \\"bon vivant\\", \\"womanizer\\", \\"degenerate\\" and other derogatory terms. In 1953 Hern√°ndez founded the short-lived Independent Communist Party, based in Bucharest. The party was pro-Yugoslav. After it dissolved he left politics and returned to Mexico where he lived until his death in 1971. He was omitted from the official PCE history published in Paris in 1960. In her memoirs Dolores Ib√°rruri referred to him as \\"the other communist minister\\", but would not name him.

He was born in 1917 in Lahore, in the erstwhile British India and secured a diploma in sculpture from the National College of Arts (formerly known as Mayo School of Art), Lahore. His career started as a member of the faculty at the College of Art, Delhi in 1947 where he rose to the position of the head of the Sculpture Department by the time of his retirement in 1977. Bhagat participated in the first three Triennales staged in India, The All India Sculpture Exhibition in 1954 and many exhibitions held at galleries such as Bombay Art Society, the Academy of Fine Arts, Kolkata, and the All India Fine Arts and Crafts Society, New Delhi. The Lalit Kala Akademi hosted a retrospective of Bhagat in 1978 and his works are exhibited at the National Gallery of Modern Art, among other art galleries. Though he worked on several media like papier-mache, aluminium, copper and stone, most of his known works are in wood and is characterized by their geometric shapes. He also produced many drawings towards the later part of his life. Bhagat was the first prize winner at two art competitions conducted by Punjab Fine Arts Society, Lahore in 1937 and 1945 and he won the first prize at two more competitions by All India Fine Arts and Crafts Society in 1947 and 1949.

Staff of an outdoor \\"color powder party\\" sprayed clouds of corn starch towards the participants, which ignited. The fire lasted 40 seconds and burned 508 people, killing 15 and leaving 199 in critical condition. Initially, only patches of airborne corn starch caught fire and extinguished almost instantly, but the staff sprayed carbon-dioxide fire extinguishers towards the participants, which, compounded by the running of the participants, dispersed the airborne corn starch into multiple dust clouds, responsible for most of the burning. The dust fire was widely misreported to have been an explosion. Background The \\"Color Play Asia\\" party was inspired by the colored powder used in the Hindu religious festival \\"Holi\\", also called \\"festival of colors\\", which is celebrated in India, Nepal, and other countries with large Hindu populations. In August 2013, the first Taiwanese color party took place in Sizihwan, Kaohsiung City. It was organized by the same event company that organized \\"Color Play Asia\\". That same year, a National Tsing Hua University expert warned that the colored powder used during the Color Play Asia parties might cause a dust explosion if the material was combustible. Event On 27 June 2015, the \\"Color Play Asia\\" party was held at the Formosa Fun Coast water park. Party-goers were singing and dancing on the stage, which holds up to 1,000. Other party-goers danced in a drained pool nearby. The concert organizers deployed colored corn starch powder in the festivities. The method of powder application at the concert created \\"an extremely dense dust cloud over the stage and its immediate vicinity\\", people near the stage were standing \\"almost ankle-deep\\" in colored corn starch powder, and the powder was repeatedly suspended into the air using air blowers as well as compressed gas canisters. At about 20:30, a large deflagration occurred when a cloud of colored powder ignited after being discharged from the stage onto a crowd of 1,000 people during a concert. Some of the crowd breathed in the powder, causing respiratory problems. As recorded in an amateur video by an audience member, a massive fireball suddenly engulfed the stage. The powder caught fire along the ground, resulting in burns mainly to victims' limbs and torsos. According to the authorities, the fire was quickly extinguished. Some victims were carried out on swim rings because their skin was sloughing off when touched. The rescue included help from army vehicles and soldiers, along with medical services. Injuries and fatalities { class=\\"wikitable sortable floatright\\" !

As of 29 November 2015, 15 of the 497 injured had died, 44 victims remained hospitalized, and 11 were being treated at intensive care wards, while fifty- seven others were discharged from hospitals after treatment. Most of the injured were tertiary students in their twenties and late teens who had just started their summer vacation. An earlier estimate of 519 injured was due to double-counting of patients that were transferred between hospitals. Many victims were lightly clad because of hot weather () and the water park venue, and suffered burns over large portions of their bodies. Some victims suffered burns to 80‚Äì90% of their skin. Four foreigners injured in the event were flown home via International SOS flights for follow-up medical treatment on 29 June: two to Hong Kong (Queen Mary Hospital and Prince of Wales Hospital), one to Shanghai (Ruijin Hospital) and one to Singapore (Singapore General Hospital). Two suicides were linked to the event: a father of a surviving burn victim committed suicide, while another suicidal man donated his skin to the victims. Response New Taipei City's mayor Eric Chu ordered an immediate shutdown of the water park pending an investigation. The man responsible for the event was detained by police for investigation. On 28 June, Taiwan Premier Mao Chi-kuo banned the use of colored powders at private events until the investigation is concluded and the powder can be considered safe. The event's organizer and hardware engineer were questioned and then given bail on the condition that they not leave the country. Lu Chung-chi apologized for the explosion on 28 June. On 28 June a spokesman for (mainland) China's Taiwan Affairs Office, Ma Xiaoguang, expressed sympathy for the victims and hoped they all received timely and appropriate treatment. On 30 June Taiwan's Organ Registry and Sharing Center called for urgent donations of cadaver skin, since there were just 115 rolls left in the country's cadaver skin stocks. According to Chairman Lee Po-chang (), cadaver skin is more effective in blocking burn wounds from contamination sources and promoting skin regeneration than hog skin or synthetic skin. According to officials, the Ministry of Health and Welfare collaborated with the New Taipei City Public Health Department and made an announcement that all medical expenses of the burn patients from 27 June to 30 September will be covered by the National Health Insurance Administration and the National Health Insurance Program. On 2 July, a spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office said it was ready to provide medical assistance to help treat the hundreds of people injured in the explosion. On 3 July, Taiwanese Minister of Health and Welfare Chiang Been- huang said he was grateful for China's offer to provide medical assistance, including donations of cadaver skin to Taiwan, but it should be first confirmed that the skin was not from executed prisoners. Cadaver skin from the United States and Netherlands was sent to Taiwan. Investigation Investigators raised the question of whether the powder was ignited by a cigarette or spark; the supplier of the flammable, starch-based powder said \\"if it's in dense quantities and if it's hot, it can catch fire\\". Organizers had purchased three tons of the powder, and wrote on their Facebook page that it consisted of cornstarch and food coloring. The powder was sprayed from the stage onto concert-goers \\"at high velocity\\". The vice president of Tai Won Food Industrial Co, which makes the powder, says that there are warnings on the packages not to use them in closed spaces or under high temperatures. The New Taipei City news department head stated: \\"It's still not clear what happened, but there were a number of people smoking and the weather was warm.\\" The Fire Department's preliminary conclusion wast that the fire was caused by the sprayed powder, and that stage lights may have been the source of ignition. WuFeng University fire science department instructor and Taichung Harbor Fire Department deputy captain Lu Shou-chien commented in a letter to the Chinese-language United Daily News that the event organizers had set up necessary conditions for a disaster, and had not used water sprays which would have reduced the risk of ignition. Smoking was permitted at the event, and approximately 40 cigarette butts were found afterwards. In October 2015, the committee set up by the New Taipei City government to oversee monetary donations related to the explosion announced plans to distribute the collected funds. Survivors were to receive between NT$65,000 and NT$6.5 million, depending on the severity of injuries sustained in the dust explosion. The families of the twelve people who had died were compensated NT$8.25 million. On 16 October 2015, Shilin District prosecutors charged the event organizer, Lu Chung-chi, with negligence during the disaster; owners of the park were not indicted. Lu was found guilty of the charges in April 2016. In 2018, Lu was sentenced to five years in prison. In June 2016, the Supreme Court authorized the seizure of NT$507 million in assets from the park's senior administration. The National Health Insurance Administration also sought compensation worth NT$436 million from event organizers in court, claiming that the medical cost incurred by the NHIA totaled NT$765 million. Aftermath After the accident, the government has adopted several emergency-related measures, such as the easing of the requirements for National Health Insurance coverage for burn victims, and importing large amount of artificial and cadaver skin.

Construction  Reconstruction of a schanze and chartaque on the Barocque schanze near Gersbach in the Black Forest area Reconstruction of a chartaque on the Lafnitz, the old border between Styria and Hungary, east of Burgau The original form, to which the name relates, was built of four logs, but over time chartaques were built in different sizes depending on the number of defending units. Fundamentally they were places of observation and defence. A characteristic structural feature of chartaques is that they consisted of a lookout tower with a palisade around the base. Other defensive works such as schanzen, abatis, ramparts and ditches were often built in the vicinity as additional protection against an enemy. The construction of a chartaque was an operation that lasted several weeks. In 1706, during the time of the Kuruc wars, precise details are known about the fortifications of the Kuruc schanzen in eastern Styria. For one four-man chartaque, thus a relatively small one (there were also chartaques for up to 20 men), which was to be built in Goritz bei Radkersburg, about three kilometres north of the town of Radkersburg, the following was assessed to be needed: 20 workers (socagers from the surrounding villages), eight log posts each of three fathoms (ca. 18 feet long), 24 logs for beams and wall benches, 18 logs for the upper and lower floors, 25 battens, 75 wide boards, 400 batten nails, 1,000 shingle nails, 67 carts and, as for tradesmen, master carpenter: 18 man days and carpenter's apprentices: 54 man days. Such a chartaque came at a cost of 28 guilders and 24 kreuzer (plus the \\"free\\" socage). For two or three chartaques an overseer was appointed in addition to the crews of each chartaque.Fritz Posch: Flammende Grenze. Die Steiermark in den Kuruzzenst√ºrmen. 1st Edition. Verlag Styria, Graz 1968, p. 203. 2nd edition as: a publication by the Styrian Archives. Volume 5. Styria, Graz-Vienna-Cologne, 1986. . For the rebuilding of another chartaque which was burned down to its supporting posts, the cost was estimated at 30 guilders.Posch: Flammende Grenze. p. 250. There were also chartaques that were additionally protected by a small redoubt (redutierte Tschartaken), the redoubt costing an estimated 40 guilders.Posch: Flammende Grenze. S. 201, 203‚Äì204 For larger chartaques for 12-15 men, 32 construction- quality logs (Stubenb√§ume), six rafter logs (Gesparrb√§ume), four complete trees for the posts, 75 standard boards and 1,500 batten nails were needed.Posch: Flammende Grenze. p. 194  History  The Ottomans took over these installations from their eastern neighbours, the Persians, who had long been their enemies, and used the idea against their western enemies. Thus chartaques found their way to the Styrian-Hungarian border area and were adopted, in turn, by their opponents. At first they were built by the Styrians and Lower Austrians as part of their defence against the Ottomans and later strengthened to defend their lands against the Kurucs. Chartaques were usually erected in lines in order to be able to relay warning shots and other visual and audible messages. Depending on the state of the terrain, they might be arranged at intervals of about one to three kilometres. They were supporting elements of defensive lines. For example, between Radkersburg and Fehring, a distance of about 27 kilometres as the crow flies, 13 chartaques were built, and between Fehring and F√ºrstenfeld from the Raab valley to the Lafnitz valley, a distance of about 15 kilometres, 18-19 chartaques were erected.Posch: Flammende Grenze. pp. 194‚Äì203. The description of these military installations has survived to the present day.Chartaques, information and photographs of chartaques at sagen.at They were also installed as part of the Baroque lines of fortification in southwest Germany, where they were also called chartaques. Today only a very few chartaques have survived. In several places, however, they have been faithfully reconstructed. For example, in Burgau in 1995, a chartaque was reconstructed on the Lafnitz, once the border river between Austria and Hungary.Tschartake in Burgau, die nachgebaute Tschartake in Burgau Other reconstructions are found on the Eppingen Lines.

Early years and education Abelardo Sergio Vicioso Gonz√°lez was born in 1930 in Santo Domingo. His parents were Sergio Vicioso and Leonor Gonz√°lez, and he was the oldest one of five sons. His talent for literature came through his early years as a child and his first poems were published in 1948, at the age of 18, in the newspaper \\"El Caribe\\". Vicioso studied Law in the University of Sant Domingo and graduated in 1953.http://www.cielonaranja.com/menaabelardo.htm Life and career After applying for a diplomatic position in the Government -as requested in a Dominican newspaper-, unexpectedly Trujillo in person named Abelardo in the Army, with the rank of Second Lieutenant. Afterwards he became First Lieutenant, acting as Academy Military Instructor, and also directing the Army official magazine. Finally Vicioso was named as Military Prosecutor. However, and given the unbreathable existing political situation, he joined the groups who conspired against the tyrant. As advised, and in order to save his life, his father Sergio, with important connections in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, could take him out of the country designated as Vice-Council in Cura√ßao. Trujillo got terribly mad when he knew the decision, so instead decided to send his brother Vinicio, experienced piloto graduated from the prestigious Lackland US Air Force Base Academy in Texas- to Cura√ßao to bring back his brother Abelardo. Both being in danger, finally decided to stay in the former Dutch colony, then transferring to Cuba, as political refugees. But there they were kept in prison by Fidel Castro government accused of being Trujillo's spies, version Trujillo officially spread. One year later they were both released. Simultaneously, his family in Santo Domingo was retained in the military base of San Isidro as lure hostages, being tortured psicologically for several months. Previously, there was an attempt of poisoning his father Sergio, hospitalized in Padre Billini Hospital, action discovered and aborted by nurse nuns.Abelardo Vicioso intelectual de abril Retrieved on 3 Mar 2018 In 1963 he returned to his native land, the Dominican Republic, after Trujillo had been executed (1961), when Juan Bosch -first democratic President elected democratically after dictatorship-, came to power (although overthrown seven months later by conservative forces). Just a few months before, his tormented brother Vinicio unfortunately committed suicide. In 1965, during April Revolution held to reconstitute the government of Juan Bosch, his poem \\"Canto a Santo Domingo Vertical\\" became a hymn of combatants. The whole family supported the conflict by conforming the comando named Los Lobos located in Arzobispo Meri√±o street almost corner Mercedes street, where even kids and women healed and prepared food for the rebels and also placed mirrors in the rooftop of the building to dazzle attacking opponent plane pilots in order to avoid their lethal falling bombs. After concluding the Civil War and US Intervention, Vicioso became professor of the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo (UASD) -Autonomous since 1961 and where he graduated of Law in 1953-, being elected first as Director of Literature Department of the Faculty of Humanities, later as Vice-Dean of said Faculty, and finally Dean for two consecutive periods. Political activity During his stay in Cuba, Vicioso co-founded the People's Socialist Party. Years later (1982), this political organization joined the Dominican Liberation Party(PLD), and Abelardo immediately integrated into its Central Committee. He was also personal assistant to Professor Juan Bosch, the President of the Party. In 1992 he left PLD and founded the Alliance for Democracy, of which Abelardo was Vice- president. Afterwrads, the Alliance for Democracy supported PLD and during the first presidential term of Leonel Fern√°ndez Reina (1996-2000) Vicioso was his Special Assistant. He always stood for the Cuban revolution. He co-founded the Dominican Friends of Cuba Committee, and later became its president. In 1997, he was appointed life president of the Casa del Poeta (Poet's House). Personal life In 1964 Abelardo married Altagracia Solano, daughter of a wealthy landowner Santiago de los Caballeros, with whom procreated two children: Cynthia and Carlos. Vicioso was born with a hereditary disease named ankylosing spondyloarthritis (a rheumatic disease with pain and joint stiffening). During his last years of Life he began to writeg his first (and only) autobiographical novel with the title of \\"Memorias del Teniente Veneno\\" (Memoirs of Lieutenant Poison). However, and almost before concluding it, Vicioso died at the age of 74 due to cardiorespiratory problems on January 13, 2004 in his home in Santo Domingo.

Paul Molitor was the first player who underwent the surgery to be elected to the Hall of Fame. Jos√© Mesa was one of the first players born outside the United States to undergo the surgery. John Farrell was perhaps the first player to undergo the surgery twice. Scott Schoeneweis was one of the first players to undergo the surgery while in college. Dewon Brazelton was one of the first players to undergo the surgery while in high school. Jay Payton was one of the first position players to undergo the surgery twice. John Smoltz was the first pitcher who underwent the surgery to be elected to the Hall of Fame. Jamie Moyer is the oldest player to undergo the surgery. Jonny Venters is one of the only players to undergo the surgery more than two times. Tommy John surgery (TJS), known in medical practice as ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) reconstruction, is a surgical graft procedure in which the ulnar collateral ligament in the medial elbow is replaced with either a tendon from elsewhere from the patient's own body, or the use of a tendon from the donated tissue from a cadaver. The procedure is common among collegiate and professional athletes in several sports, most notably baseball. The procedure was first performed in 1974 by orthopedic surgeon Dr. Frank Jobe, then a Los Angeles Dodgers team physician. The surgery is named after Tommy John, the first recipient of the surgery. John won 288 games in his career‚Äì124 before the surgery and 164 after. Many players have subsequently undergone the surgery, some more than once.

Plot Vera von Schalburg (portrayed by Valerie Niehaus) is a German prostitute working in Nazi Germany. In 1938, one year before the outbreak of World War II, Schalburg is arrested by the Berlin police. She is offered to work as a spy for the Abwehr, the German military intelligence service, instead of facing jail time. Completely unaware of the secret war preparations being conducted by her government, and unwilling to leave her teenage son who later joins the Hitler Youth, she accepts the offer. She quickly meets and befriends Wilhelm Canaris (portrayed by Peter Prager), chief of the Abwehr, and is selected for a top-secret mission to Great Britain. When Schalburg learns of innocent Polish civilians being killed on mass in German-occupied Poland, she wants to leave. To prevent this, Abwehr agents led by Walther Luthmann (portrayed by Jochen Nickel) kidnaps her son, but Schalburg manages to track him down and go into hiding with him. Realizing that Germany has lost the war, Schalburg moves to farm far away from the fighting with a male friend who becomes a sort of foster father for her son. Even though the war is long over by now, Luthmann, after confronting Schalburg at the farm, kills her for betraying the Abwehr during the war while in disguise as a common civilian.

It is given by injection into a vein. Common side effect include nausea, fever, liver problems, headache, trouble sleeping, and pain at the site of injection. Severe side effects may include anaphylaxis, seizures, and Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea. While use appears to be safe in pregnancy the medication has not been well studied in this group. Doses should be adjusted in those with kidney problems. Ceftazidime works by interfering with the building of the bacterial cell wall while avibactam works by preventing ceftazidime's breakdown. The combination was approved for medical use in the United States and the European Union in 2015. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Medical use Ceftazidime/avibactam is used to treat certain multidrug-resistant gram- negative infections. Ceftazidime/avibactam is used for the treatment of: * complicated intra-abdominal infections. In these cases it is often used in combination with metronidazole, which provides coverage for anaerobic pathogens. * complicated urinary tract infections, including acute pyelonephritis, in adults. * hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia.https://www.allergan.com/assets/pdf/avycaz_pi Bacterial activity For many bacterial infections, it offers little or no advantage over ceftazidime monotherapy, due to the widespread expression of resistance mechanisms other than Œ≤-lactamase production. These include Haemophilus, Moraxella and Neisseria pathogens, and infections caused by Acinectobacter baumannii. The antibacterial spectrum of ceftazidime/avibactam includes nearly all Enterobacteriaceae, including ceftazidime-resistant strains. The activity of ceftazidime/avibactam against the important hospital pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is variable, due to the potential presence of other resistance mechanisms in addition to Œ≤-lactamase production. Synergy was observed for avibactam with ceftazidime in the Burkholderia cepacia complex. Adverse events When used to treat life-threatening infections, ceftazidime/avibactam is more likely than carbapenem antibiotics to cause serious adverse events, including worsening kidney function and gastrointestinal adverse effects. Mechanism of action Bacterial resistance to cephalosporins is often due to bacterial production of Œ≤-lactamase enzymes that deactivate these antibiotics. Avibactam inhibits some (but not all) bacterial √ü-lactamases. Also, some bacteria are resistant to cephalosporins by other mechanisms, and therefore avibactam doesn't work. Avibactam is not active against New Delhi metallo-Œ≤- lactamase 1 (NDM-1). Avibactam inhibits Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPCs), and AmpC-type Œ≤-lactamases, which are resistant to the other clinically-available Œ≤-lactamases, tazobactam and clavulanic acid.  Regulatory  It was granted approval for marketing in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2015. It was granted approval for marketing in Europe by the European Medicines Agency in 2016. During its clinical development, ceftazidime/avibactam was designated as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product under the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now provision of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act. Development of ceftazidime/avibactam was fast-tracked by the FDA due to the shortage of drugs for treatment of infections due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

Life Letitia Bushe was born around 1705 or 1710 in Dangan, County Kilkenny. She was the daughter of Arthur Bushe, a secretary to the commissioners of revenue, and Mary (n√©e Forth). Though Bushe is considered a talented artist there is no evidence of her receiving any training, though it is thought Bernard Lens or one of his sons may have given her lessons. She may have been largely self-taught as her style remained naive throughout her career. Bushe was continuously in demand as a lady's companion due to her conversational skills, which leading to her teach painting to many women and their children. She was a friend of Mary Delany, Jonathan Swift and Anne Donnellan. She had a six-year relationship with a younger woman Lady Anne Bligh, which some have speculated to have been a romantic one. When she was not acting as a companion she had rooms in Dawson Street. Bushe died on the 17 November 1757 in those rooms. She was buried the following day in St Andrew's church, Dublin. Friendship with Mary Delany Bushe was a friend of Mary Delany from 1731. She stayed with Delany on numerous occasions, and a miniature of Bushe by Joseph Browne is included in the 1861 Correspondence of Mrs Delany edited by Lady Llanover. Much of what is known about Bushe's life is from the letters between her and Delany. Details included was the fact that Bushe contracted smallpox which marred her good looks, and her poverty after her father's death is the reason she believed she did not receive any offers of marriage. Bush and Delany remained very good friends, with Delany referring to Bushe drawing landscapes, and cleaning painting at Delany's home Delville House. Bushe and Delany embarked on a number of artist projects together. Delany described Bushe as \\"a gay, good-humoured, innocent girl, without the least conceit of her beauty .... she paints delightfully\\" and Delany painted Bushe herself. Artistic work One of Bushe's pieces which is in the National Gallery of Ireland, A view of Bray (1736), shows her skill as a topographical artist and her humour, as she includes herself in the painting with an accompanying dog. During a visit to England in 1743, she painted a View of London which is taken from Hampstead Heath, as well as views of Bath and Bristol. In Ireland, Bushe painted studies of country houses, including their gardens. She also made antiquarian drawings for Bishop Robert Clayton, a friend of Delany.

He is best known for the autobiographical chronicle of his experience with throat cancer, The Doctor, (initially published as A Taste of My Own Medicine), which was the basis of the movie The Doctor, starring William Hurt as a physician modeled on Dr. Rosenbaum. He was also the founder of the Division of Arthritis and Rheumatic Diseases at the Oregon Health & Science University, where a chair of medicine is named in his honor.  Early life  Rosenbaum was born in Omaha, Nebraska to Bessie Mittleman Rosenbaum and Sam Rosenbaum. He graduated from Omaha Central High School.  Training  Rosenbaum attended Creighton University and, in 1934, transferred to a combined bachelor and medical degree program at the University of Nebraska College of Medicine, where he earned an M.D. in 1938. He interned at Jewish Hospital of St. Louis (1938‚Äì39), did a residency in metabolic disease at Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago (1939‚Äì40), and began a fellowship in internal medicine at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester (1940‚Äì41). After army service in World War II, he returned to the Mayo Clinic (1946‚Äì48) where he trained in rheumatology under future Nobel laureate Phillip Hench.  Military service  While in medical training, Rosenbaum joined the US Army Reserve. In 1941, he was called to active duty. He was assigned to a mobile surgical unit that was deployed in the invasions of Africa, Sicily, and Normandy. In late 1944, Dr. Rosenbaum, who had suffered from burns, malaria, and hepatitis, was transferred back to the United States and then hospitalized for six months. He had been promoted to major and awarded the Bronze Star. He finished his Army service as chief of medical services for the Women‚Äôs Army Corps. Medical practice and teaching Rosenbaum moved to Portland, Oregon in January, 1948 where he joined Dr. Isadore Brill to practice internal medicine and rheumatology. Rosenbaum was soon joined in practice by his brother William M. Rosenbaum, M.D. and, a few years later, by John Flanery. M.D. Over the years, a number of other physicians joined Rosenbaum's practice, including his nephew, Robert A. Rosenbaum, M.D., and his son, Richard B. Rosenbaum, M.D. Edward Rosenbaum was on the volunteer faculty of the University of Oregon Medical School (now Oregon Health & Science University) where he established the Division of Arthritis and Rheumatic Diseases in 1950. He headed the division for thirty years. In 1979 he wrote a rheumatology text, Rheumatology: New Directions in Therapy. Rosennbaum retired from the practice of medicine in 1986. DMSO In 1963, Rosenbaum began to collaborate with Dr. Stanley Jacob in research on medical uses of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The drug showed promise in the treatment of many conditions and the popular press brought the researchers briefly into the public limelight, but safety concerns ultimately limited the drug‚Äôs use. The Doctor In 1985, Rosenbaum was diagnosed with throat cancer. He kept a diary of experiences as a cancer patient, which Random House published as A Taste of My Own Medicine. The book became the basis of the 1991 movie The Doctor and was issued as a paperback under that name. With the publicity from the movie, the paperback became a best-seller. Rosenbaum appears in a brief scene in the movie, playing a doctor in a hospital corridor. The success of the book and movie led Rosenbaum to embark on a second career as a writer and speaker. He advocated for more humane practices in medicine. He was a columnist for New Choices magazine briefly, served as a medical advisor to the 1995 movie Roommates, and a collection of his essays was used in an English language instruction text for Japanese medical students. Personal life Rosenbaum married Davida Naftalin, daughter of Rose Naftalin, in 1942. They had four sons and six grandchildren. He suffered from Parkinson's disease in his final years and his illness was chronicled in a book written by his eldest son. Rosenbaum died in Portland, Oregon, on May 31, 2009, six weeks after the birth of his first great- grandchild. Honors and legacy In 1992, Rosenbaum was the commencement speaker at the College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific, which for a time presented an annual Edward E. Rosenbaum Humanism in Medicine award. A chair of medicine at the Oregon Health and Science University is named after Rosenbaum. His son, James T. Rosenbaum, currently holds the chair. The Edward E. Rosenbaum Hospice Life Award from the Pacific NW Hospice Foundation is also named after him.

The group only uses the highest quality, evidence-based studies (frequently, but not always Cochrane Reviews), and does not accept any outside funding or advertisements. The Basic Idea There is a way of understanding how much modern medicine has to offer individual patients. It is a simple statistical concept called the ‚ÄúNumber-Needed-to-Treat‚Äù, or for short the ‚ÄòNNT‚Äô. The NNT offers a measurement of the impact of a medicine or therapy by estimating the number of patients that need to be treated in order to have an impact on one person. The concept is statistical, but intuitive, for we know that not everyone is helped by a medicine or intervention ‚Äî some benefit, some are harmed, and some are unaffected. The NNT tells us how many of each. Imagine for instance a fictional heart attack treatment called ‚ÄòStopAttack‚Äô. Imagine that 75 percent of heart attack victims who take StopAttack survive, but only 25 percent survive if they are not given StopAttack, as shown in the graph below. This is certainly a major reduction in deaths. But note that 25 percent of people will die whether they get StopAttack or not (the bottom of the graph) and 25 percent will survive whether they get StopAttack or not (the top). These two groups are therefore unaffected by StopAttack, and the treatment neither helped nor hurt them. For the 50 percent in the middle, however, StopAttack was life-saving. The tricky part is that for most treatments we don‚Äôt know which group a person undergoing treatment will end up in, the group that was helped, the group that was harmed, or the group that was unaffected. Therefore in order to be honest and open, so that expectations are realistic and decisions are well informed, before a treatment like StopAttack is begun we can estimate the likelihood of each one of these possibilities. Here‚Äôs how that estimation works: If we calculate how many people we need to treat with StopAttack in order for one person to be positively affected, the number is 2. This is because StopAttack positively affected (saved the lives of) 50 percent, but did not help the 25 percent who would have died, nor the 25 percent who would have survived either way. This means that ‚Äú1 in 2 heart attack victims are affected by StopAttack‚Äù, or that ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a 50 percent chance that treatment with StopAttack will save a heart attack victim‚Äôs life.‚Äù Therefore the number of people we need to treat with StopAttack in order for us to know it affected one person is, on average, two people. In other words the NNT = 2. The NNT is an intuitive and simple way of estimating how likely it is that a treatment or medicine will help an individual person. And it turns out that the NNT for a drug or intervention is easily calculated from the results of any trial done on that drug or intervention. Since most drugs and interventions have been studied at some point we know and can estimate an NNT for many (if not most) of the things that we do, which means that physicians and their patients can easily determine and discuss the likelihood that a patient will be helped, or harmed, or unaffected, by a given medication or procedure. Behind the numbers (How the NNT is calculated) In controlled trials of medical interventions (drugs, surgeries, etc.) there is always an ‚Äòoutcome measure‚Äô, which is a researcher‚Äôs way of saying that there is always something that they are measuring to determine whether or not the intervention helped. In the above case of StopAttack, the outcome measure was mortality (i.e. death rate). StopAttack was aimed at reducing deaths from heart attacks, and in our fictional example it worked, reducing deaths by 50%, a tremendous effect. This translated into an NNT of 2, and the formal calculation for this is: 100/50 = 2. This comes from the following formula for calculating the NNT: 100/ARR = NNT. So what‚Äôs the ‚ÄòARR‚Äô? It‚Äôs the ‚Äòabsolute risk reduction‚Äô, which means the reduction in the risk of the outcome (mortality in this case). The reduction in the risk of mortality using StopAttack was 50%. If we now imagine a scenario in which 10% of people who have untreated heart attacks die and 90% survive (this is pretty close to reality), then we‚Äôll find a very different effect for a treatment we‚Äôll call StopAttack2. In fact, StopAttack2 can‚Äôt be nearly as effective as StopAttack, since above StopAttack reduced death from 75% to 25% (a total of a 50% reduction) and in this scenario only 10%, or 1 out of 10 people, die without the treatment. This means that the maximum amount that StopAttack2 could possibly reduce deaths is only 10%. In other words when only 1 out of 10 people die of a disease the best you could possibly do is to save the 1 out of 10 people who were going to die. And if we were able to find a miracle treatment that could do that (take the 10% mortality rate down to 0%) this would translate into an NNT of 10. Why? Because 100/ARR = NNT, and in this case the reduction in risk is 10% (we went from 10% mortality to 0%, an absolute risk reduction, or ARR, of 10%). But let‚Äôs say that we had a third treatment, StopAttack3, which reduced death by 2%, from 10% to 8%. While this is a small number, it also represents a potentially important reduction in deaths when it is used on many people. This is an ARR of 2%, which means 2 out of every 100 people are saved by using StopAttack3, for an NNT of 50. We would, on average, have to treat 50 patients for 1 patient to have been saved from death. But it does mean that, like above, there is a significant group of patients that will be treated with StopAttack3 that will be unaffected in either direction ‚Äî they will either die or survive regardless of the drug. In this case 90% will survive regardless of whether they receive StopAttack3 and 8% will die regardless of their treatment. This means 98% of the patients, in total, who are subjected to it will be unaffected by StopAttack3. But there‚Äôs another way to describe what‚Äôs happening here. We could say that a reduction of 2% from an expected death rate of 10% is a ‚Äú20% reduction in death‚Äù, and we would be correct, at least semantically. Here‚Äôs why: if we only concentrate on the 10% of people who die of their heart attacks we can see in the graph below that a 2% reduction is actually a 20% relative reduction in risk, RRR. In other words relative to the 10% who would normally die, if only 8% die then this is a 20% proportional reduction in death rate. The problem with this type of description is that, although it is semantically correct it is profoundly misleading. This is because before a treatment begins patients and doctors don‚Äôt know whether a patient will be helped, harmed, or unaffected by the treatment. If, in a conversation with a patient, we use the RRR to describe how likely it is that StopAttack3 will work (i.e. ‚ÄúStopAttack reduces your chance of dying by 20%‚Äù) then we have ignored the much greater possibility, 98% as we calculated above, that a patient will be unaffected. When we use the RRR to describe an effect of treatment we have concentrated only on the people who will die and ignored all of the people who will live. And we don‚Äôt know which group a patient will fall into until they have the treatment. Therefore, using a description before the treatment that ignores the much larger chance that they will be in the group that survives regardless of the treatment (while still being subjected to the potential harms and side effects of the treatment) is very misleading. A true representation of the chances of being affected by a treatment is only apparent when we use a graph like the one below, a graph that shows us everyone (rather than just those may die). One can see how using the RRR to describe the potential effect of a treatment would be enticing, particularly if someone wanted to exaggerate the potential benefit of a treatment. For StopAttack3 the RRR was 20% while the ARR was 2%, a ten-fold difference. Therefore, people and groups that are trying to emphasize beneficial effects (groups that have a profit motive, doctors that are attempting to sway a patient in one direction, etc.). This is where the NNT becomes most valuable: as a tool to standardize communication. The NNT only uses the ARR and therefore when patients and doctors use the NNT there is no deception or exaggeration of impact. The concept of the NNT is highly intuitive, and once trained in its use, easy for most to understand. The core value of the NNT is its straightforward communication of the science that can help us understand the likelihood that a patient will be helped, harmed, or unaffected by a treatment. The rating system Our Therapy Approach: For every therapy NNT review, The site provides a color-coded summary for the reader use (borrowed from the traditional stoplight). As stated in their philosophy, the NNT group cares about benefits and harms that matter to patients, not researchers. Patients care about death and illness, not a laboratory value or CT scan finding. The site uses this focus on \\"patient-important outcomes\\" to guide its recommendations. The Green Rating Therapies rated green are the best you can get ‚Äì there is clear evidence of patient-important benefits, and these benefits clearly outweigh any associated harms. For example: Steroids for Asthma Attack: if you give steroids to 8 patients with asthma attack in the emergency department, you prevent one from having to be admitted to the hospital. There are definitely side effects to steroids ‚Äì high blood sugar, hyperactivity ‚Äì but these, to us, seem minor in comparison. The Yellow Rating Therapies rated yellow require more study. When the rating is yellow, the data is not conclusive or substantial enough to generate a clear rating yet. The ‚Äúyellow‚Äù therapies would benefit from large, randomized controlled trials (when possible and appropriate) to create a better sense of if they are helping the patients when these medicines are given or whether they are harming them. The Red Rating Red suggests that benefits and harms may be equal or equivocal; while there may be some benefits, the benefits don't outweigh the harms. One extreme example: if a medicine were to save 2% of people's lives, but cause strokes in 10% of people, it's hard to say that this medicine clearly is helpful. The Black Rating Black is the \\"worst\\" or \\"lowest\\" rating. Therapies rated black have very clear associated harms to patients without any recognizable benefit. One example: liberal transfusions for patients with anemia. Patients who received more blood transfusions did not do any better than patients with fewer (more restrictive) blood transfusions, but were much more likely to develop pulmonary edema, which can be life-threatening and require intensive care to manage. Diagnosis Approach: For every diagnostic evaluation review, TheNNT.com provides a color-coded summary of how helpful each sign/symptom/test is for that particular disease process; the darker the blue, the more important or helpful the criteria. Because of the way that likelihood ratios affect disease risk and odds, the site also made criteria that are unlikely to help change a patient's risk not usable with our dynamic risk calculators. You'll notice these values are in grey, and can't be clicked. These values are positive likelihood ratios less than 2 or negative likelihood ratios of greater than 0.5. Caveats There are downsides to trying to categorize everything into neat little boxes ‚Äì some therapies may not fit well into our schema. While TheNNT.com acknowledge it's not perfect, it still feels it's a useful way to get a quick assessment of the utility of a therapy. Some of the ratings are certainly open to interpretation, so again, we've done our best to pick a rating that we can all support and agree upon. TheNNT.com editors encourage the readers to contact them if they feel strongly that their assessment is wrong. https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/one-doctor-prescribing- data-improve-healthcare/ The website was launched in 2010.

Although since adopted by the GNOME project, it originally was developed by the Yorba Foundation. The purpose of this e-mail client, according to Adam Dingle, Yorba founder, was to bring back users from online webmails to a faster and easier to use desktop application. Pantheon Mail was a fork initiated by the Elementary OS community after the demise of Yorba, though at some point they decided to rewrite from scratch so that the only remaining references to Geary in the Pantheon code base are in some translations.  Features  * Supports Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, Outlook.com, and popular IMAP servers. * Mail organized by conversations. * Support for sending as another identity. * Full-featured HTML mail composer. * Support for reading TNEF attachments. * Fast keyword search with values like \`from:john\`, \`is:read\`, \`is:unread\` and \`is:starred\`. * Desktop notification of new mails. *GNOME Keyring integration to store passwords for email accounts. Implementation to support GPG had been started, but is still incomplete as of 2019.  Technical information  Geary internally uses an SQLite database to store a local copy of emails and for indexing. It uses a fully asynchronous GObject-based IMAP client library. One feature that distinguishes Geary from other open source email clients is its focus on the conversation view. Both Geary and Pantheon Mail are using gettext for translations. As of , Pantheon Mail has not been migrated to WebKitGTK+2 yet. The developers decided first to migrate the code managing the conversation view to use native GTK widgets (Gtk.CSS and Granite, a GTK+ library used as part of elementary OS). This offered several advantages, including minimizing the use of webviews, reducing the code, supporting hardware accelerated animations, and supporting RTL languages. They also removed the use of custom GTK bars like \`PillHeaderBar\` which were making the code complicated and difficult to read. Geary uses WebKit2 since at least version 3.32.0.  History  Historically, Elementary OS directly supported the project and Geary became the default application in that GNU/Linux distribution. On March 25, 2013, Jim Nelson, executive director at Yorba, launched a crowdfunding campaign on IndieGoGo to gather US$100,000 that would have been used to pay the 3 full-time Yorba engineers that were working at that time on Geary. Unfortunately, on April 23, 2013, only US$50,860 were gathered from 1,192 backers. The amount was not met and the campaign failed. According to the rules set by IndieGoGo, Yorba did not receive any of the money that had been pledged. After this failure, Jim Nelson declared in a blog post that the crowdfunding campaign was kind of an experiment to see if that route was enough to sustain open-source development. He reaffirmed Geary had been created to improve the Linux experience, and therefore had no chance of being ported to OS X or Windows platforms. As the Yorba Foundation had stopped its activities and GNOME had not announced any plans about this project at the time, the future of Geary was unclear. As a result, to these uncertainties, due to previous design disagreements with the old Geary team and because elementary OS was actually using Geary as the default mail client (though in a heavily patched version), Daniel For√©, the leader of Elementary OS, decided to fork the project on and continue with the development as a fork.; the project was renamed Pantheon Mail during the process. Pantheon Mail replaced Geary in elementary OS 0.4, which is codenamed Loki. In March 2016, Michael Gratton applied to become the new maintainer of Geary. His main goal was to try fixing pressing issues like the dependency on the old WebKit1GTK, collaboration with Pantheon Mail, better support for non- GMail servers, mailbox management, the account UI, extending search, etc. Contributing to Geary as a GNOME project requires the maintainer to become a GNOME member. After a discussion with Adam Dingle, Yorba's founder, both agreed to wait for Gratton to fulfill GNOME membership application requirements. In the meantime, Gratton will post his patches to the GNOME Bugzilla instance and Adam will commit them for him. On , version 0.11 was released,. Version 0.13 was released on February 18, 2019. In March 2019, with version 3.32, the version scheme was changed to match GNOME's release schedule (note the difference in even/odd version numbers).  Trivia  The initial name \\"Geary\\" coincides with the name of the Geary Street, because all Yorba's products were named after streets in San Francisco. However, according to a former Yorba employee, the application was not named after the address where Yorba Foundation was located. That was actually a coincidence. The first beta of Geary was released in May 2012, and Yorba was still located on Capp Street at the time.

It was built in 1930-31 by Isabella Greenway, who became Arizona's first female representative to the U.S. Congress in 1932. The Spanish Colonial Revival main building was designed by Tucson architect Merritt Starkweather. The entire complex comprises 25 structures, of which 21 contribute to the historic district. The buildings are pink stuccoed masonry structures with blue details, arranged in landscaped gardens with more pink stucco walls. The gardens were designed by landscape architect James Oliphant. Small structures surround the gardens, which are mainly landscaped with native Arizona plants. Description Greenway built a house in 1928 at the northwest corner of the site in a style that set the overall character of the hotel complex with stuccoed walls and a tiled roof. Six individual residences were built in 1931. The hotel was built in 1930 with the lobby, reception rooms dining room, kitchen and offices. Four casitas were also built in 1930 housing 23 rooms. The following year five villas were built, comprising 36 rooms. A pool and two supporting structures were added in 1937. The interiors feature plain white walls with corbeled arches connecting major rooms. Several dining and meeting rooms are themed. The Catlin Room features a collection of George Catlin prints, while the African and Safari Rooms contain souvenirs of Greenway's trip to Africa in 1931. The Arizona Inn was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 5, 1988. It continues to operate as a boutique hotel. Potter Place Across the street from the Arizona Inn is a small street known as Potter Place. According to David Leighton, historian for the Arizona Daily Star newspaper, the name derives from Dickson and Sue Potter who founded the Potter School, a preparatory school for girls. The Potters, who were from New York, began wintering in Tucson for their son's health and, later conceived the idea for a girls school in Tucson. After the first school year, they purchased the old Frederick Leighton Kramer home, across the street from the Arizona Inn, turning it into the main school building. The property also had on it a large pool built by a previous owner, James Wheeler, which would be used by the school throughout its existence. The Potters also had a few other buildings constructed and a house for themselves built on the property. Subjects taught at the school included Latin, drama, history, math, French, music, art, science and English. The pupils also had available to them a two-year course in the study of the Bible and Biblical history and Spanish and German could be taken with special arrangements. Individual swimming and tennis lessons were offered to students and occasional ski trips to Mt. Lemmon were allowed for students of ‚Äúgood citizenship.‚Äù In 1945, Dickson Potter bought property along North Craycroft Road, north of the old Fort Lowell, and constructed a ranch house and stables. Here, at Potter Ranch, the students received riding lessons from a master who resided at the ranch. There also were annual horse shows that showcased novice and advanced horse jumping, with the winners‚Äô names engraved on the Bob Locke Award. The Potter Ranch is now The Gregory School. In 1953, the school closed and the buildings were sold to the Sisters of Charity, a Catholic order. The main house of the school was torn down in 2015.David Leighton, \\"Street Smarts: Driveway to school became midtown street,\\" Arizona Daily Star, Oct. 26, 2015 References External links * Arizona Inn official website * Hotels in Arizona Buildings and structures in Tucson, Arizona Hotel buildings completed in 1930 Hotel buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Arizona National Register of Historic Places in Tucson, Arizona Historic American Buildings Survey in Arizona Tourist attractions in Tucson, Arizona Mission Revival architecture in Arizona Spanish Colonial Revival architecture in Arizona Hotels established in 1930 1930 establishments in Arizona Houses completed in 1928 ","title":"Arizona Inn"},{"id":"47096311","text":"The nave St Peter and St Mary's is an Anglican church in Stowmarket, Suffolk. It is an active parish church in the Diocese of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich and the archdeaconry of Ipswich. Its earliest parts date from medieval times.Paine, C. St Peter and St Mary's Church, Stowmarket, Official Church Guide, St Peter and St Mary's Church, Stowmarket On 28 July 1950 the church was designated a Grade I listed building by English Heritage. The nave, aisles and chancel date from the mid-14th century. The west tower is mid-15th century (\\"new\\" in 1453) as are the clerestory and the north and south porches. The spire was re-built in 1712. The church was restored in 1825, a vestry added in 1855, the tower restored in 1894 and the spire removed in 1975. A new spire, with St Peter's keys in gold upon it, was added in 1994 History  Origins The Domesday Book indicates a population of 650 for Thorney (Thorney Island) - the original name for Stowmarket, and refers to a \\"mother church\\", \\"a chapel\\" and \\"a market\\". It is likely that the mother church was an Anglo Saxon Minster church, with several clergy. This notion is supported by the large endowment of glebeland, , which supported the clergy. The Domesday book also mentions \\"the church at Stow\\" in the entry for nearby Onehouse. The entry for Thorney records that 23 of the 120 acres \\".. belong to a certain chapel which four brothers, freemen of Hugh de Montford [Lord of Haughey] built on land of their own beside the cemetery of the mother church and they were inhabitants of the parish of the mother church and built this chapel because it could not take the whole parish.\\" It is shown, in later wills, that the mother church of St Peter served the area of Thorney, which comprised the Stowupland end of the parish, Stowupland itself and Gipping. The chapel of St Mary served the inhabitants of the town itself. 15th century to 18th century By the 1460s the church had become St Peter and St Paul. St Mary's, which stood to the south-east of St Peter's was demolished in about 1546. The dedication of the parish church then became St Peter and St Mary. From about 1120 until the Dissolution in 1539, the Patrons and Rectors of the church were the Augustinian Abbey of St Osyth in St Osyth, Essex. This is the reason why, since 1120, the incumbent has been a vicar. After 1539 the Patrons were Lay Rectors who could earn an income from the major parish tithes. The upkeep of the chancel was the responsibility of the Rector and Patron. The parishioners were responsible for the upkeep of the remainder of the building, under the supervision of the churchwardens. Between 1628 and 1655 Thomas Young was vicar of St Peter and St Mary's parish and his portrait hangs on the south wall of the church nave. After 1800 The church was also the parish church for Stowupland until 1843, when a new district church was built there. Gipping remained a chapel to Stowmarket until 1968 when it was linked with Old Newton. Burials continued at Stowmarket, however, as the churchyard at Gipping was never consecrated. The owners of Gipping had their own chapel and burial vault at the east end of the north aisle until 1891 - which is why all the Tyrell monuments are at Stowmarket. The Tyrells owned Gipping Hall for about 450 years, being a branch of the family of Tyrell of Essex, and played a prominent part in the history of the country, as well as of the county. Exterior Main church Tower in 1986, showing spire stump The church is constructed of flint with ashlar dressings under slate roofs. The four-stage tower has with set-back buttresses and two-light belfry windows. There is a crenellated flushwork parapet. There is a remaining stump of an octagonal copper-clad spire formerly with a balcony. The south aisle has six bays and is fitted with three-light flowing tracery windows, between stepped buttresses. Outwardly the north aisle had seven bays, because of the addition of the east chapel; its fenestration is similar to the south. There are four-light aisle west windows. Those of the north aisle have three cusped roundels beneath. The clerestory windows are of double cusped lancets. There is a tall crenellated south porch with flushwork arcading and diapering. It has niches left and right. There is a similar north porch. The chancel, with two bays, has three-light 14th- century flowing tracery windows and a five-light reticulated east window. Tower and spire Tower, spire and entrance porch, from the south The tower and spire date from the 14th century. At ground level there are north and south arches, similar to those at Combs church, built to accommodate religious processions. Probably after the Reformation, the towers were blocked but were re-opened 1865. The external steps were also added at this time. The timbers at the top of the tower have been dated to 1342‚Äì63, as have those at the base of the spire. In 1674 the spire, of some , was taken down as unsafe. It was replaced with a new spire which incorporated a gallery walkway from the base, but this blew down in 1703. The west end of the nave and the north aisle were damaged in the storm. In 1712 a new spire was built. It was decorated with the Keys of St Peter and with the initials W.K. for the benefactor William Kent of Stowmarket. This was also removed, in 1975, as unsafe. The present spire was erected in memory of Clifford Cook, It was dedicated by Bishop John Dennis on 17 April 1994. The spire, which resembles the one it replaced, was designed by Andrew Anderson and won the King of Prussia Award. On 6 November 2011 the Bishop of Dunwich, Clive Young, dedicated a permanent ramp, new doors and a toilet, at the base of the tower. The main entrance to the church was thus restored to the tower. Interior Outline =Medieval and Reformation= North arcade The chancel is the oldest part of the church, dating from the late 13th century. In the 14th century it was given new windows on the east and at the side. The nave was rebuilt with a north aisle, narrower than the nave. At the west end of the nave a new tower and spire were constructed. The timbers in the tower have been dated, by dendrochronology, to 1350-63 for the top and to 1342-50 for the bottom. This dates the tower to the mid-14th century. The south aisle, clerestory, nave roof, north and south porches, and north chancel chapel were added in the 15th century. A will of 1442 describes the north porch as \\"new\\". The addition of the south aisle also saw the re-setting of the nave south wall doorway and windows into the new aisle wall. During the Reformation all altars, saint statues and glass or painted images, were removed. On 5 February 1644 the church was visited by Parliamentary Visitor William Dowsing who ordered the breaking down of \\"70 superstitious pictures and to level the chancel ..\\" Images from the ends of benches were removed, stained glass windows were destroyed and the cross-keys of St Peter were blotted out on the spire. In 1645 some of the vestments and the organ were sold. By 1811 the Communion Table was raised by two steps and had 17th- or 18th-century rails on three sides. The pulpit was positioned against the second pillar from the east on the south side, a typical 17th-century position. The interior had high box pews. Over the north aisle a gallery covered all but the two eastern bays, and over the south aisle a gallery covered all but the two eastern bays. =Victorian era= The nave, looking west In 1837 uniform box pews were installed in the nave and chancel. The south gallery was extended to the east end and the pulpit, by then three-decker, was relocated to the centre of the nave aisle at the east end. All the changes are shown on an 1843 drawing by Frederick Russell. Across the west end was a deep gallery covering the two western bays of the nave on both sides. This contained the organ, singers and National School children. In 1856 a major restoration was undertaken by Ipswich architect Richard Phipson, who removed all of the furnishings from the 17th to early-19th century. The pulpit was restored from the three-decker arrangement and was moved to its present position. The nave roof was restored and re-boarded with carved bosses. The church was re-benched and the organ and singers placed in the south aisle. The east and west windows of the south aisle were renewed, together with three of the windows on the south wall. Two of the windows west of the porch, in the Perpendicular style, were replaced with Decorated 14th-century-style windows to match the others. The lean-to roof of the north aisle was replaced with an arch-braced roof. All the windows on the north aisle were restored, with one entirely replaced, by Claxton and Gunn of Stowmarket. The Communion Table was raised. Most of the church floor, including the sanctuary was laid with encaustic tiles by Maw & Co. Gas lighting and underfloor heating were introduced, and in the tower the north and south archways were opened to allow for an entrance porch. In 1885 Norwich architect Herbert John Green designed a new organ-chamber and choir vestry. This linked the north aisle with the Vestry (now the Parish Office), replacing the aisle east window with an archway and providing a second arch into the chancel for the organ. Chancel The chancel shows a lavish use of stone and a high quality of carving and design, especially in the east window. This is accounted for by the patronage of the Abbey of St Osyth. The priest's door on the south, the string course below the window sills and the two shafts which flank the east window all date from about 1280. The earlier windows were replaced in the 14th century with those in a Decorated style, with internal hood moulds. The east window has Decorated reticulated tracery and to the right of the south east window is a crocketted 14th-century shaft. This is all that remains of an elaborate canopy which once stood over a sedilia seat beneath the window. In the 14th-century north doorway is a 15th-century wooden door with a carved leaf border. The doorway leads to a 15th-century chantry chapel which still has a piscina. On the south side there were also two aumbries (cupboards). There is a stone staircase which lead to a first-floor room - accommodation for the chantry priest. The arch into the organ chamber was built in 1885 as was the choir vestry which is lit by a window to the right. To the left of the Communion Table, prior to the Reformation, was a large statue of St Peter. The statue, together with a tabernacle, had been built from a 1455 bequest of ¬£6 13s 4d. In 1457 ¬£10 was bequeathed for the construction of a statue of St Mary, which stood to the right of the table. The chancel at that time also contained a statue and tabernacle of the Holy Trinity. On the north wall of the sanctuary was the Easter Sepulcher. Wills of the late 1450s also suggest there was a choir, two choir masters, song books and an organ. In the corner at the north-west is an opening which accessed a loft on top of the rood screen. The reredos was designed, in 1952, by Munro Cauntley of Ipswich, as were the communion table and rails, They were carved by Edward Barnes of Ipswich, in memory of Mary and George Reeder. Nave and aisles In the 14th-century Decorated period, the nave was rebuilt with a new north aisle, a western tower and spire. The night of the nave walls at this time can be seen from the feint horizontal scar above the north arcade, below the clerestory windows. The standard of work in the arcade piers is high and this is reflected in the hood moulds on both the nave and aisle sides of the arches. The piers are similar to those in the churches at Cotton, Orford and Wrentham. Until 1891 the chapel at the east end of the north aisle was associated with the manorial family at Gipping. Until the late 1430s the Lords of the Manor were the Mountseys. In 1406 Robert Mountsey bequeathed a large sum for the maintenance of his father's tomb, providing firm documentary proof that the north aisle was built in the 14th century. A narrower south aisle was added in the 15th century. The south side arches are taller and the design of the piers, arches, capitals and bases is different. The hood moulds and dripstones with foliage, however, reflect the north arcade. The old doors and windows were reset in the new south wall. Originally the two most westerly windows and the east window were in late 15th-century Perpendicular style, but these were eventually updated, to match the rest in 1865. The south porch The nave walls were heightened on both sides and the above the arcades six clerestory windows were constructed. The south windows are much taller than those on the north. Porches were added to the north and south aisles. The south porch, the grander of the two, has external flushwork decoration, three niches around the entrance, internal blank arcading and a holy water stoup. Above the central niche is a sundial. The north porch is built up against the dripstones of an earlier 14th-century doorway and externally has a niche over the entrance and a holy water stoup to the right. Wills of some of the parishioners show that, in the medieval period, there were statues or altars to Our Lady of Pity, St Margaret and the Holy Cross. At the east ends both of the aisle chapels had parclose screens around the altars: the north for St Mary and the south for St John the Baptist. Across the chancel arch was a rood screen with painted panels at the base. The open screen was surmounted by a rood loft and above this were figures of the crucified Jesus, with St Mary and St John on either side. Sections of the screen survive today in the font cover and pulpit. In the south-east corner of the north aisle are the original steps to the rood loft, which were blocked during the Reformation and re-discovered only in 1928. An 1843 drawing by Frederick Russell shows five bays of fan vaulting over the chancel arch. North aisle The aisle was built in the 14th-century Decorated style, with the door, arched tomb recess and windows all dating from this period. The two eastern bays formed the Gipping Hall chapel where the family vault, last used in 1891, was associated with the Tyrell family. Walter Tirel was allegedly responsible for the death of King William Rufus in 1100. His grandson Hugh Tyrrel took part in the Norman Conquest of Ireland. Sir John Tyrrell fought at the Battle of Agincourt. Sir William Tyrell was killed during the Wars of the Roses and James Tyrrell was the alleged murderer of the Princes in the Tower in 1482. The Gipping Hall chapel is formed by the two eastern bays. Medieval screens to the south and east remained until the 1865 restoration. There are internal hood moulds and string courses above and below the windows. At the west end the string course is only under the window. There is a trefoil-headed niche in the window jamb to the left of the door. The wooden door is medieval and in the right half has a \\"wicket gate\\". The west end of the aisle has three circular seven-foiled windows. Above them is a three-light window with delicate tracery. The three openings were blocked when discovered at the 1865 restoration, when they were unblocked and glazed. It is possible that their original purpose was as a squint to observe Mass celebrated at the North door from the market place, then adjacent to the west end of the church. Present furnishings Pulpit and benches The pulpit is that from the earlier three-decker arrangement, re-located in 1865. It incorporates, in its sides, panels and cresting, used as borders, from the 15th-century rood screen. All of the benches date from 1865, but four traceried bench-ends, with poppy heads, remain, possibly from 1500. The front pair also have arms with animals: a monkey, representing sinfulness, on the south and a lion, representing resurrection, on the north. Glass In 1721, when the church was visited by antiquarian Tom Martin, the east window contained medieval glass depicting Adam and Eve being driven out of Paradise. The window was gone by 1756. The side windows had images of St Mary, St John, the death of St Peter and the celebration of the Holy Communion. The remained until the 1865 restoration when they were removed. The main east window dates from 1875 and 1884 and is by the Camm Brothers, in memory of the Marriott and Oakes families. It replaced a window damaged in the gun cotton explosion of 11 August 1871. The window shows Christ in Majesty flanked by the four Evangelists: Matthew, Mark, Luke and John with their symbols in the tier below. There is also an east window is in memory of Arthur Simpson (d. 1872) who was Sunday School Superintendent. It contains a figure of Charity which may also be by the Camm Brothers. South-east window, by Clayton and Bell, 1878 The south-east window was renewed in 1865, with new glass, by Clayton and Bell added in 1878. The window in dedicated to Revd Henry Lewis who was vicar from 1861‚Äì67 and who oversaw the 1865 restoration. The images are those of Holy Week. The south-west window was altered in 1909, when the square top was changed to the present Decorated style. The glass shows the Resurrection Angel with a trumpet and is by Arthur Moore & Co. of London. The style is rich Arts and Crafts. The four south windows, dedicated in 2006, are in memory of Frank Lang (d. 2003) and his wife Hilda (d. 1988), with the western window containing the dove crest of the Lang family. Each has the monogram of the designer Helen Wittaker, the calligrapher Charles Smith and the studio of Keith Barley of Dunnington. The west window, re-glazed in 1997, has each piece of glass in the tracery inscribed with the names of, or a quotation from, the donors. In the three circular windows the glass was the gift of Stowmarket Rotary Club, the Arbon family and the Mothers' Union. Monuments *Under the eastern arch: Margaret Tyrell (n√©e Darcy, d. 1449), wife of William Tyrell of Gipping Hall. Box tomb removed in 1865. Shields above with 12 figures along sides and base. The arch terminates with dripstones carved as dragons and lions. *East wall, south side: Dame Dorothy Forth (d. 1641). wife of William Tyrell. The couple hold hands over a skull. Below are their three children who all died at an early age. William erected the monument and included himself as there would be none left to put a monument to him. Monument to Margaret English *East wall, north side: Ann Tyrell (d. 1638) aged 8 years and 6 months. *East wall, north side, above: Edmund Tyrell (d. 1799), by John de Carle of Norwich. *North wall: Margaret English (n√©e Tyrell) of Westminster (d. 1604). Margaret herself is shown at the left. Facing her, on the right, are her brother Thomas, sister-in-law Mary, and their ten children. *East end: Charles Blouse Esq. (d. 1724). An inscription in a n oval cartouche of drapery, surmounted by an urn, with a single angel head beneath. *West end: Thomas More Gent (d. 1754). A large rectangular monument with a pair of angels at the base. Portrait and hatchment hatchment to Revd Charles and Elizabeth Tyrell, 1774 On the south wall of the nave, adjacent to the south porch, hangs a portrait of Revd Dr Thomas Young, tutor to John Milton, who was vicar at the church between 1628 and 1655. A leading Puritan preacher, poet and Master of Jesus College, Cambridge, Young had been tutor to Milton from age 10 to 12. In 1625 and 1628 Milton wrote two letters to Young and in 1627 dedicated a Latin Elegy to him. Milton held Young in great esteem and the 1628 letter indicates that he intended to visit Young at Stowmarket. This brief mention, however, is the only evidence that Milton may have visited the town. The hatchment has the Tyrell Baker coat of arms and commemorates the 1774 marriage of Revd Charles Tyrell and Elizabeth, daughter of Edmund Baker. Charles, who was owner of Gipping Hall and Rector of Thurston, died in 1811. His half of the hatchment is thus black and that of his wife, who survived him, is white. Font and South aisle Victorian font The font is Victorian, but the wooden cover incorporates a 15th-century carved poppy head as a finial and parts of a screen around the edges. Near to the font is a 13th-century stone coffin lid, with a raised cross, that was found in the churchyard. The reredos to the War Memorial Chapel in the south aisle, is by Eleanor Gribble of Ipswich, in a pre-Raphaelite style using medieval gesso techniques. The centre panel shows the Adoration of the Magi, on the outer panels are the angels of Self- Sacrifice, Fortitude, Victory and Peace. Organ The 1901 Hele & Co organ The three-manual organ was made by Hele & Co in 1901 for Emmanuel Church, Paddington. In 1973 it was rebuilt and was moved to Stowmarket in 1993 by Bishop and Sons. It is a memorial to Hilda Margaret Lang, by her family. Administration The vicar is the Revd Michael Eden and the curate is the Revd Richard Stretch. Alan Lancaster and Tony Ingham are both readers. Marion Gray is churchwarden. The Secretary role is unfilled and the Treasurer is Geoff Marchant. St Peter and St Mary's Church is the parish church of Stowmarket and is part of the Church of England in the Diocese of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich in Suffolk. Bells The tower houses a peal of eight bells, with dates ranging from c.1460 to 1823. The oldest bell, the 8 cw 4th, is probably by John Danyell of London and is from about 1460; the 8th is by Miles Gray of Colchester 1622; the 7th and 3rd are by John Darby of Ipswich 1672 and 1691 respectively; the 5th is by Charles Newman of King's Lynn 1699; the 2nd by Thomas Osbourne of Downham Market 1791; the 1st is by William Dobson of Downham Market 1810; the 6th is by Thomas Mears of London 1823. The total weight of the eight bells is 4.5 tons. In 1894 the bells were restored by Bowell & Son, when they were taken from the tower and transported to Ipswich by horse and cart and then by barge on the River Gipping. The new oak frame that was re-fitted remains today. The fittings were completely restored in 1966 and three of the bells were recast. The ringer chamber in the tower contains a \\"gotch\\", dated 1780. This wicker-covered ale jug was originally used to supply of ale, as payment to the bell ringers.

The company was made of 5 employees: Jim Nelson (coder and executive director), Adam Dingle (founder), Charles Lindsay, Eric Gregory and Nate Lillich (software engineers).  History  In December 2009, Yorba Foundation applied to get the 501(c)(3) status. After some requests for clarification by IRS in 2010 and 2011, Yorba received on May 22, 2014 a denial for that tax exemption status. The reason for the rejection, explained by IRS, is that the organization makes software that can be used by any person for any purpose, and not for a specific community. Therefore, Yorba cannot be considered as a charity while the Apache Foundation, with exactly the same purpose, is considered as-it. Although this status would have helped, according to Jim Nelson, this deny does not hinge on Yorba existence. On October 31, 2013, Yorba moved from San Francisco's Mission District to the Financial District down the hill from Chinatown, still in San Francisco.https://web.archive.org/web/20130325073754/http://www.yorba.org:80/about/contact- us/https://web.archive.org/web/20140217193700/http://www.yorba.org:80/about/contact- us/https://web.archive.org/web/20150920025533/http://yorba.org/about/donate/ In April 2015, at the end of the month, the last Yorba employee, Jim Nelson, left the foundation. After a direct contact with Adam Dingle The reason for the end of activity is lack of being financially sustainable: funding ran out, donations did not match expenses and even if Yorba had received the 501(c)(3) status allowing to be tax exempted, they would still have probably to shut the project down.

It was followed in the final Bronze Age by the Proto-Villanovan culture and by the Luco culture. The continuity with the previous Polada culture of the ancient Bronze Age seems to be unbroken. The villages, as in the previous phase, are on stilts and are concentrated in the area of the Lake of Garda. In the plains appear instead villages with levees and ditches. The bronze metallurgy (weapons, work tools, etc.) was well developed among these populations. As for the burial customs both cremation and inhumation were praticted.

Lexus partnered with outside technology experts to aid in the creation of the SLIDE; Dietmar Berger, a magnetic levitation engineer, and Ludwig Schultz, a pioneer of superconducting levitation, were the main experts responsible for the hovering of the SLIDE hoverboard.http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/lexus-takes- wraps-its-mysterious-slide-hoverboard-n404201http://www.geek.com/news/lexus- slide-hoverboard-really-works-1630189/ Professional skateboarder Ross McGouran was the main rider of the SLIDE for prototype testing and also promotional riding as well.  Technology  The main focus of the SLIDE is the levitation of the hoverboard, achieved through the use of superconductors inside the board. Superconductors are conductors that have no internal resistance as long as they are kept below a certain temperature.http://www.superconductors.org/INdex.htm When a metal has no internal resistance, a current running through the metal will run forever without a power source. When a superconductor is subjected to a magnetic field, the superconductor aligns itself with the magnetic field and floats on top of it.http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/solids/meis.html Superconductors only have zero internal resistance when cooled to a certain temperature. In order to achieve this the SLIDE uses liquid nitrogen to cool it down to .http://chemistry.about.com/od/moleculescompounds/a/liquidnitrogen.htmhttps://www.theverge.com/2015/8/4/9091951/lexus- hoverboard-video Even though liquid nitrogen cools down the superconductors of the SLIDE, it also boils at . This makes it difficult to have a constant supply of liquid nitrogen to continually cool down the superconductors; the SLIDE can operate for an average time of only about 20 minutes on maximum liquid nitrogen onboard capacity.https://www.wired.com/2015/06/lexus- hoverboard-slide/  Track  The track built by Lexus for the SLIDE project is in Cubelles, Barcelona, Spain.https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2015/6/25/8846785/lexus-hoverboard- skatepark-its-real-not-a-drill The entire skate park has magnetic tracks concealed beneath a thin layer of wood. The magnetic track pulls the SLIDE along the path. All the uphill and downhill slopes of the track were specifically designed to ensure the magnetic field has enough momentum to pull the SLIDE.  Components The SLIDE board itself is made of natural bamboo and carbon fibre support structures. Its superconductors are composed of yttrium, barium, copper, and oxygen.

She is best known for her act of civil disobedience on June 27, 2015, when she was arrested for removing the Confederate flag from the South Carolina state house grounds in the aftermath of the Charleston Shooting. The resulting publicity put pressure on state officials to remove the flag, and it was taken down permanently on July 10, 2015. Early life and education Newsome attended Oakland Mills High School in Columbia, Maryland. In 2003, she was named one of the \\"20 Coolest Girls in America\\" by YM magazine. While still in high school, Newsome created a short animated film for which she won a college scholarship. She studied film at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. Career Film Her film Wake has won numerous awards, including the Outstanding Independent Short Film award in the Black Reel Awards of 2012 and the Best Short Film at the BET Urban World Film Festival. It has been screened at many film festivals including the 63rd annual Cannes Film Festival in France, the New York International Latino Film Festival, and the Montreal International Black Film Festival. Newsome was the first African-American undergraduate to be nominated for the prestigious Wasserman Award (Spike Lee having won the award as a graduate student). Newsome said that her experience as a black woman working in the horror and sci-fi film genres inspired her to become an activist. Speaking as part of a panel at Spelman College in 2014, she said, \\"The space that exists for many of us, as a young black girl, is so extremely limited so that you really can't go very far without being an activist, without being in defiance of something.\\" Activism =2013= Newsome was arrested in July 2013 at a sit-in at the office of then North Carolina House Speaker Thom Tillis while protesting North Carolina's voter ID law. =2015= She was arrested on June 27, 2015, for taking down the Confederate battle flag that was displayed on the grounds of the South Carolina State House in direct action. Newsome, age 30, while scaling the pole, was hailed by policemen who told her to get down. She responded, \\"In the name of Jesus, this flag has to come down. You come against me with hatred and oppression and violence. I come against you in the name of God. This flag comes down today.\\" As she lowered the flag and descended into the arms of awaiting policemen, she announced she was prepared to be arrested. Newsome and a man who police said was helping her, James Ian Tyson, were arrested. Onlookers applauded Newsome's efforts as she was being cuffed. As she was led away, she recited the 23rd Psalm from the Bible. The flag was raised again 45 minutes later. Both activists were charged with defacing monuments on capitol grounds, a misdemeanor punishable by a fine or a maximum jail sentence of three years, and taken to Richland County Jail. A judge set a $3,000 bond for each. Newsome's act of civil disobedience made international headlines and television news. By late afternoon, a crowdfunding campaign had raised over $60,000 for her bail. Filmmaker Michael Moore offered on Twitter to pay her bail and legal fees. Todd Rutherford, the minority leader of the state House of Representatives, offered to represent Newsome in court. NAACP chapter president Reverend Doctor William Barber II applauded Newsome's action, comparing it to those of Rosa Parks and other icons of the Civil Rights Movement. Colette Gaiter, an associate professor of art and social change at the University of Delaware, whose writing was republished by Time magazine, called the act \\"a significant piece of socially engaged performance art\\". After her release, Newsome gave numerous magazine interviews and appeared on talk shows such as Democracy Now and The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore. She also appears in the award-winning 2015 documentary, Bars4justice. Newsome's actions were criticized by several South Carolina legislators who said that they were in favor of the flag's removal, but illegal actions like Newsome's could hurt their goal to have the flag permanently removed. Calls for the flag's removal had been on the increase since the murder of nine people in the Charleston church shooting of June 17. Several days after her arrest, Newsome released a statement to Blue Nation Review revealing what propelled her to act. > I realized that now is the time for true courage the morning after the > Charleston Massacre shook me to the core of my being. I couldn't sleep. I > sat awake in the dead of night. All the ghosts of the past seemed to be > rising.

This was not a page in a > textbook I was reading nor an inscription on a monument I was visiting. A vote on the presence of the flag took place among South Carolina's House of Representatives on July 9, which resulted in the final removal of the flag the following Friday. The charges against Newsome and Tyson were later dropped. =2016= As a presidential candidate speaking at a Martin Luther King Day 2016 celebration in Charleston, Hillary Clinton credited Newsome for taking the matter into her own hands by \\"shimmying up that flagpole\\" as a step in the process. \\"Every year, you've gathered right here and said that that symbol of division and racism went against everything Dr. King stood for. We couldn't celebrate him and the Confederacy, we had to choose. And South Carolina finally made the right choice.\\" In February 2016, Newsome told Ebony that she had been motivated in part by her ancestors having been enslaved and subjected to racial terrorism in South Carolina. = 2017 = Newsome has continued to speak on race-related issues such as affirmative action. She has given interviews to newspapers and magazines such as The Crisis, Vox, and Marie Claire, made television appearances, and given public speeches at colleges and other venues. Following the deadly terrorist attack in Charlottesville, Virginia, on August 17, 2017, Newsome's op-ed piece and video commentary appeared in The Washington Post. Newsome is working on housing rights.

It is one of the 31 Upanishads attached the Atharvaveda, and classified as one of the Vaishnava Upanishad. It is presented in two parts, the Purva Tapaniya Upanishad and the Uttara Tapaniya Upanishad, which formed the main scriptures of Nrisimha sect of the Vaishnavas dated prior to the 7th century. The text is notable for asserting a fourfold identity, that Atman (soul, self) is same as Om, Brahman (Absolute Reality) and Vishnu Man-Lion avatar Nrisimha. The Upanishad opens with verses of the Rigveda. Its foundation of monism philosophy, as well its style is also found in other Vaishnava Upanishads such as those dedicated to Rama. The Nrisimha Mantra, with its four supplementary mantras, is enunciated with the epithet \\"mantraraja\\" (king of hymns). It has \\"Om\\" as the foremost hymn which is repeatedly emphasized throughout this Upanishad. The text discusses Nrisimha Mantra and related hymns. The text is also referred to as Narasimha-tapani Upanishad and Nrisimhatapanopanishad (). Date The century in which Nrsimha-tapani Upanishad text was composed is unclear. Farquhar dates it to be complete before the 7th century CE, because Gaudapada mentioned it. Lamb dates the text to \\"well before the 7th-century\\". Contents The Upanishad‚Äôs invocation and concluding hymns are prayers to the Devas, Indra, Sun, and Garuda as destroyer of evil, seeking blessings of eyes to see and offer obeisance and to enjoy a life span that the divine being ordains. Brihaspati, lord of prayer or devotion, too is invoked to bestow health, prosperity and peace. The Upanishad is presented in two parts, Poorva Tapaniya Upanishad which has five sub divisions which are also called Upanishads, and the Uttara Tapaniya Upanishad which consists of nine sections. Nrsimha Purva Tapaniya Upanishad In the first part of this Upanishad, Nrisimha, also spelled Narasimha, is described as an avatar or incarnation of Lord Vishnu born in the anthropomorphic form of half human and half lion and seen in two colours of black and golden red. He takes this form to put an end to the evil deeds of the demon who had a boon that he cannot be killed by a human nor by an animal. The demon was also the father of Prahlada, who was persecuting his own son for being a Vishnu devotee. In the second part, a long chapter, the significance of the Nrisimha Mantra as an important hymn to recite to overcome death and enjoy family life is emphasized. The key words used in the Nrisimha Mantra to worship Nrisimha are: \\"Ugra (fierce), Veera (heroic), Maha Vishnu, Jwalantham (burning), Nrisimha (half man and half lion), Trivikrama (one who measures the world in three steps), Bheeshanam (fear full), Bhadram (safe), and Mruthyu- Mruthyum (death and deathlessness).‚Äù In the third long section of the Purva Tapaniya, the Devas appeal to Brahma to teach them the meaning and benefits of Nrisimha Mantra, known as the king of all chants, which is set in anushtap meter (eight lettered rhythmic structure), which Brahma agrees to explain. Brahma explains that illusion or maya is personified by Nrisimha which in turn is identified as Om. In the fourth division, another long chapter, Brahma explains that the benefits of the Nrisimha Mantra, all of which is extracted from the Vedas, as a combination of: Pranava that is Om or AUM; Savitri an eight lettered hymn, which gives prosperity and wealth; Yajur Lakshmi, a twenty four lettered hymn which will usher fame and prosperity; and Nrisimha Gayathri hymn in which Vedas and Devas are imbibed. In the fifth division of this Upanishad, Brahma explains the importance of the Sudarshana Chakra, also known as Maha Chakra, which would fulfill one‚Äôs wishes and opens the way to moksha or liberation. Reciting this mantra daily without any aspirations would help overcome \\"fire, wind, sun, moon, devas, plants and poison\\". At the center of this Sudarshana Chakra, Om as the Taraka mantra of Nrisimha are inscribed. These are: Sudarshana (on six petals), Narayana (on eight petals), Vasudeva (on 12 petals), and mathruka (on 16 petals). The old Vedic gods are placed in the realm of Maya, that is outside the circle. Nrsimha Uttara Tapaniya Upanishad The Nrisimha Tapaniya Upanishad describes Sudarshana chakra mandala, which developed into protective amulets, a weapon (11th century, above), but also a means to meditate on Atman.D Dennis Hudson (2008), The Body of God, Oxford University Press, , page 482 The Uttara Tapaniya Upanishad which has nine sections, and starts with a request made to Brahma by the devas to enlighten them on the aspects of AUM and the soul or Atman. He explains that soul is an aspect of God which is more than all knowledge. In the second section Brahman‚Äôs four divisions, which match with the four letters of OM, are explained. The letters of AUM and reciting the Nrisimha Mantra would also enable understanding of the Turiya or fourth state of pure consciousness. In the third section explanation is provided on intense meditation of Om and subsuming everything in pure consciousness. In the fourth section, the meditation upon the soul as Omkara and Parabramha with pure consciousness of Pranava sound is elaborated. The fifth section explains that one who meditates using the Om symbol exists as Brahman and attains Brahman. It is also stated that worship of the soul is the same as reciting the letter AUM, which will result in realization of Brahman in the form of Nrisimha. Such a meditation will also make a person realize Parabramha as Parabramha Nrisimha. In the sixth section importance of the worship of Nrisimha by devas to over come the evil qualities within them is emphasized. Its four effects on them are explained. The seventh section deals with aspects of meditation. The eighth section pertains to the soul or Nrisimha. The soul is stated to be fully entwined with state of Turiya or pure consciousness. In the ninth section Prajapati explains the meaning of \\"AUM\\", that is the soul and its presence as a mere witness. The lion form is stated to be an illusion, a form beyond thought, which is seen in different forms due to ignorance. The sensory organs are not able to perceive it and hence it is not known even when it is apparently known. Prajapati tells the devas to perceive \\"Atma\\" as \\"I am it and it is me\\". The devas obeyed the commands of Prajapati and as a result all their illusions vanished.

Intended to accompany the fleet, she was designed for high speed on the surface. Although the navy was unsatisfied with her performance on the surface, the boat had a higher underwater speed than any French submarine before or during the following 35 years. Mariotte was plagued with engine problems during her construction and the navy spent years fixing the various issues before finally commissioning her five years after beginning construction. During the war, she participated in the Dardanelles Campaign, but had to be scuttled after she became entangled in the cables of a minefield on her first attempt to penetrate the Dardanelles. Design and description Mariotte was the winning design in a competition conducted by the Minist√®re de la Marine (Navy Ministry) in 1906 for a submarine (displacing that could accompany a squadron of battleships on the surface and had a submerged range of . The winning design, by Constructor, First Class (Ing√©nieur de 1√®re classe) Charles Radiguer, was optimized for good sea-keeping qualities and high speed with moderate buoyancy, a long, thin hull, and high freeboard. The most unusual feature of his design was the prominent forecastle that was built atop the forward part of the pressure hull, while the rear was virtually awash. This odd configuration gave the boat her nickname of toothbrush (brosse √† dents).Caresse, p. 81 The submarine actually displaced slightly more than planned, surfaced and submerged. She measured between perpendiculars and had a beam of . Mariotte had a maximum draft of and had a depth of from the bottom of her keel to the top of the conning tower. This latter was faired into the rear of the forecastle. Two lead weights were located in the keel and could be dropped in an emergency. Her hull was divided into nine compartments and she was fitted with five internal trim tanks, an internal central ballast tank and three external ballast tanks. She had a test depth of . Mariotte had two rudders, one above the waterline for submerged use and the other below the waterline for regular use. She had two sets of diving planes, fore and aft, to control her depth below the water. The boat was evaluated in 1914 and the commission felt that she was generally successful except for her surface speed and range. It noted that she had problems with a following sea as the superstructure rapidly filled with water, but drained slowly so that she was much heavier by the bow and would tend to wallow. It also felt that she was insufficiently buoyant and had mediocre stability on the surface.Garier, pp. 179‚Äì180, 188‚Äì189 For surface running, the boat was powered by two Sautter & Harl√© six-cylinder, diesel engines, each driving a propeller. When submerged each propeller was driven by a Breguet electric motor using electricity from two 124-cell batteries.Garier, pp. 181‚Äì182 Mariotte could reach on the surface and underwater. This latter speed was a record that would not be exceeded by a French submarine for 35 years. On the surface, the boat had a range of at , submerged, she had a range of at .Caresse, pp. 81, 83 She was armed with four internal torpedo tubes in the bow and two Drzewiecki drop collars in the forecastle. Two reloads were stowed internally, which gave her a total of eight torpedoes.Garier, p. 180 During World War I, the boat probably used Mod√®le 1911V torpedoes. These had a warhead and a range of at a speed of .Friedman, pp. 345‚Äì346 Construction and service Mariotte at anchor, Calais, 1912‚Äì14 Mariotte, named after the physicist Edme Mariotte, was ordered from the Arsenal de Cherbourg on 31 December 1906. The boat was laid down on 30 March 1908 and launched on 2 February 1911 with only the starboard electric motor in place. The port electric motor was under repair at the time and was installed from 3 May to 21 June and a brief series of trials were conducted. The boat was refitted and further repairs were made to the port-side motor, although continuing problems with her propulsion system often immobilized Mariotte into 1912. She was able, however, to conduct diving, torpedo and underwater speed trials in August and September 1911. The boat was lightly damaged when the air heater of a Mod√®le 1909R torpedo exploded in its tube on 27 December. Her diesel engines, three years delayed by problems during factory testing, were installed from 1 March to 28 July 1912. They were judged satisfactory after the oil sump and the compressors were changed. After repeated breakdowns, Mariotte conducted her testing of the diesels from 23 October to 11 December and she was finally commissioned (armament d√©finitif) on 5 February 1913 after a complete overhaul of her propulsion system.Caresse, pp. 81, 83‚Äì84 The boat was assigned to the 2nd Division (escadrille) of the Light Squadron of submarines on 16 January and she joined them at Calais on 11 February. Mariotte visited Brest on 20 February and was inspected by Rear Admiral Charles Eug√®ne Favereau. During the inspection the oil-fired galley stove in the forecastle exploded, lightly burning two sailors. The boat was in Calais for the visit of King Christian X of Denmark later in the year.Caresse, p. 85 The crew lined up at Mudros, July 1915 When World War I began in August 1914, Mariotte was transferred to the Mediterranean Squadron at Toulon where she patrolled off the coast of Provence. In July 1915, she was transferred to Mudros to attempt to penetrate the Dardanelles. After making a reconnaissance flight over the straits and having studied the reports of the British submarines that had successfully entered the Dardanelles, Lieutenant de vaisseau Auguste Farbre ordered his crew to cast off on the evening of 25 July. Escorted by the to the mouth of the Dardanelles, she rounded Cape Helles on the surface, but dived to avoid being spotted by a searchlight about an hour later and attempted to pass underneath a minefield near √áanakkale. The boat became entangled in the cables and when she surfaced in an unsuccessful attempt to free herself, she was immediately engaged by a Turkish gun battery at close range. Mariotte could not submerge because her conning tower had been penetrated by shells so Farbre decided to scuttle the boat and surrender. The Turks ceased fire when he signaled his surrender and so his crew was able to destroy documents and equipment before opening the seacocks to sink the submarine. The wreck lies off Cape Nara near a Turkish naval base at a depth of .Caresse, pp. 86‚Äì89  See also  *List of submarines of France References  Bibliography   External links * French Submarines: 1863 - Now World War I submarines of France 1911 ships Ships built in France Maritime incidents in 1915 World War I shipwrecks in the Dardanelles Scuttled vessels Shipwrecks of Turkey ","title":"French submarine Mariotte"},{"id":"47096577","text":"Chical C√≥ Department is a department of Argentina in La Pampa Province.

A first person view racing drone showing the drone's video perspective as it navigates obstacles FPV drone racing (where FPV stands for first-person view or first person video) is a sport type where participants control \\"drones\\" (typically small radio-controlled aircraft or quadcopters), equipped with cameras while wearing head-mounted displays showing the live stream camera feed from the drones. Similar to full size air racing, the goal is to complete a set course as quickly as possible. Drone racing began in Germany in 2011 with a number of amateur pilots getting together for semi-organised races in Karlsruhe.  Drone racing technology  FPV (first person view) flying means that pilots only see what the drone sees. This is accomplished by live streaming footage from a camera mounted on the nose of the drone. The image is transmitted via radio (typically 2.4 GHz or 5.8 GHz frequency, 1.3 GHz for distant transmission) to goggles or monitor worn by the pilot. The remote control, drone, and goggles are all connected via radio and must transmit with sufficient speed and reliability to allow effective control. FPV goggles on the market range from $50 to $500, with the more expensive goggles offering more and better features. Some of these features include a wide field of view (FOV), receiver diversity, digital HD video, head tracking, multiple frequency settings, and DVR (digital video recorder) recording functionality. While the pilot always requires goggles, some drone racing organizations insist they should also be used among spectators alike by simply switching the frequency to the channel of the racer one wants to watch. Any drone could be used to race, however competitive FPV racing leagues require drones to meet certain standards. MultiGP, defines community produced specifications and allows participants to supply their own drones increasing competitiveness and innovation. For competition, aircraft are typically separated into classes, separating winged craft from rotorcraft; and also categorising by size and power. The Drone Racing League (DRL) makes all of the drones used in its events in house; pilots are supplied with drones, backup drones, and parts by the league itself, not independently. DR1 Racing, utilizes an open spec class format that relies on each team in the series to supply their own drones, goggles and gear. Recently they added the Pro Class racing drone, which is currently the largest competitive drone racing format in the world. Racing drones are designed for speed, as opposed to a photography/video drone which is focused more on hovering. A photography quadcopter design will typically have four motors configured in an X-pattern, all equally spaced apart. A racing model will typically have its four motors configured in an H-pattern configured to thrust the drone forward, not up. Another specific characteristic of drone racing is the number of propeller‚Äôs blades. 3-blade or 4-blade (instead of 2-blade) propellers have a shorter diameter allowing for a smaller frame with increased acceleration and maneuverability capabilities. Because of their light weight and electric motors with large amounts of torque, drones can accelerate and maneuver with great speed and agility. This makes for very sensitive controls and requires a pilot with quick reaction times and a steady hand. BMW held the Drone Racing League‚Äôs 2018 Semi Finals race at their automobile museum, the BMW Welt, in Munich, Germany and sold out the event with 3,000 fans. Course design MultiGP provides community standards for their chapters to safely design their own courses and also generates individual pilot competition through their Universal Time Trial Track program which ranks pilots worldwide on standard measured courses. DRL creates complex, three-dimensional racecourses in locations internationally. The Sci-Fi inspired tracks stretch around a mile- long. DR1 Racing‚Äôs Champions Series is an outdoor racing circuit, flying in iconic locations around the world. Each location or race uses a mixture of environmental and manmade elements to create the course. The courses for the 2017 season include the Trona Pinnacles, the Mojave Boneyard at the Mojave Air and Space Port, the DHL Bonn Post Tower, Bunowen Castle in Ireland, Spike Island, and Isle of Man TT. DR1‚Äôs Micro Series uses indoor locations, with thematic elements. Others such as the U.S. National Drone Racing Championship tend to conduct their races in open areas with less catastrophic obstacles (flags and cones vs. walls and tunnels).

MultiGP is a global, professional, drone racing league with over 1000 chapters internationally including locations such as Australia, Asia, South Africa and Europe. There are no other drone racing leagues with the amount of registered pilots found within our community. United Kingdom The British Drone Racing League (BDRL) has recently setup and will operate a number of professional events. These events are currently being organized and will follow compliance from the CAA.  Funding  DRL is the only league so far that has established major outside sources of funding. DRL has raised more than $30mm in venture capital backing from entities across the sports, technology and media space. Some notable investors include: Sky, Liberty Media (also owners of Formula 1), MGM, CAA, Hearst, WWE, Lux Capital, and RSE Ventures. In addition, DRL has a number of high-profile sponsors, including Allianz, BMW, the US Air Force, and Swatch. It also has other lines of business, including a licensing deal with Toy State, a toy manufacturing company best known for their Nikko remote control car line. Finally, DRL has content licensing deals with networks around the world including ESPN and Disney XD in the United States, Sky Sports in the UK, OSN in the middle east, and the Fox Sports in Asia. This funding has been crucial to the development of the league, and allows them to advertise and hold their races in better venues that will attract larger crowds. Other smaller and less established leagues have found it difficult to find funding. At events like the one held at the California State Fair, funding comes from the state and from ticket sales at the event. Along with the difficulties of finding funding, it creates problems of finding good venues that create a challenge for the pilots and also have key turns and straightaways adding to the exhilaration of these events. US Army veteran Brett Velicovich has been involved in the launch of drone racing at the Dew Tour. Outside of DRL, and DR1 which has Mountain Dew as a sponsor, most smaller events are sponsored by FPV manufacturers such as Fat Shark, ImmersionRC and HobbyKing, DYS,T-Motor, EMAX, Team Black Sheep (TBS)  Podcast  * FPV Podcast - The first podcast to cover drone racing, pilots and key people growing the FPV Community. * Failsafe Weekly Podcast - podcast run by the following FPV pilots: Sweepings, Konasty, and Mr Steele.

However, it did not start to acquire that meaning until 1889, after a Rudyard Kipling story, and it did not do so universally until after World War I. Formerly, various professions vied for the reputation of being the oldest. Earlier senses The claim to be the oldest profession was made on behalf of farmers,\\"The farmer, therefore, can boast of being a member of the oldest profession\\" (Annual Report of the Secretary of the State Board of Agriculture, Michigan, 1878). cattle drovers,\\"He reminded his audience that theirs was the very oldest profession in the world\\" (Bury and Norwich Post, Suffolk, 19 June 1883, p.5. horticulturalists,\\"‚Ä¶ certainly we are representatives of the oldest profession of which we have any knowledge\\" (Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Ohio State Horticultural Society, 1890, p.35. barbers,South Bucks Standard, 30 August 1895, p.5. engineers,\\"‚Ä¶ we belong to the oldest profession in the world\\" (The Stevens indicator, vol. 9, 1892, p.167). landscape gardeners,\\"I need hardly speak of its antiquity, the oldest profession in the world\\" (Preston Chronicle, Lancashire, 9 November 1889, p.2.) the military,Speech by Lord Wolseley, Morning Post, 21 December 1895. doctors,The Clinic: A Weekly Journal of Practical Medicine, 1875, p.245. nurses,Nursing World, vols 21‚Äì22, 1898, p.123. teachers,The Ohio Educational Monthly, vol 57, 1908, p.294. priests,Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers, 1902. lay preachersIslington Gazette, 29 April 1902, p.4. and even lawyers.\\"A lawyer, then, is a member of the oldest profession extant; for as he lives upon the rottenness of human nature, the first human crime made room for a lawyer\\" (Alfred Butler, Elphinstone, vol 1, 1841, p.189). Perhaps the earliest recorded claim to be the world's oldest profession was made on behalf of tailors. The Song in Praise of the Merchant-Taylors, attested from 1680, which was routinely performed at pageants at the Lord Mayor's Show, London, if the current mayor happened to belong to the tailors' guild,Percy Society, Early English Poetry, Ballads and Popular Literature of the Middle Ages, vol. XIX (London, 1846), p.74. began: Of all the professions that ever were nam'd, The taylor's, though slighted, is much to be fam'd': For various invention, and antiquity, No trade with the tayler's compar√®d may be: After pointing out that Adam and Eve made garments for themselves, and were therefore tailors, it continued: Then judge if a tayler was not the first trade. The oldest profession, and they are but raylers,Bitter deriders or scoffers. Who scoff and deride men that be merchant-taylers. The Irish poet Henry Brooke (1701‚Äì1783) declared that humbugging (i.e. scamming) was the oldest profession:Samuel Johnson, The Works of English Poets, from Chaucer to Cowper, vol 17, p.428. Of all trades and arts in repute or possession, Humbugging is held the most ancient profession. The phrase had also been applied to murderers. In The Secret Societies of All Ages and Countries (1875),(London, Richard Bentley and Son), vol 2, p.324. Charles William Heckethorn, describing the Thugs of India, said: > The hierophant, on initiating the candidate, says to him: \\"Thou hast chosen, > my son, the most ancient profession, the most acceptable to the deity. Thou > hast sworn to put to death every human being fate throws into thy hand...\\" Association with prostitution A Courtesan Unveiling, unknown Indian artist, 1800s (Wellcome Collection) The phrase began to be associated with prostitution in the last decade of the nineteenth century following Rudyard Kipling's short story about an Indian prostitute, On the City Wall (January 1889). Kipling, after citing a biblical reference,Joshua ii. 15. began: > Lalun is a member of the most ancient profession in the world. Lilith was > her very-great-grandmamma, and that was before the days of Eve as every one > knows. In the West, people say rude things about Lalun's profession, and > write lectures about it, and distribute the lectures to young persons in > order that Morality may be preserved. In the East where the profession is > hereditary, descending from mother to daughter, nobody writes lectures or > takes any notice; and that is a distinct proof of the inability of the East > to manage its own affairs. In a scathing article on the morals of the aristocracy in the mass circulation Reynold's Newspaper, 22 July 1894,Page 4. the reference was repeated: > In ancient Rome, under the empire, ladies used to go to baths to meet a > certain class of men, while men resorted thither to meet a certain class of > ladies. The ladies belonged to what has been called ‚Äúthe oldest profession > in the world\\", a profession which is carried on in Piccadilly, Regent > street, and other parts of London with great energy every night ‚Ä¶ In the same year the Pall Mall Gazette12 November 1894, page 6. reported a speech in which \\"Mrs. Ormiston Chant ‚Ä¶ implored us to stand shoulder to shoulder and destroy what Kipling has called 'the oldest profession in the world'\\". The phrase was frequently used as a euphemism when delicacy forbade direct reference to prostitution. Residual usage of the phrase in its reputable sense There is some evidence that unworldly speakers (e.g. of the older generation) or unsophisticated audiences (e.g. in small towns or rural areas) were not at first aware of the phrase's newly acquired meaning. Thus for some time the following could be said in English newspaper reports without apparent embarrassment: ‚ÄúA certain proportion of the cadets were now leaving to enter the oldest profession in the world‚Äù (1895).(The profession of arms.) Speech of Lord Wolseley to the Royal Military Academy, Morning Post, 21 December 1895, page 2. ‚ÄúThis gentleman's name often figures high in local prize lists, and he is considered an enthusiast in 'the oldest profession in the world'\\" (1902).(Gardener.) Folkestone, Hythe, Sandgate & Cheriton Herald, 17 May 1902, page 7. ‚ÄúMr Petrie heard the voice of God and observed the working of His hand in ways that are denied to most of us. His speech, and especially his prayers, exhibited a rare consciousness of the beauty of holiness, and were fragrant with phrases of singular charm. As you all know, Mr Petrie followed the oldest profession in the world‚Äù (1915).(Gardener). Stirling Observer, 12 November 1915, page 8. \\"In conclusion, he [Lord Eustace Percy] reminded the teachers that they were the most ancient profession in the world, having descended from the Academy of Plato, and they must always remember that fact (1924).\\"Surrey Mirror, 19 December 1924, p.6. However, those 'innocent' uses of the phrase tended to die out as awareness of the newly acquired meaning increased; as did the appreciation that antiquity, of itself, did not make a profession respectable.

In 1940 she moved from Germany to New York City to escape the Nazi army and their ideologies. . Early Life Palfi was the daughter of German theater designer, Victor Palfi, and a Polish mother. She studied dance at private schools in Germany, and as a young woman she worked as a model, dancer, and actress, appearing in at least one film in 1926. In rejection of Germany's radical politics, she began to use photography and art to effect social change. Career In 1932, Palfi became an apprentice at a commercial portrait studio in Berlin and also began working as a freelance magazine photographer.Marion Palfi archive, circa 1920s-1983. AG 46. Center for Creative Photography, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ. https://ccp.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/finding-aid-pdfs/ag46_palfi_3.pdf Two years later, she opened her own portrait studio there. Fleeing the Nazis in Berlin, she opened her own successful portrait studio in Amsterdam in 1936. She then fled Europe for the United States in 1940 after marrying an American soldier . In the U.S., Palfi supported herself by working in a photo-finishing lab in New York City and began working on a large project of photographic essays celebrating American minority artists. Great American Artists of Minority Groups (1945) opened doors for her: after meeting Langston Hughes and Arna Bontemps, Palfi was asked to photograph for a number of African American Causes . One of her photographs was published on the cover of the first issue of Ebony magazine, featuring the Henry Street Settlement of New York's Lower East Side. Palfi was granted an award from the Rosenwald Fellowship in 1946. Between the years of 1946-1949, Palfi used photography to catalog racial discrimination in the United States. Palfi's photographic study on the State of Georgia was hosted as an exhibit around the United States in 1950, including Nashville, Detroit, Chicago, and Washington D.C. Her work was used to garner legislative change when \\"The American Parents Committee\\" showed her photographs to members of Congress. From the mid-1960s to the 1970s, Palfi taught photography in Los Angeles. Institutions where she worked included the California Institute of the Arts, the Woman's Building, UCLA Extension, and the Inner City Cultural Center. Palfi was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1967 and a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship in 1974. Photography Marion Palfi's work centered around equity, opportunity, and justice for all people. In her photo book There is No More Time: An American Tragedy, Palfi documented racism and segregation in Irwinton, GA, the site of the murder of Caleb Hill, the first reported lynching of 1949. Palfi's 1952 book Suffer Little Children focused on the living condition of disadvantaged children across the U.S., including the young inmates of the New York Training School for Girls. Palfi was a contributing photographer to Edward Steichen's landmark Family of Man exhibition in 1955. During her time traveling across the United States she was bothered by the amount of poverty and racial intolerance she was exposed. She also was confused by Americans lack to acknowledge of these problems within their communities. Palfi decided to use her camera as a way to document these problems and bring attention to them within the public eye. Using her new perspective on the topic of injustice and racial discrimination she was able to draw attention to these issues by documenting them with her camera. Palfi's photography explored the concepts of social injustices in America. She created many photographic studies that focus on racial injustice against African Americans, poverty in cities, and racial discrimination against Native Americans. She originally had trouble getting her photographs displayed or show cased because many Americans refused to address these social justice issues within their own society.  Activism  Palfi was the first photographer to arrive in Greenwood, Mississippi at the beginning of the town's civil rights protests in 1963. She photographed the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee offices after they were burned down, went to the residence of Dewy Green, and met with activists. As protests increased in violence, she was told to leave Greenwood. Following her time there, her photography was used by the US Department of Justice to support lawsuits against segregation in Greenwood and Leflore County. Palfi attended March on Washington (August 28, 1963). She additionally chronicled, in photography, the opening of Prince Edward County schools in 1964, and the end of Massive Resistance. Palfi marched at Selma in 1965 with Martin Luther King Jr. Marion describes herself as a \\"social change photographer\\" and she believed that art could and should effect social change. She used her camera as a tool to show the public the problems within their own society to an attempt to incite a movement of change. Legacy Palfi taught photography at the Inner-City Cultural Center in LA, before dying from breast cancer in 1978. Palfi's husband, Martin Magner, donated much of her papers to the Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona.

Biography   Internal Affairs (2012)  The Night Flight Orchestra started when Bj√∂rn Strid (Soilwork) and David Andersson (Soilwork, Mean Streak) were on the road together in North America in 2007. Bj√∂rn and David were bonding over what they considered \\"classic\\" or not, from rock n roll conspiracies to being arrested in a lobby with nothing but leather pants on. All those scenarios, fictional or real, needed a soundtrack. It didn't take long before bass player Sharlee D'Angelo (Arch Enemy, Spiritual Beggars) joined forces as well as keyboard player Richard Larsson (Von Benzo) and drummer Jonas K√§llsb√§ck (Mean Streak). Their goal was to reclaim the 70's/early 80's sense for classic melody. They released their first album Internal Affairs on 18 June 2012 through the Italian label Coroner Records and made their live debut on 1 August 2013 at Dina-scenen in Lidk√∂ping, Sweden. Due to their busy schedules with both Soilwork and Arch Enemy, they could only manage to play live for the first time one year after the release of Internal Affairs and only did a handful of concerts between 2013 and 2014 including a show at Sweden Rock Festival in 2014.  Skyline Whispers (2015)  In January 2015, The Night Flight Orchestra announced a new album release on 9 June 2015 via Coroner Records, and the addition of Sebastian Forslund (Kadawatha) on congas, percussion and guitar. Skyline Whispers was recorded at Nordic Sound Lab Studios, Skara (Sweden), engineered by The Night Flight Orchestra and Bengan Andersson, mixed by Sebastian Forslund and mastered by Thomas Plec Johansson at Panic Room Studios, Skara (Sweden).

The Night Flight Orchestra did their first European tour as a headline show in late 2017. On 15 December 2017, The Night Flight Orchestra have been nominated for a Swedish Grammy Award in the category Best rock/Metal for their globally acclaimed album, Amber Galactic.  Sometimes The World Ain't Enough (2018)  Less than one week after the release of Amber Galactic, singer Bj√∂rn Strid stated in an interview that The Night Flight Orchestra were likely to start recording their fourth album a couple months later, during Summer 2017, to be released in Spring 2018. On 5 April 2018, The Night Flight Orchestra announced that their new album Sometimes the World Ain't Enough was due to release on 29 June 2018.

History  Grandpr√© Abbey 1604 The abbey was founded in 1231 as a daughter house of Villers-la- Ville Abbey, of the filiation of Clairvaux, on a site where a grange of Villers-la-Ville had stood since the early 13th century, by Henry I, Count of Vianden and Marquis of Namur, and his wife Margaret de Courtenay Du Fays, Dominique - La Maison de Vianden; des origines √† 1337, Diplomarbeit L√ºttich 1986‚Äì1987. in memory of her brother Philip II, Marquis of Namur, who had died in 1226 during the Albigensian Crusade. The church was dedicated in 1232. Grandpr√© was a small community and never thrived or achieved prominence. The number of monks was never more than 20, even though the abbey had a dozen farms in the environs. Nor did Grandpr√© found any daughter houses. Some restoration work took place in the 15th and 16th centuries. In 1740 the abbey was plundered by Dutch troops. At the end of the 18th century the farm buildings were rebuilt.Blouard, 1954 In 1796, the abbey was suppressed and sold as national property to Jean-Baptiste Paul√©e, a financier from Paris and Douai. The conventual buildings had been demolished by 1807. In 1992 and 1997, the fa√ßade and roof of the mill and a subterranean channel were declared protected monuments, as had happened to the gatehouse in 1956.  Present day  Abbey gatehouse The remaining buildings, which are Baroque and Rococo in style, have been restored and are privately maintained. The abbey is now in private ownership and the buildings are not open to the public, but the gardens are accessible on demand, for a minimal contribution to the proprietor for his or her charitable purposes.

Hitler was appointed as Chancellor of Germany following a general election in January 1933. After the Reichstag fire on 27 February 1933, and elections that returned Hitler to power on 5 March, Hitler moved rapidly to consolidate his power with the passing of the Enabling Act on 23 March 1933, which allowed Hitler bypass the German legislature and pass laws at will. After the death of President Paul von Hindenburg on 2 August, a referendum was passed on 19 August, with 88.1% voting to confirm the merger of the post of President with that of Chancellor, and Hitler became F√ºhrer und Reichskanzler. The declaration states confidence in the leadership of Adolf Hitler, faith in and loyalty to him, and hope for the future.

The meningeal lymphatic vessels (or meningeal lymphatics) are a network of conventional lymphatic vessels located parallel to the dural venous sinuses and middle meningeal arteries of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). As a part of the lymphatic system, the meningeal lymphatics are responsible for draining immune cells, small molecules, and excess fluid from the CNS into the deep cervical lymph nodes. Cerebrospinal fluid, and interstitial fluid are exchanged, and drained by the meningeal lymphatic vessels. While it was historically believed that both the brain and meninges were devoid of lymphatic vasculature, recent studies by Antoine Louveau and Jonathan Kipnis at the University of Virginia, submitted in October 2014, and by Aleksanteri Aspelund and Kari Alitalo at the University of Helsinki submitted in December 2014, identified and described the basic biology of the meningeal lymphatics using a combination of histological, live-imaging, and genetic tools. In general, their work is thought to extend that of the Danish neuroscientist Maiken Nedergaard in identifying the pathway connecting the glymphatic system to the meningeal compartment. The role that the meningeal lymphatics plays in neurological disease is yet to be explored. It is hypothesized that they may contribute to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases of the CNS due to their role in connecting the immune and nervous systems. Background In peripheral organs, lymphatic vessels are responsible for conducting lymph between different parts of the body. In general, lymphatic drainage is important for maintaining fluid homeostasis as well as providing a means for immune cells to traffic into draining lymph nodes from other parts of the body, allowing for immune surveillance of bodily tissues. The first mention of meningeal lymphatic vessels can be attributed to Paolo Mascagni, whose anatomical work towards the end of the eighteenth century suggested their presence; however, this work received little attention or acceptance. In 1953, Italian scientist Lecco identified putative lymphatic vessels in post-mortem human dura. Further research in the 1960s described the existence of meningeal lymphatics , but these findings were not accepted by the field due to their limited methodology. Prior to the discovery of true meningeal lymphatic vessels, it was generally believed that the mammalian CNS did not contain a lymphatic system and thus relied upon alternative routes of waste clearance such as the glymphatic system, a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage pathway under the cribriform plate and into the lymphatics of the nasal mucosa, and arachnoid granulations to clear itself of excess protein, fluid, and metabolic waste products. Furthermore, the presumed absence of CNS lymphatics was an important pillar in the long-held dogma that the CNS is an immune-privileged tissue to which immune cells have highly restricted access under normal physiological conditions. Discovery Although, several studies proposed the existence of lymphatic vessels in the dura mater, the presence of the meningeal lymphatic system was accepted in 2015, when two independent studies published by Louveau et al. and Aspelund et al. provided convincing data using novel methods. Louveau et al. noticed an unusual alignment of immune cells along the dural sinus using a meningeal whole-mount technique. Using lymphatic endothelial cell-specific markers and electron microscopy, the authors found that the immune cells were not inside blood vessels, but rather were organized inside lymphatic vessels within the meninges, a system of membranes that envelop the brain and spinal cord. Aspelund et al. had discovered that in the eye, another immune-privileged organ, the Schlemm's canal is a lymphatic-like vessel. As Schlemm's canal was previously considered to be a venous sinus, the authors subsequently hypothesized that similar vessels may also be found in the brain due to its similarly immune-privileged status.. However, a recent study reported the absence of lymphatic vessels in the spinal cord dura of rat despite harboring numerous LYVE1+ cells . In an interview with Ira Flatow on NPR's Science Friday, Kipnis described the meningeal lymphatics as \\"well- hidden\\" when asked how, unlike the rest of the lymphatic system, they had remained unmapped into the 21st century. While many scientists study the brain parenchyma proper, Kipnis explained, his lab is relatively unique in studying the meninges: Visualization Example of a meningeal whole-mount taken from an adult mouse. Laying the whole-mount on a glass slide allows for histological analysis of the entire dura, including the superior sagittal and transverse sinuses. To visualize the dura mater using immunohistochemistry, the dura must first be fixed within the skullcap. It is prepared by cutting around the base of the skull (inferior to the post-tympanic hook) and removing the lower portion of the skull and brain. Following fixation, the dura can be dissected out of the skullcap as a single piece of tissue that can be utilized for histological analysis. In transgenic mice containing Prox1-GFP or Vegfr3-LacZ reporter genes, the lymphatic vessels may be visualized by fluorescent microscopy or after X-gal staining, respectively. The meningeal lymphatics may also be visualized non-invasively by MRI, using MRI contrast agents such as gadobutrol and gadofosveset to reveal the presence of the vessels near the dura mater. Biology Anatomy and route of drainage The meningeal lymphatic system is composed of a network of vessels along the dural sinus in the dura which express lymphatic endothelial cell marker proteins, including PROX1, LYVE1, and PDPN. The vessels extend along the length of both the superior sagittal and transverse sinuses and directly connects to the deep cervical lymph nodes. These meningeal lymphatic vessels drain down and exit the skull along the dural venous sinuses and meningeal arteries. Meningeal lymphatic vessels also drain out of the skull alongside cranial nerves and through the cribriform plate. Molecular profiling indicates that the vessels are conventional lymphatic vessels: they express high levels of PROX1, LYVE1, PDPN and VEGFR3, but low levels of PECAM1. Meningeal lymphatic vessels absorb cerebrospinal fluid and drain into the deep cervical lymph nodes. Several unique attributes differentiate meningeal lymphatic vessels from lymphatic vessels in peripheral organs. Compared to peripheral lymphatic vessels, the meningeal lymphatic network is markedly less complex, with far less tissue coverage and lymphatic branching. Furthermore, meningeal lymphatic vessels are generally smaller than those in the periphery and display a structural homogeneity along the dural sinuses, remaining thinner and mostly unbranched along the superior sagittal sinus while growing larger and more branched along the transverse sinuses. The meningeal lymphatic vessels are also unique for their scarcity of valves, which prevent back-flow of lymph. While the vessels in the superior parts of the skull were mostly devoid of valves, the larger lymphatic vessels of the basal parts only contain scattered valves.  Development  Development of the dural lymphatic system requires expression of vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGFC) and its receptor, VEGFR3 (which is the major signaling pathway for lymphatic growth). Meningeal lymphatic vessels increase in diameter when exposed to recombinant VEGFC and completely fail to develop when VEGFC and VEGFD signaling is inhibited during embryogenesis, indicating that meningeal lymphatics share developmental characteristics with peripheral lymphatics. In addition to its role in the development of the dural lymphatics, VEGFR3 signaling is required for lymphatic vessel maintenance in the adult meninges. Mechanical forces and shear stress generated by lymph flow are also required for later stages of meningeal lymphatic vessel formation and maturation. Physiological functions Confocal micrograph of meningeal lymphatic vessels and trafficking immune cells. LYVE1 (green), CD3e (red), and DAPI (blue) are shown. Like peripheral lymphatic vessels, the meningeal lymphatics serve both the tissue drainage and immune cell trafficking functions of the lymphatic system. Multiphoton live imaging experiments performed on anesthetized mice have demonstrated that the meningeal lymphatics are capable of draining fluorescent dyes injected intracisternally into the CSF, indicating that the meningeal lymphatics are capable of draining fluid from their surrounding environment. Histological analysis revealed that the meningeal lymphatics constitutively contain T cells, B cells, and MHC class II-expressing myeloid cells, demonstrating that meningeal lymphatic vessels are capable of carrying immune cells. Furthermore, tracing the outflow of compounds injected into the brain parenchyma have indicated that meningeal lymphatics function downstream of the glymphatic system. Genetically engineered mice which lack the meningeal lymphatic vessels demonstrated attenuated clearance of macromolecules from the brain. The uptake of tracers from the brain into deep cervical lymph nodes was completely abrogated. However, brain interstitial fluid pressure and water content were unaffected. These data suggested that meningeal lymphatic vessels are important for the clearance of macromolecules from the brain parenchyma, but in physiological settings the brain can compensate in solute clearance. Role in disease The role that the meningeal lymphatics play in diseases of the nervous system is an area of active research, particularly for neurological disorders in which immunity is a fundamental player, such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Hennekam syndrome, and Prader- Willi syndrome. Impaired clearance of ISF waste has been associated with accelerated accumulation of toxic amyloid beta, the main component of amyloid plaques in AD.  Significance  The paper by Jonathan Kipnis and his postdoctoral fellow Antoine Louveau was published in 2015 and by 2017, this paper had been cited more than 1200 times. The discovery of meningeal lymphatic vessels has attracted attention from many sources, and was touted as a scientific breakthrough in lists such as Scientific Americans \\"Top 10 Science Stories of 2015\\", Science Magazines \\"Breakthrough of the Year\\", Huffington Post's \\"Eight Fascinating Things We Learned About the Mind in 2015\\" and the National Institutes of Health's director Francis Collins's year end review.

She captured one French vessel in a single-ship action before she was wrecked near Cape Canaveral, Florida, in 1799. French service and capture Amarante was the name ship of a two-vessel class of 12-gun brigs built to a design by Pierre-Alexandre- Laurent Forfait. She was also the first vessel that Joseph-Augustin Normand built at Honfleur for the French Navy. Between February 1794 and December, she was under the command of enseigne de vaisseau Jacques-Philippe Delamare and escorted convoys from to Le Havre to Brest.Fonds Marine, p.55. Between February 1795 and May, she escorted convoys between Saint-Malo and Dieppe, and performed fisheries protection duties for the Dieppoise fishermen.Fonds Marine, p.84. She then protected the herring fisheries in the Channel. Delamare was suspended in 1798 as a terrorist by order of the representative of the people Boissier. He was reinstated some months later and sent to Brest. A decree of the Public Safety Committee, dated 22 September, confirmed him in command of Amarante. On 1 March 1797 Amarante was at La Hogue roads undergoing repairs.Fonds Marine, p.144. captured Amarante off Alderney on 31 December 1796. The letter in the London Gazette describes her as a brig of twelve 6-pounder guns, and nine men. She was sailing from Le Havre to Brest. She had no casualties. British service Amarante arrived at Portsmouth on 2 January 1797. In August 1797 the Royal Navy commissioned her as Amaranthe under Commander Francis Vesey, and she then underwent fitting until February 1798. Vesey sailed her for Jamaica in July 1798. However, on 29 August, she and recaptured the British East India Company \\"extra ship\\" Britannia, Stewart, master. Britannia had been sailing from Bengal to London when the French privateer Huron captured her. In November, and Amaranthe captured the French 4-gun privateer Petite Fran√ßaise.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 39, Appendix. On 13 April 1799 Amaranthe captured the French letter of marque schooner Vengeur after a long chase and sharp fight. Vengeur had only six 4-pounder guns, half Anmaranthes armament, but resisted fiercely for an hour and eight minutes. French casualties were 14 killed and 5 wounded (one of whom died later and another of whom was expected to die), out of 36 crew and passengers on board; British casualties were one man killed and four wounded. Vengeur had been carrying a cargo of flour from Santiago de Cuba to J√©r√©mie, Haiti. She had been a privateer on her previous cruise, and Vesey described her as a \\"very fine Copper-bottomed Schooner, capable of mounting Ten Carriage Guns, nearly new, and fails uncommonly fast\\". Vesey received promotion to post captain on 16 September.Marshall (1824), Vol. 2, pp.237-8. Commander George Blake then replaced Vesey as captain of Amaranthe. Fate On 25 October 1799 Amaranthe was cruising off the coast of Florida. That evening she went aground. Efforts to free her were unavailing and the officers and crew took to the boats and rafts, with the last men having to swim for shore. Twenty-two men drowned. Morning revealed that the survivors had landed some leagues north of Cape Canaveral. The survivors had to walk for 13 days along the shoreline until they reached the Spanish settlement at Fort Matanzas on 8 November, where they were declared prisoners of war. The next day the Spaniards delivered the British to St Augustine. From there they traveled to Charleston, and on to Jamaica. The court martial took place on on 30 December 1799 at Port Royal Harbour, Jamaica. The court martial acquitted Blake, his officers and crew of the loss of Amaranthe. However, the board found Blake blameable for having sailed west after dark at too high a speed and for failing to take frequent soundings with the lead. The board also ordered seaman Daniel Day to spend a month in jail for having prevaricated in his evidence and having wasted its time. Citations and references Citations References Fonds Marine.

Each cat has a unique name, personality, and appearance. The player may rename the cats after they have encountered them. Rare cats have a unique interaction with their items. Many of the rare cats in the English version of the game are named after famous people, both fictional and non-fictional, with the names of the cats being puns, like Lady Meow Meow (Lady Gaga), Mr. Meowgi (Mr. Miyagi), Chairman Meow (Chairman Mao), Guy Furry (Guy Fieri), Saint Purrtrick (Saint Patrick), Xerxes IX (Xerxes I), Hermeowne (Hermione Granger), Billy the Kitten (Billy the Kid), (Don Carlos), and Joe DiMeowgio (Joe DiMaggio, complete with megaphone and baseball). Development Yutaka Takazaki, the developer of the game, said that his goal was to create a game that even children could enjoy without a significant investment of skill or time. While he loves cats himself, he has said that \\"to be honest, I do not know why this game is so popular.\\" The game \\"was made between the development of other applications.\\" Originally, it was software for players who like cats to just watch and enjoy, and could be completed in 2‚Äì3 weeks for free. Takazaki says, \\"We're not going to put cheats or complexity in it, and we would like to pursue a game that can be enjoyed with only simple operations.\\" Release On October 30, 2015, an English version of the game, titled Neko Atsume: Kitty Collector, was released on the Android and iOS app stores. As of version 1.4.5, players can switch between the Japanese and English versions of the game any time they want by using the in-game menu. Even before the English version, guides were written for English-speaking users to play the game. In version 1.5.5, there is a chance that the player's yard will be covered in snow. The snow event typically lasts for 24 hours and changes the appearance of the yard as well as the background music. The player also has the opportunity to get a new rare cat, Frosty. Version 1.6.0 was released on March 24, 2016. This version added two new common cats and two new rare cats, more toys, and introduced the \\"gallery\\" where players can buy wallpapers for their phones with gold fish.

Early life O'Mahony was born about 1840 in Macroom, County Cork, Ireland but later moved to Dublin. He grew up in a time where starvation and disease were commonplace, particularly in the countryside, during the period commonly referred to as the Potato Famine. Given his later pursuits it is fair to say he came from a family which either owned land or had the money with which to educate him.

Early life Davies was born in 1904 in Pencader, Carmarthenshire, a small village in Wales. He was the son of two farmers and attended a local primary school. After finishing primary school, Davies received a full ride scholarship to Llandysul County School in the neighbouring town of Llandysul. There he became friends with Evan James Williams, a future professor of physics at Aberystwyth University and member of the Royal Society. In 1921, he enrolled in Aberystwyth University. He would graduate with a Bachelor of Science with honours in the field of applied mathematics. After graduation he went to Swansea University where he studied pure mathematics and received his master's degree. Davies would move to Rome in August 1926 to study with the leading expert on absolute differential calculus, Tullio Levi-Civita. There he received his doctorate. Career In 1930, after a short academic break due to poor health, Davies accepted a position as an assistant lecturer at King's College London. There he was promoted twice, first to Lecturer in 1935, and later to Reader in 1946. Davies was affected by the evacuation of King's College due to the London Blitz and was forced to temporarily relocate to the University of Bristol. After the conclusion of the Second World War and his subsequent promotion to Lecturer; Davie would become the chair of mathematics at the University of Southampton.

It was built from 1878 to 1879. It is also known as Railway Administration Building, Railway Store, and Tarpaulin Shop. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  This building, the oldest remaining on the original North Ipswich Railway Workshops site, was built in 1878-9 by Ipswich contractors, McGregor and Brown. It was initially used as a store. It was later used for administration and then as a tarpaulin store. In 1990, the tarpaulin store was converted into the Railway Historical Centre and was used for housing railway archival material and for other related functions.  Description  This is a fine example of a Victorian warehouse constructed of load- bearing brick on two levels. Outwardly, the building is a symmetrical gable ended structure with a centrally projecting transverse gable to the northern and southern facades. The formal entry is defined by a round headed arch and stairs leading up from The Terrace. Immediately opposite this on the southern side, is an upper level loading platform. The symmetry of the building is reinforced by equally spaced segmental arch windows on both levels, and ridge ventilators at each end of the corrugated custom orb profile roof. Internally, the upper floor is dominated by Queen Post trusses which meet at the gable crossing with cruciform trusses. Along each end of the bottom chord are support rails with rope eyelets for suspension of tarpaulins. The original windlass is supported at the centre trusses for hoisting goods to and from the upper and lower levels through a timber trapdoor. From the lower level, two large doors lead to the southern aligned railway tracks, and a tramway runs through the centre of the floor longitudinally. There is evidence of earlier service entry doors or cartways entering from the Terrace side. The main timber floor frame is supported on sturdy hardwood columns with timber headstocks. Each bearer is jointed over the headstock with a scarfed joint and square timber key. An early office compartment exists at the western end of the upper floor, constructed with a raised timber floor and tongue and groove timber partitions. At the eastern end there is a single storey timber frame extension which is not original.  Heritage listing  Railway Historical Centre was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Railway Historical Centre is the only remaining building on the southern section of the site, it is evidence of the first period of development of the railway workshops 1864-1885. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The building retains evidence of its various uses as stores, administration, and tarpaulin store. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. It is fine example of a Victorian brick and stone warehouse and is of particular architectural merit.

It is also known as Mihi Junction and Mi Hi Creek. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 16 July 2010.  History  The Mihi Creek site is a cultural landscape created as a result of mixed within the area since the early 1860s. Past use of the area is divided into two distinct though connected historical phases - the use of the area by Queensland Railways for Queensland's first main line railway, and then as an evolving coal mining and coke manufacturing operation in 1871, concluding around 1960.  Railway Operations (1865 - 1875)  Queensland's colonial government fostered the development of railways as a means of developing the State and providing social benefits. It was argued that rail would reduce freight costs and save travel time for passengers. An added incentive for rail development in Queensland was the very poor state of the roads. In wet weather especially, this hampered the transport of freight. The Ipswich reach of the Bremer River was chosen as the eastern terminus of the first main line railway instead of Brisbane because of the importance of Ipswich to Darling Downs pastoralists. Ipswich was becoming a major inland port and was located at the intersection of important transport routes to the Darling Downs and Upper Brisbane Valley. The Chief Engineer responsible for construction of the railway was Abraham Fitzgibbon, later to be engaged as Queensland's first Commissioner for Railways. Charles Fox and Son, an engineering firm based in England, were appointed as consulting engineers and Peto, Brassey and Betts, contractors with worldwide railway construction experience, were engaged to construct the line. Construction of the first section of main line between Ipswich and Bigge's Camp (now Grandchester) officially commenced on 25 February 1864 with the turning of the first sod at North Ipswich by Lady Diamantina Bowen. The original route followed the north bank of the Bremer River crossing Mihi Creek and Iron Pot Creek and joining the route of the present main line at Wulkuraka. The line was officially opened on 31 July 1865. The first bridge over Mihi Creek was one of four bridges constructed on the line between Ipswich and Grandchester. The embankment of the Mihi crossing was exposed to flood waters from the Bremer River and Mihi Creek and began to subside after a flood in April 1867. The crossing was notorious for the sharp reverse curves in the approaches to the bridge. In May 1868, the Mihi deviation was completed at a cost of about and opened for traffic. This crossed the creek above the flood level about further up stream and it followed a gentler curve. The old line was removed and the bridge was dismantled and stored. The line was used until 1875 when a new line was opened to the south across the Bremer River, cutting out the original first six kilometres from the North Ipswich Railway Workshops and through Wulkuraka. However, a portion of the line between North Ipswich and Wulkuraka was retained to service the railway workshops and also for the use of coal mining and coke manufacture that were then occurring at Mihi Creek.  Coal Mining and Coking Operations (1864 - )  The discovery of coal in Queensland dates from 1825 when outcrops were observed by Major Edmund Lockyer on the banks of the upper Brisbane River. Two years later, when Ipswich was settled as a convict outstation, known as Limestone, the presence of coal was noted between the convict settlement and Brisbane by Captain Patrick Logan. The following year, explorer Allan Cunningham also marked several outcrops on the Bremer River on his survey map for New South Wales Governor Ralph Darling. Coal was one of the first minerals in Queensland to be commercially mined. Mining originally commenced at Goodna in 1843 with the West Moreton Coalfield at Ipswich following in the early 1850s. Primary sources of historical information for coke manufacture in the West Moreton field, and across Queensland generally, are scarce as the early regulation of Queensland's mining industry was focused mainly on gold mining. Coal mining was not regulated until the 1880s with the passage of the Mines Regulation Act 1881, the Mineral Lands Act 1882 and the Mineral Lands (Coal-Mining) Act 1886. The Mines Regulation Act allowed the appointment of mines inspectors and the first was appointed in January 1882. While these inspectors reported regularly on the operations of coal mines, coke manufacture was not covered by the definitions of the Act and therefore not considered officially part of the mining industry and went largely unreported. Coal mining was not covered by specific legislation until 1925, and these regulations also made no mention of coking. This has led to no systematic record keeping of coke manufacture in Queensland - especially concerning production numbers, value, equipment used, people employed, or any other detailed characteristic. Information contained in Queensland government records is fragmentary - except for State owned enterprises such as those at Bowen and Mount Mulligan in northern Queensland. A by-product of coal mining, coke was usually regarded as a somewhat unimportant side industry to the actual mining of coal. Coke is used as both a fuel and as a reducing agent in smelting ore and is produced from baking bituminous coal in ovens at temperatures as high as . Coke manufacture became an important extractive industry from the late 1860s with the introduction of mechanically driven transportation, such as steam- powered ships and trains. Sites for coking of coal were most often located adjacent to transport systems, road, rail or water. In 1871, the Eastwood Mine opened at Mihi Creek and was named after its owner, John Eastwood. The Eastwood Mine was worked during the 1870s and into the early 1880s. Due to the owner's interest in other mines it then laid idle for several years until it was sold to John Wright and Brydon, Jones & Coy in 1884 who renamed the site to Mihi Mine. A short rail spur-line was built, connecting their mining rail/tram infrastructure to the Ipswich railway (presumably to the 1868 main line alignment of the Ipswich - Grandchester rail line). Twelve coke ovens, known as the Mihi Ovens, were soon constructed on the hillside above Mihi Creek. Coke ovens erected on the West Moreton Coalfield were exclusively of the beehive type, so called because of their domed appearance. Beehive coke ovens consisted of a brick dome with a small circular opening (an exit flue) at the apex, and a larger arched opening at one side to permit charging and drawing. They were usually constructed in double rows known as batteries. The space between ovens was usually filled with rubble and earth to provide insulation and the whole battery surrounded by a stone retaining wall to resist the outward thrust of the brick domes. The Mihi Ovens remained in use until 1890/1 when Wright's attention was diverted a new coal development at the New Bishop Mine located nearby. It was 1908 before the site was mined again, this time by Paul Francis, a Cornish miner who had been working in the Ipswich area since the 1870s. He named his venture the Francis Mine, constructed a horse whim for hauling loaded coal skips out of his tunnel, sank an air shaft to the workings and erected bunkers of \\"60-tonnes capacity\\". The exact location of Francis' first tunnel is not known but in 1917 a second tunnel was driven into the hillside probably below Viking Street. A siding was also laid which connected to the railway workshops which terminated below the tunnel. In 1923 Francis sold the site to a partnership of miners and a barrister who created and floated the company, Klondyke Collieries Limited. As Klondyke Collieries Limited, coke production at the site flourished. The horse whim was replaced by an electric winder, and air shaft sunk to the workings and fitted with an electric propeller fan, a screening and crushing plant was erected, and power supplied by the Electric Supply Company Limited. The ovens were used throughout the 1930s. By 1942 several new beehive ovens had been constructed to meet the increased demand for coke for smelting purposes though the actual market for this coke remains unknown (see also Klondyke Coke Ovens). In 1945 and 1946, Klondyke and Bowen in northern Queensland were the only coke producers in Queensland, with Klondyke turning out approximately a sixth of Queensland's coke production. In 1948 the site changed hands again and was renamed Moreton Colliery and worked until the early 1950s when the pit's supply was exhausted. Bryce (2009:5) recalls that the ovens were still being used as late as 1960. After the closure of the site, coke production was taken over by the nearby Haighmoor site which remained in production for a further 15 years as southern Queensland's only coke works (Klondyke Coke Ovens).  Description  Visitor facilities, 2015 Park sculpture, 2015 The Mihi Creek heritage site is located at North Ipswich in a grassy expanse of broken, undulating land that slopes down to a bend in the Bremer River. Identifiable remains of coke manufacturing are concentrated in the area north of Mihi Creek in Lot 5 on AP3320. The remnants of the railway are located on both sides of Mihi Creek but particularly evident in Lot 34 on SL4200 and Lot 1 on RP146565. The route of Queensland's first main line railway is featured in original plans held by Ipswich Railway Workshops Museum for the railway. The former railway embankments comprise two sets of raised embankments on Lot 1 on RP146565 (the 1864 alignment) and on Lot 34 on SL4200 (the 1867/8 alignment) and are visible either side of Mihi Creek. Both sets of embankments run in arcs which are roughly parallel to the curve of the bank of the Bremer River to the south. The larger of the two embankments (the 1867/8 alignment) runs in a gentler curve and is located furthest from the river. The embankments terminate at steep slopes on either side of Mihi Creek where the bridge abutments once stood. On the western side the embankments are readily discernable, rising in height to the edge of the creek. To the east the embankments tend to merge with rising ground and are less identifiable. At the tops of the embankments where the soil is thin, unformed sandstone blocks are visible. The tops of these blocks are at ground level. A number of blocks are also located at the south western corner of the site near where the smaller embankment crosses a gully. A block bearing pick marks is also located in this area. The remains of an unknown number of broken bridge piles from the 1867/8 bridge remain in situ in the bed of Mihi Creek on Lot 34 on SL4200. Six piles have however been removed to allow the installation of foundations for a new bridge crossing the creek at the same point. From the piles removed, it was noticed that these had sharpened ends reinforced with strips of cast iron and matched the description given for the bridge in the original design drawings. Dressed sandstone blocks were also identified on the western approaches of the 1864-5 bridge as was a suspected buried sandstone culvert (or the remains of one) on the 1864 line west of Mihi Creek within Lot 1 on RP146565. These remains consist of several cut sandstone blocks, embedded in the side of the 1864 embankment. Later buildup of solids on top of this spot, including the installation of garden beds, may conceal more remains from the culvert. A culvert is shown at this location on early plans for the railway. Additional culverts of this style still exist in the nearby area - at Wulkuraka to the west (Sandstone Railway Culvert, Wulkuraka) and directly east of the site across Mihi Creek at North Ipswich (Sandstone Railway Culvert, North Ipswich). The first battery of beehive ovens, the \\"Mihi Ovens\\" built c.1884 by John Wright and Brydon and Jones & Coy, then owners of the Mihi Mine, is located on Lot 5 on AP3320 immediately north and west of the Klondyke Coke Ovens. The ovens were recorded by Whitmore (1983) and re-located by DERM (2010). In 1987 Whitmore noted a programme of tipping and re-contouring in this area which threatened to engulf the ovens. This fill event has been verified by Department of Environment and Resource Management test excavations. The entrances of three ovens from this original bank of ovens are now partly exposed on the slope situated between the upper and middle terraced areas to the immediate west of the Klondyke Coke Ovens. The full extent and dimensions of the ovens remains unclear, though this battery has been described as consisting of 12 ovens. Their orientation is most likely similar to other beehive ovens on the Ipswich - West Moreton field, being either back-to-back or in a stagger pattern. The space between each oven would be filled with earth or rubble for insulation, and evidence of compacted orange clay was recorded in DERM during test excavations in the area. Evidence of a stone retaining wall surrounding the ovens has not been re-located, but sections may still survive. The remains of a two small brick structures of unknown function are situated immediately north of the oven sites. Unknown Structure 1, located closest to the ovens and immediately above their adjacent rail spur cutting, is constructed of mortared orange bricks and measures approximately . Metal artefacts of unknown function remain in situ within the structure, and efforts to identify these artefacts may provide information on the function and use of this structure. Unknown Structure 2 is situated north of the first structure. It is constructed of roughly made though well mortared together cement bricks and measures and is in height. A cement \\"capping\\" has been fitted over the structure, with later bricks added above. The southern elevation features a small cement brick return. The function of this structure remains unknown, though the Unknown Structure 2 may be a capped ventilation shaft installed for one of the two tunnels dug during operations of the Francis Mine on this site between 1908 and 1923. The \\"Mihi Ovens\\" and adjacent Klondyke Coke Ovens were fenced and partially cleared of pest vegetation by DERM under the supervision of DERM heritage officers between February and April 2010. Stumps and root structures of all large trees and plants remains to help maintain the structural integrity of the surrounding soils and the ovens themselves. The alignment of the fence follows the topography of the area and encompasses the predicted extent of the oven battery, the two unidentified brick structures located above the oven batteries, a section of low retaining wall on the lower terrace area to the south of the ovens, and a number of other elements thought to relate to the coke manufacturing operations. The \\"Mihi Ovens\\" fence is an extension of the existing fencing for the Klondyke Coke Ovens erected by DERM in 2009. It runs adjacent to Parker Lane in the north, then downhill in a southerly direction before running in a southeast direction to rejoin the Klondyke Coke Ovens fence. A short section of rail line of unknown date or origin and passing through a small cutting is extant in the vicinity of the coke manufacturing site on Lot 5 on AP3320. This line may represent the spur line constructed sometime between 1884 and 1890/1 while the coke manufacturing operations were owned by John Wright, but would have served the nearby coke ovens (built in the 1940s) and possibly the original battery of 12 ovens located immediately west. A small bridge, probably originally used as a trolley/tram bridge for the coke or mining operations, was located in the northern section of Lot 5 on AP3320 and is now used as a pedestrian bridge across creek to Clem Street. Brick debris, coal and coke is strewn across Lot 5 on AP3320 as are metal remnants of machinery including skips, crushing machinery, trammel screens, conveyor buckets and trolley parts.  Heritage listing  Railway line plaque, 2015 Mihi Creek site was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 16 July 2010 having satisfied the following criteria. The Mihi Creek site provides physical evidence and has potential for additional evidence relating to the early development of the Ipswich area, with archaeological artefacts associated with Queensland's first main line railway, early coal mining and coke manufacture. Archaeological artefacts associated with the early railway are rare surviving remnants of Queensland's first section of main line railway and provide tangible evidence of the priority placed on the development of the Ipswich region in the formative years of the Queensland colony. The very need for the railway reflects a government desire for faster, reliable and more economic transport to and from the region to promote commerce, industry, growth and settlement. The remnants of coal mining and coke manufacture are important in demonstrating important industries in the region's and Queensland's history. Coke manufacture played an important though under-recognised role in early coal mining and related industries over an extended period of time (1870s - ). The Mihi Creek site includes archaeological artefacts which illustrate early examples of processes and activities relating to the increasing demand for quality coke for use in early Queensland industry in the late 19th century (particularly for rail and maritime industries and coal-powered engines generally). Archaeological investigations within the Mihi Creek site have potential to answer a range of research questions about late 19th Century railway construction and design, and Queensland's late 19th and early 20th Century coke manufacturing industry. The area immediately adjacent the former rail line embankments have high potential to contain further structures and archaeological evidence associated with Queensland's first section of main line. This area has potential to provide further information about the construction of rail formations and embankments at the inception of the State's railway development. Comparative analyses of elements of the line within the Mihi Creek site with other known previously recorded features (e.g. Sandstone Railway Culvert, North Ipswich, Sandstone Railway Culvert, Wulkuraka, and North Ipswich Railway Workshops) have potential to shed new light on this important development in Queensland's history. The paucity of primary documentary material relating to coke manufacture in Queensland makes archaeological evidence the primary source relating to coke manufacture. Subsurface remains would feature high integrity due to lack of disturbance since the cessation of coke manufacture in . Archaeological investigations within the Mihi Creek site could produce evidence which would confirm or challenge contemporary understandings of the coke industry in Queensland, particularly about coke manufacturing processes, coking infrastructure, coke plant layout, organisation and evolution through time. While the colliery and coking operations at Mihi Creek were one of a number of the type within the West Moreton Coalfield, they were also one of the longest running (1870s - ) and underwent significant change over time, including owners and potentially equipment and production techniques. Archaeological investigations have potential to reveal important information about specific operations at Mihi Creek, particularly the full extent of coal mining and coke manufacture, the types of equipment used (other than beehive oven type and probable number in the original battery), and the precise location of key features. Coke manufacture at Mihi Creek went through several phases and intra-site analyses into changing work practices and inter-site comparisons with other coke manufacture sites would provide insights into the degree of change and/or continuity in coke manufacture practices on the West Moreton Coalfield and potentially across the State.

On 10 January 2013, the Sudan Federal Ministry of Health and the World Heath Organization (WHO) reported that there had been 847 suspected cases since 2 September 2012, including 171 deaths, for an estimated case fatality rate of 20%. A mass vaccination campaign was launched in mid-November. By early January, the five states of Darfur were free of any new cases. Epidemiology The first cases of yellow fever occurred in early September, but the first blood samples for confirmation were not sent to the Institut Pasteur reference laboratory in Dakar, Senegal until 30 October. On 9 November, WHO Sudan reported 266 suspected cases and 85 deaths for a case fatality rate of 32%. Most cases were in Central Dafur state (51.5 percent, reported in March 2013), but the outbreak later expanded to the four other states of North Darfur (21 percent), West Darfur (17.4 percent) and South Darfur (9.5 percent), including refugee camps related to the ongoing war in Darfur. Laboratory confirmation of yellow fever came on 13 November. Most of the cases were among nomads, which contributed to the rapid spread. Location of yellow fever cases in Darfur as of 9 January 2013. According to newspaper reports, about 10 000 workers from the gold mines of Jebel Amer fled to Nyala, the capital of South Darfur, after more than 60 deaths in the gold mining area. One newspaper reported: \\"The spread of the disease in South Darfur is a disaster and the epidemic requires organizations and the international community to address the disease and provide enough vaccines to vaccinate all citizens of the state.\\" Hundreds of patients had accumulated at the Nyala Teaching Hospital, some sleeping outside, and there was a shortage of medical personnel and supplies. By early December the number of deaths had reached 164. Health authorities in China began scanning travelers and Chinese citizens returning from Sudan. As many as a million Chinese workers are employed in oil, mining and construction in Africa. Introduction of yellow fever into Asia, where it has never appeared, is a serious concern. Vaccination Campaign On 13 November, the government of Sudan requested help from the International Coordinating Group on Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision (YF-ICG) in starting a mass vaccination campaign. Besides the WHO, the YF-ICG consists of representatives of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), M√©decins sans Fronti√®res (MSF) and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). The United Nations‚ÄìAfrican Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) airlifted the first batches of vaccines from Khartoum to Darfur on 18 November. Mass vaccination began on 20 November. Efforts were also undertaken to eliminate mosquitoes. A team from the Naval Medical Research Unit Three (NAMRU-3) and the WHO Collaborating Center was deployed from Cairo to help collect and test samples and train local personnel. The vaccination campaign, from late November 2012 through early January 2013, covered more than 3 million people and halted the outbreak. A new phase of the campaign beginning in January covered more than 2 million more people at risk. One of the difficulties was maintaining a cold chain for vaccine viability while transporting vaccine by donkey into remote areas. A situation report released on 10 January 2013 reported that 171 people had died of the disease as of 9 January 2013. The number of suspected cases since 2 September 2012 was 847. The Minister of Health had announced on 5 January that no additional cases had appeared in the previous 3 weeks.

He graduated from the Royal and Pontifical University of San Carlos Borromeo, and in 1781 became a faculty member of both the University and San Juan de Dios Hospital.  Biography  Flores arrived at a very young age to Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala and studied in the Jesuit school; then we attended the Royal and Pontifical University of San Carlos Borromeo where he graduated with a B.S. in Medicine in 1773. Using an inoculation method when there was a measles outbreak in Guatemala in 1780. The epidemic was contained and Dr. Flores obtained great success with the introduction of the vaccine in the kingdom. In 1785 he gave the hospital medical equipment and he considered as the founding father of Medicine education in both Guatemala and in Central America. He was a brilliant faculty member in the college of Medicine and, in order to make Anatomy and Physiology studies easier, designed and built life size statues that clearly showed the organs of the human body; the organs could be removed and placed back according to the students needs. The mannequins also helped in the teaching of Osteology, Myology and other related medical sciences. Finally, he also helped in Optics, with lenses that he invented. In 1797, with a scholarship from the government, Flores went on a four-year journey where he visited several American and European medical facilities. In Philadelphia he learned about Luigi Galvani's electrical experiments with frogs and later on he made studies on this of his own. When he arrived in Italia, he not only met Galvani, but Felice Fontana as well, whom he admired as scientist and maker of anatomic wax models. In Madrid, in 1803, he get in contact with Antoni de Gimbernat and made a report before the Surgeons Board about the need of a vaccination campaign in Spanish America, supported by the government.  Awards  * In recognition of his multiple merits, he was appointed as the first legal doctor in Guatemala, leading the Medical Board Court. * Due to his massive medical skills, the King of Spain appointed him as his personal physician. * Starting in 1900, the College of Medicine of the National UniversityName of the University of San Carlos of Guatemala between 1875 and 1918, and then between 1920 y 1944. granted the \\"Jos√© Felipe Flores\\" award to the best doctoral thesis each year at the Fiestas Minervalias.  Works  Flores wrote several medical documents, among them one called Espec√≠fico nuevamente descubierto en Guatemala para la cura del C√°ncer y otras enfermedades m√°s frecuentes (Newly discovered specific in Guatemala to cure Cancer and other more frequent illnesses). The cure consisted on eating small meatballs from a small lizard common to certain regions in Central America. The document was translated into French and German, and was discussed in medical forums. The lizard was included as curative in the medical lexicon.  Death  Flores died in Madrid, Spain, in 1824.

It was built between 1864 and 1865. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 November 2008.  History  The Sandstone Railway Culvert () at North Ipswich is located near the north eastern corner of the North Ipswich Railway Workshops. It is one of the few surviving original components of Queensland's first section of main line railway constructed between 1864 and 1865. Queensland's colonial government fostered the development of railways as a means of developing the State and providing social benefits. It was argued that rail would reduce freight costs and save travel time for passengers. An added incentive for rail development in Queensland was the very poor state of the roads. In wet weather especially, this hampered the transport of freight. The Ipswich reach of the Bremer River was chosen as the eastern terminus of the first main line railway instead of Brisbane because of the importance of Ipswich to the Darling Downs pastoralists. The town was located at the intersection of routes to the Darling Downs and Upper Brisbane Valley. It was the head of navigation of the Brisbane and Bremer Rivers and the town reach of the river was a major inland port for the pastoralists. Ipswich residents together with many pastoralists had campaigned for the town to become Queensland's capital. Eventually, Brisbane assumed that role but Ipswich remained an important regional centre. The Chief Engineer responsible for construction of the railway was Abraham Fitzgibbon, later to be engaged as Queensland's first Commissioner for Railways. Charles Fox and Son, an engineering firm based in England, were appointed as consulting engineers and Peto, Brassey and Betts, contractors with worldwide railway construction experience, were engaged to construct the line. Several months prior to its completion, operating staff also began to be recruited. Construction of the first section of main line between Ipswich and Bigge's Camp (now Grandchester) officially commenced on 25 February 1864 with the turning of the first sod at North Ipswich by Lady Diamantina Bowen. The first part of the route for this section commenced in the vicinity of the present Ipswich railway station, it crossed the Bremer River at the town reach and followed the north bank from the North Ipswich Railway Workshops, across Mihi Creek and Iron Pot Creek, joining the route of the present main line at Wulkuraka. The line to Bigge's Camp was officially opened on 31 July 1865. The culverts built for the Southern and Western railway lines were built to standard designs approved by Fitzgibbon in 1863. They were of masonry or timber construction; concrete was not used for culverts in Queensland until the 1880s. The North Ipswich culvert was built to the standard design for wide brick culverts. This design comprised a floor and sides of cut sandstone with an arched roof made from a double layer of bricks. Another culvert at Wulkuraka is built to the design for wide brick culverts. There are no known examples of intact timber culverts on this section of line. In 1875, the first part of the route, six kilometres of line between North Ipswich and Wulkuraka including the North Ipswich culvert, was bypassed by a shorter line to the south of the Bremer River via Sadlier's Crossing. This was built as part of the main railway line connection to Brisbane, approved in 1872. The rail link to Brisbane rendered the river trade along the Bremer and Brisbane Rivers redundant and spelt the end of the river port at Ipswich. A portion of the old line between North Ipswich and Wulkuraka was retained to serve the Railway Workshops and a small coal mine. The North Ipswich culvert is one of only three known culverts that belonged to the first section of main line. The other culverts (Sandstone Railway Culvert, Wulkuraka) are located near Wulkuraka. They are the earliest known railway culverts in Queensland.  Description  Interior showing sandstone wall and brick ceiling, 2004 The Sandstone Railway Culvert is located in a deep gully about west of the intersection of WM Hughes Street and Musgrave Street at North Ipswich. It is contained within a large undeveloped parcel of urban land that slopes down to the edge of the Bremer River. The culvert comprises a long tunnel, about wide, beneath an unsealed roadway. It is lined on the floor and to about a third of its height along the sides with rusticated sandstone blocks. The blocks lining the floor are long and considerably narrower than those lining the side. There are two courses of blocks on each side of the culvert. The arched roof of the culvert is lined with bricks. Top of the portal showing dressed stone, 2004 The portals of the culvert are fashioned from dressed sandstone, cut to form an arch; the brick roof of the culvert is not visible externally. At the eastern end of the culvert, the arched sandstone portal intersects with a wing wall made from rusticated sandstone blocks. Both portals are obscured by vegetation at the foot of the gully.  Heritage listing  Sandstone Railway Culvert was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 November 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. As an original component of Queensland's first section of main line railway, the Sandstone Railway Culvert () at North Ipswich is important in demonstrating the evolution of Queensland's history. This section of main line, running between the Bremer River at Ipswich and Bigge's Camp (now Grandchester), marked the beginning of Queensland's rail network and was an important step in the economic and social development of the State. As an element of the now bypassed section of main line between the original terminus at the Bremer River and Wulkuraka, the culvert provides tangible evidence of the economic and geographic priorities of the colonial government in the 1860s. The government decided to terminate the first main line at the Ipswich reach of the Bremer River because it functioned as an inland port for the pastoralists of West Moreton and the Darling Downs. This decision reflected the influence of the pastoralists in these regions and their requirements for faster, more economic transport to port. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The North Ipswich culvert is rare as one of the few surviving original components of Queensland's first section of main line railway. The railway culverts at North Ipswich and Wulkuraka (Sandstone Railway Culvert, Wulkuraka) are the only original culverts belonging to the first section of main line that are known to remain intact; they are the earliest railway culverts known to be extant in the State. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The culvert is a highly intact example of the standard design for brick culverts on the Southern and Western Railway. The culvert follows the design approved by the Engineer in Chief for construction of the line, Abraham Fitzgibbon, in 1863 and comprises floors and sides of sandstone with an arched roof of bricks.

It was designed and built by John Farrelly . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  This two-storey brick house is part of a row of four substantial brick houses on Limestone Street, starting from the corner of Waghorn Street, that were built around 1880 by Ipswich builder and architect John Farrelly. Farrelly originally bought Allotments 8, 9, 10 & 11 of Section 28 in 1878 and apparently built the houses from recycled materials salvaged from a fire which had destroyed St Mary's convent. John Farrelly was listed as living at Waghorn Street (corner of Limestone Street) in Postal Directories until his death in 1904 and owned all four properties until that time, suggesting that Farrelly occupied the first of the four brick homes from the corner while leasing the other three houses to tenants. The house at 109 Limestone Street, along with the other three, are an example of the work of an early property developer who contributed to the middle-class suburban development of Ipswich. John Farrelly was born in Bawnboy, County Cavan, Ireland where he worked as a builder before he emigrated to Queensland in 1861 and settled in Ipswich. He continued to worked as a builder in Ipswich and was listed as an architect from 1878 to 1901, although he had received no formal training in the field. Farrelly was active in local politics and was an unsuccessful Parliamentary candidate for Rosewood in 1888. He was a supporter of the Catholic Church and the eight-hour day. Some of his architectural work in Ipswich included buildings for the Queensland Pastoral and Agricultural Society (1885) and St Patrick's Hall in Darling Street Ipswich (1879) among many other cottages and residences in Ipswich built from the 1870s through to 1900. James Barnett Colthup, Ipswich, 1931 In 1909 the house was sold to James Barnett Colthup who purchased Subdivision 1 of Allotment 11 of Section 28. James Colthup was a local ironmonger and later a trader in household furnishings and was listed as having commercial premises in Nicholas Street. The house carried the name Colthup's House'. Colthup's Chambers are still extant in Brisbane Street as well as Colthup Home in Thorn Street, a modern nursing home which has obscured the presence of an original 19th century residence owned by the Colthup family from 1918 to 1958. In 1918 James Colthup sold the house at 109 Limestone Street and the property continued to change hands many times during the 20th Century. The house was converted to flats most probably in the 1930s when the verandahs were enclosed and the staircase removed. The back verandah remains enclosed displaying coloured glass windows in the exterior wall. The house at 109 Limestone Street remains as the most intact example of the four houses constructed by John Farrelly. The original design is easily visible and all interior joinery is still intact. The house also clearly displays evidence that the building materials were recycled. The house still demonstrates the original characteristics of its initial purpose as a late 19th century middle class residence.  Description  View from footpath, 2015 The house is set close to Limestone street presenting a single storey to the street with the land falling away to the rear of the property, with two storeys at the rear. It is of load bearing brick rendered with ruled joints. The roofline is a steeply pitched hip and is broken at the verandah line to form a curved profile. The house was constructed from recycled materials from St Mary's Convent and this can be seen in the size of the structural timbers and the distinctive windows. The upper level consists of a central hallway containing a stair to the lower level, with three bedrooms opening from the left of the hall and two formal rooms opening from the right. The hallway is a generous size and both front and rear doors are original and feature sidelights with Gothic arches and coloured glass. The formal living rooms contain back to back fireplaces and open to the verandah via French doors. The verandah surrounds four sides of the upper level and is enclosed at one side to form a storeroom. The house has been extended at the rear to form a family room, kitchen and bathroom. The core rooms on the upper level have vaulted ceilings of tongue and groove boarding and double-hung windows with distinctive top sashes with curved tops. The hallway ceiling has been lined with plasterboard. The original window and door joinery is intact. The verandah was enclosed earlier and no elements of the original detailing remain. The lower level consists of a hallway, two bedrooms and a new bathroom. One of the bedrooms was the original kitchen and contains a large fireplace. The area under the front verandah can be accessed from the lower level hall and is enclosed with rough stonework with a concrete floor and a small timber window. This space is said to be the original bathroom and contains a concrete tub, which was apparently a feature of all John Farrelly's houses.  Heritage listing  Colthup's House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The house is important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history in that it reflects the suburban development of Ipswich in the latter 19th century. As one of four houses constructed around 1880 by the builder John Farrelly it is an example of multiple property development in a time of growth and expansion for Ipswich. It also exemplifies a trend in usage of recycled building materials as common practice during the period of construction. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The house is an intact example of an 1880s middle class dwelling with original design features and fittings still evident in the fabric. It stands as the most intact example of a group for four adjacent dwellings constructed around 1880. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The house contributes significantly to the streetscape of upper Limestone Street approaching the hill towards Burnett Street and the surrounding area which is characterised by many examples of 19th century houses. Most notable is the coherent streetscape presented by the four adjacent masonry dwellings (being 109, 107, 105 & 103 Limestone Street) all of similar design and construction. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The house has special association with life and work of local architect and builder and prominent member of the Ipswich community John Farrelly. Farrelly was registered as an architect in Ipswich from 1878 to 1901.

It was built from 1861 to 1919. It is also known as Ipswich West Special School. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Ipswich West State School and Ipswich West Special School stand on a site which has been used as a primary school since 1861. Following the first Education Act of 1860 a government based education system was commenced in Queensland and schools began to appear across the state. In 1861, seven National Schools were opened in Queensland which included the coeducational school at Little Ipswich on 5 August. Little Ipswich (now West Ipswich) was an area of early urban settlement in Ipswich and in 1862 there were 52 pupils enrolled at the school. The Boys school Later agitation by the Ipswich National School Committee forced the establishment of a separate Boys' and Girls' Schools and a new Boys' School Building was erected in 1882 on the site of the present Special School. Contractors Reuben Worley and James Whitehead erected the building at a cost of , of which was provided by the local community in accordance with government legislation of the time. The Education Act of 1875 introduced free, compulsory education for children aged 6 to 12 years which prompted an increase in school attendance and a need for additional educational facilities. Local communities were required to provide one fifth of the cost of construction and the Department of Public Instruction provided a teacher and resources. The school was erected to one of the standard designs of Robert Ferguson, Superintendent of School Buildings for the Department of Public Instruction from 1875 to 1893. This standard design was known as \\"Carpenter Gothic\\", a style used in metropolitan areas and provincial cities from 1880 to 1893. The design addressed problems in earlier school buildings by providing wider verandahs, ample floor space, play sheds, well protected hat rooms, convenient lavatories and decent offices. The design of these school buildings also reflected a change in attitude to the education of children as it responded to the concerns of educationalists including improved light and ventilation for students. The former Boys' School building displays many of the original design features such as steeply pitched roofs, decorative finials and brackets at the end gables and diagonal boarding on the verandah ceilings. The grounds also contained a play shed, common in the Ferguson era, still standing today. After the erection the Boys' School the girls continued to occupy the original 1861 school building. During the floods of 1893 the Girls' School was used for accommodating people who had lost their homes. Building of a new Girls' School began in 1907 and this involved construction of a brick wing by Harry Woodford at a cost of . In 1911 an additional brick wing was added by Wilson and Pickels contractors at a cost of . Work on the final section was commenced in 1919 at a cost and was officially opened on 19 June 1920. The gradual construction of the three brick school buildings from 1907 to 1919 reflected a change in the design and construction method of state schools due to the increased prosperity in Queensland in the early 1900s. Brick schools were all individually designed and were built in areas where a large population justified their construction. Brick schools were not commonplace which makes the Ipswich West State School buildings a good example of the type of school buildings erected in an established urban area during the period. In 1934 the Boys' and Girls' Schools again became coeducational, occupying only the brick buildings, with C.W. Munro as the Headmaster. At this time pupils numbered 232 and remodelling of the school was undertaken at a cost of . For twenty years the old Boys' School stood unoccupied and fell into disrepair. Demolition was resisted by the School Committee who carried out some maintenance and used it as a venue for fund raising functions. In 1957 vocational training for primary pupils of the Ipswich district was introduced and the old school became a manual training centre. The school is the now the premises for the Ipswich West Special School. Recent additions to both school complexes include a new painted blockwork and timber covered way and classroom block designed by Bruce Buchanan Architects Pty Ltd and built in 1991 at a cost of $400,000 at the Ipswich West State School, and a new block designed by David Pagenden Architects for the Special School, also built in 1991.  Description  Belfry, 2016 The listing boundary encompasses two separate state schools on a single site - Ipswich West State School and Ipswich West Special School, both of which contain early school buildings. Ipswich West Special School, at the northern end of the site, contains two early timber school buildings, constructed in 1882. These buildings are typical of the schools constructed during the Ferguson Era (1875-1893) of the Department of Public Instruction and are similar to the B/T4 Type, usually designed for medium to larger schools. The two wings are set at right angles to each other and are low set, timber framed buildings clad in chamferboards and supported on brick piers. They have steeply pitched gable roofs with stepped bargeboards to the original verandah spaces. Decorative timber brackets are set in front of timber louvred vents at each gable end. Each wing originally contained two separate classrooms with verandahs front and back. At each end wall a large bank of windows is protected by a timber window hood. The classrooms in the eastern wing feature tall, narrow timber windows which pivot from a central fitting. The original verandah ceilings are lined with diagonal boarding on top of the rafters. Classroom walls and ceilings are lined internally with horizontal boarding. The northern wing has a separate teachers room set at 90 degrees to the main building and accessed from the front verandah. The northern wing retains one classroom with internal boarded finish, the other classroom has been divided with plasterboard partitions into office spaces. The eastern wing contains two classrooms linked by a concertina door. The rear walls to the verandahs have been removed and the verandah space incorporated into the classrooms. A new classroom block and covered walkway has been added at right angles to the eastern wing. An early timber play shed is located in the Ipswich West Special School grounds. It is a gable roofed open structure of the B/T5 Type. Surviving early fabric includes large-scale timber posts with curved timber brackets. The posts have been cut off at the base and supported on steel stirrups. The play shed has been re-roofed and the end wall enclosed with steel custom-orb sheeting with weatherboards to each gable end. Ipswich West State School contains three brick school buildings which were constructed between 1907 and 1919. Brick schools were not as common as timber schools and these buildings do not conform to a particular typology. Brick schools were usually individually designed and were built in areas which had a larger population. The buildings are set in a U-shape configuration, and are of face brick construction with steeply pitched gable roofs. Decorative timber fretwork is a feature of each gable end, and the south and west wings have louvred vents behind the fretwork. The 1907 wing is separated from the adjoining western wing, the western wing abuts the south wing at one corner and all buildings are connected by a timber verandah. A separate room was constructed for the principal's office at 90 degrees to the west wing, accessed from the verandah. The verandah is simply detailed with slatted timber balustrades, lattice panels and curved timber valances. The 1907 north wing is a low-set building with equally spaced double- hung windows to three sides. Separate window hoods protect the end windows and the roof is extended down and supported with timber brackets to protect the windows to the northern side. The eastern end of the verandah has been enclosed with weatherboards to form a storeroom. The interior ceilings are lined with tongue and groove boarding and feature a central lattice vent. The original single room has been divided into two offices with a recent glazed partition. Adjacent to the verandah is an early school bell. The bell hangs under a small pyramid roof set on four timber posts on a stone base. The south wing appears to be the earlier 1911 building because the west wing has been joined to it at the corner and the end window of the south wing has been bricked in. The south wing is high set at the eastern end with toilets under the building. The toilet space is divided by single-skin vertically boarded partitions. The fixtures are recent. The upper floor of the building originally contained three separate classrooms which have now been converted to two classrooms with a multi-purpose space between them. The south wall has equally spaced double- hung windows protected by a roof overhang supported by timber brackets. A timber framed addition with a hip roof is at the eastern end of the building, which is used for offices. The west wing, probably built in 1919, is high set with play space and a tuckshop under the building. The upper floor originally contained three separate classrooms but has been modified to house the staff room in one original classroom space, with the library occupying two classrooms with the dividing wall removed. Large bays of casement windows to each end wall remain, with the top bay of windows set inwards at an angle. Window hoods with timber brackets and lattice panels protect these windows. Access to the classrooms is provided by double timber doors with fanlights above. A separate brick office, originally for the principal, is accessed from the verandah of this wing. It is a gable roofed extension set at 90 degrees to the building with a single double-hung window. Sports oval, 2016 A brick toilet block stands to the east of the buildings. It is constructed of face brick with a hip roof and high-level louvred windows. Recent school buildings have been set well back from the early buildings and do not intrude on the setting.  Heritage listing  The school was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The school is important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history as the layers of school buildings constructed since 1861 reflect the growth of Queensland's education system. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. They are also prime examples of two different architectural types of Queensland State School buildings which changed in response to practical needs, changing attitudes to education and social trends in local communities and the state as a whole. The 1882 buildings (in the Special School Complex) were built to the standard Ferguson design, \\"Carpenter Gothic\\", developed in response to requests by educationalists to improve standards of school buildings in Queensland. The brick buildings (in the Ipswich West State School Complex, 1907 - 1919) were constructed in a period which saw variance in design dictated by the size and wealth of the local community. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The two school complexes are of aesthetic significance, the brick buildings creating a visually consistent composition unobstructed by recent buildings and framed by mature trees in the school grounds. Both the brick and the earlier timber buildings are significant for their architectural composition and detailing e.g. the steeply pitched gabled roofs, timber brackets and finials, diagonal boarding and variety of window types. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The schools have a strong association with the past, present and future generations of the school communities as a place of continuous education and recreation and as a focal point for the local community since 1861.

Formation  Lesbian Feminist Liberation was originally the Lesbian Liberation Committee and a part of the Gay Activists Alliance (GAA). In 1972, when the members felt the GAA was not giving enough focus to lesbian and feminist issues, they left GAA and formed the Lesbian Feminist Liberation. The departure was coordinated by Jean O'Leary. The formation of Lesbian Feminist Liberation left the Radicalesbians (RL) group with few members. The Lesbian Liberation Committee, and initially the Lesbian Feminist Liberation as well, met at an old firehouse at 99 Wooster Street in SoHo, the location was known as \\"The Firehouse.\\"  Activities  In 1973, Lesbian Feminist Liberation participated in the campaign to lobby the New York City Council to add sexual orientation to the city's anti-discrimination city ordinance. Twenty-five members of the organization attended The Dick Cavett Show and disrupted his interview with George Gilder, an author the organization believed was anti-feminist and anti-lesbian. The organization also organized a demonstration with 200 participants, and a large fake lavender colored dinosaur outside the National Museum of American History to protest sexism at the museum. They picketed at a Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts movie theater that was showing Rainer Werner Fassbinder's The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant, which some feminists found offensive for its depiction of lesbian sadomasochism. Lesbian Feminist Liberation's Jean O'Leary speaks at 1973 LGBT Pride March in New York City. The organization opposed the performance by drag queens at the 1973 LGBT Pride March in New York City. As they passed out flyers, Sylvia Rivera, of Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries, took the microphone from emcee Vito Russo and spoke against the sentiment and spoke of the harassment and arrests of drag queens on the street, some of whom had been involved with the Stonewall riots. Lesbian Feminist Liberation's Jean O'Leary then insisted on responding by denouncing drag as misogynist and criticizing the march for being too male-dominated. This prompted Lee Brewster of Queens Liberation Front to denounce anti- transgender lesbian feminists. The increasingly angry crowd only calmed when Bette Midler, who heard on the radio in her Greenwich Village apartment, arrived, took the microphone, and began singing \\"Friends\\". This was one of many events in early 1970s where lesbian and transgender activists clashed. When NBC aired \\"Flowers of Evil\\", an episode of Police Woman about a trio of lesbians murdering nursing home residents for their money, the organization staged a zap at NBC's New York City headquarters on November 19, 1973. Ten women entered the building in pairs at 15-minute intervals, traveling by elevator to different floors before converging on the Standards and Practices offices. Advised that vice president Herminio Traviesas would not return to the office until the following week, demonstrators announced their intention to wait until he returned and occupied his office overnight. Around 75 women demonstrated in front of the building. The following morning half of the women left, along with the children of the lead protester. The remaining protesters unfurled a twenty foot long banner from the balcony of vice president Herminio Traviesas's office reading \\"LESBIANS PROTEST NBC\\". They and street-level picketers chanted slogans like \\"NBC works against lesbians\\" and \\"Lesbians are sitting in\\". The demonstrators hoped to attract both network news coverage and arrests. When they realized neither was forthcoming, they left the building. While the networks ignored the story, it was picked up by local media and the wire services. Ultimately, NBC agreed not to rerun the episode. In 1974, the organization worked with New York Radical Feminists to increase the visibility of women at the New York City LGBT Pride March.

It was ruled in turn by three monarchs; Henry IV, Louis XIII, and Louis XIV, and saw the building of some of the city's most famous parks and monuments, including the Pont Neuf, the Palais Royal, the newly joined Louvre and Tuileries Palace, the Place des Vosges, and the Luxembourg Garden. It was also a flourishing center of French science and the arts; it saw the founding of the Paris Observatory, the French Academy of Sciences and the first botanical garden in Paris, which also became the first park in Paris open to the public. The first permanent theater opened, the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise was founded, and the first French opera and French ballets had their premieres. Paris became the home of the new Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture, and of some of France's most famous writers, including Pierre Corneille, Jean Racine, La Fontaine and Moliere. Urban innovations for the city included the first street lighting, the first public transport, the first building code, and the first new aqueduct since Roman times. Paris under Henry IV At the end of the 16th century, Paris was the last fortress of the besieged Catholic League, defended by the soldiers of the King of Spain and the fervently Catholic population. The royalist army of Henry IV had defeated the Catholic League on the battlefield, and Henry's soldiers were bombarding Paris from the heights of Montmartre and Montfaucon, but, lacking heavy artillery he could not break through the massive walls of the city. He decided instead upon a dramatic gesture to win over the Parisians; on July 25, 1593, at the Abbey of Saint-Denis, Henry IV formally renounced his Protestant faith. In the following weeks, the support for the Catholic League melted away. The Governor of Paris and the Provost of the merchants secretly joined Henry's side, and on March 2 the leader of the League, Charles de Mayenne, fled the city, followed by his Spanish soldiers. On March 22, 1594, Henry IV triumphantly entered the city, ending a war that had lasted for thirty years. Once established in Paris, Henry worked to reconcile himself with the leaders of the Catholic Church. He decreed toleration of the Protestants with the Edict of Nantes, and imposed an end to the war with Spain and Savoy. To govern the city, he named Francois Miron, a loyal and energetic administrator, as the new lieutenant of the Chatelet (effectively the chief of police) from 1604 until 1606, and then as Provost of the Merchants, the highest administrative post, from 1606 until 1612. He named Jacques Sanguin, another effective administrator, to be Provost of the Merchants from 1606 to 1612. Paris had suffered greatly during the wars of religion; a third of the Parisians had fled; the population was estimated to be 300,000 in 1600. Many houses were destroyed, and the grand projects of the Louvre, the H√¥tel de Ville, and the Tuileries Palace were unfinished. Henry began a series of major new projects to improve the functioning and appearance of the city, and to win over the Parisians to his side. The Paris building projects of Henry IV were managed by his forceful superintendent of buildings, a Protestant and a general, Maximilien de B√©thune, Duke of Sully. The Pont Neuf, Place Dauphine and the old Palace in 1615 Henry IV recommenced the construction of the Pont Neuf, which had been begun by Henry III in 1578, but had stopped during the wars of religion. It was finished between 1600 and 1607, and was the first Paris bridge without houses and with sidewalks. Near the bridge, he built La Samaritaine (1602‚Äì1608), a large pumping station which provided drinking water, as well as water for the gardens of the Louvre and the Tuileries Gardens. Henry and his builders also decided to add an innovation to the Paris cityscape; three new residential squares, modeled after those in Italian Renaissance cities. On the vacant site of the old royal residence of Henri II, the H√¥tel des Tournelles, he built an elegant new residential square surrounded by brick houses and an arcade. It was built between 1605 and 1612, and was named Place Royale, renamed Place des Vosges in 1800. In 1607, he began work on a new residential triangle, Place Dauphine, lined by thirty-two brick and stone houses, near the end of the √éle de la Cit√©. A third square, Place de France, was planned for a site near the old Temple, but was never built. The assassination of Henry iV by a Catholic fanatic while his carriage was blocked on rue de la Ferronnerie Place Dauphine was Henry's last project for the city of Paris. The more fervent factions of the Catholic hierarchy in Rome and in France had never accepted Henry's authority, and there were seventeen unsuccessful attempts to kill him. The eighteenth attempt, on May 14, 1610 by Fran√ßois Ravaillac, a Catholic fanatic, while the King's carriage was blocked in traffic on rue de la Ferronnerie, was successful. Four years later, a bronze equestrian statue of the murdered king was erected on the bridge he had constructed at the √éle de la Cit√© western point, looking toward Place Dauphine. Paris under Louis XIII Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu in 1628 Louis XIII was a few months short of his ninth birthday when his father was assassinated. His mother, Marie de' Medici, became Regent and ruled France in his name. She retained many of the ministers of Henry IV, but dismissed the most talented, Sully, because of his abrasive personality. She filled the royal council instead with nobles from her native Florence, including Concino Concini, the husband of one of her ladies in waiting, Leonora Dori, who served the superstitious Queen by performing exorcisms and white magic to undo curses and black magic. Concini became head of the royal council. Marie de' Medicis decided to build a residence for herself, the Luxembourg Palace, on the sparsely-populated left bank. It was constructed between 1615 and 1630, and modelled after the Pitti Palace in Florence. She commissioned the most famous painter of the period, Peter Paul Rubens, to decorate the interior with huge canvases of her life with Henry IV (now on display in the Louvre). She ordered the construction of a large Italian Renaissance garden around her palace, and commissioned a Florentine fountain-maker, Tommaso Francini, to create the Medici Fountain. Water was scarce in the Left Bank, one reason that part of the city had grown more slowly than the Right Bank. To provide water for her gardens and fountains, Marie de Medicis had the old Roman aqueduct from Rungis reconstructed. Thanks largely to her presence on the left bank, and the availability of water, noble families began to build houses on the left bank, in a neighborhood that became known as the Faubourg Saint-Germain. In 1616, she created another reminder of Florence on the right bank; the Cours la Reine, a long tree-shaded promenade along the Seine west of the Tuileries Gardens. The Luxembourg Palace and gardens. They were built by Marie de' Medici to recall her native Florence. Louis XIII entered his fourteenth year in 1614, and was officially an adult, but his mother and her favorite, Concini, refused to allow him to lead the Royal Council. On April 24, 1617, Louis had his captain of the guards assassinate Concini at the Louvre. Concini's wife was charged with sorcery, beheaded and then burned at that stake on the Place de Greve. Concini's followers were chased from Paris. Louis exiled his mother to the Ch√¢teau de Blois in the Loire Valley. Louis made his own favorite, Charles d'Albert, the Duke of Luynes, the new head of the council, and launched a new campaign to persecute the Protestants. The Duke of Luynes died during an unsuccessful military campaign against the Protestants in Montauban. Marie de' Medici managed to escape from her exile in the Ch√¢teau de Bois, and was reconciled with her son. Louis tried several different heads of government before finally selecting the Cardinal de Richelieu, a protege of his mother, in April 1624. Richelieu quickly showed his military skills and gift for political intrigue by defeating the Protestants at La Rochelle in 1628 and by executing or sending into exile several high-ranking nobles who challenged his authority. In 1630, Marie de' Medici quarreled again with Richelieu, and demanded that her son choose between Richelieu or her. For a day (called by historians the \\"Day of the dupes\\") it appeared that she had won, but the next day Louis XIII invited Richelieu to the ch√¢teau de Vincennes and gave him his full support. Marie de' Medici was exiled to Compiegne, then went to live in exile in Brussels, Amsterdam and Cologne, where she died in 1642. Richelieu turned his attention to completing and beginning new projects for the improvement of Paris. Between 1614 and 1635, four new bridges were built over the Seine; the Pont Marie, the Pont de la Tournelle, the Pont au Double, and the Pont Barbier. Two small islands in the Seine, the √éle Notre-Dame and the √éle-aux- vaches, which had been used for grazing cattle and storing firewood, were combined to make the √éle Saint-Louis, which became the site of the splendid h√¥tels particuliers of Parisian financiers. The Palais-Cardinal, the residence of Cardinal Richelieu, later the Palais Royal, in 1650 Louis XIII and Richelieu continued the rebuilding of the Louvre project begun by Henri IV. In the center of the old medieval fortress, where the great round tower had been, he created the harmonious Cour Carr√©e, or square courtyard, with its sculpted facades. In 1624, Richelieu began construction of a palatial new residence for himself in the center of the city, the Palais-Cardinal, which on his death was willed to the King and became the Palais-Royal. He began by buying a large mansion, the H√¥tel de Rambouillet, to which he added an enormous garden, three times larger than the present Palais-Royal garden, ornamented with a fountain in the center, flowerbeds and rows of ornamental trees, and surrounded by arcades and buildings. In 1629, once the construction of the new palace was underway, land was cleared and construction of a new residential neighborhood began nearby, the quartier Richelieu, near the Porte Saint-Honor√©. Other members of the Nobility of the Robe (mostly members of government councils and the courts) built their new residences in the Marais, close to the Place Royale. Map of Paris by Claes Jansz (1618) Richelieu helped introduce a new religious architectural style into Paris, inspired by the famous churches in Rome, particularly the church of the Jesuits, and the Basilica of Saint Peter. The first fa√ßade built in the Jesuit style was that of the church of Saint- Gervais (1616); the first church entirely built in the new style was Saint- Paul-Saint-Louis, on rue Saint-Antoine in the Marais between 1627-1647. The hearts of both Louis XIII and Louis XIV were interred there. Richelieu also built a new chapel for the Sorbonne, for which he had been the proviseur, or head of the college. It was constructed between 1635 and 1642. The dome was inspired by dome of Saint Peter's in Rome, which also inspired the domes at the churches of Val-de-Grace and Les Invalides. The plan was taken from another Roman church, San Carlo ai Catinari. When Richelieu died, the church became his final resting place. During the first part of the regime of Louis XIII Paris prospered and expanded, but the beginning of French involvement the Thirty Years' War against the Holy Roman Empire and the Habsburgs in 1635 brought heavy new taxes and hardships. The French Army was defeated by the Habsburg-ruled Spanish on August 15, 1636, and for several months a Spanish army threatened Paris. The King and Richelieu became increasingly unpopular with the Parisians. Richelieu died in 1642, and Louis XIII six months later in 1643. The playwright and poet Pierre Corneille described the feelings of Parisians toward the King and his government in a sonnet written shortly after the King's death; \\"In his name, ambition, pride, audacity and avarice made our laws: and while He was himself the most just of Kings, injustice ruled throughout his reign.\\" Paris under Louis XIV Turmoil and the Fronde Cardinal Mazarin in the gallery of his palace, by Robert Nanteuil (1659) Richelieu died in 1642, and Louis XIII in 1643. At the death of his father, Louis XIV was only five years old, and his mother, Anne of Austria, became Regent. Richelieu's successor, Cardinal Mazarin, decreed a series of heavy new taxes upon the Parisians to finance the ongoing war. A new law in 1644 required those who had built homes close to the city walls to pay heavy penalties; in 1646 new tax was imposed on the middle-class to finance a loan to the state of 500,000 pounds, and taxes were imposed on all fruits and vegetables brought into the city. In 1647, a new law required that those who had built homes on property officially belonging to the King would have to re- purchase the rights to the land. In 1648, Mazarin informed the noble members of three of the highest civil councils in the city, the Grand Council, the Chambre des comptes and the Cour des Aides that they would not be paid any salary for the next four years. These measures caused a rebellion within the Parlement of Paris, which was not an elected assembly but a high court made up of prominent noblemen. On May 13, 1648, the Parlement called a meeting in the Chambre Saint-Louis, the main hall of the Palace on the √Æle de la Cit√©, to \\"reform the abuses of the State\\". The Fort royal was constructed in the gardens of the Palais-Cardinal to teach the young Louis XIV about the art of fortifications Faced with the united opposition of the leaders of Paris, Mazarin backed down and accepted many of their proposals, and waited for an opportunity to strike back. The victory of the French army led by Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Cond√© over the Spanish at the Battle of Lens gave him the opportunity he needed. An arranged a special mass at the Cathedral of Notre Dame, with the presence of the young King, to celebrate the victory, and brought soldiers into the city to line the street for the procession before the ceremony. As soon as the ceremony at Notre-Dame concluded, Mazarin had three prominent members of the Parlement arrested. When news of the arrests spread around Paris, riots broke out in the streets, and more than twelve hundred barricades were erected on the √éle de la Cit√©, near the Place de Greve, les Halles, around the University, and in the Faubourg Saint-Germain. There were several violent confrontations in the streets between soldiers and the Parisians. The leaders of the Parlement were received at the Palais-Royal, where Anne of Austria and the young King were living, and she agreed, after some hesitation, to release the imprisoned member of the Parlement. This was the beginning of the Fronde, a long struggle between Mazarin and the Parlement of Paris and its supporters, and then between Mazarin and two princes of the royal family. The signing of the Peace of Westphalia on May 15, 1648, ending the Thirty Years' War, allowed Mazarin to bring his army, led by the Prince of Cond√©, back toward Paris. On the night of 5‚Äì6 January, Mazarin, the Regent and the young king were smuggled out of Paris to the Ch√¢teau de Saint-Germain-en- Laye. The Parlement declared Mazarin a public enemy and called upon the Parisians to take up arms. The arrival of the royal army under de Cond√© put down the first uprising, but the struggle between Mazarin and the Parlement continued. On the night of February 6‚Äì7, Mazarin, in disguise, left Paris for Le Havre. On February 16, Cond√©, the commander of the royal army, changed sides and demanded to be the leader of the Fronde. The Fronde quickly split into rival factions, while Mazarin did not have the funds to raise an army to defeat it. The standoff between Mazarin and the Fronde continued from 1648 until 1653. At times, the young Louis XIV was held under virtual house arrest in the Palais-Royal. He and his mother were forced to flee the city twice to the royal ch√¢teau at Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Cavaliers of the Fronde and the royal army battle outside the walls of Paris (1852) In 1652, Mazarin made the error of enlisting seven to eight thousand German mercenaries with his own money to fight against the French army. The Fronde rose again, this time led by two prominent nobles, the Prince de Cond√©, Gaston, Duke of Orl√©ans, the Governor of Paris and the younger brother of the King, against Mazarin. At the beginning of May, the royal army of Turenne defeated the Frondeurs under Cond√© at √âtampes, not far from Paris; they fought again at Saint Denis April 10 and 12. The Parlement refused to allow Cond√© and his soldiers into the city. On July 2, Cond√©'s soldiers fought the royal army just outside the city, beneath the walls of the Bastille, and were defeated. Cond√© managed to bring the remains of his army into Paris. He summoned the Parlement and leading merchants and clergy, and demanded to be recognized as the leader of the city. The leaders of the Parlement and the merchants of Paris, along with representatives of the clergy, assembled at the H√¥tel de Ville and rejected Cond√©'s proposal; they simply wanted the departure of Mazarin. The soldiers of Cond√©, furious, attacked the assembly, killing some of the members, further alienating the Parisians. On August 19 Mazarin withdrew to Bouillon in the Ardennes and continued his intrigues to win back Paris from there. Rising prices and the scarcity of food in Paris made the government of Frondeurs more and more unpopular. On September 10, Mazarin encouraged the Parisians to take up arms against Cond√©. On September 24, a large demonstration took place outside the Palais-Royal, demanding the return of the King. Gaston d'Orleans changed sides, turning against Cond√©. On September 28, the leaders of Paris sent a delegation to the King asking him to return to the city, and refused to pay or feed the soldiers of Cond√© camped in the city. Cond√© abandoned Paris on October 14 and took refuge in the Spanish Netherlands. On October 22 the young King, at the Louvre, issued a decree forbidding the Parlement of Paris to interfere in affairs of state and the royal finances. Mazarin, victorious, returned to Paris on February 3, 1653 and took charge once again of the government. \\"The new Rome\\" The Pont Neuf in the 1660s As a result of the Fronde, Louis XIV had a profound lifelong distrust of the Parisians. He moved his Paris residence from the Palais-Royal to the more secure Louvre: then, in 1671, he moved the royal residence out of the city to Versailles, and came into Paris as seldom as possible. While he disliked the Parisians, Louis XIV wanted to give Paris a monumental grandeur that would make it the successor to Ancient Rome. The king named Jean-Baptiste Colbert as his new Superintendent of Buildings, and Colbert began an ambitious building program. To make his intention clear Louis XIV organised a carrousel festival in the courtyard of the Tuileries in January 1661, in which he appeared, on horseback, in the costume of a Roman emperor, followed by the nobility of Paris. Louis completed the Cour Carr√©e of the Louvre and built a majestic row of columns along its east fa√ßade (1670). Inside the Louvre his architect Louis Le Vau and his decorator Charles Le Brun created the Gallery of Apollo, the ceiling of which featured an allegoric figure of the young king steering the chariot of the Sun across the sky. He enlarged the Tuileries Palace with a new north pavilion, built a magnificent new theater, the Th√©√¢tre des Tuileries, attached to the palace, and had Andr√© Le N√¥tre, the royal gardener, remodel the gardens of the Tuileries into a French formal garden. But another ambitious project, an exuberant design by Bernini for the eastern facade of the Louvre, was never built; it was replaced by a more severe and less expensive colonnade, whose construction proceeded very slowly due to a lack of funds. Louis turned his attention more and more to Versailles. On February 10, 1671, Louis departed Paris and made his permanent residence in Versailles. In the remaining forty- three years of his reign, he visited Paris just twenty-four times for official ceremonies, usually for no longer than twenty-four hours. While he built new monuments to his glory, the king also took measures to prevent any form of opposition to his will. On March 15, 1667, he named Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie to a new position, the Lieutenant General of Police, with the function of making the city work more efficiently, but also to suppress any opposition or criticism of the king. The number of policemen was quadrupled. Anyone who circulated a pamphlet or flyer critical of the king was subject to whipping, banishment and a sentence to the galleys. On 22 October the king revoked the Edict of Nantes and its promised religious tolerance for Protestants; on the same day demolition of the Protestant church at Charenton began. Repression of dissident sects resumed. Place des Victoires (about 1695) Dedication of the statue of Louis XIV on Place Louis-le-Grand, now Place Vend√¥me (1699) In his absence, his construction projects within Paris continued. Mazarin left funds in his will to build the Coll√®ge des Quatre-Nations (College of the Four Nations) (1662‚Äì1672), an ensemble of four baroque palaces and a domed church, to house sixty young noble students coming to Paris from four provinces recently attached to France (today it is the Institut de France). In the center of Paris, Colbert constructed two monumental new squares, Place des Victoires (1689) and Place Vend√¥me (1698). He built a new hospital for Paris, La Salp√™tri√®re, and, for wounded soldiers, a new hospital complex with two churches, Les Invalides (1674). Of the two hundred million livres that Louis spent on buildings, twenty million were spent in Paris; ten million for the Louvre and the Tuileries; 3.5 million for the new royal Gobelins Manufactory and the Savonnerie, 2 million for Place Vend√¥me, and about the same for the churches of Les Invalides. Louis XIV made his final visit to Paris in 1704 to see Les Invalides under construction. The city continued to expand. In 1672, Colbert issued new lettres patentes to enlarge the formal boundaries of the city to the site of the future wall built by Louis XVI in 1786, the Wall of the Farmers General. The nobility built its townhouses in the Faubourg Saint- Germain, which expanded as far as Les Invalides. Louis XIV declared that Paris was secure against any attack, and no longer needed its old walls. He demolished the main city walls, creating the space which eventually became the Grands Boulevards. To celebrate the destruction of the old walls, he built two small arches of triumph, Porte Saint-Denis (1672) and Porte Saint-Martin (1676). The last years of the century brought more unhappiness for the Parisians. In 1688, the king's grand design to dominate Europe was challenged by the new Protestant king of England, William of Orange, and by a new coalition of European countries. The war brought more taxation for the Parisians. In 1692-1693, the countryside was hit with poor harvests, causing widespread hunger in the city. In October 1693 the Lieutenant General of Police, La Reynie, built thirty ovens to bake bread for the poor of Paris. The bread was sold for two sous a loaf at the Louvre, the Place des Tuileries, the Bastille, the Luxembourg Palace, and on the rue d'Enfer. Crowds pushed and fought for a chance to buy bread. The terrible conditions were repeated in the winter of 1693-94. One diarist, Robert Challes, wrote that, at the height of the famine, between fourteen and fifteen hundred people of both sexes and all ages were dying daily of hunger and disease at the H√¥tel de Dieu hospital and on the streets outside. At the end of March 1694, Madame de S√©vign√© wrote to friends that she had to leave the city; \\"there is no longer any way to live in the middle of the air and misery we have here.\\" The city grows The Merian map of Paris (1615) Paris in 1610 was roughly round, about five hundred hectares in area, and was divided by the Seine. It was possible to walk at a brisk pace from the north end of the city to the south, a distance of about three kilometers, in about half an hour. There were two main north-south streets through the city; one from Porte Saint Martin to Porte Saint-Jacques, which crossed the Seine on the Pont Notre-Dame, and a second wide street from Porte Saint-Denis to the Porte Saint-Michel, crossing the Pont au Change and the Pont Saint-Michel. There was a single main east-west axis, beginning at the Bastille in the east and ending at Porte Saint-Honor√© in the west, via the rue Saint Antoine, rue des Balais, rue Roi-de-Sicilie, rue de la Verrerie, rue des Lombards, rue de la Ferronnerie, and finally rue Saint-Honor√©. Between the main streets in the center of the city was a maze of narrow, winding streets, between wooden houses four or five stories high, dark at night and crowded and noisy during the day. At night, many of the streets were closed with large chains, kept in drums at the corners. They were dimly lit by a small number of oil lamps. Porte Saint-Bernard, by Adam Perelle (c. 1680) The royal residence was usually either the Louvre or the Ch√¢teau of Vincennes, just east of the city. The courts and royal administrative offices were in the old palace on the √Æle de la Cit√©. The offices of the Provost of Paris, the King's governor, were in the Ch√¢telet fortress, which also served as a prison. The city administration, run by the Provost of the Merchants, was in the H√¥tel de Ville. The commercial center of the city was the river port, located mostly on the right bank between the Place de Greve and the Quai Saint Paul, not far from les Halles, the central market of the city. The colleges of the University occupied buildings on the side of Mount Saint-Genevieve, on the left bank. On the right bank Paris was bordered by the wall begun in 1566 by Charles V, and later finished by Louis XIII in 1635. The wall was four meters high and two meters thick, and was reinforced by fourteen bastions ranging in size from 30 to 290 meters, and by a moat 25 to 30 meters wide, which was always kept full of water. Access to the city was by fourteen gates, each of which had a drawbridge over the moat. The gates were closed at night, usually between seven in the evening and five in the morning, with the schedule changing depending upon the season. The left bank did not have any recent fortifications; it was still protected by the old wall of King Philip Augustus. The western limits of the city; the Tuileries Gardens and the Porte de la Conference, in about 1680 The city wall did not mark the real edge of the city; there were some rural areas, with gardens and orchards, inside the walls, and there were many buildings and houses outside. Outside the walls there were a number of faubourgs, or suburbs; on the left bank, the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s was a virtual town, with its own fair and farms. The Faubourg of Saint-Jacques also on the left bank, was largely occupied by monasteries. The Faubourg Saint-Victor and Faubourg Saint-Marcel were crowded and growing. On the right bank were the Faubourgs of Saint-Honor√©, Montmartre, Saint-Denis, du Temple, and the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, filled with artisans and workshops. The edges of the growing city were not clearly defined until 1638, when the royal government drew a new line, which included the Faubourgs on both the right and left banks. On the left bank it reached south as far as the site of the future observatory, and included the all the area of the modern fifth and sixth arrondissements. On the right bank, the new boundary followed the line of new fortifications constructed by Louis XIII, along the modern boulevards de la Madeleine, des Capucines, des Italiens, Montmartre and Poissonniere. In 1670, Louis XIV declared that France was safe from attack and the walls were no longer necessary, and they were gradually replaced by boulevards lined by trees. The area of the city approximately doubled from what it had been early in the century, from 500 to about 1100 hectares. In 1674, the administrators marked the border more precisely, planting thirty- five marble or cut stone pillars and markers, twenty-two on the right bank and thirteen on the left. On the right bank, it began at the Place de la Concorde, passed by the sites of future Gare du Nord and de l'Est and reached almost to the modern avenue de la Republique and Place de la Nation, and came back to the river again at Bercy. On the left bank, the edges of the city were at rue de Tolbiac to the east and close to the modern Pont d'Alma to the west. Parisians A baker and his family, by Jean Michelin, 1656 (Metropolitan Museum of Art) There was no official census of the city's population in the 17th century, but, using tax records, the amount of wheat consumed and church baptism records, modern historians estimate that it increased from about 300,000 in 1600 to 415,000 in 1637 to about 500,000 in about 1680. An account published in 1665 by Lemaire estimated that there were 23,000 houses in Paris, each inhabited by an average of twenty persons. Paris society was structured in a formal and rigid hierarchy. At the top were the nobles, known as personnes de qualit√©, meaning that they had no profession, unlike the artisans and merchants. They were subdivided into four categories; the highest were the titled nobility, gentlemen of the royal chamber and marshals of France, who had the titles of duke, marquis, comte, and baron. Just below them were those with the lesser rank of chevalier or seigneur. A bourgeois of Paris by Claes Jansz (1618) Wife of a Parisian nobleman (1618) The third level of nobles who held their title because of their function, as members of the highest bodies of state, the Parlement of Paris, the Grand Council, the Chambre des comptes, and the Cour des Aides. They were known as the Noblesse de la Grand Robe, the high nobility of the robe, because of the ceremonial costumes they wore. They usually purchased their titles, but once acquired they became hereditary. Below them were nobles of the petit robe, with high positions in the less important government bodies and less impressive ceremonial costumes. Below them, at the lowest edge of the nobility, were the ecuyers; some were from the ancient nobility, but many more recent arrivals, who had purchased a title or position at court. The members of the nobility of all levels usually had their own town houses, and most lived in the Marais, and later, on the newly created √éle Saint-Louis and Faubourg Saint-Germain. A street vendor selling firewood (1618) A Parisienne selling brooms Just below the nobles and ecuyers but above the bourgeois were the notables, who were largely officials in the lesser government structures; officials in the treasury, royal accountants, and lawyers at the Parlement or other high courts. The notables but included prominent doctors and a few highly successful artists, including Claude Vignon and Simon Vouet. Just below the notables were those Parisians entitled to be called Ma√Ætre; lawyers, notaries, and procureurs. Below the notables and Ma√Ætres was a far larger class, the Bourgeoisie or middle class, which was equally divided into categories. At the top were the Honorable hommes, a category which included the most successful merchants, artisans who had ten or fifteen employees, and a considerable number of successful painters, sculptors and engravers. Below them were the marchands or merchants, successful members of all the different professions. Twenty percent had their own shops. Below them were the ma√Ætres and then the compagnons, craftsmen who had finished their apprenticeships. They usually lived in a single room, and were often not far above poverty. Below the craftsmen and artisans was the largest class of Parisians; domestic servants, manual workers with no special qualifications, laborers, prostitutes, street sellers, rag-pickers, and a hundred other trades, with no certain income. They lived a very precarious existence.Pillorget, R., Nouvelle Histoire de Paris. Paris sous les premiers Bourbons (1594-1661), pages 122-134 Beggars and the poor A Paris beggar, after an engraving by Jacques Callot A large number of Parisians were elderly, sick, or unable to work because of injuries. They were the responsibility of the Catholic church in each parish; an official of the parish was supposed to keep track of them and provide them with a small amount of money. In times of food shortages, such as the famine of 1629, or epidemics, the church was often unable to take care of all of the needs of those in the parish. In the case of vagabonds, those who came to Paris from outside the city but had no profession or home, there was no structure to take care of them. There were a very large number of mendiants, or beggars, on the streets of Paris. One estimate put their number at forty thousand at the beginning of the reign of Louis XIII. It was particularly feared that beggars from other cities would bring infectious diseases into the city. There was an outbreak of bubonic plague in the city in 1631, and there were frequent cases of leprosy, tuberculosis and syphilis in Paris. The Parisians learned that Geneva, Venice, Milan, Antwerp and Amsterdam had chosen to confine their beggars in hospitals created for that purpose. In 1611, the Bureau of the City ordered that the vagabonds should be taken off the streets. Those who could not show they were born in Paris were required to leave the city. Those who were native Parisians were put to work. When the news of the decree spread, many of the vagabonds and beggars quickly departed the city. The police rounded up the rest, confined the men who were able to work in a large house in the faubourg Saint-Victor, and the women and children in another large house in faubourg Saint-Marcel. Those with incurable illnesses or unable to work were taken to a third house in the faubourg Saint- Germain. They were supposed to awake at five in the morning and to work from 5:30 in the morning until 7:00 in the evening. The work consisted of grinding wheat, brewing beer, cutting wood, and other menial tasks; the women and girls over the age of eight were employed by sewing. The city judged the program a success, and acquired three large new buildings for the beggars. But within four years the program was abandoned; the work was poorly organized, and many of the beggars simply escaped. Charities - Renaudot and Vincent De Paul The hardships and medical needs of the Paris poor were energetically addressed by one of the first Paris philanthropists, Theophraste Renaudot, a proteg√© of Cardinal Richelieu. Renaudot, a Protestant and a physician, founded the first weekly newspaper in France, La Gazette in 1631. Based on the newspaper, he founded the first employment bureau in Paris, matching employers and job- seekers. He organized public conferences on topics of public interest. He opened the first public pawn-shop in Paris, the mont-de-Piet√©, so the poor could get money for belongings at reasonable rates. He also organized the first free medical consultations for the poor. This put him into opposition with the medical school of the University of Paris, which denounced him. After the death of his protectors, Richelieu and Louis XIII, the University had his medical license taken away, but eventually the University itself began to offer free medical consultations to the poor. A Fille de la Charit√© delivering soup and bread to the sick Another pioneer in helping the Paris poor during the period was Vincent de Paul. As a young man, he had been captured by pirates and held as a slave for two years. When he finally returned to France, he entered the clergy and became chaplain to the French prisoners in Paris sentenced to the galleys. He had a talent for organization and inspiration; in 1629 he persuaded wealthy residents in the parish of Saint-Sauveur to fund and participate in charitable works for the poor of the Paris; with its success, he founded similar confr√©ries for the parishes Saint-Eustache, Saint-Beno√Æt, Saint-Merri and Saint Sulpice. In 1634, he took on a much more challenging task; providing assistance to the patients of the city's oldest and largest hospital, the H√¥tel-Dieu, which was terribly overcrowded and under-funded. He persuaded wealthy women from noble families to prepare and distribute meat broth to the patients, and to help the patients with their needs. He instructed the women visiting the hospital to dress simply, and to speak to the poor with \\"humility, gentleness and cordiality.\\" As time went on, he discovered that some of the wealthy women were delegating the servants to do the charitable work. In 1633, he founded a new charitable order for young women from more modest families, the Filles de la Charit√©, to carry on the work of feeding the poor. The young women, dressed in gray skirts and white cornettes, carried pots of soup to the poor of the neighborhoods. The first house of the order was at La Chapelle. Between 1638 and 1643, eight more houses of the order were opened to serve food to the poor. In 1638, he took on another ambitious project; providing food and care for the abandoned infants of Paris, the enfants trouv√©s. Four hundred unwanted babies were abandoned each year at the maison de la Couche, or maternity hospital, where most died in a very short time. There was only one nurse for four or five children, they were given laudanum to keep them from crying, and they were often sold to professional beggars, who used them to inspire pity and donations. In 1638, he persuaded wealthy Parisians to donate money to establish a home for found children on rue des Boulangers, near the porte Saint-Victor. De Paul and the sisters of the order made visits to churches to bring babies abandoned there at night to the new home. His work came to the attention of the King and Queen, who provided funding in 1645 to build a large new home for abandoned children near Saint-Lazare. De Paul died in 1660. In 1737, he was canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church. Thieves and the Courtyard of Miracles Caricature of the king of Paris thieves C√∂esre, in the Courtyard of Miracles, by Lagniet (1663) Beside the beggars and the poor there was another underclass in Paris, composed of thieves. They often were expert in cutting the cords of the purses that wealthy Parisians carried around their necks and running off with them. They also sometimes pretended to be blind or lame, so they could attract charity from the Parisians. In the 17th century the most famous residence of such thieves was the Cour des Miracles, or Courtyard of Miracles, located between rue Montorgueil, the convent of the Filles-Dieu, and rue Neuve-Saint-Saveur, in the center of the city. It was named because its residents often appeared to blind or lame when on the streets but were perfectly whole when they returned home. It was described by the 18th-century Paris historian Sauval, based on his father's description of a visit to the Courtyard. \\"To enter there you have to descend a rather long slope, twisting and uneven. I saw a house half-buried in mud, crumbling with age and rot, which had only a fraction of its roof tiles, where however were lodged more than fifty families, with all their legitimate, illegitimate and undetermined children. I was assured that in this house and its neighbors there were more than five hundred large families living one on top of the other\\". The courtyard was a school of crime; the children were taught the best techniques for stealing purses and escaping, and were given a final examination of stealing a purse in a public place, such as the Cemetery of Saints-Innocents, under the scrutiny of their teachers. The Courtyard had its own King, laws, officers and ceremonies. The young inhabitants became expert in not only stealing, but also in simulating blindness, gangrene, rabies, and a wide variety of horrifying wounds and illnesses. In 1630, the city wanted to build a street through the Courtyard to connect rue Saint-Sauveur and rue Neuve- Saint-Sauveur, but the workmen were showered with rocks and assaulted and beaten by the residents of the Courtyard, and the project was abandoned.Sauval, Histoire et recherches des antiquiti√©s de la ville de Paris, C. Moette, (1724) Volume 1, page 510 In 1668, shortly after being named Lieutenant-General of Police, de la Reynie decided to finally put an end to the Courtyard. He gathered one hundred fifty soldiers, gendarmes and sappers to break down the walls, and stormed the Courtyard, under a barrage or rocks from the residents. The inhabitants finally fled, and de la Reynie tore down their houses. The empty site was divided into lots and houses constructed. and is now part of the Benne-Nouvelle quarter. Sauval's description of the Courtyard was the source for Victor Hugo's courtyard of miracles in his novel Notre-Dame de Paris, though Hugo moved the period from the 17th century to the Middle Ages. City government King Louis XIII listens to the Provost of the Merchants of Paris (December 23, 1628) King Henry IV, who frequently was short of money, made one decision which was to have fateful consequences for Paris for two centuries to follow. At the suggestion of his royal secretary, Charles Paulet, he required the hereditary nobility of France to pay an annual tax for their titles. This tax, called \\"la Paullete\\" for the secretary, was so successful that it was expanded, so that wealthy Parisians who were not noble could purchase positions which gave them noble rank. When kings needed more money, they simply created more positions. By 1665, during the reign of Louis XIV, there were 45,780 positions of state. It cost 60,000 livres to become President of the Parlement of Paris, and 100,000 livres to be President of the Grand Council. During the reign of Louis XIII, the King's official representative in Paris was the Pr√©v√¥t or Provost of Paris, who had his offices at the Ch√¢telet fortress, but most of the day-to-day administration of the city was conducted from the recently finished H√¥tel de Ville, under the direction of the Provost of the Merchants, elected by the bourgeois or upper- middle class of Paris. The status of bourgeois was granted to those Parisians who owned a house, paid taxes, had long been resident in Paris, and had an \\"honorable profession\\", which included magistrates; lawyers and those engaged in commerce, but excluded those whose business was providing food. Almost all the Provosts for generations came from among about fifty wealthy families. Elections were held for Provost every two years, and for the four positions of echevins, or deputies. After the election, held on August 16 of even-numbered years, the new Provost and new echevins were taken by carriage to the Louvre where they took an oath in person to the King and Queen. The H√¥tel de Ville in 1683 The position of Provost of the Merchants had no salary, but it had many benefits. The Provost received 250,000 livres a year for expenses, he was exempt from certain taxes, and he could import goods without duty into the city. He wore an impressive ceremonial costume of a velour robe, silk habit and a crimson cloak, and was entitled to cover his horse and his dress his household servants in a special red livery. He had his own honor guard, made up of twelve men chosen from the bourgeoisie, and he was always accompanied by four of these guards when about the city on official business. The Provost was assisted by twenty-four conseillers de ville, a city council, who were chosen by the Provost and echevins, when there was an opening. Beneath the Provost and echevins there were numerous municipal officials, all selected from the bourgeoisie; two procureurs, three receveurs, a greffier, ten huissiers, a Master of Bridges, a Commissaire of the Quais, fourteen guardians of the city gates, and the Governor of the clock tower. Most of the positions of the Bureau of the City had to be purchased with a large sum of money, but once acquired, many of them could be held for life. Each of the sixteen quarters or neighborhoods of the city also had its own administrator, called a quarternier, who had eight deputies, called dizainiers. These positions had small salaries but were prestigious and came with generous tax exemptions. The Bureau of the City had its own courts and prison. The city officials were responsible for maintaining order in the city, fire safety, and security in the Paris streets. They assured that the gates were closed and locked at night, and that the chains were put up on the streets. They were responsible for the city's small armed force, the Milice Municipale and the Chevaliers de la guet, or night watchmen. The local officials of each quarter were responsible for keeping lists of the residents of every house in their neighborhoods, and also keeping track of strangers. They recorded the name of a traveler coming into the quarter, whether he stayed in a hotel, a cabaret with rooms, or a private home. The Provost of the Merchants and his deputies discuss how to honor Louis XIV on his recovery from an illness, by Hyacinthe Rigaud (1689) During the second half of the 17th century, most of the independent institutions of the Parisian bourgeois had their powers taken away and transferred to the King. In March 1667 the King created the position of Lieutenant General of the police, with his office at the Chatelet, and gave the position to La Reynie, who held it for thirty years, from 1667 to 1697. He was responsible not only for the police, but also for supervising weights and measures, the cleaning and lighting of the streets, the supply of food to the markets, and the regulation of the corporations, all matters which previously had been overseen by the merchants of Paris. The last of the ancient corporations of Paris, the corporation of the water merchants, had its authority over river commerce taken away and given to the Crown in 1672. In 1681, Louis XIV took away almost all of the real powers of the municipal government. The Provost of the Merchants and the Echevins were still elected by the Bourgeois, but they had no more real power. Selling positions in the city government became an effective way to raise funds for the royal treasury. All other municipal titles below the Provost and Echevins had to be purchased directly from the King. Industry and commerce At the beginning of the 17th century, the most important industry of the city was textiles; weaving and dyeing cloth, and making bonnets, belts, ribbons, and an assortment of other items of clothing. The dyeing industry was located in the Faubourg Saint- Marcel, along the River Bievre, which was quickly polluted by the workshops and dye vats along its banks. The largest workshops there, which made the fortunes of the families Gobelin, Canaye and Le Peultre, were dyeing six hundred thousand pieces of cloth a year in the mid-16th century, but, because of growing foreign competition, their output dropped to one hundred thousand pieces at the start of the 17th century, and the whole textile industry was struggling. Henry IV and Louis XIII observed that wealthy Parisians were spending huge sums to import silks, tapestries, glassware leather goods and carpets from Flanders, Spain, Italy and Turkey. They encouraged French businessmen to make the same luxury products in Paris. Royal manufactories Colbert visits the Gobelins tapestry workshop (1665). With this royal encouragement, the financier Moisset launched an enterprise to make cloth woven with threads of gold, silver and silk. It failed, but was replaced by other successful ventures. The first tapestry workshop was opened, with royal assistance, in the Louvre, then at the Savonnerie and at Chaillot. The Gobelins' enterprise of dyers brought in two Flemish tapestry makers in 1601 and began to make its own tapestries in the Flemish style. Master craftsmen from Spain and Italy opened small enterprises to make high-quality leather goods. Workshops making fine furniture were opened by German craftsmen in the faubourg Saint-Antoine. A royal glass factory was opened 1601 in Saint- Germain-des-Pr√©s to compete with Venetian glassmakers. A large factory was opened at Reuilly to produce and polish mirrors made by Saint-Gobain. A carpet made by the royal Savonnerie workshop for the Louvre Under Louis XIV and his minister of finance, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, the royal manufactories were expanded. The most skilled artisans in Europe were recruited and brought to Paris. In 1665, the enterprise of Hindret, located in the old ch√¢teau de Madrid in the Bois de Boulogne, produced the first French silk stockings. The Gobelins' workshops began to produce furniture for the royal residences as well as tapestries, while the Savonnerie Manufactory produced magnificent carpets for the royal palaces. The quality of the carpets, tapestries, furniture, glass and other products was unmatched; the problem was that it was nearly all destined for a single client, the King, and his new residence at Versailles. The royal manufactories were kept going by enormous subsidies from the royal treasury. Craftsmen and corporations The greatest resource of the Paris economy was its large number of skilled workers and craftsmen. Since the Middle Ages, each profession had had its own corporation, which set strict work rules and requirements to enter the profession. There were separate corporations for drapers, tailors, candle-makers, grocer-pharmacists, hat- makers, bonnet-makers, ribbon-makers, saddle-makers, stone carvers, bakers of spice breads, and many more. Doctors and barbers were members of the same corporation. Access in many professions was strictly limited to keep down competition, and the sons of craftsmen had priority. Those entering had to advance from apprentice to companion-worker to master worker, or ma√Ætre. In 1637, there were 48,000 recorded skilled workers in Paris, and 13,500 ma√Ætres. Luxury goods Gallery of shops in the Palais de Paris, by Abraham Bosse (1638) The most important market for luxury goods was located on the √éle-de- la-Cit√©, in the spacious gallery of the old royal palace, where it had been since at least the fourteenth century. The palace was no longer occupied by the King, and had become the administrative headquarters of the kingdom, occupied by the courts, the treasury, and other government offices. The small shops in the gallery sold a wide variety of expensive gowns, cloaks, perfumes, hats, bonnets, children's wear, gloves, and other items of clothing. Books were another luxury items sold there; they were hand-printed, expensively bound, and rare. Clocks and watches were another important luxury good made in Paris shops. Access to the profession was strictly controlled; at the beginning of the 17th century, the guild of horlogers had twenty-five members. Each horloger was allowed to have no more than one apprentice, and apprenticeship lasted six years. By 1646, under new rules of the guild, the number of masters was limited to seventy-two, and the apprenticeship was lengthened to eight years. Most of the important public buildings, including the H√¥tel de Ville and the Samaritaine pump, had their own clocks made by the guild. Two families, the Martinet and the Bidauld, dominated the profession; they had their workshops in the galleries of the Louvre, along with many highly skilled artists and craftsmen. Nearly all the clock and watchmakers were Protestants; when Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes in 1685, most of the horlogers refused to renounce their faith and emigrated to Geneva, England and Holland, and France no longer dominated the industry. Religion Jean- Fran√ßois de Gondi, the first Archbishop of Paris. Members of the Gondi family were the bishops and archbishops of the city from 1570 to 1662. For most of the 17th century Paris was governed by two Cardinals, Richelieu and Mazarin, and Paris was a fortress of the Roman Catholic faith, but it was subject to considerable religious turmoil within. In 1622, after centuries of being a bishopric under the control of the Archbishop of Sens, Paris was finally given its own Archbishop, Jean-Fran√ßois de Gondi, from a noble and wealthy Florentine-French family. His elder brother had been Bishop of Paris before him, and he was succeeded as Archbishop by his nephew; members of the Gondi family were the bishops and archbishops of Paris for nearly a century from 1570 to 1662. The hierarchy of the Church in Paris were all members of the higher levels of the nobility, with close connections to the royal family. As one modern historian noted, their dominant characteristics were \\"nepotism...ostentatious luxury, arrogance, and personal conduct far removed from the morality they preached.\\" While the leaders of the church in Paris were more concerned with high political matters, the lower levels of the clergy were agitating for reform and more engagement with the poor. The Vatican had decided to create seminaries in Paris to give priests more training; the Seminary of Saint-Nicolas-de-Chardonnet was opened in 1611, the Seminary of Sant-Magliore in 1624, the Seminary of Vaugirard in 1641, before moving to Saint-Sulpice in 1642; and the Seminary of Bons-Enfants also opened in 1642. The seminaries became centers for reform and change. Thanks in large part to the efforts of Vincent de Paul, the parishes became much more actively involved in giving assistance to the poor and the sick, and giving schooling to young children. Confreries or brotherhoods of wealthy nobles, such as the Compagnie du Saint-Sacrement, were formed, to assist the poor in Paris, to convert Protestants, and to send missions abroad to convert the inhabitants of new French colonies. More than eighty religious orders also established themselves in Paris; sixty orders, forty for women and twenty for men, were established between 1600 and 1660. These included the Franciscans at Picpus in 1600, the Congregation of the Feuillants next to the gates of the Tuillieries palace in 1602; the Dominican Order at the same location in 1604, and the Carmelites from Spain in 1604 at Notre-Dame des Champs. The Capuchins were invited from Italy by Marie de' Medici, and opened convents in the faubourg Saint-Honor√©, and the Marais, and a novitiate in the Faubourg Saint-Jacques. They became particularly useful, because, before the formation of a formal fire department by Napoleon, they were the principal fire-fighters of the city. They were joined by the Dominicans and by the Jesuits, who founded the College of Clermont of the Sorbonne, and built the opulent new Church of Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis next to their headquarters on rue Saint-Antoine. The arrival of all these new orders, directed from Rome and entirely out of the control of the Archbishop of Paris, caused the alarm and eventually the hostility of the Paris church establishment. Followers of the church in Paris were divided by a new theological movement called Jansenism, founded by a Dutch theologian named Cornelius Jansen, who died in 1638. It was based at the Port-Royal-des-Champs Abbey, and was based on variations of the doctrines of original sin and predestination which were strongly opposed by the Jesuits. Followers of the Jansenists included the philosopher Blaise Pascal and playwright Jean Racine. Cardinal Richelieu had the leader of the Jansenists in Paris put in prison in 1638, and the Jesuits persuaded Pope Innocent X to condemn Jansenism as a heresy in 1653, but the doctrines spread and Jansenism was broadly tolerated by most Parisians, and contributed to undermining the unquestioned authority of the church which followed in the 18th century. Henry IV had declared a policy of tolerance toward the Protestants of France in the Edict of Nantes in 1598. On August 1, 1606, at the request of his chancellor, Sully, Henry IV granted the Protestants of Paris permission to build a church, as long as it was far from the center of the city. The new church was constructed at Charenton, six kilometers from the Bastille. In 1680, there were an estimated eight thousand five hundred Protestants in the city, or about two percent of the population. Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes in 1685, leading to an important exodus of Protestants from the city, and forcing those who remained to practice their faith in secret. The Jewish population of Paris in the 17th century was extremely small, following centuries of persecution and expulsion; there were only about a dozen Jewish families in the city, coming originally from Italy, Central Europe, Spain or Portugal. Daily life Public transportation At the beginning of the 17th century, the nobles and wealthy Parisians traveled by carriage, horse, or in a chair inside an elegant box carried by servants. In 1660, there were three hundred carriages in the city. Less fortunate travelers had to go on foot. Paris could be crossed on foot in less than thirty minutes. However, it could be a very unpleasant walk; the narrow streets were crowded with carts, carriages, wagons, horses, cattle and people; there were no sidewalks, and the paving stones were covered with a foul-smelling soup of mud, garbage and horse and other animal droppings. Shoes and fine clothing were quickly ruined. In about 1612 a new form of public transport appeared, called the fiacre, a coach and driver which could be hired for short journeys. The business was started by an entrepreneur from Amiens named Sauvage on the rue Saint-Martin. It took its name from the enseigne or hanging sign on the building, with an image of Saint Fiacre. By 1623, there were several different companies offering the service. In 1657, a decree of the Parlement of Paris gave the exclusive rights to operate coaches for hire to an ecuyer of the King, Pierre Hugon, the sieur of Givry. In 1666, the Parlement fixed the fare at twenty sous for the first hour and fifteen sous for each additional hour; three livres and ten sols for a half day, and four livres and ten sols if the passenger desired to go into the countryside outside Paris, which required a second horse. In 1669, fiacres were required to have large numbers painted in yellow on the sides and rear of the coach. In January 1662 the mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal, the inventor of one of the first calculating machines, proposed an even more original and rational means of transport; buying seats in carriages which traveled on a schedule on regular routes from one part of the city to another. He prepared a plan and the enterprise was funded by three of his friends, and began service in March 1662. Each carriage carried eight passengers, and a seat in one cost five sols. The doors of the carriages had the emblem of the city of Paris, and the coachmen wore the city colors, red and blue. The coaches followed five different itineraries, including from rue Saint-Antoine to the Luxembourg by the Pont Neuf, from the Luxembourg to rue Montmartre, and a circular line, called \\"The Tour de Paris.\\" Pascal's company was a great success at the beginning, but over the years it was not able to make money; after the death of Pascal, it went out of business in 1677. The fiacre remained the main means of public transport until well into the 19th century, when it was gradually replaced by the omnibus, the horse-drawn tramway, and the eventually by the motorized fiacre, or taxicab. Street lights At the beginning of the century, the streets of Paris were dark at night, lit only here and there with candles or oil lanterns. In 1662, the Abb√© Laudati received royal letters of patent to establish a service providing torch- carriers and lantern-carriers for those who wanted to voyage through the streets at night. Lantern-bearers were located at posts eight hundred steps apart on the main streets, and customers paid five sols for each portion of a torch used, or for fifteen minutes of lantern-light. The company of torch and lantern bearers was in business until 1789. In 1667, the royal government decided to go further, and to require the placement of lanterns in each quarter, and on every street and place, at the expense of the owners of the buildings on that street. In the first year, three thousand oil lanterns were put in place. The system was described by English traveler, Martin Lister, in 1698: \\"The streets are lit all winter and even during the full moon! The lanterns are suspended from in the middle of the street at a height of twenty feet and at a distance of twenty steps between each lantern.\\" The lamps were enclosed in a glass cage two feet high, with a metal plaque on top. The cords were attached to iron bars fixed to the walls, so they could be lowered and refilled with oil. The King issued a commemorative medal to celebrate the event, with the motto Urbis securitas et nitor (\\"for the security and illumination of the city\\"). Water The Samaritaine pump on the Pont Neuf supplied water to the Tuileries Palace and Louvre. In the 17th century the drinking water of Paris came mostly from Seine, despite pollution of the river from the nearby tanneries and butcher shops. In the 18th century, taking drinking water from the river in the center of the city was finally banned. Some water also came from outside the city, from springs and reservoirs in Belleville, the Pr√© Saint-Gervais and La Vilette, carried in aqueducts built by the monks to the monasteries on the right bank. These also provided water to the palaces of the Louvre and the Tuileries, which together consumed about half the water supply of Paris. In 1607, Henry IV decided to build a large pump on the Seine next to the Louvre to increase the water supply for the palaces. The pump was located on the second arch of the Pont Neuf, in a high building decorated with a bas-relief of Jesus and the Samaritan at the wells of Jacob, which gave the pump the popular name of Samaritaine. The pump was finished in October 1608. The water was lifted by a wheel with eight buckets. it was supposed to lift 480,000 liters of water a day, but, because of numerous breakdowns, it only provided 20,000 liters a day, used by the neighboring palaces and gardens. Paris fountains of the 17th century In 1670, the city contracted with the engineer in charge of the Samaritaine to build a second pump on the pont Notre-Dame, then, in the same year on the same bridge, a third pump. The two new pumps went into service in 1673. A series of wheels lifted the water up to the top of a tall square tower, where it was transferred to pipes and flowed by gravity to the palaces. The new pumps were able to provide two million liters a day. Marie de' Medici needed abundant water for her new palace and gardens on the left bank, which had few sources of water. Recalling that the ancient Romans had built an aqueduct from Rungis to their baths on the left bank, Sully, the minister of public works, sent engineers to find the route of the old aqueduct. A new aqueduct thirteen kilometers long was constructed 1613 and 1623, ending near the present-day Observatory, bringing 240,000 liters of water a day, enough for the dowager Queen's gardens and fountains. It enabled her to construct one of the best- known fountains in Paris today, the Medici Fountain, a reminder of her childhood in the Pitti Palace in Florence, in the gardens of the Luxembourg Palace.A water-bearer (1675) For those outside the palaces and monasteries, and the homes of nobles who had their own wells, the water came from the fountains of Paris. The first public fountain had been built in 1183 by King Philip Augustus at Les Halles, the central market, and a second, the Fontaine des Innocents was built in the 13th century. By the beginning of the 17th century there were a dozen fountains functioning within the center of the city. Between 1624 and 1628 Louis XIII built thirteen new fountains, providing water and decoration on the Parvis of the Cathedral of Notre Dame, on the Place de Greve, Place Maubert, Saint Severin, Place Royale, rue de Buci, porte Saint Michel, and other central points. The water was transported from the fountains to the residences of the Parisians by domestic servants or by water bearers, who, for a charge, carried it in two covered wooden buckets attached to a strap over his shoulders and to a frame. There were frequent disputes between water-bearers and domestic servants all trying to get water from the fountains. Frequently the water-bearers skipped the lines at the fountains and simply took the water from the Seine. Food and drink Bread, meat and wine were the bases of the Parisian diet in the 17th century. As much of sixty percent of the income of working-class Parisians was spent on bread alone. The taste of Parisian bread changed beginning in 1600 with the introduction of yeast, and, thanks to the introduction of milk into the bread, it became softer. Poor harvests and speculation on the price of grain caused bread shortages and created hunger and riots, particularly in the winter of 1693-1694. Parisians consumed the meat of 50,000 beef cattle in 1634, increasing to 60,000 at the end of the century, along with 350,000 sheep and 40,000 pigs. The animals were taken live to the courtyards of the butcher shops in the neighborhoods, where they were slaughtered and the meat prepared. The best cuts of meat went to the nobility and upper classes, while working class Parisians consumed sausages, tripe and less expensive cuts, and made bouillon, or meat broth. A large quantity of fish was also consumed, particularly on Fridays and Catholic holidays. Wine was the third essential for the Parisians; not surprisingly, when the price of bread and meat increased, and living became more difficult, the consumption of wine also increased. Wine arrived by boat in large kegs at the ports near the Hotel de Ville from Bordeaux, Burgundy, Champagne, and the Loire Valley. Less expensive wines came by wagon from vineyards on Montmartre and the surrounding √éle-de- France. The tax on wine was a major source of income for the royal government; the wine was taxed as soon as it arrived at the port; the tax rose from three livres for a muid or barrel of wine in 1638 to 15 livres for wine arriving by land in 1680 and 18 livres for wine arriving by water. Cabarets The cabaret was the ancestor of the restaurant, which did not appear until the 18th century. Unlike a tavern, which served wine by the pot without a meal, a cabaret only served wine accompanied by a meal, served on a tablecloth. Customers might sing if they had drunk enough wine, but in this era cabarets did not have formal programs of entertainment. They were popular meeting- places for Parisian artists and writers; La Fontaine, Moliere and Racine frequented the Mouton Blanc on rue du Vieux-Colombier, and later the Croix de Lorraine on the modern rue de Bourg-Tibourg. Coffee and the first caf√©s Coffee was introduced to Paris from Constantinople in 1643; a merchant from the Levant sold cups of cahove in the covered passage between the rue Saint- Jacques and the Petit-Pont; and it was served as a novelty by Mazarin and in some noble houses, but it did not become fashionable until 1669 with the arrival of Soliman Aga Mustapha Aga, the ambassador of the Turkish sultan, Mahomet IV. In 1672, a coffee house was opened by an Armenian named Pascal at the Foire-Saint-Germain, serving coffee for two sous and six deniers for a cup. it was not a commercial success, and Pascal departed for London. A new caf√© was opened by a Persian named Gregoire, who opened a coffee house near the theater of the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise on rue Mazarin. When the theater moved to rue des Foss√©s-Saint-Germain in 1689, he moved the caf√© with them. The caf√© did not become a great success until it was taken over by a Sicilian, Francesco Procopio dei Coltelli, who had first worked for Pascal in 1672. He bought the caf√© and began serving coffee, tea, chocolate, liqueurs, ice creams and confitures. The new Cafe Procope became fashionable and successful, and was soon copied by other caf√©s in the city. Processions, carrousels and fireworks The fire of Saint Jean, a midsummer night festival, at the H√¥tel de Ville (1617) The life of Parisians in the 17th century was usually hard and short, and perhaps for this reason the calendar was filled with holidays and celebrations. Religious processions were not as numerous as they had been in the Middle Ages, but they were colorful and impressive. The most important was in honor of the patron saint of the city, Saint Genevi√®ve, from the church on the left bank containing her tomb to the Cathedral of Notre-Dame. The procession was led by the archbishop of Paris and the Abb√© of the monastery of Sainte-Genevi√®ve, in their full regalia and barefoot, preceded by one hundred and fifty monks and nuns. Behind them came the relics of the saint, carried by twenty men, also barefoot and dressed in white, carrying a jeweled chasse, followed by the members of the Parlement of Paris in their ceremonial scarlet robes, and the leaders of the leading guilds of craftsmen and artisans. There were processions for many different saints and holidays, which sometimes led to confrontations between the monks of different orders. According to Madame de Sevign√©, in 1635 a procession of Benedictine monks refused to give way to a procession of Rogations, leading to a fight in the street in which two monks were struck with crucifixes and knocked unconscious. A ceremony from pre- Christian times, the Fire of Saint-Jean, was avidly celebrated in Paris on June 23, to mark the summer solstice. It was an enormous bonfire or series of fires, with burning twenty meters high, in front of the H√¥tel de Ville. From the 14th century onwards, the fire was traditionally lit by the King himself. After the lighting, the crowd was offered wine and bread by the municipal government. While Henry IV and Louis XIII regularly took part, Louis XIV, discontented with the Parisians, only lit the fire once, and it was never lit by Louis XV or Louis XVI. The Carrousel in 1612 to celebrate the completion of Place Royale, now Place des Vosges, (1612). Carnavalet museum Cavaliers in the Grand Carrousel of 1662 For the nobility, the most important event at the beginning of the century was the carrousel, a series of exercises and games on horseback. These events were designed to replace the tournament, which had been banned after 1559 when King Henry II was killed in a jousting accident. In the new, less dangerous version, riders usually had to pass their lance through the interior of a ring, or strike mannequins with the heads of Medusa, Moors and Turks. The first carrousel in Paris was held in 1605 in the grand hall of the H√¥tel Petit-Bourbon, an annex of the Louvre used for ceremonies. An elaborate carrousel took place 5‚Äì7 April 1612 at the Place Royale (now the Place des Vosges) to celebrate its completion. An even grander carrousel was held on June 5‚Äì6, 1662 to celebrate the birth of the Dauphin, the son of Louis XIV. It was held on the square separating the Louvre from the Tuileries Palace, which afterwards became known as the Place du Carrousel. The ceremonial entry of the King into Paris also became an occasion for festivities. The return of Louis XIV and Queen Marie-Th√©r√®se to Paris after his coronation in 1660 was celebrated by a grand event on a fairground at the gates of the city, where large thrones were constructed for the new monarchs. After the ceremony the site became known as the Place du Tr√¥ne, or place of the Throne, until it became the Place de la Nation in 1880. Another traditional Parisian form of celebration, the grand fireworks display, was born in the 17th century. Fireworks were first mentioned in Paris in 1581, and Henry IV had put on a small display at the H√¥tel de Ville in 1598 after lighting the Fire of Saint Jean, but the first large show was given on April 12, 1612 following the Carrousel to mark the opening of the place Royale and the proposed marriage of Louis XIII with Anne of Austria. New innovations were introduced in 1615; allegorical figures of Jupiter on an eagle and Hercules, representing the King, were created with fireworks mounted on scaffolds next to the Seine and on a balcony of the Louvre. In 1618, the show was even more spectacular; rockets were launched into the sky which, according to one witness, the Abbot of Marolles, \\"burst into stars and serpents of fire.\\" Thereafter fireworks, launched from the quays of the Seine, were a regular feature of the celebrations of holidays and special events. All they lacked were color; all the fireworks were white or pale gold, until the introduction from China of colored fireworks in the 18th century. Sports and games The most popular sport for French nobles in the first part of the 17th century was the jeu de paume, a form of handball or tennis, which reached its peak of popularity under Henry IV, when there were more than 250 courts throughout the city. Louis XIV, however, preferred billiards, and the number of courts for jeu de paume dropped to 114. The owners of the courts found an original and effective strategy to survive; in 1667 they applied for and received permission to have billiards tables in their premises, and in 1727 they demanded and received the exclusive rights to operate public billiards parlors. Winters in Paris were much colder than today; Parisians enjoyed ice skating on the frozen Seine. File:Jeu de paume.jpgA match of jeu de paume File:P1160494 Carnavalet EFXVII Patineurs sur la Seine en 1608 P263 rwk.jpgIce skaters on the Seine in 1608 Press First page of the Mercure Galant (1672) The press had a difficult birth in Paris; all publications were carefully watched and censored by the royal authorities. The first regular publication was the Mercure fran√ßais, which first appeared in 1611, and then once a year until 1648. It was followed in January 1631 by a more frequent publication with a long title, Nouvelles ordinaries de divers androids. In the same year the prominent Parisian doctor and philanthropist, Th√©ophraste Renaudot, launched a weekly newspaper, La Gazette. Renaudot had good connections with Cardinal Richelieu, and his new paper was given royal patronage; La Gazette took over the earlier newspaper, and also became the first to have advertising. Later, in 1762, under the name Gazette de France, it became the official newspaper of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 1665, a new weekly, Le Journal des savants appeared, followed in 1672 by Le Mercure Galant. which in 1724 became the Mercure de France. The Mercure Galant was the first Paris periodical to report on fashion, and also became the first literary magazine; it published poetry and essays. The literature it published was not admired by everyone; the essayist Jean de La Bruy√®re described its literary quality as \\"immediately below nothing\\". Education Academies The young noblemen of Paris, since the end of the 16th century, attended special schools called academies, where they were taught a range of military skills: horseback riding, fencing, marksmanship, the art of fortification and organizing sieges, as well as the social skills that they needed to succeed at the court: dance, music, writing, arithmetic, drawing, and understanding heraldry and coats-of-arms. Each student had one or two valets, and the education cost between 700 and 1,000 ecus a year. By 1650, there were six academies in the city, mostly run by Italians. When the King departed Paris for Versailles, the large riding school of the Tuileries palace, the Manege, became part of one the academies, La Gu√©rini√©re. In 1789, during the French Revolution, it became the home of the French National Assembly. University In 1670 a fire destroyed much of the old College of Sorbonne, but fortunately spared the chapel. Cardinal Richelieu and Cardinal Mazarin lavished funds on the buildings of the University of Paris; Richelieu built a magnificent new chapel for the college of Sorbonne, which he headed, while Cardinal Mazarin built the equally-magnificent College of the Six Nations, to house nobles from the most recently added provinces of France, but the educational system of the University, which was primarily a school of theology, was in continual crisis, trying to deal with multiple heresies and challenges to its authority from newly arrived religious orders. The Sorbonne, the leading college, was challenged by the new College of Clermont, run by the Jesuit order. The royal government sought to turn the University into a training school for magistrates and state officials, but found that the faculty was only trained in canon, or church law. A fire in 1670 destroyed much of the old Sorbonne, but fortunately spared the domed chapel. By the end of the 17th century one-third of the colleges of the University had closed, and the remaining thirty-nine colleges had barely enough students to survive. Primary education In the 16th century, in the middle of the fierce struggle battle between Protestants and Catholics and between the hierarchy of the Paris church and the new religious orders in Paris, the authorities of the Paris church had tried to control the growing number of schools for Parisian children being organized in each parish, and particularly sought to limit the education of girls. However, throughout the 17th century, dozens of new schools were founded throughout the city for both boys and girls. By the 18th century a majority of children in Paris were in various kinds of schools; there were 316 private schools for paying students, regulated by the church, and another eighty free schools for the poor, including twenty-six schools for girls, plus additional schools founded by the new religious orders in Paris. Gardens and promenades Plan of the Tuileries garden from 1576 At the beginning of the 17th century there was one royal French Renaissance garden in Paris, the Jardin des Tuileries, created for Catherine de' Medici in 1564 to the west of her new Tuileries Palace. It was inspired by the gardens of her native Florence, particularly the Boboli Gardens, The garden was divided into squares of fruit trees and vegetable gardens divided by perpendicular alleys and by boxwood hedges and rows of cypress trees. Like Boboli, it featured a grotto, with faience \\"monsters.\\" Original design of the Medici Fountain in the Luxembourg Garden (1660 engraving) Under Henry IV the old garden was rebuilt, following a design of Claude Mollet, with the participation of Pierre Le N√¥tre, the father of the famous garden architect. A long terrace was built on the north side, looking down at the garden, and a circular basin was constructed, along with an octagonal basin on the central axis. Marie de' Medici, the widow of Henry IV, also was nostalgic for the gardens and promenades of Florence, particularly for the long tree-shaded alleys where the nobility could ride on foot, horseback and carriages, to see and be seen. In 1616, she had built the Cours-la-Reine a promenade 1.5 kilometers long, shaded by four rows of elm trees, along the Seine. The Jardin du Luxembourg was created by Marie de' Medici around her new home, the Luxembourg Palace. between 1612 and 1630. She began by planting two thousand elm trees, and commissioned a Florentine gardener, Tommaso Francini, to build the terraces and parterres, and the circular basin the center. The Medici Fountain was probably also the work of Francini, though it is sometimes attributed to Salomon de Brosse, the architect of the palace.Paris et ses fontaines, de la Renaissance √† nos jours, texts assembled by Dominque Massounie, Pauline- Prevost-Marcilhacy and Daniel Rabreau, D√©legation √† l'action artistique de la Ville de Paris, Collection Paris et son Patrimoine, Paris, 1995. The original fountain (see 1660 engraving at right) did not have statuary or a basin; these were added in the 19th century. The Jardin des Plantes in 1636, when it was the Jardin royal des herbs medicinales The Jardin des Plantes, originally called the Jardin royal des herbes m√©dicinales, was opened in 1626, on land purchased from the neighboring Abbey of Saint Victor. It was under the supervision of Guy de la Brosse, the physician of King Louis XIII, and its original purpose was to provide medicines for the court. In 1640, it became the first Paris garden to open to the public. The Tuileries gardens in the late 17th century, remade by Louis XIV and Le N√¥tre In 1664, Louis XIV had the Tuileries garden redesigned by Andr√© Le N√¥tre in the style of the classic French formal garden, with parterres bordered with low shrubs and bodies of water organized along a wide central axis. He added the Grand Carr√© around the circular basin at the east end of the garden, and the horseshoe-shaped ramp at the west end, leading to a view of the entire garden. In 1667, Charles Perrault, the author of Sleeping Beauty and other famous fairy tales, proposed to Louis XIV that the garden be opened at times to public. His proposal was accepted, and the public (with the exception of soldiers in uniform, servants and beggars) were allowed on certain days to promenade in the park. Culture and the arts Culture and the arts flourished in Paris in the 17th century, but, particularly under Louis XIV, the artists were dependent upon the patronage and taste of the King. As the philosopher Montesquieu wrote in his Lettres persanes in 1721: \\"The Prince impresses his character and his spirit on the Court; the Court on the City; and the City on the provinces.\\" Literature Of the prominent French writers of the century, Moliere, the Marquise de S√©vign√©, La Rochefoucauld and Charles Perrault were all born in Paris. Pierre Corneille was from Normandy, Descartes from the Touraine, Jean Racine and La Fontaine from Champagne; they were all drawn to Paris by the publishing houses, theaters, and literary salons of the city. The first literary academy, the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise, was formally by Cardinal Richelieu on January 27, 1635 to honor but also to exert control over the literary figures of France . Writers knew that any published word critical of the King or court would lead their exile from Paris. This happened to one of the founding members of the Academy, Roger de Bussy-Rabutin, who in 1660 wrote a scandalous satirical novel about life at the court of Louis XIV, which was circulated privately to amuse his friends.Although it was never published, he was banished from Paris to his chateau in Burgundy. Theater Set design for Andromed√© by Pierre Corneille, performed February 1, 1650 at the Petit- Bourbon palace The 17th century was an active and brilliant period for theater in Paris; it saw the founding of the Comedie-Fran√ßaise and the first productions of the works of Pierre Corneille, and Moliere. At the beginning of the century the pioneer Parisian theater company, the Confr√©rie de la Passion, installed itself in one of the buildings of the H√¥tel de Bourgogne at 23 rue Saint-Etienne; it also rented out the space to visiting English and Italian theater companies. The first permanent theatre in Paris was created by Cardinal Richelieu in 1635, within his Palais-Cardinal. It was located at the corner of rue Saint-Honor√© and rue de Valois. The first performance, of Mirame by Jean Desmarets de Saint-Sorlin, co-authored by Cardinal Richelieu, was given in 1641 with Louis XIII, Queen Anne of Austria, and Richelieu in the audience. A new theater company, the Illustre Th√©√¢tre, was founded in 1643 by Moliere and Madeleine B√©jart. Lacking a theater of their own, they performed at the jeu de Paume des Metayers, a tennis court near the porte de Nesle, then at another tennis court at 32 quai des Celestins. The Confr√©rie de la Passion tried to have the theater group closed down, claiming that they had the exclusive right to produce plays in Paris, but the new company persisted. Another new company appeared in the tennis court of the Marais, at rue Vieille-du-Temple, staging works by another new playwright, Pierre Corneille, including his classical tragedies Le Cid, 'Horace, Cinna and Polyeute. The tennis court was destroyed by a fire in January 1644, but the company succeeded in October 1644 in opening a new theater, the first in Paris exclusively designed for that purpose. Com√©die-Fran√ßaise Scene from Moliere's The Miser (1668) In 1661, Moliere moved his company into the theater built by Cardinal Richelieu at the Palais-Royal. After the death of Moliere in 1673, the composer Jean-Baptiste Lully expelled Moliere's actors from the theater and used it for performances of operas. Chased from their home, the actors of Moliere moved to a different theater, called La Couteillle, on the modern rue Jacques-Callot, where they merged with their old rivals, the company of the H√¥tel de Bourgogne. In 1680, the new company was officially chartered by the King as the Com√©diens de Roi, which became known as the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise. In 1689, they were forced to depart because of complaints that the actors were a bad influence on the neighboring noble students of the Coll√®ge des Quatre-Nations. They moved further south on the left bank to the modern rue de l'Ancienne-Com√©die, where they remained until 1770, before moving back to their present home at the Palais-Royal between 1786 and 1790. Music and opera Music played an important part at the royal court and in Paris society. Louis XIII, the Queen, nobles and wealthy bourgeois organized concerts and recitals and took music lessons. Cardinals Richelieu and Mazarin encouraged the development of French music in place of the Italian style. Music was also seen as an important weapon of the Counter-Reformation, along with baroque art, to win ordinary people to the side of the Catholic Church. The churches were equipped with magnificent organs, and elegant new music was written by the harpsichordist Jacques Champion de Chambonni√®res and the Couperin family. Under Louis XIV, the court in Versailles gradually took charge of the musical program; Jean-Baptiste Lully was invited from his native Florence and became the court composer, the dominant figure in music in both Versailles and Paris. The first performance of an Italian opera in Paris, La Finta Pazza by Marco Marazzoli, took place at the theater of the Palais-Royal on February 28, 1645, followed in 1647 by the more famous Orfeo of Luigi Rossi at the Petit-Bourbon theater next to the Louvre. The first French opera, Le Triomphe de l'Amour by Beys and Laguerre, was performed at the theater du Marais. In 1669, Pierre Perrin, an opera composer, was chartered by the King to produce operas \\"in music and in French verse comparable to that of Italy.\\" The first opera house was built by Perrin in the Marais, on the site of the old tennis court on the modern rue Jacques-Callot. It opened in 1670. Perrin's rival, the court composer Lully, wanted his own opera house; in 1672 he used a tennis court on the rue de Vaugirard for his first opera; then, taking advantage of Moliere's death in 1673, he was able to expel Moliere's actors from the theater of the Palais-Royal and take it over for himself. It served as the main Paris opera house until it burned on April 6, 1763. The Petit- Bourbon theater next to the Louvre also continued to present operas until it was demolished in 1660 to make room for the new colonnade of the Louvre, but it was replaced by a large new hall, the Salle des Machines, next to the Tuileries Gardens. This hall had very poor acoustics, but it was used for spectacular dance performances. Ballet Dance had been popular at the French court since the Middle Ages, but ballet was not given a formal status until March 30, 1661, with the founding of the Acad√©mie royale de danse. The first French comedy-ballet, Les F√¢cheux, was a collaboration between Moliere, Beauchamp and the composer Lully; it was performed on August 17, 1661. In 1669, the ballet academy was formally merged into the Royal Academy of Music and became part of the opera. The first opera-ballet in Paris, L'Europe galante, with music by Campra and choreography by Louis P√©cour, was performed in 1697. Architecture The Church of St-Gervais-et-St-Protais, the first Paris church with a facade in the new Baroque style (1616-1620) The architectural style of the French Renaissance continued to dominate in Paris through the Regency of Marie de' Medici. The end of the wars of religion allowed the continuation of several building projects, such as the expansion of the Louvre, begun in the 16th century but abandoned because of the war. With the arrival in power of Louis XIII and the ministers Richelieu and Mazarin, a new architectural style, the baroque, imported from Italy, began to appear in Paris. Its purpose, like Baroque music and painting, was to awe Parisians with its majesty and ornament, in opposition to the austere style of the Protestant Reformation. The new style in Paris was characterized by opulence, irregularity, and an abundance of decoration. The straight geometric lines of the buildings were covered with curved or triangular frontons, niches with statues or cariatides, cartouches, garlands of drapery, and cascades of fruit carved from stone. The Church of Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis (1634) At about the same time that the ornate baroque style appeared, the architect Salomon de Brosse (1571-1626) introduced a new classical French style, based on the traditional orders of architecture (Doric, Ionic and Corinthian), placed one above the other. He first used this style in the facade of the Church of St- Gervais-et-St-Protais (1616-1620) The style of the three superimposed orders appeared again in the Eglise Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis, the new Jesuit church in Paris, designed by the Jesuit architects Etienne Martellange and Fran√ßois Derand. Another type of church facade appeared in the same period, imitating the church of the Jesuits in Rome built in 1568. This facade had two levels; the lower level was the height of the chapels, while the upper level featured a high fronton above the doors. The two levels were connected with s-shaped volutes and consoles, and the whole facade was covered with niches and other decorative elements. Inside the church was rectangular with a high vaulted ceiling, with chapels on both sides. This style of church usually had a dome, the symbol of the ideal in Renaissance architecture. This style was used by Jacques Lemercier for the chapel of the Sorbonne (1635-1642), and by Fran√ßois Mansart for the church of the Val-de-Grace, built for Anne of Austria, the widow of Louis XIII. It was part of a large complex modeled after the Escorial in Spain, which combined a church, a convent, and apartments for the Queen. The new architectural style was sometimes called Flamboyant Gothic or French baroque. It appeared in several other new churches, including Notre-Dame de Bonne-Nouvelle (1624, damaged and then demolished after the Revolution), Notre-Dame-des-Victoires (1629), Saint-Sulpice (1646), and Saint-Roch (1653). The Pavillon de la Reine of Place des Vosges Civil architecture of the period was particularly characterized by red brick alternating with white stone around the windows and doors, and marking the different stories, and by a high roof of black slate. The high roof, particularly used by Mansart, allowed an extra floor of habitation, became known as a Mansart roof. Notable civil buildings of the period include the Pavillon de Horloge of the Louvre by Jacques Lemercier (1620-1624), the Luxembourg Palace by Salomon de Brosse (begun 1615), and the houses around the Place des Vosges. The palatial new residences built by the nobility in the Marais featured two new and original specialized rooms; the dining room and the salon. The new residences typically were separated from the street by a wall and gatehouse. There was a large court of honor inside the gates, with galleries on either side, used for receptions, and for services and the stables. The house itself opened both onto the courtyard and onto a separate garden. One good example in its original form is the H√¥tel de Sully, (1624-1629), built by Jean Androuret du Cerceau. The Church of Les Invalides, by Jules Hardouin-Mansart (1679-1691) Under Louis XIV, the architectural style in Paris gradually changed from the exuberance of the baroque to a more solemn and formal classicism, the embodiment in stone of the King's vision of Paris as \\"the new Rome.\\" The new Academy of Architecture, founded in 1671, imposed an official style, as the academies of art and literature had done earlier. The style was modified again beginning in about 1690, as the government began to run short of money; new projects were less grandiose. In religious architecture, the rectangular shape of churches was replaced by that of a Greek cross, with the dome at the center. The different classical orders were on display one above the other on the facade, but the dome, gilded and sculpted, rather than the facade, was the principal decorative feature. The grandest example was Church of Les Invalides (1679-1691), by Jules Hardouin-Mansart. Perrault's colonnade of the Louvre (1670), in the monumental classic style of Louis XIV The most important project in civil architecture was the new colonnade of the Louvre (1670). The King rejected a design presented by the Italian architect Bernini and chose instead a design by Claude Perrault, brother of Charles Perrault, author of the fairy tales Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella. Perrault's long facade had a flat roof concealed by a balustrade and a series of massive columns and triangular fronts, designed to convey elegance and power. Two other major projects, the facades of the buildings around the Place des Victoires (1685-1686) and Place Louis-le-Grand (now Place Vend√¥me) (1687-1700) echoed the same message. Painting and sculpture Model of a statue of Louis XIV by Fran√ßois Girardon for Place Louis-Le-Grand At the beginning of the 17th century, painters in Paris were considered primarily as artisans, not as artists. Like other artisans, they had their own professional guild, the imagiers-paintres, which also included engravers, illuminators and sculptors. Under the guild rules approved by the Provost of Paris in 1391, and renewed in 1619, they were required to use good-quality paint, and they were protected against foreign competition; it was expressly forbidden to import works of art from Flanders, Germany or elsewhere in Europe except during the period of the Fair of Saint-Germain and other major trade fairs. It was also forbidden by a 1639 ordinance to paint portraits of nude men or women with \\"postures lascivious and dishonest, and other grotesques which injure their chastity.\\" Beginning in 1609, the Louvre Galerie was created, where painters, sculptors, and artisans lived and established their workshops. Under Louis XIV, with many new commissions for the palace in Versailles and the town houses of the nobility in Paris, the profession grew. The number of masters in the guild increased from 275 in 1672 to 552 in 1697. In addition to the guild, in 1391 the majority of painters belonged to the Acad√©mie de Saint-Luc, a professional and fraternal association. In 1648, many of the most successful and ambitious painters and sculptors, who wanted recognition as artists and not simply craftsmen, joined together to found another group, the Acad√©mie de peinture et de sculpture. In 1667, the Acad√©mie organized its first official exposition of works of art of its members. These exhibitions were held every two years, opening on August 25, the day of Saint-Louis. They were first held in the court of the Palais-Royal, then in the Grand Gallery of the Louvre, and then, beginning in 1699, in the Salon Carr√© of the Louvre, which gave the event the name \\"Salon\\". It became the chief avenue for French artists to achieve recognition and success. The most famous painter to work in Paris during the period was Peter Paul Rubens, who came to the city in 1622 to paint a series of murals for the Luxembourg Palace which now are in the Louvre. Other painters who achieved fame in Paris early in the century were Claude Vignon, Nicolas Poussin, Philippe de Champagne, Simon Vouet, and Eustache Le Sueur. The leading painters working in Paris and in Versailles during the reign of Louis XIV included Charles Le Brun, Nicolas de Largilliere, Pierre Mignard, Hyacinthe Rigaud and Antoine Watteau. The most important sculptors in the early century were Fran√ßois and Michel Anguier, who led the transition from Baroque sculpture to classicism. The major figures under Louis XIV were Girardon, a pupil of Anguier, and Antoine Coysevox. Girardon created a monumental statue of Louis XIV on horseback for the center of Place Louis-la- Grand (now Place Vend√¥me). The statue was pulled down and destroyed during the Revolution, but the original model is on display in the Louvre. Coysevox made a heroic statue of Louis XIV as Fame for the Chateau of Marly (now in the Tuileries Gardens)) and the majestic funeral monuments for Colbert (now in the church of Saint-Eustache); for Andre le N√¥tre and Racine (in the Church of Saint-Roch) and for Cardinal Mazarin (in the Louvre).

Origins The Restored Taungoo Dynasty saw the establishment of a state administration system involving two major administrative bodies, the Hluttaw, and the Byedaik, that was left unchanged until the demise of the Konbaung dynasty in 1885. Etymology The word bye stems from Mon blai (), meaning \\"bachelor.\\" Composition During the Konbaung dynasty, the Byedaik consisted of: *Eight Atwinwun (, c.f. 'Ministers of the Interior')- communicated business affairs of the Hluttaw to the king, administered internal transactions of general affairs relating to the royal court. *Thandawzin (, \\"Heralds\\") - performed secretarial duties and attended king's audiences to note king's orders and forward them to Hluttaw for inscription. *Simihtunhmu (, lit. \\"Lamp Lighters\\") - kept a list of all persons sleeping in the palace *Hteindeinyanhmu (, \\"caretakers of royal appointments\\") - performed menial tasks such as maintaining the palace furniture, draperies and other appointments Responsibilities The Byedaik maintained the inner affairs of the royal court, whereas the Hluttaw was responsible for state affairs, including fiscal, executive, and judicial responsibilities and managed the kingdom's government. The Byedaik relayed and facilitated communication between the monarch and the Hluttaw, and filtered information that was relayed from the Hluttaw. This gave the Byedaik immense influence in the court, as they were able to censor communications and formulate edicts returned to the Hluttaw, and serve as confidential advisors to the monarch. The Byedaik also supervised military security in the palace's royal living quarters. The Byedaik's influence created constant tensions with the Hluttaw, especially during coup attempts.

Gunther's pathbreaking casebook, Constitutional Law, originally published in 1965 and now in its 17th edition (co-edited with Kathleen Sullivan), is the most widely used constitutional law textbook in American law schools.Nolte, Carl. \\"Gerald Gunther -- law professor, author\\". SFGate. 2 August 2002. Retrieved 28 June 2015. Early life and education Gerald Gunther was born on May 26, 1927, in Usingen im Taunus, Germany, where his family had worked as butchers for over three centuries. Gunther entered primary school during the same year in which Adolf Hitler gained power. In school, Gunther experienced virulent anti-Semitism; a Nazi schoolteacher labeled Gunther \\"Jew-pig\\" and segregated him from his classmates.Casper, Gerhard. \\"Gerald Gunther\\".

He then received an M.A. in public law and government from Columbia University in 1950 and an LL.B., magna cum laude, from Harvard Law School in 1953, where he was an editor of the Harvard Law Review. Career From 1953 to 1954, following his graduation from Harvard, Gunther clerked for Judge Learned Hand of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and from 1954 to 1955, for Chief Justice Earl Warren of the United States Supreme Court. As later revealed by Warren, Gunther played a central role in the writing of the Court's landmark ruling in Brown v. Board of Education (II). After a year in private practice at a Wall Street law firm, Gunther joined the faculty of Columbia Law School in 1956. At Columbia, Gunther mentored future Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who graduated from Columbia Law School in 1959. According to Ginsburg, Gunther helped to secure her clerkship with Judge Edmund L. Palmieri of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York \\"by pressuring every judge in the Southern District\\" to hire her. Gunther also advised Ginsburg on how to broaden constitutional protections to women when she was a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, and in July 1993, Gunther testified for Ginsburg at her Senate confirmation hearings. In 1962, Gunther left Columbia for Stanford Law School, where he became the William Nelson Cromwell Professor of Law in 1972, taking emeritus status in 1995 (though he continued to teach until his death). At Stanford, Gunther, who was motivated by his childhood experiences in Nazi Germany, became an outspoken defender of civil liberties, particularly the right to freedom of speech.Luna, Claire. \\"Gerald Gunther, 75; Stanford Law Lecturer, Scholar\\" Los Angeles Times. 2 August 2002. Retrieved 28 June 2015. In 1976, Gunther famously defended the freedom of speech rights of American Nazis, and in 1988, Gunther opposed a Stanford University ban on expressions of racial or religious intolerance. Recalling his own experiences with anti-Semitism, Gunther spoke of \\"the need to walk the sometimes difficult path of denouncing the bigot‚Äôs hateful ideas with all my power, yet at the same time challenging any community‚Äôs attempt to suppress hateful ideas by force of law.\\" In addition to his prolific scholarship on constitutional law, first amendment law, and the U.S. Supreme Court, Gunther spent 22 years researching and writing his influential 818-page biography of Judge Learned Hand, titled Learned Hand: The Man and the Judge. Gunther's biography earned him numerous awards, including the Triennial Book Award of the Order of the Coif and the Erwin N. Griswold Triennial Prize from the Supreme Court Historical Society. Gunther was ultimately awarded five honorary degrees, as well as the Learned Hand Medal for Excellence in Federal Jurisprudence from the Federal Bar Council in 1988, the Richard J. Maloney Prize for Distinguished Contributions to Legal Education from the Order of the Coif in 1990, and the Bernard E. Witkin Medal from the State Bar of California in 1995. In 1987, in a survey of lawyers conducted by the National Law Journal, Gunther was voted as the most qualified candidate for the United States Supreme Court.

The various metro rail proposals of 2008‚Äì10, which involved lines running west from the CBD towards Rozelle and the northern suburbs, would have included a station between Wynyard and Barangaroo. These proposals were shelved in 2010, however. The government also considered a light rail line from Central to Barangaroo via Sussex Street and Hickson Road, but nothing came of this proposal. With the first buildings at Barangaroo opening in 2015 and no mass transit construction imminent, Transport for NSW instead began work on the Wynyard Walk: a pedestrian tunnel to connect Wynyard station and the new precinct. The walkway was opened in September 2016. In 2015, Premier Mike Baird announced the government's intention to divert the second harbour rail crossing via Barangaroo to allow a station to be built there.

It appeared as an episode of the anthology series The General Motors Hour. The play had just completed a 12-week run in Melbourne. Australian TV drama was relatively rare at the time. Premise In 1890s Melbourne, a young man murders a blackmailer in a hansom cab. The murdered kills three more people then romances an heiress. Cast *Barry Pree as the innocent man wrongly accused of the crime *Fred Parslow as the villain *Leon Lissek *Elaine Cusik *Joan Harris *Mary Hardy as Salvation Army Girl *Robert Hornery as her boyfriend *Patsy King *Bryan Edward *Marion Edward *Ron Finney *Graeme Hughes *Malcolm Phillips 1961 Play Version Ad for show in The Age 7 Apr 1961 Actor-writer Barry Pree, then 22 years of age, had adapted the novel into a stage play. It was the first commissioned play for the Union Theatre Repertory Company, later the Melbourne Theatre Company by its first writer in residence.https://variety.com/2003/legit/news/oz-s-golden-age-1117892067/ (He did this on the basis of his play A Fox in the Night written when he was 19.) John Sumner had suggested Pree adapt the novel, which had been hugely popular in its day but had not been revived for a number of years. Pree took a farcical approach to the material, turning it into a spoof of old time melodramas. The original directors were John Sumner and George Ogilvie. It debuted at the Union Theatre in Parkville on 9 January 1961 and ran until 4 February. The cast were headed by Lewis Fiander (hero), Frederick Parslow (Villain) and Patsy King. The Age called it a triumph for all concerned... rollicking good fun and entertainment.\\" Another review in the same paper called it \\"unqualifiedly good entertainment.\\" The Bulletin said \\"most audiences will enjoy Pree's joke.\\" The play then had a run at Russell Street Theatre from March until May. The stage play was very popular with audiences. The cast included Fred Parslow, Joan Harris and Mary Hardy, who had been in many Melbourne musicals, including Free as Air, Salad Days and Auntie Mamie. TV Version The TV adaptation was basically a filmed version of the stage performance. It was filmed at the Russell St Theatre Melbourne and included the reactions of the audience applauding the hero and booing and throwing peanuts at the villain, with occasional cutaways to a pianist playing \\"mood music\\". Two songs of the era, \\"Daisy\\" and \\"Lily of the Laguna\\" were played. It took 24 hours to move the recording equipment from the studio to the theatre. The Sydney Morning Herald said Barry Pree played \\"a personably virtuous hero with a variable Irish accent, cheerfully mixed top-hatted histrionics with music-hall singing and dancing, a barrow-load of deliberate anachronisms, and some mockery of modern Melbourne in the style of intimate revue.\\" Songs *\\"Come to the Garden Maud\\" *\\"Daisy\\" *\\"Lily of the Laguna\\" Reception The TV critic for the Sydney Morning Herald called it \\"an interesting experiment... only partially successful in terms of the special techniques of television. There were too many long-distance shots, of doll-like .figures on stage; not enough of the searching intimacy of expression on which television thrives.\\" The Australian Woman's Weekly said \\"As is fashionable with such melodramas nowadays, the audience was invited to throw peanuts at the villain. It could have done without the topicality and the peanuts. The audience, carried away, apparently, by being on TV, showered the cast indiscriminately with peanuts to the point of being irritating.\\" The novel was adapted for Australian radio later in 1961.

History Victoria Hospital in Swindon was established in 1887, at first with 12 beds, increasing to 22 by 1904; it finally closed in 2007. From 1947 to 1974, NHS services in Wiltshire were managed by the South-West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board (covering New Sarum, Wilton, and the rural districts of Amesbury, Mere and Tisbury, and Salisbury and Wilton), by the South-Western Board (responsible for the Lyme Regis area) and by Oxford Regional Hospital Board (Marlborough and Swindon). In 1965 a new board was formed for Wessex which covered the boroughs of New Sarum and Wilton and the rural districts of Amesbury, Mere and Tisbury, and Salisbury and Wilton. In 1974 the boards were abolished and replaced by regional health authorities, with the whole of Wiltshire coming under the Wessex RHA. Regions were reorganised in 1996 and Dorset came under the South and West Regional Health Authority. Wiltshire had three area health authorities: Wiltshire, Salisbury and Swindon, from 1974 until 1994 when it was united into one authority for Bath and Wiltshire. Regional health authorities were reorganised and renamed strategic health authorities in 2002; Wiltshire was part of Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire SHA. In 2006 regions were again reorganised and Wiltshire came under NHS South West until that was abolished in 2013. There was one primary care trust for the county. Bath, Swindon and Wiltshire formed a sustainability and transformation plan area in March 2016, chaired since December 2019 by Stephanie Elsy, a former leader of Southwark Council. Commissioning Bath and North East Somerset, Swindon and Wiltshire CCG was formed in April 2020 by merging three CCGs which covered Bath and North East Somerset, Swindon and Wiltshire. At that time the combined CCG had an annual budget of ¬£1.3 billion and served a population of 934,000 across an area of . The CCG's headquarters are in Chippenham and it has offices in Bath, Devizes and Swindon. Its chief executive is Tracey Cox, formerly a manager at Bath and North East Somerset Primary Care Trust and then the corresponding CCG. Swindon CCG agreed in June 2015 to fund a community therapy team at the Prospect Hospice, providing occupational and physiotherapy at home, in order to reduce pressure on hospital beds. Wiltshire CCG expected a ¬£23 million funding gap in 2016/17 and to miss its financial target by ¬£4.8m in 2015/6. Consequently it capped the amount of planned care delivered in hospitals, limited the number of funded procedures, and recovered money from drug companies. Primary care , there are 22 GP practices in Swindon and 49 in Wiltshire; the CCG's 94 practices are grouped into 23 primary care networks. Out-of-hours services are provided by Medvivo. Community care Community child health services, including children‚Äôs specialist community nursing, health visiting and speech and language therapy, have been run by Virgin Care since April 2016. They were formerly run by five separate NHS organisations. Swindon Council and Swindon Clinical Commissioning Group set up a contract with SEQOL, a newly formed community interest company, to provide a variety of adult social care services in 2011. The council paid ¬£9.4 million and the CCG ¬£17 million a year. In March 2016, they decided not to renew the contract because of performance problems: in 2014-15 the average daily rate, per 100,000 population, of delayed hospital discharges from hospital attributable to social care was 6.9 in Swindon, compared to a national average of 3.7. SEQOL requested to end their involvement without completing the 12 months' notice provided in the contract, and from October 2016, Great Western Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust were responsible for these services. SEQOL's staff returned to employment by the hospital or the council, and the company intended to cease trading. Mental health Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust (AWP) provides adult mental health and related services in Wiltshire and the former county of Avon, an area centered on Bristol. From April 2010, Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust has provided tiers 3 and 4 of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) in Wiltshire and Bath and North East Somerset following a competitive tender. Previously this service had been operated by three providers, though primarily AWP. The service is jointly funded by the NHS and local authorities. Hospital provision Great Western Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust are the main acute providers in the county. In June 2018 they agreed to form an alliance with Royal United Hospitals Bath NHS Foundation Trust, as they provide most of the hospital services in the Bath, North East Somerset, Swindon and Wiltshire sustainability and transformation plan area. Community hospitals at Chippenham, Devizes, Melksham, Marlborough (Savernake), Trowbridge and Warminster are run since 2016 by Wiltshire Health and Care LLP.

It is held annually in September to honor Queen Oronsen, a mythical wife of Rerengejen. During the festival, the incumbent Olowo of Owo and high chiefs of Owo Kingdom dress like women with coral beads, beaded gowns and plaited hair. Wearing of headgears and caps as well as beating of drums and firing of guns are not allowed during the festival. History The Igogo festival began over 600 years ago during the reign of Olowo Rerengejen. The monarch married Oronsen, a beautiful and affluent queen who was, unknown to the king, an orisha. She enriched the monarch and she was loved by him as a result. Queen Oronsen insisted on certain taboos. She insisted that nobody should grind okra in her presence or pour water into the yard. In addition, anyone arriving from the farm must not lump a load of firewood. King Rerengejen cautioned his other wives not to carry out any of these activities. One day, Queen Oronsen had a disagreement with the other wives of the King. They conspired against her with the intention of violating her taboos while Rerengejen was not in the palace. Her taboos were duly violated and she subsequently left the palace. While she was running out of the palace, some palace guards and chiefs ran after her to bring her back, an effort that proved futile. She later felt tired and waited at a place called \\"Ugbo Laja\\" where she was found and persuaded to return to the palace. Her refusal frustrated the guards, who forcefully captured her thereafter but she disappeared into \\"Igbo Oluwa\\", now a sacred forest, leaving her head ties (oja) at Ugbo Laja. The guards later returned them to King Rerengejen. \\"Ugbo Laja\\" is now a sacred grove. Queen Oronsen's terra cotta sculptured image from \\"Igbo Oluwa\\" by Ekpo Eyo stood at a distance to inform the Owo people that nothing will bring her back to the palace but that annually they should always sacrifice two hundred items of different articles, such as dried fish, colanut, aligator pepper, bitter cola and many more for ritual (Igogo) and in return she promised to protect the kingdom forever. Events Igogo festival lasts for 17 days and begins with Upeli proceedings by the Iloro chiefs. The chiefs are led by a chief known as Akowa of Iloro, who is the traditional head of the Iloro chiefs. This Upeli procession lasts for 12 days and features several activities including Utegi, Ugbabo, Uyanna and Ugbate. It is also a period for the celebration of new yams.Poynor, Robin (1987). Ako Figures of Owo and Second Burials in Southern Nigeria. Coleman African Studies Center. p. 86. During this procession, beating of drums by individuals or associations is forbidden and the use of caps by men and head ties by women at close range to the Owo monarch, the Olowo of Owo, is also prohibited. The festival features the dance of bare-chested men, the Iloro Quarter men called Ighares. They often wear white caps with two horns of buffalo in their hands. They strike these horns together while dancing around the town and visiting some sacred places in the town. During this rite, any animal that crosses their paths automatically becomes food for them. The chiefs plait their hair and dance round the town, and visit their loved ones who give them gifts in return. The monarch often dresses like a woman and dances round the town as well. Dancing in the market by the monarch is also one of the rites performed during the festival.

The School attempted to widen officers' outlook by including in its syllabus subjects that were not immediately military but led to an appreciation of the wider political, geographical and technological environment in which the Army would operate. The first commandant was Brigadier-General Henry Edward ap Rhys Pryce, who was appointed in December 1920, and the last commandant was Brigadier William Slim, who was appointed in June 1939, shortly before the school closed in September, due to the outbreak of the Second World War in Europe. There was also a parallel establishment, the Senior Officers' School, Sheerness, at Sheerness in England. Commandants The following officers commanded the school during its existence: * Brigadier-General Henry E. ap R. Pryce: December 1920-August 1924 * Brigadier-General H.B.

It is popular as a freshwater aquarium species across Asia, Europe, and North America.Chucholl, C. (2013). Invaders for sale: trade and determinants of introduction of ornamental freshwater crayfish. Biological invasions, 15(1), 125-141.Patoka, J., Kalous, L., & Kopeck√Ω, O. (2015). Imports of ornamental crayfish: the first decade from the Czech Republic‚Äôs perspective. Knowledge and Management of Aquatic Ecosystems, (416), 04. Etymology The specific name is derived from the Latin word pulcher, which means \\"beautiful\\". The name was chosen due to the species' bright coloration. Discovery The species was first observed being sold for aquariums, where it was ascertained that it likely represented a new species. However, it proved difficult to track down, as dealers' claims as to its location proved difficult to corroborate. It was eventually traced to the Bird's Head Peninsula in New Guinea, where a number of specimens were collected with the help of the Maju Aquarium in Jakarta. Description Males of the species measure in length, while females measure long. The body is slightly oval in shape. The species has notably large eyes. The species is brightly colored, with a pink cephalothorax that fades into greenish-grey on the sides. The rostrum is a greenish-blue, and the pleon is dark blue or black, with pinkish-grey or cream coloration on the margins (in some individuals the pleon is greenish-grey with pink speckles). The tail fan is cream-colored or pink around the outside margin. The legs are blue, and the chelae are blue with varying intensities, with cream-colored or white margins. Taxonomy C. pulcher is part of the subgenus Astaconephrops. It is the nineteenth Cherax species to have been discovered in West Papua in Indonesia (Cherax are not known from other Indonesian regions). The most morphologically similar species, C. boesemani, is found in the Ajamaru Lake and the Ajamaru River, approximately away. Range and habitat So far the species has only been found in Hoa Creek near the village of Teminabuan in West Papua, Indonesia. The creek is clear, fast flowing in some places, with a sandy and rocky bottom. Human use The species is sold throughout Asia, Europe, and North America on the ornamental fish market, where it is commonly marketed under the names \\"Hoa Creek\\", \\"Blue Moon\\", or \\"Irian Jaya\\". Local people also harvest it as a source of food. Conservation status Due to continued harvesting of the species both for export and for consumption, it has been observed by local collectors that the species' numbers have begun to decrease.

The book is based on police records and observes the events of July 22, 1934 as being a shooting that resulted in the fatal wounding of a double of John Dillinger. The book was published in 1983 by December Press, and involved an expansion and update of Nash's earlier book Dillinger: Dead or Alive. Nash's theory of Dillinger's escape In The Dillinger Dossier, author Jay Robert Nash maintains that Dillinger escaped death at the Biograph Theater simply by not being there. In his stead was a \\"Jimmy Lawrence\\", a local Chicago petty criminal whose appearance was similar to Dillinger's. Nash uses evidence to show that Chicago Police officer Martin Zarkovich was instrumental in this plot. Nash theorizes that the plot unraveled when the body was found to have fingerprints that didn't match Dillinger's (the fingerprint card was missing from the Cook County Morgue for over three decades), it was too tall, the eye color was wrong, and it possessed a rheumatic heart. The F.B.I., a relatively new agency whose agents were only recently permitted to carry guns or make arrests, would have fallen under heavy scrutiny, this being the third innocent man killed in pursuit of Dillinger, and would have gone to great lengths to ensure a cover up. In shooting the Dillinger stand in, F.B.I. agents were stationed on the roof of the theater and fired downward, causing the open cuts on the face which were described through the media as \\"scars resulting from inept plastic surgery\\". The first words from Dillinger's father upon identifying the body were, \\"that's not my boy.\\" The body was buried under five feet of concrete and steel, making exhumation less likely. Nash produced fingerprints and photos of Dillinger as he would appear in 1960 that were allegedly sent to Melvin Purvis just prior to his 1960 alleged suicide (more probably an accident). Nash alleged Dillinger was living and working in California as a machinist, under what would have been an early form of the witness protection program.  Challenging Nash's theory  * Dillinger did indeed have a heart condition according to Dr. Patrick H. Weeks, a physician and psychiatrist at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City during the time of Dillinger's incarceration at the facility. In his 1938 book, The Big House of Mystery, he writes, \\"During his term at the Indiana prison I was well acquainted with Dillinger, but came rarely into contact with him in my professional capacity. The lad from Mooresville was not a hospital pest; that is, he was not one of those prisoners who needs medical treatment upon the slightest provocation whatsoever. I examined him two or three times, however, and discovered something about his physical condition which is quite surprising and which, incidentally, was never revealed in the press. John Dillinger suffered from heart disease. He had a distinct heart lesion. The disease was organic. I told Dillinger that he should never subject himself to great mental or physical strain, because it might hasten his death. I was confident that he would follow my advice.\\"Weeks, Patrick H., M.D., \\"The Big House of Mystery,\\" p. 148-149 * Dillinger's father initially couldn't believe the dead man he was looking at was his son. Neither could his sister, Audrey, when first seeing the body.

It includes illustrations by Nate Taylor and was first published by DAW Books in the United States on October 28, 2014.  Plot introduction  The novella is focused on Auri, a character from The Kingkiller Chronicle and her adventures in the Underthing, a hidden location of old rooms and tunnels under the University. Through the seven days narrated in the book, Auri explores the Underthing, awaiting a visit from Kvothe, a time period that is covered specifically between chapters seven and eleven of The Wise Man's Fear.  Writing and structure  The writing occasionally slips into a poetic flow when describing the little things in Auri's day-to-day life. As Patrick Rothfuss himself says, the book does not do what a \\"proper book should do\\", so that it actually doesn't have a very proper plot. The story cannot clearly be divided into a beginning, middle and end, and does not have a proper climax. While The Kingkiller Chronicle books develop a plot and multiple characters, this novella explores one character, describing the day-to-day life of the protagonist, showing her view of the world and the way her mind works.  Background and publication  In 2012, George R. R. Martin and Gardner Dozois, co-editors of a series of cross-genre anthologies, invited Patrick Rothfuss to be in their anthology called Rogues, which Rothfuss agreed to. He initially planned to contribute a story about Auri, who he thought would make a nice counterpoint to some of the other classic rogue-type characters in the anthology. However, after Rothfuss started writing the story, it exceeded the number of words for the anthology and the story went in a different direction from the rogue theme. He then decided to contribute a story about Bast instead, which ended up being the short story \\"The Lightning Tree\\" and was eventually published in Rogues in June 2014. Afterwards, Rothfuss resumed his work on the third book of the trilogy, The Doors of Stone, but the half- unfinished story about Auri tickled him and eventually he went back to finish it. When he put the finishing touches on the story in February 2013, he came up with the working title The Weight of Her Desire, a phrase that appears in the first and last chapters of the book. Encouraged by feedback from his friend and mathemusician Vi Hart, he presented the story to his agent and then his editor, who were enthusiastic about it. Rothfuss introduced the story to his friend and illustrator Nate Taylor and asked him to create illustrations for the book. Rothfuss was specific about having no explicit pictures of Auri or any of the rooms in the Underthing. It took about two months to finalize the illustrations. The story was eventually published as the standalone novella The Slow Regard of Silent Things in November 2014. The character of Auri was partially inspired by real life tunnel dweller Tunnel Bob from Madison, Wisconsin.  Reception  The book debuted at number two position in the New York Times Best Seller Hardcover Fiction list approximately three weeks after its release. It spent a month on the list before falling out of the top 15. The Slow Regard of Silent Things received positive reviews from critics. Marc Alpin of Fantasy Faction was impressed by the writing of Rothfuss, stating \\"The number of beautiful metaphors, the authenticity of Auri's voice and the emotions that the story evokes are as strong as we'd expect\\". Alister Davison of Starbust Magazine writes: \\"It is wonderfully written, the prose verging on poetic in places... There's a sense that Rothfuss has chosen every one of those words with great care and precision, using them to tell a story that's lyrical, heart-felt and unique.\\"https://www.starburstmagazine.com/reviews/book-reviews-latest- literary-releases/10175-the-slow-regard-of-silent-things  References   External links  Official website of Patrick Rothfuss 2014 American novels American novellas DAW Books books ","title":"The Slow Regard of Silent Things"},{"id":"47100689","title":"List of defunct airlines of Israel"},{"id":"47100690","text":"Felipe Moreira dos Santos (born 28 November 1988 in Rio de Janeiro), commonly known as Felipe Moreira, is a Brazilian footballer who currently plays as a Forward for FK Kuk√´si in the Albanian Superliga.Soccerway profile Career FK Kuk√´si He left Alecrim and Brazil for the first time in his professional career to join Albanian Superliga side FK Kuk√´si ahead of the Europa League first qualifying round.
