Biography Overbeck was born in Antwerp. He was son-in-law to zoologist Georg August Goldfuss (1782-1848), and was father-in-law to anthropologist Emil Ludwig Schmidt (1837-1906). His uncle was famed painter Friedrich Overbeck (1789-1869). In 1848 Overbeck received his Ph.D. from the University of Bonn, where he served as a privatdocent from 1850 to 1853. In 1853 he became an associate professor of archaeology and dean of the archaeological collection at the University of Leipzig. He worked at Leipzig for the remainder of his career, becoming a full professor in 1859. Two of his better known students were Adolf Furtw√§ngler (1853-1907) and Adolf Michaelis (1835-1910). He also helped direct the Archaeological Institute in Berlin (1874-1895). \\"Johannes Overbeck\\" in Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie, Band 55, Leipzig, 1910, S. 852-854. Plan of the Old Baths at Pompeii by Overbeck One of his earliest publications was a significant work on Pompeii that ran to several editions, and in 1884 with August Mau (1840-1909), he published a book about Pompeii and its works of art, titled Pompeji in seinen Geb√§uden, Alterth√ºmern und Kunstwerken. Overbeck was also a specialist of Greek Kunstmythologie (mythological art) within the field of archaeology. He rarely visited archaeological sites, preferring to write about them second hand. This tended to give his writings a dry flavor, which even his comprehensive marshalling and organization of materials could not really overcome. Carl Schurz has noted that ‚Äúit has been said that [Overbeck] wrote the best book that has ever been written on Herculaneum and Pompeii, without ever having seen either spot.‚Äù Overbeck's devotion was mainly to the lecture pulpit, and there he made his most noteworthy contributions. His lectures were very well attended, the primary ones with frequently over 100 listeners. He sought to improve the life of students in other ways as well by establishing a reading room and infirmary. As one compensation for his lack of first-hand experience, he developed Leipzig's collection of plaster casts.

It engaged in espionage. Its existence has only recently been acknowledged. History In the spring of 1942, Brigadier General Hayes Kroner, the head of the War Department's Military Intelligence Service, was given the go-ahead to set up an espionage organization separate from William \\"Wild Bill\\" Donovan's Office of Strategic Services. He selected to head it U.S. Army Captain (Jean) John V. Grombach, who was a rival and previous employee of Donovan.Wild Bill Donovan by Douglas Waller, p. 118 In 1955, The Pond was disbanded by the American government because of post-war centralization of intelligence gathering and questions about the organization's effectiveness. On April 27, 2008, the Associated Press reported that the Central Intelligence Agency planned to \\"release a stash of Pond-related papers accidentally discovered in a Virginia barn in 2001\\" and hand them over to the National Archives at College Park, Maryland.  John Grombach  Jean (John) Valentin Grombach led the Pond in intelligence operations from 1942 to 1955. Grombach was an anti-Communist who had an obsession with secrecy and security. Grombach was born in New Orleans in 1901 to a French family. He was an accomplished athlete who had a love for fencing and boxing, even competing on the United State's Olympic boxing team. He grew to know many important European businessmen from his father's business and shipping involvements, sports promotions, and managing the Olympics. These connections would help to shape his future in international intelligence operations. At the age of 18, Grombach, the son of the French consul, renounced his French citizenship and obtained an American citizenship to attend West Point. Despite having 8 demerits, he graduated with a bachelors of science degree in 1923. He then spent five years on active duty where he had his first involvement in intelligence as assistant G-2. In 1928, Grombach left the army and joined the New York National Guard. After a successful stint working for a subsidiary of CBS and Paramount Publix, Grombach produced his own radio program production companies. He returned to the army in 1941 to work for the Office of the Coordinator of Information. Grombach claims that throughout that time he was secretly working on confidential intelligence projects. In the spring of 1942, Brig. Gen. Hayes Kroner selected Grombach to head the Pond. Grombach was also a writer who authored an article for Infantry Journal titled \\"Kill or Get Killed,\\" and an essay for American Mercury.  Operational Tactics   Focus  The Pond, lead by Grombach, provided the FBI with information on leftist radicals and external influences on the United States. The covert organization's focus developed into the exploitation of communists, especially in America's intelligence institutions.  Secrecy  In order to successfully work, the Pond was extremely small and unknown to most. The team used codewords and cryptic nicknames in all of the Pond's internal records. Grombach never shared the identities of his sources, totaling over 2,500 field personnel from 32 countries. Although the Pond was an Army operation, the existence of the super secret intelligence organization was kept from the Office of Naval Intelligence, and it is not evident if President Truman was aware of its existence. After the end of World War II, Truman decided to shut down the OSS, largely due to Grombach's reports. The extreme secrecy and small size of the Pond are the reasons why it survived after the end of the war. The Pond remained a secret long after its operations ended.  Budget  The War Department initially allocated $150,000 to the Pond per year, and this grew to over $300,000 by the end of World War II. The Pond collaborated with foreign businesses to increase their financial resources.  Methods of Existence  The Pond employed personnel and agent observers from large corporations around the world. The Pond started out as a part of the War Department General Staff but became a private company working under government contract. It transferred jurisdictions many times until operations ceased in 1955.  Operations   List of OSS Soviet Agents  Starting in 1942 as the leader of The Pond, John Grombach worked with a defected Soviet intelligence officer, Alexander Barmine to discover a list of OSS Soviet agents. This was mostly left to the wayside by the United States government because the Soviet Union was now an ally of the United States.  Project 1641  As a study of communist subversion, John Grombach began this project as a comprehensive record of reports eliminated by Alfred McCormack along with identifying two communists that worked for McCormack and several others. The list of supposed communists included: * Alger Hiss * Carl Marzani * John Stewart The monographs called for research into McCormack to be investigated by superiors, but was later set aside as Grombach was accused of discrediting an officer of the Military Intelligence Service along with inappropriately revealing classified information. Although it seemed the end, this was not so. With the abolishment of the OSS by Harry S. Truman, the branch of Research and Analysis was sent to the State Department along with Alfred McCormack, Secretary of State Byrnes. With McCormack as leader of the Interim Research and Intelligence Service, John Grombach would compile the names of 15 G-2 operatives who had moved to the state department along with McCormack and which were previously suspected of disloyalty. Grombach sent these names to the House Committee of Military Affairs where an investigation would begin. Without revealing his name, the Committee made public Grombach's allegations in March 1946, would stir up controversy between McCormack and the Committees chairman, pushing McCormack to resign in April 1946.  Marcel Petiot  As doctor, serial killer, and source for The Pond, Petiot used his occupation as a doctor to gain information from his patients' gossip, and passed that on to John Grombach. Stationed in Paris, Petiot had German Abwehr officers and east Paris refugees as patients. With this information, Petiot identified German Abwehr officers that had been sent to the United States, which were later found by the FBI and some of who were convinced to work for the United States.  Information Transportation  While investigating a lead that suggested German missiles were being produced in Norway and Sweden, The Pond transported its information via diplomacy from London. Grombach suspected that the pouches that British couriers were transporting were being opened, thus submitted an unopened pouch for FBI investigation, confirming that the pouch had been opened and resealed. Because of this, American couriers transported the pouches from there on out.  Hungary  The Pond targeted Hungary both during and after World War II. During the war, they focused on gathering intelligence on battle information and Admiral Horthy's attempts to remove Hungary from the war. After the war in 1946, James McCargar became a case officer for the Pond located in Hungary and focused his reporting on an unavoidable communist takeover. His work led to the exfiltration of 75 anti-communist Hungarian political leaders.  DAHL  Under the sponsorship of the Central Intelligence Agency, The Pond began DAHL as an information assembly in Argentina and Uruguay. John Grombach reported on Uruguayan officials that were communist, but many of the submitted reports were rejected by the CIA as a result of Grombach's unreliable sources and without proof. This may have been the operation that led to the dissolve of The Pond.  Post World War II  Before the end of World War II, John Grombach's executive officer, Charles Stevenson, supported The Pond and it's endeavors and tried to fight for The Pond. After World War II had ended, Hoyt Vandenberg, the Director of Central Intelligence, wanted to consolidate power into the Central Intelligence Group, thus pushing against Stevenson for the closing of The Pond. In April 1947, Grombach feared that The Pond would be discontinued, and decided to reveal the organization and its accomplishments to the public by proving its existence to the New York Times. After what seemed to be a loss for Grombach, in early 1947, late 1948, the State Department began funding The Pond in secret, but at a much lower rate than the War Department had in the past. Under the sponsorship of the State Department The Pond was struggling to maintain its merits and in March 1951 would be revealed and resolved under the Central Intelligence Agency.  The end of The Pond  After the Pond was transferred to the Central Intelligence Agency, John Grombach began to submit phony reports against the superiors and workers that he disliked. These false reports and rumors spread by Grombach led to the CIA not renewing the Pond any further after its contract ended on August 15, 1954. All but two operations had ended by January 1, 1955. The CIA continued these last two operations until April 30, 1955. Because it did not have a congressional and public support system, the Pond was beat out by a larger espionage organization. Ultimately, Grombach's philosophy of extreme secrecy lead the Pond to its demise.

WAFLEX has been used to model this drainage basin to improve transboundary water allocation. WAFLEX is a spreadsheet-based model. It can be used to analyse upstream- downstream interactions, dam management options and water allocation and development options. Structure of the Model WAFLEX is set up as a network, where each cell is river reach, demand node or reservoir. Each cell contains a simple formula to add water flowing into it from adjacent cells, and to subtract any demand connected to that cell. The network is set up twice, in demand mode and in supply mode.Savenije, H.H.G., 1995. Spreadsheets: flexible tools for integrated management of water resources in river basins. In: Modelling and Management of Sustainable Basin-scale Water Resources Systems. IAHS Publications 231, pp. 207‚Äì215. The inputs to WAFLEX are: * river inflow time series - source area of where the model starts * demand node time series, e.g. a settlement water supply * reservoir rule curves and dimensions * time series from gauges for calibration The outputs of WAFLEX are: * time series for specified points on the rivers - these can be calibrated against gauges * time series of abstractions and shortages for each demand node * time series of reservoir levels Code can be readily added to generate the above outputs graphically.

The Chapman family belonged to the higher level of the Anglo-Irish landowning class and for generations its members had married into families of a similar standing in England and Ireland. Debrett's Baronetage for 1918 says: Life As a younger son, it was expected that Chapman would run, rather than own, the family's estates, and from 1866 to 1868 he learnt about estate management at the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester. However, his elder brother, William Eden Chapman (born 1844), an officer in the 15th Hussars, died in May 1870, leaving Chapman as the heir. The third brother, Francis Vansittart Chapman, was then trained to manage the estates. Sarah Lawrence On 24 July 1873, Chapman married Edith Sarah Hamilton (b ca 1847), daughter of George Augustus Rochfort-Boyd, JP, DL, of Middleton Park, County Westmeath,George Augustus Rochfort-Boyd was the son of Jane (nee Mackay), Countess of Belvedere (widow of George Rochfort, 2nd Earl of Belvedere; she died 1836) by her 2nd husband. The 2nd (and last) Earl of Belvedere (d 1814) left his unsettled (unentailed) estates to his widow, not his nephew the 3rd Earl of Lanesborough or a younger nephew. Jane, Countess of Belvedere, now a great Irish heiress, married her first husband's barrister Abraham Boyd KC (1760‚Äì1822)in December 1815, and had an only son who inherited the estates on her death 1836. The son changed his name by Royal Licence 16 November 1867 from George Augustus Boyd to George Augustus Rochfort-Boyd. and they had four daughters, Eva Jane Louisa (born 1874), Rose Isabel (born 1878), Florence Livia (born 1880) and Mabel Cecele (born 1881). In the late 1870s, the Chapmans took on as a governess a capable and cheerful young woman known as Sarah Lawrence. By this time, Edith Chapman had become zealously religious, subjecting members of her household to frequent prayer meetings and disapproving of many of their pleasures, while Chapman himself had become a heavy drinker. He fell in love with Sarah Lawrence, who was younger than him by some fifteen years. One of Chapman's daughters later recalled that her father usually had a dour manner, but whenever Sarah Lawrence entered a room, he became \\"all gay\\".Florence, Ronald, Lawrence and Aaronsohn: T.E. Lawrence, Aaron Aaronsohn, and the Seeds of the Arab-Israeli Conflict (Viking, 2007, ) p. 54 Lawrence, who had been born on 31 August 1861 in Sunderland, County Durham, had been registered at birth under the surname of her unmarried mother, Elizabeth Junner, who at the time was working as a servant in the house of Thomas Lawrence, a Lloyd's surveyor, and his son John Lawrence is thought to have been Sarah Lawrence's father. In 1885, Lawrence became pregnant. She went to live in rooms in Dublin which Chapman got for her, and in December 1885 a son was born and christened Montagu Robert. Chapman stayed with his wife, while seeing Lawrence and his son, until Edith Chapman found out what had happened (the Chapmans' butler, while in a Dublin grocer's shop, heard a young woman give her name as Mrs Thomas Chapman ‚Äì he recognised the woman as Sarah Lawrence). He then left his wife to live with Lawrence. He took her to live at Tremadog, Carnarvonshire (now Gwynedd), North Wales, and their second illegitimate son, christened Thomas Edward and later known as 'Lawrence of Arabia', was born there in August 1888. The Lawrence family lived at 2, Polstead Road, Oxford from 1896 to 1921 T. E. Lawrence The couple stayed only a short time in Tremadog, and soon moved on, to Kirkcudbright in the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright in Scotland, then to Dinard in Brittany, the Isle of Wight, and the New Forest, choosing places where their English neighbours were unlikely to recognise him. They had nine children altogether, but three of them died young, leaving five sons and a daughter who survived infancy. In 1896, still unmarried and going under the name of Mr and Mrs Lawrence, the couple arrived in Polstead Road, Oxford.Florence, op. cit., p. 55 The purpose of this move was largely to enable them to educate their sons, despite limited means.Mack, John E., A Prince of Our Disorder: The Life of T. E. Lawrence (Boston: Little, Brown, 1976, ) Chapman lived a life of leisure and spent much of his time with his sons. He was a photographer, hunted, spoke good French, was interested in medieval architecture, taught his sons carpentry, and even in old age would quote from Homer and Horace. He bought smart new bicycles and liked to cycle long distances.Florence, op. cit., p. 56 In 1914, Chapman succeeded his cousin Sir Benjamin Rupert Chapman, 6th Baronet (1865‚Äì1914), to the baronetcy. He died on 8 April 1919 in Oxford and was buried at Wolvercote Cemetery.Sir Thomas Robert Tighe Chapman at findagrave.com, accessed 17 August 2008 As he left no legitimate male heirs, the Chapman Baronetcy of Killua Castle became extinct. Chapman's son T. E. Lawrence had already become world- famous, following the Arab Revolt of 1916. Another of his surviving sons, A. W. Lawrence (1900‚Äì1991) became notable as an archaeologist and art historian. Money affairs in exile On 30 March 1888, Chapman assigned his life interest in his father's estates to his younger brother Francis Chapman, in exchange for a life annuity of ¬£200. Their father, William Chapman, died in 1889, leaving the bulk of his property to his son Francis. However, Chapman also had (or later inherited) some capital, which by 1916 was more than ¬£20,000, producing at the time an annual income of some ¬£1,000, a substantial figure. Chapman (otherwise Mr Lawrence) was probably disappointed when his brother Francis died unmarried in 1915, leaving him only ¬£25,000 of his estate of ¬£120,296, with ¬£10,000 going to the Adelaide Hospital in Dublin and ¬£25,000 being shared by Chapman's legitimate offspring, his four daughters, who were also the residuary legatees. When Chapman (Lawrence) received the ¬£25,000, he shared part of it out among his sons. Chapman had a sister, Caroline Margaret Chapman, who in 1894 married her cousin, Montagu Chapman, later the fifth Chapman baronet, and Sir Montagu died childless in 1907.Ruvigny & Raineval, Marquis of, The Plantagenet Roll of the Blood Royal, Mortimer-Percy Volume, p. 278 online at books.google.co.uk, accessed 25 August 2008 In 1911, his widow made a will which divided the Killua estate, leaving ¬£20,000 to her brother, Chapman, and separate large amounts to his four daughters. However, when she died in 1920, the ¬£20,000 went to the daughters, as her residuary legatees, as Chapman had himself died a few months before and she had not specified that the bequest was to go elsewhere in that event. The loss of the ¬£20,000 may explain the bitterness of an allusion to the Chapmans which T. E. Lawrence added to Liddell Hart's biography of him: \\"The father's family seemed unconscious of his sons, even when after his death recognition of their achievement might have done honour to the name.\\" What was left of the family's land in Ireland was sold in 1949 and then came to some .

He was the third son of Bernhard I, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg, by his wife Princess Sophie, daughter of King Abel of Denmark. Life After the death of his father in 1287, Bernhard inherited the principality of Anhalt-Bernburg. In accordance with the family law of the House of Ascania, he was obliged to rule jointly with his older brother John I without division of their patrimony. John died four years later (1291) and Bernhard became the sole ruler. In the year 1300 Bernhard adopted the title \\"Count of Bernburg\\". His princely title was confirmed the next year. After the Anhalt-Aschersleben line became extinct in 1315, Bernhard inherited the senior princely title of Ascania as well as the title prince of Anhalt-Aschersleben. However, he could not take actual possession of his cousin Otto's lands Anhalt-Aschersleben or retain title to this fief, because the territory was lawfully expropriated by the Bishopric of Halberstadt as payment for the debts of the late Prince Otto. Bernhard agreed to this arrangement in writing in 1316, however his descendants continued to dispute the loss of the principality for centuries.

Two years later, in 1951, he began manufacturing kitchen furniture. His first product was a sideboard with hand-sewn curtains.Finsterwalder, Frauke: The emancipator of the credenza. In: Welt am Sonntag. Stil. Axel Springer SE. 23.01.2005. In 1963, Martin Bulthaup built a factory in Bodenkirchen, followed by a further production facility in Neumarkt-Sankt Veit in 1966.

It enabled flexible kitchen designs, based on a 12 x 12 cm grid.Kietzmann, Norman: When the workbench conquered the kitchen. Berlin: Bau Netz Media GmbH. 2 June 2008. p. 1‚Äì3. (Reviewed: 21 May 2014.) Following Martin Bulthaup's death in 1978, his son Gerd Bulthaup took on the reins of the company. He built a new production facility in Aich, uniting various business departments and corporate functions. Gerd, in seeking to expand the business, came into contact with the designer Otl Aicher, whose design ideas were largely based on the principles of the Ulm School of Design which favours simplified forms and functionality.company website (English)  Collaboration with Otl Aicher  1980 marked the beginning of Bulthaup‚Äôs collaboration with designer Otl Aicher. It was Aicher‚Äôs belief that the kitchen should be an inviting place where meals are prepared together; where all the required tools and implements are clearly visible, and stored within easy reach. In 1982, Aicher published his book Die K√ºche zum Kochen (The Kitchen is for Cooking).Otl Aicher: Die K√ºche zum Kochen (The Kitchen is for Cooking). Callwey Verlag, Munich 1982, This same year Bulthaup launched its System b kitchens, inspired by Aicher‚Äôs research. In 1988, the Bulthaup Kitchen Workbench (KWB) followed, combining a stainless steel cooktop, sink and worktop. The workbench brought design elements typical of professional kitchens into the private setting, and went on to win multiple awards. 1990s  Bulthaup System 25 with Bulthaup exhaust hood und Duktus furniture (1992) Bulthaup System 20 (1997) 1992 was the year of Bulthaup‚Äôs System 25.

From 2000  In 2002, Gerd Bulthaup retired from the day-to-day running of the business. The company went on to be headed up by several external managers before returning to the family in 2010, under the leadership of Marc O. Eckert.

Product ranges  Currently, Bulthaup offers three product ranges: b1, b2 and b3.  Bulthaup b1  b1 takes a purist approach to the kitchen. The doors and pull-outs can all be opened without handles.

Bulthaup b2  The b2 range is a continuation of Otl Aicher‚Äôs ‚Äúkitchen workshop‚Äù. It comprises two cabinets housing everything from dishes to a refrigerator, dishwasher and oven. Each item is immediately accessible as soon as the doors are opened. A workbench incorporates the water point and cooktop. And the interior of the cabinets and the workbench both have a modular design.  Bulthaup b3  One of the defining elements of the b3 range is the multi-function wall installed in front of the actual wall, for hanging kitchen utensils, cabinets, and other elements. These can be freely positioned according to the requirements of the specific room. The result is a kitchen that appears to float. But the multi-function wall doesn‚Äôt only support kitchen tools and cabinets. Knife blocks, kitchen roll holders and shelves can also be hung from its grooves. In addition, function boxes with hinged openings provide additional storage space, keeping all utensils, food, and herbs and spices close to hand.

The video features a little girl lost in industrial building, running away from various grotesque characters she encounters, resembling the English novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Within the video, she crosses Dero, dressed in a top hat and suit (presumably as the Mad Hatter), a menacing- looking anthropomorphic rabbit in a BDSM collar and leash, an old woman with sharpened teeth who is drinking blood (the Queen of Hearts), and Crap and Flux. She runs away after seeing the blood and tries to escape through a mirror. She is then caught by Dero, who wraps her in a red fabric, but the girl escapes using the scissors she picked up at the beginning of the video. As she runs into another room, she encounters a double of herself, but with white hair and glowing eyes, painting white roses red. Frightened by this sight, the girl continues to run, dropping the scissors. Her double then cuts one of the painted rosebuds off with the scissors, letting it hit the floor in a red splash.

On its original schedule, the train ran from the Texas and Pacific station in Fort Worth to Union Station in Houston in exactly five hours, making only four intermediate stops in Dallas, Waxahachie, Corsicana, and Teague. The train was designated number 3 southbound, and number 4 northbound. Its chief competitor was the Sunbeam, operated by the Texas and New Orleans Railroad (a subsidiary of the Southern Pacific) on a parallel route between Dallas and Houston. One of the original trainsets from the Twin Cities Zephyr, number 9901, was transferred to begin this new route. While under the management of the Rock Island, Zephyr 9901 power car was destroyed by fire on December 19, 1944. The Rock Island did not maintain the train properly; the cause of the fire was oil residue which poor maintenance failed to remove. Because equipment was needed to keep the busy line running, the Rock Island replaced its Texas Rocket with the new Twin Star Rocket in July 1945.

It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1974, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Description Building interior, looking down at the light court The Farwell Building is an eight-story rectangular building built of brick, and designed in the Chicago school architectural style. The front fa√ßade makes extensive use of glass, and includes both horizontal and vertical elements. A horizontal frieze crosses the fa√ßade at the entrance level, and a second frieze decorated with triglyphs and metopes adorns the second story. Ionic pilasters stand at the corners of the building and flanking the central entrance. Iron grillwork decorates the entrance transom, and the interior features a Tiffany mosaic ceiling, brass elevator doors, and marble walls. History The Farwell Building is named for the estate of Jesse H. and Emmer J. Farwell. The building was completed in 1915 from plans made by architect Harrie W. Bonnah. The decorative (and structural) ironwork was made by the Russell Wheel and Foundry Company of Detroit. In 1956, the Farwell was significantly altered: the original terra cotta cornice with Pewabic tiles was removed, and significant changes were made to the ground level fa√ßade. Higgins Management Company purchased the Farwell during the 1970s and renovated the building for retail office space. However, since 1984, the building has been completely vacant. In October 2009, the State of Michigan announced it was in negotiations to buy the building from the current owners through the federal Neighborhood Stabilization Program with a final sale price expected to be over US$3 million, less past-due property taxes owed on the building. In April 2012, Lansing-based Karp and Associates submitted a successful bid to restore the building and the nearby Detroit Savings Bank Building to house residential units, offices and retail space. Part of the renovations will include recreating the cornice removed in 1957.

The club currently plays in the National Premier Leagues NSW 3 after being relegated from the NPL NSW 2 in 2019. Canterbury Bankstown hosts matches at The Crest Reserve in Bass Hill, Sydney. History They were one of the first football clubs formed in Sydney and competed in the first ever New South Wales State League as Canterbury FC, the club has also been known as Canterbury-Marrickville Olympic and West Sydney Berries; the \\"Berry\\" part of the name derives from Canter-\\"bury.\\" Since that time, the club has enjoyed some years of success and also painful years of premiership droughts and grand final losses. The club played in the 1986 season of the National Soccer League.OzFootball 1986 NSL Table retrieved 17 August 2008 Having been one of the bigger and more successful district clubs in Sydney, by the mid 1960s the club found itself in severe financial strife. A group of influential and disgruntled Pan-Hellenic (Sydney Olympic) members and supporters decided because of various disputes to leave and enquired about investing in the club. It was all agreed that Canterbury would sell a controlling stake of the club to this group of investors, who wanted to form the basis of a 2nd big Greek soccer club in Sydney to challenge Pan-Hellenic, later to be known as Canterbury-Marrickville Olympic Soccer Club. In the mid-2000s the club had changed its name from Canterbury-Marrickville Olympic to West Sydney Berries to increase its appeal across South-western Sydney. It was the first time in the club's history club played without Canterbury in its name except for the period when they were known solely as Marrickville Olympic during the late 70's early 80's. The club was chosen by Football NSW to be automatically promoted along with Macarthur Rams to the NSW Premier League for the 2008 NSWPL Season. The main reason for the club's inclusion was to strengthen football's presence in Western Sydney and also to have a starting post for a possible Western Sydney franchise in the A-League. The team had an unsuccessful return to the top-flight league in New South Wales. The team managed a lowly 10th place and narrowly escaped relegation from the NSW Premier League. In July 2008 the West Sydney Berries announced they had raised more than $ 32.000 for the Hospital at Westmead.Berries 4 Kids Berries 4 Kids raises $32,000 retrieved 19 September 2008 After finishing last in the 2010 NSW Premier League season the club was relegated to the NSW Super League for the 2011 season, and for the 2012 NSW Super League season was known as Bankstown Berries FC and has since been renamed Canterbury Bankstown FC. Johnny Warren, after whom Australian football's greatest prize, the Johnny Warren Medal is named is the best known personality of the history of the club. Alongside John Watkiss he participated in the World Cup 1974 in Germany. Graham Arnold, Charlie Yankos, goalkeeper Ron Corry, Peter Katholos, John Watkiss and Zlatko Arambasic are also Australian internationals who originated in the ranks of the club.

Pletriach, or Pleteriach) is a Carthusian monastery, or charterhouse, in the village of Drƒça near ≈†entjernej in Slovenia, the only extant monastery of that order in the country.Carthusian Order official website History First foundation Pleterje Charterhouse: the medieval church The monastery, situated in a valley at the foot of the Gorjanci mountains, was founded in 1403 by Count Hermann II of Celje, and its construction completed by 1407. The Austrian mystic and theologian Nikolaus Kempf was prior here from 1447 to 1451 and again from 1462 to 1467. In 1471 an Ottoman raid destroyed the buildings, which were reconstructed in a much stronger and more easily defensible manner. After a long period of decline Archduke Ferdinand II of Inner Austria gave the monastery in 1595 to the Jesuits of Ljubljana. When the Jesuits were suppressed in 1772, Pleterje became state property. In 1839 it passed into private hands. Second foundation In 1899 the Carthusians reacquired the site and began construction of a new monastery, which was completed five years later. During World War II the charterhouse suffered severe damage when in 1943 it was set on fire by Communist partisans. Present day Pleterje Charterhouse: monastery buildings The charterhouse has remained a Carthusian monastery to this day. The buildings date from the second foundation in the late 19th century, except for the Gothic church, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, which survives from the earlier monastery. Produce The monks cultivate 30 hectares of land, mostly for fruit and honey, which they sell, and from which they also produce wine, fruit spirits (especially pear brandy), mead and beeswax candles. Art collection The community at Pleterje are the owners of a significant collection of several dozen paintings, which for the sake of the peace of the community have been deposited on permanent loan for exhibition in a gallery in Kostanjevica na Krki. The paintings date from the 17th and 18th centuries, and are attributed to Flemish, French, Italian and German artists. They seem mostly to have reached Pleterje with refugee monks from Bosserville Charterhouse in Lorraine, who were given shelter in Pleterje in 1904. Museums The monastery accommodates a display of items from the collections of the Dolenjska Museum of local history, and on part of its lands stands the Pleterje Charterhouse Open Air Museum of typical Slovenian peasant buildings.

The clan was based primarily in Shakujii castle, in what is today Shakujii Park in the town of Shakujii, in Nerima-ku, until the fall of the castle in the late 1470s to Ogigayatsu Uesugi clan vassal ≈åta D≈çkan. History The clan made its chief seat of governance in the area around the Hiratsuka Shrine in what is today the Nakazato area of Tokyo's North Ward (Kita-ku), and expanded their influence over the years to cover a much wider area, delegating much of it to branch families such as the Miyagi, Takinogawa, Shimura, and Itabashi clans. The Toshima obtained and moved into Shakujii towards the end of the Kamakura period (1185-1333). The clan's power and lineage solidified over the 13th-14th centuries. Though a number of clan heads had no direct male heir, for roughly one century from 1282 to 1395 the clan was supported by the Miyagi clan, with whom the Toshima shared territory and intermarried. Miyagi Tamenori was the son of Miyagi Masanori and a daughter of Toshima Shigehiro; Tamenori would in turn father 11th clan head Toshima Munetomo. Following the death of ninth clan head Toshima Yasukage, on account of the minority of his son Toshima Tomoyasu, Yasukage's brother Toshima Kagemura took over as clan head. He expanded and solidified the clan's control over the districts of Toshima, Adachi, Tama, Niiza and Kodama. Toshima-san D≈çj≈ç-ji, which would later become the chief clan temple of the Toshima, was established in 1372 in a location adjacent to Shakujii castle by Kagemura's adopted son, Toshima Terutoki. Terutoki's birth father, H≈çj≈ç Tokiyuki, was hidden and protected at Shakujii during the Nakasendai Rebellion (1335) by Toshima Kagemura; since Kagemura lacked a male heir, Terutoki was adopted to succeed him as clan head. He died in 1375, and when his son Toshima Kagenori died in turn, leaving no heir, the position of clan head passed to Toshima Munetomo; as described above, Munetomo was related to the Miyagi family, and was of a different branch of the Toshima clan from the previous clan heads. Another temple strongly associated with the clan, Sanb≈ç-ji, was established to the east of Shakujii castle in 1394. It is said to have been moved to its current location on the edge of Sanb≈ç-ji Pond, one of two ponds which form the center of modern-day Shakujii Park, by ≈åta D≈çkan, following the destruction of the Toshima clan by his hand in the late 1470s. Thirteenth clan head Toshima Noriyasu led the clan in siding with Uesugi Norimoto, general of Ashikaga Mochiuji's forces, during the 1417 rebellion of Uesugi Zensh≈´. In the political and military conflicts surrounding the Ky≈çtoku Incident (1454-1482), the Toshima clan at first supported Ashikaga Shigeuji, but later switched sides to support Uesugi Fusaaki and Uesugi Akisada of the Yamanouchi branch of the Uesugi clan. During this time, Uesugi vassal Nagao Kageharu rebelled against the Uesugi clan and, along with the Ashikaga, sought to take control of the Kant≈ç region. Toshima clan heads Toshima Yasutsune, lord of Shakujii and Nerima castles, and his brother Toshima Yasuaki, lord of Hiratsuka castle, sided with Kageharu, and were ultimately defeated by Uesugi vassal ≈åta D≈çkan, marking the demise of the clan.

She was formerly the representative of the 18th Legislative District in the County Legislature of Nassau County, New York, as well as the former Presiding Officer of the Nassau County Legislature and the former Minority Leader of the Nassau County Legislature. Background Diane grew up in the Soundview and Morris Park sections of the Bronx borough in New York City. Prior to starting a career in politics, Diane established herself as a businesswoman by serving as Second Vice President of Chase Manhattan Bank. She is also known as a noteworthy activist in the Long Island community by serving as Vice President of the Oyster Bay- East Norwich Boys and Girls Club, as well as a former board member of Portledge School. Diane has also taught religion at St. Rocco's Church in Glen Cove. Today, she maintains her strong ties with community through active membership at the Glen Cove Sons of Italy, Glen Cove Chamber of Commerce, the Junior League, and the North Shore Historical Museum. Diane currently resides in Glen Cove, New York with her husband, Bernie. Together, they have two children: son Michael and daughter Noelle. Political career Diane served 4 terms in the Nassau County Legislature, having been elected in 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2009. In 2008, Diane was sworn in as Presiding Officer of the Nassau County Legislature and served in this role through 2009. When the Nassau County Democratic Party lost the majority in the 2009 election, Diane became the Minority Leader starting in 2010. First term, 2004-2005 In her first term, Yatauro pioneered the Collette Coyne Cancer Prevention Bill, which is designed to protect teens from the dangers of tanning salons. Diane appeared on several media outlets in the New York metropolitan area, which led to adoption of this bill in areas nationwide. For this effort, she was honored by the Collette Coyne Melanoma Awareness Campaign. Legislator Yatauro also successfully co-sponsored the \\"Tobacco 19\\" law, which increased the smoking age to 19 in an effort to keep cigarettes out of Nassau County high schools. Yatauro was also responsible for helping to push a living wage law, increasing the minimum wage for all employees of County hired contractors. Second term, 2006-2007 In her second term, Diane co- authored the environmental bond referendums, which guaranteed a $100 million environmental bond for the county in 2006(she was also a co-author in the referendum which secured a $50 environmental bond in 2004). After several decades of neglect, Yatauro was instrumental in addressing the environmental problems facing the residents of The Birches, a community within Locust Valley. By helping to pass legislation for a pump station in the area, sewage seepage is now prevented from seeping onto local streets. Third term, 2008-2009 After winning her 2007 election, with the Nassau Democrats still holding the majority, Judy Jacobs stepped down as Presiding Officer and Yatauro was sworn in as the Presiding Officer of the Legislative body. In her third term, Diane created three new committees within the legislature: Education, Aging, and Veterans. During this time, she also was vital in creating a property tax exemption for Cold War Veterans as well as supporting a \\"Green Procurement\\" incentive, which requires Nassau County to purchase environmentally safe products and services. Fourth term, 2010-2012 With the Nassau Democrats losing the majority, Diane was sworn in as the Minority Leader of the Legislative body. Legislator Yatauro continued her strong commitment to improving quality of life within her district, as well as maintaining a conservative stance on fiscal matters and remaining a community activist. By the end of 2009, Yatauro secured Community Revitalization Funding for improvements to the 18th Legislative District‚Äôs parks, sidewalks, roadways and shopping areas. Because of her contribution to the Nassau Legislature, Diane was a proud recipient of the 2009 Long Island Business News Top Fifty Influential Women Award. In April 2011, Yatauro announced that she would not seek re-election, to help on her daughter's acting aspirations. In January 2012, she officially vacated her post to Delia DeRiggi-Whitton, who was elected legislator of the 18th district.

Signs and symptoms The internal location of the fallopian tubes makes it difficult to reach an early diagnosis. Symptoms are nonspecific, and may consist of pain and vaginal discharge or bleeding. A pelvic mass may be detected on a routine gynecologic examination. Vaginal discharge in fallopian tube carcinoma results from intermittent hydrosalphinx, also known as hydrops tubae profluens. Pathology The most common cancer type within this disease is adenocarcinoma; in the largest series of 3,051 cases as reported by Stewart et al. 88% of cases fell into this category. According to their study, half of the cases were poorly differentiated, 89% unilateral, and the distribution showed a third each with local disease only, with regional disease only, and with distant extensions. Rarer forms of tubal neoplasm include leiomyosarcoma, and transitional cell carcinoma. As the tumor is often enmeshed with the adjacent ovary, it may be the pathologist and not the surgeon who determines that the lesion is indeed tubal in origin. Secondary tubal cancer usually originates from cancer of the ovaries, the endometrium, the GI tract, the peritoneum, and the breast. Diagnosis A pelvic examination may detect an adnexal mass. A CA-125 blood test is a nonspecific test that tends to be elevated in patients with tubal cancer. More specific tests are a gynecologic ultrasound examination, a CT scan, or an MRI of the pelvis. Occasionally, an early fallopian tube cancer may be detected by chance during pelvic surgery. Staging International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging is done at the time of surgery: :Stage 0 :Carcinoma in situ :Stage I :Growth limited to fallopian tubes :Stage II :Growth involving one or both fallopian tubes with extension to pelvis :Stage III:Tumor involving one or both fallopian tubes with spread outside pelvis :Stage IV :Growth involving one or more fallopian tubes with distant metastases Treatment The initial approach to tubal cancer is generally surgical, and similar to that of ovarian cancer. As the lesion will spread first to the adjacent uterus and ovary, a total abdominal hysterectomy is an essential part of this approach, removing the ovaries, the tubes, and the uterus with the cervix. Also, peritoneal washings are taken, the omentum is removed, and pelvic and paraaortic lymph nodes are sampled. Staging at the time of surgery and pathological findings will determine further steps. In advanced cases when the cancer has spread to other organs and cannot be completely removed, cytoreductive surgery is used to lessen the tumor burden for subsequent treatments. Surgical treatments are typically followed by adjuvant, usually platinum-based, chemotherapy. Radiation therapy has been applied with some success to patients with tubal cancer for palliative or curative indications Prognosis Prognosis depends to a large degree on the stage of the condition. In 1991 it was reported that about half of the patients with advanced stage disease survived 5 years with a surgical approach followed by cisplatinum-based chemotherapy. Frequency Tubal cancer is thought to be a relatively rare primary cancer among women, accounting for 1 to 2 percent of all gynecologic cancers, accessed 08-14-2008 In the US, tubal cancer had an incidence of 0.41 per 100,000 women from 1998 to 2003. Demographic distribution is similar to that of ovarian cancer, and the highest incidence is found in white, non-Hispanic women aged 60‚Äì79. However, recent evidence suggests tubal cancer to be much more frequent .

It was designed by the architectural firm of Starrett & van Vleck and opened in 1908. Goldwin Starrett, the lead architect, had worked for Daniel Burnham for four years in Chicago, and as such the building reflects Burnham's functionalist philosophy. It marked the development of fireproof commercial skyscrapers with open plan interiors and simple, classical exteriors. In 1988, the Everett Building was designated a New York City landmark., p.76 The Everett Building, along with the W New York Union Square (formerly Germania Life Insurance Company Building) at the northeast corner of Park Avenue South and 17th Street, were described by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission as forming an \\"imposing terminus to Park Avenue South\\". The Everett Building is located directly east of the Century Building, another New York City landmark.  History  The site of the Everett Building was initially part of the colonial farm owned by Dutch settler Cornelius Tiebout. Union Square was first laid out in the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, expanded in 1832, and then made into a public park in 1839. The completion of the park led to the construction of mansions surrounding it, and the Everett House hotel, located on the north side of East 17th Street. was among one of several fashionable buildings completed around Union Square. After the American Civil War, Union Square became a primarily commercial area and many mansions were destroyed, including Everett House. By the first decade of the 20th century, Union Square had grown into a major transportation hub with several elevated and surface railroad lines running nearby, and the New York City Subway's 14th Street‚ÄìUnion Square station opening in 1904. Plans for the development of a 20-story office building on the site of Everett House were first announced in June 1908. Goldwin Starrett of Starrett & van Vleck was selected to design the building in early August. When the plans were publicly released at the end of that month, there was high demand for industrial loft and office space in the area. Only four months elapsed between the building's groundbreaking ceremony and the initial spaces being ready for tenants. Upon opening, the Everett Building was one of the many buildings around Union Square and Park Avenue that were occupied by the cotton, dry-goods, wool, and silk industries. Space in the Everett Building and several others on Union Square's northern end was cheaper than the industrial space on Fifth Avenue, two blocks west, and as a result the Everett Building's space was in high demand. By October 1911, the Real Estate Record & Guide wrote that the Everett Building was fully occupied. Though the building was erected for the Everett Investing Company, its other tenants worked in a variety of industries, and included silk sellers William Skinner and Sons, construction contractors W. G. Cornell, and even the offices of Starrett & van Vleck.  Description  The Everett Building is located on a reverse-\\"L\\"-shaped site measuring along Park Avenue South and along 17th Street. The building has arms extending to the north and west, and a rectangular recess is located at the northwest corner of the building. It is 17 stories tall and supported by a frame of structural steel. The 17th story is located behind the cornice at the top of the 16th story, and is only visible on the northern and western sides.  Design  Facade, side view When erected, the Everett Building's design was described by the Real Estate Record as being among several \\"strictly commercial\\" buildings on Park Avenue South that were \\"thoroughly contemporary\\" and built at a fast pace. Starrett & van Vleck used a grid-like pattern on the fourth through 14th floor, creating an exterior articulation depicting the structural frame inside, and thus fulfilled a key design principle of the Chicago school architectural style. The Everett Building was also one of the first buildings to use terracotta as a primary material for the entire facade, rather than a secondary undercoating or as an ornamental element. According to critic A. C. David, the optimal building design included high ceilings and large windows to maximize natural light coverage. The Everett Building not only included these features, but also had a corner location that was conducive toward the maximization of natural light. In addition, the Everett Building's design complied with building codes and insurance companies' fireproofing stipulations, while combining several elements to cut costs, features that David described as being part of the optimal building design.  Facade  The Everett Building's facade consists primarily of white terracotta panels. There are eight vertical architectural bays facing Park Avenue South and six bays facing 17th Street. There are storefronts at ground level. Starting at the second level, most of the bays are divided into three windows, except for the second- to-northernmost bay on the Park Avenue South facade, which only has two window bays. On the southern and eastern facades, the ground and second floors comprise the base of the building. These floors have a facade with rusticated architectural piers containing several rows of textured masonry blocks. Above the second floor is a decorated cornice with metopes and triglyphs. The facade outside the third story contains ornamented vertical piers and pilasters, with decorated capitals at their tops, and a frieze runs above the third story. The fourth through 14th stories comprise the building's vertical \\"shaft\\" section. The exterior contains raised vertical mullions on the outer edges of the piers, as well as raised horizontal spandrel beams on the outer edges of the spaces between the windows on each floor, creating a grid-like pattern. The facade of the \\"shaft\\" is topped by a belt course above the 14th floor. The 15th and 16th floors contain orange and green terracotta decoration. Rectangular orange panels are placed on the space between floors, as well as on the piers between architectural bays, while circular green panels are placed in the middle of the piers between each floor, at the midpoints between four rectangular panels. An intricately molded cornice is located above the 16th floor. The northern and western facades consist of white buff brick with windows on the 9th through 17th floors, and have very little ornamentation.

History  The Chung Hua Sheng Kung Hui was established on 26 April 1912 by the merger of the various mission activities of the Church of England, the Episcopal Church of the United States, Anglican Church of Canada and other Anglican provinces into one autonomous jurisdiction. The merger of the respective Anglican missionary initiatives in China into one national church echoed similar steps that were taken in 1887 to establish the Nippon Sei Ko Kai or Anglican Church in Japan. After 1949, its dioceses in Hong Kong and Macao became the Anglican Diocese of Hong Kong and Macao, later reorganized as an independent Anglican province, the Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui. Those who fled to Taiwan with the Chinese Nationalists established the Episcopal Diocese of Taiwan, a diocese of the Episcopal Church of the United States.

The first bishop of the diocese Geoffrey Durnford Iliff, consecrated in 1903The American Church Almanac and Year Book, 1911, Bishops of the Anglican Communion, 1912, p. 452) had a cathedral church at Tai-an-Fu built of local granite in 1913,The Building News and Engineering Journal, vol. 105, no. 3068, 24 Oct Oct. 1913, p. 582 and consecrated in 1915. He was succeeded by Thomas Arnold Scott in 1921. Scott served the diocese until 1940, when he was translated to the diocese of North China. The third and last bishop before nationalisation took place after the victory of the Chinese Communists was John Wellington.

It consists of a cluster of buildings centered on the crossing of Jackson Village Road over the Wildcat River, extending on both sides of the river along Five Mile Circuit Road (aka Black Mountain Road) and Carter Notch Road, both of which are part of New Hampshire Route 16B. Most of the properties in the district were built between the 1860s and the 1930s, and are reflective of the community's growth as a summer resort area. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Description and history The town of Jackson was first settled in the 1770s, and was incorporated as \\"Adams\\" in 1800; it was renamed Jackson in 1828, after President Andrew Jackson. At first agricultural in nature, the area's scenic beauty began to draw artists and tourists. By the late 1840s a small tourist industry had arisen. Larger hotels began to be built in Jackson in the 1860s, with further growth spurred by completion of the Portland and Ogdensburg Railroad in the 1870s. The village center of Jackson Falls experienced its largest period of growth between 1880 and the 1930s. The village of Jackson Falls consists of a mix of civic, religious, commercial, and private residential buildings. The most prominent building is probably the Wentworth Castle, which is on the hillside above the Wentworth Hall resort hotel complex. Completed in 1891, it was designed by New York architect William Bates. The district also includes Jackson's 1901 library building, old (1897) town hall, and a community church built in 1846‚Äì47.

Becoming Justice Blackmun. Times Books. 2005. Page 183. Decision In 1982, Pennsylvania passed the Abortion Control Act, which imposed a 24 hour waiting period and required that prospective patients be provided with information (such as the probable stage of the patient's pregnancy, the availability of child welfare benefits, and the possibility of receiving child support from the patient's sexual partner) as part of the \\"informed consent\\" process prior to all abortion procedures. https://www.thirteen.org/wnet/supremecourt/rights/print/landmark_casey.html#:~:text=In%201982%2C%20Pennsylvania%20passed%20the,provided%20with%20information%20regarding%20abortions https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/476/747/ The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists filed suit in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania seeking an injunction to prevent the law from being enforced on constitutional grounds. The district court denied the plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief and the plaintiffs appealed to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. The Third Circuit then reversed and enjoined enforcement of the Act. Pennsylvania then appealed to the Supreme Court which granted review. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court affirmed the Third Circuit's decision to enjoin enforcement of the Act. Justice Harry Blackmun, writing for the majority, held that the Act's requirement of providing information to the patient as part of the \\"informed consent\\" process \\"seem[s] to us to be nothing less than an outright attempt to wedge the Commonwealth's message discouraging abortion into the privacy of the informed-consent dialogue between the woman and her physician.\\" https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/476/747/ Justice Sandra Day O'Connor distanced herself from the court in dissent, \\"disput[ing] not only the wisdom but also the legitimacy of the Court's attempt to discredit and pre-empt state abortion regulation regardless of the interests it serves and the impact it has.\\" The 7-2 majority of Roe had now shrunk to 6-3.

Most of his life was spent in the midwest, particularly Indiana and Wisconsin. Life and career Born in Huntingburg, Indiana, Miessner was the son of Charles Miessner and Mary Miessner (n√©e Reutepohler) and the older brother of Benjamin Franklin Miessner. He graduated from Huntingburg High School in 1898. He earned a diploma from the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music, where he studied music theory with A. J. Gantvoort, piano with Frederick Hoffman, and singing with Adolph Devin-Duvivier. He later pursued further studies in New York with Frederick Bristol (singing), A. J. Goodrich (harmony and counterpoint), and Edgar Stillman Kelley (composition). He also studied voice in Berlin, taking lessons in 1910 with Alexander Heinemann. He then taught music from 1900 until 1904 at a school in Boonville, Indiana, before going to Connersville to teach elementary and high school music; he stayed there from 1905 until 1909. Miessner has been quoted as saying that \\"The idle mind is the devil‚Äôs workshop. But this is my workshop and I‚Äôll not tolerate an idle mind as long as there‚Äôs excitement in music.\\" One day in 1906, Miessner met three students in the street; they had been suspended from school earlier in the day due to misbehavior. The three were watching a minstrel show, keeping time with their hands while listening. Miessner made a deal with the three boys: he would get them reinstated in school if they, in exchange, would learn to play instruments in a school band which he was at the time planning to form. They agreed; Miessner, for his part, encouraged them to practice by promising them a public concert and uniforms in the school colors. The experiment was a success, and Connersville High School became possessed of the first public high school band in the United States. Miessner received a great deal of exposure for his work in starting the band, which was chosen to perform at a convention of the Northern and Southern Indiana Teacher‚Äôs Association in 1908. This performance received a notice in School Music, at the time a national publication for music educators, and Miessner's name was made. Miessner went on to serve in a number of teaching and administrative positions during the remainder of his career. He was the director of the music schools of Milwaukee State Teachers College from 1914 until 1922, and from 1911 until 1924 taught at summer sessions at Northwestern University. He founded the Miessner Institute of Music in Milwaukee in 1924. In the early 1930s he worked with his brother, Benjamin, to invent an instrument called a rhythmicon. Unfortunately for them, L√©on Theremin had already developed a similar instrument with the same name. In 1936 he became head of the Department of Music Education at the University of Kansas, where he headed the graduate studies program and remained until 1945. In addition, he co-edited music textbooks for Silver Burdett for forty years and served ten years as president of the Miessner Piano Company in Milwaukee. He also received many honors for his work as an educator, including honorary doctorates from the Cincinnati Conservatory and Chicago Musical College. He was a life member of the Music Educators National Conference, whose president he was from 1923 until 1924; he was also a member of Phi Delta Kappa, Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, and Pi Kappa Lambda. While in Boonville, he also served as a music director for a number of local organizations, including the Methodist church. In 1986 he was inducted into the Music Educators National Conference Hall of Fame. Upon his retirement, Miessner returned to Connersville. Upon learning that no music teacher could be found for some of the local schools, he obtained an emergency permit that allowed him to return to teaching for three years, beginning in 1956. He was then told that he would have to take a beginners' course in teaching to retain his permit; feeling that his experience as a teacher should exempt him from such work, he declined. He died in Connersville in 1967. Miessner is primarily remembered as an educator, but he wrote music as well. Most of his music was composed for choir, but he also wrote songs as well as some pieces for piano. He also wrote pedagogical works for beginning violinists and pianists, and compiled teaching materials about symphonic music and American songs.

History  left The Nittany Lion Shrine at Pennsylvania State University was dedicated on October 24, 1942 during Homecoming. Animalier Heinz Warneke and stonecutter Joseph Garatti created it from a 13-ton block of Indiana Limestone. The shrine was chosen from six models submitted by Warneke. The shrine is a gift of the class of 1940 and rests in a natural setting of trees near Recreation Building. In 2013 the shrine was renovated to improve the lighting, add a sidewalk, and add large decorative stones. The improvement was the gift by the Penn State's class of 2012. Incidents In 1966 Sue Paterno (wife of football coach Joe Paterno), and a friend secretly splashed water-soluble orange paint on the Nittany Lion statue the week of the Syracuse game. Later that week Syracuse fans covered the statue in oil-based paint, which was tougher to remove. Since then, students guard the Lion Shrine every homecoming. Actually, six Syracuse University students painted the Nittany Lion on Wednesday night, Nov. 2, 1966. The six students had driven from Syracuse to State College that evening with an old, air-loaded fire extinguisher filled with orange paint. Arriving on the Penn State campus, they found the Nittany Lion statue flood lit, deserted and completely clean. Within minutes they had painted the lion, jumped back in their car and driven away from campus, undetected. On the way out of town they spotted a sign for Beaver Stadium, and turned into the parking lot there, prepared to paint the goal posts orange as well. This proved their undoing when the police at the Stadium (guarding the ABC Television equipment for the Saturday game broadcast) switched on the Stadium lights and raced towards the end zone where the students were. As the students fled, one of them became tangled climbing over the 5-foot high chain-link fence surrounding the field. He was taken into custody by the police, and released the following morning. The students were subsequently brought before the SU Student Court, but the case was dismissed as a simple ‚Äúcollege prank‚Äù. In addition, the student paper, The Daily Orange, published an editorial lauding the students and helped organize a fund of student donations to pay for the sandblasting required to remove the paint. The clean up was nearly complete by game-time on Nov. 5th. This prank re- ignited a tradition that had become dormant among eastern football schools‚Äô rivalries. Attempts at similar pranks were then repeated many times in subsequent years. Syracuse University Daily Orange/ vol 64, No. 39, Nov. 14, 1966, page 1, page 2-Editorial In another football weekend incident in 1978, the Lion Shrine was vandalized when a blunt object was used to break off the statue's right ear. The original sculptor ‚Äì Heinz Warneke ‚Äì was alive at the time and, with some difficulty, was able to match the stone and repair the damaged ear. This incident led to the site being guarded during home football games. The right ear was vandalized again in 1997. In 2003 and 2018, the ear was broken off again, but it is unsure whether or not it was due to vandalism.http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2018/02/28/penn-state-nittany-lion- shrine-repaired/ Gallery File:Nittany Lion Shrine (1).JPG File:Nittany Lion Shrine (3).JPG File:Nittany Lion Shrine (5).JPG Nittany Lion Shrine replicas Almost every one of the Pennsylvania State University Commonwealth campuses has a replica of the Nittany Lion Shrine.

Skidmore Victory (MCV hull 685) was delivered to Northland Transportation on 18 June 1945. Victory ships were a class of cargo ship produced in large numbers by American shipyards during World War II to replace losses caused by German submarines. They were slightly larger, more modern design when compared to the earlier Liberty ships, with a more powerful steam turbine engine allowing them to join high speed convoys and to make a more difficult target for German U-boats.

A mobile tracking platform for recording data on missiles and satellites that are out of range of established land stations, Range Tracker was homeported at Port Hueneme, California, on the Pacific Missile Range from June 1961 to 1969. She was operated by the Military Sea Transportation Service with a civilian crew.  Tracking astronauts  USNS Range Tracker inertial navigation system monitored astronaut Gordon Cooper's 22-orbit space flight during July 1963.  Out of service In 1969, when the Air Force Systems Command no longer needed Range Tracker, she was placed out of service at Port Hueneme 27 September 1969; transferred to the U.S. Maritime Administration 12 November 1969; and laid up at Suisun Bay. On 10 July 1970, she was sold to American Ship Dismantlers, Inc., for scrapping.

She was raised by her grandmother in the rural countryside of Korea but abandoned in Seoul at a young age on a rainy night. Her mother was also buried on a rainy day, therefore causing Bun-nyuh to have a phobia of rain.The Antique Gift Shop, by Eun Lee, Vol. 6, chapt. 8 \\"Go? Or Stop?\\" Bun-nyuh was raised in a Christian orphanage and watched over by a distant relative during her adolescence.The Antique Gift Shop, Vol. 2, chapt. 3 \\"The Secret Garden\\" Because of her tomboyish and rough attitude, she was much admired by the girls in school when she was younger.The Antique Gift Shop, by Eun Lee, Vol. 1, chapt. 3 \\"The Secret Garden\\" Though she is able to see spirits and ghosts, she stubbornly refuses to admit belief in anything that can't be explained by science. Bun-nyuh also excels in fortune-telling, just like her mother and grandmother. She has a selective memory of the tragic events in her past and is constantly in denial of her true feelings. She hates feeling weak or helpless. Bun-nyuh is also very modern, cursing and swearing and giving the one-fingered salute wherever she goes. She loves designer labels and would rather go shopping than pay her employees. She maintained excellent grades while in school before taking a leave of absence from the prestigious S University.The Antique Gift Shop, by Eun Lee, Vol. 3, chapt. 5 \\"Gahwi\\" Despite her loathing for it, she is also an excellent salesperson.The Antique Gift Shop, by Eun Lee, Vol. 2, chapt. 3 \\"The Secret Garden\\" Yang/Mr. Yang: The only employee of the Antique Gift Shop, Mr. Yang is almost 7 feet tall and has long, silky hair flowing nearly to the floor. He has a very god- like quality about him. When he is not dressed in his shop uniform and apron, he dons archaic embroidered robes and very old-fashioned clothing. His delicate features are very beautiful and almost feminine. Though not revealed in volumes 1 - 6, the reader has the sense that he has known Bun-nyuh's family for quite some time. He refers to her ancestral village as his \\"hometown.\\" He also possesses the ability to \\"speak\\" to the antiques and to read minds.The Antique Gift Shop, by Eun Lee, Vol. 1, chapt. 1 \\"The Summer Guest\\" Though he dislikes humans for their inability to believe things they don't understand our cannot see, he is known by the antiques as \\"the one who serves humans.\\" There is the sense that he has served one human in particular, Bun-nyuh, for centuries. Mr. Yang actually knows more about Bun-nyuh and her family than he lets on, and more than even Bun-nyuh is aware of herself. Though their relationship is often characterized as \\"master-servant\\" in other instances the relationship between Bun-nyuh and Mr. Yang could be characterized as \\"student- teacher.\\" In brief moments in the manhwa, their relationship can be characterized as \\"intimate,\\" as when they go to the movies together, when he puts her to bed as she recovers from a hangover, when he saves her from being raped by the mongdalgui possessed Dan-soo,The Antique Gift Shop, by Eun Lee, Vol. 3, chapt. 4 \\"The Secret Garden\\" and when he tells the hwatu characters to cheer her up while he's gone because he knows it will rain.The Antique Gift Shop, by Eun Lee, Vol. 5, chapt. 8 \\"Go? Or Stop?\\" Grandmother: Bun-nyuh's only living blood relative in the world, her grandmother is a shaman of the Divine Spirit and can see ghosts/spirits, conduct purifications, exorcisms and predict/read fortunes. She is mysteriously under a curse and is constantly hounded by a 'spirit guide' who takes the form of a woman in white with long hair. Her spirit guide claims that Bun-nyuh's grandmother 'owes her' but is willing take over Bun-nyuh to satisfy this debt. The nature of grandmother's curse stems from both her and her spirit guide having the same fianc√© in the past who collected the cursed antiques to begin with, Mr. Sailor Park. Bun- nyuh's grandmother abandoned her in Seoul to let her granddaughter live a 'normal' life for as long as possible before the family curse caught up with Bun-nyuh. Ie-rang Ha/Nae-soong Ha: Bun-nyuh's best friend in high school who subsequently became a popular Korean actress. Ie-rang was a beautiful but shy girl who was bullied. Like Bun-nyuh, Ie-rang was primarily an orphan. Bun-nyuh holds a grudge against Ie-rang for stealing her first love. Ie-rang only stole Bun-nyuh's first love because she was in love with Bun-nyuh. She later confesses that Bun-nyuh was her first love in her autobiographical movie, \\"Raise the Flag.\\" Bun-nyuh slept through most of the movie. Ie-rang was supposed to go the US for her career, but she postponed that and additional plastic surgery to pop in on Bun-nyuh from time to time after she discovered Bun-nyuh's Antique Gift Shop. In-gyu: A young man from a wealthy family who has amnesia after a car accident. He loses his lover in the accident and his family will not let him remember her because they disapproved of their union. He is beckoned to wander and find the red lantern he sees in his dreams.

She purchases the Fox Lantern from the shop because its spirit called to her. The lantern brings her dreams of In-gyu and she finds herself falling in love with him and wishing she were Yoon-ju. She is unaware of their plight until she finally meets In-gyu in person. Eun-jae Jung: A young girl who purchases the Hollow Diary from the shop. She intents to share it with her best friend Yang-ji, whom she is secretly in love with. Yang-ji, however, is in love with Dan-soo, a popular boy from school. Eun-jae soon discovers that Dan-soo is a playboy who is dating and mistreating her sister. Yang-ji misunderstands and believes Eun-jae is in love with Dan-soo, thus causing a rift in their relationship. Dan-soo: One of the most good looking and popular boys in school, his classmates are unaware that he made a pact with cursed ghosts called mongdalgui in order to get that way. Over time, he begins to lose control to the mongdalgui and lust after more women and even tries to force himself on Yang-ji and Bun-nyuh. Yang stops him and tells him he must become a monk or he will die young. Yang-ji: Eun-jae's clueless best friend from school who doesn't realize the value of their friendship until she almost loses it. Ji-yong: Bun-nyuh's childhood friend who carried an umbrella everywhere he went and died under mysterious circumstances. His spirit still lingers at Bun-nyuh's ancestral home. Yun-ook: A headstrong mob daughter who is in love with her childhood friend Tae-joo, but can't have him because of a prophecy that she will kill her first husband. Tae-joo: The unlucky object of Yun-ook's desires since childhood. He runs the mob group organized by her father after the untimely death of the mob boss. He is unable to marry because he is in love with Yun-ook. Green Ruperts: Grim reapers who take the dead to Hell. They have pale faces and dress all in black as they carry a list in the form of a scroll with the names of the dead when they work. Their mottos are 'no gambling' and 'precision.' Despite this they have a love for gambling and playing hwatu cards, and on some occasions are not precise in who they claim for dead. The leader of the Green Ruperts has an intimate history with Bun- nyuh's family as he was the one who took her mother on the day she died when he was originally supposed to take Bun-nyuh. Bun-hong: Bun-nyuh's insane mother. Faulted for being 'weak minded' as a shaman, she was possessed and then went insane, was cursed to act like a child for the remainder of her days. She ran away from home and worked in a beauty salon for a time, conceived Bun-nyuh with the son of a wealthy family, and then came back.

Kroeger (August 10, 1862 ‚Äì April 7, 1934) was an American composer. He is mainly known for the pedagogical works he composed for piano; he also taught music in St. Louis, Missouri. Today his papers are held at the Missouri Historical Society. Early life Ernest Richard Kroeger was born in St. Louis, Missouri to Adolph Ernst Kroeger and Eliza Bertha Curren Kroeger. He attended public school and began his musical studies at the age of five. His father, who was an amateur musician, taught him piano. He also learned instrumentation, violin, and harmony under various other teachers, including Egmont Froelich, Ernst Spiering, Charles Kunkel, Wilhelm Goldner, and W. Malm√©ne. At the age of fifteen, he went into the mercantile life only to return to music several years later. He became the organist for various churches around St. Louis, including Trinity Episcopal and the Unitarian Church of the Messiah. Kroeger married on October 10, 1891 to a Miss Laura A. Clark from Lebanon, Missouri. Together they had four children. Middle Age When Kroeger was 42, he was appointed the Master of Programs of the Bureau of Music and responsible for musical programming for the St. Louis World Fair. Rather than emphasizing brass band music as the fair planners had envisioned, Kroeger was intent on including a range of musical styles, composers and media which ultimately enhanced the status of music at the fair. There, he arranged for choral, brass, and band concerts as well as competitions for them as well. Because so many people enjoyed the concerts he put together at the World Fair, the French Academy elected him an Officer. Other institutes he joined were the National Institute of Arts of Letters, and the American Guild of Organists, which he also helped found. The same year that he was the Master of Programs for the St. Louis World Fair he became the Director of the Kroeger School of Music, and kept that position until he died. In 1915, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters (then the National Institute of Arts and Letters). In 1925, he became Director of the Washington University Music Department until 1934, the year of his death. He was also the Director of the Music Department for Forest Park College. Legacy Kroeger's compositions were played all around the United States and Europe during the first couple decades of the 19th century. After Kroeger died in 1934, his daughter, Louise Kroeger, succeeded her father in becoming the Director of the Kroeger School of Music until her retirement in 1975, when she was 84. His son, Richard Clark, served in the World War as a color sergeant of the three hundred and fifty-third infantry of the eighty-ninth division.

If it was John Buttery Jr. who witnessed Lorrain's signature, and not John Buttery Sr., this would have meant he would have been either 18 years or 15 years of age at the time he witnessed the signature. If it was, indeed the same Buttery who would go on to join Lorrain as a partner in Lorrain-Sandilands later on, then it is more likely for him to have been born in 1829 rather than 1831. These dates and sequence of events also suggest his arrival at the Straits Settlements would have been after, rather than before, 1847, and it is possible that Lorrain, then well established in business after his experiences at Douglas, Mackenzie & Co. of Singapore, and Brown & Co. of Penang, sent for Buttery to join him at Lorrain- Sandilands.

They began business in Singapore in 1856 but it was only in 1859 that a branch was established there in Malacca Street. Lorrain-Sandilands was renamed Sandilands and Company in 1862 and, in 1863, changed its name to Sandilands-Buttery following the admittance of John Buttery. Buttery is likely to have been 29 at the time. The entry in Allens Indian Mail (1852), the Straits Times (1853), coupled with the subsequent geographic expansion of Lorrain, Sandilands & Co.'s sphere of business operations, and the plans that Lorrain had for himself, together, suggest that Lorrain had, indeed, brought Buttery over in 1852.

A warm tribute to the late Mr. Arthur George Wright, who died at Mayfield, Sussex on Mar. 14, is paid by a friend writing in the April issue of British Malaya, magazine of the Association of British Malaya in London. Arthur Wright, who was 80 years old, was for many years a partner in the firm of John Buttery and Co. He had been in failing health for the last two years, and although his death was not unexpected, his loss (writes British Malaya's correspondent) will be mourned by all those who knew him. He first joined the firm of John Buttery and Co., Penang, in the early 'eighties, and was in charge of the head office when it was moved to Singapore in 1899. In 1901 he left Malaya to become a partner in the London office, and retired from the firm in 1925. 'A.g.' will be remembered as a most popular personality, and a good all-round sportsman. He was a very good cricketer and a pretty bat. He played for the Straits team for several years and captained it in one of the inter-colonial matches against Hong Kong.\\" Lorrain, Sandilands & Co. was no more and Sandiland's and Buttery's new partnership operated under the names, Sandilands, Buttery & Co., and John Buttery & Co. His name became part of the firm's name upon the departure of Lorrain and not upon his entry into the partnership as some believe - he was already a partner of Lorrain Sandilands before it was dissolved.  Formation of Straits Settlements Association (Penang), 1868  On 25 April 1868, John Buttery joined other British members of Penang's mercantile community in the formation of the Penang chapter of the Straits Settlements Association, which had already been formed in Singapore, and, more importantly, in London.\\"Penang.\\" The London and China Telegraph 15 June 1868: 285.

Sandilands, both of Glasgow, on the site of the present Government buildings. The partners commenced business as East India merchants with an office in Glasgow, but transferred in 1875 to London. Early in the history of the firm Mr. John Allan was taken into partnership. After the death of Mr. Sandilands, at Hampstead, in 1880 and of Mr. Allan in 1894, the firm consisted of J. Buttery, James Gibson, Arthur George Wright, Daniel Gilchrist and A. K. Buttery, the last named two being at Pinang. The London offices are No. 5, Mark Lane, and there is a branch at Singapore. At the present time the firm are general exporters and importers. Their imports comprise all imaginable articles, from cotton goods, iron ware and machinery to wines and spirits. Flake tapioca forms the principal article of export, the firm being agents for the well-known tapioca estates of Batu Puteh in the Kedah district and Alma estate in Province Wellesley. Pepper, nutmegs, cloves and isinglass are dealt in, while Rambong rubber from Sumatra, as well as estate-grown Para rubber was also traded in extensively. Tobacco grown on the famous Paya Jambu estate at Deli, Sumatra, was sent direct by the firm to their brokers in Amsterdam and there sold. They also ship tin largely to all parts of the world, whilst sugar in its raw state from Province Wellesley is consigned to the London and Greenock refineries. Among the agencies held by the firm are those of the National Bank of China, Ltd., National Bank of India Ltd., Clan line of steamers, Ben line, Union line, Mogul line, Warrack line, Pacific Mail Steamship Company, Occidental and Oriental Steamship Company, Tokyo, Kisen, Kaisha, Portland and Asiatic Steamship Company, Lloyd's, Liverpool Underwriters Association, Glasgow; Underwriting Association, London; Imperial Fire Office, Norwich Union Fire Insurance Company, Commercial Union Insurance Company, Ltd., Liverpool and London and Globe Insurance Company, Standard Life Assurance Company, Merchants' Marine Insurance Company Ltd., Union Insurance Company of Canton Ltd., Yangtze insurance Association Ltd., City of Glasgow Life Assurance Company, Globe Marine Insurance Company, World's Marine Insurance Company, Italia Soc.

The firms godowns extend in an unbroken block from Beach Street to Weld Quay. Mr. Alexander Kay Buttery, who was born in Glasgow and educated at Charterhouse and King's College, London, joined the office in Mark Lane and came to the East in 1894. He is a member of the Chamber of Commerce, of the committee of the Turf Club, and of the Pinang Association, a member of all local clubs, a Justice of the Peace, and was a member of the Municipal Council. He is a well- known patron of the turf, owning the horses Diamond Star and Evening Star, which did so well in 1906.

On 12 July he attended the opening of the Prye River Docks in Penang where he received a toast from James Montague Bent Vermont, which Buttery returned on behalf of the mercantile community there, remarking the benefits that the new Prye River Docks would bring to Penang's port, and help extend and develop shipping there.\\"From the Daily Times, 22nd July.

Sandilands, Buttery & Co., and the Penang Land Reclamation Scheme, 1880‚Äî1883  We know Buttery was still in the Straits in 1880 from a comment made by W. G. Gulland, during the 20 August session of the Legislative Council. Gulland had brought up the matter of the purchase of Sandilands, Buttery & Co.s land in Penang that Government had recently bought, and was arguing that the $185,000 paid had been too high, and that the Secretary of State ought not to have bypassed the Council in executing the purchase. He said that Buttery, when he was in Penang three years earlier, could not find a buyer for $100,000. The firm had originally purchased the land for $20,000 to $23,000 and, with the buildings on them, could not be worth more than $40,000, he said, citing Sandilands' own words, spoken publicly. The Colonial Secretary replied that if the land were meant solely for the construction of Government buildings, as suggested by Gulland, then the Government would not have bought the property. This, was not the case. The land had been bought to improve the town ‚Äî the construction of a jetty, and for the approaches from the jetty to the town. Government buildings would, indeed be built, but it was intended to sell a part of or the whole of it, and the cost of this purchase would be recouped from the proceeds of that sale. The Colonial Secretary went on to explain the methodical approach adopted in arriving at the price they felt was appropriate. Several others spoke and the Council ended, divided on the matter.\\"Legislative Council. Monday, 20th August, 1883.\\" Straits Times Weekly Issue [Singapore] 30 Aug. 1883: 12. Print.

These allowed him to network and deal directly with people \\"at the top\\" in an informal, unofficial manner.  The Straits Settlements Benevolent Association and its fund, 1884  He was in London too, in 1884. It has been recorded that the Seniors in London of several of the old Straits Merchants Firms foresaw the necessity of establishing a fund, the object of which was to assist the dependents of former members of the Straits mercantile community who might find themselves stranded upon the loss of their loved ones. The signatories to the original Trust Fund were Edward Boustead, W. W.

It was decided that the Association was opposed to the movement among the population in Singapore to ask Government to strengthen the defences at Singapore, which was in opposition to and inconsistent with that same community's desire for a reduction in Military Contribution. It was agreed to write to Singapore and inform the Association there not to support the movement. In considering the question of the desire to reduce the Military contributions of the mercantile community, it was noted that the Association in London had done all in its power to secure the attention of Parliament and there would be no opportunity of addressing the House of Commons again until proper estimates were in hand.

The highway is completely in the city limits of Woods Cross, spanning . The entire route is routed along 2600 South. It was formed in 1965 coinciding with the construction of I-15 through the area. At the time of formation, the route at the eastern terminus was legislatively designated SR-106, though it was signed as US-89 and US-91. US-91 was decommissioned in 1974, and the designation of SR-106 changed to the signed route, US-89, in 1977. Route description The highway initially begins at the intersection of 800 West and 2600 South in Woods Cross. From that intersection, SR-93 heads southeast on 2600 South, passing under I-15 at exit 315. The road intersects with a local road and veers northeasterly briefly before straightening out to the east and terminating at US-89.

From this the name of \\"Ka-tok\\" was formed, meaning \\"on top of ka\\". Also called Ka tok Dorje Den, the monastery was built on the rock and is one of Guru Rinpoche's 25 sacred sites in Do Kham. Katok Monastery was founded in 1159 by a younger brother of Phagmo Drupa Dorje Gyalpo, Katok Kadampa Deshek, prophesied by Guru Rinpoche to be an emanation of Yeshe Tsogyal. He built at Derge, the historic seat of the Kingdom of Derge in Kham. The prophesy that 100,000 people would achieve rainbow body at Katok is said to have been realized.

He was a major supporter of James I of Aragon. He began his career as a canon priest in Barcelona Cathedral during the episcopate of his uncle Berenguer de Palou I. Shortly after being elected bishop in 1212, he marched with Peter II of Aragon on the latter‚Äôs crusade against the Almohads in the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa. Later Palou served as royal councilor and chancellor of the Crown of Catalonia-Aragon. In 1219, he participated in the Fifth Crusade against Damietta in Egypt, contributing to the effort 50 knights and peons and unsuccessfully attempted to prevent the Cathar Crusade. He founded various establishments for the destitute, offering the Castle of Avi√±√≥n del Pened√©s and some of his own properties for this effort. He supported the founding of the Mercedarian Order in 1218. Bishop Berenguer de Palou gave Peter Nolasco and his companions the white habit that they would wear as characteristic of the Order; he gave them the Rule of Saint Augustine as a norm for their life in common and he gave his authorization for the sign of his cathedral, the Holy Cross, to be on the habit of the Order. After that, Peter Nolasco and the first Mercedarians made their religious profession before the bishop. In 1219, Bishop Berenguer also supported the introduction into Barcelona of the Dominican and Franciscan Orders. In 1225, he accompanied James I on the unsuccessful attack on Pe√±√≠scola, Valencia. Together they planned the invasion of Majorca, to which he contributed 99 knights and 1,000 foot soldiers. As a reward, he received 875 knighthood lands and 8 windmills, which had originally been the possession of the barony of Andratx. During the military operations against the Muslims of Mallorca, he was wounded, his foot being mutilated during the last campaign against the Muslims of this island. In 1233, he was elected Archbishop of Tarragona, but Pope Gregory IX did not approve the election, and Palou did not occupy this see. In 1237, he helped found the Monastery of Santa Clara in Barcelona.

Approximant         }  Degema history  Oral tradition asserts that the Degema people (originally part of the Engenni people) migrated from Benin (in what is now the Edo State of Nigeria) to Ewu in present-day Engenni, in the Ahoada Local Government Area of Rivers State. According to Mark Roman (a native of Engenni and a staff member at the University of Port Harcourt), the people of present-day Degema settled at Ewu (near Akinima) when they left Benin with other groups who settled at Okilogua in Engenni (not in Akinima, as claimed). Roman asserts that Ewu is also in Okilogua. At Ewu, there was a split which took some of the inhabitants to Enuedua (Joinkrama) (forming the Enuedua group), some to Ediro (forming the Ediro group) and some to Ogua, forming the Ogua group. These groups make up the Engenni community. Roman also asserts that the Degema people belonged to the Ogua group. The split at Ewu was in due to a disagreement over fish belonging to all the people living there. Some of those who contributed their own water to the cooking of fish did not get their share of the water after the cooking was done, not considering that water evaporates when heated. Those aggrieved decided to leave Ewu, and the name Udekaama became associated with the aggrieved group. The Udekaama group went to the uninhabited Degema Island around the 15th century CE and settled at Ipokuma (\\"headland\\" or \\"cape\\" in D·∫πg·∫πma), now known as Doctor‚Äôs Farm. The headland is the part of Degema Island adjacent to an uninhabited island on which Abonnema (a Kalabari-speaking community in the Akuku-Toru Local Government Area of Rivers State is situated. Udekaama is an umbrella term for two groups: Usokun- Degema and Degema Town (Atala) (headed by Ugu and Ekeze, respectively, who led the two groups from Ewu to Ipokuma. Ekomburu (Obonoma) is one of the groups comprising the Udekaama clan.Kari, Ethelbert E. 1995. The structure of the Degema verb. M.A. thesis, University of Port Harcourt.Kari, Ethelbert E. 1997. Degema. Munchen-Newcastle: Lincom Europa. . The settlement at Ipokuma was before the arrival of the Abonnema (about 1882) and the Kalabari tribe: At Ipokuma Ugu and Ekeze led Usokun-Degema and Degema Town, respectively, north to their present sites for fishing, hunting and farming. Neither of these two communities considers itself (or its leader) subordinate to the other; the two groups consider themselves independent. The name Degema is a bastardized form of Udekaama (the name by which colonists referred to the Udekaama people), which may have resulted from the Kalabari mispronunciation of Udekaama as Dekema (which, in turn, became Degema on contemporary documents. Udekaama may also be an unwelcome reminder of the rift between their forefathers at Ewu. Udekaama is still found in official documents, mainly due to the assertion of ethnic identity by the Degema people (who are surrounded by Kalabari-speaking communities). The people of Degema are linguistically and culturally distinct from their Kalabari neighbours (The Kalabari people speak Kalabari, an Eastern ijaw language spoken in the Akuku Toru and Asari-Toru Local Government Areas of Rivers State.Peters, Abel S. 1981. Cases of language maintenance in the Kalabari speech community. B.A. thesis, University of Port Harcourt. Kalabari is also spoken in some parts of the Degema Local Government Area. Degema refers not only to the language spoken by the inhabitants of Usokun-Degema and Degema Town, it also refers to the people themselves, the land on which they live and their government (the administrative headquarters of the Degema Local Government Area).Kari, Ethelbert Emmanuel. 2004.

In general they include units that carry or employ a weapon system, such as infantry, cavalry, and artillery units.Rush 2006, p.11 The use of multiple combat arms in mutually supporting ways is known as combined arms. In some countries, notably the British Army, the artillery units are categorised as combat support. Some armies such as the United States Army, classify combat engineers as a combat arm also, while armoured troops constitute a combat arm in name although many have histories derived from cavalry units.Hofmann 2006, p.333 This is also true for the combat aviation units in many armed forces throughout the world. Artillery is included as a combat arm primarily based on the history of employing cannons in close combat, and later in the anti-tank role until the advent of anti-tank guided missiles. The inclusion of special forces in some armed forces as a separate combat arm is often doctrinal because the troops of special forces units are essentially specialized infantry, often with historical links to ordinary light infantry units. British Commonwealth Forces In some Commonwealth Countries, the combat arms in the Army are: * Infantry * Armoured * Artillery * Combat Engineers * Combat Aviation * Field Air Defence Field Air Defence is considered in the artillery branch in Canada, also all aviation assets are part of the RCAF not the Army United States Army Currently, U.S. Army organizational doctrine uses the classification \\"Maneuver, Fires and Effects\\" (MFE) to group the combat arms branches, and four other branches, into Maneuver, Fires, Maneuver Support, and Special Operations Forces functional areas.UNC Charlotte Army ROTC: Career Path & Branch Homepages, Branches Overview. Retrieved 12 December 2016. The \\"classic\\" combat arms were infantry, artillery, and cavalry, defined as those branches of the army with the primary mission of engaging in armed combat with an enemy force. In the U.S. Army, the following branches were traditionally classified from 1968 until 2001 as the Combat Arms: * Infantry (1775) * Field Artillery (Artillery 1775 / Re- designated Field Artillery 1968) * Air Defense Artillery (Created 1968) * Armor including Armored Cavalry, Light Cavalry,U.S. Army Field Manual FM 3-90: Tactics (dated 4 July 2001), Appendix A: Army Branches and Tactical Echelons, Appendix A: Army Branches and Tactical Echelons, A-2 Combat Arms, Figure A-1.

The Coast Artillery also included the anti-aircraft artillery, from 1920, until its disestablishment in 1950. Anti-aircraft artillery then remained under the Artillery Branch until 1968 when it became a separate branch designated as the Air Defense Artillery Branch and the Artillery Branch was re-designated as the Field Artillery Branch. The Cavalry Branch was officially subsumed by the Armor Branch in 1950, although many units continued to have a \\"cavalry\\" designation. Since 2001, U.S. Army doctrine has included combat aviation, special operations, and combat engineer forces into the combat arms classification.U.S. Army Field Manual, A-4. Aviation, A-5. Engineers, & A-6 Special Operations Forces. Retrieved 12 December 2016. * Army Aviation (e.g., Attack Helicopter and Air Cavalry units) (1983) Until the creation of the Army Aviation Branch in 1983, different branches of the Army were proponent branches for specific aircraft mission/type/model aircraft. For example, UH-1 and UH-60 assault helicopters fell under the Infantry Branch, UH-1 and UH-60 MEDEVAC units were Medical Service Corps, cargo aircraft units, such as the CH-47, CH-54, and CV-2/C-7 belonged to the Transportation Corps, OV-1 airplanes were under the Military Intelligence Corps, AH-1 and AH-64 attack helicopters, as well as OH-6 and OH-58 observation helicopters came under either Armor (for attack helicopter and air cavalry units) or Field Artillery for aerial rocket artillery (ARA) batteries. Only those Army Aviation units directly involved in armed combat such as air cavalry, attack helicopter, aerial rocket artillery, or assault helicopter operations were properly considered as \\"combat arms.\\" Army Aviation, as distinguished from the Army Air Forces (AAF 1941-1947) and its predecessor, the Army Air Corps (AAC 1926-1942), officially began on 6 June 1942 with the authorization for organic liaison airplanes to perform air observation for artillery units. (From 20 June 1941 until 9 March 1942, the AAF and the AAC simultaneously existed as \\"branches\\" of the U.S. Army). From 1942 until 1983, the Army did not have an \\"aviation branch,\\" rather its officers (minus warrant officers) and enlisted personnel were commissioned into basic branches or assigned (for enlisted soldiers) to various branch affiliated units depending upon their specific Military Occupational Specialty (MOS). Commissioned officers (second lieutenant through lieutenant colonel) were usually assigned to aviation units under the proponentcy of their parent branch. This meant that most Infantry officers were assigned to assault helicopter units while Armor and Field Artillery officers were most likely assigned to attack helicopter or aerial rocket artillery units, respectively. Both Infantry and Armor branch commissioned officer aviators were assigned to Air Cavalry units, as these squadrons consisted of troops containing a mix of attack helicopter, aerial reconnaissance, and \\"aero-rifle\\" platoons. Other branches routinely providing commissioned officer aviators were the Medical Service Corps, Military Intelligence Corps, and the Transportation Corps for their own branch- affiliated aviation units. More rarely, there were some officers of the Air Defense Artillery, Corps of Engineers, Ordnance Corps, and Signal Corps rated as Army Aviators and assigned to various Army Aviation units. Until 2004, Army warrant officer (WO) aviators were appointed/commissioned into the Warrant Officer Corps in the Army \\"at large\\" and in a WO MOS in which they were qualified depending upon the aircraft category (i.e., fixed-wing or rotary- wing) and the mission/type/model(s) of aircraft in which they were rated. They were then assigned to Army Aviation units as needed for their specific aircraft qualifications. * Special Forces (1987) From 1952 until 1987, Army Special Forces (SF) were essentially a subset of the Infantry Branch with most of its officers and many of its enlisted soldiers coming from traditional infantry MOS backgrounds, however, in 1987 owing to a heightened emphasis on special operations, SF was established as a combat arms basic branch. * Corps of Engineers (1775) (Combat Engineers 2001) Combat engineer units provide mobility, countermobility, and survivability capabilities to support maneuver units, and have a secondary mission to fight as infantry.U.S. Army Field Manual, A-5: Engineers. 12 December 2016.

It was aired on television in the United States as Just One of the Girls. Plot Summer is over and 16-year-old Chris (Corey Haim), who is constantly bullied, is enrolling in a new high school. Tired of being beaten up, he asks his father to teach him how to fight. The school bullies can still beat him up, however, so he decides that he will disguise himself every day as a girl to walk past them into school. Initially, he only plans on dressing up as a girl to get into school, but he soon grows used to the role of being a female. For instance, he likes being able to talk trash to his chief tormentor, Kurt (Cameron Bancroft), who falls in love with him, and also befriending a girl named Marie (Nicole Eggert), a cheerleader and also Kurt's sister, whom Chris has a crush on. Enthusiastic at the prospect of going to cheerleader camp and sharing a room with Marie, Chris signs up to become a cheerleader. In a short period of time, Chris wins both Marie and Kurt's trust. After Kurt admits to Chris that he is only behaving the way he does because of peer pressure, Chris convinces him to apologize to his friend Dan, who has also been bullied by Kurt and his gang. Problems begin when Kurt starts to make advances towards Chris and he starts almost getting caught. His PE teacher notices he is looking at the girls in the locker room, and thinking Chris is a lesbian, takes him to her office for a conversation. Chris, thinking she is talking to him about actually being a boy, admits his disguise. The PE teacher threatens to tell the principal the truth, but Chris convinces her not to do so by lying that he is a transvestite and enjoys dressing up in women's clothing. Later that evening, Marie visits Chris at home. His parents, unaware that Chris is going to school as a girl, mistake her for his girlfriend. Dealing with Marie and his parents at the same time causes Chris some trouble, but he keeps up his subterfuge. However, when Kurt drops by to bring Chris flowers, his father Louis starts to think he is gay. By lying about Kurt's sexuality, Chris is able to convince his father that he is straight and nothing is wrong. The next day Chris is to leave for cheerleader camp. When Louis finds out, he finally realizes Chris has been dressing up as a girl. Meanwhile, Chris attempts to kiss Marie while practicing their cheerleading choreography, but she pushes him away and runs off. Encouraged by his PE teacher to tell the truth, Chris reveals himself to be a boy during a cheerleading performance. Kurt threatens to beat him up, but when Chris defends him for not being gay, they finally make peace. Marie feels betrayed, thinking that Chris only tried to get her in bed, but she eventually decides to forgive him.

It exhibits sexual dimorphism, with the males having vertical black stripes and the mature females having horizontal black stripes along the sides of their silver-colored bodies. Juvenile females have vertical stripes, however, and one or two vertical stripes remain at the end of the tail even on adult females. Striped killifish typically reach lengths of up to , occasionally .  Tidepool survival techniques  Several striped killifish on land In Feb 1916, Popular Science Monthly had a news article on research being done by Professor S. O. Mast of the zoological department of Johns Hopkins University.Fish that Travel on Land, Popular Science monthly, Feb 1916, page 177, Scanned by Google Books: https://books.google.com/books?id=iSYDAAAAMBAJ&printsec;=frontcover&source;=gbs_summary_r&cad;=0_2#PPA170,M1 The professor was studying the Fundulus majolisis and noted their ability to survive the draining of ocean tide pools. These fish would swim in and out of the tide pools on regular intervals, somehow knowing when to swim out before the tidewaters drained from the pools. If for some reason the outlet of the pool were to close off as the tide went out, the fish would quickly swim around the tide pool randomly looking for an alternate escape route. If the fish cannot find an exit, they actually leave the water and flop over land to reach the ocean. Professor Mast saw scores and scores of these fish leave large tide pools and travel across sand bars up to 12 feet wide and six inches tall. The fish nearly always leave the pool on the side towards the ocean, and are able to travel straight towards the ocean rather than flopping around randomly. At the time it was not known how the fish are able to find the ocean so readily. After about three minutes of becoming trapped in a rapidly disappearing tide pool, a dense aggregation of fish form on the side of the pool towards the ocean, and swim up and down the side of the pool. Then, in groups of about twelve, the fish leave the pool and head across land towards the sea.

J. Juinio and illustrated by Yasufumi Soejima, produced by Animax. The film tells the story of a futuristic inhabited planet that has seemingly perfected a system of justice and imprisonment, called \\"Lamination\\". Individuals convicted of serious crimes are encased in laminated suits, which results in virtual slavery. The criminals are referred to as \\"LaMBs\\". The protagonists struggle with the political and ethical system of laminated imprisonment, leading to the eventual development of a romantic relationship between a free citizen and a LaMB. It is the first Animax original production that provided two different songs for the opening and ending themes of the movie, featuring the music of Simple Plan and The Click Five.  Plot summary  LaMB takes place in the distant future on a desert planet called Cerra. The story features a prison system, in which prisoners are sealed in personal containment systems known as \\"laminated suits\\" and used for labor. Prisoners go through a \\"Lamination\\" process, where they are fitted with cybernetic, laminated skin-tight suits. In these suits, they can move around and completed work assignments that cannot be done by machine or robots. Law-abiding citizens are protected, while the criminals become members of society in a futuristic prison system. This process ensures that convicted criminals remain productive members in a system of virtual slavery. The story encompasses the dichotomy between the theory and practice of a futuristic society's justice system. The lamination process and system of virtual slavery has made both jails and the death penalty obsolete in a world where human ingenuity, creativity, and labor continue to be precious commodities that cannot be replaced by robots or any form of artificial intelligence. The system also sparks off philosophical debates among citizens presenting pros and cons of the ethical feasibility of \\"Lamination\\". The story follows protagonists Sara Integra and Jack Griswold's struggle against Cerra's system of imprisonment. Major Sara Integra is a former weapons specialist in bio-weapons division. While she was on a military assignment, innocent lives were lost during an experiment gone wrong. She was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 200 years encased in a laminated suit. Sara forever became known as Eve, or Eve1135. When she became a LaMB, Eve was assigned a Shepherd. Shepherds control the actions and movement of the LaMBs. Included among the laws of society are that LaMBs must only act upon instructions of their Shepherds. While LaMBs can hear others, they cannot speak, nor can they touch another human being unless ordered by their Shepherd. Dr. Jack Griswold was assigned to be Eve's Shepherd. Griswold is a scientist from another planet, specializing in advanced botanical engineering. He has been assigned the task to restore vegetation to the dry, desert planet. Among Griswold's superiors is Keiko Suzuki, Chief Scientific Advisor specializing in biophysics, and Sara Integra's niece. She has been deeply affected by the death of her parents, and her aunt's imprisonment, and lamination and has made revenge her ultimate goal in life. Griswold tends to display workaholic traits, presumably in order to forget the recent loss of his wife. His curiosity and soul-searching thirst to understand the complexities of the universe drives his research. He tends to spend more time in the lab than anywhere else and his intense focus on his research makes him appear awkward when in comes to social interaction. Griswold inadvertently gets pulled into the politics and ethics behind the system of \\"Lamination\\", as well as a romance with Eve. Keiko's anti-LaMB organization and conspiracy is discovered, and she is put into a lamb suit. Due to recent developments in technology her suit is part plant possibly. She goes on a rampage and tries to destroy Eve1135, but she is immobilized by touching Griswold while she attacked him. She loses her balance and falls off the building. Eve1135 is eventually released from prison (possibly hundreds of years later) and she is just Sara Integra and she kisses Griswold after they put flowers on his wife's grave.  Production LaMB is based on a screenplay originally entitled Laminated Woman: To the Sand Planet Cerra written by Carmelo S. J. Juinio, one of the finalists of the 2007 Animax Awards Pan-Asia Animation competition. Its release was considered by Animax to be an example of the industry potential of user-generated content. The film is Animax's first original production presented in high definition, encompassing a series of multi-platform, multidisciplinary, and multimedia activities that revolve around the launch of the movie. The goal of the film producers had included the desire to redefine the entertainment experience for consumers from premiere to post-premiere of the film. The movie won Best Animation at Taiwan's prestigious 2009's Golden Bell Awards.  Fashion design  Vivienne Tam, a New York based Fashion designer, designed the dresses used by LaMB characters. The designs have been made into real dresses for LaMB based events held across Asia.  Voice actors  * Dr. Jack Griswold voiced by Vanness Wu (in both English and Mandarin versions) * Sara Integra (also known as 'Eve') voiced by Petrina Kow (in the English version) * Keiko Suzuki voiced by Josie Ho (in English and Cantonese versions), Tanaka Chie (in the Mandarin version) LaMB was Wu's first venture into voice acting for animation.

United States, 113 U.S. 568 (1885), was an appeal from the Court of Claims regarding one James Brown, the intestate of the appellant, who was a boatswain in the United States Navy. The petition in this case was filed against the United States by the administratrix of his estate in the Court of Claims to recover a balance of pay which she alleged was due to Brown at his death.Brown v. United States, . The Court of Claims found the following facts: The decedent Brown, was appointed a boatswain in the US Navy, January 4, 1862. On October 22, 1872, the Naval Retiring Board, before which he had been ordered by the Secretary of the Navy under the provisions of ¬ß 23 of the Act of August 3, 1861, 12 Stat. 291, reported that he was incapacitated from performing the duties of his office, and that there was no evidence that such incapacity was the result of any incident of the service. He was accordingly, upon the day last mentioned, by order of the President, retired on furlough pay. From October 22, 1872, to June 30, 1875, Brown received pay at the rate of $900 per annum, and from July 1, 1875, to June 6, 1879, at the rate of $500 per annum. On the day last named, he died. The court also found that the Acts of August 3, 1861, 12 Stat. 290, and of December 21, 1861, 12 Stat. 329, were soon after their enactment construed by the President and Navy Department to include warrant officers, and under that construction it had been the uniform practice of the President to place warrant officers on the retired list, and large numbers of these officers had been so retired. No protest or objection was made by Brown during his lifetime, either to his retirement or rate of pay. The accounting officers of the Treasury had uniformly held that longevity pay to retired officers was not authorized by ¬ß 1593 of the Revised Statutes. From these findings of fact the Court of Claims deduced, as a conclusion of law, that Brown was legally placed on the retired list, and had received the full amount of pay allowed him by law, and was not entitled to recover, and entered judgment dismissing the petition. The appeal of the petitioner brings that judgment under review. The appellant asserted that the law applied only to commissioned officers, and not to warrant officers, to which latter class Brown belonged. The question, however, was not a new one, and the findings showed that soon after the enactment of the act, the President and the Navy Department construed the section to include warrant as well as commissioned officers, and that they have since that time uniformly adhered to that construction, and that under its provisions, large numbers of warrant officers have been retired. This contemporaneous and uniform interpretation is entitled to weight in the construction of the law, and in a case of doubt ought to turn the scale. The appellant next contended that the retirement of Brown was illegal because, at the time of his retirement, no officer could be placed on the retired list for disability not originating in the line of duty. The theory behind this contention is this: the statute required that all officers retired for disability or incompetency not resulting from long and faithful service or wounds or injuries received in the line of duty or from sickness or exposure therein should be retired on furlough pay, and, as ¬ß¬ß 3, 5, and 19 of the Naval Appropriation Act of July 15, 1870, 16 Stat. 321, abolished the furlough pay list, the President was only authorized to retire Brown wholly from the service with one year's pay. The court thought it was clear that the sections of the statute referred to were not intended to abolish the furlough pay list. So far as they refer to retired officers, they apply to the retired list, and not the retired list on furlough pay. For thirty years, the legislation of Congress has divided retired naval officers into two classes. By ¬ß 2 of the Act of February 28, 1855, 10 Stat. 616, the officers on the retired, or, as it was then designated, reserved list were divided into those entitled to receive leave of absence pay and those entitled to receive furlough pay. The distinction between the two classes of retired officers has been preserved down to the present time. By ¬ß 23 of the Act of August 3, 1861, 12 Stat. 290, 291, under which Brown retired, provided that officers incapacitated for active service from long service, wounds, etc., should be placed on the list of retired officers, but those incapacitated from other causes should be retired upon furlough pay. So, by ¬ß 2 of the Act approved July 28, 1866, 14 Stat. 345, it was provided that the rate of pay of officers of the navy on the retired list and not on duty nor retired on furlough pay, should be one-half the pay to which such officers would be entitled if on duty at sea. This legislation has been reproduced in the Revised Statutes, where the distinction between officers on the retired list and officers on the retired list on furlough pay is preserved. Thus, ¬ß¬ß 1588 and 1592 prescribe one rate of pay for retired officers, and ¬ß 1593 a different rate for officers on the retired list on furlough pay, and ¬ß 1594 authorizes the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to transfer any officer of the navy on the retired list from the furlough to the retired pay list. It is plain, therefore, that section 5 of the Act of July 15, 1870, relied on by appellant and which is the only one which refers to the pay of retired officers, applies in both its terms and meaning only to the pay of officers on the retired list, and not to the compensation of officers retired on furlough pay, to which class Brown belonged, and did not abolish the furlough pay list. The order of the President retiring Brown on furlough pay was therefore made strictly in accordance with the provisions of the statute then and still in force. It was next objected that the order of the President retiring Brown was illegal and void because the retiring board, having reported him incapacitated, did not find and report what was the cause of his incapacity, but only that there was no evidence that it was the result of any incident of the service. But as it is incumbent on the officer whose case comes before a retiring board to show, in order to secure a report which will entitle him to be placed on the retired list rather than on the retired list on furlough pay, that his incapacity was the result of some incident of the service, the report of the board that there was no evidence to support such a finding is to all intents and purposes a report that the incapacity was not the result of an incident of the service, and justifies an order retiring the officer on furlough pay. The court's opinion was that the order of the President retiring Brown was authorized by law, and was regular and valid. Appellant next insists that, conceding the retirement of Brown to be valid, he did not receive, after July 1, 1875, the pay to which he was entitled. However, in the court's opinion, Brown was paid in his lifetime all that he was entitled to receive under the laws then in force. The judgment of the Court of Claims dismissing his petition was therefore right, and was affirmed.

Products produced this way often include ceramics, furniture, amplifiers, yachts, boats, leather goods or watches and jewellery among others. In industrial countries, boutique manufacturing is being selected generally for high class goods in upper price levels and only for single products or small batches. Benefits and disadvantages The key advantages of boutique manufacturing in comparison to traditional factory manufacturing with batch fabrication, large or mass production are as follows: * low investment in factory automation * high flexibility during manufacturing * quick alteration of product types produced on every workplace or production line * supports build to order without the necessity of using many pre-assembled components; creation of value caused by assembly takes place mainly at the end of the production flow. * allows an unachieved level of product individualization Consequently, boutique manufacturing closes the gap between piece production and small batch/low volume production. The workflow organization of a boutique manufacturing entity can be a mixture of both ‚Äì elements of jobbing or batch production, however involving higher standardization than the first one. Often boutique manufacturing workshop and factories are organized with single workplaces or production cells carrying out a number of subsequent production steps until completion of certain components or even the whole product. Flexibility and variety of products being able to produce in the entity therefore are much higher than with the more standardized method batch production. However, with this method, manufacturing of larger quantities of unified products is not possible at reasonable costs. Serial fabrication or large production of goods then would be suitable alternative production methods involving higher grades of automation and standardization.

The premise of the essay was that counterinsurgency requires military units to simultaneous execute security operations, train local security forces, promote economic development, and foster political institutions. Ollivant and Chewning argued that conventional military units best operate in such an environment when partnered with indigenous security forces co-located among the target population.Military Review, , July/August, 2006.

In 2008 a review symposium on the FM 3-24 Counterinsurgency Manual sponsored by Perspectives on Politics, Ollivant called for an expansion of irregular warfare doctrine and warned of a potential over reliance on counterinsurgency frameworks in the future. He notes that the absence of a larger framework of warfare tends to pull all instances of irregular war into the counterinsurgency model. This theoretical lacuna presents a difficulty since future conflicts will require peace enforcement, peacekeeping, nation building, and other paradigms to also compete as frameworks for action.Review of FM-3-24 in Perspectives on Politics, , Volume 6, Number 2 (June 2008). In March 2010, Ollivant and Chewning published an article in The American Interest outlining the military, political, and economic actions necessary for a successful US-Iraqi relationship after the US troop withdrawal.The American Interest Other writings Beyond his contributions to military theory, Ollivant wrote a series of articles and book reviews dealing primarily with Catholic political theorists Jacques Maritain and Orestes Brownson, and edited a book of collected essays on the former.

In the , Murphys Creek had a population of 629 people. Geography The locality is located at the foot of the Great Dividing Range. History The locality was originally known as Murphy's Waterhole and Fingal. Peter Murphy was a convict assigned as a servant to Patrick Leslie and accompanied Leslie on his 1841-42 exploration of the Darling Downs. Murphy was highly regarded by Leslie and arranged for the Governor of New South Wales to pardon Murphy. Murphys Creek developed as a railway town on the line between the regional city of Toowoomba and settlements to the east, including Helidon, Ipswich and Brisbane. A railway station in the town was opened in 1867, as a part of the Ipswich-Toowoomba segment of the Southern and Western Railway. Based at the foot of the Great Dividing Range, the station and water tank were intended to provide water and services for steam locomotives about to embark on the difficult journey up the steep slopes of the Toowoomba range. The station was named for a creek that ran through the area, that was in turn named for a shepherd who had built a hut in the area around 1864. A correspondent for the Brisbane Courier newspaper around this time described the site as a \\"feeding place for the engines\\" travelling to and from Toowoomba. Murphy's Creek Post Office opened on 18 May 1868 and closed in 1987. Residents began to lobby for a school in June 1870. Murphy's Creek Provisional School opened on 3 October 1870. In January 1871 it was announced that a state school building and teacher's residence would be erected. The new school building was opened on 1 May 1871 and the school became Murphy's Creek State School. A small town, originally named Fingal, quickly sprang up around the station. The township had grown such an extent that by 1877 tenders had been called for the construction of a booking office and passenger platform at the station. These improvements were completed by 1878. However, in 1887 a fire at the station destroyed the lamp room and ladies' waiting room. In 1917 the station ceased to be used as a watering station for trains travelling up the range, with watering stations being provided elsewhere on the line (although a 40,000 litre emergency water tank was constructed at the station in 1921 for emergency purposes). The township was officially renamed from Fingal to Murphys Creek on 17 January 1924. The need to maintain the Murphys Creek railway station diminished in the second half of the 20th century with the introduction of the diesel-electric locomotive. These new trains were capable of climbing the steep slopes west of Murphys Creek without the requirement for attached locomotives. Steam operations had ceased completely on the line by the mid 1960s, and the station was finally closed in 1992, with the installation of computerised signalling systems removing the last justification for the continued existence of the station. The station buildings were sold to the local progress association in 1993, and the water tank was reassigned to be used as emergency water storage for the township, as well as for use watering the occasional steam heritage trains that periodically ran from Brisbane to Toowoomba. A man and a boy died and many buildings in the town were damaged during the 2010‚Äì11 Queensland floods when flash flooding affected the area on 10 January 2011. In the Murphys Creek had a population of 664 people. Heritage listings Lockyer Creek Railway Bridge from the south-west, 2009 Murphys Creek has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Odin Street: Murphys Creek Railway Complex * Railway Corridor from the end of Murphy's Creek Station to Ruthven Street overbridge, Harlaxton: Main Range Railway * Toowoomba - Helidon Line: Lockyer Creek Railway Bridge Demographics In the , the town was recorded as having a population of 664 persons, living in 150 occupied dwellings. The median age of the population was 38 years, all of whom reported speaking English primarily at home. 65% of the population of the town were born in Australia, 4.2% in England, 1.3% in Zimbabwe, with the remainder being born in New Zealand, the Philippines or the United States of America.

A game backup device, formerly usually called a copier and more recently a flash cartridge, is a device for backing up ROM information from a video game cartridge to a computer file called a ROM image and playing them back on the real hardware. Recently flash cartridges, especially on the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS platforms, only support the latter function; they cannot be used for backing up ROM data. Game backup devices also make it possible to develop homebrew software on video game systems. Game backup devices differ from modchips in that modchips are used in conjunction with systems that use generally available media such as CDs and DVDs, whereas game backup devices are used with systems that use cartridges. Video game companies consider these devices as a tool for reverse engineering to circumvent copying. Most of the devices are made in China, but they are available globally. Recently, action has been taken by companies such as Nintendo to remove these devices from the marketplace, but the easy dissemination of information and selling of products over the Internet has made it difficult to eradicate this problem. Hobbyists argue that these devices are legal and shouldn't be illegal because they fulfill the need to back up bootlegs copy in case the original is illegally sold or lost; and because they permit the private development of new software on the device. In Japan, these devices are known as , an umbrella term for any device that enables piracy on game consoles.  History  Doctor V64 installed in a Nintendo 64. The spiritual forefather of copier devices can be traced back to the Famicom Disk System, an official add-on device for the Japanese version of the Nintendo Entertainment System. Users quickly discovered ways to copy these disks with ordinary home computers of the time and transmit the copied data to others using the emerging electronic bulletin board systems. Nintendo attempted to counter the piracy problem by slightly modifying the hardware in newer revisions, but they were unable to stop the unauthorized copying. Later, the Famicom Disk System was discontinued, supposedly because cartridge technology had caught up in capacity, but the influence of rampant piracy cannot be discounted. When the Super Nintendo Entertainment System was released, Hong Kong based companies were quick to cash in on the same idea. They produced cartridges that fit in the video game console's cartridge slot, but were interfaced with a floppy disk drive through a connecting cable. The copier, as they were called, also had a passthrough slot into which a real game could be inserted. The device, once powered up, could be used to copy the cartridge's ROM data into files on ordinary MS-DOS formatted 3.5\\" floppy disks and thereafter to play the game from the same disks, without having to rely on the original cartridge being present. When these devices were introduced to the United States and Europe, video game enthusiasts quickly started swapping the copied games over bulletin board systems. Release groups formed to cater to the need of fresh games, and also to crack the protection that was employed to thwart copying in several games released after copiers became available. Release groups would also add their own intros to games, to advertise their BBSes and new releases, and sometimes include a trainer to optionally start on later stages or with more lives. The copier devices and dissemination of hardware information through BBSes made it possible to start developing software on the video game consoles. The software evolved from crack intros to demos, and finally to home-made games. The homebrew software development scene is still active on multiple contemporary platforms. Also the availability of such ROM binary dumps allowed the birth of Video game console emulators. Legality Similar to modchips, the legality of these methods is disputed. While they are often advertised for their ability to make legal backups, to be used to play legal homebrew software and are considered a cheap method of development compared to purchasing official development kits, a backup device's potential for software piracy is a major concern to hardware and software manufacturers. Companies such as Nintendo have fought long legal battles against companies like Bung Enterprises and the makers of the R4DS on the grounds that their products are used primarily for piracy and qualify as theft.

A dual solution game copier for both Sega Genesis and SNES. * Double Pro Fighter by China Coach Limited is a dual solution game copier for both Sega Genesis and SNES. * Retrode by Retrode UG is a USB interface for both Sega Genesis and SNES cartridges and controllers. It can be extended via so-called plug-in adapters to accommodate games for other systems as well. It is important to note that no commercially produced Backup Device for Super Nintendo can play back games which use additional processing hardware in the cartridge, with the sole exception of DSP-1. This is due in part to the way in which these processors operate. It may be possible with some copiers to manage to back up a game using an extra coprocessor chip though. A relatively small number of games fall into this category, but there are notable games included, for example Mega Man X2, Mega Man X3, Star Fox, Kirby's Dream Land 3, Super Mario RPG, and Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island. Nintendo 64 There are two devices for the Nintendo 64 that plug into the extension port on the bottom of the system, initially intended for the 64DD: the Doctor V64 and the CD64. In addition to playing backups from a CD, they can both be used to create them by copying the information from a cartridge that is plugged into the Nintendo 64. They store the ROM image in internal memory and can be transferred to a computer via a parallel port for distribution elsewhere. The Z64 uses the cartridge slot on the top of the N64 and has a cartridge slot itself for booting backups as well as making backups. It reads from and stores backups on zip diskettes. The NEO N64 Myth Cart was released in December 2009, long after the Nintendo 64 had been discontinued, and is marketed for retro gamers. The NEO N64 Myth Cart connects to a PC using USB, and ROM images are stored in flash memory. Schematics, PCB designs and source code for a cartridge emulator known as \\"PVBackup\\" were released by Valery Pudov. Modern day devices include the Everdrive 64 and the 64drive. The Everdrive loads ROM images from either USB or from SD card inserted into the top of the cartridge. The 64Drive also uses USB but can also load games from either SD card or compact Flash card. Both units require a CIC chip soldering into the board and the plastic casing from a donor cartridge. Neither unit has the ability to backup cartridges. You can however backup cartridges using a device called Retrode, this is USB powered device that installs itself as a mass storage device in windows, allowing the cartridge information to be backed up. Backup devices for handhelds Game Boy For the original Game Boy and its color successor there are numerous external copiers, such as GB Xchanger, which can back up an inserted Game Boy or Game Boy Color cartridge. The GB Xchanger plugs into a computer in order to copy the games, which can later transfer the game(s) back through the copier to a blank flash cartridge. Game Boy Advance Early copiers for the Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP and Game Boy Micro, like the Flash Advance Xtreme are similar to those used for the original Game Boy, as they are external copiers that use parallel ports to communicate with personal computers. The copiers eventually made use of USB with products like first generation XG-Flash carts, which also used external copiers, but benefited from faster write speeds than its parallel port predecessors. This technology evolved into onboard external copiers like the EZFlash Advance that used the Game Boy Advance itself as a copier. These USB cables would plug into the GBAs proprietary port used for link cables or accessories like the ereader and when booted while holding Start and Select, would connect to a PC. These version are not compatible with the Game Boy Micro because it uses a different port than the GBA and GBA SP. Nintendo DS and 3DS There aren't any commercial backup devices for the Nintendo DS and Nintendo 3DS that are widely available, yet many devices exist to play backups on a DS or 3DS. These flashcarts are capable of using specific software to backup both DS and 3DS or Game Boy Advance games. There is the possibility to create backups using a 3DS with custom Firmware (Both from DS and 3DS) Other Handhelds Bung released a copier for the Neo Geo Pocket and the Neo Geo Pocket Color. It resembled their GB Xchanger and it served the same function. Team Pokeme and Dark Fader both released homemade game backup devices for the Pok√©mon Mini. Both devices used USB for communicating with a PC. A copier for the Japan-only handheld, the Wonderswan, as well as the Wonderswan Color and to a lesser extent, the SwanCrystal, was released called the WonderMagic. It uses a parallel port for communication with a PC.

It extends along North Main Street between Eliot and Everett Streets in Sherborn, Massachusetts, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Sherborn was a sparsely populated town until the time of the American Revolutionary War. The Edward's Plain area, in the south of the district, was probably named for Edward West, who was appointed the local schoolmaster in 1694. Dowse's Corner, at the north end of the district, is named for Ebenezer Dowse, who settled in Sherborn after fleeing Charlestown before the 1775 Battle of Bunker Hill. Dowse became a significant figure in the local industrial pursuits, establishing an early tannery in the buggy lowlands behind his house. Members of the Dowse family built a number of the houses in the area, predominantly Greek Revival houses built c. 1840-60. Dowse's efforts were the beginning of a cottage industry in shoe-making which persisted into the early 20th century. Most of the buildings associated with this and other small industry have either been lost to fire, been converted to residential uses, or moved out of the area. One of the more notable industrial buildings to survive is the only stone building in the district. Nathaniel Partridge in 1796 built a stone structure to house a factory for manufacturing edged tools, which still stands at 53-55 North Main Street, adjacent to the Federal-style Harvey Partridge House at 51 North Main. The Plain School (built 1834) at 60 North Street, is the only building in the district that is not now residential in use.

The English cloth trade had slumped in January, leading to more pressure on agriculture to satisfy export demand. Starvation and high food prices in Essex only exacerbated the strain on the agrarian economy. Discontent was thus harboured when those starving in Essex watched grain being loaded on to ships to be exported to Europe. In March of that year, a 100- to 140-strong group of riotersWalter, 'Grain Riots and Popular Attitudes to the Law: Maldon and the Crisis of 1629', p.53. led by one \\"Captain\\" Ann Carter, the wife of a butcher,Bernard Capp, 'When Gossips Meet', p.317. boarded a Flemish grain ship. There was a widespread belief at the time that women were beyond the law, since any prosecution could only be made against a male who might lie behind a crime; it was commonplace for a husband to be held legally accountable for the actions of his wife (refer to Legal rights of women in history). The women and child rioters removed some grain from the ship by filling their caps and gowns. The local magistracy had been unnerved by the success of the rioting. After a fortnight's delay in trying to prosecute the rioters, the court finally granted a lower purchase price of corn.Walter, 'Grain Riots and Popular Attitudes to the Law: Maldon and the Crisis of 1629', p.59. Rioting caused by high food prices was one of the defining issues of early modern English society, and Maldon was no different. The rioters disputed the price of grain, demanding instead for the just price. For those living at the time, it was believed that prices should only fluctuate within defined limits. This was part of the idea of a moral economy, partly immune from free market forces. Captain Ann, seemingly emboldened by her success, toured the local area drumming up support among clothing workers. The situation came to a head when a further riot took place on 22 May. This was taken much more seriously by the authorities and attracted the attention of the Privy Council.L. J. Reeve, 'Charles I and the Road to Personal Rule', p.131. A special commission was established and Captain Ann was hanged. It was because the second riot posed a threat to the social order that it was so forcibly persecuted by the government. We can set Ann's hanging within its tendency to make vivid examples of what happened to those who posed a serious threat to the harmony of the status quo. The style of Captain was adopted by a number of other activists during the seventeenth century. \\"Captain\\" Dorothy Dawson,Bernard Capp, 'When Gossips Meet', p.316. who organised a protest at Thorpe Moor, and \\"Captain\\" Kate, who was recorded at an election meeting in Coventry,Bernard Capp, 'When Gossips Meet', p.319. are two female examples.

Architectural evidence suggests that this -story frame house has at its core a First Period structure that may date to the early 1670s, making it the oldest building in Sherborn. The property also has a barn dating to the late 18th or early 19th century. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history The Morse‚ÄìBarber House is located on the southeast side of Forest Street in southeaster Sherborn, just west of the Rocky Narrows Reservation and the railroad tracks. The house and accompanying barn are set close to the street, the house sheltered from the road by a fringe of trees. The main house is a -story wood-frame structure, five symmetrically placed bays in width, with a side-gable roof and a large central chimney. The western portion of the structure, a three-bay two-story section that is one room deep, may have been built around 1670 by Joseph Morse, the son of one of Sherborn's first land grant recipients. Morse's home is known to have been the site of the community's first religious services, until a proper meeting house was built in the 1680s. The house, which now has Federal and Greek Revival exterior styling, was in the Barber family from the mid-18th century to the late 19th century. The barn is set northeast of the house and is oriented parallel to the road. It is a large structure, measuring about , with a gable roof and a large sliding door at the center of its main facade. Above this door is an extended multi-light rectangular transom window, with a sash window to the left of the door and another above in the gable. Attached to the building to the right of the door is a single-story equipment shed with two vehicle doors.

Interior courtyard of Casa Ju√°rez Museum. The Museo de la Lealtad Republicana (Museum of the Republican Loyalty), also known as the Museo Casa Ju√°rez, is a 19th-century building in the city centre of Chihuahua, Mexico. It housed the constitutional government of President Benito Ju√°rez during his stay in Chihuahua while Maximilian of Habsburg reigned as Emperor of Mexico, supported by the French, and was thus the de facto National Palace of Mexico. History In 1826 the location was purchased by the state government to serve as the Palace of Government, a role it fulfilled until the new palace was inaugurated in 1892. On October 12, 1864, President Benito Ju√°rez, fleeing from the French invasion, arrived in the city where he established his government-in-exile. Ju√°rez lived in and ran the constitutional government from the palace through December 1866. He left Chihuahua when the French forces and the Second Mexican Empire had been almost totally defeated. After that the building reverted to being the Government Palace for the state administration. However, when the new palace was constructed a few blocks away, the Casa Ju√°rez was turned into an educational institution, first as the Escuela Municipal Nro 3 for girls, redesignated as Escuela Oficial Nro 140, and then renamed Escuela Benito Ju√°rez, a name it retained from 1926 to 1967, when it was closed. In 1972, during the observance of the centenary of the death of Benito Ju√°rez, the authorities decided to turn the building into a museum. Many objects and furniture original to the house had been lost long since; however, the state government was, during the years-long planning stage, able to recover original furnishings as well as period pieces similar to those that Ju√°rez had used. In 2000 the restoration was complete and the renamed Museo de la Lealtad Republicana was opened to the public.

It is located in the Haidian District of northwestern Beijing. The park consist of three connecting lakes covering over a total area of 48 hectares. The lakes' eastern shores consist of several small hills, and they were formed with the earth dredged from the lakes, to balance the natural hills on the western shores of the lakes. There are five bridges connecting the lakes, islands and hills into a single integrated area. To the north of the lakes the Changhe River flows through. Typical of classical Chinese garden style, and like many of Beijing's parks and gardens, it is a mountain-water landscaped garden. Constructed around canals and large lakes, the Bamboo Park is known for its liberal use of verdant bamboo groves. The garden has a variety of bamboos on display, with the variety ranging as much as up to 50 species. There is also an art museum located within the park. The three major lakes in the park were formed in 1159. During Ming Dynasty, the Wanli Emperor built a royal garden on the bank of the lake in 1577, and the bamboo was planted following that. In 1954, the park was rebuilt and open to public. During the 2008 Summer Olympics, it was selected as one of the three protest zones.

Its borders consist of Farm, Sawin, Washington, and North Main streets, Zion's Lane, and the CSX railroad tracks. The district, while predominantly residential in character, also contains an important cluster of civic and religious buildings. Notable among these are the Dowse Memorial Building, a Tudor Revival structure built in 1914 to house the town library; it now houses town offices. It was donated by William Bradford Home Dowse, who also funded the construction of the 1924 Memory Statue, the town's memorial to its war dead. (The library now occupies a modern building on Sanger Street, also located in the district but not contributing to its historic significance.) Two churches stand in the district, both with original construction dates around 1930. The Pilgrim Church at 25 South Main Street was given an Italianate updating in the 1850s, while the First Parish Church at 11 Washington Street has Greek Revival styling. The Town Hall, located at 3 Sanger Street, is a rare unaltered example of the work of Worcester architects Boyden & Ball. It has classic Italianate styling, with deep, bracketed eaves, boldly quoined corners, and a cupola. Only two things in the district survive from the early days of Sherborn, which was incorporated in 1674. Its first cemetery was laid out in 1689, and the older portion of the Flagg House (c. 1740) at 22 Washington Street is the only building in the center that predates 1750.

The district encompasses large, fashionable houses and estates that were built between the 1860s and the 1930s. It includes properties at 245‚Äî834 Andover Street, and at 569 and 579 East Merrimack Street. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. Description and history Andover Street, designated Massachusetts Route 133, is the major roadway extending eastward from downtown Lowell toward Andover in a roughly straight line. To its north, East Merrimack Street also runs east-west, but follows the contours of the Merrimack River, which lies to its north, until it bends south and ends at a junction with Andover Street in far eastern Lowell. At one stretch the two roads are sufficiently close to one another that there are single properties abutting both of them. The district extends along this piece of road, from Andover Street's junction with Nesmith Street to the Tewksbury line. It is lined with generously sized lots, with house often set back . Lot size tend to increase in size further east, reflecting grander properties that were developed later. In the first major phase of the area's growth, between the 1860s and 1890s, Italianate and Queen Anne Victorian houses were built. These were followed from the 1890s the 1930s by a series of high quality Colonial Revival homes. Most of the later properties are of smaller size than the earlier buildings, although the quality of workmanship remained high. The oldest properties in the district are the Federal-style Harry F. Worcester House (658 Andover Street, built 1802) and The Manse at 282 Andover Street, a stone Gothic Revival structure built c. 1847.

The area, roughly bounded by Wyman, Belmont, Fairview, and Nesmith Streets, was developed beginning in the 1850s, and was one of the finest neighborhoods in the city, home to many of its business and civic leaders. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. Description and history Belvidere Hill is the highest point in the city of Lowell. Located on the city's east side, it is one of several glacial drumlin that characterize the city's geography east of the Concord River and south of the Merrimack River. Prior to its residential development, Belvidere Hill was farmland. In 1849, the Proprietors of Locks and Canals purchased land at the top of what was then called Lynde's Hill, and built a reservoir in order to provide water pressure to the city's industries when the power canals were drained for maintenance. Fairmount Road, built to facilitate construction of the reservoir, also became a spur to the hill's residential development. The city's businessmen and political leaders found the hill a desirable place to live, in part because it provided views away from the heavily urbanized parts of the city. The historic district is roughly bounded by Wyman, Belmont, Fairview, and Nesmith Streets. Fairmount Street is the principal spine of the district, running between Mansur Street and Evergreen Road. It also includes portions of Belmont and Nesmith Streets, which parallel Fairmount, and all of Talbot, Fairview, and Summit Streets, which are short streets between Fairmount and Belmont. The earliest houses built in the area are generally Italianate and Second Empire in their styling, and the area's development ended around the turn of the 20th century, when Queen Anne and Colonial Revival styles were fashionable. Lot sizes are generally large (1/2 to 1 acre), and the houses often included a front drive and carriage house in the rear.

It is the oldest known home in Lowell. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. Description and history The Jerathmell Bowers House stands in western Lowell, on the east side of Wood Street north of its junction with Westford Street. It is a 1-1/2 story Cape style house, with a gabled roof, central brick chimney, and clapboarded exterior. It is oriented with the gable end facing the street and the main facade facing south. The facade is five bays wide, with two windows on either side of a central entrance. All of these elements are placed asymmetrically, with the entrance slightly right of center. To the left of the main block is an early 19th-century three-season sunroom, and older ells (of 18th and 19th-century construction) extend to the right and back. The interior of the main block has a typical colonial-era four-room center-chimney layout, with the doorway leading into a narrow vestibule with a winding staircase providing access to the attic level. The exact construction history of the earliest portions of the house is not known with certainty, though architectural details are consistent with an early 19th century date of construction. Jerathmell Bowers, a native of Cambridge, Massachusetts, purchased land in what was then Chelmsford in 1670 or 1671. His son's birth was recorded in Chelmsford in 1673, suggesting that at least part of this house was standing then. Visible architectural details do not support an early date of construction (traditionally 1671), though further investigation of the structure could provide that evidence. By the 1800s, the farm covered about . Jerathmell Bowers was a prominent local citizen, serving as a selectman and militia leader. He also operated a distillery here. During the early colonial period of Chelmsford, it was one of 19 garrison houses used for refuge by citizens during attacks by Native American tribes. The area where the house stands became part of Lowell in the late 1820s, following the early development of mills on the Merrimack River. The house remained in the hands of Bowers descendants at least until the property was listed on the National Register in 1994. In 2013 there was a proposal to tear down the house to make more room for a new commercial building. The entrance to the new building was proposed to be where this house is located. After advocating to keep the house, by the Lowell Heritage Partnership and Lowell Historical Society, the decision was made to save and stabilize the house. In November 2015 it was reported that the developers of the neighboring shopping center are going to start restoring the home in spring 2016.

Built in 1872 for a local businessman, it is one of the most unusual houses in Massachusetts, being a circular masonry building with Second Empire styling. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Description and history The Jonathan Bowers House stands on the east side of Wannalancit Street, a residential street just east of the Pawtucket Canal west of downtown Lowell. It is set at the top of a low rise traversed by the north-south road. It is 2-1/2 stories in height, and is built out of locally quarried granite. It is circular in shape, and is topped by a mansard roof with fish-scale slate shingles. At the center of the roof is a circular cupola with belvedere. The roof is pierced by pedimented gable dormers in a classic Second Empire style, and by a circular chimney. The house was built on land long owned by the Bowers family, but was subdivided for development around 1850. It was built in 1872 by Jonathan Bowers, a local industrialist who owned a sawmill and a granite quarry, as well as an amusement park in nearby Tyngsborough. The materials to build the house (its exterior stonework and interior woodwork) came from Bowers' businesses. Bowers occupied the house until 1879, after which it was owned by a dealer in plumbing and metals. From 1919 to 1924 it was owned by a French-American social club, the Club Lafayette. Returned to private ownership, it has since served mainly as a residence, also housing a small law office for a time. It is one of Lowell's most unusual architectural landmarks.

History  Pearl-Cohn was established in 1983 when Pearl High School and Cohn High School merged to form Pearl Cohn Comprehensive High School. Its campus was built in 1986 to replace the former Cohn High School and Pearl High School. Pearl High School, the predecessor and namesake for Pearl-Cohn, was a traditionally black public school. It was one of two black high schools in Nashville, (rival Cameron High School being the other) with Pearl accepting its first white student in 1971. The original Pearl High School building built in 1937 (a historical site) has been reconfigured as Martin Luther King Magnet at Pearl High School.

Built in 1848, it is a fine example of institutional Greek Revival architecture, and is one of the city's older surviving school buildings, built during the rapid population growth that followed the city's industrialization. Now converted to apartments, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. Description and history The Colburn School is located on the east side of Lawrence Street, between it and the Concord River, in a densely-built residential area south of Lowell's downtown and industrial area. It is a large two story brick structure, rectangular in footprint, with a gable roof with the end facing the street. The gable end is fully pedimented, with modillions in the gable and main cornice. Windows are uniformly spaced, with simple granite sills and lintels. The buildings main entrances were historically on the north and south facades; they are sheltered by late 19th-century porticos, and the northern one is now the primary access. The city of Lowell was incorporated in 1826, originally part of Chelmsford, and was rapidly industrialized, with construction of mills and industrial infrastructure begun in 1822. In the following decades the population grew rapidly, and the city built schools in the neighborhoods to serve the population. The Colburn School was built in 1848, named for Warren Colburn, a superintendent of the Merrimack Manufacturing Company, and originally provided single classrooms for grades 1-3 on the ground floor, and 4-8 on the upper floor. In 1863 it was converted to a fully graded school, and its interior was reconfigured to house eight classrooms. In the 1890s it was also used as a teacher training facility. Lowell's school population began to decline in the 1920s, but the Colburn School remained in use as an elementary school until it was closed in 1992. The building has since been converted to apartments.

The current reservation property, except for a field of boulders, was mostly sheep pasture. When farming interests moved to the Midwest by the late 1800s, the hill gradually reverted to forest. Old stone walls, foundations, and cellar holes are the only remains of the hill's former use. The east side of Petticoat Hill was donated to The Trustees of Reservations in 1906 by Mrs. Edward W. Nash in memory of her husband. Additional land was donated in 1924. Recreation The Petticoat Hill reservation is open to hiking, cross country skiing, picnicking, and hunting (in season); TTOR manages a loop trail through the property. Another trail, Locke's Loop, is managed by the local non-profit Williamsburg Woodland Trails organization with permission from private landowners; it joins the reservation hiking trail near the summit of Scott Hill, passes over the crest, and descends through private property before returning to the reservation.

It is situated on the banks of River Kabul, which divides Jehangira into two union councils and districts. Eastern Jehangira is under Swabi district while western Jehangira is under the administration of Nowshera District.Tehsils & Unions in the District of Swabi - Government of Pakistan  Overview and history  According to the British record of 1870 for land information management in Indo-Pak, Jehangir Khan Awan founded this town in 1681 when Afzal Khan Khattak was the chieftain of Khattak tribe (grandson of Khushal Khan Khattak). In the beginning, it was known as Jehangir village but gradually became famous as Jehangira. In 1818 during Ranjit Singh invasion on Peshawar valley, Sikhs badly ruined Jehangira. But soon after, the Chieftain Abbas Khan Khattak, succeeded in reconciliation with Sikhs, as a result, Khattaks and Awans stopped resistance against Sikhism and returned to their homes with peace. Sikhs built an army post inside Jehangira to control the area and launched boats service across the river to connect the area with Peshawar. During British colonialism, as like their predecessors, they built a check post and police station at the bank of Kabul River and fastened a floating bridge over the river. Since the Pakistan Movement which led to the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the local government of Pakistan has been using the British's check-post as \\"Jehangira Police Station\\" and in 1970 an enforced hollow-core concrete bridge was constructed over the River, known as Jehangira bridge. The bridge first time came under water for few hours on 30 July, during 2010 floods. As the time passed, the village became more populated, most of the adjacent areas overlapped edge to edge, as a result many new markets and industries emerged in the area and Jehangira arose as \\"Jehangira town\\". On July 3, 2005, the North-West Frontier Province government had announced the delimitation of union council Jehangira, which merged it with Nowshera district from Swabi district and renamed it Jehangira-2. Boundaries Wide boundaries of Jehangira town touch the mountains of Khawri behind Jehangira Railway station in the west. The southern shore of Indus river sets the border with (Attock district) Punjab, Pakistan. Tordhair town and Ala Dher Village on the east and village Mian-Esa and Jalbai are located in the North of Jehangira.

Although known for many years, it has not been formally described. There are two different varieties: The most common yellow-tailed Pseudotropheus sp. \\"acei\\" (Msuli), and the white-tailed Pseudotropheus sp. \\"acei\\" (Ngara). Like most Mbuna, it dwells in shallower waters, however it will sometimes go near the surface, which is very uncommon for Mbunas. It is a very common fish for fish-keepers. It gets its common name from its blue body and yellow tail. Originally discovered in 1922 by Regan, the acei was originally believe to be a Pseudotropheus, but was later changed to Gephyrochromis and then back again. It prefers the sandy and rock filled shoreline where sunken logs are easily accessed. This species has developed the advantage of being able to harvest algae from submerged logs and roots. They are equipped with typical Gephyrochromid cuspid-like teeth that are flat for removing epixlyic or epilithic algae from wood. In the lake, schools of 30-50 individuals surrounding a large log are not uncommon, however in the rocky areas; schools usually consist of 3-10 individuals.  Fish- keeping  These mbunas are omnivorous but prefer plants and algae in their diet. If they are to be fed staple, then any food made for African Cichlids will do. Most vegetable matter will work as well. These fish are possibly the most peaceful fish in the Mbuna family, and because of this it is not necessary to have a male to female ratio. Their preferred water conditions are a pH of above 7.5 and a temperature of 78‚Äì82 ¬∞F (26‚Äì28 ¬∞C).  Breeding  Pseudotropheus sp. \\"acei\\" is an ovophile mouth brooder, which means that the female will incubate and hatch the eggs in her buchal pouch, and then continue to hold the fry until the yolk sacs have been consumed. A typical holding period for this cichlid is three weeks, and the female will not eat during this time. Females can have around 50 fry per spawning, although this can greatly vary depending on her size and experience. Once the eggs are done incubating the female spits them out and they are left to fend for themselves.  Anatomy  Acei like most mbunas have a very long intestine so they can live off a few bites of algae a day. These fish are at high risk for Malawi bloat. Bloat is caused by a protozoan that multiplies when a fish is under stress or consuming an improper diet. The protozoans multiply enough that they cause blockages in the intestines, so neither food nor gases can pass, causing them to become bloated. The bloat eventually damages their liver, swim bladder, and kidneys so much that they die in 24‚Äì78 hours. Acei have bicuspid teeth like the rest of the genus Pseudotropheus.

History Antioch High School has a history dating back to 1932. To serve the community of Antioch, the Board of Education purchased a tract of land in southeastern Davidson County and erected a brick school building. In the fall of 1933, the four-year high school formally opened. The first graduating class had 24 students and a faculty of seven. After many years of overcrowding, a larger facility (95 classrooms) was built to replace the old High School and in the fall of 1997 the high school moved to its current location. The new facility opened its doors to a student community of 1,857 and 90 teachers. The old High School building, located at 5050 Blue Hole Road, is now home to Antioch Middle School. According to statistics released in 2011 by MNPS, Antioch High School's student body demographic is 40% African American, 5% White, 45% Hispanic, and 10% Arabic. Also located in the rear of the school is the home of the Antioch High School Alumni Association which occupies the Industrial Art Building. The building contains the history of the original high school. On March 14, 2018, the school received media attention following a walkout for gun control, as a group of students tore down the American flag and repeatedly stomped on it.

It was formerly located in East Harlem, Manhattan, New York City. It was founded by Christina Cox in 1995. Cox opened the first Catholic museum in the United States after receiving a standard https://www.villagevoice.com/2001/06/05/beauty-and-the-big-shots/ blessing from then-Pope John Paul II. The museum has received support from the Archdiocese of New York although there is no connection between the two. Following controversy regarding the museum's status as a charity and its collection of funds, the archdiocese sought unsuccessfully to have the word \\"Catholic\\" removed from the museum's name. The museum's collection aims to cover the many facets of Catholic art, although in 2003 Joseph Berger wrote that it lacked a unifying theme, relying instead on donated works. The museum's original location was in the Olympic Towers on Fifth Avenue, near St. Patrick's Cathedral, a location that allowed the museum to take advantage of Christmas celebrations in the neighborhood. The museum moved several times, including to locations near Radio City Music Hall. In 2002, faced with increasing rents, the museum moved to E. 115th Street, the former home of Our Lady of Mount Carmel Shrine which had recently been spared significant damage from a fire. The museum received around four million dollars in grants from New York State, in the hopes that it would help revitalize East Harlem. The museum was credited with helping to shape and develop the so-called \\"new Harlem\\" that was evolving as a result of increased money and the gentrification of the neighborhood. Following an $8 million renovation, the museum also planned an exhibit on the history of East Harlem, acknowledging the role of the church that housed it in the formerly Italian neighborhood that is now known as Spanish Harlem. The museum announced on 17 May 2010 that it was closing, and hoped to move to Washington, D.C. On January 27, 2012 the museum filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy (liquidation) in the Southern District of New York as case number 12-10331. The Voluntary Petition listed assets of less than $50,000 and liabilities of $1 million to $10 million.National Museum of Catholic Art and History Files Chapter 7.At Crossroads Of Crime And Politics In 2012 the museum began moving to its new location on Massachusetts Avenue in Washington D.C. Since 2011, it has solicited contributions to re-open the museum has not re-opened or announced a date for re-opening. Collections The museum has 11 galleries of art and artifacts, including traveling exhibits and works on art on loan by private collectors. The collection of old masters includes \\"The Betrayal of Christ\\" by Anthony van Dyck. The contemporary galleries have a permanent exhibition called \\"The Morsel \\"(Last Supper) by Paul A. Gatto, \\"The Blue Madonna\\", as well as works by Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg. The museum's Catholic history galleries describe the voyage of Christopher Columbus to the New World, the success of the United States Declaration of Independence in an 8 ft oil painting by Russian-born portrait painter Victor Korolev and his portrait of Archbishop John Carroll.

Stanton, 421 U.S. 7 (1975), is a United States Supreme Court case which struck down Utah's definitions of adulthood as a violation of equal protection: females reached adulthood at 18; males at 21. Background The case had started in Utah state court. A divorced father stopped paying child support for his daughter when she turned eighteen, so the daughter's mother went to court to ask for support until both the daughter and the son reached twenty-one. Utah divorce court ruled against the mother, and the Utah Supreme Court held that there was a \\"reasonable basis\\" for the differential: women matured earlier and married younger; men had a greater need for education. The Utah court stated in its opinion that the basis for the law, though an \\"old notion,\\" was not unconstitutional. Opinion Justice Blackmun wrote for the majority. He found a violation of equal protection and said the law failed under any standard, including rational basis (the Supreme Court's lowest standard of review). The decision remained in the context of child support, without considering different ages for males and females in other contexts. The Stanton decision placed the Court on record as declaring that society's stereotypes were not a legitimate basis for official policies that treated men and women differently. Blackmun wrote: \\"A child, male or female, is still a child... No longer is the female destined solely for the home and the rearing of the family, and only the male for the marketplace and the world of ideas... If a specified age of minority is required for the boy in order to assure him parental support while he attains his education and training, so, too, is it for the girl.\\".

It involved the writ of error regarding a denial of a motion and final judgment rendered perpetually enjoining Chicago Life Ins. Co. from further prosecution of its business. From that judgment, a writ of error was prosecuted to the supreme court of the state, where, among other things, was assigned for error the refusal of the court of original jurisdiction to adjudge that the said statutes of Illinois were in violation of the Constitution of the United States. The judgment of the inferior court was in all things affirmed by the supreme court of the state, and from that judgment of affirmance the present writ of error is prosecuted.Chicago Life Ins. Co. v. Needles, . An Act of the General Assembly of Illinois created a body politic and corporate by the name of the Travelers Insurance Company, with authority to carry on the business of insuring persons against the accidental loss of life or personal injury sustained while traveling by railways, steamers, and other modes of conveyance. Another Act formally accepted by the company, its name was changed to that of the Chicago Life Insurance Company, and was invested with power to make insurance upon the lives of individuals, and of persons connected by marital relations, to those applying for insurance, or in whom the applicant had a pecuniary interest as creditor or otherwise, \\"to secure trusts, grants, annuities, and endowments, and purchase the same in such manner and for such premiums and considerations as the board of directors or executive committee shall direct.\\" A general law of the state, approved March 26, 1869, and which took effect July 1, 1869, entitled \\"An act to organize and regulate the business of life insurance\\" Under the authority conferred by the latter statute, the auditor caused an examination to be made by the chief clerk of the insurance department of the state into the condition of this company. That officer reported that it had been doing a losing business for several years, was insolvent within the meaning of the statute, and that immediate steps should be taken to appoint a receiver, to the end that the affairs of the company be wound up as quickly as possible, as being for the best interests of its policyholders. As the result of that examination, the present proceedings were commenced by the auditor in the Circuit Court of Cook County under the said act of 1874. The petition filed by him shows that in his opinion the condition of the company rendered its further continuance in business hazardous to the insured. He prayed that the company be enjoined from further prosecuting its business; that a receiver be appointed to take charge of its real estate and effects, and that such other relief be granted as should be meet. An injunction was issued and a receiver appointed with authority to take possession of the property of the company, the latter being directed to execute all conveyances necessary to vest in him full title to all its property, assets, and choses in action. The company, by its answer, put the plaintiff on proof of all the material allegations of the petition. At the final hearing, it moved the court, upon written grounds, for a final decree in its behalf; one of which was that the statutes of the state under which these proceedings were had were in violation of the Constitution of the United States in that they impaired the obligation of the contract between the state and the company, as well as of the contracts between the company and its policyholders and creditors. This motion was denied and a final judgment rendered perpetually enjoining the company from further prosecution of its business. The whole argument in behalf of the company proceeds upon the erroneous assumption that this Court has authority to determine whether the facts make a case under the statutes of 1869 and 1874, and if it be found that they did not, that it must enforce the right of the company to continue in business, despite the final judgment to the contrary by the courts of the state which created it, whereas we have only to inquire whether the statutes in question impair the obligation of any contract which the company has with the state or violate any other provision of the national Constitution. Being of opinion that they are not open to any objection of that character, the judgment must be affirmed without any reference to the weight of the evidence upon any issue of fact made by the pleadings. The judgment was affirmed.

It was one of 3 spin-off groups from the League for Physical Culture that had been organized by Kurt Barthel in 1929. Dr. Maurice Parmelee, Professor of Sociology, City College of New York was its honorary President.  History  Katherine and Herman Soshinki arrived in the US in 1923 from Germany as librarians of the New York Public Library. They had become familiar with nudist practice in Germany from 1918‚Äì23. Once in the US they continued their subscription to the German newspapers where they saw the advertisements by Kurt Barthel soliciting German residents to assist in the formation of nudist groups. They joined the group, the League of Physical Culture spending time with others at leased farms in Westchester County in summers and gymnasiums and pools in New York in the winter before organizing the American Gymnosophical Association. Due to the anti-nudity laws in New York they searched for a location which led them to Rock Lodge. Membership soon grew to over 300 and national nudist conventions were held at Rock Lodge Club in 1936, 1938, and 1941. The American Gymnosophical Association statement -Its History, Purposeful Development and Philosophical Outlook- by Katherine and Herman Soshinski circa 1950-collection of Rock Lodge Club Rock Lodge Club compared most favorably with the other camps, not only in the scenic beauties, conveniences, and housing facilities, but with the personnel of the membership body at large, as well as the directors in particular.International Nude-Land Dec 1934 p.30 The group had an office in Manhattan and by 1933 had leased an camp in the foothills of the Catskills and accepted another farm of nearer the city. Miss Ruth Winkler was the secretary of the Association.The Sunday Spartanburg Herald-Journal July 23, 1933 Like other groups interested in nudism, the American Gymnosophical Associates, maintained a well-equipped gymnasium in New York City during the winter months, where calisthenics and other exercises were indulged in under expert guidance. A 1932 painting by artist Richard Ederheimer (1878‚Äì1959) indicating nudist activities at Rock Lodge Club is in the collection of the New Jersey Historical Society. In 1936 looking to expand its operation in the winter months the AGA advertised for a secretary for its new camp Mossy Oaks located in Lake Thonotossa, Tampa, Florida which was, at that time, Tampa's only nudist facility.Sarasota Herald(Fla)3/31/1936The Southeast Missourian 3/30/1936 By 1939 both locations had been approved for National American Sunbathing Association charter, Oakland, NJ.The Nudist Magazine, 1939 The AGA had to discontinue renting country places in Florida in 1943 because of financial difficulties due to World War II. The original AGA logo contained the words mens sana in corpore sano (a healthy mind in a healthy body). In an early AGA publication at Camp Rock Lodge in Stockholm, New Jersey are the statements \\"So perfect a paradise for the practice of nudism has not many parallels in America. It is all ours! The whole lake and miles of winding paths over the mountain-ranges!\\" \\"Back to nature, but not too far back\\".Brochure published by American Gymnosophical Association Rock Lodge, collection of Rock Lodge Club. Rock Lodge Club continues to operate as a non-profit nudist co-operative club at the same location. The AGA was inspired by the idea that nude sunbathing was a healthy way of life. This belief seems to have first gained popularity in Germany in the 1890s following the publication of two influential books, Heinrich Pudor's The Cult Of The Nude and Richard Ungewitter's Die Nacktheit (Nakedness), a utopia of nude living. In the early 1920s while in Germany, Dr. Parmelee researched the movement having read reference to it in a book written by Havelock Ellis on sex and society in 1912. He obtained literature on the subject and then was able to visit and take part in the nudist groups that had formed in Germany. It was during this time he realized he had opportunity to observe and study a significant movement from a psychological and sociological aspect and was encouraged to write a book on social nudism. Back in New York during the winter of 1923‚Äì24 Dr. Parmelee wrote the book The New Gymnosophy the first edition of which was published in 1927 by F.H. Hitchcock, NY with his agreed upon financial assistance. He is the author of the first book on Nudism in the English language. He also wrote a paper entitled \\"Nacktkultur Under National Socialism\\". Dr. Maurice Parmelee, was born in Istanbul, Turkey in 1882. He received doctorate degrees from Yale and Columbia universities and taught Anthropology, Sociology and Economics at the universities of Kansas, Missouri and Minnesota and is the author of over 15 books. In his later years Dr. Parmelee founded the American Gymnosophical Society, an Illinois chartered non-profit, tax exempt organization which published a 4-page brochure entitled \\"Gymnosophy\\". The pamphlet states the society was given affiliation in 1952 with the Societe Internationale de Gymnosophie which itself was founded in 1926 by Kene D'Mongeot in France. In 1952 Dr. Parmelee had retired from government service.  Gymnosophy  Described within AGS pamphlet is \\"What is Gymnosophy?\\": Gymnosophy is a philosophy of Nudism and Natural Living, based on the scientific principals of cultural evolution. Gymnosophy embodies the enjoyment of all of the beneficent aspects of nature of which mankind is in a large part deprived and the utilization of every beneficial product of culture. Gymnosophy endeavors to regain what mankind has lost through civilization without rejecting anything of human, social or cultural value. The enjoyment of nature is an end in itself more than any other human pursuit, and is therefore the most satisfying of pleasures. It has nothing to do with profit, competition and communism or most of the characteristic activities of our civilization. The enjoyment of nature is closely related to the desire for and maintenance of perfect health, which is in itself, the most natural of pursuits. The most intimate and satisfying enjoyment of nature can be attained only when naked, because then there‚Äôs no thing between man and nature and he feels himself wholly a part of nature. When Gymnosophy is practiced by both sexes together it satisfies the normal desire to see the opposite completely, and furnishes the most natural form of human association. Thus the Gymnosophist is encouraged to develop beautiful and physical perfection instead of concealing ugliness with clothes. Gymnosophy is a way of life, aiming at maximum fulfillment through the cultivation of Nudism and Natural Living. It is not a new sect, but the outcome of a long tradition that has inspired many of the world‚Äôs thinkers and creative artists. Class and caste distinctions would disappear to a large extent, as well as many oppressive religious, legal and sartorial restrictions. Gymnosophy would restore to the body the importance and dignity to which it is entitled.‚Äù Adventures in Many Lands, autobiographical memoir of Maurice Parmelee,Manuscripts and Archives, Yale University LibraryBrochure on Gymnosophy published by the American Gymnosophical Society, Manuscripts and Archives, Yale University Library References See also  * Timeline of non-sexual social nudity * Gymnosophists * Naturism Clothing free organizations 1930 establishments in the United States Organizations established in 1930 Naturism in the United States Non-profit organizations based in the United States ","title":"American Gymnosophical Association"},{"id":"18899267","text":"Sylvester Pendleton Clark was the governor of Grand Island, and the founder of Pendleton, New York.

The airport is publicly owned. History Similar to other airfields established in Florida during World War II, the approximate 1,025-acre airport was built by the United States Navy in 1943 (known then as Roseland Satellite Field or Outlying Field Roseland) in support of naval flight training operations at nearby Naval Air Station Vero Beach and Naval Air Station Melbourne. The military paid approximately $1,300 for the property in 1943. Inactivated as a naval facility following the end of World War II, the aviation facility was transferred by the War Assets Administration, as part of the Surplus Property Act of 1944, on January 29, 1959, to the City of Sebastian. Upon taking responsibility, a provision was written in reference to the Federal Surplus Property Act, that the airport would be used without unfair discrimination solely for aviation purposes. This provision provided that the property be given back to the United States in the event of noncompliance with any terms and conditions of the deed.  Operations  Since its acquisition in 1959, Sebastian Municipal Airport (now 620 acres) has been maintained and operated by the City of Sebastian. Since the transfer of ownership from the U.S. Government, Sebastian Municipal Airport has undergone numerous facility changes and improvements. The noted championship Sebastian Municipal Golf Course was built in 1981 on a 155-acre plot of land occupying a large portion of the airport property and local area flight training greatly increased operations at the airport in the mid to late 1980s. Currently, a Fixed Based Operator (FBO) occupies the west side of the airfield, and frequent skydiving activity accounts for a large portion of operations at the airport. The addition of a number of commercial and private general aviation hangars and related aprons were developed along the west quadrant of the field. No identifiable existing structures remain from the airport's days as a naval installation.http://www.sebastianairport.org/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=14&Itemid;=12 References External links Airports in Florida Transportation buildings and structures in Indian River County, Florida 1943 establishments in Florida ","title":"Sebastian Municipal Airport"},{"id":"18899484","text":"Memorial Stadium is a multipurpose stadium located in Alice, Texas, United States.

The publisher is Louise Burke , Mary Matalin was its founding editor-in-chief. Threshold Editions was founded as a Conservative imprint in 2006 with Mary Matalin as editor-in- chief. The imprint was launched after Penguin Books launched Sentinel and Random House launched Crown Forum. Within four years of launching and due to Matalin's network, the imprint had already counted Glenn Beck, Vice President Dick Cheney, and Karl Rove among its authors and was producing bestselling books. The publisher of Threshold Editions, Louise Burke, stated in an interview that Threshold \\"best understands the conservative book-buying audience--a key factor needed to keep the hits coming.\\" Matalin and Burke were introduced in 2005 and Burke said, \\"We were kindred spirits and we took it from there.\\" Of the launch Burke said, \\"This is an area where it really helps to be a believer. I don't feel you can be successful in this particular genre if you are opposed to the message.\\" Glenn Beck's book, An Inconvenient Book, reached No.1 on the New York Times Bestseller in 2007. Karl Rove sold his memoirs, Courage and Consequence: My Life as a Conservative in the Fight, to Threshold in 2007 after an auction with nine bidders, including another one of Simon & Schuster's imprints, Free Press. Rove, who received a seven-figure deal, stated that he chose the imprint as he was a longtime friend of Mary Matalin. While sales of hardcovers were down for Simon & Schuster in 2009 and early 2010, Threshold Editions had the biggest hits for the company. By 2014, Threshold was not only publishing memoirs and political commentary, but also young adult and fiction novels such as Rush Limbaugh's Rush Revere and the Brave Pilgrims. In 2015, Threshold signed a book deal with Donald Trump, for a book originally titled Crippled America: How to Make America Great Again. The title was later changed to Great Again: How to Fix Crippled America. The book debuted at #5 on Publisher's Weekly Frontlist Hardcover Nonfiction list. In late 2016, Threshold signed a controversial deal with Milo Yiannopoulos with a purported advance of for his book Dangerous. The Hollywood Reporter broke the news and social media quickly responded. The Chicago Review of Books announced that they would not be reviewing Simon & Schuster's books in 2017 and others called for a boycott. The book is not scheduled to release until later in 2017, but within 24 hours of the book being announced it had reached number one on the Amazon best-seller list. Simon & Schuster posted a statement on social media on December 30, that stated, \\"We do not and never have condoned discrimination or hate speech in any form. At Simon & Schuster we have always published books by a wide range of authors with greatly varying, and frequently controversial opinions, and appealing to many different audiences of readers. While we are cognizant that many may disagree vehemently with the books we publish we note that the opinions expressed therein belong to our authors, and we do not reflect either a corporate viewpoint or the views of our employees.\\" On January 12, 2017, 160 Simon & Schuster children's book authors and illustrators published a letter to publisher Carolyn Reidy and the leadership at Simon & Schuster about Threshold's decision. The letter first praised Simon & Schuster for which they described as publishing \\"the strongest, most diverse list it can acquire, for the betterment of literature and children everywhere.\\" It then went on to criticize the Threshold Editions imprint and its decision to publish Yiannopoulos's book which would associated Simon & Schuster as a whole with Threshold's decision to \\"legitimize this reprehensible belief system...\\" Authors The imprint's authors include: ; Broadcasters * Glenn Beck * Lou Dobbs * Mike Gallagher * Laura Ingraham * Mark R.

The school is part of Savannah-Chatham County Public Schools, with admission based primarily on the locations of students' homes. History Long known as \\"the pride of the Westside,\\" Groves High School has a rich community tradition that dates back to its founding in 1958. Established to serve the young people and families of West Chatham County, the school is named for Robert W. Groves, a prominent business and civic leader in the county. Besides his powerful role in business and his many commercial and community activities, Groves was concerned with the youth of the area and their educational needs. To that end, he was an avid supporter, both financially and morally, for many programs at the school. Since its inception, some of Groves High School's fondest and best attributes are the strong bonds it shares with the community and its residents. For decades, generations of Chatham County residents have been proud to send their children to this institution. Today, many a Groves Rebel can count him or herself as one whose parents and perhaps even grandparents were once Groves students as well. Many faculty members are also alumni. As of August 13, 2020 the school is being demolished to make way for a new institution accommodating grades k-12.

Several conventional techniques of centrifugation or swim-up. Newly applied methods such as flow cytometry expand the possibilities of sperm sorting and new techniques of sperm sorting are being developed. It can be used to sort out sperm that are most healthy, as well as for determination of more specific traits, such as sex selection in which spermatozoa are separated into X- (female) and Y- (male) chromosome bearing populations based on their difference in DNA content. The resultant 'sex-sorted' spermatozoa are then able to be used in conjunction with other assisted reproductive technologies such as artificial insemination or in-vitro fertilization (IVF) to produce offspring of the desired sex - in farming animals but also in human medical practice.  Methods   Conventional techniques  Several methods have been used to sort sperm before the advent of flow cytometry. Density gradient centrifugation (in a continuous or discontinuous gradient) can concentrate semen samples with low concentration of sperm, using the density of sperm as a measure of their quality. Similarly, so-called swim-up techniques apply a centrifugation step and then sperm is allowed to swim up into a medium, thus enriching a subpopulation of motile sperm. However, use of sperm centrifugation is detrimental to the sperm viability and elicits production of reactive oxygen species. Conventional techniques are routinely used in assisted reproductive technology.  Flow cytometry  Flow cytometry is another method used to sort sperm and adaptations of this technique opens new opportunities in sperm sorting. However, because flow cytometry-based sperm sorting often uses fluorescent dyes that often stain DNA, the safety of this technique in human reproductive medicine is a matter of scientific discussion. However, flow cytometry is the only currently used technique able to determine the sex of future progeny by measuring DNA content of individual sperm cells. It evaluates if they contain the larger X chromosome (giving rise to a female offspring) or smaller Y chromosome (leading to male progeny). It then allows separation of X and Y sperm. The so-called Beltsfield Sperm Sexing Technology was developed by USDA in conjunction with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, relying on the DNA difference between the X- and Y- chromosomes.Garner DL, Seidel GE. History of commercializing sexed semen for cattle. Theriogenology 2008;69: 886-895. Prior to flow cytometric sorting, semen is labeled with a fluorescent dye called Hoechst 33342 which binds to the DNA of each spermatozoon. As the X chromosome is larger (i.e. has more DNA) than the Y chromosome, the \\"female\\" (X-chromosome bearing) spermatozoa will absorb a greater amount of dye than its male (Y-chromosome bearing) counterpart. As a consequence, when exposed to UV light during flow cytometry, X spermatozoa fluoresce brighter than Y- spermatozoa. As the spermatozoa pass through the flow cytometer in single file, each spermatozoon is encased by a single droplet of fluid and assigned an electric charge corresponding to its chromosome status (e.g. X-positive charge, Y-negative charge). The stream of X- and Y- droplets is then separated by means of electrostatic deflection and collected into separate collection tubes for subsequent processing.Seidel GE, Jr., Garner DL. Current status of sexing mammalian spermatozoa. Reproduction 2002;124: 733-743. Another cytometric technique used in sperm sorting is magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) which is routinely applied in assisted reproduction hospitals to sort out sperm with fragmented DNA. This is achieved using antibodies to surface markers of programmed cell death (apoptosis) such as annexin V, coupled with magnetic beads. Following the binding of these antibodies, spermatozoa which undergo apoptosis are sorted by applying magnetic field to the sperm suspension. MACS obviates the need for fluorescent DNA binding molecules.  Other techniques  DNA damage in sperm cells may be detected by using Raman spectroscopy.Ranking sperm cells could improve the odds of in vitro fertilization. By Courtney Humphries. TechnologyReview. Wednesday, January 21, 2009 It is not specific enough to detect individual traits, however. The sperm cells having least DNA damage may subsequently be injected into the egg cell by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Many other methods for sperm sorting have been proposed or are currently tested. To select spermatozoa with low DNA damage index the population of sperm could be enriched with spermatozoa with non-fragmented DNA, with techniques like electrophoresis, Z method and MACS (Magnetic Activating Cell Sorting), which in combination with density gradient centrifugation in single sperm preparation protocols results in spermatozoa with superior quality. Hyaluronic acid (HA) binding sites on the sperm plasma membrane are an indicator of sperm maturity (Huszar et al., 2003, Yudin et al.,1999). There are two methods based on this fact: physiological intracytoplasmic sperm injection (PICSI), and a sperm slow procedure; both methods require sperm preparation via sperm washing or centrifugation.  Applications  Sperm undergoes a process of natural selection when millions of sperm enter vagina but only few reach the egg cell and then only one is usually allowed to fertilize it. The sperm is selected not only by its highest motility but also by other factors such as DNA integrity, production of reactive oxygen species and viability. This selection is largely circumvented in case of in-vitro fertilization which leads to higher incidence of birth defects associated with assisted reproductive techniques. Egg cells are often fertilized by sperm which would have low chance of fertilizing it in natural conditions. Sperm sorting could thus be used to decrease risks associated with assisted reproduction. Additionally, there is ongoing debate about using sperm sorting for choosing the child's sex.  For general health  Conventional methods of sperm sorting have been widely used to assess quality of sperm before subsequent artificial insemination or in-vitro fertilization. It has been verified that sperm sorted using these techniques is of superior quality than unsorted. However, important characteristics of sperm such as DNA integrity remain untested by these conventional methods. New flow-cytometry based techniques such as YO-PRO staining can discriminate apoptotic and dead spermatozoa from the viable ones. For example, annexin V staining followed by MACS can significantly improve pregnancy rates in couples with previous assisted reproduction failure.  For sex selection  = In farming = Sperm sorting by flow cytometry is an established technique in veterinary practice, and in the dairy industry most female cows are artificially inseminated with sorted semen to increase the number of female calves (using sperm sorting is less common in other species of farm animals, however artificial insemination is common). Artificial insemination of farm animals with sorted sperm is recognized by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) as a promising way of increasing efficiency of agriculture needed to produce enough food for the growing human population. Utilizing artificial insemination with sorted sperm is seen as a way to create an optimal ratio of male and female calves to increase dairy milk production. = In humans = Choosing the sex of children might help prevent sex-associated heritable diseases such as Duchene muscular dystrophy or haemophilia in families with a history of these diseases. On the other hand, sperm sorting in humans raises the ethical concerns implicit to the idea of sex selection. If applied large-scale, it has a potential to elicit a sex- ratio imbalance. It could also have implications on gender equality if parents consistently choose to have a boy as their first-born (first-borns were shown to be more likely to succeed in life). During the early to mid-1980s, Glenn Spaulding was the first to sort viable whole human and animal spermatozoa using a flow cytometer, and utilized the sorted motile rabbit sperm for artificial insemination. Subsequently, the first patent application disclosing the method to sort \\"two viable subpopulations enriched for x- or y- sperm\\" was filed in April 1987 as US Application Serial Number 35,986 and later became part of US Patent 5,021,244; and the patent included the discovery of haploid expression (sex-associated membrane proteins, or SAM proteins) and the development of monoclonal antibodies to those proteins.US Patent 5,021,244, column 9, Sorting Sperm; http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph- Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2;=HITOFF&d;=PALL&p;=1&u;=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r;=1&f;=G&l;=50&s1;=5021244.PN.&OS;=PN/5021244&RS;=PN/5021244 Additional applications and methods were added, including antibodies, from 1987 through 1997.US Patent 5,021,244; 5,346,990; 5,369,012; 5,439,362; 5,496,722; 5,648,468; 5,660,997; PCT/US1989/002069 At the time of the patent filing, both Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories and the USDA were only sorting fixed sperm nuclei,L.

In the US, for humans, the application of sperm sorting in sex selection is tightly regulated by the FDA. After the establishment of the MicroSort technique, it was offered to parents as a part of a clinical trial. The procedure was made available to a limited number of participants each month, in addition to fulfilling certain criteria, such as having a disease with sex linkage or having at least one child (for family balancing).Genetics & IVF Institute: MicroSort Clinical Trial There are currently MicroSort laboratories and collaborating physicians in several countries (some for general purposes, some only offering service in case of genetic disease risks associated with one sex). While highly accurate, sperm sorting by flow cytometry will not produce two completely separate populations. That is to say, there will always be some \\"male\\" sperm among the \\"female\\" sperm and vice versa. The exact percentage purity of each population is dependent on the species being sorted and the 'gates' which the operator places around the total population visible to the machine. In general, the larger the DNA difference between the X and Y chromosome of a species, the easier it is to produce a highly pure population. In sheep and cattle, purities for each sex will usually remain above 90% depending on 'gating', while for humans these may be reduced to 90% and 70% for \\"female\\" and \\"male\\" spermatozoa, respectively.

During this ceremony, known as the turning of the bones, people bring forth the bodies of their ancestors from the family crypts, rewrap the corpses in fresh cloth, and rewrite their names on the cloth so they will always be remembered. Then they dance to live music while carrying the corpses over their heads and go around the tomb before returning the corpses to the family tomb. They believe in celebrating the life lived by the dead person.\\"Madagascar's dance with the dead\\" BBC, 16 August 2008. Accessed 17 August 2008. Famadihana appears to be a custom of somewhat recent origin, perhaps only since the 17th century in its present form, although it may be an adaptation of premodern double funeral customs from Southeast Asia. The custom is based upon a belief that the spirits of the dead finally join the world of the ancestors after the body's complete decomposition and appropriate ceremonies, which may take many years. In Madagascar, this became a regular ritual usually once every seven years, and the custom brings together extended families in celebrations of kinship, sometimes even those with troubled relations. The practice of Famadihana is on the decline due to the expense of silk shrouds and belief by some Malagasy that the practice is outdated. Early missionaries discouraged the practice, and Evangelical Christian Malagasy have abandoned the practice in increasing numbers. The Catholic Church, however, no longer objects to the practice, because it regards Famadihana as purely cultural rather than religious. As one Malagasy man explained to the BBC, \\"It's important because it's our way of respecting the dead. It is also a chance for the whole family, from across the country, to come together.\\"http://mywanderlist.com/2013/03/08/worlds-most-bizarre-ceremony- turning-bones-corpses-madagascar-famadihana/ Additionally, the practice of Famadihana thought to be connected to pneumonic plague transmission in the region. The Malagsy government has issued rulings forbidding the practice for individuals who died of plague, but there have been reports of people ignoring this decree.https://www.livescience.com/60783-dancing-with-dead-madagascar- plague.html References *Dead Join the Living in a Family Celebration Malagasy culture Malagasy words and phrases Death customs ","title":"Famadihana"},{"id":"18899726","text":"Kesho Yvonne Scott (born 1953) is associate professor of American Studies and Sociology at Grinnell College.

Additionally, television commercials and advertisements claim an \\"improved\\" or \\"arousing\\" sexual experience. Extenze paid $6 million to settle a class-action false advertising lawsuit in 2010. Websites selling the product make several more detailed claims, including acquiring a \\"larger penis\\". Their enlarging effects are described as \\"temporary\\" while under the use of Extenze. Early infomercials featured a studio audience and porn star Ron Jeremy. Former Dallas Cowboys and Miami Hurricanes head coach Jimmy Johnson has also appeared in an ExtenZe commercial. ExtenZe makes pills and 2-ounce shots that are sold in over 75,000 retail stores. The product is manufactured by BIOTAB Nutraceuticals, Inc., and marketed by Maximizer Health Products. False advertising and side effects A class action was settled in 2010 for $6 million without the company admitting any wrongdoing to resolve plaintiff claims that Extenze maker Biotab Nutraceuticals, Inc engaged in deceptive marketing (advertising, labeling, promotion, etc.) by claiming it enlarged a man's penis despite the lack of any credible scientific evidence supporting that claim. In 2006, ExtenZe agreed to pay the Orange County, California, district attorney's office $300,000 in civil penalties for unfair business practices and false advertising. Susan Kang Schroeder of the DA's office said the company could not back up its claim that the pills caused users' penises to grow 27%. After several customers in Laguna Beach, California complained to the Better Business Bureau that ExtenZe was making them sick, the district attorney investigated. Extenze's side effects are possibly associated with yohimbe extract. Potential side effects include increased body temperature, increased blood pressure, sweating, increased heart rate, nausea, and upset stomach. Other side effects can include aggression, pounding heart, restlessness, fever, feeling like fainting, hallucinations, muscle twitches or spasms, abnormal behavior, severe headache, bruising easily, shortness of breath, blurred vision, seizures, ringing in the ears, chest pain, confusion, loss of appetite, weight loss, vomiting, insomnia, mild skin rash, nervousness, cold feeling in the feet or hands, tingling or numbness in the feet or hands, and difficulty staying asleep. Individuals who are on prescription medication or who suffer from various medical conditions are recommended to consult a medical care provider before consuming ExtenZe. Also, if side effects are experienced, one is advised to interrupt taking the pills and visit a doctor. In 2018, Extenze came under scrutiny of the FDA as a certain production lot of Extenze Plus was found to contain sildenafil, which is the active ingredient in Viagra. https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/MedicationHealthFraud/ucm619167.htm Sports Doping Both professional football and Olympic athletes are banned from taking ExtenZe because the DHEA in ExtenZe is considered a performance enhancer. To date Viagra has not been banned by these sports agencies. In 2010, 400-meter Olympic gold medalist LaShawn Merritt was banned from competition for taking ExtenZe, which contains dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a steroid that is banned in athletic competition. Merritt apologized, saying that he did not realize that the formulation contained DHEA. Merritt provisionally accepted a two-year ban from competition, although he announced plans to appeal. Sports authorities, however, were not sympathetic: \\"Any professional athlete in this sport knows that they are solely responsible for anything that goes into their bodies. For Mr. Merritt to claim inadvertent use of a banned substance due to the ingestion of over-the-counter supplements brings shame to himself and his teammates. Thanks to his selfish actions, he has done damage to our efforts to fight the plague of performance-enhancing drugs in our sport,\\" USA Track and Field CEO Doug Logan said in a press release. Late in 2011, however, his ban ended and he was cleared to compete in the 2012 Olympics. Sponsorship ExtenZe sponsored 2010 NASCAR Rookie of the Year Kevin Conway in both NASCAR Cup Series and NASCAR Nationwide Series from 2009 to 2011. ExtenZe faced legal actions by both of Conway's Cup Series teams in 2010, Front Row Motorsports and Robby Gordon Motorsports, after ExtenZe allegedly paid neither team's sponsorship money. Ingredients It has been reported that the product website lists DHEA as an ingredient. The following ingredients comprise ExtenZe, as reported on the images of labels on vendor websites: * Folate (folic acid) * Zinc (as oxide) * Micronized DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) * Pregnanolone (3Œ≤-hydroxypregn-5-en-20-one) * Black pepper (seed) * Piper longum (seed) * Ginger (root) * Yohimbe extract (bark) * Tribulus terrestris extract (aerial part and fruit) * Korean ginseng extract (root) * Cnidium monnieri (seed) * Eleutherococcus extract (root) standardized to .8% eleuthrosides * Xanthroparmelia scarbosa (aerial part) * Œ≥-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) * Velvet deer antler * Horny goat weed (leaf) * Damiana (leaf) * Muira puama extract (stem) * Pumpkin (seed) * Stinging nettle (root) * Astragalus (root) * Licorice extract (root) * L-arginine hydrochloride * Ho Shou Wu extract (root) * Boron (as chelate) * Other ingredients include dicalcium phosphate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, stearic acid, film coating (dextrin), titanium dioxide, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, Brilliant Blue FCF, aluminum lake, Macrogol/PEG 8000, dextrose monohydrate, lecithin, maltodextrin, Macrogol/PEG 400, magnesium stearate, and silica.

She also had an active directing, acting, and speaking career. She is best known for her books, including her series of seven autobiographies, starting with the critically acclaimed I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1969). Angelou's autobiographies are distinct in style and narration, and \\"stretch over time and place\\", from Arkansas to Africa and back to the US. They take place from the beginnings of World War II to the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. Angelou wrote collections of essays, including Wouldn't Take Nothing for My Journey Now (1993) and Even the Stars Look Lonesome (1997), which writer Hilton Als called her \\"wisdom books\\" and \\"homilies strung together with autobiographical texts\\". Angelou used the same editor throughout her writing career, Robert Loomis, an executive editor at Random House, until he retired in 2011. Angelou said regarding Loomis: \\"We have a relationship that's kind of famous among publishers.\\" She was one of the most honored writers of her generation, earning an extended list of honors and awards, as well as more than 30 honorary degrees. She was a prolific writer of poetry; her volume Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie (1971) was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize, and she was chosen by President Bill Clinton to recite her poem \\"On the Pulse of Morning\\" during his inauguration in 1993. Angelou's successful acting career included roles in numerous plays, films, and television programs, such as in the television mini-series Roots in 1977. Her screenplay Georgia, Georgia (1972) was the first original script by a black woman to be produced. and she was the first African-American woman to direct a major motion picture, Down in the Delta, in 1998. Since the 1990s, Angelou participated in the lecture circuit, which she continued into her eighties.

Its use was lost for centuries until Qin Jiushao (c. 1202-1261) revived it in his Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections of 1247, providing constructive proof for it. * Circadian rhythm in humans: The observation of a circadian or diurnal process in humans is mentioned in Chinese medical texts dated to around the 13th century, including the Noon and Midnight Manual and the Mnemonic Rhyme to Aid in the Selection of Acu-points According to the Diurnal Cycle, the Day of the Month and the Season of the Year. * Decimal fractions: decimal fractions were used in Chinese mathematics by the 1st century AD, as evidenced by The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, while they appear in the works of Arabic mathematics by the 11th century (however it is like it was independently developed) and in European mathematics by the 12th century, although the decimal point was not used until the work of Francesco Pellos in 1492 and not clarified until the 1585 publication of Flemish mathematician Simon Stevin (1548-1620).Needham (1986), Volume 3, 89. * Diabetes, recognition and treatment of: The Huangdi Neijing compiled by the 2nd century BC during the Han Dynasty identified diabetes as a disease suffered by those who had made an excessive habit of eating sweet and fatty foods, while the Old and New Tried and Tested Prescriptions written by the Tang Dynasty physician Zhen Quan (died 643) was the first known book to mention an excess of sugar in the urine of diabetic patients.Medvei (1993), 49. bronze bell of Marquis Yi of Zeng (433 BC) bears an inscription describing the specific note it plays, its position on a 12-note scale, and how this scale differed from scales used by other Chinese states of the time; before this discovery in 1978, the oldest known surviving Chinese tuning set came from a 3rd-century BC text (which alleges was written by Guan Zhong, d. 645 BC) with five tones and additions or subtractions of ‚Öì of successive tone values which produce the rising fourths and falling fifths of Pythagorean tuning.McClain and Ming (1979), 206. * Equal temperament: During the Han Dynasty (202 BC-220 AD), the music theorist and mathematician Jing Fang (78-37 BC) extended the 12 tones found in the 2nd century BC Huainanzi to 60.McClain and Ming (1979), 207-208. While generating his 60-divisional tuning, he discovered that 53 just fifths is approximate to 31 octaves, calculating the difference at \\\\tfrac{177147}{176776}; this was exactly the same value for 53 equal temperament calculated by the German mathematician Nicholas Mercator (c. 1620-1687) as 353/284, a value known as Mercator's Comma.McClain and Ming (1979), 212.Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 1, 218-219. The Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) music theorist Zhu Zaiyu (1536-1611) elaborated in three separate works beginning in 1584 the tuning system of equal temperament. In an unusual event in music theory's history, the Flemish mathematician Simon Stevin (1548-1620) discovered the mathematical formula for equal temperament at roughly the same tim, yet he did not publish his work and it remained unknown until 1884 (whereas the Harmonie Universelle written in 1636 by Marin Mersenne is considered the first publication in Europe outlining equal temperament); therefore, it is debatable who discovered equal temperament first, Zhu or Stevin.Kuttner (1975), 166-168.Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 1, 227-228. In order to obtain equal intervals, Zhu divided the octave (each octave with a ratio of 1:2, which can also be expressed as 1:212/12) into twelve equal semitones while each length was divided by the 12th root of 2.Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 1, 223. He did not simply divide the string into twelve equal parts (i.e. 11/12, 10/12, 9/12, etc.) since this would give unequal temperament; instead, he altered the ratio of each semitone by an equal amount (i.e. 1:2 11/12, 1:210/12, 1:29/12, etc.) and determined the exact length of the string by dividing it by (same as 21/12). * Gaussian elimination: First published in the West by Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) in 1826, the algorithm for solving linear equations known as Gaussian elimination is named after this Hanoverian mathematician, yet it was first expressed as the Array Rule in the Chinese Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, written at most by 179 AD during the Han Dynasty (202 BC-220 AD) and commented on by the 3rd century mathematician Liu Hui.Needham (1986), Volume 3, 24-25, 121.Shen, Crossley, and Lun (1999), 388.Straffin (1998), 166. Aware of underground minerals associated with certain plants by at least the 5th century BC, the Chinese extracted trace elements of copper from Oxalis corniculata, pictured here, as written in the 1421 text Precious Secrets of the Realm of the King of Xin. Bamboo and rocks by Li Kan (1244-1320); using evidence of fossilized bamboo found in a dry northern climate zone, Shen Kuo hypothesized that climates naturally shifted geographically over time. * Geomorphology: In his Dream Pool Essays of 1088, Shen Kuo (1031-1095) wrote about a landslide (near modern Yan'an) where petrified bamboos were discovered in a preserved state underground, in the dry northern climate zone of Shanbei, Shaanxi; Shen reasoned that since bamboo was known only to grow in damp and humid conditions, the climate of this northern region must have been different in the very distant past, postulating that climate change occurred over time.Chan, Clancey, Loy (2002), 15.Needham (1986), Volume 3, 614. Shen also advocated a hypothesis in line with geomorphology after he observed a stratum of marine fossils running in a horizontal span across a cliff of the Taihang Mountains, leading him to believe that it was once the location of an ancient shoreline that had shifted hundreds of km (mi) east over time (due to deposition of silt and other factors).Sivin (1995), III, 23.Needham (1986), Volume 3, 603-604, 618. * Greatest Common Divisor: Rudolff gave in his text Kunstliche Rechnung, 1526 the rule for finding the greatest common divisor of two integers, which is to divide the larger by the smaller. If there is a remainder, divide the former divisor by this, and so on;. This is just the Mutual Subtraction Algorithm as found in the Rule for Reduction of Fractions, Chapter 1, of The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art Kangsheng Shen, John Crossley, Anthony W.-C. Lun (1999): \\"Nine Chapters of Mathematical Art\\", Oxford University Press, pp.33-37 * Grid reference: Although professional map-making and use of the grid had existed in China before, the Chinese cartographer and geographer Pei Xiu of the Three Kingdoms period was the first to mention a plotted geometrical grid reference and graduated scale displayed on the surface of maps to gain greater accuracy in the estimated distance between different locations.Needham, Volume 3, 106-107.Needham, Volume 3, 538-540. Historian Howard Nelson asserts that there is ample written evidence that Pei Xiu derived the idea of the grid reference from the map of Zhang Heng (78-139 CE), a polymath inventor and statesman of the Eastern Han dynasty.Nelson, 359. * Irrational Numbers: Although irrational numbers were first discovered by the Pythagorean Hippasus, the ancient Chinese never had the philosophical difficulties that the ancient Greeks had with irrational numbers such as the square root of 2. Simon Stevin (1548-1620) considered irrational numbers are numbers that can be continuously approximated by rationals. Li Hui in his comments on the Nine Chapters of Mathematical Art show he had the same understanding of irrationals. As early as the third century Liu knew how to get an approximation to an irrational with any required precision when extracting a square root, based on his comment on 'the Rule for Extracting the Square Root', and his comment on 'the Rule for Extracting the Cube Root'. The ancient Chinese did not differentiate between rational and irrational numbers, and simply calculated irrational numbers to the required degree of precision. Shen, pp.27, 36-37 * Jia Xian triangle: This triangle was the same as Pascal's Triangle, discovered by Jia Xian in the first half of the 11th century, about six centuries before Pascal. Jia Xian used it as a tool for extracting square and cubic roots. The original book by Jia Xian titled Shi Suo Suan Shu was lost; however, Jia's method was expounded in detail by Yang Hui, who explicitly acknowledged his source: \\"My method of finding square and cubic roots was based on the Jia Xian method in Shi Suo Suan Shu.\\"Wu Wenjun chief ed, The Grand Series of History of Chinese Mathematics Vol 5 Part 2, chapter 1, Jia Xian A page from the Yongle Encyclopedia preserved this historic fact. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi tends to a leper; the Chinese were the first to describe the symptoms of leprosy. * Leprosy, first description of its symptoms: The Feng zhen shi Â∞ÅË®∫Âºè (Models for sealing and investigating), written between 266 and 246 BC in the State of Qin during the Warring States period (403-221 BC), is the earliest known text which describes the symptoms of leprosy, termed under the generic word li Áôò (for skin disorders).McLeod & Yates (1981), 152-153 & footnote 147. This text mentioned the destruction of the nasal septum in those suffering from leprosy (an observation that would not be made outside of China until the writings of Avicenna in the 11th century), and according to Katrina McLeod and Robin Yates it also stated lepers suffered from \\"swelling of the eyebrows, loss of hair, absorption of nasal cartilage, affliction of knees and elbows, difficult and hoarse respiration, as well as anaesthesia.\\" Leprosy was not described in the West until the writings of the Roman authors Aulus Cornelius Celsus (25 BC - 37 AD) and Pliny the Elder (23-79 AD). Although it is alleged that the Indian Sushruta Samhita, which describes leprosy,Aufderheide et al., (1998), 148. is dated to the 6th century BC, India's earliest written script (besides the then long extinct Indus script)‚Äîthe BrƒÅhmƒ´ script‚Äîis thought to have been created no earlier than the 3rd century BC.Salomon (1998), 12-13. Iron plate with an order 6 magic square in Eastern Arabic numerals from China, dating to the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368). * Li Shanlan's Summation Formulae: discovered by the mathematician Li Shanlan in 1867. * Liu Hui's œÄ algorithm: Liu Hui's œÄ algorithm was invented by Liu Hui (fl. 3rd century), a mathematician of Wei Kingdom. *Magic squares: The earliest magic square is the Lo Shu square, dating to 4th century BCE China. The square was viewed as mystical, and according to Chinese mythology, \\"was first seen by Emperor Yu.\\" * Map scaling: The foundations for quantitative map scaling goes back to ancient China with textual evidence that the idea of map scaling was understood by the second century BC. Ancient Chinese surveyors and cartographers had ample technical resources used to produce maps such as counting rods, carpenter's square's, plumb lines, compasses for drawing circles, and sighting tubes for measuring inclination. Reference frames postulating a nascent coordinate system for identifying locations were hinted by ancient Chinese astronomers that divided the sky into various sectors or lunar lodges. The Chinese cartographer and geographer Pei Xiu of the Three Kingdoms period created a set of large-area maps that were drawn to scale. He produced a set of principles that stressed the importance of consistent scaling, directional measurements, and adjustments in land measurements in the terrain that was being mapped. * Negative numbers, symbols for and use of: in the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art compiled during the Han Dynasty (202 BC-220 AD) by 179 AD and commented on by Liu Hui (fl. 3rd century) in 263, negative numbers appear as rod numerals in a slanted position.Needham (1986), Volume 3, 91. Negative numbers represented as black rods and positive numbers as red rods in the Chinese counting rods system perhaps existed as far back as the 2nd century BC during the Western Han, while it was an established practice in Chinese algebra during the Song dynasty (960-1279 AD).Needham (1986), Volume 3, 90-91. Negative numbers denoted by a \\"+\\" sign also appear in the ancient Bakhshali manuscript of India, yet scholars disagree as to when it was compiled, giving a collective range of 200 to 600 AD.Teresi (2002), 65-66. Negative numbers were known in India certainly by about 630 AD, when the mathematician Brahmagupta (598-668) used them.Needham (1986), Volume 3, 90. Negative numbers were first used in Europe by the Greek mathematician Diophantus (fl. 3rd century) in about 275 AD, yet were considered an absurd concept in Western mathematics until The Great Art written in 1545 by the Italian mathematician Girolamo Cardano (1501-1576). * Pi calculated as \\\\tfrac{355}{113}: The ancient Egyptians, Babylonians, Indians, and Greeks had long made approximations for œÄ by the time the Chinese mathematician and astronomer Liu Xin (c. 46 BC-23 AD) improved the old Chinese approximation of simply 3 as œÄ to 3.1547 as œÄ (with evidence on vessels dating to the Wang Mang reign period, 9-23 AD, of other approximations of 3.1590, 3.1497, and 3.1679).Neehdam (1986), Volume 3, 99-100. Next, Zhang Heng (78-139 AD) made two approximations for œÄ, by proportioning the celestial circle to the diameter of the earth as \\\\tfrac{736}{232} = 3.1724 and using (after a long algorithm) the square root of 10, or 3.162.Berggren, Borwein & Borwein (2004), 27Arndt and Haenel (2001), 177Wilson (2001), 16. In his commentary on the Han Dynasty mathematical work The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, Liu Hui (fl. 3rd century) used various algorithms to render multiple approximations for pi at 3.142704, 3.1428, and 3.14159.Needham (1986), Volume 3, 100-101. Finally, the mathematician and astronomer Zu Chongzhi (429-500) approximated pi to an even greater degree of accuracy, rendering it \\\\tfrac{355}{113}, a value known in Chinese as Mil√º (\\"detailed ratio\\").Berggren, Borwein & Borwein (2004), 24-26. This was the best rational approximation for pi with a denominator of up to four digits; the next rational number is \\\\tfrac{52163}{16604}, which is the best rational approximation. Zu ultimately determined the value for œÄ to be between 3.1415926 and 3.1415927.Berggren, Borwein & Borwein (2004), 26. Zu's approximation was the most accurate in the world, and would not be achieved elsewhere for another millennium,Berggren, Borwein & Borwein (2004), 20. until Madhava of SangamagramaGupta (1975), B45-B48 and Jamshƒ´d al-KƒÅshƒ´Berggren, Borwein, & Borwein (2004), 24. in the early 15th century. With the description in Han Ying's written work of 135 BC (Han Dynasty), the Chinese were the first to observe that snowflakes had a hexagonal structure. Oiled garments left in the tomb of Emperor Zhenzong of Song (r. 997-1022), pictured here in this portrait, caught fire seemingly at random, a case which a 13th-century author related back to the spontaneous combustion described by Zhang Hua (232-300) around 290 AD * True north, concept of: The Song Dynasty (960-1279) official Shen Kuo (1031-1095), alongside his colleague Wei Pu, improved the orifice width of the sighting tube to make nightly accurate records of the paths of the moon, stars, and planets in the night sky, for a continuum of five years.Sivin (1995), III, 17-18. By doing so, Shen fixed the outdated position of the pole star, which had shifted over the centuries since the time Zu Geng (fl. 5th century) had plotted it; this was due to the precession of the Earth's rotational axis.Sivin (1995), III, 22.Needham (1986), Volume 3, 278. When making the first known experiments with a magnetic compass, Shen Kuo wrote that the needle always pointed slightly east rather than due south, an angle he measured which is now known as magnetic declination, and wrote that the compass needle in fact pointed towards the magnetic north pole instead of true north (indicated by the current pole star); this was a critical step in the history of accurate navigation with a compass.Sivin (1995), III, 21-22.Elisseeff (2000), 296.Hsu (1988), 102.  Modern era  * Arteminisinin, anti-malarial treatment: The antimalarial drug of compound artemisinin found in Artemisia annua, the latter being a plant long used in traditional Chinese medicine, was discovered in 1972 by Chinese scientists in the People's Republic led by Tu Youyou and has been used to treat multi-drug resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Artemisinin remains the most effective treatment for malaria today and has saved millions of lives and is yielded one of the greatest drug discoveries in modern medicine. * Chen's theorem: Chen's theorem states that every sufficiently large even number can be written as the sum of either two primes, or a prime and a semiprime, and was first proven by Chen Jingrun in 1966, with further details of the proof in 1973. * Chen prime: A prime number p is called a Chen prime if p + 2 is either a prime or a product of two primes (also called a semiprime). The even number 2p + 2 therefore satisfies Chen's theorem.The Chen primes are named after Chen Jingrun, who proved in 1966 that there are infinitely many such primes. This result would also follow from the truth of the twin prime conjecture.Chen, J. R. (1966). \\"On the representation of a large even integer as the sum of a prime and the product of at most two primes\\". Kexue Tongbao 17: 385‚Äì386. * Cheng's eigenvalue comparison theorem: Cheng's theorem was introduced in 1975 by Hong Kong mathematician Shiu-Yuen Cheng. It states in general terms that when a domain is large, the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of its Laplace‚ÄìBeltrami operator is small. This general characterization is not precise, in part because the notion of \\"size\\" of the domain must also account for its curvature. * Chern class: Chern classes are characteristic classes in mathematics first introduced by Shiing-Shen Chern in 1946. * Chow's moving lemma: In algebraic geometry, Chow's moving lemma, named after Wei-Liang Chow, states: given algebraic cycles Y, Z on a nonsingular quasi-projective variety X, there is another algebraic cycle Z' on X such that Z' is rationally equivalent to Z and Y and Z' intersect properly. The lemma is one of key ingredients in developing the intersection theory, as it is used to show the uniqueness of the theory. * Culturing Chlamydia trachomatis bacteria: Chlamydia trachomatis agent was first cultured in the yolk sacs of eggs by Chinese scientists in 1957 S Darougar, B R Jones, J R Kimptin, J D Vaughan- Jackson, and E M Dunlop. Chlamydial infection. Advances in the diagnostic isolation of Chlamydia, including TRIC agent, from the eye, genital tract, and rectum.

J Hyg Epidemiol Microbiol Immunol. 1957;1(2):109-20 * Feathered theropods: The first feathered dinosaur outside of Avialae, Sinosauropteryx, meaning \\"Chinese reptilian wing,\\" was discovered in the Yixian Formation by Chinese paleontologists in 1996. The discovery is seen as evidence that dinosaurs originated from birds, a theory proposed and supported decades earlier by paleontologists like Gerhard Heilmann and John Ostrom, but \\"no true dinosaur had been found exhibiting down or feathers until the Chinese specimen came to light.\\" The dinosaur was covered in what are dubbed 'protofeathers' and considered to be homologous with the more advanced feathers of birds, although some scientists disagree with this assessment. * Finite element method: In numerical analysis, the finite element method is a technique for finding approximate solutions to systems of partial differential equations. The FEM was developed in the West by Alexander Hrennikoff and Richard Courant, and independently in China by Feng Kang. * Grunwald‚ÄìWang theorem: In algebraic number theory, the Grunwald‚ÄìWang theorem states that‚Äîexcept in some precisely defined cases‚Äîan element x in a number field K is an nth power in K if it is an nth power in the completion K_{\\\\mathfrak{p}} for almost all (i.e. all but finitely many) primes \\\\mathfrak{p} of K. For example, a rational number is a square of a rational number if it is a square of a p-adic number for almost all primes p. The Grunwald‚ÄìWang theorem is an example of a local-global principle.It was introduced by , but there was a mistake in this original version that was found and corrected by . * Hua's identity: In algebra, Hua's identity states that for any elements a, b in a division ring, :a - (a^{-1} + (b^{-1} - a)^{-1})^{-1} = aba whenever ab e 0, 1. Replacing b with -b^{-1} gives another equivalent form of the identity: :(a+ab^{-1}a)^{-1} + (a+b)^{-1} =a^{-1}. * Hua's lemma: In mathematics, Hua's lemma, named for Hua Loo-keng, is an estimate for exponential sums. * Heterosis in rice, three-line hybrid rice system: A team of agricultural scientists headed by Yuan Longping applied heterosis to rice, developing the three-line hybrid rice system in 1973.Sant S. Virmani, C. X. Mao, B. Hardy, (2003). Hybrid Rice for Food Security, Poverty Alleviation, and Environmental Protection. International Rice Research Institute. , p. 248 The innovation allowed for roughly 12,000 kg (26,450 lbs) of rice to be grown per hectare (10,000 m2). Hybrid rice has proven to be greatly beneficial in areas where there is little arable land, and has been adopted by several Asian and African countries. Yuan won the 2004 Wolf Prize in agriculture for his work.Wolf Foundation Agricultural Prizes *Huang-Minglon modification: The Huang-Minglon modification, introduced by Chinese chemist Huang Minlon, is a modification of the Wolff‚ÄìKishner reduction and involves heating the carbonyl compound, potassium hydroxide, and hydrazine hydrate together in ethylene glycol in a one-pot reaction.Organic Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 4, p. 510 (1963); Vol. 38, p. 34 (1958). (Article) *Ky Fan norms: The sum of the k largest singular values of M is a matrix norm, the Ky Fan k-norm of M.The first of the Ky Fan norms, the Ky Fan 1-norm is the same as the operator norm of M as a linear operator with respect to the Euclidean norms of Km and Kn. In other words, the Ky Fan 1-norm is the operator norm induced by the standard l2 Euclidean inner product. *Lee‚ÄìYang theorem: The Lee-Yang theorem in statistical mechanics was first proved for the Ising model by future Nobel laureates Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen Ning Yang in 1952. The theorem states that if partition functions of certain models in statistical field theory with ferromagnetic interactions are considered as functions of an external field, then all zeros are purely imaginary, or on the unit circle after a change of variable. *Pu's inequality: In differential geometry, Pu's inequality is an inequality proved by Pao Ming Pu for the systole of an arbitrary Riemannian metric on the real projective plane RP2. *Siu's semicontinuity theorem: In complex analysis, the Siu semicontinuity theorem implies that the Lelong number of a closed positive current on a complex manifold is semicontinuous. More precisely, the points where the Lelong number is at least some constant form a complex subvariety. This was conjectured by and proved by . *Sun's curious identity: In combinatorics, Sun's curious identity is the following identity involving binomial coefficients, first established by Zhi-Wei Sun in 2002: (x+m+1)\\\\sum_{i=0}^m(-1)^i\\\\dbinom{x+y+i}{m-i}\\\\dbinom{y+2i}{i} -\\\\sum_{i=0}^{m}\\\\dbinom{x+i}{m-i}(-4)^i = (x-m)\\\\dbinom{x}{m}. *Tsen rank: A Tsen rank of a field describes conditions under which a system of polynomial equations must have a solution in the field. It was introduced by mathematician Chiungtze C. Tsen in 1936. *Wu's method: Wu's method was discovered in 1978 by Chinese mathematician Wen-Tsun Wu. The method is an algorithm for solving multivariate polynomial equations, based on the mathematical concept of characteristic set introduced in the late 1940s by J.F. Ritt.P. Aubry, D. Lazard, M.

Science and technology in China Discoveries China Discoveries ","title":"List of Chinese discoveries"},{"id":"18899978","text":"Italian Damone is a two-player abstract strategy board game from Italy. It belongs to the draughts (checkers) family, and it is specifically a diagonal checkers variant. Each player's pieces are initially placed on two opposite corners of the board and move towards the opposite corner with the possibility of promotion for most of its pieces. The flow of the game is generally between these two opposite corners hence the diagonality of the game. Each player only has eight pieces to start the game, which is relatively small compared to most checker variants. Unlike the undifferentiated pieces as found in most checker variants at the beginning of the game, the pieces in Italian Damone are already differentiated by rank. The pieces are ranked from high to low as Damone, Damas, and Pedine. The Damone is sometimes referred to as Imperatore. The standard game has 1 Damone, 2 Damas, and 5 Pedines for each player. A player's piece can only capture an opposing piece if the opposing piece is the same rank or lower; therefore, it cannot capture a higher ranked piece. As mentioned earlier, Italian Damone is an example of diagonal checkers. But among non-diagonal checkers, the game closely resembles Italian draughts and Dablot Prejjesne as these games have the common feature that pieces can only capture opposing pieces of the same rank or lower. There are a few variants of Italian Damone. One variant starts off with 3 Damas and 3 Pedines with no Damones. Another variant requires only the capture of all Damones to win the game which makes the game more dynamic, and resembles Chess. In Italian, Damone means \\"big king\\", Dama means \\"king\\", and Pedine means \\"checker man\\".  Goal  In the standard game, the player who captures all their opponent's pieces is the winner. Alternatively, stalemating the enemy's pieces by not allowing them to move is a win for a player. In some other variants, it is enough only for a player to capture all their opponent's Damones to win the game.  Equipment  A standard 8 x 8 draughts board is used. In the standard game, each player has 1 Damone, 2 Damas, and 5 Pedines. One plays the red pieces, and the other player plays the black pieces. Another variant consist of 3 Damas and 3 Pedines, but no Damones. However, pieces can be promoted to higher ranks such as Damone.  Rules  1\\\\. Players decide what colors to play, and who starts first. 2\\\\. Pieces are played only on the black diagonal squares of a standard draughts board. 3\\\\. Each player plays from a corner of the board opposite from each other. Each player's pieces are set up on their corner of the board. Each player's Damone is at the corner black square. The 2 Damas are found on the next diagonal of black squares, and specifically at the squares that lie on the edges. The 5 Pedines are found on the next diagonal of black squares. 3\\\\. Players may either move one piece in a turn, or use one piece to capture enemy piece(s) in a turn. Players alternate their turns. 4\\\\. A Pedine moves and captures in three directions. Since the setup of the pieces are on opposite corners of the board, moving \\"forward\\" means moving diagonally toward the enemy's direction. For example, if a player starts from the lower right-hand corner of the board, then moving forward means moving in a northwest direction (towards the upper left corner of the board). Additionally Pedines may move \\"sideways\\" in two directions. In this example, the player can move their Pedine in a northeast direction (towards the upper right corner of the board), or in a southwest directions (towards the lower left corner of the board). Pedines can never move or capture \\"backwards\\" which in this case would be toward the southeast direction (lower right corner of the board). Damas and Damones can move and capture in all four directions. All pieces may move only one space diagonally onto a vacant black square on the board in a turn. 5\\\\. Pieces can only capture enemy pieces of the same rank or lower. The Damone is the highest ranked piece, and therefore can capture all types of pieces from the other player including their Damone. The Dama is the second highest ranked piece, and can capture only the other player's Damas and Pedines, and not the Damone. The Pedine is the lowest ranked piece, and can only capture the other player's Pedine, and not the Damas or Damones. 6\\\\. A piece captures by the short leap as in most draughts games. The piece leaps over the adjacent enemy piece onto a vacant square on the other side. Captures are compulsory. Multiple captures are allowed, and must be taken. Players must choose the highest rank capturing line available to them. Capturing lines are ranked as follows from highest to lowest preference: * i) The capture with the longest capturing line has the highest preference. * ii) If two or more capturing lines have equal number of captures, then the Damone's capturing line is preferred over the Damas' capturing line or the Pedine's capturing line; furthermore, the Damas' capturing line is preferred over the Pedine's capturing line. * iii) If a decision still cannot be made (for example, a situation where two Damones have an equal number of pieces that can be captured), then one must look at the highest ranked piece on each capturing line. The capturing line with the highest ranked piece in it must be taken. * iv) If a decision still cannot be made (for example, a situation where two Damones have an equal number of pieces that can be captured, and each have at least one Damone in their capturing line), then the capturing line that contains the most number of the highest ranked piece must be taken. Example #1: Two Damones (Damones A and Damones B) can capture in a player's turn. Damone A can capture 2 Damones and 1 Pedine Damone B can capture 1 Damone and 2 Damas Both capturing lines have an equivalent number of pieces (3 pieces), and therefore rule (i) does not apply. Both capturing pieces are Damones, and therefore rule (ii) does not apply. Both capturing lines have a Damone as their highest ranked piece, and therefore rule (iii) does not apply. However, Damone A can capture 2 Damones, whereas, Damone B can only capture 1 Damone. By rule (iv), Damone's A capturing line must be taken. Example #2: One Damone has two capturing lines. Line A consist of 2 Damones and 1 Pedine Line B consist of 1 Damone and 2 Damas Both capturing lines have an equivalent number of pieces (3 pieces), and therefore rule (i) does not apply. There is only one capturing piece for both lines of capture, and therefore rule (ii) does not apply. Both capturing lines have a Damone as their highest ranked piece, and therefore rule (iii) does not apply. However, Lina A consist of 2 Damones, whereas, Line B consist only of 1 Damone. By rule (iv), Line A must be taken. * v) If a decision still cannot be made, then preference is given to the capturing line that contains the next highest piece. * vi) If a decision still cannot be made, the capturing line with the most number of next highest pieces is preferred. The same logic is applied over and over again until a decision is made. * vii) However, if a decision cannot be made after this process, then the player may choose any of the capturing lines that he or she wishes. Example #3: Two Damones (Damone A and Damone B) can capture in a player's turn. Damone A can capture 1 Damone and 2 Damas. Damone B can capture 1 Damone, 1 Dama, and 1 Pedine. Both have an equal number of pieces to be captured (3 pieces), and therefore rule (i) does not apply. Both capturing pieces are Damones, and therefore rule (ii) does not apply. The highest piece in both capturing lines is a Damone, and therefore rule (iii) does not apply. Each capturing line has the same number of Damones (only 1 each), and therefore rule (iv) does not apply. The next highest piece on both capturing line is a Dama, and therefore rule (v) does not apply. However, Damone A can capture 2 Damas, whereas, Damone B can only capture 1 Dama, therefore by rule (vi), the capturing line that must be taken is that of Damone A. Example #4: One Damas has two capturing lines. Lina A consist of 1 Damas and 1 Pedine Line B consist of 1 Damas and 1 Pedine Both lines consist of an equal number of pieces (2 pieces each), and therefore rule (i) does not apply. There is only one capturing piece involved, and therefore rule (ii) does not apply. The highest piece in both capturing lines is a Damas, and therefore rule (iii) does not apply. Each capturing line has the same number of Damas (only 1 each), and therefore rule (iv) does not apply. The next highest piece on both capturing line is a Pedine, and therefore rule (v) does not apply. Each capturing line has the same number of Pedines (only 1 each), and therefore rule (vi) does not apply. A decision cannot be made yet based on the first six rules, and therefore, rule (vii) applies, and the player is free to choose either Line A or Line B to capture. 7\\\\. A Pedine is promoted to Dama when it lands on the two squares originally occupied by the other player's Damas. A Dama is promoted to Damone when it lands on the square originally occupied by the other player's Damone.

It has a very detailed historic profile, from the early historic age till the Partition of Pakistan. Maini lies at latitude 34¬∞07'07.23\\" north and longitude 72¬∞36'32.38\\" east with an elevation of about 383 meters above the sea level. Total area of Maini valley is about 5 kilometres from east to west and 6 kilometres from north to south.https://www.google.com/maps/@34.1172381,72.6060247,14z The population of Maini is now exceeding 80,000 (not according to the Government census). It is considered as one of the highly educated area of Topi Tehsil, where there are about twenty five Government primary schools, a Government high school for boys, a Government high school for girls, one Government degree college (Sahibzada Muhammad Khurshid Memorial College), one private girl‚Äôs college and more than two dozen of private primary and high schools. These institutions produced highly qualified personals for the country, who are serving the nation in different public sector departments and private sector as well. Most of the population Maini also helps the country in foreign exchange earnings; where they serve the Gulf and European countries in this respect. On the other side initial health facilities are provided in the Government's Basic Health Unit while one can also find a dozen small private medical units. With these basic and dire needs, Maini also provides good opportunities for the sports facilities. There is an official sports ground, named as Cheeno, in its development the Government is taking keen interest but a case has been filed in the court which made it disputed. Most of the population play cricket, soccer (football), badminton volleyball and kabaddi, while the local game mukhka/makha is also played only at the arrival of summer. Cheeno Sports Ground (seen from Muradu Dherai) Makha or Mukha (local game played at Maini) Geography Maini is located 17 kilometers east of Swabi city, 5 kilometers north of Topi city and 2 kilometers west of Gadoon Amazai Industrial Zone. The main Swabi-Topi road provides a connection near Kotha village which runs towards north and takes 5 kilometers to arrive at Maini village. This road is also an ancient track which then runs north of Maini, goes through Jhanda village and extends to Buner District. On the three sides Maini is bounded by hills while the southern plain gap provides a flowing route to one hill- torrent (wuch khwar), one river (kundal river) and a natural spring (Cheena) that are running through its heart and irrigate the southern fields. Map of District Swabi (showing Maini in yellow colour) Maini resides in the southern foothills of 2225 meters high MahƒÅba·πá Range of mountainshttps://www.google.com/maps/@34.299645,72.6869021,14z while Ajumair hill lies in its west and the barren Gadoon hills are lying in its east which blocks the water of Tarbela Dam. All these mountains are Piedmont zones and a tentative division between lesser Himalayas and the Hindu-Kush (Dani 2001: 13). Topi lies in its south (most accurately south-southeast), Kotha village lies in its proper south, Baja & Bamkhel lies in its southwest, it is bounded by Ajumair hill in the west, Boko & Jhanda lies in its north-northwest, Pabini lies in its north, Malakabad (old Malka-kadai) lies in its north-northeast, Beesak lies in its northeast, Gadoon-Amazai Industries lies in its east and the Gadoon Afghan Refugee Camp lies in its southeast. Subdivisions Maini village comprises numerous subdivisions locally called tapas or mohallahs. Originally the tapas where formed at the time of Sheikh Mali baba between the year 1500‚Äì1550, at the time when the newly acquired lands were distributed among the families. These tapas were as follow: # Sheikh Mali Khel # Mani Khel # Said Ali Khel # Khadhar Khan Khel # Niki Khedad # UR Ibrahim # Habib Khel # Arab Zai # Juna Khel # Gulbahar 1 # Gulbahar 2 # Redawan (U.S.R) When the population had grown and people moved out of the center of the maini to the surrounding area, new mohallahs were formed for administrative purpose only. These newly formed mohallahs were usually a mixture of the people of the tapas. Some of the mohallah are QƒÅsim AbƒÅd, PatyƒÅ (FƒÅteha), Tulk≈´, GulbahƒÅr-1 and 2, Shƒ´ngrai, KutkƒÅn·πõe, Ga·πõhai, Poray (Faqir) Kalay, JƒÅ·πõe (GulistƒÅn), S≈´lai, Raidawan, Rahƒ´ma, HƒÅji Khel, Kambaray, Shakrai, Soganday and Kass (Zarin Abad). General View of Maini from Rahima Dherai Name As for as the nomenclature of the name Maini is concerned, most of the local elders are of the view that it is a derivative from the name of a certain non-Muslim Queen Mainamati (erroneously called Mainawati by the locals). History mentions Queen Mainamati as the wife of Manikachandra of Candra dynasty who ruled during 10th/11th century A.D in Bengal. Whereas, some of the modern writers are of the view that the term Maini may be taken from the name of a group of passerine birds common Myna or Mynah. However, a thorough research is needed to search the term Maini in Sanskrit and Prakrit languages. Zafar Hayat Khan of the Department of Archaeology, University of Peshawar is taking keen interest and trying his best to solve the issue of the term Maini. Languages, People and Religion Pashto is the main language spoken in a specific dialect. Urdu being National language is also spoken and understood. People mainly belong to the Utman tribe of Mandanr, the specific branch/lineage of Yusufzai clan. Whereas the religious background of the whole population is Sunni Muslim. However, before the partition of Pakistan and India in 1947, Hindu community was living side by side with the Muslim community, who were known as the business class Hindus. Climate Maini features a semi-arid climate, with very hot summers and cold winters. Winter starts in mid-November and ends in late-March, while summer months are from May to September. The mean maximum summer temperature surpasses during the hottest month, and the mean minimum temperature is . The mean minimum temperature during winter is , while the maximum is . Here the rainfall occurs in both winter and summer because it is a monsoon region which comes under both the Malakand and Hazara zonal rainfall regions. Due to western disturbances, the winter rainfall shows a higher record between the months of February and April. Wind speeds vary during the year, from in December to in June. The relative humidity varies from 46% in June to 76% in August. The highest temperature of was recorded on June 1995, while the lowest occurred on January 1970. Natural Mounds Deelor Dherai lies in the north of Maini which separates it from Pabini, whereas it blocks the Kundal River from entering the populated area of Gulbahar. One can approach this mound through Deelor/Kundal route, leads from Gulbahar-1 to Pabini village. General View of Maini, Kundal River and Cheeno Sports Ground from Muradu Dheri Salo Dherai and Shado Dherai lies in the northwest of Maini which can be considered the northern portion of Ajumair hill. These natural mounds are a division between Jhanda and Maini and can be approached from Qasim Abad through the Jhanda road. Ajumair hill is the highest and largest amongst all the natural mounds which covers the whole western border of Maini. It naturally separates Maini from Baja and Bamkhel village and is accessible through Gulbahar-1, Garhai and Kutkanre through Dundhery and Jabay routes. A View of Muradu Dheri from Sulai Banr Dherai another low mound is located inside Maini but in its southwestern territory. It separates the two Mohallahs of Maini, one Kutkanre being in its north and the other Soganday in its south. It is approachable through the Kutkanre‚ÄìBaja route and through Soganday. General View of Banr Dheri and Parts of Ajumair Rahima Dherai also resides inside the populated area of the village which is located a little east to the Banr Dherai. One can access this low mound through Najeem Jare and through Mohallah Rahima. Sulai Dherai lies inside the thickly populated area of Maini which is now mostly covered by modern houses. It resides in the south-central part of the village which can be approached from Raidawan, Shalizara and Sulai Mohallahs. View of Ajumair Hill Muradu Dherai is a low mound which is located beside the Cheeno sports ground on the bank of Kundal river which provides a scenic view to the sports lovers. It resides in the southeast of Maini which can be approached through Karpa route and the modern Pehur high level canal. Loye Salay, Boos-Dhery and Tor-Batai are other natural mounds which are located immediately in the eastern populated area and resides Poray (Faqir) Kalay Mohallah in its gulfs. Two of these block the water of Kundal river and separate the eastern agricultural lands of the village from the populated area. These can be approached through Karpa route, Poray Kaly and Tor-batai route. Ghundhery resides in the center of the village, looks like an ancient stupa, and is a low hill now covered by modern houses on all the sides. Khazana Dherai and Patya Dherai lies in the north-northeast of Maini which is natural division between Mohallah Patya and Chatya. Khazana Dherai can be considered as a natural block to the Kundal river which does not let the water approach Chatya wand. These two mounds are accessible through Chatya route and Patya route. History As far as the ancient cultural profile of this part of the World is concerned, we do not know much about the Pre-Historic and Proto-Historic age. There may be several archaeological sites that can produce the traces of human habitation before the second millennium B.C but that will need thorough and methodical archaeological excavations. The earliest evidences we so far have is the arrival of Achaemenian (Persian Zoroaster), who are evident by their seglois. Achamenid Rule The historical profile of this land can be traced back to the time of Achaemenians (Persians of 6th to 4th century B.C). The Achaemenid Empire in Swabi region is evident in the historical literature where the writer Qureshi (1967: 83) says, \\"The districts west of river Indus as far as the river Kabul were inhibited by the Astacenians and Assacenians who paid tribute to the Achaemenian king, Cyrus who ruled from 558 to 530 BC\\". Astacenians were the Ashtak, a confederacy of eight tribes in the Peshawar region and Assacenians were the Ashvakas (generally identified with modern Yusufzai, who still live in this valley). Buddhism Religion Buddhism extended its horizons up to the western borders of Gandhara and enfolded in its wings the regions between Kabul River and Indus River. The mounds of Maini produce Buddhist remains all around. Due to the presence of Buddhist remains, Maini may be termed as a critical part of Gandhara civilization. Alexander Invasion Alexander, who had a rivalry with Achaemenians, during 327 BC, after crushing western parts of GandhƒÅra, entered the plains of Swabi to fight against the Ashvakas (Qureshi, 1967: 93) and to meet the second division of his army for crossing Indus River at Hund, ancient UdhbƒÅndepur or Ohind. He may have entered Maini when chasing his Persian counterparts. Mauryan Empire The Rock Edicts of Ashoka in Shahbazgarhi prove the presence of Mauryan Empire in the nearby regions of river Indus. And the pious Ashoka sent his missions into this part of Gandhara for the propagation of his dhamma. Indo-Greek Period The short-lived occupation of Mauryans lasted for a century which did not completely wipe out Greek influence. The occupation of Indo Greek kingdom in Maini is evident from their large number of coins, which provides the information that before their invasion this place was introduced to them. Buddhist and Hindu remains that are scattered throughout this valley are the finest examples of Buddhist livelihood in this region. Kushan Rule The most powerful and renowned sovereigns of Kushans made Gandhara a veritable holy land of Buddhism through the sacred shrines and monasteries. The valley of Maini is filled with the archaeological sites erected during the Kushan Empire which prove the widespread character of Kushan Art. One can find large number of coins of Scythians and great Kushans with the inclusion of small number of coins of Hindu Shahis (Turk-Shahis) and Muslim dynasties in the nearby mounds which produces a ray of hope that they have ruled this valley. Huns/Ephthalite Invasion In Pakistan, generally, the Kushans were followed by Ephthalite H≈´·πáas, who destroyed the Buddhist establishments. Whereas the monuments at Maini would have faced the same situation. When Hs√ºan-Tsang came to northwest frontier, he found the country in a ruinous depopulated state with most of the Buddhist establishments in a state of decay. Most of the archaeological sites of Maini were then left unpopulated. Hindu Shahi Rule KƒÅ√±·πõo Dherai, a mound filled with dressed stones, has the remains of Hindu-Shahis which has signs of burning and flaming on its stones. These burnt stones indicate that Ghaznavids have rooted out the Hindu- Shahis from here and burnt their possessions. Arrival of Yusufzai Later on, the famous Yusufzai (Pashtun tribe) than occupied this region and till now the utmƒÅn (from the lineage of Mandan·πõ), a sub-tribe of Yusufzai, use to live here. It is constantly obvious in the history and in the Pashto writings that a war broke between the Yusufzais and Mughals in the northern fields of Topi (Rasool, 1993: 12). While the northern fields of ·π¨opi belong to Maini which means that the war was fought in Maini valley. Islamic Period Sheikh Mali Baba (originally named as ƒÄdam), a renowned and wise man in the Pashto history also belonged to this valley who is responsible for the allotment of the lands among the Pakhtoon tribes, from Indus to Swat. His descendants still live in Maini who are known as Sheikh-Mali Khel and Mani Khel. He was a pious man who wrote a book, Daftar, about Yousuzais and about the territory reforms of the Pakhtoon valley (Nawaz, 1987: 249-253). 1857 War and the War of Independence During 1857 War of Independence some of the Muslim saints entered Maini who were followed and killed by Sikhs and British army in the nearby fields. Two of the saints have their graves in Habƒ´b-Khel Mosque while the others are lying in the eastern fields across the hill torrent. Brigadier- General Sir Neville B. Chamberlain, a British soldier from the PunjƒÅb garrison, was appointed at Maini valley and Topi region to draw the radicals of Sepoy Mutiny from behind the hills lying in the southeasterly direction of Ambela near the right bank of river Indus (Vevill, 1977: 50). Archaeological Sites Archaeological Sites at Maini A large number of Buddhist and Hindu archaeological sites are in Maini valley. The main village was founded on ancient remains and the main populated area is surrounded by several archaeological sites of various types. Famous archaeological sites of Maini are Ba√±·πõ Dherai, Najeem JƒÅ·πõe graveyard, MurƒÅdu Dherai, HƒÅji Khel, S≈´lai Dherai, Rahƒ´ma, KƒÅ√±·πõo Dherai, Ajumair Hill, Ghundheray, ShƒÅdo Dherai, ·∏åeelor (Lan·∏çay) Dherai, KhazƒÅna Dherai, PatyƒÅ (FƒÅteha) Dherai, T≈´lk≈´ Dherai, Shakrai Dherai, Kas Dherai, Parts of ShƒÅlizara, Ga·πõhai, ·∏åhundheray and the parts of the fields between Shakrai and Kambaray. Maini valley has a strategic position due to its geographical setting. The famous Buddhist sites of Azƒ´z Dheri and RƒÅni-Gha·π≠ lies in its west beyond the Ajumair hill, the Suumpur stupa of Baja lies in its southwest, Gala fort and Sri-Ko·π≠ are situated in the southeast, archaeological site of Banj hill lies in its east and Shah-kot Baba fort (on MahƒÅba·πá top) lies in its north.

It is a network of tunnels and caverns, as well as an extensive woodland. Information in the St. Helens local history archives states that sandstone quarrying began here as early as 1730. As the quarry expanded, the cost of purchasing land to open cast mine it increased, so it was decided to opt for a different method. Instead of quarrying out the stone, they would mine it out, following a seam of stone until it ran out. This resulted in the network of caves, tunnels and shafts we see today. Rainford Delph is listed as a Colliery by 1854, under the ownership of Charles Howarth or Yorkshire Charlie as he was known locally by 1880. Mining finally ceased and the woods and caverns were used as a game reserve by the Earl of Derby until 1939, when they became a storage facility for ammunition for the anti-aircraft position at Crank. After the war, the caverns ceased use as a game reserve. Today, Crank Caverns are not officially open to the publicand due to their increasing instability, attempts have been made to close access to the caverns and tunnels themselves. Despite this, the site is still physically accessible from a nearby public footpath and is still a draw for generations of curious locals who wish to explore, many having heard the numerous local myths and legends from an early age. Caverns The mines are an example of pillar and stall mining, with the roof having support provided by pillars of stone left in place when mining was taking place. There are two sets of caverns, the first and most noticeable caves have seven portals and lead down into a large cavern. To the back and to the left of this was a roadway which was sealed in 1948. Beyond the roadway is an extensive network of tunnels, with access being possible from secure location. The other set of caves lies north west of the first set. These caves lie at the bottom of a deep ditch. One is simply a short tunnel, the other leads into a deeper set of caves. The entrance to the deeper set of caves is gated. Myths and legends There are numerous myths and legends associated with the caverns. The most well known is that during the Reformation local Catholics being persecuted by King Henry VIII (1491‚Äì1547) took shelter in the caverns and conducted secret mass there, but mining on the quarry only began in about 1730. Some stories report the caves running to, amongst other places, Up Holland in Lancashire, Church of St Mary, Lowe House in St. Helens and Moss Bank in St. Helens, another stated that there was in fact a tunnel running some seven miles from St. Helens Town Hall to Crank Caverns in order to conduct 'secret' hangings. \\"Vicious dwarves\\" were once rumoured to inhabit a labyrinth of caverns in Crank. In the late 18th century four children decided to explore the sandstone caverns and vanished. One child survived and told a story about small old men with beards who killed his three friends and chased him. The petrified child stumbled over human bones in the caves and finally managed to scramble through an opening to the surface as a hand was grabbing at his ankle. The authorities were concerned because a number of people had gone missing in the area near the cave entrances. Two heavily armed soldiers descended into the caverns with torches and claimed that they not only found a heap of human bones, they also found the ruins of an ancient church of some unknown denomination. The interior of the church was lit by three large candles and grotesque gargoyles formed part of an altar. Throughout the exploration of the underground, the soldiers said they felt as if they were being watched, and also heard voices speaking in an unknown language. One report said that a child's head was found in a cave, along with evidence of cannibalism. After a second investigation, the caves either collapsed or gunpowder was used to seal them.

Early life and education Clery was born at 46 Lower Leeson Street, Dublin, to Arthur Clery (who also used the names Arthur Patrick O'Clery and Arthur Ua Cl√©irigh), a barrister, and Catherine Moylan. His father, who practised in India, published books on early Irish history and was politically an associate of Isaac Butt. Clery was brought up to a considerable extent by a relative, Charles Dawson. A cousin, William Dawson (who used the pen-name \\"Avis\\"), became his closest friend and associate. Clery was educated at the Catholic University School on Leeson Street (where he acquired the confirmation name \\"Chanel\\" in honour of the Marist martyr Peter Chanel, which he often used as a pseudonym), at Clongowes Wood College, and University College in Stephen's Green. He was a university contemporary of James Joyce. Professional life Clery's principal themes included the difficulties of Roman Catholic graduates seeking professional employment, dramatic criticism (he hailed Lady Gregory's play Kincora as the Abbey Theatre's first masterpiece but was repulsed by the works of Synge), Catholic-Protestant rivalry, tension within the Dublin professional class, and the vagaries of the Gaelic revival movement (including Clery's own attempts to learn Irish in Ballingeary, and such questions as whether a true Gael should play tennis). Clery advocated partition on the basis of a two nation theory, first advanced in 1904‚Äì05 (possibly in response to William O'Brien's advocacy of securing Home Rule through compromise with moderate Unionists). Several of his articles on the subject were reprinted in his 1907 essay collection, The Idea of a Nation. Clery derived this unusual view for a nationalist from several motives, including a belief that arguments for Irish nationalists' right to self-determination could be used to justify Ulster Unionists' right to secede from Ireland, fear that it might be impossible to obtain Home Rule unless Ulster were excluded, and distaste for both Ulster Protestants and Ulster Catholics, whom he saw as deplorably anglicised. He remained a partitionist for the rest of his life. Clery was not particularly successful as a barrister, but on the establishment of University College Dublin (UCD) in 1909 he was appointed to the part-time post of Professor of the Law of Property. After 1914 he moved from unenthusiastic support for John Redmond's Irish Parliamentary Party to separatism. Before the 1916 Easter Rising he was an inactive member of the Irish Volunteers, and was defence counsel at the court-martial of Eoin MacNeill. During the 1918 general election he campaigned for Sinn F√©in. As one of the few barristers prepared to assist the Sinn F√©in Court system he was appointed to the D√°il Supreme Court. Clery opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty because he believed it would lead to re-Anglicisation and the eventual return of the Union. He was elected to D√°il √âireann as an abstentionist independent Teachta D√°la (TD) for the National University of Ireland constituency at the June 1927 general election. He did not take his seat and he did not contest the September 1927 general election since new legislation obliged candidates to pledge in advance that they would take their seat. Clery spent his last years in solitude, having never married. He was one of the lawyers who advised √âamon de Valera that the Irish Free State was not legally obliged to pay the Land Annuities which had been agreed in the Anglo- Irish Treaty of 1922. Personal life Clery was a close friend of Tom Kettle (who died serving on active duty in Europe during World War I), with whom he founded a dining club, the \\"Cui Bono\\". Hugh Kennedy (later Chief Justice of the Irish Free State) was also a lifelong friend. As Auditor of the L & H he tried to prevent James Joyce from reading a paper praising Ibsen (Clery had asserted that \\"the effect of Henrik Ibsen is evil\\") but Joyce succeeded in reading it after he argued his case with the college president. The principal influence on Clery was the Irish Ireland editor D. P. Moran, to whose weekly paper, The Leader Clery became a frequent contributor. (Clery also wrote as \\"Chanel\\" for the University College paper at St. Stephen's, and as \\"Arthur Synan\\" for the New Ireland Review.) Death Clery died, unmarried, in November 1932 in Dublin from pneumonia contracted at a public meeting. In addition to The Idea of a Nation, Clery published Dublin Essays (1920) and (as Arthur Synan) The Shadows of the King, a historical novel modeled on Thackeray's Esmonde.

In the early 1940s he helped lay the groundwork for the eventual development of polio vaccines by combining neurological research with the study of the pathogenesis of polio. With his understanding of the disease, he made a series of crucial discoveries that paved the way for the final development of a vaccine by Jonas Salk and later by Albert Sabin. He received the E. Mead Johnson Award in Pediatrics and the Karl Spencer Lashley Award for his work, along with numerous other distinctions. Biography  Early Life and Education  In 1910, David Bodian was born in St. Louis, Missouri to Jewish parents who had emigrated from the Ukraine. He grew up his four sisters and younger brother in Chicago, where he attended public school.http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir- pdfs/bodian_david.pdf He would later enter Crane Junior College after graduating from high school. In 1929 Bodian attended the University of Chicago, where he received a bachelor of science degree in zoology in 1931, his Ph.D. in anatomy in 1934 and his M.D. in 1937. He was under the supervision of Charles Judson Herrick, Norman Hoer and George William Bartelmez while working on his thesis project on the visual pathways of the opossum. It was during this time where he developed a staining technique for nerve cells. In the following year of 1938, Bodian spent a few months at the University of Michigan as a National Research Council postdoctoral fellow under the direction of Elizabeth Crosby.  Career  In 1938, Bodian was offered a fellowship in the Department of Anatomy at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine to join Howard A. Howe to study polio in monkeys. He later came to Johns Hopkins University in 1939 as a research fellow in anatomy where he would begin a long-standing partnership with Howe. However, this fellowship at Johns Hopkins University would be shortly terminated due to a lack of funding. In 1940, Bodian served an interim period of a few months as an assistant professor of anatomy at the Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, Ohio. When the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis awarded funding to the Department of Epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health to support research on polio, Bodian returned to Hopkins, and he and Howe joined the School of Hygiene and Public Health to continue their research in 1942. Bodian advanced from Assistant Professor of epidemiology to Associate Professor in 1946 and later became Professor of Anatomy and director of the department in 1957. He served as Editor-in-Chief of the American Journal of Epidemiology from 1948 to 1957. In 1977, he became professor emeritus of anatomy and neurobiology in the Department of Laryngology and Otology. In his later work, Bodian studied the spiral structure within the cochlea known as the Organ of Corti as well as the morphology of nerve cells.  Personal life  In 1944, David Bodian married Elinor Widmont, a medical illustrator and painter who contributed illustrations to some of his published articles. Together, they had three daughters: Brenda Jean, Helen, and Marion and two sons: Alexander D. and Marc. Bodian later died of Parkinson's disease in September 1992. Major Contributions  The Bodian Stain  In 1935, while researching the visual pathways of the opossum, Bodian developed a method of staining nerve cells in paraffin using silver proteinate or Protargol with gold and other fixing agents. This method allows for specific staining of nervous tissue and can be completed in under 24 hours. The process involves three major steps: silver impregnation, reduction, and toning. The impregnation step involves using a copper and Protargol bath to deposit silver along the nerve tissue, which allows for specific staining of certain parts of the nervous tissue and cells. The tissue is then placed into a reducing solution of hydroquinone. Lastly, the stain contrast and color is enhanced through the toning step with gold, in the form of gold chloride. This stain will appear as a dark brown color on parts of the nervous tissue such as the end-feet, myelinated fibers, and unmyelinated fibers. Bodian would go on in 1937 to refine the selectivity of the staining process through adjusting the formulations for the fixatives used. Through these adjustments, Bodian was able to study the structure of the synapses of the goldfish and catfish and the nervous systems of frogs, rattlesnakes, and crayfish.  Pioneering Work on Polio Vaccines  Over the next twenty years, the Hopkins team made a series of several discoveries which were crucial for the development of a polio vaccine. In a letter to A. McGehee Harvey, Bodian outlines some of their findings. They studied polio in monkeys and chimpanzees, and used those models for studying the disease in humans. A major breakthrough was the finding that human cells could be used to grow the virus. This led to the ability to isolate the virus from patients. Previous concepts regarding pathogenesis of the virus had to be changed based on the work with the wild-type isolates. The team demonstrated that primates and humans gained artificial immunity through formalin-treated virus. Another result of these studies was the finding that immunity to a disease is correlated to the presence of its antibody. He also found that large quantities of serum antibody were not necessary to block the invasion of polio virus into the nervous system, and that antibodies circulate in the bloodstream. In 1946, Dr. Isabel Morgan joined the team. Together, they found out that there were three basic immunological types of poliovirus, explaining the phenomenon of second infections and the fact that artificial immunity to only one strain would not protect against infection from the other strains. The primary difference between the three types is the capsid protein. All three are extremely virulent and cause the same symptoms. Their publication on the \\"Differentiation of Types of Poliomyelitis Viruses,\\" in the American Journal of Hygiene in 1949David Bodian, et al.: Differentiation of Types of Poliomyelitis Viruses: III. The Grouping of Fourteen Strains into Three Basic Immunological Types in: American Journal of Hygiene vol. 49 March 1949 became a milestone in the development of new polio vaccine methods. Honors and awards Thomas M. Rivers, Charles Armstrong, John R. Paul, Thomas Francis Jr., Albert Sabin, Joseph L. Melnick, Isabel Morgan, Howard A. Howe, David Bodian, Jonas Salk, Eleanor Roosevelt and Basil O'Connor. In 1941 Bodian received the E. Mead Johnson Award in Pediatrics from the American Academy of Pediatrics. In 1958, he was inducted along with his colleagues Howe and Morgan and twelve other polio experts into the Polio Hall of Fame at the Georgia Warm Springs Foundation. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1958, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1968. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1968 and the American Philosophical Society in 1973. In 1985, the Society honored him with the Karl Spencer Lashley Award. Bodian was an honorary member of the Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland, the French Neurological Society, and the Mexican Society of Anatomy, and he served as president of the American Association of Anatomists from 1971 to 1972. In 1980, the Johns Hopkins University dedicated the Bodian Room in the School of Medicine in recognition of his contributions to polio research. He received an honorary doctorate from the university in 1987.
