The book was composed in Arabic and was based on personal religious experience. It is regarded as one of his chief works and a classic introduction to the pious muslim's way to God.Watt, Montgomery. \\"Ghazali, /Abu /Hamed /Mohammad, ii, iii.\\" Encyclopedia Iranica. 1-12. Print. Originally spanning over 40 volumes, it deals with the principles and practices of Islam and demonstrates how these can be made the basis of a reflective religious life, thereby attaining the higher stages of Sufism. Some consider KimiyƒÅ al-Sa'ƒÅdat as a rewrite of this work, which is a common misconception. KimyƒÅ al-Sa'ƒÅdat is shorter than this, however Ghazali said that he wrote the former to reflect the nature of the latter and a few of his other theological writings.Netton, Ian R. \\"(Untitled).\\" Rev. of The Alchemy of Happiness Translated by Claud Field. Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, Apr. 1993: 117-18. Print. Background Ghazali was the student of Al- Juwayni, under whom he studied religious sciences, including Islamic law and jurisprudence. Nizam al-Mulk, the Seljuk vizier, recognized the great potential in Ghazali as a scholar and appointed him as the head of Nizamiyya madarasa in Baghdad. Ghazali, at the peak of his fame and scholarship went into a spiritual and intellectual crisis. He left his post at the institution on request of pilgrimage. He went into a long journey, travelling to Damascus, Jerusalem and finally to Mecca to perform the pilgrimage. Ghazali throughout the journey, was going through an inner spiritual struggle, and he became attracted towards the pathway of Sufis. This journey influenced Ghazali to write first on his autobiography Deliverance from Error and then his famous book The Revival of the Religious Sciences, explaining in detail about mysticism, theology, Islamic rituals and practices.  Structure  An old page with marginalia from The Revival of the Religious Sciences The book is divided into four parts, each containing ten books. It explains the doctrines and practices of Islam and showed how these can be made the basis of a profound devotional life, leading to the higher stages of Sufism or mysticism. * Part one deals with knowledge and the essentials of faith. * Part two discusses people and social customs. * Parts three and four are dedicated to the inner soul and explains first the vices that people must master in overcoming them and then the virtues that they must work hard to fulfil.  Influence  It became the most frequently read Islamic book after the Quran and the hadith. Its great accomplishment was to bring orthodox Sunni theology and Sufi mysticism together in a useful, comprehensible manner to guide every aspect of Muslim life and death.Hunt Janin, The Pursuit of Learning in the Islamic World 610-2003, p 83. The book was well received by Islamic scholars such as Nawawi who stated that: \\"Were the books of Islam all to be lost, excepting only the Ihya, it would suffice to replace them all.\\"Joseph E. B. Lumbard, Islam, Fundamentalism, and the Betrayal of Tradition: Essays by Western Muslim Scholars, p. 291.  Minhaj al-Qasidin  Al-Ghazali, despite being a scholar, was not an expert in the field of hadith and thus the hadith narrations contained in his book were scrutinized. Hadith experts like Ibn al- Jawzi and Ibn al-Qudamah al-Maqdisi researched and sorted out the hadith narrations contained in the book on the basis of their authenticities. They then wrote the Minhaj-al-Qasidin and its overview called Mukhtasar. The book was then carefully reworked by Ibn al Jawzi (597 AH) and the result of his work was named Minhaj al-QƒÅsidƒ´n wa Mufƒ´d al-ShƒÅdiqƒ´n. Ibn al-Jawzi's efforts in rewriting the book is considered important and while he had similarities with Al-Ghazali in terms of mastery in mysticism, he also had the superiority of expertise in the knowledge of the hadiths. The reworking by Ibn al-Jawzi focused on the re-examination of the existing hadiths, elimination of weak and disputed hadiths and their replacement with the authentic and sound ones so that the integrity of the book was not compromised. Minhaj al-Qasidin was a fairly thick book and it was summarized in the form of Mukhtasar by Imam Ibn Qudamah. Whenever Ibn al Jawzi focused on the study of hadith, he found the Mukhtasar book in line with its name, aiming at summarizing and making the essence of the previous book to be more concise, organized, and easy to understand. It also added additional notes so that it may become an easy book for students to read. Ibn Qudamah remarked that whenever he read Ibn al Jawzi's Minhajul Qasidin, he felt that this book was very useful for society, so he would read it again in order to absorb the deeper meaning for the second time. He said that his admiration for the book grew such that he also added some important missing topics that were readily available in other prominent books of his time with additional notes such as hadith and commentary.

Rabiz first emerged in Yerevan in the 1970-80s and was often associated with Armenian migrants from Baku, Kirovabad, and rural regions of Armenia. Rabiz singers are with few exceptions male. More recently, rabiz songs have been augmented with heavier arrangements and electronic dance music elements in their instrumentation. Despite the term's widespread use, the etymology or definition of the word \\"rabiz\\" is not clearly understood. According to some sources it stems from the Russian phrase \\"—Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–∏ –∏—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–∞\\" (rabotniki iskusstva) used during Soviet times, meaning \\"Art Workers\\", in reference to unions which specialized in new music composition. Others believe that the word has Turkish or Arabic roots, since the word \\"rab\\" means creator or god, while the Arabic name \\"aziz\\", which is used by many Armenians as meaning \\"darling\\" could perhaps be considered another root, thus referring to the genre performers as dear creators. A subgenre of rabiz music, called \\"kef\\" (unrelated to the homonymous Armenian- American kef music), concerns romantic love and partying, but also love of family or patriotism, similarly to Russian chanson or blatnyak. Though the singers and their audience primarily refer to rabiz as a music genre, the term is also used broadly to refer to a certain type of subculture with its particular fashion, Russian-derived slang, and lifestyle. The genre has received criticism from various music critics due to its perceived similarities to Middle Eastern and Turkish arabesque music. Prominent performers of the genre include Aram Asatryan, Tatul Avoyan (known by the mononym Tatul), and Hayk Ghevondyan (known as Spitakci Hayko or more commonly by the mononym Hayko). Some performances of Rabiz music are characterized by code-switching in which Rabiz peformers such as Mingichauri Samo (Samvel Avanesyan) and Spitakci Hayko (Hayk Ghevondyan) - reminiscent of similiarly multi-lingual pieces by ashugs such as Sayat Nova - improvise simultaneously in different languages such as Armenian, Azerbaijani, Kurdish and Russian. The sociologist David Leupold suggested that this particular aspect of Rabiz music may also help to challenge inter-ethnic boundaries hardened by decades of inter-state hostilities between Armenia and Azerbaijan in the ongoing Nagorno- Karabakh conflict. Outside of Armenia, rabiz also enjoys popularity in the Armenian diaspora, particularly in Russia and Los Angeles, California where it is known as \\"Losangelnots\\" (). Many of the performers of the genre are now greatly popular with Armenian diaspora listeners as well. \\"Mi Gna\\" In 2016, rabiz music achieved international commercial success with the viral hit single \\"Mi Gna\\" released by Armenian American rapper Super Sako, on his album Love Crimes. Although an earlier version of the song in Armenian was composed by Artak Aramyan, the remixed version of the song with additional English lyrics by Super Sako propelled it to success. The song features vocals by Hayk Ghevondyan. \\"Mi Gna\\" hit #1 on Shazam Top 100 list, with its YouTube video upload has garnered over 190 million views. The song has been remixed numerous times since, as well as released in different language versions, including Albanian, Arabic, Bulgarian, Dutch, French, German, Hebrew, Kurdish (Sorani), Romanian, Russian, Serbian, and Turkish. A trilingual Armenian/English/French version, remixed by French-Congolese rapper Ma√Ætre Gims, achieved success in France and the Francophone world.

From 1959 to 1972, he was the head of the Institute of Contemporary History, a leading German research institute on the history of National Socialism. Krausnick co- authored Die Truppe des Weltanschauungskrieges, the 1981 work on the mass murder of Jews in the occupied territories of the Soviet Union by the Einsatzgruppen, which was considered a milestone in Holocaust studies. It was also one of the first publications to challenge the myth of the \\"clean\\" Wehrmacht. Education and career Helmut Krausnick was born in , today a district of Brunswick in 1905, and grew up in Bad Harzburg in a middle-class family. He studied history and political science at the University of Breslau. In 1932 Krausnick joined the Nazi Party.Fritz Bauer Institut: Auschwitz: Geschichte, Rezeption und Wirkung. Campus, Frankfurt/Main 1996, S. 135, N. 26. He continued his academic studies at the University of Heidelberg and the Humboldt University of Berlin, where he received his doctorate in 1938. Subsequently, Krausnick worked at the National Archives; in 1940 he moved to the Archive Commission of the Foreign Office. From September 1944 to May 1945, he served in the Wehrmacht. From 1948 Krausnick worked at the . In 1951 Krausnick joined the Institute of Contemporary History in Munich, headed by . When the latter died in 1952, Krausnick completed Mau's work, German History, 1933‚Äì45: An Assessment by German Historians, which appeared in 1956 and was translated into many languages. In 1959 Krausnick was appointed director of the institute, remaining in the position until his retirement in 1972. In 1968 he was appointed an honorary professor of contemporary history at the University of Munich. Krausnick appeared as a court expert in Nazi trials. In 1980 he was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. Krausnick died in 1990 in Stuttgart. Die Truppe des Weltanschauungskrieges Krausnick co-authored Die Truppe des Weltanschauungskrieges (\\"Troops of an ideological crusade\\"), the 1981 work on the mass murder of Jews in the occupied areas of the Soviet Union by Einsatzgruppen units. The research completed by the authors shows that the Einsatzgruppen leaders were predominantly career policemen, some with law degrees, and sons of upper- middle class Germans, who compensated for failings in their studies or careers by joining the SS. Many had been pre-1933 Sturmabteilung (SA) \\"stormtroopers\\". The book traces the beginnings of the Einsatzgruppen during the Anschluss of Austria in 1938 and then during the invasion of Poland in September 1939, where they engaged in the persecution of clergy, intellectuals, Polish nobility, and Jews. The invasion of the Soviet Union unleashed the genocidal murder of Jews and other civilians in the occupied territories by the Einsatzgruppen death squads. Reviewing the book for The Journal of Modern History, political scientist calls it an \\"utterly absorbing, if grisly, reading for the non-specialists and systematic confirmation for historians specialising in the area\\". The book is considered a milestone in Holocaust studies. Historian Peter Longerich describes the work as a \\"seminal academic study\\", which made Krausnick the leading figure in the Holocaust functionalism versus intentionalism debate. Krausnick was an \\"intentionalist\\" who posited that Hitler had made the decision to kill European Jews in the spring of 1941, in the run-up to Operation Barbarossa. Myth of the Clean Wehrmacht Krausnick conducted research on the Commissar order and other criminal orders and their implementation by the German armed forces. Die Truppe des Weltanschauungskrieges was one of the first works to challenge the legend of a \\"clean\\" or \\"innocent\\" Wehrmacht, which had depicted the German armed forces as free of blame for the crimes committed. The book provided evidence of what the authors described as the \\"terrifying integration of the army into Hitler's extermination program and extermination policy\\". Their research refuted the notions that the Wehrmacht generals did not know about the activities of the Einsatzgruppen and that, had they known, they would have opposed them. The book provides an example of the November 1941 Orsha Conference organised by Franz Halder, chief of the German General Staff, to discuss the course of the Battle of Moscow. At the conference, the generals said unanimously that the activities of the Einsatzgruppen were \\"worth their price in gold\\" for the fighting troops because they ensured security in the rear of their armies.

That year, she was nominated by Freddy Ehlers to be his Vice President during his 1996 presidential run. The move was considered controversial by supporters on both the left and right wings of Ecuadorian politics, due to her environmentalism and her support of Opus Dei, respectively; the ticket finished third with 21% of the vote.

History  The children's railway was designed and built by volunteers starting in autumn 1979, the UNESCO proclaimed International Year of the Child. The railway station was designed by Juschgorsel Project Institute (–Æ–∂–≥–æ—Ä—Å–µ–ª—å–ø—Ä–æ–µ–∫—Ç) and the tunnel and the bridge by the Giprofosfor Institute (–ì–∏–ø—Ä–æ—Ñ–æ—Å—Ñ–æ—Ä). The architecture of the railway station was nominated for the Lenin Prize. Tulpar railway stations resembles a funny camel, which has the snout of a lions cub for some reason, although Tulpar is actually a winged stallion in Kazach folklore. The first train ran in February 1980, and in May of the same year the railway was regularly used.  Track  Condition of the track in 2017 The children's railway connects the northern part of the city with a recreation ground with an arboretum, an artificial lake and a zoo. The train runs from the railway station named Sportiwnaja (–°–ø–æ—Ä—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–∞—è) near the sports stadium via Chadschi Mukan (–•–∞–¥–∂–∏ –ú—É–∫–∞–Ω) to the station named Tulpar (–¢—É–ª–ø–∞—Ä) near the entrance of the zoo. Initially, the children's railway was nearly the only way to get to this recreation ground, and thus it was used by 176,000 passengers in the months from Mai to September of year of its inauguration. The track has a complex height profile: Immediately after passing the bridge behind Sportivnaya is a nearly long incline with two sharp radii. There is also an approximately long tunnel, a cable-stayed bridge and another bridge.  Rolling stock  TU2 diesel locomotive-112 and two PW51 carriages, 2017 One TU2 diesel locomotive stems from the Alma-Ata Children's Railway, the other from the mine and smelter Atschpolimetall (–ê—á–ø–æ–ª–∏–º–µ—Ç–∞–ª–ª) in Kentau. Two PW51 carriages of the Demichovsk factory are used for passenger transport. Some of the older Pafawag carriages are mothballed in Sportiwnaja railway station, some of them are used occsionally as back-up. The TU2-269 locomotive was decommissioned for spares. Even so, there is a significant lack of spare part. In summer 2003 the railway had to be closed temporarily twice due to maintenance issues of the locomotive. 2010 it was in use, and even longer than in previous years, because it started operating in April.

Between 1994 and 2010, she was a senior adviser, chief of staff, and chief operating officer of the Library of Congress.  Education and early career  A native of Mon Louis Island, Alabama, Jenkins graduated from Theodore High School in Theodore, Alabama, in 1976 and went on to attend Spring Hill College where she majored in Political Science. After graduating from Spring Hill College in 1980, she became a voter outreach worker on Ronald Reagan's 1980 Presidential Campaign. Following the campaign in 1981 she began working as an executive assistant at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and later moved to the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), where she served as special assistant to Secretary of Transportation Elizabeth Dole from 1985 to 1987. In this role Jenkins and Dole led an effort to bring women into leadership positions across the DOT. She spent three years in the private sector as a partner for Quality Management Services from 1987 to 1990. Jenkins then joined the U.S. Department of Agriculture as Director of the department's Office of Advocacy and Enterprise, a position she held from 1990 to 1993.

The festival grew to become a large-scale event, with more than 200,000 people attending in 2016. In 2008 she developed the Library of Congress Experience, which digitized important written works including the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, and the Constitution of the United States. This allowed people visiting the library to compare the rough drafts of these founding documents with their final versions, showing edits, corrections and margin notes made by key authors including Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and John Adams.  AARP  Jenkins joined AARP in 2010 as president of AARP Foundation, the organization's affiliated charity. In this role, she focused the foundation on four areas of work affecting Americans age 50 and up: income insecurity, housing, isolation and hunger. She created a program with NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon called Drive to End Hunger, which drew attention to the issue of food insecurity among older Americans by donating 36 million meals and providing funding to more than 100 organizations fighting hunger in the U.S. Following one year as Chief Operating Officer, Jenkins was appointed to her current role as CEO of AARP in 2014. According to The Washington Post, Jenkins \\"fundamentally recast the organization‚Äôs mission\\" based on the trend of longevity. AARP was originally formed to serve people approaching and in retirement but she observed that as Americans are living longer they are working longer and are eschewing previous generations' definition of what lifestyles they choose to live at and beyond age 50. She described this shift, saying \\"we know that people who continue to work or even volunteer can live longer than people who don't. So all those misperceptions of what people want when they retire or what they want to do in their older life I think is being totally torn apart by the idea that people are going to live longer, healthier ‚Äî and hopefully in better financial shape ‚Äî than they had in the past.\\" Under Jenkins' tenure close to half of AARP's 38 million members are still working full- or part-time, representing her strategy to evolve AARP as Boomers and Generation Xers desire and need to continue working longer than their parents' generations. She oversaw the introduction of new benefits designed to help AARP members find work at employers with age- friendly employment practices and continued the organization's involvement in advancing legislation to strengthen federal age discrimination laws.

After SourceFed was cancelled in late March 2017, Suptic began a web series on his personal YouTube channel called Alternative Lifestyle, and subsequently co-founded Sugar Pine 7 with Clayton James and James DeAngelis, who had become regular cast members of the series. Regarding their style, Suptic has described Alternative Lifestyle as a \\"freeze-frame narrated, hyper- surrealistic, improv-based comedy that uses the vlog format as a vehicle to promote a character-driven story\\". The name \\"Sugar Pine 7\\" refers to the name of the cabin the main group once stayed in. The first \\"season\\" of the series ended with a short film/sketch entitled \\"Akrasia.\\" Rapidly gaining popularity, the show is often described as a blend of scripted comedy bits and improvisation.

Sidney Bunce was born Sidney Dolores Percy on 19 August 1892 in Chelsea, the artist's quarter of London, England. She was the daughter of Herbert Sidney Percy and granddaughter of Sidney Richard Percy, both well-known Victorian artists, and members of the Williams family of painters. She began her art studies on leaving school, and studied with her father, and at St John's Wood Art School in London, where she won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Arts at Burlington House in London. However, the donating institution withdrew her scholarship when they discovered she was a woman and not a man. She immigrated in 1921 to Canada where she married Henry John \\"Jack\\" Bunce, with whom she moved in 1923 to California, living for several years in Pasadena before moving in 1936 to Madera, California, where they lived until 1946 when they settled in Santa Cruz. She retired with Jack in 1959 to Saratoga. It was in Santa Cruz that she became associated with the Santa Cruz Art League, with whom she served for several years on the Board of Directors, and held various posts, such as Exhibition Chair and General Chair of the 1953 State Wide Exhibit. She then became associated in 1959 with the Los Gatos Art Association, serving with them as a Director and President of the Association. Sidney was proficient in several painting styles, having trained partly with her father, who was both a noted portrait artist (in oils), and competent watercolor landscape painter. However, she was known primarily for her pastel portraits. She also taught painting classes in both watercolor and oils for several years for the Los Gatos Art Association. She died on 22 December 1965 in San Jose, although her residence at the time was Saratoga. She is buried in Los Gatos Memorial Park.

She was the last Jew to earn a PhD there before the Second World War, in December 1936. Career On arriving in London, Hackenbroch soon joined the staff at the British Museum, and was one of those who excavated and catalogued the Sutton Hoo treasure. She was the jewellery adviser to the 1944 film of Henry V, starring Laurence Olivier. From 1946 to 1949, Hackenbroch was based in Toronto, Canada, at the behest of the UK government, to provide expert advice on the Lee Collection of Renaissance art given to Canada by Arthur Lee, 1st Viscount Lee of Fareham, to thank the country for its World War II support. In about 1949, she moved to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York to catalogue the \\"immense art collection\\" of Irwin Untermyer.

This variety was created in France in 1986 by INRA in Lalevade-d'Ard√®che. It is mainly used as root stock because of its good compatibility with many varieties. Maraval produces a big mahogany colored nut from triangular to elliptical triangular shape. It keeps well. Peeling is mediocre but good in boiling water. Its fruit can be used fresh as well as for processing. It is not very demanding to the quality of the soil and produces fruit in 4 to 5 years. I grows in warm regions such as Gironde, Dordogne, Pyrenees- Atlantiques, Midi-Pyrenees in 250 to 300 m of altitude. The tree is considered partially self-pollinating since its pollen is not very fertile . Its early budding makes it sensitive to spring frosts. It is resistant to leaf rust and ink disease. The tree is a mid-season hybrid variety, upright with moderate vigor and medium stature. This allows denser orchards than other hybrids such as Marigoule. As a rootstock, it is: compatible with the varieties Bouche de Betizac, Bournette, Precoce Migoule, Maridonne. It is incompatible with Marigoule and Primato.

Daniel Mojon is president of the program committee of the Swiss Academy of Ophthalmology (SAoO).Weblink: https://www.saoo.ch/  Scientific works  Mojon has published several studies demonstrating the extent to which people with strabismus suffer discrimination and stigmatizing in daily life - squinting children, for instance, get invited, als Mojon could prove, to fewer birthday parties.Mojon-Azzi SM, Kunz A, Mojon DS :Strabismus and discrimination in children: are children with strabismus invited to fewer birthday parties?

Specialized in treating strabismus since the 1990s, Mojon developed minimally invasive strabismus surgery (MISS) as an alternative to conventional and more traumatizing surgical techniques that use a limbal approach to allow direct access to Tenon's space for horizontal muscle resection, recession or plication. Unlike these conventional techniques, minimally-invasive strabismus surgery is done using an operation microscope and usually under general anaesthesia. Reportedly, there is considerably less swelling the day after the operation after MISS than following more extensive surgical opening of the conjunctiva. The long-term outcomes with respect to alignment, visual acuity and complications were comparable.Mojon DS: Comparison of a new, minimally invasive strabismus surgery technique with the usual limbal approach for rectus muscle recession and plication.

It is a major sport in the country, and was introduced in the late-19th century in the city of San Pedro de Macor√≠s by Cuban immigrants. After the United States, the Dominican Republic has the second-highest number of baseball players in Major League Baseball (MLB). The Dominican Republic national baseball team has won the Baseball World Cup in 1948 and the World Baseball Classic in 2013.  History  During the 1870s, many Cuban citizens fled Cuba because of the Ten Years' War. Many relocated to the Dominican Republic, bringing with them the sport of baseball. The nation's expert class was established in 1890. The first clubs were Ozama and Nuevo. On 7 November 1907, the Licey club was established in Santo Domingo. By the 1930s, it had developed into a major source for gifted players whose guardians frequently worked at sugar refineries. In 1937, Negro League stars from the United States including Satchel Paige came to the country. In the mid-1950s Rafael Trujillo built the main stadium. Dominican players initially began migrating to the U.S. to play for Major League Baseball, starting with utility infielder Ozzie Virgil. =1951‚Äìpresent= A summer league began in 1951. In the 1955‚Äì56 season, it joined the professional association. Since then, the league has attracted many top players from the major leagues. Beginning in the 1955 season, the country's international presence grew attracting global attention. As of 2015 opening day, Dominicans were 83 of Major League Baseball's 868 players. At the beginning of the 2016 season, no country other than the United States contributed as many.https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/04/03/472699693/baseball- is-a-field-of-dreams-and-dashed-hopes-for-dominicans Baseball academies Baseball academies are how Major League Baseball recruiters develop the talent they find across all Latin America. Every single one of the teams in the MLB has a baseball academy in the Dominican Republic. With four out of every ten Dominicans living in poverty, baseball has become a small beacon of hope for many Dominican families. The baseball academies in the Dominican Republic offer many young boys what may be their and their family's only chance of overcoming poverty, and as a result many boys as young as age 13 drop out of school to focus all of their attention on baseball and someday playing for the MLB.https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/04/03/472699693/baseball- is-a-field-of-dreams-and-dashed-hopes-for-dominicans However, it is estimated that only two percent of Dominican recruits are actually able to make a living playing in MLB, leaving many of these young recruits finding themselves aged 19‚Äì21 with no education, no work skills, and no job prospects. Because of this, many baseball academies in the country have made efforts to incorporate educational programs that teach English and financial skills to their recruits, to better prepare them for the future.https://www.panoramas.pitt.edu/art-and-culture/dominicans-dugout-latin- america%E2%80%99s-role-american-baseball Notables Notable Major League Baseball players who came from the Dominican Republic include: =Pedro Mart√≠nez= Pedro Mart√≠nez, from Manoguayabo, was a Major League Baseball player from 1992 to 2009. He played for five teams and was best known for his tenure with the Boston Red Sox, joining with Ortiz to help them win the World Series in 2004. From 2002 to 2006, Mart√≠nez held the league record for the highest career winning percentage by a pitcher. He won three Cy Young Awards and was the first Latin American pitcher to achieve at least 300 strikeouts in a season and 3,000 in a career. Mart√≠nez reached the 3,000 strikeout mark in fewer pitches than any pitcher other than Randy Johnson. Mart√≠nez was the only pitcher to acquire 3,000 strikeouts with fewer than 3,000 innings pitched. Mart√≠nez became a U.S. citizen in April 2006. He was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2015. =Sammy Sosa= Sammy Sosa was born on 12 November 1968 in San Pedro de Macor√≠s. Sosa was a slugger and had his best years while he played for the Chicago Cubs. Sosa influenced many Dominicans and is best known for his record-breaking season in which he hit 61 home runs. =David Ortiz= David Ortiz arrived in MLB in 1997, experiencing injuries that slowed his progress. Ortiz signed with the Boston Red Sox in 2003 but did not play much until he became their designated hitter later that year. In 2004, Ortiz became known globally for his achievements. During the 2004 season, he hit 41 home runs and had 139 RBIs while batting .301.

The church was founded by the Basel Evangelical Missionary Society in 1847. Previously near the Christiansborg Castle at a hamlet called Osu Amanfong, where a commemorative monument now stands, the church relocated northwards to its present location near the Salem School when a new chapel was constructed and consecrated in 1902. The church is affiliated to the Presbyterian Church of Ghana. Liturgical services are conducted in English and the Ga language.  Historical background  The origins of Christianity on the Gold Coast can be traced to the arrival of Portuguese traders in the early 16th century. They baptized the paramount chief of Fetu, Cape Coast in 1503. By 1576, the spread of Christianity had stalled. In the subsequent two hundred and fifty years, activities of a few missionary societies including the French Capuchin Franciscans based in Axim and Komenda, the Moravian Mission in Accra and Elmina as well as the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts in Cape Coast yielded negligible outcomes in the hinterlands. Missionaries of the Basel Evangelical Missionary Society arrived in the Danish Protectorate of Christiansborg, (now the suburb of Osu) in Gold Coast in 1828 at the behest of the then Danish Governor, Major Christopher von Richelieu. Founded in 1815 in Basel, Switzerland at the height of the Pietist theological movement, many of its young missionaries came from working class artisan backgrounds in Wurtemberg located in southern Germany. Pietism sought to ‚Äúrevitalise the Christian church from within by deepening and making more personal the religious life of the Christian community. It aimed at expressing their Christian convictions through positive deeds and exemplary life-styles including spreading the Gospel to other continents in response to the ‚Äòcall of God‚Äô.‚Äù In their view, formal education, agriculture, small scale industry, arts and craft went hand in hand with the propagation of the Gospel. Several European communities from the United Kingdom, Denmark and the Netherlands had an established presence on the coast where trade and commerce flourished. The Danish colonial administration permitted its employees to co-habit with local women in monogamous relationships. As such, a sizable Euro-African community existed at the time which consisted of the ‚Äúmulatto‚Äù offspring of these unions. Major Richelieu's request for evangelization was geared at restoring Christianity morality among the population. Four Basel missionaries from Germany and Switzerland landed on the shores of the Gold Coast in 1828. They were Karl Salbach, Gottlieb Holzwarth, Johannes Henke and Johannes Schmidt. By 1831, all four who were in their twenties had died from afflictions from tropical diseases. A second missions group was dispatched by the Basel Mission in 1832. The missionaries were Andreas Riis, Peter Jager and Christian Heinze. Jager and Heinze died within a few months of their arrival from tropical illnesses. In the coastal town of Osu, only fourteen adult natives were converted Christianity from 1828 to 1850. The surviving missionary, Andreas Riis relocated to the hilly town of Akropong in 1835, where the cool climate was more favourable, effectively leading to the consolidation of the missionary work. The remaining Basel Mission post in Osu carried out missionary work and in 1847, the Basel Mission Church in Osu, which would later become the Ebenezer Presbyterian Church was founded by the mission. Similar churches were established in neighbouring Ga towns along the coast such as La and Teshie. The precursor to the church was the establishment of a school in 1843, the Salem School to educate the children of the Christian converts. The founding schoolmasters were the Americo-Liberian, George Thompson as well the West Indian Moravian missionaries, Alexander Worthy Clerk and Angolan-born, Catherine Mulgrave who were working under the auspices of the Basel Mission. The Danes sold their fort, the Christiansborg Castle in 1850 to the British authorities. In 1852, the British introduced a poll tax ordinance which was fiercely opposed by the locals. The natives of Osu, La and Teshie refused to pay the new tax imposed and in 1854, the British bombarded the township with their warship, the ‚ÄúH. M. Scourge‚Äù. The mud huts were reduced to rubble and several inhabitants relocated to the hinterland plains beneath the Akwapim ridge. The infrastructure of the Basel Mission was destroyed in the melee. As a result, a team of 30 Basel missionaries and their converts moved their operations to the hamlet of Abokobi to start a new mission station on land bought that had been earlier bought by Andreas Riis. According to Basel mission historical records, ‚ÄúJohannes Zimmerman, the head of the Abokobi mission station had a vision of not only creating there a model Christian farming community but also the settlement there of German Christian farmers and craftsmen to demonstrate to the heathen community the totality of Christian living.‚Äù The Abokobi station became a model Christian station, on which the Osu post at Amanfong was rebuilt in 1856. = Building of the chapel = South entrance of the church In 1856, the Abokobi emigrants returned to Osu after rebuilding efforts kicked off. The local Christian community decided to build a new chapel to replace the old one which had become too small for worship. Furthermore, its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean led to the corrosion and decay of the structure. Osu was now a much larger town with natives living further inland. The chapel was therefore now far from the inhabitants. The Christiansborg Castle was no longer the hub of activity of Osu. The natural noise of the sea waves made it very difficult to hear the sea waves during church services. In 1862, there was a massive earthquake in Accra which damaged parts of the Christiansborg Castle. After the capital of the Gold Coast moved from Cape Coast to Accra, the Danish fort became the official seat of government. The renovations included the construction of a residential quarters for the Governor of the Gold Coast. For security reasons, the British colonial administration bought the surrounding huts and land around the castle and converted it to a botanical garden. For these reasons, it was decided by the congregation to move to a new site. In 1898, the church acquired a plot of land north of the Osu coast in a central part of the town that was easily accessible by the Christian locals and distant from the ocean. The missionaries chose a site near the Salem quarters which housed the middle boarding school. This location would also not interfere with drumming and dancing of the traditional community. The church had to raise funds for the new chapel to be built. The church carried out a fundraising campaign from 1898 to 1901. Funds were raised in Deutsche Marks (DM). About DM 1800 came from general contributions of community members, DM 2500 was reallocated from the Basel Mission Committee Poor Fund for building the chapel, DM 2600 was from the European community living near the castle at Amanfong and DM 4000 from the African Ga Christians living in Osu. The African civil servants working at the seat of government pledged to contribute a sum of DM 200 monthly until the completion of the chapel building but payments were irregular. The decision by the Basel Mission to use money from the Poor Fund was based on the fact that several congregants were involved in trade or worked in the colonial civil service and had a relatively high standard of living. The Fund was therefore not being used. An additional DM 2000 was raised in Basel and remitted to Osu. This was an exception because normally, the Basel Mission Committee did not fund overseas construction projects. Funds had always been raised locally in the mission stations but the committee waived the rule due to the enthusiastic engagement of native congregants which was appreciates by member of the Osu church. The Basel Committee commissioned Karl Epting, a missionary architect from Basel who lived on the Gold Coast to prepare the drawings of the new church and supervise the project. Epting had to divide his time between Accra and Kumasi where the renovation of the Basel Mission House was taking place. The foundation stone of the church was laid on 1 March 1902. Many artisans and craftsmen of Osu volunteered their services for free. By the beginning of July 1902, the structure had reached a height of 25 feet. The wooden super-structure to support the roofing tiles was firmly put in place and the walls of the chapel were completed. The tower of the church which would house the belfry stood at 85 feet and a crucifix was placed atop it. Inside the chapel, an upper gallery with a seating capacity of 200 was constructed. The floors were filled with stones 18-inches deep. Women and children played key roles with the transportation of stones for floor tiling. = Consecration and opening ceremony = East wing of the Chapel with the extension, north and south vestries in view The formal opening of the church was to take place on 19 October 1902. Old pews from the old chapel were transported to the new church. New pews were also built to fill the remaining space. The pulpit was a personal gift from Robert Richter Bannerman, a carpenter and the youngest Presbyter at the time. Affixed to the pulpit was an inscription on ebony wood taken from Psalm 119 verse 105 (KJV): ‚ÄúThy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path‚Äù with a black cross engraved above it. The altar was jointly designed by Bannerman and Epting but paid for by the Basel Mission pastor and historian, Carl Christian Reindorf. C.C. Reindorf's son Jonah Reindorf presented four hanging lights, each bearing five separate lamps, chandelier fashion to be used during evening services. The Baptismal Font, made of mahogany was presented by the Basel Missionary, the Rev. Widmaer. Baptismal and Communion vessels were brought from Amanfong; and new cloths for covering the Altar, Pulpit and Baptismal Font were donated by the congregants. On Friday 17 October 1902, a Cement Tablet which is still in position today, was placed in the space above the main Entrance of the Church, bearing the inscription: \\"EBEN-EZER 1902 1 Sam 7: 12\\" The stone tablet inscription is a biblical reference to 1 Samuel 7:12 (NIV), \\"Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen. He named it Ebenezer [stone of help], saying, 'Thus far the Lord has helped us'.\\" On Saturday, 18 October 1902 at 6 p.m., the church bells were tolled for the first time. Members from other mission stations from the Ga-Dangme district had also arrived for the ceremony earlier that week. On Sunday 19 October 1902, the boys of the middle boarding school, the Salem School marched through the Osu township in a pre- dawn musical procession led by the Missionary Schultze. A large crowd assembled at the ruined old chapel at Amanfong at 9am for a short farewell service. A Prayer of Thanksgiving was given by Samuel Wuta Ofei, a minister of the Basel Mission. A large crowd then processed to the new chapel led by the Basel missionaries and the African pastors in their clerical robes with the first three holding a Holy Bible as well as the Holy Vessels for Baptism and Communion. The ministers of the church were followed by Presbyters, primary and middle school children and the teeming masses of Christians from the Osu community. In attendance was the paramount chief of Osu, Nii Mantse with his entourage in their traditional regalia. Karl Epting gave the introductory speech at the entrance before handing over the keys of the church to the most senior missionary at the time, Michael Seeger. Soliciting more funds went beyond the completion of the construction project. Per the Basel Report of the Dedication of the new church, Seeger made an appeal to friends in Basel for the donation of certain items of equipment and adornment for the new Church, explaining, ‚ÄúWe are soliciting these from friends and well-wishers in our (home) country because our own members are now saddled with such a heavy debt due to the cost of the building that they will not be able to provide the money for them at the present time‚Äù. The church was filled to capacity with 1500 people. Later that afternoon, a special service was held with the Acting Governor of the Gold Coast, Capt. L.R.S. Arthur, C.M.G in attendance, together with his private secretary. On the occasion of the Golden Jubilee of Osu Eben- Ezer Chapel building in 1952, the Architect and Builder, Karl Epting, then an old man in Basel, recalled in a congratulatory message: > ‚ÄúI look back with joy upon [the] ten years during which I was privileged to > work in the Gold Coast. It was in 1902 that the task of building the Church > at Christiansborg was entrusted to me and many willing helpers. I seem to > see before my very eyes today all the carpenters, masons and carriers hard > at work. Without them, I would not have been able to do the job. I send to > all who remember me my hearty greetings.‚Äù = Facilities = Later additions to the chapel include the acquisition of a pipe organ as well as a chancel and an arch to separate the chancel from the nave of the chapel. Two vestries to the north and south of the chapel have also been constructed. Brass lecterns and tablets were also added to the church sanctuary. Over the years, the chapel has undergone renovations including the relocation of the belfry to the main grounds outside the chapel, the construction of a wall to fence the church campus, refurbishment of the upper gallery, re-roofing of lightweight aluminum sheets, placement of a ceiling, introduction of a chapel extension, the Carl Christian Reindorf Auditorium (originally known as the Shed) and replacement of the old pulpit with a terrazzo tiled concrete one. There is also a church hall on the chapel premises used primarily for social events and conferences. Within the main sanctuary, there are commemorative plaques to honour the early Basel and West Indian missionaries, the pioneer pastor-historian, Carl Christian Reindorf as well as other notable Presbyterian ministers of Osu and Emmanuel Charles Quist, the first Speaker of the Parliament of Ghana. The church administrative office, a Manse for the District Minister and residential apartments for the associate ministers and chaplains are adjacent to the church compound. The church owns and operates the private mission graveyard, the Basel Mission Cemetery in Osu, Accra which is opposite the Osu Cemetery (formerly known as Christiansborg Civil Cemetery) and near the Accra Sports Stadium. The church is also the owner of the Osu Presbyterian Preparatory School, established in 1975.  Hierarchy and church groups  Four ministers are assigned to the church at any given time. The head minister is the district pastor assisted by three other associate ministers. There are also lay preachers and a group of elected presbyters known as the Session. There are several groups in the church which is common to the Presbyterian denomination: Young People's Guild (YPG), Young Adults‚Äô Fellowship (YAF), Men's and Women's Fellowships, Bible Study and Prayer Group (BSPG), Children's Service, Boy's and Girl's Brigades, Junior Youth (JY), the Church Choir, Singing Band, the Ebenezer Melody Band and the International Bible Reading Association (IBRA).

It was founded by an enthusiast of early blues and jazz music named Dante Bollettino (sometimes misspelled Bolletino). History Bollettino began releasing new music on 78rpm discs in the late 1940s, including as manager of the label Paradox Industries, which was active from 1948 to 1952 and released music from, among others, Ray Burke and Knocky Parker.Paradox. The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz. 2nd edition, ed. Barry Kernfeld. He was also a record collector, and noted that many early jazz and blues recordings by musicians such as Louis Armstrong, Bessie Smith, and Jelly Roll Morton were out of print and unavailable except as difficult-to-find used copies.Clinton Heylin, Bootleg: The Secret History of the Other Recording Industry. New York: St. Martin's Press, 1995, p. 33. He then founded Pax Records to press discs himself, reissuing recordings from obscure musicians such as Cripple Clarence Lofton. He also started the label British Rhythm Society for reissues.Adrian Johns, Piracy: The Intellectual Property Wars from Gutenberg to Gates. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2009, pp. 438‚Äì441, 444. His next label, Jolly Roger, was founded in 1950 to compile historic out- of-print recordings from major jazz and blues musicians recorded by RCA and Columbia. He contracted with RCA's own custom pressing plant to manufacture the discs.Alex Sayf Cummings, Democracy of Sound: Music Piracy and the Remaking of American Copyright in the Twentieth Century. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013, pp. 55‚Äì57, 118. Jolly Roger was one of several labels operating in American cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Cleveland which in the 1950s issued compilations of early 78rpm recordings without authorization from the companies that had produced the originals.Barry Kernfeld, Pop Song Piracy: Disobedient Music Distribution Since 1929. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2011, pp. 126‚Äì127, 133‚Äì134, 175, 182. Rather than reissue them on 78rpm shellac discs, Bollettino issued them on the new 10-inch, 33rpm vinyl record, which put dispersed recordings into a single collection for the first time and made them available in a more durable commercial format. Burt Goldblatt designed an album cover for Jolly Roger which was used for a Billie Holiday reissue.Burt Goldbatt Obituary. New York Times, September 7, 2006. By mid-1951, according to historian Adrian Johns, \\"Jolly Roger was easily the most prominent of all the 'pirate' labels.\\" Bollettino's activities drew the attention of Columbia Records and Louis Armstrong; in early 1951, Columbia released its own compiled reissue of Armstrong's 1920s-era recordings. At the time Bollettino was operating, sound recordings were not eligible for federal copyright under United States copyright law; only the musical composition underlying the recording was eligible, and a mechanical license was available to Bollettino to release performances of the compositions without permission by paying a flat fee. Bollettino paid royalties for new recordings he commissioned with the profits from Jolly Roger's reissues. However, he did not pay royalties on all of the reissue recordings, and in 1952, the American Federation of Musicians blacklisted Paradox Industries and its subsidiary labels. Columbia then sued Bollettino in New York state court in February 1952, seeking an injunction for unfair competition. Bollettino initially fought the ruling, but was fined $5,000 for copyright infringement, and eventually settled, remarking, \\"My lawyer insisted that we had a good case and could win, but I knew the record companies would feel they couldn't afford to lose and would throw in everything they had. I was only twenty-three at the time and didn't have the money for a long, expensive court case, so I settled.\\" Aftermath Bollettino saw himself as a catalyst of the reissue business, noting later in his life, \\"afterwards the big companies began to reissue more jazz records, so maybe I accomplished something after all.\\" The legal battles over Jolly Roger's output, which attracted major newspaper and magazine attention in the early 1950s, were used by the recording industry as evidence to Congress that stronger copyright protection was needed. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) was founded in 1951 partly as a response to record piracy incidents at this time. Anti-piracy statutes were implemented in many states in the 1960s, and in 1971, a federal copyright law was passed which made recordings created after February 15, 1972 eligible for copyright protection.

With over 600 hours of flight time during the war, she was the longest serving female Canadian ATA pilot. She worked as a flight instructor at Barker Field in Toronto, Ontario, and her students included commercial pilot Molly Reilly and author June Callwood. She is a member of the Canadian Aviation Hall of Fame, the Order of Canada, and the Bush Pilots Hall of Fame.  Early life  Violet Milstead was born October 17, 1919, in Toronto, Ontario. Her parents were Edith and Harold Milstead, and she had one brother named Fred. Milstead was taken out of school at the age of 15 in order to help at her mother's wool shop. Although she first aspired to become a surgeon, by the time she was 16 she was determined to become a pilot instead. Milstead saved up money for flying lessons from working at her mother's shop. She took her first flying lesson on September 4, 1939. Only six months after her first flying lesson, she had earned both her private and commercial aviation licenses.  Career  = WWII = After completing her instructor's certification in July 1941, Milstead gave flight lessons to both military personal and private citizens at Barker Field in Toronto. Soon, however, wartime rationing effectively ended her instructing job. In 1943, learning that the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA) needed experienced pilots, Milstead travelled to England with fellow aviator Marion Orr. She was one of only four Canadian women who worked at the ATA, and she earned the rank of first officer, ferrying various twin-engine aircraft between factories and military sites. De Haviland Mosquito combat aircraft Milstead flew at least 47 types of aircraft during her wartime ferrying work, including Spitfires, de Havilland Mosquitos, Beaufighters, Hawker Tempests and Grumman Hellcats. She had to learn the controls and system of each new aircraft rapidly, and to assist with this Milstead relied on the \\"Blue Bible\\", a book of instruction cards on the inspection, take-off and landing procedures for each type of aircraft. ATA pilots were not allowed to use radio contact during flights, due to the risk of being overheard, so Milstead often had to navigate by dead reckoning, flying through storms, smog and darkness with little more than maps and compasses. Ground crews on airfields said that they knew how to recognise ATA pilots approaching, because \\"no one else would dare to fly in such bad weather\\". Milstead worked in cycles of two weeks, with four days off for rest, and typically flew up to eight flights per day. Despite carrying the same workload as her male ATA co-workers, she was paid 20 per cent less. Just over five feet tall, Milstead sometimes had to sit atop a packaged parachute in order to see out the windows of her aircraft. Milstead logged over 600 hours of flight time, and was the longest serving female Canadian pilot with the ATA. = Post-war years = A Fairchild Husky bushplane After being discharged from the ATA in 1945, Milstead returned to Canada and worked as a flight instructor at Leavens Brothers Air Services at Barker Field. Here, she met her future husband, pilot Arnold Warren. She moved to Sudbury next, to work at Nickel Belt Airways teaching and flying as a bush pilot. Milstead transported prospectors, miners, lumber personnel, hunters and fishermen in and out of northern Ontario, and also watched for forest fires. She was the first female Canadian bush pilot, and likely the only woman in the world teaching at a bush pilot school during the 1940s. Milstead often flew the Fairchild Husky in her bush work. She sometimes encountered difficulties with men. In one incident, before their aircraft took off, a male co-pilot attempted to kiss her, and she \\"spun him around and kicked him out the door\\". Things improved with time, however. \\"When the boys got over fainting spells from seeing a girl climb out of the airplane, they became very helpful,\\" Milstead later recalled. Following a two-year stint in Indonesia ‚Äì where Milstead's husband taught aviation but where she herself was forbidden from teaching ‚Äì the couple returned to Canada, where Milstead eventually found work as a librarian at Orlenda and the Ontario Water Commission. She retired in 1973, and she and her husband continued to fly for recreation in their own Piper Cub. Milstead taught several notable Canadians how to fly during her time as an instructor, including author June Callwood and commercial pilot Molly Reilly. Impressed by Milstead's skills, Callwood described her as a \\"Bush Angel\\", later writing an article about Milstead for a women's magazine.  Personal life  Milstead married pilot Arnold Warren in 1947, and they stayed together until Warren's death in 2000.  Honours  In 1995, Milstead was chosen to enter the Bush Pilots Hall of Fame. A year later, a documentary called A Time For Courage was produced about Milstead's ATA work by Cooper Rock Pictures. In 2004, Milstead was awarded the Order of Canada, and in 2009, a special Canada Post stamp was issued with her image on it. In 2012 she received the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Medal.

It received media coverage in 2017 for winning a no-bid contract to guard the American embassy in Moscow. History According to a Russian business registry, Elite Security (the oldest part of the Elite Security Holding Co.) was founded as a private company in 1997 by Oleg Popov together with Viktor Budanov and his son Dmitry. Viktor is known to be a former minority owner of at least three of Elite‚Äôs branches; records indicate that he no longer holds any ownership stake. According to Kommersant, the company‚Äôs head office in Moscow is run by Dimitry. Elite declined to comment on a New York Times inquiry as to the current role of Viktor and Dmitry. =Viktor Budanov= When Budanov started out in Soviet intelligence in the 1960s, his work included buying food and other provisions for double agent Kim Philby. In the late 1960s, Budanov was posted to Britain, which expelled him in 1971 under suspicion of spying for the Soviet Union. In 1992, he retired as a major-general in Russia's foreign intelligence service. In interviews, Budanov has stated that the current Russian President Vladimir Putin was his subordinate between 1987 and 1991. Budanov retired from espionage in 1992 after becoming upset by Russia‚Äôs direction under Boris Yeltsin, and has since voiced admiration for Putin, crediting him with saving Russia from the chaos of Yeltsin‚Äôs rule. American embassy contract In July 2017, Putin ordered the American diplomatic missions in Russia to reduce their staff by 755 employees. In order to reduce headcount, in November 2017, the U.S. Office of Acquisitions awarded a $2.8 million no-bid contract to Elite Security to guard the American Embassy in Moscow and consulates in St. Petersburg, Vladivostok, and Yekaterinburg. While U.S. Marines will continue to guard American diplomatic missions, Elite will took over the tasks previously handled by local Russian guards who had been directly employed by the American consulates. These guard do not generally have access to secure areas. In awarding the no-bid contract, the U.S. stated that \\"no company other than Elite Security Holding Co. has preestablished and licensed operations in all four Mission locations\\".

As a college tennis player, Berke gained All-America honors and the Ivy League Player of the Year award at Yale University. After sustaining a career-ending injury on the professional tennis tour, Berke turned to medical marijuana as a pain reliever and became a cannabis activist. Moving from stand-up comedy to YouTube, he made several viral videos, most prominently \\"Pot Shop\\", a rap parody of \\"Thrift Shop,\\" which garnered over 15 million views. He was a candidate for mayor of Miami Beach on two occasions, in 2011 and 2013, attracting international media attention with his unorthodox campaigns. He founded Bang Holdings, a digital media company that specializes in cannabis advertising. In 2017, Berke was one of the founders of the International Church of Cannabis, a religious organization that regards cannabis as a sacrament. Life and career =Tennis player= Steve Berke started playing in tennis tournaments at the age of 7. At age 14, he won his first national championship and represented the United States in the World Team Championships in Japan against fellow competitors Roger Federer and Lleyton Hewitt. When he was 16 years old, he represented the United States again, along with Andy Roddick and Mardy Fish, making it to the quarterfinals of the Orange Bowl. He left home to live and train at the Nick Bollettieri tennis academy in Bradenton, Florida. As a junior player, Berke won four Florida state championships and two national championships. In 1999 he was ranked No. 10 in the nation in the 18 and under age group and top 50 in the ITF world junior rankings. Berke went to Yale University and played number 1 for the tennis team. He went undefeated all season in his sophomore year (2001) and then made it to the quarterfinals of the NCAA tournament as the first unranked male player to do so. Berke finished with a 19-5 record, earning All-America honors, Ivy League Player of the Year, and first team All-Ivy. He was nationally ranked No. 45 in singles by the International Tennis Association in the preseason. He finished with a national singles ranking of No. 74 and doubles ranking of No. 29. Berke was expected to play No. 1 for Yale, but after completing the fall semester in 2003, he transferred to the University of California, Berkeley, where he repeated as an All-American. He received his degree from Yale later that year, and subsequently entered the professional tennis tour. But in one of his first tournaments, he severely herniated two spinal discs. =Reality TV and comedy= During his rehabilitation, Berke attended a casting call for Richard Branson's entrepreneurial television competition The Rebel Billionaire: Branson's Quest for the Best, which featured contestants racing the globe to compete to become CEO of Branson's Virgin Group. Berke competed and came in eighth, featuring in all but one episode. At the wrap party, Branson introduced Berke to marijuana. Before he was voted off the show, Sir Richard Branson mentioned that Steve had openly stated \\"I will lie, cheat, and steal for you.\\" Off the show, Berke tried to return to the tennis tour with drug prescriptions and spinal injections, but experienced side effects that made him turn to marijuana as a pain reliever and obtain a license from California to smoke medical cannabis. Berke spent a few months setting up a business selling the Moosh Pillow, a neck support for airline travelers that he had pitched during one episode of The Rebel Billionaire. When it didn't take off, he got a job in real estate management. In 2009, Berke started showing up at open-mike nights at Miami comedy clubs. Those turned into opening slots for comics such as Pauly Shore and Bill Burr. In 2010, he spent a summer in Los Angeles shooting music video parodies and posting them on YouTube. =YouTube parody videos= Berke has made a dozen YouTube parody videos. His first YouTube success was a pro-marijuana remake of Eminem's \\"Love the Way You Lie.\\" In the video called \\"Should Be Legalized,\\" Berke rapped with Dutch model and singer Charlotte Bruyn. It became a viral video, getting 400,000 hits before YouTube rated it NC-17. Berke's effort attracted the attention of pro-legalization groups such as NORML. In early 2013, Berke released his most famous video: a parody of \\"Thrift Shop\\" by Macklemore & Ryan Lewis. Called \\"Pot Shop,\\" it was another song promoting the legalization of marijuana. The video featured appearances by Playboy Playmate and internet celebrity Amanda Cerny and a short cameo from Macklemore in a show of support for the parody. In two years, \\"Pot Shop\\" had more than 14 million views on YouTube. \\"You're the law that I want (Yes on 2)\\", a 2014 parody of the song \\"You're the one that I want\\" from Grease, interpreted by Berke and model Briley Hale, invited Florideans to vote for Amendment 2 concerning the \\"Florida Right to Medical Marijuana Initiative.\\" Berke tracked down the original funhouse set from the film in a county fair in Decatur, Texas. The video went viral, but it was removed by YouTube due to a complaint from Warner/Chappell Music, the original song's publisher. Berke appealed and the video was eventually reinstated. =Miami Beach mayoral candidacies= In 2011, Berke decided to run for mayor of Miami Beach as a candidate of the \\"After Party.\\" He ran a tongue-in-cheek campaign as a rapper turned unconventional mayoral candidate defying political norms to ascend to political power. His campaign manager was Roger Stone, who helped the campaigns of Ronald Reagan, George Bush and G. W. Bush. Stone volunteered to advise Berke at no cost. During a city commission meeting, Berke asked Mayor Matti Herrera Bower to resign and brought internet celebrity Sexy Sax Man to play at the meeting. The video of this stunt has over 2 million views. His drive to decriminalize marijuana gathered 9,000 signatures to get the issue on the ballot. His campaign events attracted celebrities like LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Rob Gronkowski, and Reggie Bush. Although it was launched largely as a joke, Berke's campaign turned into a serious effort that drew national media attention. In the end, Berke finished second to Herrera Bower, garnering 29 percent of the vote on election day. For his second run for mayor in 2013, Berke ran a more serious campaign, assembling a team and crafting a platform based on a new public transportation system. Berke also made a Kickstarter campaign to raise money to make a documentary that would focus on his campaign and the political processes in Miami Beach. He eventually sold his documentary to MTV2. He created a platform he called \\"2020 Vision,\\" unveiling a six-year plan to address police misconduct, flooding, and pension liabilities. The centerpiece of the plan was the SkyLink, a $100-million cable car system strung across Biscayne Bay, linking Miami Beach to the mainland and addressing traffic and parking problems. His idea was taken up by Sir Richard Branson, who expressed his interest in sponsoring the SkyLink as a public-private partnership. The 2013 ballot included a straw ballot referendum on the issue of legalizing marijuana. The four-way race was eventually won by millionaire Philip Levine, who spent an estimated $4 million of his own money on the campaign, more than any other candidate who had run for Mayor of Miami Beach. =Bang Holdings= After his second election loss, Berke received offers from marijuana companies that wanted to be included in his YouTube videos. This happened because the cannabis industry lacked marketing channels, since major media providers restricted online marijuana advertising. Berke decided to create a social media network allowing advertisers to target the marijuana community and industry. He founded Bang Holdings and became its CEO. The company is publicly traded under the symbol \\"BXNG.\\" Its subsidiary, Bang Digital Media, provides brand management, cannabis-related digital content and social influencer-based marketing for the cannabis industry. By the end of 2016, Bang was running one of the leading cannabis-related Facebook pages, as well as sites on Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube, with a dozen influencers with 250,000 to 10 million followers each. Bang Digital Media attracted attention outside the marijuana market in 2016, when it used the then- presidential candidate Donald Trump as the test case for its chatbots, which were the first AI personalities to sell products to humans via Facebook Messenger. The chatbot called \\"The Donald,\\" offering a digital download of the U.S. Constitution, had a Facebook page with more than 400,000 followers. =The International Church of Cannabis= In 2015, Berke was in Denver for the Cannabis Cup on the 4/20 weekend when he noticed a church that was for sale. Berke bought the church with his parents, originally with the intention to turn it into condos or rental apartments. Then his friends suggested he keep it as a church and build a community around the spiritual benefits of cannabis. Berke and others established Elevation Ministries, the religious nonprofit organization behind the church, in September 2016. Then they founded the International Church of Cannabis as a religious organization using cannabis as a sacrament and adhering to no specific dogma. The Denver church was converted into the chapel headquarters and opened its doors on April 20, 2017. An amendment banning cannabis consumption in churches was submitted to the Colorado House of Representatives on the same day and rejected as an unconstitutional restriction on religion.

There was victualling activity on the site for the best part of 300 years from the mid-17th century through to the early 1960s. Initially known as the Red House, Deptford, the Victualling Yard was rebuilt in the late 18th century and became 'the largest food-processing operation in Britain, if not in Europe'. Deptford's proximity to the food markets of London made it especially convenient for victualling, and it served the requirements not only of its own neighbouring Dockyard, but also those of Woolwich, Sheerness and Chatham (as well as the Victualling Yard in Gibraltar for a time). After 1858 it was formally known as the Royal Victoria Victualling Yard. Origins: the Red House The river gate at the top of 'Drake's Steps', a long-established landing place on Deptford Strand. In the 17th century the Navy Board's victualling operation was based on Tower Hill in a complex of offices, residences, storehouses and manufactories which had been established in the reign of Elizabeth I. In 1650, to supplement these arrangements, a slaughterhouse was acquired by the Board of Victualling of the Commonwealth Navy, across the river and downstream, at Deptford. After the Restoration a private contractor, Sir Denis Gauden, was licensed as Surveyor of Marine Victuals. In 1665, with the Navy expanding rapidly, Gauden sought to ease pressure on the facilities at Tower Hill. He leased a property known as the Red House (a red brick storehouse which stood on a wharf adjacent to the Royal Dockyard). It first required rebuilding, having been damaged by fire in 1639; but in 1673 Gauden began to transfer a number of personnel and operations from Tower Hill to Deptford. The Red House was part of the Sayes Court estate. In the hands of private contractors, it continued to be used for naval victualling for the next 70 years; but in 1743 the Victualling Commissioners themselves acquired the lease with the intention of establishing their main depot there. That same year, plans were drawn up for a comprehensive redevelopment of the 11-acre site, designed to consolidate in a single location facilities for the purchase, production, packing and dispatching of foodstuffs, beverages and other victualling supplies for naval use (as well as providing residential and office accommodation for the Victualling Commissioners themselves). Over the next few decades, although victualling activity increased at Deptford, it is not certain to what extent these plans were realized. Fire remained a serious threat in this period; the yard is recorded as having caught fire in 1726, 1748, 1755, 1758 and 1761. Expansion: HM Victualling Yard Riverside storehouse and administrative office. It was only in the 1780s that HM Victualling Yard, Deptford, acquired the layout, scale and complexity of operations that it was to retain for the best part of the next two centuries. A comprehensive rebuilding took place, to designs by James Arrow (Surveyor to the Victualling Office, 1774-1785).Pevsner, The Buildings of England - London 2: South (Yale University Press, 1983 & 2002). Behind a row of riverside storehouses, the yard's various activities were accommodated in a variety of purpose-built manufacturing areas and specialised storage buildings, arranged around a central open space. To the south was the cooperage (for the manufacture and repair of barrels, in which the great majority of the yard's products were packed for storage and transport). To the west was a large meat processing area, with separate slaughterhouses, cutting houses and packing houses for beef and for pork. To the north, alongside a terrace of houses for senior officers, was a large brewhouse providing beer for the fleet, and towards the centre a bakery with twelve large ovens, which produced bread and ship's biscuits. In 1785 the Victualling Board closed the Tower Hill depot and Deptford became its centre of operations (though the commissioners themselves did not move to Deptford, instead transferring their office to Somerset House in 1787). =Operation= Certain provisions were purchased locally and then stored on site, including butter, cheese, peas and fish, as well as malt and hops for brewing and flour for baking. (Initially, flour was milled by the Board in a pair of nearby windmills in Deptford and Rotherhithe, but by 1802 these had been sold as they proved uneconomical.) Livestock arrived either by boat or else on the hoof, usually from Smithfield Meat Market by way of London Bridge. The slaughterhouses only operated in the cooler months of the year (October-April). Fresh meat (and fresh bread) were provided for ships in harbour or at anchor in the Thames, the Medway and The Nore; for ships going to sea, salted meat was provided (and biscuit rather than bread). Use was made of by-products: hides to make leather, tallow to make soap and candles, shins and bones to make portable soup. One characteristic that distinguished Deptford from the Board's other manufacturing facilities (in Portsmouth and Plymouth) was that, in addition to the aforementioned large-scale facilities, Deptford specialised in the production of other foodstuffs on a smaller scale, such as mustard, pepper, oatmeal and chocolate (each prepared in a dedicated milling area). There were also separate storehouses for sugar, tea, rice, raisins, wine and tobacco, all of which were purchased in London and stored in Deptford prior to being distributed for use elsewhere as required. In the late-18th and early-19th centuries, during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, Deptford's main task was to maintain a steady provision of victuals (either by manufacture or purchase) with which to supply the smaller yards on the south coast and overseas where the fleet was principally based. By 1813 the Victualling Yard at Deptford covered nearly 20 acres. A 10-horsepower steam engine had been installed in the brewhouse; it was used both to grind the malt and to pump beer from the vats. Furthermore, a complex network of pipes carried water from the Ravensbourne Waterworks into various parts of the yard, including the brewhouse, the bakehouse, the pickle-yard and the cooperage. Plugs were installed at various points, in case of fires, and attachments on the wharf-side cranes allowed water to be delivered directly to ships moored alongside. A steam-driven flour mill was introduced in the 1820s and biscuit making was semi-mechanised in the 1830s. =Personnel= Superintendent's House and riverside storehouse. The senior personnel of the yard varied over time. Up to 1809, the Principal Officers of the yard were listed as follows: * Superintendent * Hoytaker * Clerk of the Cheque * Clerk of the Cutting House * Clerk of the Dry Stores * Clerk of the Brewhouse * Master Cooper * Clerk of the Issues These officers related directly to their counterparts on the Victualling Board, leading to a lack of co-ordination and accountability in the yard. In response to this difficulty, a Board of Revision recommended in 1809 that the number of Principal Officers at Deptford be reduced to three: * Agent Victualler (having overall responsibility for the yard's operation, for negotiating contracts and distribution of victuals) * Clerk of the Cheque (financial officer) * Storekeeper (overseer of items in store) with the following listed as Subordinate Officers: The Terrace (built to house the other senior officers of the yard). * Master Cooper * Master Brewer * Master Baker * Master Butcher * Principal Boatswain * Principal Stevedore * Inspector of Works * Porter In 1832 the Victualling Board was disestablished and the civilian Agent Victualler was replaced with a serving naval officer, the Captain Superintendent. In 1868 the yard employed in addition 50 coopers, 7 millers, 21 bakers, 6 blacksmiths, 4 sawyers and 47 other tradesmen, together with 22 storemen and 67 labourers. Later years: the Royal Victoria Victualling Yard Former stable block behind the Superintendent's house. Deptford remained the largest of the home victualling establishments through the 19th century. Its integrated approach to manufacture and storage provided a model for the new purpose-built victualling yards established in the 1820s: the Royal Clarence Victualling Yard, Gosport (which served Portsmouth and the south-coast anchorages) and the Royal William Victualling Yard, Stonehouse (which served Plymouth and later Gibraltar). In 1858, following a visit by Queen Victoria, Deptford was renamed the Royal Victoria Victualling Yard. After the closure of Deptford's Royal Dockyard in 1869 the Victualling Yard expanded southwards into the old Dockyard precincts; by the end of the century it covered a total area of some 35 acres. Brewing had ceased in the yard after the beer ration was discontinued in the 1830s; and live animals were not brought into the yard after the 1870s (though fresh meat continued to be salted on site). The old brewhouse instead became a clothing store, and in the 20th century a whole variety of stores were kept on site, including medical supplies, lubricating oil and acid as well as milk, jam and lime juice. The cooperage, however, remained in use as produce continued to be stored in barrels. A.

The Royal Victoria Victualling Yard closed in June 1961. Some staff (and stores) were relocated to the adjacent Army Supply Reserve Depot (which occupied part of the former Dockyard site). The majority of the old Victualling Yard buildings were demolished; a large council estate, the Pepys Estate, was built on the site. Some historic buildings, all dating from the 1770-80s, were retained and converted for housing or community uses. These include the gateway on Grove Street and behind it the 'Colonnade' (former houses and office, fronted by a colonnaded passageway), the terrace of former officers' houses on Longshore and the two former Storehouses on the riverbank.

The main route of the track had a gauge of and a length of . It was inaugurated on 13 September 1952 as one of many pioneer railways in the Soviet Union and on 20 July 1997 it was temporarily decommissioned. Since 2006 it has operated as a ridable miniature railway for entertainment rather than an educational purpose.  History  In the summer of 1952, the Pioneer Organization and the Komsomol of Alma-Ata built the railway loop, a wooden platform, and a wooden station building in Alma-Ata's Central Park. Initially, the overhauled Kolomna type 63/65 locomotive UP-40 and two self-built wooden passenger carriages were used. The rolling stock was replaced in 1958 by a TU2 diesel locomotive and three Pafawag-built metal passenger carriages. The same year, a new building for the Section Manager and the dual track Komsomolskaya railway station were inaugurated. Four PV40 (PV51) Kazakh railway carriages were acquired in the mid-1980s, and the diesel locomotive TU7A-2921 was acquired in 1986. Both railroad switches at the Komsomolskaya station were equipped with electric actuators in 1993. Pavlik Morozov station was renamed Dostyk (Kazakh for \\"friendship\\") and Komsomolskaya station was renamed Zhastar (\\"youth\\"). In 1995 wireless communication were installed between the stations and locomotives. The Kazakh government railway Kazakhstan Temir Zholy transferred the railway to the city council, which manages Central Park. The City Council suspended operations on the railway on 20 July 1997 due to commercial considerations. Within a month, the locomotive was vandalised and the carriages were removed from the track to be used as sales pavilions.  Current use  Modern rolling stock of the children's railway, 2007 Central Park was privatized in 1999, and the track and one of the stations was subsequently restored. The railway currently operates as a private enterprise using a miniature Italian diesel locomotive built to look like a steam locomotive with three open carriages. A fake tunnel that is too small for any of the traditional locomotives or carriages has been erected over the railway track. Prior to entering the tunnel, actors playing Native Americans sometimes pretend to attack the train. Inside the tunnel, the railway sometimes puts on a puppet show. At the end of August 2001, the wooden Dostyk station building burned down.  Cultural significance  Russian railway enthusiasts complain that the Alma-Ata Children's Railway has changed from an educational organisation, where children and youths were educated to become future railway workers, to a conventional ridable miniature railway, where children are just customers and do not take responsibility for operating the railway. However, it is the only children's railway in Kazakhstan, and its operation and ridership have been stable since privatization.

Early life and pre-census career Riche was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan. She studied labor economics at the University of Michigan, where she earned a bachelor's degree in economics in 1960. She stayed at Michigan for another year, earning a master's degree in 1961. Being female made her unable to obtain interviews at the banking firms she had been aiming for, so instead she worked on productivity statistics at the Bureau of Labor Statistics from 1961 to 1976. In 1976, she married Steven Marston, an economist at Cornell University, and left Washington to move to Ithaca, New York. In 1977, she completed a Ph.D. in French literature at Georgetown University. She writes that the subject is more strongly connected to her census work than it would seem, through \\"narrative structure\\" and \\"the story the data tell\\". For the next 13 years, from 1978 to 1991, she worked at American Demographics magazine, where she was one of the founding editors. She also became editor of another publication, The Numbers News, where she documented numerical trends such as the declining proportion of white men in the American population. In 1983, her husband (by then working at the Federal Trade Commission) was killed in a home invasion robbery in Alexandria, Virginia; Riche was shot as well, and ran screaming and bloodied to the house of a neighbor, but survived the shooting, and returned to Ithaca. In 1991 she became director of policy studies at the Population Reference Bureau, a non-profit organization in Washington, D.C. Census Riche was appointed by Bill Clinton as director of the census in October 1994 and continued there until her resignation in January 1998. While she was census director, Riche was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association in 1995. One of her priorities as census director was the replacement of the Standard Industrial Classification, which she had used at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, by the North American Industry Classification System. Although she cited only personal reasons in her resignation, it was seen as a sign that Congressional Republicans were winning in their fight to prevent the Census Bureau from using sampling techniques to correct for persistent undercounting of minorities and other underrepresented groups. Riche had been among a group of officials pushing sampling, but was frequently frustrated by interruptions from higher-ups in the Commerce Department when she would speak to Congress on the issue.

Later, she became a fellow at Cornell's Center for the Study of Society and Economy.

It aired on CBS in the United States and on CTV in Canada on March 8, 2012. Plot Reese (Jim Caviezel) and Carter (Taraji P. Henson) watch as Don Gianni Moretti (Mark Margolis) is released from prison. Moretti agreed to enter the Witness Protection Program so he could testify against Carl Elias. Reese is also notified by Finch (Michael Emerson) about their newest number: Leila Smith. While Reese and Carter follow Moretti, Finch enters a hospital in order to get information regarding Leila, finding her to be a patient. Posing as a doctor, he gets into the room to question her but discovers to his shock that Leila is a six-month-old safe haven baby. Seeing there are men coming to get her, Finch is forced to take Leila with him. Meanwhile, Moretti's car is intercepted by assassins who try to kidnap him until they are killed off by Reese and Carter. Moretti is then put into protection by Carter and Detective Szymanski (Michael McGlone). Reese and Finch begin taking turns in taking care of Leila, also discovering the hospital has been receiving donations since Leila was found and brought to the hospital. They identify the donor as Adnan Petrosian (Scott Bryce), a magnate. After doing research in his company, they discover the mother is Claudia Cruz, an employee that died a few days ago. Fusco (Kevin Chapman) is told by Simmons (Robert John Burke) that HR needs him to find Moretti's location. Reese and Finch leave Leila with her grandparents but thugs break in and kidnap her. Suspecting Adnan, he breaks in his mansion and confronts him from having an affair with Claudia, which he confirms, making him Leila's father but he claims he didn't send people to retrieve her. However, Finch manages to identify Adnan's wife, Nicola (Kate Hodge) as the perpetrator. She explains that she did it so it wouldn't damage their reputation and due to her contact, she can't call off the hit. Seeing no option, Reese goes to Elias (Enrico Colantoni) for help, citing having saved his life as a favor. Elias' men have Reese meet in an exchange between the thugs and Mexicans for the baby. He manages to kill the captors and take back Leila. However, he is caught by Elias' men, who plans to trade Leila for Moretti. He handcuffs Reese in an ice truck and puts Leila there, planning to kill them both if they don't reveal Moretti's location. After not handling the coldness, he finally gives in Moretti's address. Reese warns Carter of Elias's plan and she has Szymanski take Moretti to safety but he gets wounded by Elias' men and Moretti is taken. Seeing what happened, Carter decides to stop helping Reese and Finch. Reese and Finch have Leila return with her grandparents. Somewhere, Elias meets with Moretti.

Phil Dyess- Nugent of The A.V. Club wrote \\"The possibility exists that the show may fully blossom in the remaining weeks of its first season as it bravely examines the full, dark implications of vigilante justice. The possibility also exists that, if the baby ploy pays off in the ratings, they'll double down on cuteness and get Michael Emerson a puppy.\\" Keysha Couzens of TV Overmind wrote \\"The full episode that aired last night was something that was far beyond what viewers may have been expecting. What happened then that made the episode more than some two men and a baby farce?\\" Luke Gelineau of TV Equals wrote \\"Person of Interest opened up tonight's episode, 'Baby Blue', by continuing the cliffhanger from last week's installment. Even though I still question the concept of M. Elias being recognizable enough of a character on this show for people to remember who he is from week to week, the Person of Interest writers are running with it, so now we're meeting his dad!\\" Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 4.5 star rating out of 5 and wrote \\"Yes, 'Baby Blue' did in fact incorporate some of those adorable moments - from Reese teaching baby Leila to go undercover and using her as a chick magnet to Finch losing her and frantically finding her with Reese's arsenal. True, he should have been baby- proofing that dangerous place aside from creating a play pen made from books.\\"  References  External links * \\"Baby Blue\\" at CBS \\"Baby Blue\\" at TV Guide * Person of Interest (TV series) episodes 2012 American television episodes ","title":"Baby Blue (Person of Interest)"},{"id":"55897543","text":"Mashiur Rahman may refer to: * Mashiur Rahman (politician from Jessore) (1920‚Äì1971), Bangladeshi lawyer and politician * Mashiur Rahman (politician from Rangpur) (1924‚Äì1979), Bangladeshi minister * Mashiur Rahman (adviser), Bangladesh Awami League politician ","title":"Mashiur Rahman"},{"id":"55897546","text":"Kahraba may refer to: *Al-Kahraba FC, an Iraqi football club in Baghdad *Kahrabaa Al-Hartha, an Iraqi football team in Basra *Kahrabaa Ismailia SC, an Egyptian football club in Ismailia *Kahraba Zouk, a Lebanese sports club in Kesrouan, Lebanon *Kahraba (footballer) (born 1994), Egyptian footballer ","title":"Kahraba"},{"id":"55897552","text":"Mansur Khan may refer to: * Mansur Khan (qollar-aghasi), Safavid military commander * Mansur Khan (Moghul Khan) (died 1543), khan of eastern Moghulistan * Mansur Ali Khan (1830‚Äì1884), Nawab of Bengal ","title":"Mansur Khan"},{"id":"55897558","text":"Fran√ßoise de Lansac n√©e de Sainte-Maure de Montausier (1582-1657) was a French courtier.

The emperor Tiberius reprimanded Gallus for his debauched ways, but a few days later the emperor responded to an invitation to one of his banquets on condition that it followed Gallus' usual routine -- and that the serving girls be naked.De Vita Caesarum, \\"Tiberius\\", 42 Besides the notice of his consulate, Gallus appears twice in the pages of Tacitus. The first is in his account of AD 21, when Gallus is reported to have made a speech in the Senate complaining that \\"the vilest wretches\\" would slander \\"respectable citizens\\" then escape punishment for their harm by clutching a statue of the emperor; in his speech, Gallus mentions specifically one Annia Rufilla. (It is unknown if Annia Rufilla had spoken about Cestius Gallus.) His speech provoked a response from the assembled body that forced Drusus Caesar, then president of the Senate, to order Annia Rufilla summoned, convicted, and confined to the common prison.Annales, III.36 His second appearance is in the account of the year 32, in the aftermath of the fall of Sejanus. Tiberius prompted Gallus to read to the Senate a letter he sent the emperor, in which he accused the ex-praetor Quintus Servaeus and the equestrian Minucius Thermus of being supporters of the feared but now dead praetorian prefect. In response to Gallus' prosecution, the two then offered up Julius Africanus and Seius Quadratus as other associates of Sejanus to avoid proscription.Annales, VI.7 Cestius Gallus is known to have had at least one son, Cestius Gallus, suffect consul in 42.

It is a controlled hybrid between Castanea sativa and Castanea crenata (female Bouche rouge √ó male Castanea crenata CA04). This variety produces large to very large chestnuts. It has very good flavor for a hybrid. With Marigoule, it is the variety currently most cultivated in the French chestnut groves because it is very productive (3 tons per hectare on average). Its fruit is bright, light chestnut-brown quickly turning brown and dark brown. Culture The upright tree of moderate height can be planted tightly in chestnut groves (7 m x 7 m), with 200 productive trees per hectare. In addition, its productivity matures quickly. In drip irrigated culture, in Bordeaux, the cumulative production at the age of 5 to 7 years can be between 21 and 40 kg per tree. \\"Bouche de B√©tizac\\" is pollen sterile and is pollinated by many varieties such as Belle Epine (chestnut), Marron de Goujounac (chestnut), Marron de Chevanceaux (chestnut) and to a lesser degree Bournette (chestnut), Precoce Migoule, Maraval and Marsol. This cultivar is not very susceptible to chestnut blight and chestnut gall wasp. However, as an early budding variety it is sensitive to spring frosts. Bouche de B√©tizac keeps its leaves into early autumn. The nuts are also hanging on the tree for a long time and vibrators are sometimes used to aid the harvest. In the southwest of France, it is found up to 400m elevation.

Lee, Hyeon-su, \\"Award Commentary\\", Munhakdongne, Summer 1997: pp 81. Lee's thoughts on fiction that spoke of a cheating husband was a conservative stance that was both alien, and a challenge.

Critic Jang Eunsu, in describing the characters of Singisaengdyeon (Ïã†Í∏∞ÏÉùÎéê New Tales of Gisaeng) described Lee's fiction: ‚ÄúThe high achievements of Lee Hyeon-su‚Äôs fiction are at times hidden by the ‚Äòtastes of her sentences‚Äô.

Our pitiful minds that must adapt to the fast pace and rhythm of civilization, are surprised and startled by the excitement of the sentence that rises within our body like a somewhat familiar monster. (abridged...) As a traditional artist of language, Lee Hyeon-su ties fantastic descriptions and rich dialogue, and tenaciously tells the life journey of the people of the Buyonggak.

In 1986, it originated from a Migoule orchard in Ussac in Corr√®ze. Marigoule (a contraction of Marron of Migoule) is a very tasty chestnut. It should be planted in rather low altitude in very sunny areas and protected from the wind (up to 300 m elevation for South-West orchard orientation or up to 400 m elevation in South-East orchard orientation). Otherwise its productivity remains small. In France, it is grown mainly South of the Dordogne and Lot-et-Garonne for the fresh market production because of the nuts beautiful appearance. Culture As rootstock, it is incompatible with many varieties but compatible with Precoce Migoule, Maridonne, Bournette, Fertil, Sauvage Marron, Precoce Monteil and Sucquette. Tree growth is vigorous but very demanding on the quality of the soil, which must be rich in organic matter. Its fast growth and the quality of its wood make it interesting for reforestation. Marigoule has medium quality pollen. It may have difficulty pollinating itself if the weather is rainy at the end of spring. It therefore requires the presence of pollinators (1 row out of 3 planted with Precoce Migoule). Under dry climate and with good pollinators, it is moderately productive. Chestnuts mature medium-early. The nuts fall in the burr. Nuts are large of bright red brown color that keep well. It is the hybrid that best resists phytophthora. It is also resistant to canker but is sensitive to cold weather and root asphyxia. It takes quite long for trees to bear fruit, which should be considered when planting an orchard.

It is the 18th overall episode of the series and is written by Amy Berg and directed by Charles Beeson. It aired on CBS in the United States and on CTV in Canada on March 29, 2012. Plot Finch (Michael Emerson) and Reese (Jim Caviezel) take on the case of Jordan Hester, who appears to be living a double life with a very small online footprint. They soon discover two Hesters: Reese follows a male Hester (Rhys Coiro) while Finch follows a female Hester (Sarah Wynter), who he believes is a target. Reese finds the male Hester's apartment, and discovers they're making ecstasy while Finch explains to the female Hester what he does and suggests she move somewhere safer. As they do, Fusco meets with a prisoner (Christopher Denham) who was recently part of a similar case, and learns that the woman's name is actually Mary and the real Jordan Hester is the man. At her apartment, Mary drugs Finch with ecstasy, destroys his phone and leaves him to die in a fire; Fusco (Kevin Chapman) rescues Finch as Mary leaves to kill Hester. Reese destroys the ecstasy lab with Hester's help, then follows Mary to a restaurant, where she's arrested and her true identity, Tara Verlander, is revealed. Carter (Taraji P. Henson), who is keeping her distance from Reese and Finch, is approached by FBI agent Donnelly (Brennan Brown), who is also looking for Reese. Donnelly explains Reese's previous involvement in illegal, USA based CIA operations, which the FBI wish to expose, and believe he's now working as a mercenary for Elias. Meanwhile, Finch offers to answer any of Reese's questions about him while under the influence, but Reese chooses not to take advantage of his partner to satisfy his own curiosity.

Garfield and his wife Lucretia. Biography Susan Ann Edson was born January 4, 1823, in Fleming, New York. She was the daughter of John Joy Edson & Sarah E. Barnes. Her sister Sarah Philena Edson (born 1818) married Sterne John Wheaton Underhill. After they divorced Sarah retained custody of the children. Unusual for the time, Sarah retained her name and sued to have her children's last names changed to Edson. Sarah published a women's rights newspaper. Susan Ann Edson attended two colleges, Eclectic College of Cincinnati and Cleveland Homeopathic College. She graduated from Cincinnati in 1853 and then proceeded to earn her additional degree from Cleveland on March 1, 1854. She was one of the first women to attend medical school. Accounts suggest she may have been the seventh woman in the United States to receive a medical degree. After graduation, Dr. Edson opened a practice in either Cleveland or in her hometown in New York. When the Civil War began Edson joined the nursing corps, together with her sisters. She served in Washington DC and also at Fort Monroe, a small Union outpost surrounded by Confederate territory. Dr. Edson also served during the war at the Union Hotel Hospital in Winchester, Virginia. Edson improved sanitation and reduced the mortality rate significantly at the hospital. Immediately after the war, Dr. Edson returned to her home in upstate New York and maintained a practice there. On May 23, 1872, she returned to Washington, DC, where she remained the rest of her life. In Washington, she ran a large practice, and it was said that she made so many house visits that she \\"wore out more horses and carriages than any other doctor in town.\\" Edson specialized in treating illnesses of women. Edson never married. She was lifelong friends with Caroline B. Winslow. They attended medical school together, served together during the Civil War, and both moved to Washington after the war. Winslow and Edson together worked for women's suffrage. Relationship with the Garfields Dr. Edson fans President Garfield on his deathbed Among Dr. Edson's patients in Washington was Neddy Garfield, son of young Congressman James A. Garfield, who had fallen seriously ill. James and Lucretia Garfield grew close to Dr. Edson during this time, and shared their grief with her after Neddy's death. Their professional relationship continued after Garfield's election as president in 1880. Lucretia was frail and required frequent medical attention. Edson became a familiar presence in the White House, as she cared for the First Lady during a bout of malaria in May 1881. Just months later, in July 1881, President Garfield was shot by assassin Charles J. Guiteau. A team of physicians was called to help the president, led by Doctor Willard Bliss. Also called into assistance were Dr. Edson and a cousin of Garfield's, Dr. Silas A. Boynton. Edson was by Garfield's side more than any other physician with encouragement from Lucretia and the children who referred to Edson as, \\"Dr. Edson, full of Med'cin!\\" Although Lucretia insisted that Edson be by Garfield's side, Edson was limited by Bliss. Within a three- month period of medical treatment to Garfield, Bliss did not take Edson's advice one time. Included in this advice was both Edson's and Boynton's opinions on the improper treatment of Garfield in regard to his preexisting conditions. Both Edson and Boynton, from being so close with Garfield, had knowledge about his previous stomach complications which were blatantly ignored by Bliss, causing further risk to Garfield and a continuation of treatment methods that were considered more dangerous given the President's state. As Garfield's state was worsening and Bliss repeatedly resorted to inefficient treatment and held a constant dismissive attitude towards Edson, Edson left Elberon, New Jersey. The remaining physicians, including Boynton and Bliss, worked with Garfield until his eventual death in September, 1881. Following Garfields' death, the team of physicians, including Edson, Boynton, and Bliss, sent in a compensation demand to Congress for their medical services to the President. Edson and Boynton were able to receive portions of the distribution at Mrs. Garfield's request. Initially, Bliss demanded $25,000, Edson $10,000, and Boynton $4,500. Due to Bliss's controversial treatment of the President, Congress disapproved the demand, resulting in Bliss receiving only $6,500 and Edson receiving only $3,000. For the same services, the 6 male physicians that worked alongside Edson all received, with the exception of Boynton, over double what Edson received. Death and burial Susan Edson died on November 13, 1897, \\"caused by an affection of the heart.\\" Obituaries published at the time of her death called her the \\"one of the best-known physicians in the United States.\\" She was buried at Rock Creek Cemetery on November 14.

It can manifest in tremendous feelings of sadness, fear, panic, and distress. In some cases, the phobia can be so extreme that it prevents the individual from living a normal life.  Signs and symptoms  People living with carcinophobia frequently suffer from depression. Sufferers may become reclusive and obsessive over their health. They may feel overwhelmed and fail to carry out their usual functions. The fear is associated with lack of future planning, and an overall poor quality of life.  Causes  Cancer survivors are also susceptible to developing a debilitating fear of recurrence due to their previous experience with the disease. Half of all cancer survivors report a moderate to high fear of recurrence.  Treatment  Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is used for a wide variety of fears and phobias, including carcinophobia. It helps patients to increase awareness of their disorder, and provides ways for patients to cope with their emotions.

Gameplay Dawn of the Dead is a two-player game based on the 1978 film Dawn of the Dead. The setting is a shopping mall on the day after a zombie apocalypse. One player controls four humans ‚Äî two SWAT team members armed with M16 rifles and a man and woman armed with pistols ‚Äî trapped in the mall and surrounded by zombies. The other player controls the zombies that try to either kill the humans, or infect them, causing the humans to become zombies themselves. The humans start in different areas of the mall and must first link up in order to survive. Their advantages in combat are their relatively high speed and their firearms. Zombies move slowly and have less combat ability, but can go berserk, which increases their combat strength; this may cause one or more of the humans to panic, ending the panicked character's weapon fire for the rest of the turn. The zombie player can also \\"hide\\" up to five zombies to ambush unwary humans. The game comes with a rulebook, an 11\\" x 14\\" map of the mall, and counters representing four humans and fifty zombies The rules also include a solitaire game. =Victory conditions= The human player wins if the human team can arm the civilians with hunting rifles, lock all the mall doors to prevent new zombies from entering, and then kill all the zombies left in the mall. The zombie player wins if three of the humans are killed or infected; this requirement is reduced to only two humans if one of the victims is the woman. Reception In the June 1981 edition of The Space Gamer (Issue No. 40), Steve Jackson questioned the game balance, which seemed to favour the human player, both in terms of enjoyment and in winning the game: \\"Dawn of the Dead would be worth the money to somebody who liked the movie. It also plays much better as a solitaire; in a two-player game, the zombie player will feel like a zombie himself before the game is over. If zombie movement had been slightly higher, or if normal zombies had been allowed to stack, it could have been more interesting and better balanced. As is ... pretty counters, but nice try.\\" In the December 1981 edition of Dragon (Issue 56), Tony Watson also found the game tilted in the humans' favour: \\"The game is fast-paced and a fair amount of fun, despite its decidedly macabre nature. It is definitely more fun for the human player, who can run around and blast away at the hapless monsters. The zombie player has to win early, while he has the humans separated and boxed into a corner. If the humans can link up into pairs and get into the open, they can use their high movement values to run up, zap a couple of zombies, and retreat into relative safety. This perhaps is the game‚Äôs greatest flaw.\\" References Board games introduced in 1978 Horror board games Simulations Publications games ","title":"Dawn of the Dead (game)"},{"id":"55898399","text":"Guldsmeden Hotels is a family-owned, Green Globe-certified chain of upscale boutique hotels based out of Copenhagen, Denmark.

He completed his bachelor of arts in English at Indiana University South Bend, where he studied creative writing with David Dodd Lee. He currently teaches English at Warsaw Community High School. Poetry and editing Henn is the author of three full-length books of poems and several chapbooks. His first two books were published by NYQ Books.

For several years he edited and published the literary magazine Fight These Bastards with co-founders Don Winter and Oren Wagner. In a review of Henn's second book, And God Said: Let there be Evolution! (NYQ Books 2012), the editors of NUVO write that \\"Henn pokes fun at everything on the American scene from the certainties of televangelist Pat Robertson and his ilk to the way in which high-minded academic institutions dominate contemporary poetry.\\" They state that \\"Henn is at his best when he's at his most generous,\\" illustrating their view with reference to \\"Letter to a student, just before the Census, 2010\\": \\"he asks the question to a high school student of his, 'Lisa, in essence, are you not immeasurable?'

In an interview with J. Hubner in The Fort Wayne Reader, Henn says that \\"family and fatherhood were big ideas I was ruminating over in many of the book's poems.\\" His poetic career has philosophical underpinnings, as Henn explains: \\"I suppose the only wisdom I can claim about life is knowing what most of the poets are trying to tell us, which is that it has an end. It has an end, and as the poet and essayist Thomas Lynch reminds us in The Undertaking, it's a good idea to maintain an awareness of that. Understanding that we will die encourages us to live with care and attention and kindness, and, if we haven't been, to understand and accept that we've only got so long to get better at this before we're done.\\" Henn was a finalist for the 2017 Jack Grapes Poetry Prize competition.

Swan Farmstead and the Springdale Stock Farm, is a nationally recognized historic district located northwest of Mount Pleasant, Iowa, United States. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013. At the time of its nomination it consisted of eight resources, which includes two contributing buildings, one contributing site, one contributing object and four non-contributing buildings. with Description The district is a farm that was used as a rendezvous camp by the Union Army during the American Civil War. The two contributing buildings are brick farm buildings that were here when the camps were in operation. The Hugh B. and Mary Swan House (c. 1854) is a two-story brick structure that exhibits Greek Revival and Italianate influences. The two-level, brick spring house is a vernacular structure with a gable-roof. While typical in Pennsylvania, this is a rare example of a spring house in Iowa. A large stone was erected as a monument to the two Civil War camps in a southwest corner of the farm. It was placed by the Belle Coddington Tent No. 34 of the Daughters of Union Veterans, on June 8, 1930. The open rolling fields to the east of the house are the contributing site as they were the location of the camps. Four frame 20th-century farm buildings are the non- contributing buildings. Hugh B. and Mary H. Swan are Pennsylvania natives who built the house and banked spring house around 1854. Part of the farm was leased by the Swans to the federal government for use as a rendezvous camp. Camp Harlan was located here from September 1861 to February 1862 and utilized by the 4th Iowa Cavalry. Camp McKean was located here from August 1862 to November 1862 and it was utilized by the 25th Iowa Infantry. A total of 27 rendezvous camps were utilized in Iowa during the Civil War, and for the most part, they were located along the Mississippi River. In addition to these two camps, \\"inland\\" camps were located in Iowa City, Des Moines, Ottumwa, and Oskaloosa. Camp Harlan/McKean was one of five camps in the state that were in operation during rendezvous phases two to four from the fall 1861 to the end of 1862. The other camps include Camp McClellan in Davenport, Camp Lincoln in Keokuk, Camp Union in Dubuque, and Camp Pope in Iowa City. Even though nothing remains of the camps above ground, they are considered well-preserved campsites when considered against the others, which have largely been redeveloped.

Later, Carl returns and leaves two cans of food with a note saying: \\"Sorry.\\" Siddiq watches Carl from the bushes as he walks away. In the episode \\"The King, the Widow, and Rick\\", Carl encounters Siddiq while Carl scavenges outside Alexandria. Carl apologizes for Rick's earlier hostility towards Siddiq, and Carl offers him food and water. Noticing that Siddiq was trapping a walker, Carl asks Siddiq the three questions that Rick uses to judge potential members of his group - ‚Äúhow many walkers have you killed‚Äù, ‚Äúhow many people have you killed‚Äù, and ‚Äúwhy‚Äù - and is impressed with his answers. Carl chooses to lead Siddiq to Alexandria, promising to vouch for him once they get there. En route, they are attacked by a small group of walkers, some which pin down Carl before he can dispatch them; appearing uninjured, they continue on. In the mid-season finale \\"How It's Gotta Be\\", Carl sneaks Siddiq into Alexandria, and they wait in the sewers with the rest of the survivors while the Saviors attack, and Carl reveals that he was bitten by a walker while bringing Siddiq to Alexandria.

They come to find the safest route is to cross through a swamp, and Daryl puts Tara in charge of protecting the survivors while he, Rosita, and Siddiq weed out the walkers half-submerged in the swamp. Later, Maggie decides to allow the Saviors held captive at the Hilltop to have limited rations and supervised time outside their cage, and Siddiq offers his services as a doctor to Maggie.

Later, during the fight, Rick critically wounds Negan, but tells Siddiq to save him as he tells the gathered people that they will start a new world. Season 9 In ‚ÄúA New Beginning‚Äù, Siddiq was part of the supply search expedition inside an abandoned museum in the city of Washington, D.C. and in the course the man was attacked by a walker full of spiders, confessing to the rest of the group his fear for the insect. After finding the wooden car and the agricultural machinery that the Sanctuary needed, the boy helped the rest of the group to carefully pass the car through a glass floor that contained a gigantic number of walkers inside. On their trip to the communities once the mission was over and after discovering that the bridge that connected with them had been blocked by a storm, the survivors without further choice were forced to look for other routes to their destination and on the way the car that They were getting stuck under mud, as a group of walkers approached their location. After he managed to free the wooden vehicle and prepare to escape, Siddiq watched in horror as Ken was bitten by one of the creatures and in an attempt to save the boy's life, he simply couldn't do anything else for him but just see how he succumbed to the infection. In ‚ÄúThe Bridge‚Äù, as the weeks went by, Siddiq trained Enid with the subject of medicine once the girl recovered from her injuries and tested her in the camp that served as the base of operations for the construction of the bridge that connected with all the communities ; watching as Cyndie's injured hand sutures. After noticing Enid's good progress, Siddiq proposed to Rick to leave the little girl as the nurse of the group while he returned to Alexandria to help anyone in need in the community. In ‚ÄúWarning Signs‚Äù, in Alexandria's infirmary, Siddiq was visited by Rick, Michonne and Judith to take a look at the latter about the cough he had; and used the police as another patient to make her understand that nothing bad was going to happen to her. In ‚ÄúWho Are You Now?‚Äù, Six years after Rick‚Äôs apparent death on the Alexandria Bridge, Siddiq has become the community‚Äôs official doctor. Siddiq maintained his loyalty to Michonne and decided to remain in Alexandria to help people in need in the infirmary for about six years. With the arrival of a group of outsiders to their doors after they were rescued by Judith from a herd of walkers, Siddiq quickly treated the wound that one of the newcomers had done to the head and subsequently attended the meeting convened at the church of the place to decide its destiny within the walls. Convinced that the newcomers were not a problem for anyone, Siddiq agreed to allow them to stay in the community; although he eventually changed his mind after Michonne unmasked the team leader about his dark past and the knife he had hidden in his belt. In ‚ÄúStradivarius‚Äù, when Michonne decided to escort the newcomers to Hilltop instead of abandoning them to her fate, Siddiq accompanied the woman on her trip and maintained that she had to allow Magna and her companions to remain in Alexandria, but it made it clear that only I was helping them for their daughter. After arriving at the site where Magna's group was previously camping, the outsiders were sad to discover that the place was razed by walkers and that none of their other companions managed to survive, and while they collected some supplements from the ground, Siddiq found a flute that belonged to Luke and confessed to having played the instrument during his youth. After spending the night in an old warehouse, Siddiq tried to convince Michonne to change his mind about traveling with them to Hilltop and finally informed him that Maggie and her baby had left the community to found other establishments with Georgie. Before being able to explain what happened, the group was ambushed by several walkers and Siddiq along with the rest of his companions defended themselves from the creatures and escaped terrified of the place. On his way to Hilltop, Siddiq was forgiven by Michonne for having hidden what happened with Maggie and was subsequently informed by two community guards that Rosita had been admitted to Hilltop's infirmary after being found unconscious in the forest. In ‚ÄúEvolution‚Äù, once in Hilltop, Siddiq was informed of Rosita's condition after being treated in the community and how a search group made up of Daryl, Jesus and Aaron had left the place to search for the missing Eugene. Repented by the secret he had kept to Michonne, Siddiq again apologized to the woman for what he had done and subsequently visited Rosita in the infirmary only to listen to the warnings of this one that Daryl and his team had no idea what They faced. In ‚ÄúAdaptation‚Äù, Siddiq was one of many people to sadly observe the arrival of Daryl and his team to the community with the lifeless body of Jesus; and quickly proceeded to attend to Eugene of his dislocated leg in his office. While looking for some bandages for the man, Siddiq watched as Rosita left the room to be able to vomit away from others and offered to address her discomfort by stating that she was still recovering from her injuries, but was informed by her that she was pregnant with him as product of the adventures they had before starting a relationship with Gabriel. Later, Siddiq attended the funeral of Jesus organized by the inhabitants of the community and once the funeral was over, the man left with Michonne and the rest of Alexandria's group to return home. In ‚ÄúGuardians‚Äù, when Michonne discovered that the council had hidden her mission of contacting other communities through a satellite radio, Siddiq was part of the meeting and reminded the woman that they needed the Kingdom and the rest of the communities to preserve the survival of Alexandria, but she told him that he would not sacrifice his own people to the dangers that lurked the world to save the Kingdom. Later, when Rosita proposed to Gabriel to talk about the baby that was to come, Siddiq and the woman waited for the priest on the porch of his house and as the future father of the creature, he decided to join the meeting to take part in the future plans they had with the new blessing of their lives. In ‚ÄúThe Calm Before‚Äù, Siddiq is among the group of Hilltop residents who are kidnapped by Alpha, the leader of the group The Whisperers, and is the only survivor of the ensuing massacre. Siddiq returns to Hilltop to tell the heartbroken residents how their friends died as heroes. It is implied that Siddiq suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of witnessing the massacre. In ‚ÄúThe Storm‚Äù, A few months have passed after the massacre that marked the life of the communities, Siddiq returned to Alexandria with the rest of his companions and, with a strong blizzard putting everyone's life at risk, Siddiq was forced to take refuge inside the community church waiting for the storm to pass and with Negan also sheltering inside the place, Siddiq heard the jokes of the man about the false fatherhood that Gabriel was going to exercise with a baby that would not be his; but they were interrupted when the chimney suddenly exploded and prevented them from continuing to heat up to protect themselves from the cold. With no time to lose, Siddiq followed Gabriel's plan to move to Aaron's house and with his companions he tied himself to a rope and entered the storm setting his way to his new refuge. When Negan left the group to rescue Judith from the storm - after the little girl ventured in search of Daryl's dog - and got hurt in the process, Siddiq took care of the man's wounds and left the room so he could talk with Michonne about his heroic feat. Season 10 In the season premiere: \\"Lines We Cross\\", several months have passed since the mysterious disappearance of The Whisperers in the area, Siddiq could enjoy the birth of the baby he was waiting for with Rosita and set off to take the role of father, receiving the help of Eugene and Gabriel with the care of Coconut. Despite his deep happiness, Siddiq was not able to get rid of his head contemplating how his friends were executed by Alpha and began to suffer from hallucinations due to his post-traumatic stress disorder. After observing how a satellite fell in the vicinity of the space and collapsed within the territory of the Whispers, Siddiq decided to lend his help to extinguish the forest fire that had caused the disaster and had no choice but to cross the border that his enemies had marked. In \\"Ghosts,\\" when Alexandria was attacked by herds of walkers for forty-nine hours, Siddiq helped defend the community of creatures along with the rest of his companions and subsequently attended the meeting convened by Michonne to discuss what was happening, although he suffered again of hallucinations that forced him to retire. His disorder in turn prevented him from attending to the wound that Carol had done while defending himself against some walkers and his problems were eventually discovered by Dante, who told him that he understood what was going on and enjoyed a drink together thus encouraging their friendship. In \\"Silence the Whisperers,\\" more hallucinations about what happened in the stable began to dominate Siddiq's mind and prevented him from paying full attention to the scene of the crime committed by Negan against one of the bandits in his attempt to save Lydia from the claws of her abusers; heading quickly to the infirmary and immersing his face against icy water. After stabilizing, Siddiq was part of the council meeting to discuss Negan's fate and was one of those who voted in favor of forgiving the prisoner's life instead proposing to focus all his attention against the true enemy that was stalking them, but when the vote was in a tie with Gabriel being the last one left to vote, Siddiq had no choice but to wait for the priest to give his final testimony and thus apply the measures against Negan. In \\"What It Always Is,\\" when Negan escaped from his cell, Siddiq accompanied Daryl in the search for the prisoner and took advantage of the fact that they were near Hilltop to go to the community and rest. Offering his help in the infirmary of the place, Siddiq noticed the bad state in which Ezekiel was and after examining it he discovered a large lump in his neck due to thyroid cancer that was affecting him, and despite proposing treatments that could help him out from the terrible situation he is facing, Ezekiel opposed and chose to accept his destiny. Feeling compassion for his friend and knowing that he could die at any time, Siddiq decided to help him have a conversation with Carol after so long using his radio and then prepared to return to Alexandria during the night to continue offering his help. in the community In \\"Open Your Eyes,\\" Siddiq realizes that his friend and fellow doctor Dante is in fact a Whisperer, and the one who had forced him to watch the executions of his friends. In the fight that follows, Dante strangles Siddiq to death from behind to protect his secret. In the mid-season finale \\"The World Before,\\" Dante reflects on the events leading up to Siddiq's murder before finally going to prevent him from reanimating. However, Dante only gets as far as closing Siddiq's eyes before they are interrupted by Rosita, who quickly grows suspicious of Dante's behavior. As Rosita and Dante enter into a struggle, Siddiq reanimates and is drawn by the cries of his daughter. However, before the zombified Siddiq can hurt Coco, Rosita manages to overpower Dante and puts Siddiq down by stabbing him in the head with Dante's knife. Siddiq is subsequently given a funeral attended by his friends and family. Later, an enraged Gabriel, who loved Siddiq like a brother, kills Dante in his cell. In \\"What We Become,\\" Siddiq reappears in Michonne's hallucinations, where Siddiq tells him to imagine the sun. At first Michonne is glad to see him, but he blames her for his murder and also begins to blame her for the deaths of Rick and Carl. Siddiq then asks what will happen to his family when he is gone. Michonne starts crying and tells Siddiq that he is her family, but the latter responds \\"this is how it feels to be your family\\". Development and reception Siddiq is portrayed by Avi Nash on The Walking Dead television series. Greg Nicotero explained the significance of Siddiq's first appearance in the eighth season premiere \\"Mercy\\" to Entertainment Weekly, and why Rick is heard saying \\"My mercy prevails over my wrath\\" in one of the layered timelines of the episode: \\"you hear that line in the episode, because Siddiq says it to Carl in the gas station when he's talking about his mom and he was talking about the traveler and all this stuff, and it's Siddiq that says that he's basically quoting something that his mom said. So when you broke it down that way there might even be four timelines because if you think about Rick at Glenn and Abraham's graves, and then you think about Rick on the back of the truck when he's doing his speech so yeah, we always do that because it always gives the audience an opportunity to put some of these timelines together for themselves.\\" The Hollywood Reporter asked actor Chandler Riggs if his character Carl died a hero in the episode \\"How It's Gotta Be\\" for sacrificing his life to save Siddiq - someone he did not know - and Riggs replied: \\"I definitely think so. It wasn't saving Siddiq, it was saving all of Alexandria. He was the reason that they all got to safety ‚Äî because he stalled the Saviors and [prevented] them from finding any Alexandrians with his smoke grenades and he led them away from everyone and saved everyone. It was a pretty cool way to go out.\\" Riggs also joked with Entertainment Weekly that Carl's death \\"was all Siddiq's mom's fault\\". In the season finale \\"Wrath\\", when Siddiq finally tells Rick that Carl was bitten by a walker while trying to honor Siddiq's mother, Erik Kain of Forbes commented that \\"The Siddiq and Rick scene should [have] happened two episodes ago. It was fine, I guess, but felt really out of place.\\" He was promoted to series regular for season 9.

Lange was born in B√¶rum. After his examen artium he started studying theology and he took his comprehensive exam in theology in 1833. However, during his studies he had a strong interest in language and history. In 1834 he was employed as a teacher of religion, Norwegian, geography, and history at the Naval Cadets' School in Stavern. His strong interest in historical sources led him to Copenhagen to study the Arnamagn√¶an Manuscript Collection, and he published several minor works in his Samlinger til Det Norske Folks Sprog og Historie (Collections of Norwegian Popular Language and History; 1834‚Äì1837). Lange published Hannibal Sehested's letter book from 1645. He called for improvements in the book trade and set up a bookshop himself in Fredriksvern. In the late 1830s he made research trips around Norway, and to Denmark and Germany, and he participated in gathering material about Norway's monasteries. He received a stipend to carry out this work in 1843. Lange was named national archivist in 1845. He published his extensive work on Norwegian monasteries from 1845 to 1847. Lange belonged to the circle known as the \\"Norwegian historical school\\" that formed around Rudolf Keyser, Carl Richard Unger, and P. A. Munch, and he saw his mission as collecting and publishing historical source texts. Lange provided the initiative to start publishing the series Diplomatarium Norvegicum and he edited the first five volumes. Lange was also the behind the series Norske rigs-registranter (Norwegian National Registers), a collection of legislation and decisions made by the Danish-Norwegian kings from 1523 to 1660, but he died shortly before the first volume was published. As the national archivist, Lange strove to organize and structure the archives. He also established the Norsk Forfatter-Lexikon 1814‚Äì1856 (Encyclopedia of Norwegian Authors, 1814‚Äì1856) together with Jens Edvard Kraft, published in 1863. A street in Oslo, Langes gate, is named after Lange. Lange had nine children and many further descendants. Among his descendants are his grandson Christian Lous Lange (1869‚Äì1938), a 1921 recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, and his great- grandsons Halvard Lange (1902‚Äì1970), a politician and diplomat, and August Lange (1907‚Äì1970), an educator and cultural attach√©.

Nyland retired in 2012.  Early life and education  Nyland was born in 1942. Her mother was an egg wiper, later becoming a tent, sail and flag maker. Her father, John Johnson (Jack) Nyland was a boilermaker then taxi driver, later becoming the State Secretary of the Transport Workers Union (SA). Nyland went to Gilles Street Primary School and the Adelaide Girls High School. Nyland had determined her choice of career at a young age, writing \\"lawyer\\" on each occasion the school asked to list her intended occupation. Nyland received a Commonwealth Scholarship which enabled her to study law at the University of Adelaide, where one of her lecturers was Roma Mitchell. Nyland graduated with a Bachelor of Laws in 1965 and was one of three women admitted as legal practitioners in 1965. Career To be admitted as a solicitor, Nyland required both a law degree and a period as an articled clerk and she had difficulty finding someone to take her, eventually being taken on by Pam Cleland. Nyland later entered into a law partnership with Cleland, before going into partnership with David Haines in the firm Nyland, Haines & Co which specialised in family law. Nyland was the Chair of the Commonwealth Social Security Appeals Tribunal from 1975 until 1987, Chair of the South Australian Sex Discrimination Board from 1985 until 1987 and then Deputy Chair of the Equal Opportunity Tribunal (SA). In 1987 Nyland became only the second woman to be appointed to the District Court. After her retirement from the Supreme Court, Nyland was appointed in August 2014 to conduct the Child Protection Systems Royal Commission, to investigate the adequacy of the child protection system in South Australia. =Supreme Court of South Australia= In 1993 Nyland was elevated to the Supreme Court. South Australia was the first commonwealth jurisdiction to appoint a woman to the Supreme Court when Roma Mitchell was appointed in 1965. Mitchell retired as Dame Roma in 1983, and it took a further ten years before the second woman, Nyland, was appointed to the Supreme Court. Nyland was the judge in a number of high profile criminal trials, including that of Michelle Burgess and Kevin Matthews for the murder of Carolyn Matthews, Mark Errin Rust for the murders of Maya Jakic and Megumi Suzuki, and sentencing a teenager for the murder of Pirjo Kemppainen. By 2005, two more women had been appointed to the Supreme Court, Ann Vanstone and Robyn Layton. Together they formed the first all female Court of Criminal Appeal in South Australia. Nyland retired from the Supreme Court in November 2012 as a result of reaching the statutory retirement age of 70. Honours Nyland was made a Member of the Order of Australia \\"For service to the judiciary, to human rights and the equal status of women, and to the community through a range of cultural organisations\\" on 26 January 2005.

Afterwards Zhuzihu Ponlai Rice Foundation Seed Field Office and Warehouse was established on 8 March 1928. The area was chosen because it was the operational center of farming management of Ponlai rice and also the center for seed bank, distribution and delivery of Ponlai rice and its related businesses. =Republic of China= The story house building was constructed after the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China in 1945.

The original officers were Jacob D. Waddell, president; T. E. Thomas, vice president and treasurer; W. Aubrey Thomas, secretary; directors, John M. Thomas and M. T. Clingan and the officers named above. An interesting family dynamic was that Jacob D. Waddel married Mary Ann Thomas in Dec. 12, 1917, making him the brother-in-law to the other directors, all children of John Rhys Thomas. The company erected a sheet mill plant at Niles, Ohio with an annual capacity of 48,000 tons of black steel sheets, and made improvements and extensions which permitted of the production of 12,000 tons of galvanized sheets per year. The plant employed approximately 425 men, and had an annual payroll of about $960,000. Offices were maintained at Niles, New York City, Chicago, West Hamilton (Ontario), and St. Louis. This company began a comprehensive housing plan, and invested by 1921 about $50,000 in this way, and would extend its housing operations as needed. It isn't figurative speech to say the steel mills created neighborhoods and cities. It's actually quite literal. Steel companies had real estate subsidiaries that built homes for employees, and in the case of MacDonald, Ohio (Near Niles), US Steel built the entire town, including its city hall, fire/police station and parks. Just after World War II, there was a serious shortage of steel. General Electric needed access for steel for its growing electric supply division. Mahoning Valley Steel was a hand rolling mill, also called a back and forth mill, which did not make the type of steel needed by GE, but the mill did have access to its quota of steel, which GE did need. The president at that time, John P. Hosack, made a deal to sell the company to GE if they agreed to build an Electrical conduit plant on the site, which maintained jobs in Niles. General Electric was forced to divest the supply company in 2006, and the plant was closed by the new owner.

The democracy movements of 2010 can be seen as a precursor to the events of the 2014 Umbrella Revolution.  Historical context  = The Basic Law = Hong Kong, as a former British colony, was reunified with mainland China in 1997 under the concept of \\"One country, two systems\\". While originally a concept with no legal power, a committee consisting of 59 members from different backgrounds and industries joined together after the signing of Sino-British Joint Declaration to create the basic laws of the new Hong Kong under China based on the ideas stipulated in the Declaration and thus gave national legitimacy to the concept. Effective 1 July 1997, Hong Kong was to be treated as fully autonomous from mainland China. This is followed in the Declaration by the promise that \\"[Hong Kong] will remain unchanged for 50 years\\", until 2047. = Democracy in Hong Kong = Hong Kong's chief executive is chosen by an 800-member committee, while its legislature of 60 is half elected and half chosen by interest groups called functional constituencies, While a democratic style of government election is promised in Hong Kong's constitution, China ruled in 2007 that Hong Kong cannot directly elect a leader until 2017 and its legislature until 2020.  Events  = New Year protest = According to figured offered by the Hong Kong police, 9000 people marched to Beijing's representative office. Organizers claim that more than 30,000 protesters turned up to reignite the democracy movement at times when locals were preoccupied with economic issues. A diverse group of organisations joined the march but largely aligned themselves with three headline causes: 'true' universal suffrage, abolition of the small-circle functional constituencies, and freedom for Chinese dissident Liu Xiabo. The exception was protesters opposing the location of a Hong Kong connection to the Mainland's national high-speed rail network through a New Territories village. Protesters carried out colourful banners such as \\"Democracy Now!\\" Some demonstrators held aloft portraits of Liu Xiaobo, demanding the release of the prominent writer and activist. Hundreds of police erected steel barricades and with minor scuffles when they tried to prevent a small number of protesters from storming the office. New year marches are a fixture on the political calendar in Hong Kong. = 2 May protest = More than 3000 people marched from Victoria Park to the Central Government Offices to demand full democracy in Hong Kong in the 2 May Protest. In January 2010, the Five Constituencies Referendum triggered a by-election when five pan-democrats stepped down. The protest happened a couple of weeks before the scheduled by-election on 16 May 2010, during which few politicians tried to turn it into a referendum on political reform that unsurprisingly failed. = 1 July protest = Hong Kong July 1 protest 1 July protests are annual protest rallies originally held by the Civil Human Rights Front. The holiday commemorates the day of handover from the United Kingdom to China in 1997 and the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The 1 July march in 2010 was the first public march for democracy in Hong Kong after the unprecedented acceptance by Beijing of a limited democratic reform proposal by the Democratic Party under a document titled the 'Consultation Document on the Methods for Selecting the Chief Executive and for Forming the LegCo in 2012'. While this was seen by a step forward for Hong Kong, many were disappointed in the pan-democracy camp for going back on their word to settle for something less than pure universal suffrage. As a result, approximately 52,000 people took part in the protest. An anniversary parade was organised by opposition pro-government groups, attended by 2000 people. Several hundred democratic party members faced verbal abuse and chants such as \\"shame on you\\" and \\"you betrayed Hong Kong's people\\" throughout the march to the Hong Kong government headquarters for selling out to Beijing. = League of Social Democrats and the Civic Party resignation = In 10 January, five legislators from the Civic Party and the League of Social Democrats, one from each of Hong Kong's electoral districts resigned their seats as a part of the ‚ÄòFive Constituencies Resignation‚Äô concept for meaningful political reform. Albert Chan, Alan Leong, Tanya Chan, \\"Longhair\\" Leung Kwok-hung, and Wong Yuk- man resigned from the Legislative Council of Hong Kong. The intention was to trigger by-elections by pitting pro-democracy candidates against pro-China ones in hopes for a de facto referendum on full democracy. However, the Basic Law of Hong Kong does not provide for official referenda. Their resignations were submitted on 26 January 2010, with effect on 29 January 2010. They resigned in spite of Beijing warning them not to, Chief Executive Donald Tsang claimed that the \\"so-called referendum\\" had no legal grounding. The by- elections were nevertheless held on 16 May 2010. Following a boycott by the pro-government parties, the five who resigned were returned to the Legislative Council by voters. The by-election was criticised as a waste of taxpayers‚Äô money.  Causes  = Arrest of Liu Xiaobo = Protesters called for the release of the Chinese activist Liu Xiaobo, who was detained on 8 December 2008. He was formally arrested and sentenced to eleven years of imprisonment and two years‚Äô deprivation of political rights on 25 December 2009 for \\"inciting subversion of state power\\" in the manifesto he co-authored, Charter 08. = Electoral reform package = The Central Government unveiled a package of electoral reforms, calling for 10 new seats in the legislature from 60 to 70 of which 40 will be directly elected, the first time a majority of seats will be determined by popular vote. It also called for an extra 400 people to be added to the 800-member committee that nominates and elects the Chief Executive. The bill requires a vote of 40, or a two-thirds majority threshold to pass. Hong Kong's Legislative Council passed the bill on 25 June 2010 with 46 lawmakers, including moderates, in favour. 12 others, including members from the League of Social Democrats and all five members of the Civic Party, voted against it. Opponents view that the bill does not go far enough and does not set any concrete roadmap for Hong Kong's universal suffrage, leaving uncertainty. The pan-democracy camp attacked the conservative proposals as a rehash of those already rejected in 2005, but the Hong Kong government under Donald Tsang said its proposals were \\"more democratic\\", and could not exceed what was authorised by Beijing. The pan-democratic party was split when The Democratic Party opted to vote with the Beijing government, parting company with the Civic Party and the League of Social Democrats. The Chief Executive assented on 29 June 2010, and China's parliament ratified the decision on 28 August. It was the first time Hong Kong's legislature had passed major reforms to electoral arrangements since the city reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997. A previous attempt in 2005 was voted down by opposition democrats.  Reactions  = Mainland reaction = Beijing was wary of upsurges of public discontent in Hong Kong. The Chinese government did not immediately comment after the resignation of five legislators, but it criticised the resignation plan in a statement afterwards, calling it a challenge to authority.

Steinberg is the founder and former executive director of The Bronx Defenders, a community-based public defense office serving low-income New Yorkers in the Bronx since 1997, and the director of Still She Rises, Tulsa, \\"the first public defender office in the nation dedicated exclusively to the representation of mothers in the criminal justice system\\". At The Bronx Defenders, Steinberg created The Center for Holistic Defense, a program that trains public defender offices across the country to replicate The Bronx Defenders‚Äô model of holistic defense. Steinberg has spoken at TED, and taught at Harvard Law School, Columbia Law School,the University of Virginia School of Law, Seton Hall University School of Law and UCLA School of Law.  Early life and education  Steinberg was born and raised in New York City under a Jewish household. After graduating from the University of California, Berkeley in 1978 with a degree in Women‚Äôs Studies, Steinberg moved back to New York to attend the New York University School of Law to begin a career in women‚Äôs rights law. During her time at NYU Law, Steinberg enrolled in a clinic called the Women‚Äôs Prison Project.  Career  = The Bail Project = In November 2017, with support from The Audacious Project, a TED philanthropic initiative, Steinberg launched The Bail Project, a national nonprofit that provides free bail assistance and pretrial support to thousands of low-income people every year. According to Steinberg, the organization‚Äôs ultimate goal is ‚Äúput ourselves out of business, having demonstrated that money and profit should have no role in criminal justice, and leaving behind a blueprint for how to support people during the pretrial process.‚Äù The organization currently works with public defense offices and community partners in more than a dozen cities, posting bail for people in need and supporting them through court reminders, transportation assistance, and voluntary referrals to social services. Assets of $22,547,817 and income of $24,783,751 were reported in 2018. In April 2019, a St. Louis man who received free bail assistance from The Bail Project was charged with fatally injuring his wife after being released pretrial. In response to the incident, Steinberg said, \\"No one could have predicted this tragedy. It‚Äôs important to remember that had he been wealthy enough to afford his bail, or bonded out by a commercial bail bond agency, he would have been free pretrial as well. In times like this, we must come together for this family and keep sight of the need to transform the larger systems that create poverty, racism and violence, including the pretrial bail system.\\" The Riverfront Times, a publication in St. Louis, wrote that The Bail Project had simply posted a bail amount that had been set by the local criminal justice system, adding, \\"If a friend or relative of Scott had posted the bail, no one would be blaming that person for the ensuing tragedy, nor should they. Ditto for a bail bondsman.\\" = Still She Rises = In January 2017, Steinberg launched Still She Rises, Tulsa, a project of The Bronx Defenders and the first public defender office in the country dedicated exclusively to the representation of women with children in the criminal justice system. Oklahoma incarcerates a higher percentage of women than any other state and more than double the national average. Still She Rises brings the holistic model of public defense pioneered by The Bronx Defenders to low- income women in the North Tulsa community. = Center for Holistic Defense = In 2010, Steinberg received funding from the Department of Justice‚Äôs Bureau of Justice Assistance to begin the Center for Holistic Defense, the training and technical assistance arm of The Bronx Defenders. Each year for five years, the Center selected between three and six defender offices for intensive training, including site visits at defenders‚Äô offices and The Bronx Defenders, on how to adopt holistic defense practices. Steinberg has trained over 25 defender offices, ranging from large, statewide public defender systems such as the Wisconsin State Public Defender to small, local groups like the Tribal Defenders for the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes in Montana. = The Bronx Defenders = In 1997, Steinberg and a small group of advocates founded The Bronx Defenders, a community-based public defender office in the South Bronx. The Bronx Defenders now has a staff of over 300 attorneys, advocates, and social workers who represent more than 35,000 low-income New Yorkers each year. By engaging in legislative advocacy, pursuing impact litigation, and offering training and technical assistance to other public defender organizations, The Bronx Defenders bridges the gap between a traditional direct service organization and a policy organization, seeking to ensure justice and dignity for criminal justice-involved people in the Bronx and beyond.

Described by New Noise Magazine as \\"combin[ing] the anthemic arrangements of Manchester Orchestra, with lo-fi washed soundscapes reminiscent of The Radio Dept\\". the band's \\"infectious personality, coupled with relentless hooks and grueling tour schedule, has earned them one of the most loyal followings in DIY music.\\" \\"Gaining a reputation for their relentless touring scheduling, the group has drawn comparisons to dynamic-pop acts such as Manchester Orchestra, Restorations, and Pinegrove.‚Äù Eller (Left), Hogfoss (Center), Barrow (Right) on tour in Nevada (September 2016) The Black Lodge, Seattle (WA) - Sunday, March 25th (2018) The band's debut album (Wye) was premiered on September 8, 2016 by Do206. Eller has been quoted describing the recording process behind 'Wye', stating \\"I just wanted to focus on writing really simple pop songs for this album, so when I was writing the initial demos I tried to strip as much away as I could. I wanted to see what the result would be if we stuck to an ideal that each song needed to be similar to that Nirvana approach of ‚Äònursery rhymes on steroids. I have a soft spot for really big, anthemic, music, so (to me) Wye is an interesting juxtaposition between this stripped down three piece playing really simple songs that have pretty big choruses.‚Äù.

The Grey Estates praised the release as \\"endearing borderline alt- country moments are overpowered by the grandiose sounds of reverb fueled power chords that fill the room. Over it all sit simplistic, poetic-esq lyrics that are just melodramatic enough to fit the mood\\". Seattle Music Insider lauded the tracks dynamic volume shifts and emotional performances, stating \\"as the track crescendos one final time, each instrument remains controlled; this, as it seems, is one of the strongest tools in The Co Founder‚Äôs toolbox, in that they have an impeccable ability to remain together and tight, no matter how loud or soft they wish to be.\\" A music video for Full Stop was released shortly after the single's initial premiere - hosted by Atwood Magazine, the video depicts an 8bit dinosaur attempting to maneuver the difficulties of \\"DIY Tour Runner\\", a fictitious arcade game created by the band in an effort to illustrate the lyrical content of Full Stop. In March 2018 the band made their first appearance at Austin, TX's South by Southwest Music Festival, performing at South by Hikes Fest on March 14. In early April 2018 the band announced plans for their first Full US tour, to be followed by their first string of international tour dates - a 10-day tour of Japan. \\"Quarter Mile\\", the third and final single from \\"gymnasium\\" was released July 12 via New Noise Magazine - speaking to the lyrical content, Eller is quoted as saying \\"Lyrically, ‚ÄòQuarter Mile‚Äô centers around my struggles with depression/suicidal ideation. Mental health has been an ongoing battle for me since I was 15‚Äì16, and the song is meant to speak to that back and forth ‚Äì feeling okay one day, and stuck in a hole on the next.\\" The band completed their first full US tour in October 2018, consisting of 35 shows in 40 days, spanning over 27 states. In December 2018 the band announced their full Japan tour schedule, consisting of 10 shows across the Tokyo metropolitan area, along with their intent to record a 4 song EP in Ellijay (GA) in March 2019.

Fossils have been found in Asia, Africa, and Europe. Classification Hyainailouridae used to be considered a subfamily of Hyaenodontidae, but cladistic study by Sole et al., (2013, 2015) treats it as a distinct family. Two subfamilies are recognized, Apterodontinae and Hyainailourinae. General characteristics Hyainailourids are characterized by long skulls, slender jaws, slim bodies, and a plantigrade stance. They generally ranged in size from 30 to 140 cm at the shoulder. While some measured as much as 1.4 m high at the shoulder with head-body length up to 3.2 m and weighed up to 1,500 kg, most were in the 5‚Äì15 kg range, equivalent to a mid-sized dog. The anatomy of their skulls show that they had a particularly acute sense of smell, while their teeth were adapted for shearing, rather than crushing. At least one hyainailourid lineage, Apterodontinae, was specialised for aquatic, otter-like habits. Range They were important hypercarnivores in Eurasia and Africa during the Oligocene, but gradually declined, with almost the entire family becoming extinct by the close of the Oligocene. Only Megistotherium and several of its sister genera, including Hyainailouros and Sivapterodon, survived into the Miocene. Traditionally this has been attributed to competition with carnivorans, but no formal examination of the correlation between the decline of hyaenodontids and the expansion of carnivorans has been recorded, and the latter may simply have moved into vacant niches after the extinction of hyaenodontid species.

Early life and education  Chadwick, born in Spanish Fork, Utah, was the daughter of Anna Myrtilla (Wray) and Theodore Lee, a Utah Presbyterian minister, and one of eight children. In 1910, she enrolled at Wooster College in Ohio, and then transferred to Stanford University on a scholarship. After college graduation, Chadwick accepted a teaching position in the now defunct city of Metropolis, near Elko, Nevada. After a year, she traveled to China, where her brother Paul Lee was stationed. He introduced her to Naval Officer Joseph Chadwick, who was also stationed there. The couple married in Shanghai in 1921 and relocated to California. They had three children, Theodora, also a graduate of Stanford, Joseph Jr., who also joined the Navy, and David, a pediatrician engaged in research and lecturing and who joined the Navy as well, in its V-12 Navy College Training Program.  School founder  One of her husband's final tours was to San Pedro, California. The couple enrolled their children in local schools, which both parents found unsatisfactory. So, in 1935, Chadwick founded the open-air home school on the front porch of her home on Le Grande Terrace in San Pedro with four students, two of them her own sons. The other two were Mark and Jean Roessler, whose parents Fred and Edna, were early residents on the Palos Verdes Peninsula. Through deeding more than 33 acres from developer Frank A. Vanderlip for a permanent site and the initial buildings paid for by the Robert Roessler family, in 1939, the school moved to a hilltop in Palos Verdes with 75 day and boarding students, and was the first high school on the Palos Verdes Peninsula. Her husband, Lt. Commander Joseph Chadwick, helped run the school. In 1963, the Chadwicks retired. At the same time, the Roessler-Chadwick Foundation was formed and trustees were named. Margaret Chadwick wrote in her 1978 book A Dipperful of Humanity, her emphasis on the school was a \\"dedication to enrolling a student body that reflects a broad economic, cultural and ethnic mix,\\" mirroring the real world and \\"stressing the importance of attracting a student body that represented ‚Äúa dipperful of humanity.‚Äù In October 2018, her youngest son, David Chadwick, 13 months before his 2020 death, was given the 2019 Distinguished Alumnus Award from Chadwick School, from which he graduated in 1942. = Chadwick-Ansel Adams connection = Thirteen pictures by Ansel Adams, which were on display during a January 2011 exhibition at the Palos Verdes Library, came about in 1941 after Chadwick hired Adams to do a three- day photo shoot for her school's fifth-anniversary promotional catalog. In 1942, Adams returned to the campus to shoot a tennis exhibition featuring professional tennis star Jack Kramer. Negatives for some of those prints are in the official Adams archive at the University of Arizona's Center for Creative Photography. Adams also took a portrait of Chadwick and her husband, in uniform after he was called back to duty during World War II. The photo once decorated the archives office in the school's library. The couple originally met Adams during an annual ski trip to Yosemite on which Commander Chadwick would take the then small student body. Found in Chadwick's records upon her death was a letter Adams sent to the Chadwicks in 1974. The Chadwicks, he wrote, ‚Äúinfused the entire organization with a kind of creative drive (and evoked a marvelous human quality) ... it was an unforgettable experience, and I only wish I had done more and better work for the school.‚Äù Also in Chadwick's records were photographic Christmas cards that Adams and his wife Virginia sent the Chadwicks each year.  Books  Chadwick wrote three nonfiction books. The first, Looking at the Sunset Upside Down: The Autobiography of Margaret Lee Chadwick, was released in 1976 by Omega Books. In 1978, Anchor Press released A Dipperful of Humanity: The Chadwick Adventure in Education about the Chadwick School. Her third book, The Lee Family of Spanish Fork, Utah, was released in paperback by Anchor Press in 1979. It outlined Chadwick's Utah heritage.  Personal life  Her husband died at age 77 on August 13, 1970. Chadwick, called ‚ÄúAunt Maggie‚Äù by her students, died at 91 on May 2, 1984. She was the grandmother of actress and singer Kate Morgan Chadwick.

It has a single tubular leaf and up to thirty greenish to purplish flowers and is similar to the tall leek orchid (P. elatum) but has smaller, darker flowers. Description Prasophyllum macrotys is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single smooth green, tube-shaped leaf long and in diameter. Between ten and thirty or more flowers are arranged on a flowering stem tall. The flowers are yellowish-green to purplish-black, about long and wide. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The lateral sepals are joined to each other and the relatively short petals face forwards. The labellum is white and narrowed near the middle, where it turns upwards through about 90¬∞. The upturned part has a wavy edge. Flowering occurs from August to October. Taxonomy and naming Prasophyllum macrotys was first formally described in 1840 by John Lindley and the description was published in A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony. Lindley did not give a reason for using the specific epithet macrotys but \\"macrotys\\" is one of the common names given to the plant Actaea racemosa. Distribution and habitat The inland leek orchid grows in woodland and shrubland between Kalbarri and Lake King in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains, Geraldton Sandplains and Jarrah Forest biogeographic regions.

Educated in China, the United States, and France, he was an economics professor at Sun Yat-sen University and education minister of Shandong Province. When Japan invaded China in 1937, he organized a guerrilla force to fight the resistance war in Shandong, and Chiang Kai-shek appointed him the wartime governor of the province. He became Mayor of Beiping (now Beijing) after the surrender of Japan, but was fired in 1948 when he fell out with Chiang. He survived Chiang's two attempts to assassinate him, but lost his youngest daughter in the second attack. In 1949 he negotiated the peaceful surrender of Beijing to the Communist forces, ensuring the safety of its millions of residents. Fluent in four European languages, after 1949 he mainly worked on translating foreign publications into Chinese. His elder daughter, He Luli, grew up to become Vice-Mayor of Beijing and Chairwoman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. Early life and education He Siyuan was born in 1896 in Heze, Shandong Province. His courtesy name was Xiancha (‰ªôÊßé). His family had produced prominent scholar-officials in history, but his own parents were middle-class peasants. He studied at Shandong No. 6 Provincial High School in Heze, before being admitted to the preparatory school of Peking University in 1915, where he became an active participant of the New Culture Movement. He was especially interested in foreign languages, and in April 1917 his translation of an article on money by Samuel Smiles was published in Chen Duxiu's influential magazine New Youth. He entered Peking University in 1918, majoring in philosophy. He soon joined the Xinchao (New Tide) Society founded by his close friend Fu Sinian, who was to become an eminent educator and scholar. He published many articles in the Xinchao journal. Study abroad He Siyuan and wife Yiwen After participating in the May Fourth Movement in 1919, He Siyuan left for the United States in August 1919 to study at the University of Chicago. In 1922, he and other Chinese students in the US protested at the Washington Naval Conference to demand Japan's return of Shandong Province to China. Deeply concerned with China's political weakness at the time, he abandoned philosophy and shifted his focus to more practical social sciences such as sociology, economics, and political science. He left the US for Germany, and then went to France and studied at the University of Paris. There he met his future wife, a Frenchwoman who later adopted the Chinese name He Yiwen (‰ΩïÂÆúÊñá). Academic and government career He Siyuan returned to China in 1926, and was hired by his friend Fu Sinian as an economics professor at the newly established Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou. He married Yiwen in 1928 and she naturalized as a Chinese citizen. They had four children: sons He Lilu (‰ΩïÁêÜË∑Ø) and He Yili (‰ΩïÂÆúÁêÜ), and daughters He Luli and He Lumei (‰ΩïÈ≤ÅÁæé). While at Sun Yat-sen University he published the books A Brief History of Politics and Diplomacy of Modern China (‰∏≠ÂõΩËøë‰ª£ÊîøÊ≤ªÂ§ñ‰∫§Áï•Âè≤, 1927) and Research Methods in Social Sciences (Á§æ‰ºöÁßëÂ≠¶Á†îÁ©∂Ê≥ï, 1928). He joined the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party) in 1927. In early 1928, Chiang Kai-shek's Northern Expedition army entered Shandong Province. At the recommendation of Dai Jitao, President of Sun Yat- sen University, Chiang appointed He Siyuan as education minister of his home province, which was then ruled by various warlords only nominally loyal to Chiang's Nationalist government. Despite the lack of funds, He Siyuan invested in teacher training and reorganized the defunct provincial Shandong University and the private Tsingtao University into the National Shandong University in 1932. Military career during the Sino-Japanese War After Japan invaded China in 1937 and threatened Shandong's capital Jinan, the Shandong military governor Han Fuju abandoned his army and fled the province (and was later executed). Although He Siyuan was a civilian official, he chose to remain in Shandong and organize a guerrilla force to fight the Japanese. He Siyuan sent Yiwen and their four children to live in the British concession in Tianjin for safety. When the Pacific War broke out in December 1941, Japan occupied the British concession and Yiwen moved the family home to Tianjin's Italian concession. On 31 December, the Italian authorities arrested Yiwen and the children and handed them to the Japanese, who held them as hostages and demanded He Siyuan's surrender. He refused the demand, condemned Japan and Italy's breach of international law through media and diplomatic channels, and held Italian missionaries in China as a bargaining chip. The Japanese eventually relented and released his family. During the Anti-Japanese War, He Siyuan cooperated with the Communist guerrilla forces in Shandong and had contact with the Communist leader Chen Yi. In the autumn of 1944, he reported to Chiang Kai-shek in the wartime capital of Chongqing, and Chiang appointed him as Governor of Shandong in December. After the surrender of Japan at the end of World War II in 1945, he took over the province from the occupiers. Surrender of Beijing He Siyuan and family: wife Yiwen, daughters He Luli (left) and Lumei (right), and sons Lilu and Yili In November 1946, General Wang Yaowu was appointed Chairman of Shandong and He Siyuan became Mayor of Beijing (then known as Beiping), succeeding Xiong Bin. He was a popular mayor, personally officiating group weddings in the Huairen Hall in Zhongnanhai. 60 years later, some surviving couples organized a reunion to commemorate him. He renamed a street in Beijing after General Zhang Zizhong, who had supplied He Siyuan's guerrilla force in Shandong but was killed in action in 1940. During the Chinese Civil War between the Kuomintang and the Communists, He Siyuan clashed with Chiang Kai-shek, who after an attempt in April 1948 to assassinate him in downtown Beijing failed, fired him in June and replaced him with Liu Yaozhang. In January 1949, He Siyuan negotiated with the Communists for the surrender of Beijing. To prevent the surrender, Chiang Kai-shek made another attempt to assassinate him. In the early morning of 18 January 1949, two bombs exploded in his home, killing his 12-year-old daughter Lumei and gravely wounding his wife, who never fully recovered from the injury. He Siyuan and the other children were also wounded. Undaunted, he proceeded with the negotiation and reached an agreement for the peaceful surrender of Beijing, ensuring the safety of its millions of residents and the preservation of the architectural heritage of the ancient capital. The Juntong agent who planted the bombs, Colonel Duan Yunpeng, was captured in 1954 and executed in 1967. Later life and legacy After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, He Siyuan worked for the People's Publishing House and was elected to the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). Fluent in English, German, French, and Russian, he devoted himself to the translation of foreign works into Chinese, publishing 16 volumes by the early 1960s. He also contributed to the editing of the French‚ÄìChinese Dictionary and German Grammar. He died in Beijing on 28 April 1982, at the age of 86. He Siyuan's daughter He Luli became a doctor and a high-ranking politician. She entered politics after practicing medicine for decades, and served as Vice-Mayor of Beijing, Chairwoman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Vice Chairwoman of the CPPCC, and Vice Chairperson of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

It is best studied in fish species that are commonly farmed, in which typical effects of infection include skin ulceration, hemorrhage, and necrosis, with post-mortem examination identifying ciliates in the skin, gills, blood, and internal organs including the brain. Host range Scuticociliatosis has been reported in a broad range of teleosts; it is best studied in those teleost fish commonly raised in aquaculture, where the disease is of significant economic impact. It has also been reported in seahorses, sharks, and crustaceans. The mortality rate is particularly high among flatfish, possibly due to their sedentary lifestyle involving skin-to-skin contact between individuals. Disease mechanism Scuticociliatosis consists of overwhelming infection of an animal's body by any one of around 20 species of scuticociliate. These unicellular organisms are free-living in marine environments but are opportunistic parasites with a diverse host range. It is unclear what triggers infection, although infection rates are known to be higher, in both experimental and aquaculture conditions, in warmer water. Low salinity has also been reported to reduce disease rates. Under some conditions, ciliates have been reported to successfully infect healthy fish, likely through the gills; other reports suggest abrasions or skin damage may be required. Scuticociliates are histophagous (tissue-eating) and extensively degrade body tissues. Histological postmortem examination of affected fish usually reveals ciliates in the skin and gills, blood, and internal organs, with significant damage to the brain and nervous system, which is likely responsible for behaviors such as abnormal swimming in infected individuals. Causative agents The exact species of scuticociliate responsible for a given outbreak is often not identified. As a result, differences in virulence and disease course among different scuticociliates are not well characterized. In one study, infection by Miamiensis avidus was reported to have a higher mortality rate than Pseudocohnilembus persalinus, Pseudocohnilembus hargisi and Uronema marinum. Infections by U. marinum show a less severe disease course, possibly restricted to the skin surface; it has been suggested that this ciliate may be only a secondary pathogen. M. avidus, P. persalinus, U. marinum, and U. nigricans have all been reported in aquaculture settings. Outbreaks Scuticociliatosis outbreaks are recurring problems in fisheries, especially of olive flounder. Outbreaks in both aquaculture and natural settings are more common in the spring and summer, when water temperature is higher. Outbreaks have also been identified in captive settings; in one aquarium an outbreak of M. avidus was responsible for the deaths of six sharks. Scuticociliatosis due to Miamiensis avidus infection is believed to be responsible for a 2017 die- off of fish and leopard sharks found in the San Francisco Bay. Treatment and prevention There is no treatment for scuticociliatosis once parasites have infected an animal's internal organs. In aquaculture settings, chemical treatment of the water to kill ciliates can be used in conjunction with antibiotics.

The American entomologist Arnold S. Menke named and circumscribed the genus in 1977 for his newly-described species A. ha and A. evansi. Taxonomic history In 1977, the American entomologist Arnold S. Menke wrote a paper circumscribing the new genus Aha which was accompanied by his descriptions of its two species: A. ha and A. evansi. Howard Ensign Evans and Robert Matthews had provided him with specimens of this new genus; they had collected them during expeditions in Australia in 1969‚Äì1970 and 1972. Menke designated A. ha to be the genus's type species. Menke only had access to male specimens when writing his description of the genus and both species. Ole C. Lomholdt wrote a description of the female A. evansi in 1980. When Menke named Aha, he placed it in the tribe Miscophini due to its ocelli. Lomholdt argued the genus should be in the tribe Larrini. , Aha is classified in the Miscophini tribe, of the Crabroninae subfamily of the Crabronidae family. =Etymology= The etymology listed in Menke's 1977 paper is that \\"Aha is an arbitrary combination of letters chosen for brevity\\". He later stated his first reaction when seeing one of these new specimens was \\"Aha, a new genus\\", making use of the English interjection aha. Due to its name, it has appeared in various lists and articles on interesting or humorous taxon names. Richard Conniff wrote an article for the magazine Science 82 discussing scientific names for taxa; he ended it with a paragraph on what he called \\"the topper\\", discussing the genus Aha. In 1993, Aha was both included in a list authored by Menke of animal taxa names he considered \\"funny\\" or \\"curious\\" and in an article by May Berenbaum in American Entomologist on creative names for insect taxa. Distribution A. ha's type locality is in Kununurra, Western Australia; all specimens in the type series were found in the same area. The type locality for A. evansi is about north of Ouyen, Victoria. Additional specimens were found south of Ouyen and south of Sherlock, South Australia. Description Lomholdt listed six autapomorphic features of the genus. Both sexes have outer claws which are much bigger than their inner claws. They have a compressed labio-maxillairy complex. Aha neither have vosella nor do they have aedeagal teeth. The genus is also characterized by a medial sulcus on its pronotal collar. The media on its forewing diverges proximally to the cu-a cross-vein. In Menke's key to genera in Miscophini, Aha was coupled with Lyroda. His diagnostic features included the placement of the forewing media divergence, a prementum which was compressed laterally, and claws of unequal sizes.

She established the neurosurgery service at Middlesex Hospital in London, where she gained a public profile for operating on A. A. Milne. Biography Diana Beck was born in 1900 in Hoole, Chester, to James Beck, a tailor, and Margaret Helena Kinloch. She attended The Queen's School before studying medicine at the London School of Medicine for Women, where she won two prizes and a scholarship. After graduating in 1925, she worked at the Royal Free Hospital as a house surgeon and then a surgical registrar throughout the 1930s. She chose to specialise in neurosurgery and trained under Hugh Cairns at the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford, where she also acted as a general surgeon providing treatment to injured soldiers during the war. In 1939, she was awarded the William Gibson Research Scholarship for Medical Women by the Royal Society of Medicine, and used the grant to undertake research in Oxford with Dorothy Stuart Russell. Using animal experiments, they investigated the causes of idiopathic intracranial hypertension and experimented with various graft materials for cranioplasty. Beck was appointed consultant neurosurgeon at the Royal Free in 1943, but the next year the ongoing war forced her to move to Chase Farm Hospital and Bristol to provide neurosurgical advice to the emergency medical service for south-west England. She became a consultant neurosurgeon at Middlesex Hospital in 1947, making her the first female consultant at a London teaching hospital that did not admit women students. At Middlesex, she was the first woman and the first neurosurgeon on staff, as well as being the only consultant neurosurgeon in western Europe and North America at the time. Beck set up and ran the neurosurgery service at Middlesex, and published important research on the management of intracerebral haemorrhage. In 1952 she received attention in the press for performing surgery on A. A. Milne, the author of Winnie-the-Pooh, two months after he suffered a stroke. The Times praised her \\"remarkable piece of surgery\\", but Milne's biographer Ann Thwaite claimed that the surgery left him \\"partly paralyzed\\" with a \\"distinct change in character\\"; he died three years later. Beck suffered from myasthenia gravis and underwent a thymectomy in 1956 to treat a myasthenic crisis. She died soon after the procedure from a pulmonary embolism on 3 March 1956. First female neurosurgeon A 2008 profile in Neurosurgery credits Beck as the world's first female neurosurgeon. The claim has also been made for the Romanian Sofia Ionescu, although the author notes that Ionescu only finished medical school in 1945, when Beck was already working as a consultant in neurosurgery.

It has a single tubular, dark green leaf and up to thirty greenish-brown, white and purplish flowers. It is a very rare orchid, only found in a single location with a population of around 240 plants. Description Prasophyllum milfordense, commonly known as the Milford leek orchid is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single tube-shaped, dark green leaf which is long and wide near its reddish-purple base. Between five and thirty greenish-brown, white and purplish flowers are loosely arranged along a flowering spike which is long. The flowers are wide and as with other leek orchids, are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is lance-shaped to egg-shaped, long, about wide and greenish-brown with darker stripes. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, long, about wide, greenish-brown and free from each other. The petals are linear to lance-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long, about wide and white with greenish or purplish markings. The labellum is white, narrow lance-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long, about wide and turns sharply upwards near its middle, reaching to the lateral sepals or higher. The edges of the upturned part of the labellum are slightly wavy and there is a fleshy green, channelled callus in its centre. Flowering occurs from late October to early December. Taxonomy and naming Prasophyllum milfordense was first formally described in 1998 by David Jones from a specimen collected near Cambridge and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (milfordense) refers to the name of the private property where the species is found. Distribution and habitat The Milford leek orchid grows in grassland in an area near Hobart with below average rainfall for the state. Conservation Prasophyllum milfordense is only known from a small area of a single private property and in 2012, the total population was estimated to be 240 plants. In some drought years, no plants are seen. It is classed as \\"Endangered\\" under the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995 and as Critically Endangered under the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act. The main threats to the population are the activities of rabbits, land clearance, inappropriate fire regimes and changes to rainfall patterns.

The tower was repaired in 1675, but was largely rebuilt between 1898 and 1902 at a cost of ¬£6,400 () by John Sampson of Liskeard. The structure of the church was restored in 1878‚Äì1879 at a cost of over ¬£3,700 () under the direction of Richard Coad, architect, of Liskeard and London, by the contractor Mr. Lang. There was a further restoration in 1890 for the interior. Tencreek cross and Culverland cross are stone crosses in the churchyard. The former was found in 1903 at Tencreek Farm and was moved to the churchyard in 1908. The latter was also moved here in 1908 and is thought to have come from a site near Trevecca.Langdon, A. G.

Loosely translated, it refers to \\"laments\\", but the precise meaning varied over the centuries. Originally it appears to have referred specifically to laments for the dead, but later came to include Buddhist poems on impermanence and even some love poems.  Overview  Aish≈çka is a category of waka (poems in classical Japanese) based on the content of the poems. It is most frequently used in reference to bu- date, division of waka anthologies into thematic books. Aish≈çka most typically are poems of personal reminiscence and lament. In the 8th-century Man'y≈çsh≈´ poems of this type were categorized as banka (elegies). The 9th-century Bunka Sh≈´reish≈´ (an anthology of poems in classical Chinese) used the word aish≈ç (ÂìÄÂÇ∑). Many of the imperial collections include books of aish≈çka, including the Kokin Wakash≈´, the Gosen Wakash≈´, the Sh≈´i Wakash≈´, the Gosh≈´i Wakash≈´, the Senzai Wakash≈´, the Shinkokin Wakash≈´, the Shokukokin Wakash≈´, the Shokusenzai Wakash≈´, the Shokugosh≈´i Wakash≈´, the Shinsenzai Wakash≈´, the Shinsh≈´i Wakash≈´ and the Shinshokukokin Wakash≈´. The word aish≈ç was already in use in the Man'y≈çsh≈´ to describe the themes of several poems. With the exception of one poem describing a banishment, all were laments for the dead. In the Kokin Wakash≈´, the term refers to poems written about the death of a friend or a relative, but by the time of the later Sh≈´i Wakash≈´ it had come to cover poems about the impermanence of things and such poems expounding specifically Buddhist principles. This shift in usage continued in later collections, and by the time of the Shinkokin Wakash≈´ the category included a very large number of poems on impermanence. In the Sh≈´ish≈ç, the term was used to describe six poems at the end of the book of love poetry. The precise meaning and boundaries of what constitute an aish≈çka are not certain and seem to have fluctuated, specifically grown broader, over time.

The wreck site, designated 20UH105, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. History In 1873, lumber and steel entrepreneur Eber Brock Ward commissioned Frank E. Kirby to design this tug. The boat was built by the Wyandotte Iron Ship Building Works in Wyandotte, Michigan. The Sport was the first steel tug on the Great Lakes, and the first vessel made of Bessemer steel in North America. It was designed as a harbor tug, and first used around Wyandotte and the St. Clair River. By 1875, she was assigned to Ludington, Michigan, were Ward owned sawmills. The tug was rebuilt a number of times, and sold to a succession of owners who used it for towing, salvaging and aiding vessels in distress. In 1913, the Sport was sold a final time to Captain Robert Thompson of Port Huron, Michigan. Thompson used it as a fire tug in Port Huron, and for other harbor duties. On December 13, 1920, the Sport set out from Port Huron, bound for Harbor Beach. It encountered a heavy gale, and by 6:00 pm was taking on more water than could be pumped out. The seasick and exhausted firetender returned to his bunk, and the boat lost steam, killing the pumps. The crew abandoned ship at about 11:00 pm, and washed ashore near Lexington, still alive. The wreck of the Sport was discovered in 1987. In 1992, the Sport became the first Michigan shipwreck with her own Michigan Historical Marker placed on her. The wreck is now part of the Sanilac Shores Underwater Preserve, and popular with divers. The marker was damaged and removed in 2002.

Early life Davis was born in Zebulon, Georgia, the son of Jonathan A. and Etta (n√©e Ogletree) Davis. He was raised on a farm and attended Griffin High School. World War I When the United States entered World War I in 1917, Davis left school in his senior year without obtaining his diploma and enlisted in the United States Army Air Service. He graduated at the top of his class and was commissioned a second lieutenant. To his disappointment, Davis was made an instructor, flying a Curtiss JN-4D \\"Jenny\\" trainer rather than fighting the enemy in the skies over France. A superior informed him, \\"There‚Äôs a shortage of capable instructors and you‚Äôre needed here to teach others to fly.\\" He trained under and was a friend of the Wright brothers. Barnstorming and other business activities After his discharge in 1919, Davis purchased a surplus government Jenny, which he named \\"Glenna Mae\\" after his future wife, and turned to barnstorming in the southeastern United States. Eventually he sold the Jenny and bought three Wacos. He sold and repaired airplanes, acquiring a Waco dealership, before switching to Travel Air. He formed the Doug Davis Flying Circus, and through the early 1920s, his barnstorming outfit competed fiercely with the rival Mabel Cody Flying Circus. Eventually the two merged and formed the Baby Ruth Flying Circus in 1924, sponsored by Otto Schnering. Schnering was the founder of the Curtiss Candy Company, which manufactured the Baby Ruth candy bar. Davis had previously worked for Schnering, promoting his product by dropping the candy bars, attached to paper parachutes, from his airplane. In 1923, he created a national uproar by flying low between buildings in the business district of Pittsburgh distributing candy. On the Fourth of July weekend in 1926, he did the same promotion over Coney Island. In Miami in 1927, a candy distributor got Davis to let his 12-year-old son, Paul Tibbets, drop the candy bars from Davis's Waco 9 to the crowd at the Hialeah Park Race Track. It made a big impression on the boy; he later said, \\"From that day on, I knew I had to fly.\\" Tibbets would go on to pilot the Boeing B-29 Superfortress that dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, in World War II. In 1926 or 1927, Davis constructed the first permanent aircraft hangar at Candler Field, a converted auto speedway near Atlanta, which eventually became Atlanta Municipal Airfield in 1946. (The Doug Davis hangar was recreated in early 2015 at the Candler Field Museum.) He set up an aviation school there, the Douglas Davis Flying Service. He also ran a charter service between Atlanta and Birmingham, Alabama, before selling it to Texas Air Transport in 1929. Both the school and the charter service were firsts for Atlanta. In 1930, he joined Eastern Air Transport (the predecessor of Eastern Air Lines) and piloted the first commercial airline flight from Atlanta to New York City the same year. Air racing and death Davis was also an accomplished air racer. In the 1928 Atlanta Air Races, he won or placed second in every race. In 1929, Travel Air got him to race its new airplane, the Travel Air Type R, dubbed the \\"Mystery Ship\\" by the press because its development had been kept a closely guarded secret. On September 2, 1929, he flew it to a win in event 26, a free-for-all speed contest ‚Äì five laps of a triangular course ‚Äì at the National Air Races in Cleveland at a speed of . His civilian airplane was the first to defeat military aircraft. In 1934, he won the Bendix Trophy, flying a Wedell-Williams Model 44 from Burbank to Cleveland (to compete in the National Air Races) at a speed of in nine hours, 26 minutes and 43 seconds. Movie star Mary Pickford presented him with the trophy, while Vincent Bendix gave him his $5400 prize check. At the National Air Races, he complained that the course for the last and biggest competition, the Thompson Trophy Race, held on Labor Day (September 3 that year), was too short ‚Äì rather than the more customary to make the race easier for the audience to follow ‚Äì and that \\"Someone may get killed this afternoon.\\" Davis was leading on the eighth lap, but missed a pylon. He banked to turn around and try to pass the pylon properly, only to stall and crash into the ground, dying instantly out of sight of the 60,000 spectators. The announcer lied and told the crowd he had bailed out. Personal life Davis married Glenna Mae D'Hollosay on December 25, 1925. His son, Doug Davis Jr., was six at the time of his father's death. He would become a successful painter before dying in an Air France Boeing 707 crash on takeoff from Orly Field, Paris, on June 3, 1962, at about the same age as his father. Honors Plaque of Davis at the Georgia Aviation Hall of Fame Davis was inducted into the OX5 Club of America Hall of Fame in 1972 and the Georgia Aviation Hall of Fame in 1991.

Handicapped by a low power, unreliable engine, its flying life lasted little more than a month. Design and development Light aircraft design was slow to start in Poland but from 1924 the Airborne and Antigas Defence League, generally known by their Polish acronym L.O.P.P., began to fund amateur builders. One of the first successful bidders was Jozef Medwecki, an aircraft designer with the Samolot company. The result was the HL 2 two-seater which Medwecki built, with Samolot's approval, in their factory in his spare time. It was finished in August 1927. The HL 2 had a parasol wing with a quite thick section and a plan that was strictly rectangular apart from a central trailing edge cut-out to improve the pilot's field of view. The wing was in two parts, built around pairs of wooden spars and ply-covered. It was supported over the fuselage on cabane struts, one leaning back from the upper central fuselage to the forward strut and the other a vertical inverted V-strut to the rear spar; the principal bracing members were parallel steel tubes from the lower fuselage longerons to the spars. Medwecki's greatest problem was to obtain a suitable engine and in the end had to settle for an elderly, three-cylinder Anzani lent to him by Samolot, which left the HL 2 seriously underpowered. It was installed in a simple, flat-sided metal cowling with its cylinder heads exposed for cooling. The cowling widened rearwards to match the dimensions of the HL 2's simple, rectangular section fuselage which was built around four wooden longerons and ply covered. Behind the fuel tanks the open cockpits were in tandem and fitted with dual control. The forward one was under the wing and was entered via a car-type door with a special lock to insure integrity of the upper longeron and the rear one, conventionally entered, was under the trailing edge cut-out. The HL 2's strut-braced tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage and, like the elevators, was essentially rectangular in plan. The fin was triangular and carried a rectangular rudder. Its fixed undercarriage had mainwheels on a single axle with rubber cord shock absorbers and supported at each end by a V-strut to the lower fuselage longeron. There was a short tailskid under the fin. The HL 2 made its first flights in September 1927 from Samolot's home ground of Poznan-Lawica, flown by Wladyslaw Szulczewski. Despite the lack of power it was capable of aerobatics. It was entered as a competitor in the L.O.P.P.-organised First National Lightplane Contest held at the start of October in Warsaw but engine problems on the way there caused it to fail to meet the deadline. Nonetheless, Szulczewski took part as an unofficial contestant and at first its performance was outstanding but during a cross-country flight the engine failed again. The HL 2 was seriously damaged in the consequent emergency landing and never flew again.

The hashtag generated a total of 40,706,392 tweets from October 24 to 25, 2015.  \\"Kalyeserye\\" plot  At the start of this \\"Kalyeserye\\" episode, Lola Nidora (Wally Bayola) announces that she will allow a no-restrictions policy during Alden (Alden Richards) and Yaya Dub (Maine Mendoza) meetings as long as they trust each other for the sake of love. After the announcement, Lola Nidora together with her two other sisters: Lola Tidora (Paolo Ballesteros) and Lola Tinidora (Jose Manalo) reminisce about their younger years. Their younger version were portrayed by Pauleen Luna (Nidora), Patricia Tumulak (Tidora), and Julia Clarete (Tinidora). Back at the mansion of the three Lolas, Lola Nidora received a mystery call telling her that the Riding in Tandem was on the way to the bungalow (the Philippine Arena) to ruin the show. The secret diary is in the hands of the Riding in Tandem. Meanwhile, Alden is making his way to the bungalow of Lola Nidora. In the bungalow, Lola Nidora recollects about her past relationships. She begins with Alberto (the parody version of Albert Einstein), moving on to Antonio (parody version of Antonio Luna), then Ferdinand (parody version of Ferdinand Magellan) and finally Anselmo, whom Lola Nidora had carried away with him. However, her mother was not in favor of Anselmo, until she had met Miguel de Explorer, whom Lola Nidora really loves. Lola Nidora continues her story explaining the family tree of the de Explorer clan. Suddenly, DuhRizz arrives and she says that she really loves Alden but hates Yaya Dub but she later apologizes about her mistakes to them. Rihanna enters the scene and she calls her chat mate Harry, but Lola Nidora orders Rihanna to get the juice for her and DuhRizz. Lola Nidora tells DuhRizz that she can still find her true love, regardless of her social status, her beauty or her education background. Lola Nidora then calls Yaya Dub. Yaya Dub arrives alongside with Bae-by Baste and Yaya Luvs. Alden finally arrives, bringing a box of roses and a box containing a missing glass slipper. This was the same slipper that Yaya Dub left after her first \\"Bulaga pa More! Dabarkads Pa More!\\" performance on August 12 of that same year. Alden slowly enters and finally comes face to face with Yaya Dub. Lola Nidora enters the scene and lectures the couple about true love that waits for the right time and later proclaims that this is the right time for them. Then, the couple hugs Lola Nidora. Both Alden and Yaya Dub deliver their messages together. Lola Tidora and Lola Tinidora arrive and tell the couple to have their first dance together, but before their dance, Alden puts the missing slipper on the foot of Yaya Dub. Afterwards, the Riding in Tandem arrives in the scene and Alden chases them to the car park. Suddenly, Frankie Arenolli arrives, wearing an outfit filled with logos of known brands (actual sponsors for the event), while Yaya Dub and Alden run away. Frankie delivers a short speech and claims that Yaya Dub should have become his wife. As the show almost come to a close, Lola Tidora notices that Lola Nidora is missing. Lola Nidora and the Rogelios are at the car park, fighting off the Riding In Tandem and Nidora successfully retrieves her secret diary from one of the riders.  Production and airing  During the October 17, 2015 episode of \\"Kalyeserye,\\" Wally Bayola through his Lola Nidora character announced that the AlDub love team will meet at Philippine Arena with no restrictions on October 24, 2015. He further explained that the special event, which Lola Nidora called \\"Tamang Panahon\\" (or Right Time), was for a cause and 100% of the ticket sales would go to the construction of AlDub libraries that would benefit three elementary schools. In just minutes after the availability of the tickets for \\"Tamang Panahon\\" event was announced, the website of the ticket provider, TicketWorld, crashed according to the posts of some netizens, Three hours later, TicketWorld said that ticket sales for the \\"Tamang Panahon\\" benefit concert broke records for first day sales and the only available tickets are for the Level 4 prize zone. After three days, all tickets were sold out. On October 24, 2015, attendees were allowed to enter the venue, the Philippine Arena, at 6:00 am. There has been a pre-show at the venue that started at 10:00 am, which includes front act performances and other activities that were hosted by Valeen Montenegro and Jerald Napoles. At 11:30 am, \\"Tamang Panahon\\" was shown live via GMA Network in the Philippines and was also beamed live in other countries such as the United States, Canada, and New Zealand. The live broadcast lasted for about three and half hours without any commercial breaks. This Eat Bulaga! special episode is also the 87th episode of its \\"Kalyeserye\\" segment. \\"Tamang Panahon,\\" being an Eat Bulaga! episode, is produced by TAPE Inc. with Antonio P. Tuviera as its producer and Malou Choa-Fagar as the overall in-charge of production. It was directed by Poochie Rivera with all the regular crew and production team of Eat Bulaga! including Jenny Ferre as its creative head. This event was hosted by its regular hosts, which headlined by Tito Sotto, Vic Sotto, and Joey de Leon.

Performances  The show started with Wally Bayola's Lola Nidora character entering the premises of the Philippine Arena through a helicopter. After entering the venue, Lola Nidora together with her Rogelios danced through the tune of Dawin's \\"Dessert\\". After which, Lola Tidora (Paolo Ballesteros) performed the songs from Mariah Carey and Regine Velasquez. Then, Lola Tinidora also danced \\"Mambo No. 5\\" by Lou Bega. The next dance number was performed by Pauleen Luna, Patricia Tumulak, and Julia Clarete. In their The Great Gatsby inspired performance, they played the younger versions of Nidora, Tidora, and Tinidora. Later in the show, musical artists sang AlDub theme songs. Those singers were Raymund Sarangay of Silent Sanctuary who sang \\"Sa 'Yo\\", Medwin Marfil of True Faith who sang \\"Dahil Ikaw\\", Jireh Lim who sang \\"Buko\\", Joey Generoso of Side A who sang \\"Forevermore\\", and Tito Sotto, Vic Sotto, and Joey de Leon who sang \\"Ngiti\\", a Ronnie Liang original. Before the highlight of the event, Maine Mendoza danced to Big Bang's \\"Fantastic Baby\\", which was followed by a dance number by Ryzza Mae Dizon and then another dance number by Baste who danced to Psy's \\"Gentleman\\".

Later on, the highlight of the event, the meeting of Alden Richards and Yaya Dub (the character of Maine Mendoza), followed as they performed Ed Sheeran's \\"Thinking Out Loud\\" and Bryan White's \\"God Gave Me You\\". Yaya Dub who usually lip synced songs and film lines and did not actually speak in the previous episodes of the \\"Kalyeserye\\" segment spoke for the first time in this event. At the end of the event, Alden and Yaya Dub danced together with other hosts of Eat Bulaga! Aside from song and dance numbers, there were also \\"Kalyeserye\\" skits, which included the switching portrayals of Wally Bayola's characters namely Lola Nidora, DuhRizz, and Rihanna. Frankie Arenolli, one of Jose Manalo's character, performed a dance number at the very end of the show where his outfit was filled with logos of advertisers. It served as product placement in lieu of the no commercial break rule of the show.  Fundraising  \\"Tamang Panahon\\" is not only a special episode of Eat Bulaga! but also a benefit concert. It was intended to raise funds for the construction of AlDub libraries that benefited schools and Lumads. All the ticket sales of the event were allotted to charity. Tickets were already sold out after three days of the announcement of its availability according to TicketWorld, the handler for selling the tickets of the event. Other people who were not able to buy tickets still donated for the cause. After the first production number of the event, it was made public that the benefit show raised . Two months after the event was aired, some of the AlDub libraries were already fully constructed in the schools at Laguna, Capiz, and Iligan City. In October 2016, Maine Mendoza herself turned over the AlDub library project to one of the beneficiaries in Cebu.

Simulating the behavior of a battery during the charging process.  History  A battery simulator has the purpose to check that the battery charger works properly so that the battery charge is effective. The proper maintenance of the batteries helps to optimize their life cycle, with the charger being the team in charge of recharging the battery until the energy extracted is completely recovered. So checking that the charging operation is carried out properly means that the battery is charged faster and that it takes more time to discharge The battery simulator eliminates the need to connect a battery to the charger to be able to test it and allows to know the state of the battery to perform a better maintenance and the necessary repairs, optimizing the daily capacity and the useful life of the battery.  Uses  A Battery simulator has these uses: * Test battery chargers (current or voltage of any kind) eliminating the need to connect a battery to the charger to test it; simulates the behavior of a battery during the charging process and allows the technician the ability to perform complete tests quickly, safely and accurately any charger. * To thoroughly test battery chargers quickly without actually waiting for the battery to charged or discharged. * To test a battery-powered systems by replacing the real battery with a simulator. * To simulate the battery‚Äôs state-of-charge as the battery is being charged or discharged.  Characteristics  Highlights in the battery simulator are the IGBT or MOSFET high frequency regulator (which allows the equipment to work with constant current and voltage), the programmable digital panel. On the front panel of the equipment there may be the following elements: * Digital voltmeter * Analogue ammeter * Test voltage selector * Potentiometer fine tension adjustment. * Potentiometer current selection (0-200 A) * self-test * automatic stop in case of failure. * It has thermal protection of all electronic components and the resistance bank in case of overtemperature (for example: if there are problems in the fans or air ducts clogged the equipment goes to stand-by mode).  Functioning  Battery simulator mimics a battery‚Äôs electrical characteristic of outputting a voltage and able to source as well as sink current. A battery simulator is a special kind of power supply that can output positive voltage while can sink and source current. This type of power supply is called two-quadrant power supply. In contrast, a conventional power supply can only source current when the voltage is positive. Battery simulator able to set the simulated battery voltage either remotely via PC or manually. Often battery simulator has built- in voltage and current display and monitoring. For example the user selects the voltage of the battery to be simulated, using the potentiometer (knob) for adjusting the voltage, while the current value is displayed on the digital screen. An independent potentiometer is available to select the maximum current that the equipment can source or sink. = Battery Charger Testing = The basic use of battery simulator is replacing a real battery with a simulator. This is enables the testing of the charger quickly both at the bench during development stage and production testing at mass production stage. The simulator can change the emulated battery voltage at the touch of button or the turn of knob. If a real battery is used, it will take much longer for the battery voltage to change. For example, a battery simulator can easily adjust its voltage over the range of 0V to 4.2V to test a lithium-ion battery charger. Battery simulator is powerful and convenient tool for testing battery chargers. Lithium ion charger voltage/current profile obtained using a battery simulator. Once the simulated battery voltage is set, the user connects the charger to be tested to the input of the simulator. The charger will detect that a battery has been connected and the charging process will begin. The simulator keeps the voltage constant at the set value, while the analogue ammeter indicates the charging current. If the battery simulator has current limit feature and if the current exceed the maximum set value, the simulator automatically increases the voltage to limit the current The advantage a battery simulator is its ability to freely set the emulated battery voltage to any value in order to test the charger. For example, a real charger profile curved is obtained by sweeping the simulator voltage while recording its voltage and current. The figure to the right shows a typical Lithium ion charging profile curve obtained by using a battery simulator. The profile curve of the charger is obtained in a few minutes. = Input Power = Battery simulator AC input voltage requirement is typically universal voltage (85-135 or 180-250 VAC), and the frequency is 50 or 60 Hz.

After initially taking up tanka in his teens, he studied under Kun'en Kaneko, and when in attendance at Waseda University he socialized with other notable Naturalist poets such as Bokusui Wakayama. Later, he earned the respect of the famous poet Takuboku Ishikawa, with whom he corresponded until the latter's death in 1912.  Biography  Zenmaro Toki was born in 1885. He was born in Tokyo. He first took up tanka composition in middle school. He became a disciple of , a minor poet who had studied under Ochiai Naobumi and who, according to historian and critic Donald Keene, never fulfilled his early potential. Kun'en experimented with just about every tanka school, and the characteristic that critics have traditionally associated with him is his having been a \\"city poet\\". This was likely a characteristic that attracted Zenmaro to him, as the two shared little else in common. Zenmaro attended Waseda University, where he fraternized with Bokusui Wakayama and other poets. He also studied European literature extensively. Upon graduation, he found work as a journalist. His talent as a poet first garnered attention in 1910 when he published Nakiwarai (\\"Smiling Through the Tears\\"), a collection of 143 poems written entirely in roman letters, in three-line stanzas. Takuboku Ishikawa praised this work as being unlike that of any other tanka poet of the day; although the poems were written in classical Japanese, their subject- matter was drawn from everyday life in a manner typical of the Naturalist poets. The three-line form Zenmaro's collection pioneered was soon thereafter adopted by Takuboku. He adopted mild socialist tendencies in the 1910s, and when, in the 1930s, the militarist government began to crack down heavily on left-wing literature, he shifted over to writing scholarly works rather than produce propaganda. He wrote for the Asahi Shimbun from 1918 to 1940. Zenmaro died in 1980.

It mixes Ealing comedy and the light music of the 1940s with a dystopian setting inspired by George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. Writing According to Mitchell, in the mid 1990s, the two writers were working on a different project, when Reeve handed him a chocolate ginger nut, 'sparking a quip about the ‚Äòministry of biscuit ideas‚Äô from which the entire musical was born.'Louise Carey, 'The Ministry of Biscuits', Daily Brighton website, 29 November 2017. From the first draft, Mitchell knew that the plot was so absurd that it could only be staged as a musical. He told Daily Brighton that, though he had studied music at University, he had a piano that he hadn‚Äôt touched for ‚Äòseven years‚Äô, but as soon as he began working on The Ministry of Biscuits, ‚Äòmusic started to bubble out of me‚Äô. Mitchell's score was inspired by British Light Music and the Ealing comedy scores. The overall effect, Mitchell says, 'is as if Georges Auric, after writing the score for Passport to Pimlico, ‚Äòhad not stopped and had written a load of songs‚Äô. Philip Reeve has written on his blog that 'The Ministry of Biscuits was the moment when I found my feet as a writer. I knew while we were working on it that it was better than anything I‚Äôd done before. I suppose I could say that I had finally ‚Äòfound my own voice‚Äô.'www.philip- reeve.com/the-ministry-of-biscuits/ Plot David Mounfield, Brian Mitchell and Murray Simon in The Ministry of Biscuits at Brighton Open Air Theatre, 6 July 2018 The story is set in a parallel grim post-war Britain of the late 1940s, where The Ministry of Biscuits aims to 'control biscuits, and to control the idea of biscuits.' It prohibits decadent sweetmeats, such as the Gypsy Cream and the Jaffa Cake. The hero, Cedric Hobson, a meek junior biscuit designer working on the recipe for a thinner, drier Rich Tea Finger, falls in love with his new French secretary, Fran√ßoise Celestine Courvoisier. He resolves to win her heart by creating a biscuit 'to shake confectionery to its very foundations'. Production and reception The musical was first produced by Quirk Theatre and Film during the 1998 Brighton Fringe Festival, where it was staged at the Pavilion Theatre.UK Theatre web listing for the Ministry of BiscuitsThe cast comprised Nicholas Quirke (the Minister), Sam Hewitt (Cedric Hobson), Joanna Neary (Francoise Courvoisier), David Mounfield (Babbington) and Claire Raftery (Dr Wischwinge/Radio Announcer). The live score was performed by the Janski String Quartet under the direction of Jason Pegg. Clea Smith and Briony McIlroy appeared as dancing biscuits. In her review in The Stage, Jan Whitehead wrote, 'What an absolute ripping yarn - a top hole musical comedy without a sniff of Lloyd Webber anywhere....This fringe show played to full houses at the Pavilion and was a festival gem.'Jan Whitehead, review of The Ministry of Biscuits, The Stage, 11 June 1998 Amy Sutton and Murray Simon in The Ministry of Biscuits at Brighton Open Air Theatre, 6 July 2018 In 1999, the show went on tour to the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre, Guildford; The Miskin, Dartford; The Library Theatre, Eastbourne; The Brook, Chatham; Trinity Theatre and Arts Centre, Tunbridge Wells; Riverhouse Barn, Walton-on- Thames; and Gilded Balloon 2 for the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. In the Edinburgh Evening News, Liam Rudden reviewed an Edinburgh show: 'This musical is probably the silliest thing on the fringe. And it's the freshest comedy in years. Absolutely hilarious, it's played with complete conviction by a totally professional company in the style of an Ealing comedy.'Ian Rudden, review of The Ministry of Biscuits, Edinburgh Evening News, 26 August 1999 In a 2005 revival, at the Sallis Benney, Brighton, Ian Shaw played the Minister and Peta Taylor played Dr Wischwinge and the Radio Announcer. The music was performed by a piano quintet comprising Andy Smith, from Hot Chocolate, on piano with the Giddey Quartet. The musical director was Stephen Wrigley.

Born in Brazil to Welsh parents, she moved to England as a teenager and trained in surgery after qualifying as a doctor. She spent most of her career as a consultant neurosurgeon at North Manchester General Hospital and as a researcher at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. She specialised in treating disorders of the cerebral circulation, spina bifida, and hydrocephalus. Early life Carys Bannister was born in Recife, Brazil, in 1935. Her parents were Welsh and had moved from Aberystwyth to Brazil when her father took up an engineering job with the Great Western Brazilian Railway. After Carys was born, the family moved to S√£o Paulo and later Rio de Janeiro, where Carys and her sister attended an American school. When their father was assigned to work in the Brazilian countryside, both daughters were sent back to Britain; Carys was fifteen at the time. She was educated at a boarding school in Bramley, Surrey and Guildford County Technical College. In 1953, she won a state scholarship and successfully applied to Charing Cross Hospital Medical School, graduating in 1958. Career Bannister began working as a house surgeon in 1958. She first started working in neurosurgery at Birmingham Accident Hospital, where she treated patients with head injuries. She then spent six months in Edinburgh at the Western General Hospital and the Royal Infirmary. She passed the fellowship exams of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh before beginning a postgraduate degree in neurophysiology at Somerville College, Oxford; her research involved the use of electrophysiology to study motor neurons. After completing the degree, she joined the Leeds General Infirmary department of neurosurgery, where she developed a technique known as extracranial‚Äìintracranial bypass to increase blood flow to the brain in patients with intracranial aneurysms and cerebral ischaemia. In the 1970s, Bannister moved to Manchester, where she was appointed a consultant at North Manchester General Hospital and Booth Hall Children's Hospital. She maintained a research laboratory at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology; her main research interests were the brain's blood supply and congenital disorders of the central nervous system. The latter led her to establish a fetal management unit at St Mary's Hospital, where she saw pregnant patients whose children had spina bifida and hydrocephalus. She retired in 2001. Honours Bannister received an OBE in 1999 for her services to neurosurgery in Manchester. She was awarded an honorary DSc by the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology in 2001 for her research on hydrocephalus. Personal life Bannister was a rally car driver in her free time. She owned a property in the Rossendale Valley where she kept numerous farm animals; she also owned six corgis which she exhibited in dog shows. She died on 20 August 2010 in Burnley.

Edo period, mid-19th century Porcelain jar, with decoration transfer-printed in blue under a transparent glaze.

It is of the sometsuke (Êüì‰ªò) blue and white pottery type, but notable for using the English technique of transfer printing.  History  In Japan, transfer printing by copperplate was attempted at the end of the Edo period. This technique was used in Mino's Risen ware (ÈáåÊ≥âÁÑº) from Mizunami, Gifu and Owari's Kawana ware from Nagoya. In the Buddhist temple K≈çjaku-in (È¶ôÁ©çÈô¢) compound in Kawana village, a kiln was opened in the middle of the Kaei era (1848‚Äì54) by Kato Shinshichi (Âä†Ëó§Êñ∞‰∏É), who was a disciple of the third generation Kawamoto Jihyoe (‰∏â‰ª£Â∑ùÊú¨Ê≤ªÂÖµ) from Seto. http://www.pref.aichi.jp/touji/collection/08/collection/12.html Regular sometsuke ware was initially produced, however craftsmen from Seto protested against it. In reaction Kato Shinshichi tried a new direction by producing items with copper plate transfer printing. In Europe the transfer printing technique for ceramic ware was developed in the 18th century. This technique enables the production of patterns of consistent quality. The size of the kiln and the resulting production volume at K≈çjaku-in was small and sales numbers were commercially limited. The kiln operated until 1888. In Japan only starting in Meiji 20 (1887) did large-scale industrial production commence in Hizen.

She received a doctorate from the same university in 1972, and a second doctorate from the University of Pennsylvania in 1984. She later became a professor of social and cultural anthropology at the University of Complutense. Her field research took place in Spain and Portugal, in the towns of Asturias, √Åvila, and Evora. C√°tedra's early work in Asturias in the 1970s examined perceptions of death, suicide, and the afterlife in the community, and made use of techniques from symbolic anthropology. This project would have an influence on later studies of death and suicide in the region. C√°tedra later moved to working in √Åvila, where she analyzed the political aspects of the saints of the town. For this project, she used both fieldwork and analysis of documents from archive sources.

Laverick was the first female deputy secretary of the Institution of Electrical Engineers (now the Institution of Engineering and Technology) and president of the Women's Engineering Society. She was the first woman to receive a PhD in a scientific curriculum at Durham University, and was awarded an OBE in 1993.  Early life and education  Laverick was born in Amersham, England in 1925. Her father was a chemist and her mother assisted her father with clerical work. She attended a local grammar school, Dr Challoner's, and took a higher school certificate in physics, maths, French and English. There was an age barrier to attending university at this time so after completing her A levels, Laverick took a job as a technical assistant in the Civil Service at the Radio Research Station in Ditton Park. In 1943 Laverick undertook a bachelor's degree in radio and physics at Durham University. She stayed on at Durham to undertake a PhD researching dielectric measurements at audio frequencies using a differential transformer, and in 1950 became the first woman to receive a PhD in a scientific discipline from Durham University.  Career  Laverick remained at Durham as a research assistant for a year, and was then hired by Sir Robert Clayton at GEC Stanmore (Marconi Defence Systems Ltd.) where she worked as a microwave engineer. Her then husband was also employed at GEC Stanmore. At this time there were five or six female mathematicians, physicists and engineers at GEC Stanmore, alongside several hundred male employees. In 1954 Laverick moved to Elliott Automation (part of Elliot Brothers) as a microwave engineer, gaining commercial experience in microwave instruments. In 1957 she became a senior engineer and in 1959 she was appointed head of the radar and communication research laboratory. She became technical director of Elliot Automation Radar Systems, a role in which she was responsible for the technical quality and financial viability of four divisions concerned with the research, development and production of radar and other products. A considerable number of the products Laverick was involved in, such as airborne radar and an army radar went into production. Over time Laverick moved away from technical work towards a managerial role and in 1968 she became the general manager of Elliott Automation Radar Systems, though she had thought that, as a woman, she was barred from such managerial work. From 1967 to 1969 Laverick was president of the Women's Engineering Society, taking over from Rose Winslade. She spent spare time giving career talks to girls and doing much to inspire women to work in the field. She became a member of the WES in 1959, presented the first Verena Holmes lecture by WES in 1969 and edited the WES journal (The Woman Engineer) between 1983 and 1990. In 1984 Laverick accepted nomination as a Vice President of the Electrical Association for Women. Seeking a career change Laverick applied for and became the first female deputy secretary of the Institute of Electrical Engineers in 1971, a role she held for 14 years. Laverick was the fifth woman to be made a Fellow of IEE and was a Fellow of the Institute of Physics. She chaired the Institute of Physics' 'Women in Physics Committee' and was the first woman to serve on the IEE Council. In 1993 she received an OBE for 'services to women in engineering and science'.

Based on the Ô¨Ålmmakers‚Äô real lives, this tale evolves around the lives of the two male protagonists as they strive to fulfill a list of ambitions made when they were 15, with the ultimate goal to make a film before they reach the age of thirty. The film stars Richard Mason and Tom Blyth, both making their debuts as the lead characters in the film, whilst Charlotte Milchard takes on the supporting role as Sid's mum. The film was theatrically released in the UK in March 2018, by Dreamchasers Film Ltd.  Plot  For protagonists Scott (Richard Mason) and Sid (Tom Blyth), one meeting could change their lives. Narrated by a hopeful Scott and Sid, the duo recounts their story to a fascinated taxi driver and the story unfolds in flashbacks. As schoolboys growing up in York, the pair were isolated, underachieving and a little lost. While Scott was an uncontainable and frantic youth, Sid was a more reserved and awkward teen. Both were weighed down by their chaotic lives; Scott, an unloved foster child, was expelled from multiple schools for his unruly behaviour and Sid, the son of an alcoholic mother and absent father, was caught buying alcohol underage and swept up in a dodgy scheme selling alcohol for gangsters. Both are ridiculed by their teacher when they contemplate what the future holds for them and despairing of the compromise and limited ambitions around them, they are united by friendship. In deÔ¨Åance of the low expectations that everyone had for them, Scott and Sid wrote a list of goals and began pursuing each one in turn to create a better life. The overly serious Sid is inspired by Scott's wild and untamed spirit, while Scott draws strength from Sid's boundless work ethic and determination to get ahead. They become ‚ÄòDreamchasers‚Äô, building their whole lifestyle and ideology around pushing themselves farther and faster than anyone expects. Fuelled by ambition and entrepreneurial spirit they launch two successful businesses while still at school. However, lies and deceit soon tarnish the friendship. Overcoming their troubles, they continue to strive to be better and even at the age of 24, it is not enough to have a successful media business, they want more. Item number one on their list of dreams remains: to make a Ô¨Ålm. Chasing their biggest dream yet, they embark on their journey.  Cast  * Richard Mason as Scott, an unloved foster child who has been expelled from multiple schools, rootless and uncontainable. * Tom Blyth as Sid, a withdrawn, awkward son of an alcoholic mother and absent father, who just wants to work hard, get through his exams and escape into his own life. * Charlotte Milchard as Karen, a depressive alcoholic who is mother to protagonist Sid. * David Summer as Mr. Olsen * Maggie Daniels as Mrs. Finn * Andrew Porter as Nicky Watson * Colin Fox as Gavin Watson * Ranj Nagra as Mr. Nanda * Jerry Anderson as cabbie/Mike * Laura Jean Marsh as Jade * Danielle Brown as Tara * Robin Colvill as Detective Russell * Naj Modak as Omar * Juliet Howland as Elaine Production The film was developed and produced by Elsa Media. =Development= From an early age, both Elliott and Sadowskyj knew they wanted to make a film. At the age of 15, they wrote down a list of everything they wanted to achieve in their lives and set about accomplishing them. Fuelled by an entrepreneurial drive, they launched two successful businesses while still at school, beginning with door-to-door oven cleaning. This semi-autobiographical story began with Elliott and Sadowskyj writing down significant moments from their lives, \\"culled directly from their shared experiences in publishing and event management and includes the moment when Scott met with loan sharks.\\" Sadowskyj said that the light bulb moment that changed things for [them] was at 24, when Scott came into the office, said he wanted out of the business and, after an \\"awkward discussion\\", the pair got out a marker and circled \\"Make a Movie\\" and said \\"What's next?\\". From that moment [they] sold up and started to put 100% of [their] efforts into filmmaking.http://www.topman.com/blog/scott-and-sid-interview/ The script began to take shape and went through many drafts. Using elements of fiction to streamline the story or emphasis certain aspects of the characters, they wanted to be honest about the lows as well as the highs of their story together. Elliott's dyslexia meant that he did not learn how to write a professional script from reading books but by watching films, focusing on the structure, character, emotional beats and filmmaking techniques used in the films. Sadowskyj learnt about the practical aspects of filmmaking such as the crew they would need, how they would find investment, any legal issues and any regulations related to filming in cities such as York and Bradford. =Pre- production= Having never made a film before, Elliott and Sadowskyj began months of preparation after the script was formed. Taking advice from people in the industry, they set about finding investors for the film and after a year-long campaign, they were successful. The \\"gruelling\\" process also gave them a key piece of inspiration for the film's structure as the story unfolds in flashbacks as the pair travel in a taxi to an important meeting.loaded.co.uk/how-to-make-a-film-before-you-are-30/ Elliott and Sadowskyj always planned on making the film in the North of England. Wanting to \\"tell a positive story about an area too often dismissed as grim or depressing\\", the pair made use of many locations in Yorkshire. Making \\"the most of Yorkshire's spectacular natural beauty and the Northern English character\\", the duo used their close ties to the community to find buildings to use around York, Leeds, Bradford, and the surrounding areas. Recruiting experienced heads of department, Elliott and Sadowskyj spent time selecting their cast and crew. After a months-long search, Directors of photography Will Humphris was brought on board. Production designer Lauren Hinley made her debut in Scott and Sid, spending months prepping and scouting locations and props to make the most of the film's budget. Up-and-coming composer Ian Arber was introduced to the film and given the time to experiment and muse his ideas for the film's themes and biggest moments. When it came to casting the production, Elliott and Sadowskyj knew that their lead characters, Scott and Sid, had to click. Tom Blyth originally auditioned for the role of Scott. However, after being asked to learn some of Sid's lines, he was cast as the other lead character. The casting process for the character of Scott took a lot longer. Wanting someone \\"to look at the world a bit differently,\\" Elliott travelled to London to meet with Richard Mason, who would soon be cast in the role of Scott. With their newly-cast onscreen counterparts, the real Scott Elliott and Sid Sadowskyj shared accommodation, allowing both Mason and Blyth to observe their mannerisms and the friendship that inspired the film. =Production= Principal photography on the film began in May 2015. Filmed on location in-and-around York, Leeds, and Bradford, Scott and Sid took over seven weeks to shoot. Sadowskyj took on the role of unit manager and location manager while on set, before settling into a more traditional role of producer. Elliott, a very actor-orientated director, worked closely with Blyth and Mason, pushing them into their characters more. =Post-production= Working with editor Andy Morrison to bring the film together and create the director's cut,http://www.andymorrison.co.uk/andy_morrison_%7C_film_editor/andy_morrison_%7C_film_editor_%7C_home.html Andy Morrison Elliott and Sadowskyj focused on creating the finished film. With the use of focus groups and test audiences, they refined and re-cut the film, and when Morrison had to move on to another job, Chris Gill ACE, who previously worked on The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel and 28 Days Later (with British director Danny Boyle), joined the crew.https://www.independenttalent.com/below-the-line/chris-gill/ Chris Gill A.C.E,  Music  The musical score for Scott and Sid was composed by film and television composer Ian Arber. Arber's compositional approach makes use of minimal orchestral instruments with cello-lead melodic phrases and intricate percussive and atmospheric elements throughout his scores.  Themes  The film explores the theme of dreamchasing; having the ambition to chase your dreams, Scott and Sid aims to encourage people to get moving and chase their dreams, with a strong moral to the story that if you believe in yourself, you can do anything. The film, which at one point was going to be called Dreamchaser is a testament to dreaming big but living in the real world when it comes to filmmaking. Based on a true story drawn from the lives of the writer-producer-director team, it is a film about the themes of hope, ambition, and success. Critical response The film received a range of positive reviews from film critics. Alex Clement from HeyUGuys said \\"This film feels more like a sense of achievement rather than your typical blockbuster movie..it brings out the personalities of the real men behind this story and they finally get to tell it to the world. It‚Äôs a powerful statement to people watching, it says you can do whatever you want if you try hard enough. There is no dream too big and anything is possible if you believe in yourself.\\" Ed Edwards of The Upcoming said \\"the drive to spread their wings and prove they are made of something special ‚Äì even just to themselves ‚Äì is conveyed wonderfully and is certainly sufficient on its own, making Scott and Sid a gripping success story that is well worth watching.\\" Katherine Flint-Nicol of BritFlicks said: \\"What is refreshing about the film, also holds the film back. Its desire to be persistently feel-good steers it away from what could have been interesting avenues to go down. However, there is creativity here. The narrative structure is played with, reminiscent of Nick Hamms‚Äô, Martha meet Frank, Daniel and Laurence. The film could have benefitted from a summer release. This upbeat film is made for sunny days.\\" Allan Hunter of the Daily Express rated the film 4 out of 5 stars.  App  The film's app offers users the chance to explore the landscape of the film business with a range of behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with the cast and crew of the film. The app was released in November 2017 for iOS and Android. In the filmmaking app, over 1000 videos are available to watch, with interviews available from the producer, director, composer, DIT, key grip, first assistant director, and both editors with more videos added weekly.  Prints  A limited-edition print collection focused on the film has also been created. Hoping to \\"recapture the wildness of youth,\\" the collection is the \\"brainchild\\" of filmmakers Scott Elliott and Sid Sadowskyj and is inspired by the \\"thoughts, memories and adventures of their own childhood.\\" The images help \\"capture the purity of friendship between the two protagonists and reflect their shared spirit of adventure\\". Created using a unique digital painting technique, each limited-edition Gicl√©e print uses archival fade resistant pigmented colour ink applied to the Hahnem√ºhle German Etching paper, a robust, heavy-duty paper which has warm white hues with traits of a traditional artist board. All prints are signed by the artist, numbered and come with a Certificate of Authenticity.  Novelization  Based on the screenplay of Scott and Sid, and written by Ali Wright, this story of friendship and coming-of-age details how the duo broke free from their dysfunctional lives as they strived to be more than normal. The book details the highs and lows of the pair's true story and allows for readers to learn more about how Elliott and Sadowskyj progressed from their dream to raising the funds to make their first feature film. Scott and Sid: The Novel is available on iBooks and Kindle and available to buy as paperback / hardcover.  Awards and nominations  Scott and Sid won two awards: Best British Film and Best Supporting Actress (for Charlotte Milchard) at the National Film Awards UK 2019 and was nominated for Best Drama but lost to Yardie.

Biography Maria was born in Alimena, in the province of Palermo, the daughter of school inspector Gaetano Messina and Gaetana Valenza Trajna, descendant of a baronial family of Prizzi. She grew up in Messina where she spent an isolated childhood with her parents and brothers. During adolescence, she traveled a lot through the Center and South of Italy because of her father's continual relocations, until in 1911 her family settled in Naples. Maria Messina was self-educated and was consequently encouraged by her older brother to begin the career of a writer. When she was twenty-two she began an intense correspondence with Giovanni Verga. Between 1909 and 1921, she published a series of short stories. Thanks to Verga's support, she also had a novella, Luciuzza, published in 1914 in a literary magazine, Nuova Antologia. Another one, La M√®rica, appeared in 1912 in La Donna . She carried on intense correspondence with various personalities of the time, for example with the Florentine publisher Enrico Bemporad, with the Sicilian poet and critic Alessio Di Giovanni, and especially the Catanese writer Giovanni Verga. Altogether, Maria Messina produced various collections of novellas, five novels, and a selection of children's literature, which gave her notable prestige. Of a certain worth were her various contributions in magazines, and her article included in a 1929 anthology, Studi verghiani, edited by Lina Perroni. In 1928 her last novel L'amore negato came out, while the multiple sclerosis that she had been diagnosed with at the age of twenty was developing complications. She died of this disease in Pistoia in 1944. She lived for many years in Mistretta, a small town in the province of Messina, in the heart of the Nebrodi Mountains, where many of her stories are set. Her mortal remains, along with those of her mother, were transferred on April 24, 2009 to Mistretta, considered her second hometown. Maria Messina was made an \\"honorary citizen\\" of the ancient \\"capital\\" of the Nebrodi. Her niece Annie Messina (1910‚Äì1996), daughter of Maria's brother Salvatore, was a writer too. Writing Messina's writing concentrates above all on Sicilian culture and, as principal themes, the isolation and oppression of young Sicilian women.. Moreover, her writing is focused on the domination and submission inherent in the emotional relationships between men and women. What is more, one of her best-known novels, La casa nel vicolo, marked a turning point in Messina's writing, toward the use of psychological conditions. In her narration Messina depicted the oppression of women as inevitable and cyclic and, because of this, some think that she was not a feminist. Nevertheless, the women she depicted were the representation of powerful declarations of an attitude of challenge.. Reception Maria Messina is among the important women writers in the history of Italian literature of the early 20th century. So she is counted in the research project The Women Authors of Italian Literature. After her premature death, Maria Messina's name slowly and gradually started to become forgotten and her books started going out of print. Only in 1980 she was rediscovered by Leonardo Sciascia,Messina, Maria. La M√®rica and Nonna Lidda, edited by Leonardo Sciascia. In Cresci, Paolo; Guidobaldi, Luciano (eds.) (1980). Partono i bastimenti, Testi di Carlo Cassola, Luciano De Crescenzo, Maria Messina, Domenico Porzio, Leonardo Sciascia, Carlo Sgorlon, Saverio Strati (in Italian).

She was appointed the Fourth Secretary on the Parliament's Board in 2015 and also remains in that role as of 2017. Catalan independence crisis Barrufet receiving the vote of left In June 2017 President of Catalonia Carles Puigdemont announced that a referendum on Catalan independence would be held on 1 October 2017. The Catalan Parliament passed legislation on 6 September 2017 authorising the referendum which would be binding and based on a simple majority without a minimum threshold. The following day Constitutional Court of Spain suspended the legislation, blocking the referendum. The Spanish government put into effect Operation Anubis in order to disrupt the organisation of the referendum and arrested Catalan government officials. Despite this the referendum went ahead though it was boycotted by unionists and turnout was only 43%. 92% of those who voted supported independence. Around 900 people were injured as the Spanish police used violence to try to prevent voting in the referendum. On 27 October 2017 the Catalan Parliament declared independence in a vote boycotted by opposition MPs. Almost immediately the Senate of Spain invoked article 155 of the constitution, dismissing Puigdemont and the Catalan government and imposing direct rule on Catalonia. The following day Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy dissolved the Catalan Parliament and called for fresh regional elections on 21 December 2017. On 30 October 2017 Spanish Attorney General Jos√© Manuel Maza laid charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds at the Supreme Court against Corominas and five other members of the Board of the Parliament of Catalonia (Ramona Barrufet, Carme Forcadell, Llu√≠s Guin√≥, Joan Josep Nuet and Anna Sim√≥). Corominas was charged despite not being a member of the board at the time of the declaration of independence. The charges carried maximum sentences of 30, 15 and 6 years in prison respectively. Corominas and the other members of the board appeared before Supreme Court judge Pablo Llarena on 9 November 2017. Nuet was released without any precautionary measures but the other five had to pay bail (‚Ç¨100,000 for Forcadell, ‚Ç¨25,000 each for Barrufet, Corominas, Guin√≥ and Sim√≥), surrender their passport and present themselves at a court weekly. The bail bonds were paid by the Catalan National Assembly. After a four-month judicial investigation into the referendum and declaration of independence Supreme Court judge Pablo Llarena issued a 70-page ruling on 23 March 2018 in which he ordered that 25 of the 28 Catalan politicians and activists under investigation be tried for rebellion, embezzlement or disobedience. Corominas was charged with disobeying an order of the Constitutional Court (article 410 of the criminal code). A pre-trial hearing commenced on 18 December 2018 at the Supreme Court at which defence lawyers argued that the court was not competent to hear charges of rebellion or disobedience and that it should be heard at the High Court of Justice of Catalonia. On 27 December 2018 the Supreme Court ruled that, although they were competent to hear all the charges, the six defendants charged only with disobedience (Barrufet, Mireia Boya, Corominas, Guin√≥, Nuet and Sim√≥) would be tried at the High Court of Justice of Catalonia.

The painting depicts the Batavia Castle, the headquarter of the Dutch East India Company located in what is now Kota Tua in Jakarta, Indonesia. The painting is currently displayed in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. Presentation Map of Batavia in 1669 showing the location of the fish market (number 18) which is much closer than the one painted by Beeckman. The painting features the Castle of Batavia, an early 17th-century fortress of the Dutch East India Company located in the city of Batavia (present Jakarta). The painter shows the fort as seen from the street of Kali Besar Barat (Grote Rivier West) with the Kali Besar on the right and the covered fish market on the far left. The painter created a vibrant setting by having a kind of street market placed below four rows of coconut palm trees. On the market, people of different ethnicity are shown. These people represent the multi-ethnic inhabitants of Batavia. Among the different ethnic groups represented in the painting are The Chinese, the Malays, the Moluccans, the Dutch and the mestizos. There are also depictions of foreigners such as a Japanese and a Timorese. Men in striped clothing are the Mardijkers, released freed slaves from the conquered Portuguese territory. A Dutchman walks with his Asian wife in the middle, under a parasol. Several Maluku people are seen playing the takraw rattan ball game. At the very top of the palm trees, there are a few boys are picking coconuts, and throw them down to be collected by a group of Javanese at the bottom. A kind of bridge-like structure is formed between the coconut trees, to access each trees easily from the top. Batavia Castle looms in the background, while a group of Dutchmen on horses are seen just leaving the castle. Beeckman has allowed himself some freedom in depicting the buildings of the city of Batavia. For example, the fish market is actually located much closer to the Castle than the one depicted by Beeckman in the painting. Nevertheless, his presentation of the market to the left of Kali Besar is reasonable, as there are buildings accurately located on the west side of the river. History Anonymous. De markt van Batavia. Na 1688. Amsterdam, Tropenmuseum In 1657, Beeckman was stationed in Batavia as a VOC soldier. In 1658, Beeckman returned to Amsterdam and using his sketches which he created in Batavia as a reference, he created Het Kasteel van Batavia in the Netherlands. Beeckman created the work following a commission by the Amsterdam Chamber of the VOC who wanted a painting to decorate the meeting room of the East Indies House in Amsterdam. He probably created the painting between 1662-1663. In 1688, John George III, Elector of Saxony received permission from the Amsterdam Chamber to copy the paintings from the meeting room of the East Indies House, including Beeckman's Het Kasteel van Batavia. The painting De markt van Batavia which is currently kept in the Tropenmuseum is the result of the copy. This painting is signed J.F.F. and has an inscription on a boat 'De marckt van Batavia'. Although the painting of De markt van Batavia is traditionally attributed to Beeckman, it does not correspond stylistically to his work and there is no reason to doubt the authenticity of this signature. The painting De markt van Batavia is therefore not an exact copy of Beeckman's Het Kasteel van Batavia, but a work that is based on both Beeckman's original in the Rijksmuseum and Beeckman's costumes series, a series of painting depicting the costume of the inhabitants of Batavia. Attribution and dating Het kasteel van Batavia is signed at the bottom right 'ABeeckman Fecit' and was probably painted in 1662-1663. In April 1662 Beeckman was commissioned by the Chamber of Amsterdam of the VOC to create two paintings, which he delivered in 1663. Beeckman received 240 guilders for this. Het Kasteel van Batavia is probably one of these works. The painting hung above the chimney of the meeting room in the East Indies House in Amsterdam until 1859. In 1859, the Rijksmuseum purchased the drawing from the Eats Indies House and was transferred to the museum.Unknown (1903) Catalogus der Schilderijen miniaturen, pastels, omlijste teekeningen, enz. in het Rijks-Museum te Amsterdam, Amsterdam: Boek- en kunstdrukkerij v/h Roeloffzen-H√ºbner en Van Santen, p. 42, cat.nr. 445 (als Gezicht op Jacatra).

The bride's veil was embroidered with flowers representing the countries of the Commonwealth, the California poppy, in honour of Meghan Markle's home state of California, and wintersweet, a flower that grows at Kensington Palace.  Pre-wedding speculation  The engagement of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry was announced on 27 November 2017, but the speculation about the bride's dress had started even earlier. Some commentators suggested that Markle would not wear a white wedding dress as she had been married previously. In December 2017, Israeli designer Inbal Dror was asked to submit designs for a wedding dress. It was rumoured that Erdem and Ralph & Russo were also contenders. By January 2018, British designer Stewart Parvin was the bookmakers' favourite. Betting was suspended after Alexander McQueen attracted a large amount of wagers. Markle had commented on wedding dress styles in 2016, as her character was getting married in Suits, saying that she preferred simple styles. Meghan Markle, long a vocal admirer of the style of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, described Kennedy's wedding gown as \\"everything goals\\". It was also reported that Markle herself would pay for the bridal gown, but she did not.  Designer  Markle chose designer Waight Keller because she \\"wanted to highlight the success of a leading British talent who has now served as the creative head of three globally influential fashion houses ‚Äî Pringle of Scotland, Chlo√©, and now Givenchy.\\" She chose Keller to create her wedding dress due to the designer's \\"elegant aesthetic\\" and \\"relaxed demeanour.\\" Waight Keller has been Givenchy's creative director since 2017. The dress was made in Paris by \\"a small team of ateliers\\". There was only five months to have the dress and the veil manufactured, and Waight Keller and Markle met for eight fittings. Markle and Waight Keller worked closely together to design the dress, which shows a \\"timeless minimal elegance\\", according to a Kensington Palace announcement. The two contacted each other through discreet texts and phone calls, before and after nondisclosure agreements were signed, with Waight Keller unable to tell anyone that she had been selected to design the dress. Waight Keller stated that the dress sought to \\"convey modernity through sleek lines and sharp cuts\\", while paying homage to the history of the Givenchy house.  Dress details  The design of the simple white dress and the name of its maker were revealed only when the bride got out of the car and entered St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle for the wedding service. The dress was made of silk with three-quarter-length sleeves, an open boat neckline and a train with built-in triple silk organza underskirt. Waight Keller helped develop a double bonded silk cady for the construction of the dress, which featured only six seams. The dress was without lace or any other embellishments. A piece of the blue dress from Markle‚Äôs first date with Prince Harry was stitched into the bridal gown.  Dress display  = Veil = The dress is augmented by a long 5 metre (16-ft) veil, hand-embroidered with a variety of flowers on its hem, and symbolic sprays of wheat. It was 3 metres wide. The veil took longer to create than the dress itself, and the embroiderers spent 500 hours on completing it, washing their hands every 30 minutes to make sure that the veil would remain immaculate until the wedding day. Markle chose two favourite flowers ‚Äì wintersweet (Chimonanthus praecox), which grows outside Nottingham Cottage at Kensington Palace, where she and Harry lived, and the California poppy (Eschscholzia californica), from where she was born ‚Äì along with individual flowers representing the 53 countries of the Commonwealth, reflecting the couple's interest in the work of the Commonwealth. The countries and flowers are: Acacia pycnantha (Australia) Nymphaea nouchali (Bangladesh) Guaiacum officinale (Jamaica) Markhamia zanzibarica (Mozambique) Vanda 'Miss Joaquim' (Singapore) Warszewiczia coccinea (Trinidad & Tobago) * Antigua and Barbuda ‚Äì agave (Agave karatto) * Australia ‚Äì golden wattles (Acacia pycnantha) * Bahamas ‚Äì yellow elder (Tecoma stans) * Bangladesh ‚Äì or white water lily (white form of Nymphaea nouchali) * Barbados ‚Äì the pride of Barbados (Caesalpinia pulcherrima) * Belize ‚Äì the black orchid (Prosthechea cochleata) * Botswana ‚Äì ear of Sorghum and cat's claw (Uncaria tomentosa) * Brunei Darussalam ‚Äì simpor (Dillenia suffruticosa) * Cameroon ‚Äì red stinkwood (Prunus africana) * Canada ‚Äì bunchberry (Cornus canadensis) * Cyprus ‚Äì Cyclamen cyprium * Dominica ‚Äì carib wood (Poitea carinalis) * Fiji ‚Äì tagimaucia (Medinilla waterhousei) * Gambia ‚Äì white variety orchid * Ghana ‚Äì caladium (Caladium) * Grenada ‚Äì bougainvillea (Nyctaginaceae) * Guyana ‚Äì Queen Victoria water lily (Victoria amazonica) * India ‚Äì Indian lotus (Nelumbo nucifera) * Jamaica ‚Äì lignum vitae (Guaiacum officinale) * Kenya ‚Äì the tropical orchid * Kiribati ‚Äì Bidens kiribatiensis * Lesotho ‚Äì spiral aloe (Aloe polyphylla) * Malawi ‚Äì lotus (Nymphaea lotus) * Malaysia ‚Äì bunga raya or tropical hibiscus (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis) * Malta ‚Äì Maltese centaury (Cheirolophus crassifolius) * Mauritius ‚Äì Trochetia boutoniana * Mozambique ‚Äì maroon bell bean (Markhamia zanzibarica) * Namibia ‚Äì welwitschia (Welwitschia mirabilis) * Nauru ‚Äì Calophyllum * New Zealand ‚Äì kowhai (Sophora microphylla) * Nigeria ‚Äì yellow trumpet (Costus spectabilis) * Pakistan ‚Äì jasmine (Jasminum officinale) * Papua New Guinea ‚Äì Sepik blue orchid (Dendrobium lasianthera) * Rwanda ‚Äì torch lily (Kniphofia uvaria) * Saint Lucia ‚Äì the rose and the marguerite * Samoa ‚Äì teuila (Alpinia purpurata) * Seychelles ‚Äì tropicbird orchid (Angraecum eburneum) * Sierra Leone ‚Äì scadoxus (Scadoxus cinnabarinus) * Singapore ‚Äì Vanda 'Miss Joaquim' * Solomon Islands ‚Äì hibiscus (Hibiscus) * South Africa ‚Äì protea (Protea cynaroides) * Sri Lanka ‚Äì blue water lily (pale blue form of Nymphaea nouchali) * St Kitts and Nevis ‚Äì poinciana (Delonix regia) * St Vincent & the Grenadines ‚Äì Soufriere tree (Spachea perforata) * Swaziland ‚Äì fire heath (Erica cerinthoides) * Tonga ‚Äì heilala (Garcinia sessilis) * Trinidad & Tobago ‚Äì chaconia (Warszewiczia coccinea) * Tuvalu ‚Äì plumeria (Plumeria rubra) * Uganda ‚Äì desert rose (Adenium obesum) * United Kingdom  England ‚Äì rose (Rosa)  Northern Ireland ‚Äì flax (Linum usitatissimum)  Scotland ‚Äì thistle (Cirsium vulgare)  Wales ‚Äì daffodil (Narcissus) * United Republic of Tanzania ‚Äì African violet (Streptocarpus sect.

Thank you. She is absolutely magnificent.\\" Queen Elizabeth was reportedly surprised by the colour of the dress, since Markle was married before, and traditionally white wedding dress were worn by first-time brides only. Australian media have noted similarities between the dress and that worn by Mary Donaldson at her wedding to Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark. It has also been compared to a Givenchy dress worn by Audrey Hepburn in the film Funny Face. Emilia Wickstead claimed that the dress was \\"identical\\" to one of her designs. Unfavorable comparisons of Meghan's wedding dress in comparison to Catherine Middleton's wedding dress were proclaimed online and in the press, with Catherine's wedding dress being proclaimed as the \\"victor\\", as if there was an unspoken competition. On the more positive but admittedly unironic and snarky end of the spectrum, critics also noted that Markle's dress seemed an attempt to mimic the late fashionista Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy. Meghan Markle's wedding dress was compared to a formal dress Bessette-Kennedy once wore during her life, and her reception dress had similarities to Bessette-Kennedy's now-classic 1990s-era slip dress, although Meghan Markle's reception dress was a 1990s-style halter dress. Markle's wedding dress received mixed reviews from the public, some saying it was \\"beautiful\\" and \\"stunning\\" while others described it as \\"boring\\", \\"baggy\\", and \\"ill fitting.\\" Celebrity commentators, fashion editors, internet influencers, and Twitter commenters criticized the dress, calling it \\"boring\\", \\"ill- fitting\\", and \\"too big\\", criticizing the cut, the shape, and even the matte satin fabric, calling the finish \\"dull\\", criticizing a perceived lack of tailoring on the sleeves and waist, and others declaring the overall effect as \\"heavy\\". Fashion experts noted that the silk cady fabric would have been difficult to move in if the dress had been more form-fitting. Critics mocked the veil style and length, going so far as to create an Internet meme comparing it to a CVS receipt. Robin Givhan of The Washington Post noted in her review of the gown that \\"It was not a Hollywood red-carpet statement...it was not a Disney-princess fantasy...the dress was a backdrop; it was in service to the woman.\\" Desiree Cooper of the Detroit Free Press unfavorably compared the dress to a costume \\"straight from The Handmaid's Tale\\", but conceded, \\"She could have been wearing a paper bag (which she nearly was) and it wouldn't have mattered an iota. That girl was just plain stunning.\\" Less than a week after the wedding, dresses based on Markle's were being sold. The dress, veil and tiara were exhibited by the Royal Collection Trust at Windsor Castle from October 2018 until February 2019, and then at Holyrood Palace from June 2019 to October 2019.
