It opened in Station Street in 1909, showing its first silent film on 27 December of that year, and is now the oldest working cinema in the country. It predates its namesake, the Electric Cinema in Notting Hill, London, by around two months. Originally called the Electric Theatre, the cinema has undergone a number of name changes since its opening, but returned as the Electric in October 1993. History =1900s= The Electric opened on the bank holiday of 27 December 1909 and was Birmingham‚Äôs first film theatre. The architectural plans were designed by leading theatre architect of the time, Bertie Crewe (1860-1937) which are now a part of the Library of Birmingham's archives and collections. Excerpts from newspapers at the time: \\"There has been a further addition to the number of places of amusement in Birmingham. Electric Theatre (1908), Ltd., of London has taken a commodious shop in Station-Street, right in the centre of the city, and the interior has been transformed into a cosy and attractive entertainment hall with a capacity of 376, in red plush tip-up seats. The machines here are also of the latest Edison type, and brilliantly steady pictures are shown at a throw of about 55 ft. The operating room is similarly equipped, and is one of the finest in the city. The pictures displayed, some of which are in colours, are of an historical, dramatic, educational, as well as of a humorous character, and the entertainment is proving a decided attraction with young and old alike. Pictures showing this week are To Save Her Soul, Piedmont, The Shell, A Box of Chocolates, The Cabbage, Making Plate Glass, A Workman‚Äôs Revenge, and That Skating Carnival, with a complete change on Thursday. Mr. George Putnam, is the energetic manager, and Mr. A. Hart chief man at the wheel. It is estimated that upwards of two thousand persons paid for admission on the opening day, and from two o‚Äôclock until eleven there is a constant stream of fresh arrivals. Mr Putnam is arranging for a constant change of programme, and all the latest and most interesting pictures will be displayed from time to time.\\" Sources: The Era, Film Gossip and Notices, 22 January 1910, Kinematograph & Lantern Weekly, 7 July 1910, and The Rinking World & Picture Theatre News, 8 January 1910. =1920s and 1930s= In the 1920s, the cinema was bought out and underwent the first of many name changes, becoming known as The Select showing a programme of silent movies. In 1931 Joseph Cohen, a highly successful Birmingham entrepreneur, bought The Select and for a few months screened rep films, before closing the cinema in 1932 with a view to a complete refit. His plan was to obtain the uppers floors, then create a balcony and changing rooms for the staff. Architect Cecil E.M.Filmore was hired to help navigate these structural alternations and on 20 March 1937 the film theatre reopened as The Tatler News Theatre. This was the city's second news theatre where rolling news reels from Pathe and British Movietone, along with short films and cartoons were presented. =1950s and 1960s= After World War II, with television becoming increasingly popular, attendance at news theatres declined. In the 1950s, the cinema changed its focus and became The Jacey Cartoon Theatre (Jacey derived from Joseph Cohen's initials). This did not last for long and in the 1960s, it became the Jacey Film Theatre, mainly showing a programme of art house and continental pictures. =1970s= For much of the 1970s, the cinema was a shadow of its former-self, largely showing soft pornographic films. The early 1980s saw a revival, with the cinema taken over by Lord Grade's \\"Classic\\" chain and split into two screens. This incarnation did not last for long and in the mid-1980s it became the Tivoli, screening a mix of mainstream. arthouse and exploitation films. In 1993 it was bought by Bill Heine and managed by Steven Metcalf.http://www.perrybs.bham.sch.uk/documents/school%20report/That%20Electric%20Feeling.pdf They also reverted it to being called the Electric. A contemporary work of art called Thatcher's Children by artist John Buckley was installed in the windows on the front of the building, with the intent to shock and attract publicity to the opening of an art cinema in Birmingham.http://www.theelectric.co.uk/page.php?page=15 =2000s= The Electric closed, however, on 12 December 2003. =Renovation and reopening= The cinema was put up for sale and was quickly purchased by a local entrepreneur, Tom Lawes. After a ¬£250,000 refit and renovation, the cinema reopened on 17 December 2004. The building was restored to its original 1930s Art Deco look from photographs taken during that period. In recognition of its centenary in December 2009, local MPs Tom Watson, Khalid Mahmood and Richard Burden raised a motion in the House of Commons stating that the House: Two doors to the east of the cinema is Britain's oldest repertory theatre the Old Rep theatre.https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=52.4766&mlon;=-1.8987&zoom;=16#map=19/52.47660/-1.89870 References External links * Cinemas in the West Midlands (county) Culture in Birmingham, West Midlands Buildings and structures in Birmingham, West Midlands ","title":"The Electric, Birmingham"},{"id":"1362739","text":"Bartlett Yancey, Jr. (February 19, 1785 ‚Äì August 30, 1828) was a Democratic- Republican U.S. Congressman from North Carolina, United States, between 1813 and 1817. Born near Yanceyville, North Carolina, Yancey attended Hyco Academy in Caswell County before enrolling at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 1804 to 1806. He was admitted to the bar in 1807 and practiced law. Yancey was elected to the 13th United States Congress in 1812 and re-elected in 1814 to the 14th Congress, serving from March 4, 1813 to March 3, 1817. During both terms, he chaired the Committee on Claims. Refusing to run for Congress again in 1816, Yancey instead ran for the North Carolina Senate and served there for ten years, from 1817 to 1827; he served as Speaker of the North Carolina Senate for his entire tenure in the legislature. He died near Yanceyville in 1828 and is buried in his family cemetery. Yancey County, North Carolina, and Bartlett Yancey High School (in Yanceyville, Caswell County, North Carolina) are named in his honor. Some believe that the town of Yanceyville, North Carolina, also was named for him. However, this issue is contested, with many attributing the Yanceyville name to James Yancey, the brother of Bartlett Yancey, Jr. For an interesting discussion on this issue see When the Past Refused to Die: A History of Caswell County North Carolina 1777-1977, by William S.

The population in 2011 was 3,744,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of .Eurostat It is the second most populous parish in the municipality of Praia da Vit√≥ria. It contains the localities Fund√µes, Caldeira, Canada da Caldeira, Canada das Fontainhas, Canada das Vinhas, Canada do Po√ßo, Lajedo, Lajes, Pic√£o, Rebent√£o and Santa Rita. Lajes is best known for being the location of Portuguese Air Force Base No.4, used for military, small inter-island, as well as scheduled and chartered flights from North America and mainland Europe. The U.S. military has a multi-year agreement with the government of Portugal at Lajes Airfield, which is the base for U.S. 65th Air Base Wing (65 ABW). History Although the date of Lajes elevation to status of ecclesiastical or civil parish is unknown, there is reference to the navigator Pero de Barcelos, who was one of the first settlers in the region, dating to 3 April 1507. Even the date of the construction of the primitive temple are unknown, and rather the date of its destruction during the 1641 Ca√≠da da Praia earthquake is the only reference made to the religious structure. At the time three of the captaincies of Praia were destroyed, along with many of the buildings in the town of Praia, and parishes of Fontinhas, Lajes, Vila Nova and Agualva. Owing to the natural qualities, Lajes was always the preferred residency of the rich and noble families, resulting in it being referred to as A Madrid dos A√ßores (The Madrid of the Azores). Many of the estates and lands supported the island of Terceira, and was usually referred as the Celeiro da Terceira (the breadbasket of Terceira). There are also registered several references to the quantity and quality of the produce in the region, including fruit and wine, in addition to silk production. Lajes is located on a vast fertile plain, divided by hedge rows and where many old signeurial homes still reflect the importance of farming and prosperity of the traditional families of the island. Today, many of the modern roadways that intersect the parish, were once used by farmers to transport goods, usually using the large Ramo Grande oxen, pulling large carts, crafted to transport large, weighty loads, without putting undue stress on the animals. Wood would normally be transported, burned to maintain the warmth during the winter, or for cooking bread in earthen ovens. The oxen, the signeurial homes and agricultural community became known as the Ramo Grande. Along with Santa Cruz, Lajes also became the focus, during the Second and Post-Second World War of British and American forces stationed at Area Base No. 4, supporting progress and providing a dynamic economic innovator for the parish and region. Geography A portion of the north-eastern coastline of Lajes, showing rural nature and rugged rock cliffs Lajes is situated on the northern coast of Terceira, bordered on the west by the parishes of Vila Nova and S√£o Br√°s, to the east by Santa Cruz and south, by the parish of Fontinhas. The majority (over half) of the parish is occupied by Air Base No. 4, and the barracks/homes of Air Force personnel stationed on the base (including American and Portuguese servicemen). The remainder of the base is actually in the neighbouring civil parish of Santa Cruz. The western frontier is delineated by the Ribeira da Areia that crosses into the interior, reaching the parishes of Vila Nova and S√£o Br√°s. The border then skirts Lorais, until Fund√µes, and parts towards the interior again, intersecting at Rua do Terreiro, Rua das Covas, Rua dos Fund√µes and Rua Padre Greg√≥rio B. Rocha, before arriving in Pic√£o. The border then passes through the pasturelands of the interior, before aligning with the regional roadway at Santa Luzia, and running perpendicular towards the regional airport, bisecting the runway in the direction of Santa Rita, until the coast at Ponta dos Carneiros. In addition to Ribeira da Areia and Ribeira dos P√£es, the parish is crossed by subterranean branches of the Ribeira do Marques (that crosses the airport/air base). Climate Economy Owing to the significance and importance of the regional air field, the economy of Lajes has a symbiotic relationship with the activities at Air Base No.4. Most of the auxiliary staff at the base are residents of Lajes, and many services in the parish support the international demands of the stationed personal. Although most services are provided on base for servicemen, there are still trickle-down affects to the local community, with support personnel living in the parish and spending their money in the local economy. At the same time, it is common for foreign servicemen to support the local economy, when not on duty. Local activities include carpentry shops, services directed to farmers, automobile and mechanical garages, video, graphic and promotional services and financial institutions, including branches of the national and regional banks (Montepio, Banif, etc.). In addition, several shops, mini-markets, fruit stands and groceries service the local residents with bakeries, a butcher shop, and hairstylists. Architecture Lajes has several elementary schools with the main one located in Aldeia Nova. It has two churches with the main one dating back to the 16th century. This church has been destroyed by earthquakes in 1614 and 1841 and partially destroyed in the 1 January 1980 earthquake. The other smaller church is located in Cabouco. =Civic= * Fountain of Ribeira da Areia () * Fountain of Mal√≠cias () * Fountain of Largo de S.

He served as a New Democratic member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1969 to 1981. Jenkins was raised in the Souris region. He served with the Royal Winnipeg Rifles and saw combat with the Canadian Scottish Regiment in World War II, and was wounded in action after the D-Day invasion in the city of Caen, France. He married Elizabeth Ineson of Lancaster, Lancashire England and they subsequently had three children, Linda, Ross and Terry after returning home to Canada where he was educated at the University of Manitoba, and later worked as a journeyman carpenter and car repair estimator for the C.P.R. He was a member of the Winnipeg School Board No.1 from 1962 to 1970, and was also involved in Jubilee Lodge #6 of the Carmen's Union and the Weston Shops ex- Servicemen's Association; the Royal Canadian Legion and the Red River Co- operative movement. He was active in the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation and the New Democratic Party, and often spoke of J.S. Woodsworth and Tommy Douglas as his ideological mentors. He was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1969, scoring an easy victory in the Winnipeg riding of Logan. He was re-elected in the 1973 election and the 1977 election. He did not serve in the cabinet of Edward Schreyer, but was Deputy Speaker on two occasions and served as party Whip in opposition. In the legislature, he often defended the social rights of workers and the unemployed. In 1981, he was appointed to the Manitoba Rent Review Board and retired from politics.

Men may also wear a popular variant where all parts (morning coat, waistcoat and trousers) are the same colour and material, often grey and usually called \\"morning suit\\" or \\"morning grey\\" to distinguish it; considered properly appropriate only to festive functions such as summer weddings and horse races, which consequently makes it slightly less formal. The correct hat would be a formal top hat, or if on less spacious audience settings optionally a collapsible equivalent opera hat. Debrett's states that morning dress should not be specified as the dress code for events starting after 6 p.m. If a formal event will commence at or after 6 p.m., white tie should be specified instead. The semi-formal daytime counterpart of this code is the black lounge suit. Morning dress is generally restricted to certain weddings, royal, governmental or municipal audiences, and social season events, e.g., horse races. It may also be seen sometimes worn at church services, as well as fraternal orders, and gentlemen's clubs. History Giuseppe Verdi (1813‚Äì1901) in 1844 Caricature of Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon in Vanity Fair, 11 September 1869 Morning dress fashion (middle), as opposed to frock coats (left and right) (1848) The name originated from the practice of gentlemen in the nineteenth century riding a horse in the morning with a cutaway front, single breasted morning coat. The modern twentieth century morning dress was originally a more casual form of half dress, but as the nineteenth century progressed it gradually became acceptable to wear it in more formal situations instead of a frock coat. In the Edwardian era it took over in popularity from the frock coat as the standard daytime form of men's full dress. When it was regarded as a more casual coat, it was common to see it made with step collars (notched lapels in American English), but as it took over from the frock coat in formality it began to be made with the more formal pointed lapels (peaked lapels in American English). Composition Winston Churchill in morning dress, lifting his top hat with his walking stick (1943). Morning dress consists of: *a morning coat (the morning cut of tailcoat), now always single breasted with link closure (as on some dinner jackets) or one button (or very rarely two) and with pointed lapels, may include silk piping on the edges of the coat and lapels (and cuffs on older models with turnup coat sleeves). *a waistcoat, which matches the material of the coat. *a pair of formal striped or checked trousers worn with braces. *a shirt; **either a turndown collar is worn (white detachable, fastened by collar studs; or attached) with a tie, in which case the shirt has double cuffs. **otherwise, a high detachable wing collar is worn with a single-cuffed shirt; this combination is always accompanied now by a formal Ascot, as opposed to a day cravat which is different. This is a more formal option most commonly seen at weddings; *a plain or patterned silk handkerchief or pocket square may be worn; it is folded and inserted into the front breast pocket of the morning coat. *black Oxford shoes or dress boots, or boots with a horse riding connection, such as George or Chelsea boot, or galosh-top dress boots; worn with plain dark socks (or another colour if they cannot be seen). If the trouser cloth matches the coat, the ensemble becomes a morning suit. The waistcoat may also match, or not (an \\"odd waistcoat\\"). Morning suits will sometimes be a middle-tone grey. Morning suits, especially the lighter-toned ones, are considered slightly less formal than morning coat ensembles. The following can optionally be worn or carried with morning dress: * a top hat, either classic silk plush, or a modern Melusine fur (replacement for silk plush, as it is no longer in mainstream manufacture). Alternatively, a top hat made of fur felt or wool felt, is another common option. * gloves of suede, chamois, or kid leather; the most traditional colour is lemon or grey * grey or white spats * a cane or umbrella * a pocket watch on the waistcoat rather than at the lapel, or wrist watch * a boutonni√®re Considered slightly less formal by some, a morning suit can be worn in variant sometimes referred to as \\"morning grey dress\\", which has mid-grey matching morning coat, waistcoat, and trousers (all cut the same as above); being more relaxed, this is a traditional option for events in less formal settings such as Royal Ascot, and is now often worn to weddings as well. = Morning coat = The modern morning coat is single-breasted and usually has peaked lapels. It is usually closed with a single button but may have a link-front closure instead. It is traditionally in either black or Oxford grey herringbone wool, which should not be too heavy a weight, with curved front edges sloping back into tails of knee length. The coat may feature ribbon braiding around the edges of the collar, lapels, and down around the tails; it may also be present on the hook vent, breast pocket, and sleeves. Nicholas Storey advises that braiding should be avoided for very formal morning wear. = Waistcoat = A black morning coat with matching black waistcoat is the most formal option, being worn for Court, funerals, memorial services, civic dress and diplomatic dress (replacing or supplementing Court Dress), with academic dress, or in government use in America. At social or festive occasions, e.g. horse races and weddings, a contrasting waistcoat is worn. The most traditional colours are dove grey, light grey (including pearl grey), buff or camel (both yellowish tan colours), duck-egg blue, and occasionally white. There has been a tendency towards 'fancy' waistcoats of multicoloured and embroidered materials such as brocade, especially at weddings, although brightly coloured waistcoats may be considered garish. Other colours sold by traditional English tailors include pastels such as powder blue, pale pink, pale green, and other pastels. Generally, traditional waistcoats are made from linen, silk, or wool. Waistcoats may be either single-breasted with, or without, lapels or double- breasted with lapels. Single-breasted models with lapels usually feature a step collar and are worn with the bottom button undone, whilst double-breasted models commonly have either a shawl collar or a peak lapel and are worn fully buttoned. In either case, Debrett's advise against wearing backless waistcoats because they do not look as smart as real ones. Sometimes a white slip is worn, which is a strip of fabric buttoned to the inside top of the waistcoat to simulate the effect of a paler under-waistcoat, though the actual wearing of two waistcoats was obsolete even for the late Victorians. = Trousers = Hamide Ay≈üe Sultan (1887‚Äì1960) with her husband in morning coat and formal trousers The formal ('spongebag') trousers worn with it are either 'cashmere' striped, or black and white checked. Formal trousers should not have turn-ups (cuffs in American English), and have either flat-fronts or one to two forward pleats to each leg. Braces (suspenders in American English) may be worn to prevent the waistband from appearing beneath the waistcoat if required. Belts should not be worn with morning dress. Less common (and less formal) alternatives to striped trousers are houndstooth check, Prince of Wales check, and grey flannel trousers, amongst others. = Shirt = Since the Second World War, in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth Realms, the traditional shirt for morning dress has been a white or light-coloured shirt with double cuffs (fastened with cufflinks) and a plain white stiff turn-down collar (often of the cutaway variety) worn with a long tie. A detachable collar is no longer considered to be necessary and is very formal by modern standards. Alternatively, a wing collar may be worn; the combination of long tie and wing collar is very dated, so these are instead paired with an ascot. Unfortunately, this combination has acquired negative connotations because most dress hire companies have used pre-tied or incorrect patterns for many years, which has caused the configuration to be seen as an inferior or hired look. Consequently, Debrett's (and the late Hardy Amies) consider the wing collar and ascot to be inappropriate for weddings or morning dress, reserving wing collars for white tie. If a wing collar is worn, the collar should be of the starched, detachable, variety and also include starched single cuffs (secured with cufflinks) all in white. This is because, in the past, a starched stiff-fronted shirt was worn with starched cuffs and a starched detachable wing collar, worn with cufflinks and shirt studs; it is essentially the same as a plain-fronted (rather than Marcella) full evening dress shirt. Contemporary shirts often do not have a detachable collar at all which, provided they have the same height and stiffness as the detachable type, are considered to be an acceptable alternative. The most formal colour for a shirt is white but, if a coloured or striped shirt is worn, it should have a contrasting white collar (and possibly cuffs). Traditional formal shirtings are usually light-coloured and may include cream, blue (such as Wedgwood blue), pink, lavender, peach, salmon, yellow, or pastel green. Morning dress shirts (other than the collar) are usually solid in colour or have thin vertical stripes but may have a slightly bolder pattern such as a houndstooth or glencheck. = Neck wear = Previously, a grey or (if at a funeral) a black necktie was obligatory. Now all colours are worn; in many clubs and societies the club tie is acceptable to distinguish members from guests at formal lunches and breakfasts. The original silver Macclesfield design (a small check) is still used particularly with cravats, and is often called a wedding tie. Wearing a silver-grey silk tie is the usual practice at royal and other formal events. Although there is no longer a strict rule governing the colour and pattern of ties that are worn to weddings these days, garish options are inadvisable. The English etiquette authority, Debrett's, dictate that smart woven silk ties are preferred to cravats although stocks and cravats may be worn as an alternative. The American etiquette authority, The Emily Post Institute, states that either a tie or a dress ascot may be worn with a morning coat. If worn, cravats may be tied in either a formal dress knot (Ascot knot) which is secured with a cravat pin or a slightly less formal ruched knot which resembles a four-in-hand tie. A wing collar and cravat may be worn with a black coat but not with a grey one. Cravats have been proscribed in the Royal Enclosure at the Royal Ascot since 2012 and should therefore be treated with caution in any context in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms. Bow ties may be worn as an alternative to the necktie. Although there are photographs of the Duke of Windsor and Sir Winston Churchill wearing bow ties with morning dress, and Debrett's does not proscribe the wearing of one, it is not expressly provided as an option by Debrett's and should therefore be treated with caution in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms. Some style authorities, including Bernhard Roetzel and Nicholas Antongiavanni, advise against the wearing of bow ties with morning dress. Others, such as Nicholas Storey, provide that bow ties may be worn so long as they are obviously not an evening bow tie. = Footwear = Shoes should be of the traditional, highly polished black plain cap-toe Oxford type without brogueing but may include a single line of tooling across the toe cap. The shoes should not be patent leather, which is now reserved for evening formal wear. Although it may be acceptable to wear 'smart-slip on shoes' and monkstraps, it is not ideal to wear either loafers or open-laced shoes, such as derby shoes (or bluchers in American English). In the Victorian and Edwardian era button boots and Oxford boots were worn and these can be correctly worn with morning dress today. When worn at equestrian events, boots of equestrian origin such as jodhpur boots, George boots and Chelsea boots are also acceptable. Socks should be black or grey. Spats were once frequently seen with morning dress, but are now rarely worn and, by 1939, the practise of wearing them was considered to be almost extinct. = Accessories =  Headgear  A. Carnegie and Lord Weardale. While the top hat would be considered the standard, alternatives occur; here a bowler hat. In the Commonwealth of Nations, traditional black, or grey (less formal, but becoming more widely accepted), top hats are considered an optional accessory for weddings. However, hats remain compulsory in the Royal Enclosure at Royal Ascot.  Pocket square  A pocket square should always be worn with morning dress. They may be made from linen, cotton, or silk. Whilst a simple white linen square with rolled edges is classic, they may instead be a solid colour or patterned and should always complement the neckwear. In respect of ties and pocket squares, it is considered particularly elegant to pair one of those accessories, which is made from silk, with the other, made from a non- lustrous material such as linen or cotton. This helps to counterbalance the potential for affectations. Although it is very common practice in wedding parties, many style authorities do not recommend matching a pocket square to a tie as it tends to look contrived, draw attention away from the wearer's face, and display sartorial uncertainty. Pocket squares with a solid colour should generally be paired with a patterned tie (and vice versa) and should not share the same base colour. If the pocket square is patterned, it should likewise not match the tie but instead complement it. It may be puffed or folded into a square, single-point, or multi-pointed style folds. Puffed pocket squares work well with softer materials such as silk; other folds tend to hold their shape better when more structured materials such as linen are used.  Decorations  The wearing of decorations, orders, and medals is uncommon with morning dress. An invitation will generally indicate whether or not they should be worn and, in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth Realms, are more common for religious services or public functions of official significance. Up to four stars, one neck badge, and full-size medals should be worn with morning dress; when a neck badge and star are worn together, they must be of different orders. Etiquette: \\"morning dress\\" Men in morning dress for a wedding (1929) Men wear morning dress when members of a wedding party. In common with court dress, mess dress, and white tie, morning dress is for prestigious and important social occasions. Despite its name, morning dress may be worn to afternoon social events before five o'clock, but not to events beginning after six o'clock in the evening; the term \\"morning\\" is best understood as \\"daylight\\". In Europe, the groom sets the sartorial tone: the guests may wear morning dress if he does. = Equivalents for men = Following the etiquette of formal wear, morning dress being its civilian day wear, there are several equivalents. White tie is the correct, equivalent formal dress for evening social events. The cutaway front of the morning tail coat differs from the evening tail coat (dress coat) in that the waist of the former is cut obliquely while the waist of the latter is cut horizontally, and the tail is cut differently from the swallow tailcoat used for evening dress. The skirt waist construction of the coats is equestrian in origin, to ease the wearer's riding his horse. = Equivalents for women = Women should wear 'smart daywear', such as a smart day dress or a skirt worn with a jacket. The straps of tops and dresses should be at least one inch wide even if worn with a jacket or other covering. Strapless, off-the-shoulder, one shoulder, halter neck, sheer, bardot, and spaghetti straps are not permitted in the Royal Enclosure at the Royal Ascot and may be inadvisable at other occasions that require morning dress. Dresses and skirts should be neither too short nor too revealing. At their shortest, they should fall just above the knee. Trouser suits and smart jumpsuits are permissible at the Royal Ascot but must be ankle length. With trouser suits, the coat and trousers should match in both material and colour. Jumpsuits must also comply with the regulations that apply to skirts and dresses. At the most formal of occasions and the races, dresses and skirts should be worn with a tailored jacket. A bolero, shrug, or pashmina may otherwise be worn. Daytime shoes, such as wedges, should be worn rather than very high heels or evening-style shoes and ought to be comfortable enough to wear for several hours. Tights should always be worn. Hats should be worn in the Royal Enclosure at the Royal Ascot but are optional at weddings. They should be a style that is securely fitted and may be worn throughout the day. Hats should neither be so large or cumbersome that they hamper kissing nor too small. The Royal Ascot does not permit fascinators within the Royal Enclosure. Headpieces may be worn instead of a hat but must have a solid base of at least 10 cm. Daytime jewellery, such as pearls, add an extra flourish of style. A shoulder bag is often preferable to a clutch purse, especially for mothers at weddings. Contemporary use Morning dress worn at a Catholic Procession of the Holy Blood in Bruges, Belgium (2009) = Commonwealth of Nations = Other than certain weddings, and royal, governmental or municipal audiences, morning dress may be seen at some social season events, e.g. horse races such as the Royal Enclosure of Royal Ascot, the Queen's Stand of Epsom Derby, or the Victoria Derby in Australia. It may also be seen sometimes worn at church services in St Paul's Cathedral, London, and St Giles' Cathedral, Edinburgh. Other occasions include certain City of London institutions including fraternal orders, gentlemen's clubs, livery companies and guilds. It also exists as school uniforms at some of United Kingdom's most traditional schools, such as Harrow (on Sundays) and Eton. Morning dress may be worn by male members of a wedding party around Commonwealth of Nations countries, including Australia, and New Zealand. Men at upper and upper-middle class weddings usually wear their own morning coats and their own ties. On these occasions they may wear their old public (U.S.: private) school ties. It is occasionally worn by the British working class (constituting the majority of the population) for only the wedding party to wear morning 'suits'. These tend to be hired and far more co-ordinated than those worn by their upper-middle and upper-class counterparts. The men usually dress in identical, hired, outfits along with identical ties, handkerchiefs and waistcoats. =United States= Joseph Douglass in morning dress with grandfather Frederick Douglass in frock coat (circa 1890s) In the U.S., the morning coat is sometimes referred to as a cutaway coat. In the U.S., morning dress is rare; it usually is worn in traditional weddings and political formal events, although the Kennedy inauguration of 1961 was the last use for that ceremony. In Virginia, morning dress is worn by a governor-elect when sworn to office. The United States Solicitor General and deputies wear morning coats during oral argument before the United States Supreme Court, as do the Marshal and Clerk of the court during all sessions of the court, unless they are female. Morning dress has recurred in the traditional Easter parade associated with Fifth Avenue in New York City.

He led a noted Pietism revival known as the Haugean movement. Hauge is also considered to have been influential in the early industrialization of Norway.Steinar Thorvaldsen. Hans Nielsen Hauge 200-year Jubileum. Troms√∏ University College (Norwegian). Biography Hans Nielsen Hauge was born the fifth of ten children in his ancestral farm of Hauge at Rolvs√∏y (Hauge p√• Rolvs√∏y) in the county of √òstfold. His father was Niels Mikkelsen Evenr√∏d (1732‚Äì1813) and mother Maria Olsdatter Hauge (1735‚Äì1811). He had a poor and otherwise ordinary youth until 5 April 1796, when he received his \\"spiritual baptism\\" in a field near his farm. Within two months, he had founded a revival movement in his own community, written a book, and decided to take his mission on the road. He wrote a series of books in his lifetime. In a total of 18 years, he published 33 books. Estimates are that 100,000 Norwegians read one or more of them, at a time when the population was 900,000 more-or-less literate individuals.\\"Hans Nielsen Hauge ‚Äì norsk legpredikant,\\" Store norske leksikon. In the next several years, Hauge traveled ‚Äì mostly by foot ‚Äì throughout much of Norway. He held countless revival meetings, often after church services. In addition to his religious work, he offered practical advice, encouraging such things as settlements in Northern Norway. He and his followers were persecuted, though their teachings were in keeping with Lutheran doctrine. He began preaching about \\"the living faith\\" in Norway and Denmark after a mystical experience that he believed called him to share the assurance of salvation with others. At the time, itinerant preaching and religious gatherings held without the supervision of a pastor were illegal, and Hauge was arrested several times.Steinar Thorvaldsen (2010). A Prophet Behind the Plough. University of Troms√∏, Eureka Digital. Hauge faced great personal suffering and state persecution. He was imprisoned no less than 14 times between 1794 and 1811, accused of witchcraft and adultery, and of violating the Conventicle act of 1741 (Konventikkelplakaten) at a time in which Norwegians did not have the right of religious assembly without a Church of Norway minister present. His time in prison broke his health and led to his premature death. Upon his release from prison in 1811, he took up work as a farmer and industrialist at Bakkehaugen near Christiania (now Oslo).Lars Walker, \\"An American, Unawares ,\\" The American Spectator (Oct. 16, 2007).James Kiefer, \\"Hans Nielsen Hauge 28 March 1824\\" (Lutheran Calendar, March 29) In 1815, he married Andrea Andersdatter, who later died in childbirth that same year. In 1817, he married Ingeborg Marie Olsdatter (1791‚Äì1872) and bought the Bredtvet farm (now the site of Bredtvet Church in Oslo) where he died. Three of his four children died in infancy. His surviving son, Andreas Hauge, became a priest in the Church of Norway and Member of the Norwegian Parliament. Haugean movement Haugianerne by Adolph Tidemand (1848‚Äì1852) It is generally agreed that Hans Nielsen Hauge had a profound influence on both secular and religious history in Norway. Soltvedt, Susanne (1999) Hans Nielson Hauge: The Influence of the Hauge Movement on Women of Norway (University of Wisconsin-La Crosse) Alison H. Stibbe, Hans Nielsen Hauge and the Prophetic Imagination. (Doctoral thesis, University of London. 2007.) Hauge's message emphasized the type of spirituality he felt originated with Martin Luther. He led charismatic meetings, and his organization became an informal network that in many ways challenged the establishment of the state church. As a result, he and his followers were persecuted in various ways. Hauge was imprisoned on several occasions, spending a total of nine years in prison.Britt G. Hallqvist, \\"A word from one of the authors of Captive and Free ,\\" Augsburg Now. Augsburg College. Minneapolis, MN. Fall 1997, Vol. 60, No. 1. Over time the Haugean movement increased its influence throughout the country. Some figures might illustrate that fact. In the late eighteenth century a normal service at a church in Christiania would be attended by fewer than 20 people ‚Äì of a population of nearly 10,000. Christianity in Norway was nearly becoming a framework for traditions, and ethics (from a Christian perspective) and spiritual life were nearly non-existent. It is not an exaggeration to state that he revived the faith in most of Norway. Both men women played a central role in this revival. The first female preacher of the Haugean movement was Sara Oust, who was active from the year 1799.Sara Oust, Norsk Biografisk Lexikon Turning to his achievements as an industrialist, the number of factories and mills that Hauge founded around the country were numerous. All but one disappeared during the industrial revolution, which in Norway took place in the mid-19th century. In 1809, the government temporarily released Hauge from prison so that he could construct salt factories to help alleviate the salt shortage caused by the British Blockade. Even so, his modesty prevented him from becoming a capitalist, and he gave away all he had founded and inspired to others ‚Äì brethren and friends. During a period of extreme economic crisis, when almost all the prosperous timber barons and iron works owners went bankrupt because of the Napoleonic wars, he showed a way to prosperity for anyone with initiative, and this led to the new rise in Norwegian economics some years after national independence in 1814. In this matter Hauge was but one of several contributors, but he was one of the most influential ‚Äì especially so in the way he combined economics and Christian morals: modesty, honesty and hard work among them.\\"Hans Nielsen Hauge ‚Äì utdypning,\\" Store norske leksikon. Hans Nielsen Hauge gravestone at Old Aker Church, Oslo Factors in influence * His defiance toward the religious and secular establishment gave voice to ordinary people, paving much of the way for the liberal and democratic tradition in Norway. * His theology, while bound in Lutheran doctrine, revitalized the notion of universal religion in Norway. The Norwegian state church credits him today for making religion a personal obligation. * His travels created nationwide networks that persist in Norway's political system generally and among parties in particular. * His advocacy for common people became an important force as the industrial revolution unfolded in Norway. Legacy Many Haugeans launched industrial action, such as mills, shipyards, paper mills, textile industry and printing. They had often worked their way up to prosperity in a short time, a result of Haugean focus on diligence, economic enterprise and frugality. Three members of the constitutional assembly in Eidsvoll belonged to his movement.Magnus, Alv Johan (1978). Revival And Society: An Examination of the Haugean Revival and its Influence on Norwegian Society in the 19th Century. Magister Thesis in Sociology at the University of Oslo. Because Hauge's preaching coincided with the years during which many Norwegians were migrating to America, the Haugean influence on Lutheranism in America has been considerable. The Lutheran Church in America had a Hauge Synod, Eielsen Synod and Lutheran Free Church all indicative of that influence.Semmingsen, Ingrid Gaustad. Norwegian Emigration to America During the Nineteenth Century. Norwegian-American Historic Association. Volume XI: p. 66.Soltvedt, Susanne (1999) Hans Nielson Hauge: The Influence of the Hauge Movement on Women of Norway . Murphy Library, University of Wisconsin, La Crosse, Undergraduate Research. Hauge is remembered on the liturgical calendar of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America on March 29 as one of the Renewers of the Church.James E. Kiefer: Hans Nielsen Hauge, Renewer of the Church (justus.anglican.org) Obelisk at Bredtvet Church outside Oslo erected in memory of Hans Nielsen Hauge Hauge Institute The Hauge Institute (Haugeinstituttet) was founded in 2005. The institute seeks to raise awareness about Hans Nielsen Hauge, his ethical thinking and topicality and to impart inspiration to the business and educational community as well as society in general. Based on the thinking and practice of Hans Nielsen Hauge, the Hauge Institute focuses on the ethical dimension in three main areas: leadership, entrepreneurship, and trade and the environment. The Hauge Institute has several professional partners. Two of the most important are St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota and the Norwegian School of Economics in Bergen, Norway.

The Scene is meant to be hidden from the public, only being shared with those within the community. However, as files were commonly leaked outside the community and their popularity grew, some individuals from The Scene began leaking files and uploading them to filehosts, torrents and ed2k. The Scene has no central leadership, location, or other organizational conventions. The groups themselves create a ruleset for each Scene category (for example, MP3 or TV) that then becomes the active rules for encoding material. These rulesets include a rigid set of requirements that warez groups (grps) must follow in releasing and managing material. The groups must follow these rules when uploading material and, if the release has a technical error or breaks a rule, other groups may \\"nuke\\" (flag as bad content) the release. Groups are in constant competition to get releases up as fast as possible, even though there are no real rewards for their work (except for access to The Scene). First appearing around the time of BBSes, The Scene is composed primarily of people dealing with and distributing media content for which special skills and advanced software are required. History The warez scene started emerging in the 1970s, used by predecessors of software cracking and reverse engineering groups. Their work was made available on privately run bulletin board systems (BBSes). The first BBSes were located in the U.S., but similar boards started appearing in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and mainland Europe. At the time, setting up a machine capable of distributing data was not trivial and required a certain amount of technical skill. The reason it was usually done was for technical challenge. The BBSes typically hosted several megabytes of material. The best boards had multiple phone lines and up to one hundred megabytes of storage space, which was very expensive at the time. Releases were mostly games and later software. As the world of software development evolved to counter the distribution of material and as the software and hardware needed for distribution became readily available to anyone, The Scene adapted to the changes and turned from simple distribution to actual cracking of the protections and non-commercial reverse engineering. As many groups of people who wanted to do this emerged, a requirement for promotion of individual groups became evident, which prompted the evolution of the Artscene, which specialized in the creation of graphical art associated with individual groups. The groups would promote their abilities with ever more sophisticated and advanced software, graphical art, and later also music (demoscene).The BBS Documentary ‚Äì MOVIE The subcommunities (artscene, demoscene, etc.), which were doing nothing illegal, eventually branched off. The programs containing the group promotional material (coding/graphical/musical presentations) evolved to become separate programs distributed through The Scene and were nicknamed Intros and later Cracktros. The demoscene grew especially strong in Scandinavia, where annual gatherings are hosted. Release procedure When releasing material, groups must first encode properly so as not to be nuked, which shows up as a cautionary flag to potential users. After encoding, they upload the files to a topsite that is a FTP server where all the files originate. When the upload is complete, they execute a command that causes the name and category of the release to be announced in the topsite's IRC channel. New releases are also announced 0sec (meaning seconds to minutes after official scene pre) on various public websites. This is called a \\"pre\\" release. Once this is done, all other releases for the same material are nuked as duplicates (\\"dupes\\"). However, if there is a technical error or the file breaks the ruleset for the category, the original \\"pre\\" release will be nuked. Other groups then encode the same material and release it with a \\"PROPER\\" tag in the filename. The same group may re-encode the file, with the new release marked as \\"REPACK\\". This FTP server and IRC are hidden and closed to the public. Each release in The Scene consists of a folder containing the material (sometimes split into RAR pieces), plus an NFO and SFV file. The NFO is a text file which has essential information about the files encoded, including a reason for the nuke if the file is a PROPER or REPACK release. A robust NFO file may contain a group's mission statement, recruitment requirements, greetings, and contact info; many groups have a standard ASCII art template for the file, with the most prolific exhibiting elaborate artistic examples. The SFV file uses checksums to ensure that the files of a release are working properly and have not been damaged or tampered with. This is typically done with the aid of an external executable like QuickSFV or SFV Checker. Failure to include an NFO or SFV file in the release will generally result in a nuke, as these are essential components of the warez standard to which The Scene adheres. In 2012, the Scene had over 100 active groups releasing material. Over 1,000 releases are made each day, with a cumulative total of more than five million releases through 2012. Crackers and reverse engineers Cracking has been the core element of The Scene since its beginning. This part of The Scene community specializes in the creation of software cracks and keygens. The challenge of cracking and reverse engineering complicated software is what makes it an attraction. The game cracking group SKIDROW described it as follows in one of their NFO files: The game ripping group MYTH expressed it as follows in their NFO files: David Grime, former DrinkOrDie member, describes the motivation of the warez scene as follows: \\"It's all about stature.

Originally completed in 1938 and named the 4-H Club and Student Activities Building, it was soon renamed Gallagher Hall to honor wrestling coach Ed Gallagher. After renovations in 1987, the name became Gallagher-Iba Arena, as a tribute to longtime basketball coach and innovator Henry Iba. History The first basketball game was played on December 9, 1938, when Iba's Oklahoma A&M; Aggies beat Phog Allen's Kansas Jayhawks, 21‚Äì15, in a battle between two of the nation's early basketball powers. In its original configuration, seating was limited to 9,000. The original maple floor, still in use today, was the most expensive of its kind in America when it was installed in 1938. The first wrestling dual in the newly renamed Gallagher Hall was held on January 27, 1939, against Indiana with A&M; winning 18‚Äì6. The distinction of being the first A&M; (Oklahoma State) wrestler to compete in Gallagher Hall goes to three-time NCAA champion Joe McDaniel of Sulphur, OK. McDaniel defeated Donnacher of Indiana, 13‚Äì2. On February 3, 1989, the Oklahoma State Cowboys hosted the Hoosiers in a celebration of the 50-year anniversary of the first Gallagher Hall dual. The Cowboys defeated the Hoosiers, 28‚Äì6. Former wrestling coach Myron Roderick claimed that during the 1978 Big 8 Conference Finals, over 9,000 fans packed the old barn and saw unranked Daryl Monasmith beat the defending national champion from Iowa State, Frank Santana. According to Roderick, \\"It got so loud, a lot of the lights busted in Gallagher. And that √≠s the loudest I've ever heard it. It was unbelievable.\\" \\"Gallagher's House of Horrors\\" The Pokes set a new wrestling attendance record in the first season after expansion, packing in 10,802 for Bedlam on February 18, 2001. Previously, the largest crowd was estimated at 8,300. Since wrestling began in Gallagher-Iba Arena, the Cowboys have won 34 NCAA titles and have had 34 unbeaten and untied campaigns at home. One of their longest winning streaks ran with the arena's opening in 1939 and lasted until February 16, 1951. During that period, Oklahoma State won 37 straight home duals, including no ties. From the final dual of 1959 through the first five home duals of the 1967 season, Oklahoma State wrestled 61 duals without a loss, finishing with an impressive 60‚Äì0‚Äì1 record before the streak was broken by Bedlam rival Oklahoma 19‚Äì13. On February 3, 1939, Oklahoma A&M; wrestled for the first time inside the arena, defeating Indiana 18‚Äì6. On February 3, 1989, the Oklahoma State Cowboys hosted the Hoosiers in a celebration of the 50-year anniversary of the first Gallagher Hall dual. The Cowboys defeated the Hoosiers, 28‚Äì6, in the 1989 dual. OSU's latest home winning streak of 50 consecutive duals was the second-longest such streak without a loss or tie (it began near the end of the 1986 season). That streak came to an end on January 30, 1993, when Penn State handed the Pokes a sound 38‚Äì7 defeat, Oklahoma State's worst loss ever on its home mat. In only five seasons have OSU teams lost more than one home dual during the season, including the 1992‚Äì93 season when OSU finished below .500 for the first time ever in Gallagher-Iba Arena. In contrast, six Cowboy teams have won at least 10 home duals during a single season. The modern Gallagher-Iba In the 1990s, Oklahoma State was in desperate need of a larger basketball arena. Instead of building a new arena off campus, the decision was made to expand Gallagher-Iba Arena from a modest 6,381 seats to its current 13,611 seats. The structure of the new Gallagher-Iba Arena was built around the old arena during the basketball season to allow games to be played, essentially the new Athletics Center encapsulated the old gym. Once the exterior was nearly completed, the roof of the old arena was dismantled. The old sightlines and the original white maple floor were kept (it remains the oldest original basketball court floor still in use). The expansion, completed in time for the 2000 Cowboy basketball season, cost $55 million and was designed by Gary Sparks and built by Manhattan Construction. The Cowboys opened the new Gallagher-Iba Arena with a 70‚Äì60 victory over the Arkansas- Little Rock Trojans. Gallagher-Iba Arena was named the best college gymnasium by CBS SportsLine.com in August 2001. On January 15, 2005, the court was officially named after Eddie Sutton as Eddie Sutton Court. On March 4, 2005, ESPNU held its debut, which was simulcast on ESPN2, at Gallagher-Iba Arena. To commemorate the event, 3 Doors Down provided a free concert at the arena. The OSU Basketball team and coaches, including Eddie Sutton, were present at the event. On January 12, 2008, Gallagher-Iba played host to the highest attended women's sporting event in the state of Oklahoma 13,611 (a sellout) as the OSU Cowgirls beat the Oklahoma Sooners in basketball 82‚Äì63. Along with the expansion of the historic arena, the new Athletics Center has many features. A total of 14 luxury suites stretch across the west side of the facility, overlooking both the basketball court and the football field. Banners signifying the success of Oklahoma State Athletics are hung from the rafters, as well as a banner commemorating the loss of 10 members of the OSU basketball family when they were killed in a plane crash in Colorado. The pride of OSU athletic triumphs are also illustrated in photographic and trophy displays in \\"Heritage Hall\\", the west first floor hallway. In the southeast concourse, two seats are permanently reserved for the arena's namesakes. Spirit Rider The original Spirit Rider statue sits outside of the Sherman E. Smith training facility across from Boone Pickens Stadium. The Spirit Rider wears a cowboy hat, rides a black horse named Bullet, and carries an OSU flag. The Spirit Rider can also be found inside the arena in the southwest corner. This Spirit Rider kneels with his hat off, in front of a memorial for the 10 men who died in a 2001 plane crash. Camp Sutton Oklahoma State students have begun referring to their temporary towns as \\"Camp Sutton\\", in honor of retired head coach Eddie Sutton. Twin cities of tents are pitched on the north and south sides of the arena, in hopes of securing floor seats in either the northside or southside student sections. In recent years, Camp Sutton has grown into an increasingly over-the-top affair. Many students played a part in the Camp Sutton campout from January 11, 2007 to February 27, 2007 (Four days before the Texas game and up to the K-State game.) The camp lasted from the second Oklahoma State University Big 12 home game to the last Big 12 home game of the season. Several groups of student campers from the Northside Nasties and the Southside Savages all joined together and lived under over of tarps duct taped and tied together, nicknamed the Thunderdome. It was occupied every day (except times during sporting events) for the entire campout. Although students had camped outside Gallagher-Iba Arena for years, the name Camp Sutton was added during January 2006. Coincidentally, this would be Eddie's last season as head coach. Students are now be required to register tents in order of arrival, beginning four days before the game and continuing on. During this time period, at least one member of the \\"tent\\" was required to be present. A tent being ten people or less, this means that several students weathered freezing temperatures and sleepless nights in order to obtain seating to basketball games. The first game under the new procedures was the Bedlam game of 2006, with over 55 tents registering. The new policy was so successful that around 400 students were granted admission in six minutes, and the Athletic Department saw the value of providing safe and fair admissions to students based upon arrival times. During the 2006‚Äì07 men's basketball season, the camp was moved to the south side of Boone Pickens Stadium. This was done to provide more electrical outlets to the campers, and to provide a wind block from the prevailing northerly, and generally quite strong, Oklahoma winter winds. The policy was in effect from the second home Big 12 game until the last Big 12 home game of the season.

He is known as \\"Canada's Polka King.\\" He has received twenty-one nominations for Grammy Awards and won three. Early life Born in Duparquet, Quebec in 1935, his family moved to St. Catharines, Ontario, when he was a boy. A young Ostanek received his first accordion as a gift in 1944.http://www.570news.com/2016/10/10/adams-1st-oktoberfest-day-2-meet-polka- king/ After several years, Ostanek became a popular entertainer in Southern Ontario, performing Slovenian-style (also known as Cleveland-style) polkas and waltzes. He could be heard frequently on the radio in St. Catharines and Welland. Walter began playing polka after his best friend introduced him to the accordion at age 5. Career In 1957 Ostanek formed his own band playing Slovenian-style polka music. In 1963, Ostanek and his band, the Walter Ostanek Band, would record their first of many albums. Over his career, Ostanek would record more than 50 albums and become known as Canada's Polka King. He has received three Grammy Awards and he has been nominated thirteen times. His style has been compared to America's Polka King, Frankie Yankovic of Cleveland. Like the late Yankovic, Walter Ostanek is of Slovene descent. Ostanek (right) appearing at the 2006 Kitchener-Waterloo Oktoberfest Ostanek hosted his own television shows (one for fourteen consecutive years), radio shows, and polka tours. He has appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, Phil Donahue, Tommy Hunter Show, Cleveland's Polka Varieties, and his own award-winning TV specials and telethons. He has appeared in concert with Roy Clark, The Oak Ridge Boys, Ronnie Milsap, Ray Price, Mel Tillis, Brenda Lee, Slim Whitman, Tom T. Hall, T. G. Sheppard, Tommy Hunter, Lawrence Welk, Myron Floren, Frank Yankovic, Black Forest Band, and Weiss Blau. Ostanek is a member of Canada's Walk of Fame as well as the Polka Halls of Fame in Cleveland and Chicago. Currently Ostanek does two main concert sets each year: one at Marineland in Niagara Falls, Ontario, the other during Oktoberfest in Kitchener, Ontario. He is also the subject of the 2006 Bravo! network documentary The Cult of Walt: Canada's Polka King. Ostanek is also cited as the inspiration for the Second City Television polka parody, the Shmenge Brothers. and the Osler show. In 2007, Ostanek was the recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award at the annual SOCAN Awards in Toronto.http://www.socan.ca/about/awards/2007-socan-awards Ostanek currently resides in St. Catharines, Ontario.

It was also known as UMIPS or MIPS OS. RISC/os was based largely on UNIX System V with additions from 4.3BSD UNIX, ported to the MIPS architecture. It was a \\"dual-universe\\" operating system, meaning that it had separate, switchable runtime environments providing compatibility with either System V Release 3 or 4.3BSD. MIPS OS was one of the first 32-bit operating systems for RISC-based workstation-class computers. It was also one of the first 64-bit Unix releases for RISC based microprocessors, with the first 64-bit versions appearing in 1990. MIPS OS supported full 32-bit and 64-bit applications simultaneously using the underlying hardware architecture supporting the MIPS-IV instruction set. Later releases added support for System V Release 4 compatibility, R6000 processor support and later symmetric multiprocessing support on the R4400 and R6000 processors. During the early 1990s, several vendors including DEC, Silicon Graphics, and Ardent licensed portions of the software MIPS had written for the RISC/os for their own Unix variants. Evans & Sutherland licensed RISC/os directly for its ESV series workstations. MIPS' influence was most visible as the C compiler and development tools shared by virtually all commercial Unixes for the MIPS processor, the low memory operating system code, and the ROM code for MIPS processors. Because of its early UNIX heritage, RISC/os was limited in comparison to modern UNIX variants for example, even the last releases of RISC/os did not support shared libraries. In July 1992, Silicon Graphics purchased MIPS Computer Systems for $220M. Support for RISC/os was subsequently phased out.

Mainly consisting of priests, peasants, merchants and local lords who followed the sect, they sometimes associated with non-followers of the sect. They were at first organized to only a small degree; if any single person could be said to have had any influence over them it was Rennyo, the leader of the J≈çdo Shinsh≈´ Hongan-ji sect at that time. Whilst he may have used the religious fervour of the Ikk≈ç-ikki in the defence of his temple settlements, he was also careful to distance himself from the wider social rebellion of the Ikk≈ç movement as a whole, and from offensive violence in particular. History According to Sansom, \\"The Ikko (Single-Minded) sect of Nenbutsu, or Buddha-calling ... is a branch of the worship of Amida developed from the teaching of Shinran into an aggressive doctrine of salvation by faith.\\" In the 13th century, the jizamurai, a new class of small landowners, \\"formed leagues (ikki) for mutual defence\\", since they came from \\"good warrior families, long established in their own districts, and they were determined to protect their interests, both economic and social, against newcomers\\", according to Sansom The Shirahata- Ikki, \\"White Flag Uprising\\", and Mikazuki-Ikki, \\"Crescent Uprising\\", were examples of the numerous risings against the Ashikaga shogunate. An uprising involving an entire province was called a Kuni-Ikki (kuni meaning province). Uprisings took place in 1351, 1353, 1369, 1377, 1384‚Äì1386, and 1366‚Äì1369. The risings in the 15th century, Tsuchi-Ikki or Do-Ikki, were better organized \\"and the peasants appear to have played a more prominent part\\". At the conclusion of the ≈ånin War, in 1477, \\"many of the members of the numerous ikki\\" occupied the monasteries and shrines, and \\"would ring the warning bells day and night, hoping to terrify the rich citizens\\", according to Sansom. The Ikk≈ç-ikki were, at first, disparate and disorganized followers of Rennyo's teachings. His missionary work, and his appointment to the position of abbot of the Kyoto Hongan-ji, was in 1457, allowed him to \\"express in words and deeds\\" his unorthodox views. In 1465, Rennyo was forced to flee Kyoto, and established a new Hongan-ji branch temple, Yoshizaki-gob≈ç, in Echizen Province in 1471. It was at this temple that he began to attract a significant following among peasants and farmers. About 1486 brought the first violent uprising, the first major organized action on the part of the Ikk≈ç-ikki. They overthrew the governor of Kaga Province, and took control of it for themselves; this represented the first time in Japanese history that a group of commoners ruled a province. The Ikko-ikki fought Asakura Norikage in the of 1506 and defeated Nagao Tamekage in the 1536 Battle of Sendanno. They fought Asakura Norikage again in the 1555 Battle of Daishoji-omote. Rennyo was a pacifist and taught pacifism. He advocated self-defense only as a guard against the particularly tumultuous times in which he lived. Daimy≈ç, samurai warlords, fought one another for territory nearly constantly, across the entire country. Rennyo thus saw to it that the temples of his sect were fortified and defended from attackers. Though it was his charismatic leadership and populist teachings that inspired the fervor which powered the Ikk≈ç-ikki uprisings, he never advocated or supported them. The uprisings continued nevertheless, past Rennyo's death in 1499, and the sub-sect of J≈çdo Shinsh≈´ that he had founded spread as well. They established themselves in fortresses at Ishiyama Hongan-ji, just outside Osaka, and in Nagashima, on the borders of Owari and Ise Provinces and in a series of temples in Mikawa Province as well. Towards the end of the 16th century, however, their growing numbers and strength caught the attention and concern of the great samurai leaders of the time. Tokugawa Ieyasu worried that s≈çhei of Mikawa Province would rise up and seize the province. In 1564, his forces, with the help of J≈çdo-sh≈´ s≈çhei, defeated the Mikawa Ikk≈ç-ikki in the Battle of Azukizaka. The Battle of Azukizaka was the climactic clash between Ieyasu and the Ikki. The ikki attracted the ire of the likes of Tokugawa Ieyasu and Oda Nobunaga due to the economic and political threat they posed, more so than as a result of their military might. The Ishiyama Hongan-ji and other strongholds of the ikki lay across major trade routes and occupied the same areas that Nobunaga saw as his primary territorial objectives. Nearly every road to the capital from this western part of the country was controlled by the ikki or their allies, and the populist roots of the ikki movement gave them significant economic power as well. Nobunaga in particular sought the destruction of the Ikk≈ç-ikki for these reasons, and because they allied themselves with nearly every one of his major enemies or rivals. Ashikaga Yoshiaki was once strongly supported in his claim to become Sh≈çgun by Nobunaga, but turned to the ikki when their relationship soured. The ikki also had powerful allies in the M≈çri, Azai, and Asakura clans. In the Asakura stronghold of Echizen province, today's Fukui- prefecture, Nobunaga ordered his generals to kill the people in Ajimano village in August 1575 as noted in The Chronicle of Lord Nobunaga. The Ishiyama Hongan-ji and Nagashima fortresses were besieged several times by the forces of Oda Nobunaga. After several failed attempts at seizing each emplacement, he eventually succeeded. In the 1580s, the last of the Ikk≈ç-ikki courted Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and fought alongside his forces against warrior monks of other sects. Weapons, training, and lifestyle The Ikk≈ç-ikki bands of the 16th century, due largely to their origins as countryside mobs, used quite varied armor and armament. Many wore the more traditional monk robes, with varying degrees and types of armor. Some wore various sorts of helmets, while others opted for the straw hat and cloak of a peasant. Naginata remained very common, along with a variety of swords and daggers, and a limited number of arquebuses. Finally, while not truly armor nor armament, a very common item wielded by the mobs of Ikk≈ç-ikki monk warriors was a banner with a Buddhist slogan written upon it. Some of the more common slogans included the nenbutsu chant \\"Hail to Buddha Amida!\\" (Namu Amida Butsu; ÂçóÁÑ°ÈòøÂº•ÈôÄ‰ªè) and \\"He who advances is sure of salvation, but he who retreats will go to hell\\". Shin Buddhism was persecuted in response to the Ikk≈ç-ikki, which caused the formation of kakure nenbutsu secret societies. References Further reading * Dobbins, James C. (1989).

A smooth 4-manifold is a 4-manifold with a smooth structure. In dimension four, in marked contrast with lower dimensions, topological and smooth manifolds are quite different. There exist some topological 4-manifolds which admit no smooth structure, and even if there exists a smooth structure, it need not be unique (i.e. there are smooth 4-manifolds which are homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic). 4-manifolds are important in physics because in General Relativity, spacetime is modeled as a pseudo-Riemannian 4-manifold. Topological 4-manifolds The homotopy type of a simply connected compact 4-manifold only depends on the intersection form on the middle dimensional homology. A famous theorem of implies that the homeomorphism type of the manifold only depends on this intersection form, and on a \\\\Z/2\\\\Z invariant called the Kirby‚ÄìSiebenmann invariant, and moreover that every combination of unimodular form and Kirby‚ÄìSiebenmann invariant can arise, except that if the form is even, then the Kirby‚ÄìSiebenmann invariant must be the signature/8 (mod 2). Examples: *In the special case when the form is 0, this implies the 4-dimensional topological Poincar√© conjecture. *If the form is the E8 lattice, this gives a manifold called the E8 manifold, a manifold not homeomorphic to any simplicial complex. *If the form is \\\\Z, there are two manifolds depending on the Kirby‚ÄìSiebenmann invariant: one is 2-dimensional complex projective space, and the other is a fake projective space, with the same homotopy type but not homeomorphic (and with no smooth structure). *When the rank of the form is greater than about 28, the number of positive definite unimodular forms starts to increase extremely rapidly with the rank, so there are huge numbers of corresponding simply connected topological 4-manifolds (most of which seem to be of almost no interest). Freedman's classification can be extended to some cases when the fundamental group is not too complicated; for example, when it is \\\\Z, there is a classification similar to the one above using Hermitian forms over the group ring of \\\\Z. If the fundamental group is too large (for example, a free group on 2 generators), then Freedman's techniques seem to fail and very little is known about such manifolds. For any finitely presented group it is easy to construct a (smooth) compact 4-manifold with it as its fundamental group. As there is no algorithm to tell whether two finitely presented groups are isomorphic (even if one is known to be trivial) there is no algorithm to tell if two 4-manifolds have the same fundamental group. This is one reason why much of the work on 4-manifolds just considers the simply connected case: the general case of many problems is already known to be intractable. Smooth 4-manifolds For manifolds of dimension at most 6, any piecewise linear (PL) structure can be smoothed in an essentially unique way,. so in particular the theory of 4 dimensional PL manifolds is much the same as the theory of 4 dimensional smooth manifolds. A major open problem in the theory of smooth 4-manifolds is to classify the simply connected compact ones. As the topological ones are known, this breaks up into two parts: # Which topological manifolds are smoothable? # Classify the different smooth structures on a smoothable manifold. There is an almost complete answer to the first problem of which simply connected compact 4-manifolds have smooth structures. First, the Kirby‚ÄìSiebenmann class must vanish. *If the intersection form is definite Donaldson's theorem gives a complete answer: there is a smooth structure if and only if the form is diagonalizable. *If the form is indefinite and odd there is a smooth structure. *If the form is indefinite and even we may as well assume that it is of nonpositive signature by changing orientations if necessary, in which case it is isomorphic to a sum of m copies of II1,1 and 2n copies of E8(‚àí1) for some m and n. If m ‚â• 3n (so that the dimension is at least 11/8 times the signature) then there is a smooth structure, given by taking a connected sum of n K3 surfaces and m ‚àí 3n copies of S2√óS2. If m ‚â§ 2n (so the dimension is at most 10/8 times the signature) then Furuta proved that no smooth structure exists . This leaves a small gap between 10/8 and 11/8 where the answer is mostly unknown. (The smallest case not covered above has n=2 and m=5, but this has also been ruled out, so the smallest lattice for which the answer is not currently known is the lattice II7,55 of rank 62 with n=3 and m=7. See . for recent (as of 2019) progress in this area.) The \\"11/8 conjecture\\" states that smooth structures do not exist if the dimension is less than 11/8 times the signature. In contrast, very little is known about the second question of classifying the smooth structures on a smoothable 4-manifold; in fact, there is not a single smoothable 4-manifold where the answer is known. Donaldson showed that there are some simply connected compact 4-manifolds, such as Dolgachev surfaces, with a countably infinite number of different smooth structures. There are an uncountable number of different smooth structures on R4; see exotic R4. Fintushel and Stern showed how to use surgery to construct large numbers of different smooth structures (indexed by arbitrary integral polynomials) on many different manifolds, using Seiberg‚ÄìWitten invariants to show that the smooth structures are different. Their results suggest that any classification of simply connected smooth 4-manifolds will be very complicated. There are currently no plausible conjectures about what this classification might look like. (Some early conjectures that all simply connected smooth 4-manifolds might be connected sums of algebraic surfaces, or symplectic manifolds, possibly with orientations reversed, have been disproved.) Special phenomena in 4-dimensions There are several fundamental theorems about manifolds that can be proved by low-dimensional methods in dimensions at most 3, and by completely different high-dimensional methods in dimension at least 5, but which are false in dimension 4. Here are some examples: *In dimensions other than 4, the Kirby‚ÄìSiebenmann invariant provides the obstruction to the existence of a PL structure; in other words a compact topological manifold has a PL structure if and only if its Kirby‚ÄìSiebenmann invariant in H4(M,Z/2Z) vanishes. In dimension 3 and lower, every topological manifold admits an essentially unique PL structure. In dimension 4 there are many examples with vanishing Kirby‚ÄìSiebenmann invariant but no PL structure. *In any dimension other than 4, a compact topological manifold has only a finite number of essentially distinct PL or smooth structures. In dimension 4, compact manifolds can have a countable infinite number of non-diffeomorphic smooth structures. *Four is the only dimension n for which Rn can have an exotic smooth structure. R4 has an uncountable number of exotic smooth structures; see exotic R4. *The solution to the smooth Poincar√© conjecture is known in all dimensions other than 4 (it is usually false in dimensions at least 7; see exotic sphere). The Poincar√© conjecture for PL manifolds has been proved for all dimensions other than 4, but it is not known whether it is true in 4 dimensions (it is equivalent to the smooth Poincar√© conjecture in 4 dimensions). *The smooth h-cobordism theorem holds for cobordisms provided that neither the cobordism nor its boundary has dimension 4. It can fail if the boundary of the cobordism has dimension 4 (as shown by Donaldson). If the cobordism has dimension 4, then it is unknown whether the h-cobordism theorem holds. *A topological manifold of dimension not equal to 4 has a handlebody decomposition. Manifolds of dimension 4 have a handlebody decomposition if and only if they are smoothable. *There are compact 4-dimensional topological manifolds that are not homeomorphic to any simplicial complex. In dimension at least 5 the existence of topological manifolds not homeomorphic to a simplicial complex was an open problem. Ciprian Manolescu showed that there are manifolds in each dimension greater than or equal to 5, that are not homeomorphic to a simplicial complex. Failure of the Whitney trick in dimension 4 According to Frank Quinn, \\"Two n-dimensional submanifolds of a manifold of dimension 2n will usually intersect themselves and each other in isolated points. The \\"Whitney trick\\" uses an isotopy across an embedded 2-disk to simplify these intersections. Roughly speaking this reduces the study of n-dimensional embeddings to embeddings of 2-disks. But this not a reduction when the embedding is 4: the 2 disks themselves are middle-dimensional, so trying to embed them encounters exactly the same problems they are supposed to solve. This is the phenomenon that separates dimension 4 from others.\\"  See also  *Kirby calculus *Algebraic surface *3-manifold *5-manifold *Enriques‚ÄìKodaira classification *Casson handle *Akbulut cork References    Geometric topology * ","title":"4-manifold"},{"id":"1362802","text":"Bradley John McGee OAM (born 24 February 1976 in Sydney, New South Wales) is an Australian former professional racing cyclist.

Though technically a vassal of the Duchy of Aquitaine, ruled at that time by William IX, Gaston effectively made B√©arn an autonomous territory. Before becoming viscount, Gaston had fought in the Reconquista in Spain, and he led a B√©arnais contingent on crusade under Raymond IV of Toulouse in 1096. He was one of the lesser knights, but he carried his own standard and commanded his own men. At the siege of Antioch he led one of the divisions in the final battle against Kerbogha. During the power struggle following the capture of Antioch, Gaston deserted Raymond for Godfrey of Bouillon and marched with him to Jerusalem. Gaston and Tancred were sent ahead of the main army to occupy Bethlehem, and during the siege of Jerusalem, Gaston was in charge of Godfrey's siege engines. On July 15, 1099, Gaston was the first crusader to enter the city. Gaston's experience in the Reconquista taught him that Muslims could live under Christian rule, as Mud√©jar. He preferred negotiation and dialogue to senseless massacre, and he and Tancred tried to protect some of the Muslims of Jerusalem by sheltering them in the Temple. However, these Muslims too were soon killed by other crusaders, infuriating Gaston and Tancred. In August, Gaston led part of the centre line of the crusader army at the Battle of Ascalon. After the victory there, Gaston returned home with his men, as did most of the other crusaders. Gaston was a pious man, and upon his return to B√©arn he oversaw the construction of many churches destined to shelter pilgrims on the route to Santiago de Compostela. He also allowed the abbey of St. Foy to establish new buildings in Morl√†as. He also came into conflict with the church, however; he successfully defended his claims to the territories of the abbey of St. Vincent de Lucq and the monastery of St. Mont. He died in 1131 and was succeeded by his young son Centulle VI, with Tal√®se acting as regent. Tal√®se wanted to unite B√©arn and Aragon; the two were, at the time, roughly equal in power and influence, but Aragon instead united with Catalonia and B√©arn began to decline. Gaston's descendants Gaston VI and Gaston VII participated in the Albigensian Crusade and the Seventh Crusade, respectively.

Chartered in 1728, it is the oldest private school in Virginia and the eighth oldest school in the United States. In 1966, Norfolk Academy merged with Country Day School for Girls in Virginia Beach, Virginia to create the current co-educational school. It serves students in Chesapeake, Norfolk, Portsmouth, Virginia Beach, and Suffolk. In sports, NA competes in the Tidewater Conference of Independent Schools (TCIS) as well as in the Virginia Preparatory League (males) and the League of Independent Schools (females). History The original Norfolk Academy building was designed by architect Thomas Ustick Walter, who subsequently fourth designed the dome of the U.S. Capitol. The Greek-revival building, featured on the school's current seal (at right), was modeled after the Temple of Thesus in Athens. Subsequently, the building was a military hospital during the American Civil War, a Red Cross building in World War I and from 1920-1970 as the City of Norfolk's Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court, and from 1973 as the City of Norfolk's Chamber of Commerce. and Accompanying photo Originally accessible via downtown Norfolk's Bank Street, the building now sits at the intersection of East Charlotte Street and St. Paul's Boulevard. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. Academics and student life Students are required to research, compose, and deliver to the student body and faculty an original persuasive speech as a graduation requirement. Public Speaking skills are integrated into the curriculum from the 1st grade on. Norfolk Academy's German program was recognized in 2007 as the number one German program in the country among high schools. The College Board recognition for the school and German program has been earned, as the Report notes, through the performance of students on the AP German Language Exam. The ongoing exchange with the Copernicus Gymnasium, L√∂ningen (Germany) has been in place since 1973, and is the longest-running high school student exchange program between the two countries. Athletics Norfolk Academy's athletic program features 74 interscholastic competition for grades 7 ‚Äì 12. 95 percent of Middle School students and at least 85 percent of Upper School students play one sport or more.

Most notable of all these parodies is the 1967 spoof Casino Royale, which was produced using the actual film rights purchased from Ian Fleming over a decade prior to its release. Unlike an imitation, a spoof is usually protected from lawsuits by the people whose property is being parodied. Premise James Bond parodies generally contain several elements, adopted from the James Bond novels and films, which are featured in these parody works. These usually include the following: * The protagonist(s) is a near invincible, secret service agent, who works for a secret government national or international intelligence agency. In some parodies, the hero is recast as a bumbling idiot, who achieves the given objectives through sheer luck or as a fluke and pre-planning. * The protagonist is in frequent contact with beautiful, provocative and often scantily clad women during the course of his assignment. Some of these women are dangerous spies working for the other side. Villains accomplices and some women's costumes, whether they are in league with the seen or hidden villain, are evocative and trendy. * In the original Bond books and films, the chief adversary is usually an evil genius, who heads an international criminal syndicate, which seeks to destroy the current world order, in order to achieve global domination. In the parody, the villain can be a bumbling, over-important, arrogant fool himself. * Much is made of the use of innovative gadgetry, which the protagonist uses to his advantage. * The main villain is sometimes completely unseen behind a chair with a menacing voice, smoking, drinking or stroking a cat. * Humour is an important component of this genre. Flirtatious and suave tact and flair takes first place. * There can be jokes about how stupid or expendable the random anonymous henchman are. There are also various subgenres, within this style. Some of the most notable variants include: a female protagonist(s) (in place of the male), child protagonists, a strong science fiction element (known as spy-fi) and the erotic (adult) spy novel, comic, or film. The term Eurospy refers to the large number of films within this genre which were produced in Europe. Although many of the James Bond parodies were produced in the United States or Europe, the genre is very much an international one, with novels, comics and films being produced across the globe. 2012 London Summer Olympics *In an advertisement for London's 2012 Olympic bid, Roger Moore and Samantha Bond played Bond and Miss Moneypenny. *Daniel Craig played Bond in a short film, Happy and Glorious, made by the BBC, produced by Lisa Osborne, and directed by Danny Boyle as part of the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics. In the film, Bond is summoned to Buckingham Palace by Queen Elizabeth II‚Äîplayed by herself‚Äîand escorts her by helicopter to the Olympic Stadium. Bond and the Queen jump from the helicopter into the stadium with Union Flag parachutes. After the film was shown, the Queen appeared and formally opened the Games. Advertising campaigns *From 1999 to 2006, Guinness promoted its products in Africa using the advertising character, Michael Power (played by Cleveland Mitchell), as the cornerstone of a major marketing campaign. Jo Foster of the BBC referred to Power as \\"Africa's very own 'James Bond'\\". The character was portrayed as having been born in Jamaica and raised in Great Britain. By 2003, it became one of the best-known alcohol advertising campaigns in Africa. *In 2002, Guinness applied the Michael Power formula to Asia with the character Adam King. * In 2012, model Shirley Mallmann appeared in a tribute to the James Bond franchise in celebration of its 50th anniversary for the Brazilian ELLE magazine. She starred in a video directed by Manuel Nogueira titled \\"Bond Girl Reloaded\\", where she dons looks from Alexandre Herchcovitch and Balmain, while battling armed villains, ending in a fiery explosion.

As another variation of the Blofeld trope, the main villain of the film is a white cat himself. * Agent 00-7-11 is a parody of James Bond in the film Ninja Academy (1990).

Drake is even played by former James Bond actor Timothy Dalton. The character Dusty Tails could also be a simultaneous reference to the Bond girl and Shirley Bassey, who sang three of the themes to the James Bond film series. * The 2006 movie of The Pink Panther, Clouseau met a British agent 006 (played by a tuxedo-clad, uncredited Clive Owen), which Inspector Clouseau replies as \\"one short of the big time\\". * Allkopi Royale (2006), a short Bond Spoof starring Thomas Milligan and Quantum for Allkopi (2008), a Sequel to Allkopi Royale, featuring Norwegian celebrities such as Linni Meister, Helge Hammelow-Berg and Martin Garfalk. * Epic Movie (2007) - Bond, from Casino Royale (2006 film), makes two short appearances in Gnarnia. * Meet the Spartans (2008), Le Chiffre appears, torturing Leonidas for the account number in a similar manner to the way he did in Casino Royale.

The first film is set in 1955 and the sequel in 1967. Both movies, which star Jean Dujardin as French secret agent Hubert Bonisseur de La Bath a.k.a. OSS 117, parody and recreate the look and style of espionage films from the 1950s and 1960s. In addition to the above, there have been literally hundreds of films made around the world parodying the spy film genre of the 1960s, if not directly parodying James Bond. One example is the 1966 film Modesty Blaise, which was a parody of the spy genre rather than a faithful adaptation of the (generally serious) comic strip. =Matt Helm= First published in 1960, Matt Helm is a fictional character created by author Donald Hamilton. The character is not meant to be a spoof of James Bond, rather having attributes of an homage, but not in the strict sense. Film versions of Matt Helm, as played by Dean Martin, were meant to spoof the 007 movies as well as the character James Bond. The four movies made took their titles from Hamilton's novels, though the movies had little in common with the books of the same name. The Silencers and Murderers' Row were released in 1966. The Ambushers in 1967 and The Wrecking Crew in 1969. =Austin Powers= Austin Powers is a media franchise created by Canadian comedian Mike Myers. Many of the characters throughout the franchise are parodies of Bond characters, including Myers' character of the same name. According to Myers, he has said that Sean Connery was the inspiration for his character, especially Powers' thick chest hair. In addition, the names of the films are also parodies of Bond novels and films. Films * International Man of Mystery * The Spy Who Shagged Me is an obvious parody of The Spy Who Loved Me. * Goldmember is a parody of Goldfinger. The title of the film led to legal action being taken by MGM, the distributors of the James Bond film franchise, that briefly led to the film's title being removed from promotional material and trailers. During the period when the film had no official title, it was unofficially being called Never Say Member Again, a reference to the non-canon Bond film Never Say Never Again. The dispute was quickly resolved and the original film title remained. Although MGM most likely would have lost a court case against the makers of Goldmember (see: Copyright information on parodies), MGM did secure a spot for the trailer to 2002's Bond film Die Another Day in settlement. Characters * Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the head of SPECTRE and Bond's archenemy, is parodied in all three Austin Powers films as Dr. Evil. Like Blofeld, Dr. Evil has a facial scar over his eye and wears either a white or a grey Nehru jacket (which is also worn by the first Bond villain, Dr. No). Both characters also possess white Persian cats. Dr. Evil's cat, however, loses its hair due to a side- effect of the cryogenic freezing process which preserved Dr. Evil for 30 years. Dr. Evil is a parody of Donald Pleasence's Blofeld. * Basil Exposition, the head of Powers' organisation is meant to be a combined parody of both M and Q. * Alotta Fagina is a parody, in name, of the Bond girl Pussy Galore. * Goldmember, like Auric Goldfinger, also had a passion for gold; he also possessed a golden gun similar to that used by Scaramanga, the villain of The Man with the Golden Gun. * Colonel Rosa Klebb in the Bond film From Russia with Love and Irma Bunt from On Her Majesty's Secret Service are said to be the prototypes of Frau Farbissina, a top villain in Dr. Evil's organisation. * Emilio Largo, the SPECTRE villain from Thunderball is parodied in every Austin Powers films as \\"Number Two\\". * Random Task is identical to Goldfinger's henchman, Oddjob, except he throws a shoe instead of a bowler hat. =Daniel Craig cameo in Star Wars= In the movie Star Wars: The Force Awakens by J.J. Abrams, after the main character, Rey, is captured by the First Order, she uses the Force to convince a stormtrooper into setting her free. The actor who played the stormtrooper was Daniel Craig, and the crew of The Force Awakens unofficially dubbed the character \\"FN-007\\", in reference to Craig's role as James Bond. Fans adopted this name, as well as \\"JB-007\\", for the character. However, the video game Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens identified the character as FN-1824, which is now considered his official name. =Imitative films= Numerous films have attempted to use the James Bond formula; some have used the character of James Bond unofficially. * G-2 (1965), A Filipino movie starring Tony Ferrer as Tony Falcon:Agent X44, the Filipino James Bond equivalent. G-2 was the first of 16 Agent X44 movies released in the Philippines. * Kiss Kiss...Bang Bang (1966), Italian Eurospy film with Giuliano Gemma. * Lightning Bolt aka \\"Operazione Goldman\\" (1966) - one of many low-budget Italian Eurospy films. * One Spy Too Many (1966), feature film release of 2-part TV episode of The Man from U.N.C.L.E.. * Secret Agent Fireball (1966), standard Italian Eurospy film of the period. * Spy in Your Eye (1966), Italian Spy-fi espionage tale. * Agent for H.A.R.M. (1966), failed TV pilot released as a feature film. * Dimension 5 (1966), derivative spy-fi yarn involving time travel. * The Venetian Affair (1967), capitalises on star Robert Vaughn's image from The Man from U.N.C.L.E. series. * Hammerhead (1968), Vince Edwards trades in his Ben Casey scrubs for a tuxedo in this campy, imitative James Bond knock-off. * James Bond 777 (1971), low-budget Indian-made 007 movie with Ghattamaneni Krishna as a pompadoured, moustachioed James Bond. * Shut Up When You Speak (1981), Aldo Maccione plays Giacomo (\\"James\\" in Italian), who dreams that he is James Bond. Original title: Tais Toi Quand Tu Parles. * Agent 000 and the Deadly Curves (1983), Ilmari Saarelainen plays Joonas G. Breitenfeldt, Agent 000, who attempts to stop the masked villain's organisation (a spoof of SPECTRE). Original title: Agentti 000 ja kuoleman kurvit. * Our Man From Bond Street (1984), third in the Mad Mission series, also known as Aces Go Places. A Bond look-alike appears, played by Sean Connery's younger brother Neil, as does Oddjob (though not played by Harold Sakata), and Richard Kiel (though not as Jaws). * The Mahjong Incident (1987), Chinese thriller concerning a priceless jade mahjong piece. James Bond (portrayed by Ron Cohen, an American businessman who just happened to be spotted by the director while on vacation) has a brief cameo. Also known as \\"The Green Jade Mahjongg.\\" * Mr. Bond (1992), Indian-made musical, starring Akshay Kumar. As with several other Bond ripoffs, the character is never referred to as \\"James Bond\\", remaining simply Mr. Bond throughout the entire movie. * XXX (2002), borrows heavily from James Bond and includes gadgets and so forth that are similar to some found in a Bond film. Its sequel, XXX: State of the Union, was directed by Lee Tamahori, who had previously directed Die Another Day. Internet * Season 5 of the YouTube channel Epic Rap Battles of History features a rap-battle video called \\"James Bond vs Austin Powers\\" (released June 14, 2016), which James Bond makes an appearance and is represented by Ben Atha (as the Daniel Craig version) and EpicLLoyd (as the Sean Connery version). * The gadgetry, titles, characters, product promotion and plots were parodied on the site Michael and Joel at the Movies. * Greenpeace UK produced an animated parody called Coalfinger (October 2008), featuring the voices of David Mitchell and Brian Blessed. Music * Johnny Rivers' song \\"Secret Agent Man\\" uses the surf rock style of the James Bond theme. However, although its subject is secret agents and spies, the song was not composed as a reference to Bond but rather as the theme song for American broadcasts of the United Kingdom series Danger Man, which aired in the US under the title Secret Agent. * British rock band Terrorvision's album Regular Urban Survivors (1996) features sleeve artwork reminiscent of spy movies in general, and Bond in particular. It features a painted cover, depicting the band members in a montage of Bond-like poses. *The Cavaliers Drum and Bugle Corps' 2004 show \\"007,\\" which placed first at the DCI World Championship Finals, uses musical selections and takes visual design inspiration from the James Bond movies. * Toy Dolls gives a humorous account of James Bond's off- duty relations to his neighbours in their song \\"James Bond Lives Down Our Street\\". * WAW (Wild Aaron Wilde) released three songs in 2013 on the Total Eclipse label, called \\"Spy Fool\\", \\"Diamonds Are Very Shiny\\", and \\"Old Whinger\\", all in the style of James Bond songs. Novels and comic books *Mack Bolan, alias \\"The Executioner\\", is a tougher, American James Bond- inspired character created by Don Pendleton, who has featured in over 600 serialized novels with sales, as of 1995, of more than 200 million books, and is the subject of an upcoming film franchise. * The Book of Bond, or, Every Man His Own 007, sanctioned by Glidrose Productions, is a tongue-in-cheek guide to being a superspy. It was credited to \\"Lt.-Col. William 'Bill' Tanner\\" (a literary Fleming character), but was actually written by Kingsley Amis, who would subsequently write the Bond novel, Colonel Sun under another pseudonym, Robert Markham. The book's first hardcover edition had a false slipcover giving the title as The Bible to be Read as Literature (in the novel From Russia, with Love, a fake book with this title hides a gun). The paperback edition was published by Pan Books, formatted the same as its regular James Bond novels. * Similarly, James Bond's popularity has spurred other writers and book packagers to cash in on the spy craze by launching female-spy alternative versions, such as The Baroness by Paul Kenyon, The Lady From L.U.S.T. spy thrillers by Rod Gray, and Cherry Delight by Glen Chase. The sexy superspy Baroness novels used many Bond references and formulae, such as the title of the second novel Diamonds Are For Dying, culinary and gastronomic descriptive passages, and plot themes., Paperback Fanatic Vol. 15, 2010. * Michael K. Frith and Christopher B. Cerf of the Harvard Lampoon wrote Alligator (Book), by \\"I*n Fl*m*ng\\" in 1962. Another \\"J*mes B*nd\\" story titled \\"Toadstool\\" appeared in a Playboy magazine parody published by the Lampoon. Rumour has it this has not been reprinted because of plagiarism issues (some sections are very close to Fleming.) The cover of Alligator parodies the Signet Books paperback covers used for the Fleming novels in the 1960s, including a short Fl*m*ng biography, and a bibliography of nonexistent B*nd novels: Lightningrod, For Tomorrow We Live, The Chigro of the Narcissus, Toadstool, Doctor Popocatapetl, From Berlin, Your Obedient Servant, Monsieur Butterfly, and Scuba Do - Or Die. * There exists a very short book titled Pussy L'amour and the Three Bears starring James Bear. Although the book James Bond: The Legacy mentions it, one known copy exists. * 007 -The James Bomb Musical An April 1965 Mad Magazine musical based on the James Bond films where the mysterious head of the evil organisation trying to kill 007 is revealed to be Mike Hammer * Sol Weinstein wrote four novels about Israel Bond, Agent Oy- Oy-Seven, beginning in 1965: Loxfinger; Matzohball; In the Secret Service of His Majesty ‚Äì the Queen; and You Only Live Until You Die. As with the Harvard Lampoon volumes mentioned above, the covers of the American editions of the Israel Bond books were also based upon the cover designs Signet Books used for Fleming's Bond novels. * Cyril Connolly wrote the short story \\"Bond Strikes Camp\\", satirising a homosexual relationship between M and Bond. * Between 1965 and 1968, paperback writer William Knoles - sometimes described as \\"the greatest unknown writer of our time\\" - penned 20 novels featuring the character Trevor Anderson, codenamed \\"0008\\", under the pseudonym Clyde Allison. The series is variously described as \\"0008\\" or \\"The Man From SADISTO,\\" and spoofs both Bond and The Man From U.N.C.L.E. among other icons of espionage. The books were published by adult publisher William Hamling, edited by Earl Kemp and featured seventeen \\"cover paintings by Robert Bonfils,\\" many also with \\"hand-lettered titles by Harry Bremner.\\" The series stretches from Our Man From SADISTO (1965) to The Desert Damsels (1968), and also features plots containing spoof characters based on Batman and Modesty Blaise among other heroes.The Life and Death of Clyde Allison (A William Henley Knoles Biography) By Lynn Munroe, originally published at eFanzines.com, Vol. 2, No. 2, April 2002. * Mabel Maney has written two Bond parodies, Kiss the Girls and Make Them Spy and The Girl with the Golden Bouffant. The two parodies are based on the character of Jane Bond, James' lesbian sister, who is called upon to replace her brother when he is incapacitated. * An Agent 00005 appeared in the science fiction epic The Illuminatus! Trilogy by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson, published in the early 1970s. This character, named Fission Chips, is a somewhat dim-witted Englishman working for British Intelligence, taking orders from a superior named \\"W.\\" A fan of Ian Fleming's novels, 00005 has patterned his life after James Bond and is obsessed with an organisation known as \\"B.U.G.G.E.R.\\" (a reference to SPECTRE) which he might have completely fabricated. * Bridge experts Philip and Robert King wrote a collection of bridge game-related short stories titled Your Deal, Mr. Bond; the title story features 007. (This shouldn't be confused with the official Bond novel, No Deals, Mr. Bond by John Gardner.) * Kim Newman's novel Dracula Cha Cha Cha features a vampire agent of the Diogenes Club named \\"Hamish Bond\\". The segments of the novel featuring this character are filled with references to the James Bond novels and films, including chapters titled \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\", \\"From Bavaria with Love\\", \\"Live and Let Die\\" and \\"The Living Daylights\\". Bond's archenemy is a vampiric Blofeld (although there's a twist), and an alteration in his personality, towards the end, portrays the change from Sean Connery to Roger Moore. * Clive Cussler's novel Night Probe! has its hero Dirk Pitt alternately oppose and work with \\"Brian Shaw,\\" a retired British Secret Service agent recalled to duty who had taken a pseudonym for protection from his many enemies. The book makes abundantly clear, explicitly so in the two characters' final conversation, that \\"Shaw\\" is Bond. * The comic book series Planetary has a secret agent character named John Stone who closely resembles Bond, but has some similarities to Nick Fury * One issue of the Sonic the Hedgehog Archie comics featured several references to James Bond in a story entitled \\"The Man from H.E.D.G.E.H.O.G.\\" Among these were: a screen that depicted several of Dr. Robotnik's failed operations, all of which had been thwarted by Sonic the Hedgehog, all named after James Bond movie titles: Moonraker, Dr. No, Thunderball, and Goldfinger; the head of a secret intelligence group known by the alias \\"Who\\"; a crate labeled \\"For Your Eyes Only\\"; and Sonic making use of one of James Bond's humorous quips \\"Shocking ... positively shocking\\". * Bond is parodied as Roger Laser in The Fellowship of the Thing by John Salonia, published by Scarlet Succubus PressScarlet Succubus Press in 2001. Laser is shanghaied by an alien scientist to serve as a spy/commando. * The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: The Black Dossier features a ruthless and sadistic British spy named Jimmy, descended from the League's 19th century go-between Campion Bond. He reappears in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Century as Sir James, a respected figure in the intelligence community being maliciously kept alive by a vengeful M despite suffering from syphilis, emphysema, and cirrhosis. * Dr. No Will See You Now is a short piece by English humourist Alan Coren, featuring a geriatric Bond, still-virginal Moneypenny and nonagenarian 'M'. * Anacleto, agente secreto, Spanish comic by Manuel V√°zquez Gallego. * Simon R. Green wrote the Secret History book series, which involves a Bond-like investigator of Fantasy and SF criminals, including titles like The Man with the Golden Torc and Daemons Are Forever. Television =Television specials and series= *Maxwell reprises the role of Moneypenny in Eon Productions' television special Welcome to Japan, Mr. Bond (1967), which was intended to promote You Only Live Twice and contained a storyline of Moneypenny trying to establish the identity of Bond's bride. *The American television series Get Smart (1965‚Äì70) features Don Adams as the consummate Bond spoof, Maxwell Smart, a self-assured but incompetent bungler (the character was also inspired by Inspector Clouseau as played by Peter Sellers), who got by on a combination of luck and the help of his savvy female counterpart Agent 99, in an ongoing battle with a quasi-Soviet enemy entity known as KAOS, with use of esoteric and often unreliable or useless gadgets such as his shoe phone. The series was adapted as an eponymous 2008 movie. Don Adams also voiced the title character in Inspector Gadget, an animated Get Smart parody television series. =Television episodes and arcs= American Dad!: \\"For Black Eyes Only\\" The series American Dad! made a parody of \\"For Your Eyes Only\\" The character Stan Smith plays as himself, but he acts like James Bond. He marries Sexpun T' Come (Francine) after \\"Tearjerker\\", but Black Villain (Lewis) kills his wife by accident (he was actually going to kill Stan, but misses and shoots Sexpun instead) One year later, Stan hears that Black Villain will do something evil by melting the Arctic with hair dryers, and his boss tells Stan that Tearjerker (Roger) is still alive. He then finds Tearjerker in an underground jail and tells him to partner up with Stan. Tearjerker said that he used to work for Black Villain, but he betrays him. They then go to a market to find Tearjerker's partner (Klaus as a human), but he was killed by a black mysterious woman. Stan finds out that the black woman was Sexpun (a clone that Black Villain created, but makes her black) Tearjerker betrays Stan and works for Black Villain again. Stan tells Sexpun that he is her husband, but she disagrees (Stan gives Sexpun a photo locket of their wedding, but she throws it in a fire). He brings back her memories by sucking his toes (Sexpun did the same before Black Villain kills her) and teams up with Stan to stop Tearjerker and Black Villain. Black Villain then starts the hair dryers to melt the Arctic before Stan and Sexpun appear. The two villains try to stop the two by releasing clones of Tearjerker, but fails (the clones attack each other, then kiss each other before committing suicide). Then a big wave of water appears, but Stan, Sexpun, and Tearjerker escape while Black Villain was left behind and drowns. While they escape, Sexpun asked why they helped Tearjerker escape and kicks him and is stabbed by a pointed shark. Stan and Sexpun make out until his boss called him. He congratulates Stan for his work, even when the half of the world was drowned and sees the two making out. Meanwhile, Tearjerker survives and was to come out of the shark, but a killer whale appears and grabs the shark's tail and drags the both of them when white letters appears on the top of the screen, saying \\"To be continued\\" and \\"Or was it?\\". Saying that it might be Tearjerker's final days. BoJack Horseman: \\"Later\\" In \\"Later\\", a season 1 episode of BoJack Horseman, after publication of his ghost-written memoir, BoJack Horseman is offered a role as the villain of a Bond film titled \\"007 GOLDHOOF\\". BoJack's agent Princess Carolyn informs BoJack of the offer, which he declines. MADtv: \\"For Your Files Only\\" Jane Bond is the name of a fictional spy played by supermodel Claudia Schiffer in the first season of MADtv. In an obvious spoof of James Bond (For Your Eyes Only), Jane Bond went undercover as a temporary office secretary in order to stop an evil corporation (led by Dr. Boss, played by Mary Scheer and her office manager, Part-Time Job, played by Artie Lange) from taking over the world. Instead of having a licence to kill like James Bond, Jane Bond has a licence to collate. Immediately after making her famous introduction, \\"[My/The name is] Bond, Jane Bond\\" to Dr. Boss, Bond proceeds to remove the clip that was holding her hair up (and then shaking it out in a prolonged slow motion shot). Jane Bond's gadgets includes standard office supplies like slingshot-like rubber bands (which she uses during a major office shootout), an extremely sharpened right index fingernail (which she uses to free herself from being tied up in rope), Whack Out (which she uses to subdue Part-Time Job, after initially seducing him), and a stapler (which she uses to defeat Dr. Boss, who had plans on killing Bond via a nitroglycerin filled water cooler). After defeating Dr. Boss, Bond proclaims that she likes her villains \\"Stapled, not stirred!\\" Jane Bond's further adventures include: *\\"Octotempy\\" (a parody of Octopussy) *\\"The Man with the Golden Parachute\\" (a parody of The Man with the Golden Gun) *\\"On Her Majesty's Temporary Service\\" (a parody of On Her Majesty's Secret Service) *\\"You Only Temp Twice\\" (a parody of You Only Live Twice) *\\"Moontemper\\" (a parody of Moonraker) *\\"Dr. No-Raise\\" (a parody of Dr. No) *\\"Thunder Ball- Point\\" (a parody of Thunderball) *\\"The Spy Who Hired Me\\" (a parody of The Spy Loved Me) *\\"From Russia with Overtime\\" (a parody of From Russia with Love) *\\"The Living Day Jobs\\" (a parody of The Living Daylights) *\\"License to Type\\" (a parody of Licence to Kill) *\\"Tempfinger\\" (a parody of Goldfinger) Sabrina: The Animated Series: \\"La Femme Sabrina\\" In an episode of the 1999 animated adaption of Sabrina the Teenage Witch, \\"La Femme Sabrina\\", the video release of Harvey Kinkle's favorite spy film, \\"On Her Majesty's Expense Account\\" (a parody of On Her Majesty's Secret Service) was postponed. So Sabrina uses magic to get him a copy of the spy film that he wanted, but backfired the world into an actual spy flick. The episode parodies numerous James Bond references including the gun barrel sequence, Furfinger portrayed by Salem Saberhagen (a parody of Goldfinger), and numerous James Bond film titles including: *\\"On Her Majesty's Expense Account\\" (a parody of On Her Majesty's Secret Service) *\\"From East Bayonne with Love\\" (a parody of From Russia with Love) *\\"Dr. Indecisive\\" (a parody of Dr. No) *\\"The Spy Who Sorta Had A Crush On Me\\" (a parody of The Spy Who Loved Me) *\\"Thundernuggets\\" (a parody of Thunderball) SpongeBob SquarePants: \\"Spy Buddies\\" The SpongeBob SquarePants episode \\"Spy Buddies\\" has a parody. When SpongeBob is told that Mr. Krabs wants him to spy on Plankton, SpongeBob gets excited and a scene similar to the James Bond gun barrel sequence starts. SpongeBob walks into the circle, only to find that the circle is Patrick looking through a straw. The Backyardigans: \\"International Super Spy\\" The Backyardigans double-length episode \\"International Super Spy\\" portrays Pablo as a parody of James Bond. He wears a tuxedo in the episode and is seen adjusting his bow tie frequently. He goes through the episode trying to recover the 3 Silver Containers before the Lady In Pink (Uniqua) and her henchman (Tyrone) does. Tasha plays the head of the International Super Spy Agency, an obvious parody of M and Austin plays his secret contact throughout the film. Austin may be a parody of Q because he gives Pablo a video phone disguised as a banana split, a cell phone disguised as a hot dog, an astral projection device that is disguised as a snow cone, and finally he gives him a jet pack disguised as a pizza and a pizza shaped parachute. He also has a car with many different flying attachments (like a jet, helicopter and a glider). Like the real James Bond, Pablo is able to withstand torture when he is subjected to the Lady in Pink's tickle table and he likes his apple juice, \\"Shaken Not Stirred\\". The Office: \\"Threat Level Midnight\\" An episode of The Office, \\"Threat Level Midnight\\", is a film made by Michael Scott with him as Michael Scarn, the best secret agent in the business, and Jim Halpert as Goldenface, a spoof of Goldfinger. The Simpsons: \\"You Only Move Twice\\" An episode of The Simpsons, \\"You Only Move Twice\\", features the supervillain, Hank Scorpio. The James Bond analogue, \\"Mr. Bont\\", is based on Sean Connery's portrayal but he is captured and killed because Homer Simpson interferes with his attempted escape from captivity. The final scene at Globex contains references to several James Bond films. The episode title and many references are from You Only Live Twice, with A View to a Kill also being referenced.Martyn, Warren; Wood, Adrian (2000). You Only Move Twice. BBC. Retrieved on 27 March 2007. A character modeled after Sean Connery's Bond is tackled by Homer and killed after a parody of the laser scene from Goldfinger.Weinstein, Josh. (2006). The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode \\"You Only Move Twice\\" [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Mrs. Goodthighs from the 1967 James Bond spoof Casino Royale makes an appearance in the episode and a character based on Norman Schwarzkopf is attacked by Goodthighs. The incident is also a reference to the character Xenia Onatopp, from GoldenEye, who specialises in crushing men between her thighs.Anderson, Mike B.. (2006). The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode \\"You Only Move Twice\\" [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The song at the end of the show, written by Ken Keeler, is a parody of various Bond themes. Keeler originally wrote it to be three seconds longer and sound more like the Goldfinger theme, but the final version was shorter and the lyrics were sped up. The writers wanted the song to be sung by Shirley Bassey, who sang several Bond themes, but they could not get her to record the part. This is not the only James Bond homage in The Simpsons, however‚Äîthe \\"Chief Wiggum P.I.\\" segment of \\"The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase\\" episode borrows heavily from Live and Let Die, even duplicating certain shots. Also, in an alleged \\"deleted scene\\" from \\"$pringfield\\" from \\"The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular\\" clip show, Homer, working as a blackjack dealer, causes James Bond to lose to Blofeld, with Oddjob and Jaws as his henchmen, when Homer fails to take out the Joker card and a card for the \\"Rules for Draw and Stud Poker\\" out of a playing deck. In addition, an opening couch gag features Homer as Bond in the gun barrel sequence that opens the Bond films. The character Rainier Wolfcastle, an action movie actor, also regularly references Bond. Also, one Halloween episode featured a computer run house with a selection of actor voices. When Bart suggests some 007, Marge asks \\"George Lazenby?\\" only to get slightly disappointed when Lisa says \\"No, Pierce Brosnan.\\"  Adventures of Captain Wrongel  The Agent 00X is a comic version of Bond, he almost catches criminals in each episode, but at the last monent he fails, which is usually ended by his cruel death. Of course, he will be resurrected at the start of next episode. Video games * The Command & Conquer: Red Alert series features a Spy unit for the Allies, depicted in a tuxedo and sounding similar to Sean Connery. In-game he is unarmed, can disguise himself as enemy soldiers, and sneak past any base defence undetected, only vulnerable to attack dogs or psi corps troopers. The Spy unit can infiltrate buildings to shut off power, disable unit production and radar, or steal resources - the second game allows the unit to capture plans for enemy unique units like the Chrono (crazy) Ivan or Psychic Commando, while the third game introduces the ability to bribe enemy units into joining the Spy unit's side. * The computer game Evil Genius is played from the perspective of a stereotypical 1960s \\"Bond villain\\" type of character, as the player builds a trap-filled base, trains minions, hires elite henchmen, and fights off agents from various world intelligence agencies. The most difficult of the agents to defeat is the British agent John Steele, based on Bond. * In the expansion pack to Grand Theft Auto, Grand Theft Auto: London 1969, there is a car called the 'James Bomb' which looks strangely like an Aston Martin. In the later GTA game, Grand Theft Auto V, Franklin Clinton is made to steal a car from the movie studio where it is being used as a prop in an action film. The car, called the JB 700, bears a strong likeness to the Aston Martin in Goldfinger, and shares a number of hidden features with that car, some usable while others are only referred to, such as two forward-facing machine guns, an ejector seat, a metal shield to protect the rear windscreen and deployable caltrops. * The James Pond series of games parody Bond movies. Levels in a James Pond game use such titles as A View to a Spill and Leak and Let Die. * In Metal Gear Solid, on the third playthrough of a saved file, Solid Snake wears a James Bond-style tuxedo. * In Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, the character Major Zero is a fan of James Bond as revealed during a codec conversation. The protagonist, Naked Snake, also chides James Bond as not being a real spy, ironically a meta-reference to the many similarities he has with Bond. The title theme, Snake Eater, is also a play on the jazzy pop title tracks from Bond movies‚Äîconstantly describing nuances in the story and repeating the movie title over and over. Also before the title theme the Virtuous Mission may be considered a play on the pre-title sequences of the Bond series. * No One Lives Forever (released in 2000) and its sequel, No One Lives Forever: A Spy In H.A.R.M.'s Way (2002), by Monolith Productions combine elements of James Bond (including Goldeneye 007 and Perfect Dark), feature a female secret agent, Cate Archer, take place during the 1960s, and are similarly titled to John Gardner's Bond novel, Nobody Lives For Ever. * In Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, a senior US Army Green Beret officer named James Gastovski introduces himself to the game's protagonist 1LT Dave Armstrong in a James Bond-like tone (\\"Gastovski, James Gastovski\\"). * Operation Thunderbowel (released in 1988) by Sacred Scroll Software is a text based adventure game featuring Shamus Bond going up against Blobum who is attempting to poison the UN with a powerful laxative.Operation Thunderbowel Release information * In Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc, the Wanna Kick Rayman Lesson n¬∞73 features a Hoodmonger Private First Class who dons a tuxedo and holds up a handgun in a characteristic 007 pose, before producing an enormous, laser-firing satellite dish-like device out of his arm. * One of the trailers for Rayman Raving Rabbids TV Party features a rabbid dressed in a tuxedo singing the James Bond theme in a gun barrel sequence. While singing, he notices the barrel, to which he looks into it and starts singing the rest of the theme into it, only to have a carrot shoot out from the barrel into his mouth. * Apogee's 1992 series of jump and run games, Secret Agent, is about Agent tasked with infiltrating the Blofeld-esque hideouts of supervillains directly parodies the James Bond franchise in the setup of its storyline. * Spy Fox parodies Professor Q, Money Penny, and his villains * Spy Muppets: License to Croak is a video game featuring Muppet characters directly spoofing James Bond characters, plots and titles. * Some Stuntman missions require players to race through the streets of Monaco, for the film Live Twice for Tomorrow. * Team Fortress 2 includes achievements for the Spy character such as \\"Dr. Nooooo\\", \\"For Your Eyes Only\\", \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Surface\\", \\"The Man with the Broken Guns\\" and \\"You Only Shiv Thrice\\".

He served as a Progressive Conservative member of the House of Commons of Canada from 1957 to 1968, and as a Progressive Conservative member of the Manitoba Legislature from 1969 to 1981. From 1977 to 1981, he was a cabinet minister in the provincial government of Sterling Lyon. Early life Born in Canora, Saskatchewan, the son of George Jorgenson and Hilma Naslund, Jorgenson attended school at Ste-Elizabeth, Manitoba and Dominion City, Manitoba before becoming a farmer at Ste-Elizabeth. Jorgenson served overseas with the Canadian Army from 1940 to 1946, and worked as a farmer on returning to Canada. He also served as President of the Riverview Golf and Country Club, and was an Honorary President of the Valley Agricultural Society. Federal politics He was first elected to the House of Commons in the general election of 1957, defeating longtime Liberal MP Rene Jutras by 250 votes in the southeastern Manitoba riding of Provencher. In the election of 1958, he was re-elected by a greater margin over Liberal Rene Prefontaine. He was not called to join John Diefenbaker's cabinet, but became parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Agriculture in 1960. Jorgenson was re-elected in the election of 1962 and the election of 1963, defeating Liberal Stan Roberts on both occasions. In the 1965 election, he defeated Liberal Gordon Barkman by about 1,000 votes. He was defeated in the 1968 election by Mark Smerchanski, a leading organizer in the provincial Liberal party. Provincial politics Jorgenson then shifted to provincial politics, and was easily elected for the rural riding of Morris in the 1969 by-election. He did not serve in the cabinet of Walter Weir. He was easily re-elected in the provincial election of 1969, despite the Tories losing power to the NDP. Jorgenson was again re-elected without difficulty in the election of 1973 and the election of 1977. The Tories regained power under Sterling Lyon on the latter occasion, and Jorgenson was called into cabinet on 24 October 1977 as government House Leader and Minister without Portfolio. On 20 October 1978, he was promoted to Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs with responsibility for the Rent Stabilization Board and the Office of Superintendent for Insurance. Following a cabinet shuffle on 16 January 1981, he was named Minister of Government Services with responsibility for the Manitoba Public Insurance Corporation.

This includes identifying, classifying, storing, securing, retrieving, tracking and destroying or permanently preserving records. The ISO 15489-1: 2001 standard (\\"ISO 15489-1:2001\\") defines records management as \\"[the] field of management responsible for the efficient and systematic control of the creation, receipt, maintenance, use and disposition of records, including the processes for capturing and maintaining evidence of and information about business activities and transactions in the form of records\\". An organization's records preserve aspects of institutional memory. In determining how long to retain records, their capacity for re-use is important. Many are kept as evidence of activities, transactions, and decisions. Others document what happened and why. The purpose of records management is part of an organization's broader function of Governance, risk management, and compliance and is primarily concerned with managing the evidence of an organization's activities as well as the reduction or mitigation of risk associated with it. Recent research shows linkages between records management and accountability in governance.David, R. (2017). Contribution of records management to audit opinions and accountability in government. South African Journal of Information Management, 19(1), 1-14.https://doi.org/10.4102/sajim.v19i1.771 Concepts of record The concept of record is variously defined. The ISO 15489-1:2016 defines records as \\"information created, received, and maintained as evidence and as an asset by an organization or person, in pursuit of legal obligations or in the transaction of business\\". While there are many purposes of and benefits to records management, as this definition highlights, a key feature of records is their ability to serve as evidence of an event. Proper records management can help preserve this feature of records. Recent and comprehensive studies have defined records as \\"persistent representations of activities\\" as recorded or created by participants or observers. This transactional view emphasizes the importance of context and process in the determination and meaning of records. In contrast, previous definitions have emphasized the evidential and informational properties of records. In organizational contexts, records are materials created or received by an organization in the transaction of business, or in pursuit of or in compliance with legal obligations. This organizational definition of record stems from the early theorization of archives as organic aggregations of records, that is \\"the written documents, drawings and printed matter, officially received or produced by an administrative body or one of its officials\\". Key records management terminology Not all documents are records. A record is a document consciously retained as evidence of an action. Records management systems generally distinguish between records and non-records (convenience copies, rough drafts, duplicates), which do not need formal management. Many systems, especially for electronic records, require documents to be formally declared as a record so they can be managed. Once declared, a record cannot be changed and can only be disposed of within the rules of the system. Records may be covered by access controls to regulate who can access them and under what circumstances. Physical controls may be used to keep confidential records secure ‚Äì personnel files, for instance, which hold sensitive personal data, may be held in a locked cabinet with a control log to track access. Digital records systems may include role-based access controls, allowing permissions (to view, change and/or delete) to be allocated to staff depending on their role in the organisation. An audit trail showing all access and changes can be maintained to ensure the integrity of the records. Just as the records of the organization come in a variety of formats, the storage of records can vary throughout the organization. File maintenance may be carried out by the owner, designee, a records repository, or clerk. Records may be managed in a centralized location, such as a records center or repository, or the control of records may be decentralized across various departments and locations within the entity. Records may be formally and discretely identified by coding and housed in folders specifically designed for optimum protection and storage capacity, or they may be casually identified and filed with no apparent indexing. Organizations that manage records casually find it difficult to access and retrieve information when needed. The inefficiency of filing maintenance and storage systems can prove to be costly in terms of wasted space and resources expended searching for records. An inactive record is a record that is no longer needed to conduct current business but is being preserved until it meets the end of its retention period, such as when a project ends, a product line is retired, or the end of a fiscal reporting period is reached. These records may hold business, legal, fiscal, or historical value for the entity in the future and, therefore, are required to be maintained for a short or permanent duration. Records are managed according to the retention schedule. Once the life of a record has been satisfied according to its predetermined period and there are no legal holds pending, it is authorized for final disposition, which may include destruction, transfer, or permanent preservation. A disaster recovery plan is a written and approved course of action to take after a disaster strikes that details how an organization will restore critical business functions and reclaim damaged or threatened records. An active record is a record needed to perform current operations, subject to frequent use, and usually located near the user. In the past, 'records management' was sometimes used to refer only to the management of records which were no longer in everyday use but still needed to be kept ‚Äì \\"semi-current\\" or \\"inactive\\" records, often stored in basements or offsite. More modern usage tends to refer to the entire \\"lifecycle\\" of records ‚Äì from the point of creation right through until their eventual disposal. The format and media of records is generally irrelevant for the purposes of records management from the perspective that records must be identified and managed, regardless of their form. The ISO considers management of both physical and electronic records. Also, section DL1.105 of the United States Department of Defense standard DoD 5015.02-STD (2007) defines Records Management as \\"the planning, controlling, directing, organizing, training, promoting, and other managerial activities involving the life cycle of information, including creation, maintenance (use, storage, retrieval), and disposal, regardless of media\\".  Records management theory  = Records life-cycle = The records life-cycle consists of discrete phases covering the life span of a record from its creation to its final disposition. In the creation phase, records growth is expounded by modern electronic systems. Records will continue to be created and captured by the organization at an explosive rate as it conducts the business of the organization. Correspondence regarding a product failure is written for internal leadership, financial statements and reports are generated for public and regulatory scrutiny, the old corporate logo is retired, and a new one ‚Äì including color scheme and approved corporate font ‚Äì takes its place in the organization's history. Examples of records phases include those for creation of a record, modification of a record, movement of a record through its different states while in existence, and destruction of a record. Throughout the records life cycle, issues such as security, privacy, disaster recovery, emerging technologies, and mergers are addressed by the records and information management professional responsible for organizational programs. Records and information management professionals are instrumental in controlling and safeguarding the information assets of the entity. They understand how to manage the creation, access, distribution, storage, and disposition of records and information in an efficient and cost-effective manner using records and information management methodology, principles, and best practices in compliance with records and information laws and regulations. = Records continuum theory = The records continuum theory is an abstract conceptual model that helps to understand and explore recordkeeping activities in relation to multiple contexts over space and time. Records management practices and concepts A records manager is someone who is responsible for records management in an organization. Section 4 of the ISO 15489-1:2001 states that records management includes: * setting policies and standards * assigning responsibilities and authorities * establishing and promulgating procedures and guidelines * providing a range of services relating to the management and use of records * designing, implementing and administering specialized systems for managing records * integrating records management into business systems and processes Thus, the practice of records management may involve: * planning the information needs of an organization * identifying information requiring capture * creating, approving, and enforcing policies and practices regarding records, including their organization and disposal * developing a records storage plan, which includes the short and long-term housing of physical records and digital information * identifying, classifying, and storing records * coordinating access to records internally and outside of the organization, balancing the requirements of business confidentiality, data privacy, and public access. * identification and maintenance of records per a specified retention period * executing a retention policy on the disposal of records which are no longer required for operational reasons; according to organizational policies, statutory requirements, and other regulations this may involve either their destruction or permanent preservation in an archive. Records-management principles and automated records-management systems aid in the capture, classification, and ongoing management of records throughout their lifecycle. ARMA International defines records management as \\"the field of management responsible for establishing and implementing policies, systems, and procedures to capture, create, access, distribute, use, store, secure, retrieve, and ensure disposition of an organization's records and information\\". Such a system may be paper-based (such as index cards as used in a library), or may involve a computer system, such as an electronic records-management application. = Defensible solutions = A defensible solution is one that can be supported with clearly documented policies, processes and procedures that drive how and why work is performed, as well as one that has clearly documented proof of behavior patterns, proving that an organization follows such documented constraints to the best of their ability. While defensibility applies to all aspects of records life cycle, it is considered most important in the context of records destruction, where it is known as \\"defensible disposition\\" or \\"defensible destruction,\\" and helps an organization explicitly justify and prove things like who destroys records, why they destroy them, how they destroy them, when they destroy them, and where they destroy them. = Classification = Records managers use classification or categorization of record types as a means of working with records. Such classifications assist in functions such as creation, organization, storage, retrieval, movement, and destruction of records. At the highest level of classification are physical versus electronic records. (This is disputable; records are defined as such regardless of media. ISO 15489 and other best practices promulgate a functions based, rather than media based classification, because the law defines records as certain kinds of information regardless of media.) Physical records are those records, such as paper, that can be touched and which take up physical space. Electronic records, also often referred to as digital records, are those records that are generated with and used by information technology devices. Classification of records is achieved through the design, maintenance, and application of taxonomies, which allow records managers to perform functions such as the categorization, tagging, segmenting, or grouping of records according to various traits.  Enterprise records  Enterprise records represent those records that are common to most enterprises, regardless of their function, purpose, or sector. Such records often revolve around the day-to-day operations of an enterprise and cover areas such as but not limited litigation, employee management, consultant or contractor management, customer engagements, purchases, sales, and contracts. The types of enterprises that produce and work with such records include but are not limited to for-profit companies, non-profit companies, and government agencies.  Industry records  Industry records represent those records that are common and apply only to a specific industry or set of industries. Examples include but are not limited to medical industry records (e.g., the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), pharmaceutical industry records, and food industry records.  Legal hold records  Legal hold records are those records that are mandated, usually by legal counsel or compliance personnel, to be held for a period of time, either by a government or by an enterprise, and for the purposes of addressing potential issues associated with compliance audits and litigation. Such records are assigned Legal Hold traits that are in addition to classifications which are as a result of enterprise or industry classifications. Legal hold data traits may include but are not limited to things such as legal hold flags (e.g. Legal Hold = True or False), the organization driving the legal hold, descriptions of why records must be legally held, what period of time records must be held for, and the hold location. = Records retention schedule = A records retention schedule is a document, often developed using archival appraisal concepts and analysis of business and legal contexts within the intended jurisdictions, that outlines how long certain types of records need to be retained for before they can be destroyed. Managing physical records Managing physical records involves different disciplines or capabilities and may draw on a variety of forms of expertise. ; Identifying records : If an item is presented as a legal record, it needs to be authenticated. Forensic experts may need to examine a document or artifact to determine that it is not a forgery, and that any damage, alteration, or missing content is documented. In extreme cases, items may be subjected to a microscope, x-ray, radiocarbon dating or chemical analysis. This level of authentication is rare, but requires that special care be taken in the creation and retention of the records of an organization. ; Storing records : Records must be stored in such a way that they are accessible and safeguarded against environmental damage. A typical paper document may be stored in a filing cabinet in an office. However, some organisations employ file rooms with specialized environmental controls including temperature and humidity. Vital records may need to be stored in a disaster-resistant safe or vault to protect against fire, flood, earthquakes and conflict. In extreme cases, the item may require both disaster-proofing and public access, such as the original, signed US Constitution. Civil engineers may need to be consulted to determine that the file room can effectively withstand the weight of shelves and file cabinets filled with paper; historically, some military vessels were designed to take into account the weight of their operating procedures on paper as part of their ballast equation (modern record-keeping technologies have transferred much of that information to electronic storage). In addition to on-site storage of records, many organizations operate their own off-site records centers or contract with commercial records centres. ; Retrieval of records : In addition to being able to store records, enterprises must also establish the proper capabilities for retrieval of records, in the event they are needed for a purpose such as an audit or litigation, or for the case of destruction. Record retrieval capabilities become complex when dealing with electronic records, especially when they have not been adequately tagged or classified for discovery. ; Circulating records : Tracking the record while it is away from the normal storage area is referred to as circulation. Often this is handled by simple written recording procedures. However, many modern records environments use a computerized system involving bar code scanners, or radio- frequency identification technology (RFID) to track movement of the records. These can also be used for periodic auditing to identify unauthorized movement of the record. ; Disposal of records : Disposal of records does not always mean destruction. It can also include transfer to a historical archive, museum, or private individual. Destruction of records ought to be authorized by law, statute, regulation, or operating procedure, and the records should be disposed of with care to avoid inadvertent disclosure of information. The process needs to be well-documented, starting with a records retention schedule and policies and procedures that have been approved at the highest level. An inventory of the records disposed of should be maintained, including certification that they have been destroyed. Records should never simply be discarded as refuse. Most organizations use processes including pulverization, paper shredding or incineration. Commercially available products can manage records through all processes active, inactive, archival, retention scheduling and disposal. Some also utilize RFID technology for the tracking of the physical file.  Managing digital records  The general principles of records management apply to records in any format. Digital records, however, raise specific issues. It is more difficult to ensure that the content, context and structure of records is preserved and protected when the records do not have a physical existence. This has important implications for the authenticity, reliability, and trustworthiness of records. Much research is being conducted on the management of digital records. The International Research on Permanent Authentic Records in Electronic Systems (InterPARES) Project is one example of such an initiative. Based at the School of Library, Archival and Information Studies at the University of British Columbia, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, the InterPARES Project is a collaborative project between researchers all across the world committed to developing theories and methodologies to ensure the reliability, accuracy, and authenticity of digital records. Functional requirements for computer systems to manage digital records have been produced by the US Department of Defense, The United Kingdom's National Archives and the European Commission, whose MoReq (Model Requirements for the Management of Electronic Records) specification has been translated into at least twelve languages funded by the European Commission. Particular concerns exist about the ability to access and read digital records over time, since the rapid pace of change in technology can make the software used to create the records obsolete, leaving the records unreadable. A considerable amount of research is being undertaken to address this, under the heading of digital preservation. The Public Record Office Victoria (PROV) located in Melbourne, Australia published the Victorian Electronic Records Strategy (VERS) which includes a standard for the preservation, long-term storage and access to permanent electronic records. The VERS standard has been adopted by all Victorian Government departments. A digital archive has been established by PROV to enable the general public to access permanent records. Archives New Zealand is also setting up a digital archive. ;Electronic tax records Electronic Tax Records are computer- based/non-paper versions of records required by tax agencies like the Internal Revenue Service. There is substantial confusion about what constitutes acceptable digital records for the IRS, as the concept is relatively new. The subject is discussed in Publication 583 and Bulletin 1997-13, but not in specific detail. Businesses and individuals wishing to convert their paper records into scanned copies may be at risk if they do so. For example, it is unclear if an IRS auditor would accept a JPEG, PNG, or PDF format scanned copy of a purchase receipt for a deducted expense item. Current issues ; Compliance and legal issues While public administration, healthcare and the legal profession have a long history of records management, the corporate sector has generally shown less interest. This has changed in recent years due to new compliance requirements, driven in part by scandals such as the Enron/Andersen affair and more recent problems at Morgan Stanley. Corporate records compliance issues including retention period requirements and the need to disclose information as a result of litigation have come to be seen as important. Statutes such as the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act have resulted in greater standardization of records management practices. Since the 1990s the shift towards electronic records has seen a need for close working relations between records managers and IT managers, particularly including the legal aspects, focused on compliance and risk management. ; Security Privacy, data protection, and identity theft have become issues of increasing interest. The role of the records manager in the protection of an organization's records has grown as a result. The need to ensure personal information is not retained unnecessarily has brought greater focus to retention schedules and records disposal. ;Transparency The increased importance of transparency and accountability in public administration, marked by the widespread adoption of Freedom of Information laws, has led to a focus on the need to manage records so that they can be easily accessed by the public. For instance, in the United Kingdom, Section 46 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 required the government to publish a Code of Practice on Records Management for public authorities. Similarly, European Union legislation on Data Protection and Environmental Information, requiring organisations to disclose information on request, create a need for effective management of such records. ; Adoption and implementation Implementing required changes to organisational culture is a major challenge, since records management is often seen as an unnecessary or low priority administrative task that can be performed at the lowest levels within an organization. Reputational damage caused by poor records management has demonstrated that records management is the responsibility of all individuals within an organization. An issue that has been very controversial among records managers has been the uncritical adoption of Electronic document and records management systems. ; Impact of internet and social media Another issue of great interest to records managers is the impact of the internet and related social media, such as wikis, blogs, forums, and companies such as Facebook and Twitter, on traditional records management practices, principles, and concepts, since many of these tools allow rapid creation and dissemination of records and, often, even in anonymous form. ; Records life cycle management A difficult challenge for many enterprises is tied to the tracking of records through their entire information life cycle so that it's clear, at all times, where a record exists or if it still exists at all. The tracking of records through their life cycles allows records management staff to understand when and how to apply records related rules, such as rules for legal hold or destruction. ; Conversion of paper records to electronic form As the world becomes more digital in nature, an ever-growing issue for the records management community is the conversion of existing or incoming paper records to electronic form. Such conversions are most often performed with the intent of saving storage costs, storage space, and in hopes of reducing records retrieval time. Tools such as document scanners, optical character recognition software, and electronic document management systems are used to facilitate such conversions. Education and certification Many colleges and universities offer degree programs in library and information sciences which cover records management. Furthermore, there are professional organizations which provide a separate, non-degreed, professional certification for practitioners, the Certified Records Manager designation or CRM. Electronic records management systems An Electronic Document and Records Management System is a computer program or set of programs used to track and store records. The term is distinguished from imaging and document management systems that specialize in paper capture and document management respectively. Electronic records management Systems commonly provide specialized security and auditing functionality tailored to the needs of records managers. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has endorsed the U.S. Department of Defense standard 5015.2 as an \\"adequate and appropriate basis for addressing the basic challenges of managing records in the automated environment that increasingly characterizes the creation and use of records\\".https://www.archives.gov/records_management/policy_and_guidance/automated_recordkeeping_requirements.html Records Management Vendors can be certified as compliant with the DoD 5015.2-STD after verification from the Joint Interoperability Test Command which builds test case procedures, writes detailed and summary final reports on 5015.2-certified products, and performs on-site inspection of software.http://jitc.fhu.disa.mil/recmgt/register.html The National Archives in the UK has published two sets of functional requirements to promote the development of the electronic records management software market (1999 and 2002).http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/electronicrecords/function.htm It ran a program to evaluate products against the 2002 requirements. While these requirements were initially formulated in collaboration with central government, they have been taken up with enthusiasm by many parts of the wider public sector in the UK and in other parts of the world. The testing program has now closed; The National Archives is no longer accepting applications for testing. The National Archives 2002 requirements remain current. The European Commission has published \\"MoReq\\", the Model Requirements for Electronic Records and Document Management in 2001.http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/en/document/2303/5644 Although not a formal standard, it is widely regarded and referred to as a standard.http://www.eneclann.ie/Records_Management/legislation_standards.html Negotiating the RM standards maze (in French) This was funded by the Commission's IDA program, and was developed at the instigation of the DLM Forum. A major update of MoReq, known as MoReq2, was published in February 2008. This too was initiated by the DLM Forum and funded by the European Commission, on this occasion by its IDABC program (the successor to IDA). A software testing framework and an XML schema accompany MoReq2; a software compliance testing regime was agreed at the DLM Forum conference in Toulouse in December 2008. The National Archives of Australia (NAA) published the Functional Specifications for Electronic Records Management Systems Software (ERMS), and the associated Guidelines for Implementing the Functional Specifications for Electronic Records Management Systems Software, as exposure drafts in February 2006. Archives New Zealand published a 'discretionary best practice' Electronic Recordkeeping Systems Standard (Standard 5) in June 2005, issued under the authority of Section 27 of the Public Records Act 2005.Public Records Act 2005 =Commercial records centers= Commercial records centers are facilities which provide services for the storage for paper records for organizations. In some cases, they also offer storage for records maintained in electronic formats. Commercial records centers provide high density storage for paper records and some offer climate controlled storage for sensitive non- paper and critical (vital) paper media. There is a trade organization for commercial records centers (for example, PRISM International), however, not all service providers are members.

She was killed, along with five other SLA members, in a nationally televised shootout with the Los Angeles Police Department. Background Angela DeAngelis grew up in the small New Jersey suburb of North Haledon near Paterson. The daughter of a local Teamsters official, DeAngelis was active in many student leadership groups and was captain of the cheerleading squad. She starred in many school musicals and quietly tutored and befriended classmates others ignored. She was voted Most School Spirit by her peers while attending Manchester Regional High School. At Indiana University Bloomington, she met leftwing activist, theatre student and future husband Gary Atwood. While at school she sang in the Kappa Pickers (a musical group in the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority) with Jane Pauley, was involved in theater, and majored in education. She helped fellow theater student Kevin Kline organize and run a guerrilla theatre group in town. She married Atwood while still an undergraduate, and they befriended William Harris, another Indiana University actor, and his wife Emily. She graduated in 1970 and began student teaching in Indianapolis. Symbionese Liberation Army The Atwoods moved to San Francisco, where Angela became friends with Kathleen Soliah (now known as Sara Jane Olson). The two women acted together in a local production of Henrik Ibsen's Hedda Gabler and Angela got Kathy a job waiting tables. They quit the job together when the manager told them to wear revealing outfits to build up the lunch crowd. Angela and Gary Atwood separated in June 1973. She moved in with the Harrises in early December 1973. She then joined the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) along with the Harrises. Atwood was described as well dressed, with a preference for hippie attire, particularly Indian silk shirts and batik. Atwood liked such feminine accessories as earrings, jewelry, and rings. A friend described her as \\"the prima donna of the whole thing\\", and likened her to the woman depicted by Bob Dylan in \\"Just Like A Woman\\". Atwood (speaking as \\"Gelina\\") was often the voice of the SLA, in the form of tape-recorded press releases. In Patty Hearst's account of her time with the SLA, she writes that Gelina would spend hours, and sometimes days, perfecting communiques. SLA members held an anti-bourgeois ideology of popular rule partly based on the idea that the most oppressed members of society, often blacks, must be the ones to lead a revolution against The Establishment. Hearst testified that Atwood, William Harris, and Nancy Ling Perry were given to bemoaning their white skin and wishing they were black. According to Hearst's testimony, SLA members also envied persons like their black leader Field Marshal Cinque (pronounced sin-q) (Donald DeFreeze), who had served time in prison.The Many Trials of Patty Hearst, Los Angeles Times, 27 February 1976, pg. OC_C1. This partly explained their allegiance to Cinque. Atwood, however, many times disagreed with his directives, as when she argued against his issuing a death warrant for two imprisoned SLA members. Atwood was assigned the task of surveillance in the potential kidnapping of John E. Countryman, former chairman of the board of Del Monte Corporation. The surveillance plan gave Countryman's age as 70. Atwood was apparently unaware that Countryman had died in July 1972 at the age of 69. Atwood used the name Anne Lindberg when she visited inmate James Harold (\\"Doc\\") Holiday on January 10, 1974. This encounter alerted Holiday to the capture of Remiro and Russ Little, who were both linked through strong circumstantial evidence to the murder of Marcus Foster, Superintendent of the Oakland Unified School District in Oakland, California. They were arrested following a shootout with policemen in Concord, California. Quickly after Atwood's approach of Holiday, she fled the Oakland, California home with the Harrises. They left behind clothes, a stereo, personal papers, and three pistol boxes. Prominent role in Hearst kidnapping In her trial for armed robbery, Patty Hearst testified that she was kidnapped from her Berkeley, California apartment by Atwood, Donald DeFreeze, and William Harris, on the night of February 4, 1974. Hearst's insistence that she was forced by the SLA to make a series of self- incriminating statements was supported by Dr. Margaret Thaler-Singer, a UC Berkeley clinical psychologist. As an expert on speech patterns who studied the tapes released by the SLA, Thaler-Singer stated that the speech patterns did not fit the style of Hearst. Rather they resembled the styles of Atwood and Emily Harris.Hearst Defense Rests After Losing Bid For Dismissal, Los Angeles Times, March 2, 1976, pg. B1. Atwood's voice is heard on a taped message of March 9, 1974, used in negotiations with Randolph Hearst for the return of Patty Hearst. Atwood assumed the voice of a black woman and said, \\"The dream - and indeed it is a dream - of [many on the Left] is that the enemy corporate state will willingly give the stolen riches of the earth back to the people and that this will be accomplished through compromising talk and empty words . . . to this, our bullets scream loudly. The enemy's bloodthirsty greed will be destroyed by the growing spirit of the people and their thirst for freedom. We call upon the people to judge for themselves whether our tactics of waging struggle are correct or incorrect in fighting the enemy by any means necessary.\\" Prosecution witness Dr. Joel Fort identified Atwood, Perry, and Willie Wolfe as the SLA members Hearst developed the \\"most affectionate bonds\\" with.Miss Hearst Called 'Queen of SLA', Voluntary Member, Los Angeles Times, March 9, 1976, pg. B1. Death in Los Angeles safehouse shootout Atwood, along with five other founding members of the SLA, including Donald DeFreeze, was killed in Los Angeles on May 17, 1974, in a shootout with police that was broadcast live on television. Atwood died of burns and smoke inhalation when the SLA's safehouse caught fire during the gun battle and burned to the ground. It was Atwood's death that prompted Kathleen Soliah to hold a memorial service for her and the other deceased members of the SLA; Soliah and a few others became part of the \\"second team\\", giving the SLA life for about two more years. Eulogy Atwood was eulogized by the Rev. Joseph Citro, a 25-year-old priest, at her funeral mass in Prospect Park, New Jersey on May 26, 1974. They grew up blocks from each other and knew each other through the local Catholic Youth Organization. In an interview the day after the mass, Citro stated that \\"we must enable these young people to make basic changes in society or more girls like Angela will have to suffer.\\"Andelman, David A. \\"Priest Explains Eulogy of Slain S.L.A.

A follow-up to 1986's Out Run, it was released as a dedicated game, as well as an upgrade kit for the original Out Run board. Like its predecessor, Turbo OutRun has players driving a Ferrari, this time a Ferrari F40. Players now traverse a set route across the entire continental United States from New York City to Los Angeles instead of the branching paths of the first game. In addition to a time limit, Turbo OutRun also adds a computer-controlled opponent driving a Porsche 959. The \\"Turbo\\" in the title also plays a factor as players can now press a button to receive a brief turbo boost of speed. Various power-ups which increase the vehicle's attributes can now be chosen at various stages of the game. Ports of Turbo OutRun were released for home computers as well as Sega's own Mega Drive. Overview In Turbo Outrun the player controls a male driver sitting alongside his girlfriend in a Ferrari F40, racing against the clock and a computer-controlled opponent in a silver Porsche 959 in a race across the United States. The goal is to reach Los Angeles from the starting point of New York City. Unlike the original Out Run, there are no branch roads to choose from. Instead, there is only one path that can be taken to reach the goal. A notable feature of the game is that the player can increase speed by using turbo boost by pressing a button on the side of the console-mounted shifter; the engine temperature will increase in kind on the on-screen gauge. When the gauge reaches \\"OVERHEAT!\\" turbo boost cannot be used until the temperature decreases. Another notable difference is that police cars occasionally appear that try to stop the player. They have to either be outrun by using the turbo boost or destroyed by the player by ramming them off-road and into an object on the side of the road. Unlike the original Out Run, Turbo Out Run offers the player a choice between automatic transmission or two-speed manual transmission. Retrieved 16 January 2016 At every sub-goal (reached after passing through about four cities), a power-up can be chosen, the three being: Hi-Power Engine, Special Turbo, and Super Grip Tires. If the CPU opponent reaches the sub-goal before the player, at the next race, the driver's girlfriend will move to the opponent's car. He can still win the girl back if he beats the CPU opponent to the next sub-goal. If the player beats the opponent with the girl in hand, a 1,000,000 point bonus is given. Also, the girl kisses the driver in front of his CPU opponent. If the player reaches the final checkpoint, in the process, the player will pass the CPU opponent and the ending scene is played. It was available in a stand-up cabinet, and a sit-down cabinet with decals giving it an appearance of a Ferrari F40, the car featured in the game. There were also conversion kits available to convert original Out Run machines to Turbo OutRun. Computer ports of the game were received with varying degrees of enthusiasm. Commodore 64 version was widely seen as a good game but 16-bit conversions got very negative reviews. Stage Order The courses are raced straightforward in 4 sections consisting of 4 stages each with no fork roads. * Stage 1: New York (Start of game) * Stage 2: Washington D.C. * Stage 3: Pittsburgh * Stage 4: Indianapolis (End of section 1) * Stage 5: Chicago (Runs along Route 66) * Stage 6: St. Louis * Stage 7: Memphis * Stage 8: Atlanta (End of section 2) * Stage 9: Miami * Stage 10: New Orleans * Stage 11: San Antonio * Stage 12: Dallas (End of section 3) * Stage 13: Oklahoma City * Stage 14: Denver * Stage 15: Grand Canyon (Runs along Route 66) * Stage 16: Los Angeles (End of game) Aside from the reduction in length (the 9000 km route would take approx 80 hours, the game can be finished in 15 minutes), some of the stages are not accurately portrayed to their real life counterparts. For example: Atlanta is nothing more than a field covered in snow (more resembling Stone Mountain Park) and Dallas looks like the Gobi Desert. Music Unlike the 1986 original game Out Run, the music cannot be selected, rather the games background music play in each section of the game in this order: Japan & US Layout: * Rush a Difficulty (Stages 1‚Äì4) * Keep Your Heart (Stages 5‚Äì8) * Shake the Street (Stages 9‚Äì12) * Who Are You? (Stages 13‚Äì16) European Layout: * Shake the Street (Stages 1‚Äì4) * Rush a Difficulty (Stages 5‚Äì8) * Who Are You? (Stages 9‚Äì12) * Keep Your Heart (Stages 13‚Äì16) In the 1993 arcade game Daytona USA, a song from Turbo Outrun can be played on the name entry screen by entering the initials TOR. The result is the opening couple of bars of \\"Rush A Difficulty\\". = Commodore 64 soundtrack = The Commodore 64 home version soundtrack, composed and arranged by Jeroen Tel, was well received. The soundtrack won the \\"Best music on 8-bit computer 1989\\" award on European Computer Trade Show. The title track is a remix of \\"Magical Sound Shower\\" from Out Run, featuring sound samples from Jeroen Tel himself; due to sampling quality, he was actually saying \\"One, two, tree... hit it, Out Run\\" while recording, instead of \\"three\\", to avoid it sounding like \\"free\\". Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Turbo Outrun on their March 15, 1989 issue as being the third most-successful upright arcade unit of the year. Turbo Outrun received positive to mixed reviews, depending on the version. The arcade and Commodore 64 versions were well received. Commodore User reviewed the arcade version and scored it 8 out of 10. The C64 version was awarded 93% from C+VG and 97% in Zzap!64.See box art for the C64 conversion The Spectrum version of the game received 70% from Your Sinclair, 78% from Sinclair User and 79% from Crash. Mean Machines dismissed the Mega Drive version with an overall rating of 42%. The only aspect of the game to receive genuine praise was the high- scores screen design. The review pointed to \\"hopeless, mega-jerky 3-D graphics, juddery scrolling, dreadful tunes, naff sound effects, and badly drawn sprites\\", and concluded it to be a \\"clapped out Robin Reliant of a race game\\".Mean Machines, Issue 18, March 1992, pp. 78-9 Mega placed the Mega Drive version at #3 in their list of the 10 Worst Mega Drive Games of All Time.Mega magazine issue 1, page 85, Future Publishing, Oct 1992 References External links *Turbo OutRun Review at Mean Machines Mag (refers to the poorly received home port, not the arcade original) *Outrun.org *Route map *C64 Turbo Outrun intro music 1989 video games Amiga games Amstrad CPC games Arcade games Atari ST games Commodore 64 games DOS games FM Towns games ICE Software games OutRun Racing video games Sega-AM2 games Sega arcade games Sega Genesis games Single-player video games U.S. Gold games Video games designed by Yu Suzuki Video games developed in Japan Video games scored by Hiroshi Kawaguchi Video games scored by Jeroen Tel Video games set in New York City Video games set in Washington, D.C.

The New Jersey Midland Railway (NJM) was formed in 1870 as a consolidation of several smaller railroads. The original plan was to cut through the Hudson Palisades near Englewood and run south along the Hudson River to Weehawken, but the company lacked the money to do so, and instead made arrangements to run through the Pennsylvania Railroad's cut from Marion Junction through Bergen Hill in Jersey City to their Exchange Place Terminal. One of the consolidated companies, the New Jersey Western Railroad had built about ten miles of trackage from Hawthorne/Hawthorne (NYS&W; station) to Bloomingdale from 1868 to 1870, including the Wortendyke (NYS&W; station) before it was consolidated into the NJ Midland.\\"THE NEW-JERSEY MIDLAND.; THE STOCKHOLDERS DEMANDING A SHARE UNDER THE REORGANIZATION.\\" New York Times March 11, 1880 In 1871 built west from Two Bridges/Beaver Lake through Sussex County, including construction of the Backwards Tunnel, to the New York state line at Hanford, New Jersey, just south of Unionville, New York. The Ogden Mine Railroad was made obsolete. This was later known as the Hanford Branch. By 1872 the NJ Midland completed the line between Hackensack and Newfoundland. It also built a line through the Ridgefields by 1872, but with no station. It joined the Erie Railroad Northern Branch at Granton Junction near Babbit, and reached the community of New Durham (near the point now under New Jersey Route 495 where the Susquehanna Transfer had later been located). Hudson Connecting Railway The right-of-way of the Hudson Connecting in Jersey City, now part of NYS&W; (at right), runs parallel to the Northern Branch The charter for the NJ Midland prevented it from crossing any other railroad to reach the Hudson River, but a route along the foot of the west side of the Bergen Hill to reach the PRR took it across the Erie Railroad. So a new company with the same management, the Hudson Connecting Railway, was formed to build the final leg. With the intention to reach a terminal on the Hudson River, in 1873 the NJM built the Hudson Connecting ROW which south to West End Junction from New Durham, North Bergen near the point now known as CP 2 at what became North Bergen Yard. (The Susquehanna Transfer. The southernmost part leased from the Erie Railroad's as their original terminus, which had been built as the Paterson and Hudson River Railroad.Mohowski, Robert E., The New York, Susquehanna & Western Railroad, JHU Press, 2003 which accessed Erie's Long Dock Tunnel and Pavonia Terminal. The NJ Midland also served as a terminus for the Montclair Railway, which later became the New York and Greenwood Lake Railway. The lease provide access south to the PRR at Marion Junction. Middletown, Unionville and Water Gap Railroad In 1866, public meetings were held in Middletown Westtown and Unionville, New York to discuss the viability of a railroad via these hamlets to Deckertown, Sussex County, New Jersey. A route was surveyed from there to Middletown, but, as built, the Middletown, Unionville and Water Gap Railroad only extended from a connection with the NY&E; in Middletown to Unionville, which was reached on December 6, 1867, after fourteen months of construction. Freight cars received from the Erie made the trip to Unionville starting January 13, 1868. The MU&WG; was built to the broad gauge of the Erie. The road was leased to the Erie and commenced regular operations as the Erie's \\"Unionville Branch\\" on May 15, 1868. On January 11, 1866, the New York and Oswego Midland Railroad (NY&OM;) was incorporated with the goal of linking Oswego, New York, on Lake Ontario, with the Hudson River at a point across from New York City. The NY&OM; reached Middletown in 1871 and hoped to connect with three New Jersey companies to form a through route to the Port of New York and New Jersey. The link between the NY&OM; and the NJM would be the MU&WG; which was leased by the NY&OM; effective April 1, 1872. The NY&OM; soon entered bankruptcy and dropped the lease on the MU&WG; which was then leased by the NJM in 1873. NYS&W; and the Middletown and New Jersey Railroad use the line with shared trackage rights.http://www.mnjrr.com/images/mnj-map2.pdf Bankruptcy and NYS&W; thumb The NJ Midland went bankrupt and was sold to receivers in March 1875. By December 1878, a dispute broke out between various bondholders, some of whom disputed that the Hudson Connecting Railway should be included in the proceedings.The Midland Railway Suit, The New York Times December 18, 1878 On February 21, 1880, the NJ Midland, along with the Hudson Connecting Railway, was sold to Charles Parsons, who represented the bondholders of the first and second mortgages; the two railroads were combined into one. In June 1881 the NJ Midland was consolidated with five other railroads to form the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway with Frederic A. Potts and Garret Hobart serving as chief officers.*Six Railroads Consolidated, New York Times June 12, 1881 page 5 The company expanded west into Pennsylvania along the Wilkes-Barre and Eastern Railroad. The NYS&W; later shifted its mainline to run along the ROW developed by the Lehigh and Hudson River Railway, designating the NJ Midland portion above Sparta Junction the Hanford Branch. Stations and possible future use Commuter service ended in 1966, but has been considered for restoration as the Passaic‚ÄìBergen Rail Linehttp://www.northjersey.com/opinion/will-commuter-line-return-1.303234 Existing original station buildings from the NJ Midland can be found at Bogota, Maywood, Vreeland Avenue, Wortendyke, Butler, and Newfoundland among other places.

The name of the group comes from the venue of their principal meetings prior to release of their first blueprint; Blueprint for a Living Continent. Program The Wentworth Group has three core objectives: *Driving innovation in the management of Australia's biodiversity, land and water resources; *Engage business, community and political leaders in a dialogue to find and implement solutions to the challenge of environmental stewardship facing the future of Australian society; *Building capacity by mentoring and supporting young scientists, lawyers and economists to develop their skills and understanding of public policy. The Wentworth Group first came together in November 2002. Their first statement, Blueprint for a Living Continent, set out what it believed were the key changes that needed to be made to deliver a sustainable future for our continent and its people. The Group emphasised the need to: *Clarify water property rights and the obligations associated with those rights to give farmers some certainty and to enable water to be recovered for the environment. *Restore environmental flows to stressed rivers, such as the River Murray and its tributaries. *Immediately end broad scale land clearing of remnant native vegetation and assist rural communities with adjustment. This provides fundamental benefits to water quality, prevention of salinity, prevention of soil loss and conservation of biodiversity. *Pay farmers for environmental services (clean water, fresh air, healthy soils). Where we expect farmers to maintain land in a certain way that is above their duty of care, we should pay them to provide those services on behalf of the rest of Australia. *Incorporate into the cost of food, fibre and water the hidden subsidies currently borne by the environment, to assist farmers to farm sustainably and profitably in this country.

It was a selection of Oprah's Book Club in October 1997. Plot introduction The novel follows the story of Ellen, the first person narrator, a young white American girl living under unfavorable conditions somewhere in the rural South. The novel is not written in standard English. It is often grammatically incorrect (a egg sandwich, growed, etc.) and generally tries to render the language of a 9- through 11-year-old girl who, in spite of being clever and ambitious, is relatively uneducated. The novel is most likely set in the late 1970s, due to the fact that Ellen states the following on page 48 when talking about her teacher-\\"She lived in the sixties. She used to be a flower child but now she is low key so she can hold a job.\\" Two time levels are intertwined throughout the book: one presenting Ellen's life from her present point of view, living with her \\"new mama\\"; and the other one telling Ellen's story from her mother's death and leading up to the present. The two time levels are united at the end of the novel, when Ellen is about twelve years old. The reader can follow her life over the course of a bit more than two years. A sequel, The Life All Around Me by Ellen Foster, was published in 2006. In the sequel, Ellen reveals that she lives in the sand hills piedmont region of North Carolina and that Ava Gardner's birthplace (near Smithfield, North Carolina) is down the road from her house. Plot summary Ellen is an only child who does not have a real home, even at the time when both her parents are still alive. Her father is \\"trash\\" and has a drinking problem, and the whole atmosphere is one of domestic violence. Her mother has a heart condition caused by \\"Romantic\\" Rheumatic fever and, when the novel opens, has to stay in the hospital. From an early age on, Ellen's thoughts center on how she could get rid of her father--she imagines killing him one way or another. When her mother is released from hospital Ellen's father treats her as badly as before, and it is up to Ellen to protect her mother from him. Soon, however, she takes an overdose of pills and dies while Ellen is lying next to her. After her mother's premature death, Ellen, who is only eleven years of age, takes charge of the meager household finances. She starts accumulating money, as she realizes she will need money to have a better start later in life. In spite of her unhappy childhood Ellen is a smart girl; she borrows books from the library and is rather creative when it comes to spending her spare time. Her best friend, Starletta, is a young black girl who has poor, but kind parents. She is attracted to them although she has been brought up detesting \\"niggers\\" and although she herself cannot overcome all the racial prejudice that has been inculcated in her mind all her life. Ellen says she would never sleep in a \\"colored house\\". Also, she refuses to eat or drink anything when she is at Starletta's, remembering the myth that if a person uses the same glass or cup as \\"coloreds\\", the germs they have left on it will spread onto their lips and they will turn as dark as they are. On the other hand, her father himself has his \\"colored buddies\\" with whom he drinks. Ellen's odyssey (almost in a picaresque vein) starts the night Ellen's father mistakes her for her mother. *At Starletta's parents': After the first instance of abuse to her (not sexual), Ellen goes to Starletta's house, where she stays for the night. *At Aunt Betsy's: On the following morning, having decided to leave her father for good, she packs all her belongings into a box and goes to Aunt Betsy, who has no children and whose husband has recently died. Betsy treats Ellen well, but she misunderstands Ellen about the permanence of Ellen's stay. Accordingly, when the weekend is over, Betsy turns her out again, and Ellen has to return to her father. *At Julia's: When he starts beating her, her bruises are noticed at school and as a temporary solution, her free spirited art teacher invites Ellen to live with her and her husband, Roy. Ellen accepts, leaving with her few belongings and the money she has saved up over the past few months. Despite not completely understanding Julia and Roy's way of life, Ellen feels loved and happy. During the period of separations, her father tries to get her back by bribing her with money, but fails. *At her grandmother's: Sooner or later the question of custody has to be settled in court. Ellen learns that her grandmother (\\"my mama's mama\\") is going to take care of her. A wealthy woman who can even afford two black household helps, her grandmother turns out to be a grumpy and bitter old woman who does not really love her granddaughter. She is referred to as the \\"bosslady\\" by her workers and she even makes Ellen work in the cotton fields during the summer. She also permanently reproaches Ellen for being her father's daughter and for taking after him, and claims Ellen is responsible for her own daughter's death. Furthermore, she says she knows that Ellen had sex with her father's colored friends (although this is not true). What is more, she suffers from severe mental illness and believes that people around the house, even her doctor, are stealing things from her. When she becomes ill she expects Ellen to nurse her, which Ellen dutifully does up to the time her grandmother dies. *At Aunt Nadine's: Ellen's life does not improve when she is taken up by another of her mother's sisters, her aunt Nadine Nelson, who lives with her daughter Dora. Dora, who is the same age as Ellen, and Nadine are a self- sufficient pair who consider Ellen an intruder. The big quarrel occurs, of all days, on Christmas Day, when Dora gets all kinds of presents (toys mainly) and Ellen receives a single pack of white drawing paper, which she throws at Nadine's feet. Furthermore, Ellen takes a lot of effort to paint a picture for her aunt and her cousin, but she overhears them describing her painting as \\"silly\\" and \\"cheap-looking\\". As an act of revenge, Ellen pretends she has a boyfriend who has given her a microscope for Christmas. Nadine calls her an \\"ungrateful little bitch\\" and tells her she does not want to see her again in her house. *At her new mama's: In church Ellen encounters a nice and friendly woman, who she believes is called Mrs Foster, and her well-behaved children. She carefully plans to get in touch with them, and after her argument with Nadine she just packs her things together and goes to the house of the \\"Foster family\\". In reality, the \\"family\\" is a home for disadvantaged adolescents--a kind of foster family rather than a \\"real\\" family with the surname Foster. Orphaned after her father's death (of an aneurysm), Ellen does not tell us about the formalities she has to go through to be accepted, but the most important thing for her is that for the first time in her life she is given a warm welcome. Throughout the novel, the reader learns how beautiful her new home is. Ellen also overcomes her racial prejudice and is very glad that her new mama allows Starletta to spend the weekend with her at her new home. Characters in Ellen Foster * Ellen Foster is the 10-year-old protagonist of the novel. She suffers physical abuse and psychological abuse from her alcoholic father and after her mother commits suicide, is tossed around from one household to another. Throughout her journey, Ellen is hopeful that she will someday find a nice and loving home, which she eventually does. * Daddy is the novel's antagonist. He abuses his daughter, Ellen, physically, sexually and psychologically. He suffers from alcoholism, and holds no job other than selling liquor and eventually drinks himself to death. * Mama, Ellen's mother, has suffered from poor health, suffering from \\"romantic [rheumatic] fever\\" since childhood. When she is at last at the hospital, she is so severely depressed as a result of her husband's cruelty and her illness that she commits suicide by overdosing on prescription medication. * Starletta is Ellen's black best friend, who helps Ellen to realize that skin color makes no difference in the quality of the person. She lives with her mother and father in a ramshackle cabin with no indoor toilet and they often provide Ellen with refuge from her father. Gradually, Starletta transforms from an unsophisticated child into a mature young woman, and she develops a crush on a white boy from school. * New Mama, Ellen's foster mother, is everything for which Ellen could have hoped. New Mama is kind, caring, nurturing, always has enough money to pay for groceries, and has plenty of love to give Ellen and the other children she fosters. * Mama's Mama, Ellen's grandmother on her mother's side, is old and miserly and treats Ellen with cruelty, as she strongly dislikes Ellen's father and seeks vengeance on him through Ellen. After winning custody of Ellen in court, she immediately sends her to work the fields with the black field hands on the farms she owns in the scorching summer heat. At the end of the summer, she dies of illness, even after Ellen has taken extraordinary good care of her. * Mavis, a kind field worker on Ellen's grandmother's farm, takes Ellen under her wing and teaches her how to row the land and how to stay cool in the unbearable summer heat. She tells Ellen of how she had known her mother as a child and says that Ellen looks very much like her. Mavis has a large, happy family that Ellen admires and wants to emulate. * Nadine, Ellen's aunt on her mother's side, is false and pretentious and lies to herself that she is wealthy and successful to gain confidence. She is forced to take Ellen for a short period of time, though she eventually kicks her out of the house on Christmas Day. She dotes on her daughter Dora and treats Dora like a small child, although she is the same age as Ellen. * Dora, Ellen's cousin and daughter of Nadine, is a sheltered, spoiled brat who gets everything she wants when she wants it. She is a chronic pants-wetter, though she is the same age as Ellen. * Julia, Ellen's grade school art teacher who takes her temporarily after another teacher learns that she is being abused at home. Julia is a hippie raised in the Northeast, who has migrated to the South after college with her husband, Roy. She is very liberal and encourages Ellen in her artistic endeavors. * Roy, Julia's husband, is a progressively minded hippie who keeps an organic garden that he fertilizes with chicken manure, with which Ellen is fascinated. He bakes Ellen a lovely cake for her birthday and does not mind taking care of other household chores typically performed by a woman. * Rudolph & Ellis - Ellen's uncles on her father's side, who agree to spy on Ellen and her father for Ellen's grandmother. They make inaccurate reports that Ellen is wild and a troublemaker and are compensated by Ellen's grandmother with large sums of money, some of which she instructs them to give to Ellen and her father for the bare necessities. * Stella, Ellen's foster sister at her new mama's house, is a big flirt and sits at the back of the bus with the boys on the way to school. As a seventh grader, she is a mother to a fatherless baby, Roger, and is the youngest mother Ellen has ever known. * Roger is Stella's baby son who likes to crawl into Ellen's room and chew on objects he finds on the floor. * Betsy is Ellen's aunt on her mother's side who allows Ellen to stay with her for a weekend and finds it funny when Ellen had misunderstood that she would be staying permanently. She is petty and bickers with Nadine, her sister, when their mother dies. * Dolphin is the horse Ellen rides and cares for at her new mama's house. * Jo Jo is Ellen's new foster sister who loves to dance to music with no words.

Cargas, published by University Press of Kentucky, 1993. In February 1943, he joined the Soviet partisans of the Markov Brigade, a primarily non-Jewish unit in which he had to contend with antisemitism. Apart from a foray infiltrating the Vilna Ghetto in April 1943 to meet with underground leader Abba Kovner, he stayed with the Soviet partisans until the end of the war, fighting the Germans, taking part in mining trains and in ambushes around the Naroch Forest of Belarus. \\"The official attitude of the Soviet partisan movement was that there was no place for Jewish units\\" acting independently, said Arad.Yitzhak Arad interview for Martyrdom & Resistance, September/October 2010. Tishri/Cheshvan, 5771 In autobiographical book, The Partisan, published in 1979, Arad describes among others his participation in punitive rally on the civilians of the village of Girdan (on page 158): \\"The last operation I participated in that winter was a punitive action against Girdan, a large Lithuanian village on the road between Hoduciszki and Swienciany.‚Äù and against Lithuanian partisants (on page 182): \\"I participated in this mopping-up operation. We thoroughly combed the forests of the region. The deep snow made walking difficult, but it also revealed the footsteps of the Lithuanian bands. After a few days of searching we discovered their encampment. Their forest camp was fenced in and had underground bunkers. We fought with them for a whole day, but by evening none of them remained alive. The next day we counted over 250 Lithuanian dead. Some were in a field near a lake to which they had tried to escape.\\" In December 1945, Yitzhak Arad immigrated without authorization to Mandate Palestine , on the Ha'apala boat named after Hannah Szenes. In Arad's military career in the IDF, he reached the rank of brigadier general and was appointed to the post of Chief Education Officer. He retired from the military in 1972. Academic career In his academic career as a lecturer on Jewish history at Tel Aviv University, he has researched World War II and the Holocaust, and has published extensively as author and editor, primarily in Hebrew. His current research deals with the Holocaust in the USSR. Dr. Yitzhak Arad served as the director (Chairman of the Directorate) of Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust Remembrance Authority, for 21 years (1972‚Äì1993). He remains associated with Yad Vashem in an advisor's capacity. Arad was awarded Doctor honoris causa degree by Poland's Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toru≈Ñ on 7 June 1993. Dismissed investigation in Lithuania In 2006, following a story in the Lithuanian Respublika newspaper that called Arad a \\"war criminal\\" for his alleged role in the Koniuchy massacre perpetrated by anti-Nazi Soviet partisans, the Lithuanian state prosecutor initiated an investigation of Arad. Following an international outcry, the investigation was dropped in the fall of 2008.The Crime of Surviving, Tablet, Dovid Katz, May 2010 Arad said he had nothing to apologize for, and that he was \\"proud\\" that he \\"fought the Nazi Germans and their Lithuanian collaborators ... the murderers of my family, the murderers of my people.\\"Double Genocide, Daniel Brook, Slate, 2015 Arad has said he believes the investigation was motivated by revenge for expert evidence he gave in a United States trial of a Lithuanian Nazi collaborator.Reopening Lithuania's old wounds, BBC, 21 July 2008 British historian Martin Gilbert said he was \\"deeply shocked\\" by the \\"perverse\\" investigation. Efraim Zuroff pointed out that the Lithuanian government had never prosecuted a single war criminal, despite the evidence that Simon Wiesenthal Center had collected and shared. According to Zuroff, \\"What is common to all these cases is that they're all Jews.

According to Dovid Katz, this is \\"Holocaust obfuscation\\" that \\"involves a series of false moral equivalences: Jews were disloyal citizens of pre-war Lithuania, helped the Soviet occupiers in 1940, and were therefore partly to blame for their fate.

Originally built for the United States Navy (USN) as the , the ship was decommissioned in 1994 and sold to the RAN. After entering service with the RAN in 1999, Kanimbla participated in numerous worldwide deployments, including the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, and in response to the 2006 Fijian coup d'√©tat. During the ship's career, two helicopters were lost in crashes. After a fire broke out aboard Kanimbla in late 2010, she and sister ship were removed from active service because of extensive problems found aboard both ships. The intention was to repair Kanimbla and return her to service by 2012, but this was deemed uneconomical. The ship was decommissioned in 2011, and sold for breaking in 2013.

The high cost of the project led to its cancellation by the Minister for Defence in 1993, with the instructions to find a cheaper alternative. In 1994, the RAN was able to acquire the surplus Saginaw and her sister ship for the combined price of A$61 million (US$40 million).Scherer, Senate hampers sale of Navy ships to eager nations Saginaw was to be renamed Kanimbla. Prior to Saginaws decommissioning and transfer, a RAN crew was sent to Norfolk, Virginia, for several weeks training aboard the vessel, as they were to sail her to Australia after she was commissioned into the RAN.Put in our place, in Australia and World Affairs, p. 43 Saginaw was decommissioned on 28 June 1994, but instead of being immediately recommissioned as HMAS Kanimbla, it was announced at the decommissioning ceremony that the United States Congress had decided not to release the ships into foreign service.Put in our place, in Australia and World Affairs, pp. 43‚Äì44 The last-minute move was part of a sale blockage for fifteen surplus Newports to nine nations, and was caused by the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services in an attempt to pressure US President Bill Clinton on the perceived running-down of the USN's amphibious warfare capability, as well as the concerns of one Senator over human rights in Morocco (one of the other nations slated to acquire a Newport-class ship).Put in our place, in Australia and World Affairs, p. 44 The sale was not approved until the start of August, with the ship commissioned into the RAN on 29 August 1994.US OKs sale of 2 ships, in Sun Herald Kanimbla with a LCM-8 Kanimbla sailed to Australia in October, after training and maintenance checks were completed.

Shortly after this, Kanimbla and sister ship Manoora were brought to Fleet Base East for an 'operational pause' after several problems were identified with both ships.McPhedran, The rust never sleeps on pride of navy fleetKerr, Operational tempo and neglect spell problems for ageing Australian amphibs These included large quantities of corrosion and faults with the deck crane and alarm system, along with the need to overhaul the propulsion system, power generators, and air-conditioning, and upgrade the communication suite. The problems have been attributed to the ship's high operational tempo, delays in maintenance, and the age of the ships. Manoora was marked for decommissioning in early 2011, but the intention at that time was to repair Kanimbla and return her to active service by mid-2012. However, the predicted timeframe and cost of the repairs (18 months and over $35 million), and the successful acquisition of the British landing ship dock (which entered RAN service at the end of 2011 as HMAS Choules) prompted the Australian government to announce plans on 18 August 2011 to decommission Kanimbla. The decommissioning occurred on 25 November 2011.Brooke, Decommissioning marks end of an era The ship's capability was initially replaced by Choules, until the amphibious warfare ships entered service.Stephen Smith MP Minister for Defence, Transition plan to Landing Helicopter DockMinister for Defence Materiel and Minister for Defence, Decommissioning of HMAS Kanimbla In June 2012, the federal government offered Kanimbla and Manoora to the Queensland state government for scuttling as dive wrecks off the Queensland coast.Marshall, Naval ships offered as dive sites for coast However, the government chose not to go ahead with this, as it would cost $4 million each to prepare them for scuttling, and could provoke similar reactions to the contested sinking of the frigate .McPhedran, Navy workhorses HMAS Manoora and HMAS Kanimbla to end careers as scrap Instead, Kanimbla was to be broken up, with an estimated scrap metal value of $2.5 million. Because the two vessels were originally owned by the United States and were sold to Australia, their disposal had to receive US government approval and comply with International Traffic in Arms Regulations.Australian Defence Magazine, Sale of decommissioned ships Manoora and Kanimbla Tendering for the disposal of the vessels began in June 2012, with the contract awarded to Southern Recycling on 20 May 2013.

Operational history =Pre-war= MV Kanimbla off Gabo Island 16 June 1937 The ship arrived in Melbourne 12 June 1936 and operated a passenger service between Cairns and Fremantle. The ship accommodated 203 first class and 198 cabin class passengers. This passenger service continued until the outbreak of World War II. =World War II= Om 5 September 1939, Kanimbla was requisitioned for military service, and underwent conversion to an armed merchant cruiser at Garden Island in Sydney.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 216 She was commissioned into the Royal Navy as HMS Kanimbla, though with a largely Australian crew, on 6 September 1939. The ship was initially assigned the pennant number F23 - and later given the pennant number C78. Kanimbla was engaged in patrolling the coasts of Asia and boarding vessels of German or occupied Europe origin. On 24 August 1941, Kanimbla led a raid to capture the Iranian port of Bandar Shahpur. The ship led seven other vessels, including the gunboat , the corvette , the naval trawler HMT Arthur Cavannagh, the sloop , an oil rig tugboat, and a dhow. In addition, Kanimbla carried 300 Indian troops, including Gurkhas and soldiers from 3rd Battalion, 10th Baluch Regiment, whose task was to board and capture the German cargo ship Hohenfels. Kanimbla used her armament in support of the raid, which resulted in the securing of the railhead, and the capture of eight Axis merchantmen, two gunboats, and a floating dock were captured as well as the railhead.Australians at War Kanimbla was one of several Allied vessels located in Sydney Harbour during the covert attack by Japanese midget submarines on the night of 31 May 1942. She arrived back in Sydney on 2 April 1943, was converted to a Landing Ship Infantry (LSI) and commissioned into the Royal Australian Navy as HMAS Kanimbla on 1 June 1943. She received the pennant number C78.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 217 In this configuration, she could carry 1,280 troops, and carried up to 22 LCVPs, plus two Landing Craft Mechanised.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 215 The ship earned five battle honours for her wartime service: \\"New Guinea 1944\\", \\"Leyte Gulf 1944\\", \\"Lingayen Gulf 1945\\", \\"Borneo 1945\\", and \\"Pacific 1945\\". =Post-war= Kanimbla paid off at Sydney on 25 March 1949 and was returned to her owners on 13 December 1950 after being converted back by the Cockatoo Docks & Engineering CompanyThe Kanimbla Returns to Service Avon Argus & Cunderdin- Meckering-Tammin Mail 28 December 1950 page 2 with the ship subsequently bringing European migrants to Australia and later taking Australian tourists to Japan and other parts of Asia.http://collections.anmm.gov.au/objects/197157 In 1961, the ship was sold to the Pacific Transport Company and renamed Oriental Queen. For the next three years, the ship was chartered to transport pilgrims between Indonesia and Jeddah. In 1964, Oriental Queen was chartered by a Japanese shipping company and served as a liner on the Yokohama ‚Äì Guam route. The vessel was later sold outright to the Japanese charterer. Oriental Queens career ended in 1973, with the ship's sale to Taiwanese breakers for scrapping.  Legacy  The suburb of Kanimbla in Cairns was named after the ship.

He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1966 to 1981, and served as a cabinet minister in the governments of Walter Weir and Sterling Lyon. Born in Baldur, Manitoba, Craik was educated at the University of Manitoba and the University of Minnesota, earning his Master of Science and Master of Education degrees. He worked as a mechanical engineer and associate professor of engineering after his graduation. He was the chairman of the St. Vital School Board from 1962 to 1964, and director the Manitoba Research Council from 1964 to 1966. Craik also worked as a consulting engineer in Winnipeg from 1966 until his death. He married the former Shirley Hill and they had three children: Judy (1958), Polly (1961), and Donna (1964). During the 1970s, Craik opened Fine Line Telephone Answering and Secretarial Services. He was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1966, scoring a relatively easy victory in the Winnipeg riding of St. Vital. Despite his youth and relative inexperience, he was appointed to cabinet on November 7, 1967, as Minister of Mines and Natural Resources. On September 24, 1968, he was named Minister of Youth and Education with responsibility for the Public Libraries Act and the Legislative Library Act. As education minister, Craik passed legislation allowing aboriginal Canadians to vote (and be elected to) local school boards. He credited a private member's bill from NDP MLA Sidney Green as the inspiration for this legislation. His first tenure in cabinet proved short- lived, as the Tories lost the 1969 election to the New Democratic Party. Craik himself defeated New Democratic challenger James Buchanan by only 29 votes in the redistributed riding of Riel. In the 1973 election, he defeated cabinet minister Wilson Parasiuk by a slightly greater margin. The Tories returned to power in the 1977 election, and Craik was re-elected over NDP candidate Doreen Dodick by almost 4,000 votes. On October 24, 1977, he was appointed Minister of Finance, Chairman of the Manitoba Energy Council and minister responsible for Manitoba Hydro. He held these positions until January 16, 1981, and also served as Chairman of the Treasury Board from October 20, 1978 to November 23, 1979 and Minister of Energy and Mines with responsibility for Manitoba Forestry Resources Limited. On January 16, 1981, Craik was appointed deputy premier, with responsibility for the Manitoba Energy Council and the Manitoba Development Corporation. The Tories lost power to the NDP in the 1981 provincial election, and Craik personally lost to Doreen Dodick by 242 votes in a rematch from 1977. He died at his cottage at Clearwater Bay, Ontario in 1985, at the relatively young age of 54. He had previously suffered a heart attack in the 1970s. There is currently a Donald Craik Engineering Library at the University of Manitoba. The same institution offers a Don Craik Memorial Scholarship.

The pool of assets is typically a group of small and illiquid assets which are unable to be sold individually. Pooling the assets into financial instruments allows them to be sold to general investors, a process called securitization, and allows the risk of investing in the underlying assets to be diversified because each security will represent a fraction of the total value of the diverse pool of underlying assets. The pools of underlying assets can include common payments from credit cards, auto loans, and mortgage loans, to esoteric cash flows from aircraft leases, royalty payments, or movie revenues. Often a separate institution, called a special purpose vehicle, is created to handle the securitization of asset backed securities. The special purpose vehicle, which creates and sells the securities, uses the proceeds of the sale to pay back the bank that created, or originated, the underlying assets. The special purpose vehicle is responsible for \\"bundling\\" the underlying assets into a specified pool that will fit the risk preferences and other needs of investors who might want to buy the securities, for managing credit risk ‚Äì often by transferring it to an insurance company after paying a premium ‚Äì and for distributing payments from the securities. As long as the credit risk of the underlying assets is transferred to another institution, the originating bank removes the value of the underlying assets from its balance sheet and receives cash in return as the asset backed securities are sold, a transaction which can improve its credit rating and reduce the amount of capital that it needs. In this case, a credit rating of the asset backed securities would be based only on the assets and liabilities of the special purpose vehicle, and this rating could be higher than if the originating bank issued the securities because the risk of the asset backed securities would no longer be associated with other risks that the originating bank might bear. A higher credit rating could allow the special purpose vehicle and, by extension, the originating institution to pay a lower interest rate (and hence, charge a higher price) on the asset-backed securities than if the originating institution borrowed funds or issued bonds. Thus, one incentive for banks to create securitized assets is to remove risky assets from their balance sheet by having another institution assume the credit risk, so that they (the banks) receive cash in return. This allows banks to invest more of their capital in new loans or other assets and possibly have a lower capital requirement. Definition An \\"asset-backed security\\" is sometimes used as an umbrella term for a type of security backed by a pool of assets,assets that otherwise could not be traded has been securitized. MBS and CDO compared: an empirical analysis and sometimes for a particular type of that security ‚Äì one backed by consumer loans or loans, leases or receivables other than real estate. In the first case, collateralized debt obligations (CDO, securities backed by debt obligations ‚Äì often other asset-backed securities) and mortgage-backed securities (MBS, where the assets are mortgages), are subsets, different kinds of asset-backed securities. (Example: \\"The capital market in which asset-backed securities are issued and traded is composed of three main categories: ABS, MBS and CDOs\\". (italics added)source: ). In the second case, an \\"asset-backed security\\" ‚Äì or at least the abbreviation \\"ABS\\" ‚Äì refers to just one of the subsets, one backed by consumer-backed products, and is distinct from a MBS or CDO, (example: \\"As a rule of thumb, securitization issues backed by mortgages are called MBS, and securitization issues backed by debt obligations are called CDO .... Securitization issues backed by consumer-backed products ‚Äì car loans, consumer loans and credit cards, among others ‚Äì are called ABSsee also Structure On January 18, 2005, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) promulgated Regulation AB which included a final definition of Asset-Backed Securities.\\"Financial Services Alert\\" Goodwin and Procter, January 18th 2005, Vol. 8 NO. 22 :\\"Definition of ABS. The term \\"asset-backed security\\" is currently defined in Form S-3 to mean a security that is primarily serviced by the cash flows of a discrete pool of receivables or other financial assets, either fixed or revolving, that by their terms convert into cash within a finite time period plus any rights or other assets designed to assure the servicing or timely distribution of proceeds to the security holders. The SEC has interpreted the phrase \\"convert into cash by their terms\\" to exclude most assets that require active behavior to acquire cash ‚Äì such as the selling of non-performing assets and physical property. It has also interpreted the phrase \\"discrete pool\\" to exclude those that can change in composition over time. :* Lease-Backed Securities. The new rule expands the definition of \\"asset-backed security\\" to include lease-backed securities as long as the residual value of the leased property is less than 50% of the original securitized pool balance (or less than 65% in the case of motor vehicle leases). However, such securities may be shelf-registered on Form S-3 only if the residual value of the leased property represents less than 20% of the original securitized pool balance (or less than 65% in the case of motor vehicle leases). :* Delinquent and Non-performing Assets. The new rules provide that a security may be considered to be an \\"asset-backed security\\" even if the underlying asset pool has total delinquencies of up to 50% at the time of the proposed offering as long as the original asset pool does not include any \\"non-performing\\" assets. However, consistent with current practice, shelf registration on [Form S-3] {lacks definition} will be available only if delinquent assets constitute 20% or less of the original asset pool. An asset is considered to be non-performing if it satisfies the charge-off policies of the sponsor (or applicable bank regulatory agencies) or if it would be considered a charged-off asset under the terms of the applicable transaction documents. :* Exceptions to the \\"Discrete Pool\\" Requirement. The new rules generally codify the SEC staff‚Äôs position that a security must be backed by a discrete pool of assets in order to be considered an ABS. However, the new rules establish the following exceptions to address market practices. ::(1) Any security issued in a master trust structure would meet the definition of \\"asset-backed security\\" without limitation. ::(2) \\"asset-backed securities\\" will also include securities with a prefunding period of up to one year during which up to 50% of the offering proceeds (or, in the case of master trusts, up to 50% of the aggregate principal balance of the total asset pool whose cash flows support the ABS) may be used for subsequent purchases of pool assets. ::(3) The new rules also include within the definition of \\"asset-backed security\\" securities with revolving periods during which new financial assets may be acquired. In the case of revolving assets such as credit cards, dealer floorplan and home equity lines of credit, there is no limit to the length of the revolving period or the amount of new assets that can be purchased during that time. For securities backed by receivables or other financial assets that do not arise under revolving accounts, such as automobile loans and mortgage loans, an unlimited revolving period will be permitted for up to three years. However, the new assets added to the pool during the revolving period must be of the same general character as the original pool assets. According to Thomson Financial League Tables, US issuance (excluding mortgage-backed securities) was: * 2004: USD 857 billion (1,595 issues) * 2003: USD 581 billion (1,175 issues) Types =Home equity loans= Securities collateralized by home equity loans (HELs) are currently the largest asset class within the ABS market. Investors typically refer to HELs as any nonagency loans that do not fit into either the jumbo or alt-A loan categories. While early HELs were mostly second lien subprime mortgages, first-lien loans now make up the majority of issuance. Subprime mortgage borrowers have a less than perfect credit history and are required to pay interest rates higher than what would be available to a typical agency borrower. In addition to first and second-lien loans, other HE loans can consist of high loan to value (LTV) loans, re-performing loans, scratch and dent loans, or open-ended home equity lines of credit (HELOC),which homeowners use as a method to consolidate debt.\\"Fixed Income Sectors: Asset-Backed Securities: A primer on asset-backed securities\\", Dwight Asset management Company 2005 =Auto loans= The second largest subsector in the ABS market is auto loans. Auto finance companies issue securities backed by underlying pools of auto-related loans. Auto ABS are classified into three categories: prime, nonprime, and subprime: * Prime auto ABS are collaterized by loans made to borrowers with strong credit histories. * Nonprime auto ABS consist of loans made to lesser credit quality consumers, which may have higher cumulative losses. * Subprime borrowers will typically have lower incomes, tainted credited histories, or both. Owner trusts are the most common structure used when issuing auto loans and allow investors to receive interest and principal on sequential basis. Deals can also be structured to pay on a pro-rata or combination of the two. =Credit card receivables= Securities backed by credit card receivables have been benchmark for the ABS market since they were first introduced in 1987. Credit card holders may borrow funds on a revolving basis up to an assigned credit limit. The borrowers then pay principal and interest as desired, along with the required minimum monthly payments. Because principal repayment is not scheduled, credit card debt does not have an actual maturity date and is considered a nonamortizing loan. ABS backed by credit card receivables are issued out of trusts that have evolved over time from discrete trusts to various types of master trusts of which the most common is the de-linked master trust. Discrete trusts consist of a fixed or static pool of receivables that are tranched into senior/subordinated bonds. A master trust has the advantage of offering multiple deals out of the same trust as the number of receivables grows, each of which is entitled to a pro-rata share of all of the receivables. The delinked structures allow the issuer to separate the senior and subordinate series within a trust and issue them at different points in time. The latter two structures allow investors to benefit from a larger pool of loans made over time rather than one static pool. =Student loans= ABS collateralized by student loans (‚ÄúSLABS‚Äù) comprise one of the four (along with home equity loans, auto loans, and credit card receivables) core asset classes financed through asset-backed securitizations and are a benchmark subsector for most floating rate indices . Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) loans are the most common form of student loans and are guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education (\\"USDE\\") at rates ranging from 95%‚Äì98% (if the student loan is serviced by a servicer designated as an \\"exceptional performer\\" by the USDE the reimbursement rate was up to 100%). As a result, performance (other than high cohort default rates in the late 1980s) has historically been very good and investors rate of return has been excellent. The College Cost Reduction and Access Act became effective on October 1, 2007 and significantly changed the economics for FFELP loans; lender special allowance payments were reduced, the exceptional performer designation was revoked, lender insurance rates were reduced, and the lender paid origination fees were doubled. A second, and faster growing, portion of the student loan market consists of non-FFELP or private student loans. Though borrowing limits on certain types of FFELP loans were slightly increased by the student loan bill referenced above, essentially static borrowing limits for FFELP loans and increasing tuition are driving students to search for alternative lenders. Students utilize private loans to bridge the gap between amounts that can be borrowed through federal programs and the remaining costs of education. The United States Congress created the Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae) as a government sponsored enterprise to purchase student loans in the secondary market and to securitize pools of student loans. Since its first issuance in 1995, Sallie Mae is now the major issuer of SLABS and its issues are viewed as the benchmark issues. Although to a few this may have been unfair or inflationary, it appeared to have been legitimate. =Stranded cost utilities= Rate reduction bonds (RRBs) came about as the result of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, which was designed to increase competition in the US electricity market. To avoid any disruptions while moving from a non-competitive to a competitive market, regulators have allowed utilities to recover certain \\"transition costs\\" over a period of time. These costs are considered non-bypassable and are added to all customer bills. Since consumers usually pay utility bills before any other, chargeoffs have historically been low. RRBs offerings are typically large enough to create reasonable liquidity in the aftermarket, and average life extension is limited by a \\"true up\\" mechanism. =Others= There are many other cash-flow-producing assets, including manufactured housing loans, equipment leases and loans, aircraft leases, trade receivables, dealer floor plan loans, securities portfolios, and royalties. Intangibles are another emerging asset class.Intangible Asset Finance Trading asset-backed securities \\"In the United States, the process for issuing asset-backed securities in the primary market is similar to that of issuing other securities, such as corporate bonds, and is governed by the Securities Act of 1933, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Publicly issued asset-backed securities have to satisfy standard SEC registration and disclosure requirements, and have to file periodic financial statements.\\"T Sabarwal \\"Common Structures of Asset-Backed Securities and Their Risks, December 29, 2005 \\"The Process of trading asset-backed securities in the secondary market is similar to that of trading corporate bonds, and also to some extent, mortgage-backed securities. Most of the trading is done in over- the-counter markets, with telephone quotes on a security basis. There appear to be no publicly available measures of trading volume, or of number of dealers trading in these securities.\\" \\"A survey by the Bond Market Association shows that at the end of 2004, in the United States and Europe there were 74 electronic trading platforms for trading fixed-income securities and derivatives, with 5 platforms for asset-backed securities in the United States, and 8 in Europe.\\" \\"Discussions with market participants show that compared to Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities, many asset- backed securities are not liquid, and their prices are not transparent. This is partly because asset-backed securities are not as standardized as Treasury securities, or even mortgage-backed securities, and investors have to evaluate the different structures, maturity profiles, credit enhancements, and other features of an asset-backed security before trading it.\\" The \\"price\\" of an asset-backed security is usually quoted as a spread to a corresponding swap rate. For example, the price of a credit card-backed, AAA rated security with a two-year maturity by a benchmark issuer might be quoted at 5 basis points (or less) to the two-year swap rate.\\" \\"Indeed, market participants sometimes view the highest-rated credit card and automobile securities as having default risk close to that of the highest-rated mortgage-backed securities, which are reportedly viewed as substitute for the default risk-free Treasury securities.\\" Securitization Securitization is the process of creating asset-backed securities by transferring assets from the issuing company to a bankruptcy remote entity. Credit enhancement is an integral component of this process as it creates a security that has a higher rating than the issuing company, which allows the issuing company to monetize its assets while paying a lower rate of interest than would be possible via a secured bank loan or debt issuance by the issuing company. ABS indices On January 17, 2006, CDS Indexco and Markit launched ABX.HE, a synthetic asset-backed credit derivative index, with plans to extend the index to other underlying asset types other than home equity loans.Markit ABS indices allow investors to gain broad exposure to the subprime market without holding the actual asset-backed securities. Advantages and disadvantages A significant advantage of asset- backed securities for loan originators (with associated disadvantages for investors) is that they bring together a pool of financial assets that otherwise could not easily be traded in their existing form. By pooling together a large portfolio of these illiquid assets they can be converted into instruments that may be offered and sold freely in the capital markets. The tranching of these securities into instruments with theoretically different risk/return profiles facilitates marketing of the bonds to investors with different risk appetites and investing time horizons. Asset backed securities provide originators with the following advantages, each of which directly adds to investor risk: * Selling these financial assets to the pools reduces their risk-weighted assets and thereby frees up their capital, enabling them to originate still more loans. * Asset-backed securities lower their risk. In a worst-case scenario where the pool of assets performs very badly, \\"the owner of ABS (which is either the issuer, or the guarantor, or the re-modeler, or the guarantor of the last resort) might pay the price of bankruptcy rather than the originator.\\" In case the originator or the issuer is made to pay the price of the same, it amounts to re-inventing of the lending practices, restructuring from other profitable avenues of the functioning of the originator as well as the norms of the issuance of the same and consolidation in the form of either merger or benchmarking (internal same sector, external different sector). This risk is measured and contained by the lender of last resort from time to time auctions and other Instruments that are used to re- inject the same bad loans held over a longer time duration to the appropriate buyers over a period of time based on the instruments available for the bank to carry out its business as per the business charter or the licensings granted to the specific banks. The risk can also be diversified by using the alternate geographies, or alternate vehicles of investments and alternate division of the bank, depending on the type and magnitude of the risk. The exposure of these refinanced loans to \\"bad credit\\" (Type II) decisions (particularly in the banking sector, unscrupulous lending or the adverse selection of credits) is hedged against by the sellers of the same, or the re- structurers of the same. Thinking of securitization (insurance) as a panacea for all the ills of bad credit decisions might lead to the hedging of the risk by the transfer of the \\"hot potato\\" from one issuer to another without the actual asset against which the loan is backed reaching an upswing in value, either by the demand-supply mismatch being addressed or by one of the following factors: * The economic productivity of the business cycle being reversed from downturn to upturn (monetary and fiscal measures) * More buyers than sellers in the market * A breakthrough innovation. On a day-to-day basis the transferring of the loans from the * Sub-ordinate debt (freshly made and highly collateralized debt) to the * Sub-ordinate realizable * Sub-ordinate non-realizable Senior as well as bad (securitized) debt might be a better way to distinguish between the assets that might require or be found eligible for re-insurance or write ‚Äì off or impaired against the assets of the collaterals or is realized as a trade-off of the loan granted against or the addition of goods or services. This is totally built up in any bank based on the terms of these deposits, and dynamic updation of the same as regards to the extent of the exposure or bad credit to be faced, as guided by the accounting standards, and adjudged by the financial and non-market (diversifiable) risks, with a contingency for the market (non-diversifiable) risks, for the specified types of the accounting headers as found in the balance sheets or the reporting or recognition (company based declaration of the standards) of the same as short term, long term as well as medium term debt and depreciation standards. The issuance of the accounting practices and standards as regards to the different holding patterns, adds to the accountability that is sought, in case the problem increases in magnitude. * The originators earn fees from originating the loans, as well as from servicing the assets throughout their life. The ability to earn substantial fees from originating and securitizing loans, coupled with the absence of any residual liability, skews the incentives of originators in favor of loan volume rather than loan quality. This is an intrinsic structural flaw in the loan-securitization market that was directly responsible for both the credit bubble of the mid-2000s (decade) as well as the credit crisis, and the concomitant banking crisis, of 2008. \\"The financial institutions that originate the loans sell a pool of cashflow-producing assets to a specially created \\"third party that is called a special-purpose vehicle (SPV)\\". The SPV (securitization, credit derivatives, commodity derivative, commercial paper based temporary capital and funding sought for the running, merger activities of the company, external funding in the form of venture capitalists, angel investors etc. being a few of them) is \\"designed to insulate investors from the credit risk (availability as well as issuance of credit in terms of assessment of bad loans or hedging of the already available good loans as part of the practice) of the originating financial institution\\". The SPV then sells the pooled loans to a trust, which issues interest bearing securities that can achieve a credit rating separate from the financial institution that originates the loan. The typically higher credit rating is given because the securities that are used to fund the securitization rely solely on the cash flow created by the assets, not on the payment promise of the issuer. The monthly payments from the underlying assets ‚Äì loans or receivables ‚Äì typically consist of principal and interest, with principal being scheduled or unscheduled. The cash flows produced by the underlying assets can be allocated to investors in different ways. Cash flows can be directly passed through to investors after administrative fees are subtracted, thus creating a ‚Äúpass- through‚Äù security; alternatively, cash flows can be carved up according to specified rules and market demand, thus creating \\"structured\\" securities.\\" This is an organized way of functioning of the credit markets at least in the Developed Primary non-tradable in the open market, company to company, bank to bank dealings to keep the markets running, afloat as well as operational and provision of the liquidity by the liquidity providers in the market, which is very well scrutinized for any \\"aberration, excessive instrument based hedging and market manipulation\\" or \\"outlier, volumes\\" based trades or any such \\"anomalies, block trades 'company treasury' based decision without proper and posterior/prior intimation\\", by the respective regulators as directed by the law and as spotted in the regular hours of trading in the pre-market/after- hours trading or in the event based specific stocks and corrected and scrutinized for insider trading in the form of cancellation of the trades, re- issuance of the amount of the cancelled trades or freezing of the markets (specific securities being taken off the trading list for the duration of time) in event of a pre-set, defined by the maximum and minimum fluctuation in the trading in the secondary market that is the over the counter markets. Generally the Primary markets are more scrutinized by the same commission but this market comes under the category of institutional and company related trades and underwritings, as well as guarantees and hence is governed by the broader set of rules as directed in the corporate and business law and reporting standards governing the business in the specific geography.

Because of its unincorporated status, Midlothian has no formal government, and the name is used to represent either the original small Village of Midlothian, located on Midlothian Turnpike (US-60) between Old Buckingham Road and Salisbury Drive, or a vast expanse of Chesterfield County in the northwest portion of Southside Richmond covered by three zip codes (23112, 23113, 23114) served by the Midlothian post office. These zip codes are not coterminous with the Midlothian Magisterial District associated with the Chesterfield County government. The Village of Midlothian was named for the early 18th-century coal mining enterprises of the Wooldridge family. Incorporated in 1836, their Mid-Lothian Mining and Manufacturing Company employed free and enslaved people to do the deadly work of digging underground. Midlothian is the site of the first commercially-mined coal in the Colony of Virginia and North America. By the early 18th century, several mines were being developed in Chesterfield County by French Huguenots and others. The mine owners began to export the commodity from the region in the 1730s. Midlothian-area coal from Harry Heth's Black Heath mines heated the U.S. White House for President Thomas Jefferson. The transportation needs of coal shipping stimulated construction of a paved toll road (Virginia's first), the Manchester Turnpike in 1807; and the Chesterfield Railroad, Virginia's first, in 1831; each traveled the from the mining community to the port of Manchester, just below the Fall Line of the James River. In 1850, the Richmond and Danville Railroad built Coalfield Station, a freight and later passenger depot, near the mines. In the 1920s, the old turnpike was straightened and became part of the new east-west U.S. Route 60. A few decades later, residential neighborhoods were developed in Southside Richmond near Midlothian, including the large Salisbury community and the Brandermill planned development sited on Swift Creek Reservoir. In the 21st century, Midlothian extends many miles beyond the original village area. State Route 288 connects the community with Interstate 64 and the State Route 76 \\"Powhite Parkway\\" toll road, and Interstate 95 in the Richmond metropolitan area's southwestern quadrant. { \\"type\\": \\"FeatureCollection\\", \\"features\\": [ { \\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"properties\\": {\\"title\\": \\"look at this!\\", \\"marker-symbol\\": \\"-letter-see\\"}, \\"geometry\\": {\\"type\\": \\"Point\\", \\"coordinates\\": [-77.648, 37.508]} }, { \\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"properties\\": {\\"title\\": \\"Chesterfield Town Center)\\", \\"marker-symbol\\": \\"-letter-see\\"}, \\"geometry\\": {\\"type\\": \\"Point\\", \\"coordinates\\": [-77.60866641998291, 37.507853476646744]} } ]}  Geography  Midlothian is located in the Piedmont geologic region of the state, and is made up of mainly a hilled, fertile land (it is somewhat of a plain.) It is located on the Richmond Basin, which is one of the Eastern North America Rift Basins. It contains some sedimentary rock and bituminous coal. =Watersheds= The Midlothian area serves as the headwaters to a number of creeks which ultimately contribute their waters to the flow of the James River. These include Swift Creek and Falling Creek. The Swift Creek Reservoir serves as the major source of fresh water for the county.  Demographics  As of the 2010 census, the community had a total population of 58,880. Midlothian's demographics are much like Virginia's. Its inhabitants are predominantly European American. The next biggest group is African Americans, followed by people of Hispanic and Asian descent. The median household income per year in 2005 was $80,381. The traditional core of the Village of Midlothian on Route 60 is between two major shopping malls developed later. Midlothian has many neighborhoods; Some examples off Route 60 include Briarwood, Roxshire, and Salisbury to the north; and Walton Park, Queensmill, and Stonehenge to the south. Woodlake, Virginia and Brandermill, Virginia are communities on Route 360 (also known as Hull St Rd). Midlothian was ranked #37 in CNNMoney's list of \\"The Best Places to Live\\" in 2005 and #99 in 2008. Economy There is little farming and only light manufacturing around the new State Route 288. At the turn of the 21st century, a group of area business professionals formed an independent organization called the Western Chesterfield Business Alliance, which in 2013 was renamed the Midlothian Business Alliance. Infrastructure In 2004, completion of State Route 288 connected Midlothian to the circumferential highway network of greater Richmond Region. Development was controversial, and some residents wanted to avoid the scale seen in Northern Virginia. After years of discussion, in March 2006 Chesterfield County approved intensive zoning for the Watkins Centre, promoted as a large, mixed-use office complex and retail \\"lifestyle center\\" at the intersection of Route 288 and U.S. 60, west of the Village of Midlothian. With the addition of the multimillion-dollar Bon Secours Hospital, St. Francis, Midlothian has a major hospital within five minutes of Midlothian's highest concentration of residents. James River High School, part of Chesterfield County Public Schools located in Midlothian, won the President's Blue Ribbon School of Excellence Award in 2000. In 2015, Cosby High School, also located in Midlothian, received this recognition.Cosby High is named a National Blue Ribbon School mychesterfieldschools.com, 25 September 2015  History  =Etymology= The origins of the name of Midlothian are subject to debate. Many think that the name came from two brothers from East Lothian and West Lothian in Scotland who founded a village. For the name of the village they decided to name it after their respective homelands and a compromise was made, thus making the name of Midlothian. However, this story is mostly a legend based in some truth. The two brothers who were said to have founded the village were likely Abraham Salle and Dr. Archibald Logwood Wooldridge (often called A. S. and A. L. Wooldridge). They, along with their two sisters, Jane Elam and Charlotte Wooldridge, incorporated a mining company called the Midlothian Coal Mining Company in 1835. This company's lands consisted of most of the present-day land south of Midlothian Turnpike in the village of Midlothian and is thought to have given its name to the village. The name of the coal company came from the Midlothian tract of land that was one of the two tracts that made up the company's original land holdings of 404 1/2 acres. The name of the tract came from a house ( demolished in the 1900s in a fire department exercise) that was located on the tract that was also named Midlothian and was owned by the Wooldridge family. The first Wooldridge in America and the one who had assembled most of the Midlothian area lands, John Wooldridge (great-grandfather of the two brothers), came in the late 17th century from England. However, his ancestors in England had connections with the region of Midlothian in Scotland and it is from here that the name is originally derived. Another interesting note about the name is that the village has not always been called Midlothian. In the late 1700s, the area was listed on maps simply as \\"Coal Mines\\" and later came to be known as Coalfield. The modern-day Coalfield Rd is a remnant of this name. When the Richmond and Danville Railroad went through the village, their station (First built in 1850, destroyed in 1864 during the Civil War, second station built in 1866 and demolished in 1957. The station stood at the intersection of Salisbury Dr and the railroad.) was called Coalfield Station. The US Post Office established at the station, however, had the name of Midlothian. This reflected the rise in importance of the Midlothian Coal Mining Company. By the late 1800s, the area had ceased to be called Coalfield and was almost always called Midlothian. =Early History= Before the arrival of Europeans in the 17th century, the area had been populated for thousands of years by various cultures of Native Americans. Among these in historic times were the Siouan-speaking Monacan tribe. They often came into conflict with the Algonquian-speaking members of the Powhatan Confederacy, who were generally located to the east in the Virginia Tidewater area. In 1700 and after, French Huguenot settlers, who were Protestant, came to the area in the Virginia Colony to escape Catholic religious persecution in France. Most came from London, where they had resettled as refugees. Although the Crown had offered the French land in Lower Norfolk County, the governor of the colony and William Byrd offered them the village of Manakin Town, which had been abandoned by the Monacan. Byrd and the governor intended to use the French as a buffer settlement, and thought they would be easier to control apart from the English. The location was about above the head of navigation on the James River at what became Richmond. The French, many of whom were artisans and merchants, struggled to survive on the isolated frontier. The terrain was hilly and largely wooded, and shipping of farm products such as tobacco crops was not easy. The greater natural resource in the Midlothian area was coal, and the area was ultimately developed with coal mining and railroads. About west of the fall line of the James River at present-day Richmond is a basin of coal, which was one of the earliest mined in the Virginia Colony. Scots settlers with mining skills began to mine this resource in the 18th century. Many coal-related enterprises in the Midlothian area of Chesterfield County began early in the 18th century. =Coal mining= Grove Shaft The Village area of today's Midlothian started as a settlement of coal miners in the 18th century which were among the oldest mining shafts in the United States. In 1709, Midlothian produced the first commercially mined coal in the United States. Among other participants in the area's emerging coal business was Colonel Henry \\"Harry\\" Heth, a businessman who emigrated from England about 1759. He established offices at Norfolk and Manchester, where several generations of his family were also involved in the business. During the American Revolution, coal produced in the Midlothian coal pits supplied the cannon factory on the James River at Westham, upstream from Richmond; it produced shot and shells for the Continental Army. By the end of the War, developers shipped Chesterfield coal to Philadelphia, New York, Boston and to every city in Virginia. Commenting on the area's coal in his Notes on the State of Virginia (1781‚Äì82), then-Governor Thomas Jefferson stated: \\"The country on James river, from 15 to 20 miles above Richmond, and for several miles northward and southward, is replete with mineral coal of a very excellent quality.\\" During his presidency, Jefferson ordered coal from the Black Heath Mine in Midlothian for use in the White House. In 1989 the Chesterfield County Board of Supervisors approved a special area plan for Midlothian Mines Park, partly as a response to economic growth along Midlothian Turnpike resulting in population explosion. The core of the new \\"Special Area Plan\\" was based on the boundary of the plan of 1989 and extended westward to Route 288 as a natural boundary, and a map of the Midlothian community special area plan boundary was provided by John G. Ownby for the Richmond Times-Dispatch. Midlothian Mines Park, on the site of the first commercially-mined coal deposits in the Colony of Virginia, first opened for visitors in 2004. = Early roads, first turnpike, and railroads= While the Chesterfield Railroad was founded to move coal to Richmond 13 miles (21 km) to the East, the Richmond and Danville railroad replaced it in the 1850s. In 1804, a toll road, Manchester and Falling Creek Turnpike, was built from Manchester to Falling Creek to ease traffic on what is now Old Buckingham Road. It was graveled in 1807, making it Virginia's first hard-surfaced road. That road's descendant is known as Midlothian Turnpike, present-day U.S. Route 60. By 1824, an estimated 70 to 100 wagons, each of which was loaded with four or five tons of coal, made a daily trip on the turnpike, transporting to the docks near Manchester the million or more bushels (30,000 metric tons) of coal that were produced in Chesterfield County each year. The heavily loaded coal wagons tended to cut deep ruts in the turnpike, raising clouds of dust in summer and churning the road into mud in the rainy season. As there were few options for shunpiking, citizens whose faster buggies dawdled along behind the lumbering wagons urged the state legislature to do something about it--a canal, a better road, but something. The result was the Chesterfield Railroad, a mule- and gravity-powered line that connected the Midlothian coal mines with wharves located at Manchester, directly across from Richmond. Partially funded by the Virginia Board of Public Works, the railroad began operating in 1831, the first in the state. By 1852, the newer, steam-driven Richmond and Danville Railroad (R&D;) began operation to Coalfield Station, later renamed Midlothian; it quickly supplanted the slower Chesterfield Railroad. In a financial reorganization in 1894, the R&D; line through Midlothian became part of the Southern Railway system. It is now part of Norfolk Southern Railway. According to the 1895 Virginia atlas, the population of Midlothian was 375. =20th century: village becomes surrounded by suburban development= In the 20th century, coal mining declined. The area became less populated, remaining largely wooded with farms scattered along mostly rural and dirt roads. Gradually, post-war construction of the highway network and the growth of metropolitan Richmond brought subdivision residential development. When the Swift Creek Reservoir was created in 1965, the availability of water and sewer service accelerated residential growth, with Brandermill built in 1975. In 1988, an extension of the Powhite Parkway and widening of Midlothian Turnpike and Hull Street Road (U.S. Route 360) provided much-needed highway infrastructure. The area continued to attract new residents as farm and forest lands were redeveloped into residential subdivisions. The expansion of the area assigned to the Midlothian post office caused a much larger area to be assigned to have a \\"Midlothian\\" ZIP code on their address. As a result, many address locations within Chesterfield County that are far away from the original Midlothian village on U.S. Route 60 have \\"Midlothian\\" as their preferred place name. Chesterfield County's Midlothian Community Special Area Plan https://www.chesterfield.gov/915/Midlothian-Community-Special-Area-Plan defines the Midlothian community as roughly the area between the Village of Midlothian and Lucks Lane to the south.https://www.chesterfield.gov/DocumentCenter/View/2125/Midlothian- Community-Special-Area-Plan-Study-Area-Map-PDF =Historic landmarks= Chesterfield County Historic Landmarks near the Midlothian Village include: * Bellona Arsenal * Bethel Baptist Church * Bellgrade Plantation, 11500 West Huguenot Road * Dinwiddie County Pullman Car * Trabue's Tavern, 11940 Old Buckingham Road * Hallsboro Store * Hallsborough Tavern, 16300 Midlothian Turnpike * Ivymont Manor, 14111 Midlothian Turnpike (built in 1850) * Southside Speedway, 12800 Genito Road * Chesterfield Railroad, portion of roadbed (visible off Sturbridge Drive south of Midlothian Turnpike behind Pocono Green Shopping Center) =Chesterfield Museum= An exhibit on local mining history in the Chesterfield Museum includes a length of iron rail from the incline railway, the first in Virginia.

S. Class I railroad in central and southern Maine. It was chartered in 1856 and began operations in 1862. By 1884, Maine Central was the longest railroad in New England. Maine Central had expanded to when the United States Railroad Administration assumed control in 1917. The main line extended from South Portland, Maine, east to the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border with New Brunswick, and a Mountain Division extended west from Portland to Vermont and north into Quebec. The main line was double track from South Portland to Royal Junction, where it split into a \\"lower road\\" through Brunswick and Augusta and a \\"back road\\" through Lewiston which converged at Waterville into single track to Bangor and points east. Branch lines served the industrial center of Rumford, a resort hotel on Moosehead Lake, and coastal communities from Bath to Eastport. At the end of 1970 it operated of road on of track; that year it reported 950 million ton-miles of revenue freight. The Maine Central remained independent until 1981,The 470 Railroad Club, \\"Meet the Maine Central: The Pine Tree Route 1960-1981.\\" (Augusta: KJ Printing, 1981. when it was purchased by Guilford Transportation Industries and became part of what is now the Pan Am Railways network.  History  = Charter and creation = The Maine Central was created in 1862 through the merger of the Androscoggin and Kennebec Railroad and the Penobscot and Kennebec Railroad, resulting in a line from Danville (now Auburn) to Bangor. The line connected with the Grand Trunk Railway on its Portland-Chicago mainline at Danville and with the Bangor and Piscataquis Railroad in Bangor. As a result of its connection with the Grand Trunk, the Maine Central initially operated on a track gauge of known as \\"Canadian\\" or \\"Portland gauge\\". =Expansion= MEC Portland-Bangor 1867 Maine Central purchased the Portland and Kennebec Railroad, which ran from Portland to Augusta and was built to standard track gauge, since it connected with the Boston and Maine Railroad at Portland. By 1871, the Maine Central completed its conversion to standard gauge to facilitate interchange of cars. The MEC established rail service to the Penobscot Bay in 1871 by leasing (for fifty years) the then just-completed of track built by the Belfast and Moosehead Lake Railroad (B&ML;). The B&ML;'s grade ran the length of Waldo County from the port town of Belfast inland to Burnham Junction, where its single track connected with the MEC's Portland to Bangor mainline. Maine Central operated the road as its \\"Belfast Branch\\" for the next 55 years, but on June 30, 1925, MEC President Morris McDonald -- after repeated public denials -- gave the B&ML; (and the city of Belfast as its majority owner) the required six months notice that it would not renew its by then year-to-year lease when it expired on December 31, 1925. The reason eventually given was a net loss to the MEC on the Belfast Branch operations of $113,230 for the year 1924. The B&ML; took over operation of its road on January 1, 1926. It continued to exchange passengers and mail with the MEC at their jointly owned station at Burnham Junction until 1960 and freight interchange traffic until 2002. MEC locomotive crossing the Willey Brook Bridge in New Hampshire, c. 1906 In 1882, Maine Central leased the European and North American Railway (E&NA;) between Bangor and Vanceboro. In 1889, the Canadian Pacific Railway purchased trackage rights from the Maine Central on the portion of the former E&NA; from Mattawamkeag to Vanceboro. This Maine Central trackage formed part of the CPR's Montreal-Saint John mainline, upon completion of the International Railway of Maine. This line was an important rail route for Canadian war material heading to the port of Saint John for shipment overseas to Europe. In the months before the United States entered World War I, a German Army lieutenant attempted to blow up the railway bridge which crossed the St. Croix River at the international boundary. The lieutenant was arrested by Washington County sheriff Still Woodman, who later became chairman of Maine's Highway Department. Frankenstein Trestle in New Hampshire, c. 1920 In 1888, the Maine Central leased the Portland and Ogdensburg Railroad, which ran from Portland, through the White Mountains of New Hampshire via Crawford Notch, and into St. Johnsbury, Vermont, where it connected with the Southeastern Railway (owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway). Maine Central also operated a line southeast from Bangor along the coast through Machias to Calais, with branches to Bucksport, Bar Harbor and Eastport. Maine Central gained stock control of the Sandy River and Rangeley Lakes Railroad in 1911 and the Bridgton and Saco River Railroad in 1912, and operated both as narrow gauge branch lines.

It sold or abandoned lines such as the narrow gauge and logging branches, as well as its hotels, ferries and steamships. In the 1930s it began to change its locomotives from steam-powered to diesel-powered. Beginning in 1933, Maine Central entered into a \\"joint management\\" agreement with the Boston and Maine Railroad, with which it shared the Portland Terminal Company (a switching railroad in Portland). Faced with increased competition from cars, trucks and buses, Maine Central operated its last passenger train on September 5, 1960, and continued to reduce its freight business to reflect changing traffic. =Guilford= In 1980, the railroad was purchased by U.S. Filter Corporation and was then sold in 1981 to Guilford Transportation Industries, which later purchased the Boston and Maine Railroad (and thereby the Portland Terminal) in 1983 and the Delaware and Hudson Railway in 1984. Initially Guilford operated the system intact, although the system now permitted run-through traffic between central Maine and Boston. By the mid-1980s, Guilford began to rationalize its system and fully one-third of Maine Central's trackage was eliminated, including the \\"Mountain Division\\" from Portland to St. Johnsbury, Vermont; the \\"Rockland Branch\\" from Brunswick to Rockland; the \\"Calais Branch\\" from Bangor to Calais; and the \\"Lower Road\\" from Augusta to Brunswick. Guilford also forced many management and salary changes, resulting in a major strike against the company in 1986. Guilford Transportation also moved the Maine Central's headquarters from Portland to North Billerica, Massachusetts, in the mid-1980s. Former Somerset & Kennebec track over the Kennebec River near Augusta, Maine, July 8, 2006 One of the instigating factors which led to the labor strife at Guilford relates to a corporate reorganization at one of the company's former Maine Central properties. After the Calais Branch was abandoned, a small portion of trackage between Calais and Woodland remained in service to a pulp mill. It was joined to the rest of the North American rail network through a connection with the Canadian Pacific Railway at St. Stephen, New Brunswick, and operated through New Brunswick territory for several miles between Calais and Woodland. In order to avoid union agreements that the rest of the rail system was forced to follow, Guilford leased this operation to an obscure B&M; subsidiary known as Springfield Terminal Railway, because shortlines operate under different federal rules. Eventually, the corporate reorganization under Springfield Terminal would extend to the full extent of Guilford operations, and attempting to run a class 1 under short line rules would lead to years of union troubles. Maine Central boxcar in Guilford livery The former Maine Central locomotive shops in Waterville continue as Guilford's main repair shops. In the early 1990s, Guilford ended its practice of putting the full \\"Maine Central\\" name on the long hoods of MEC locomotives. Instead, the locomotives would wear the \\"Guilford Rail System\\" moniker, with small \\"MEC\\" reporting marks underneath the cab windows. On November 1, 2003, the Morristown and Erie Railway (M&E;) took over the former Maine Central \\"Lower Road\\" (main line) and Rockland Branch routes (aided by significant public funding from the state Department of Transportation). M&E; is operating these state-owned lines as the Maine Eastern Railroad. Prior to M&E;, the Rockland Branch had been operated by Safe Handling, and before that, the Maine Coast Railroad. Several railroad preservation and promotion groups are seeking to have the state-owned Calais Branch and Mountain Division routes reactivated for use by short line or tourist rail operations. Pan Am Railways A former Maine Central boxcar painted in the new Pan Am Railways livery in 2005 In the first quarter of 2006, Guilford Transportation Industries officially changed its name to Pan Am Systems, reflecting GTI's purchase of Pan American World Airways in 1998. The rail division of GTI changed its name from Guilford Rail System to Pan Am Railways (PAR). PAR began repainting locomotives in the sky-blue Pan Am colors shortly thereafter. Passenger operations Passenger station in Standish, Maine, c. 1907 The MEC passenger trains, often advertised as \\"M.C. R.R.\\" in the early 20th century, were essential to the sporting camp movement as early as the 1880s when people from Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Detroit would make their way north to hunt and fish in the western mountains and the Maine North Woods. From Portland's Union Station the MEC had unnamed trains to Bangor via Lewiston, to Bangor via Augusta, to Rockland, to Calais via Ellsworth, to Farmington and to Montreal via North Conway. Among the named trains operated by the MEC prior to ending passenger service in 1960 were the Bar Harbor Express, Down Easter, Flying Yankee, Gull, Katahdin, Kennebec, Mountaineer, Penobscot, Pine Tree, and Skipper. The Down Easter name is in use by Amtrak (now spelled Downeaster), which began passenger service between Boston and Brunswick, Maine in 2001.

He is the author of The Good Old Days': The Holocaust Through the Eyes of the Perpetrators and Bystanders first published in the English translation in 1991. Life and work Klee was first trained as a sanitary and heating technician. Afterwards, he caught up on his university entrance requirements and then studied theology and social education. As a journalist in the 1970s, he looked at socially excluded groups, such as the homeless, psychiatric patients and the disabled. During this period, he collaborated with Gusti Steiner, who laid the foundation for the federal German emancipatory movement of the disabled at that time. In 1997, he received the Geschwister-Scholl- Preis (\\"Scholl Siblings Prize\\") for his book, Auschwitz, die NS-Medizin und ihre Opfer (Auschwitz, Nazi Medicine and Their Victims).

The Prussian Navy was created in 1701 from the former Brandenburg Navy upon the dissolution of Brandenburg-Prussia, the personal union of Brandenburg and Prussia under the House of Hohenzollern, after the elevation of Frederick I from Duke of Prussia to King in Prussia. The Prussian Navy fought in several wars but was active mainly as a merchant navy throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, as Prussia's military consistently concentrated on the Prussian Army. The Prussian Navy was dissolved in 1867 when Prussia joined the North German Confederation, and its naval forces were absorbed into the North German Federal Navy. Brandenburg Navy The Electorate of Brandenburg, the predecessor of the Kingdom of Prussia, possessed its own naval forces from the 16th century onwards. Beginning around the year 1657, under Elector Frederick William (the \\"Great Elector\\"), these developed into an offensive naval force. The Elector designated navigation and commerce as the noblest undertakings of a state, and strove energetically to develop colonies overseas. Frederick William's descendants had, however, little interest in such overseas adventures and on developing their own naval power. His son Frederick I, from 1701 the King in Prussia, was glad to sell colonial possessions to the Netherlands. At the time of Brandenburg's elevation to the Kingdom of Prussia, the decline of the Brandenburg Navy had already begun; her end finally arrived with the sale of the colonies. The 18th century The Prussian kings of the 18th century had little interest in maintaining their own navy. Due to the state's continental position and the lack of easily defensible natural borders, Prussia had to concentrate its military preparations on the army. Besides this, the kingdom was able to rely on its many friendly connections with the neighboring naval powers of Denmark and the Netherlands. Frederick II (\\"the Great\\") took the view that Prussia should never seek to develop its own war fleet. The kingdom could never hope to equal the great fleets of Britain, France, the Dutch Republic, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, and Russia; with their few ships, the Prussians would always remain behind those great maritime nations. He believed that naval battles would only rarely decide a conflict and preferred having the best army in Europe rather than the worst fleet among the naval powers. Prussia nevertheless built up a small naval force of 13 makeshift warships during the Seven Years' War. This embryonic fleet lost the battle of Frisches Haff in September 1759 to a Swedish naval force. The Prussians lost all ships and as a consequence the Swedes occupied Usedom and Wollin. However, the ships were replaced already in 1760, and the new flotilla served until the end of the war in 1763.John B. Hattendorf, Deutschland und die See: Historische Wurzeln deutscher Seestreitkr√§fte bis 1815; in: Werner Rahn (Hrsg.), Deutsche Marinen im Wandel - Vom Symbol nationaler Einheit zum Instrument internationaler Sicherheitspolitik; M√ºnchen 2005, (German) Even so, the Prussian monarch wanted to take part in international maritime commerce and therefore founded several trading firms (with varying success). The Emden Company (officially, Royal Prussian Asiatic Company in Emden to Canton and China) operated four ships from 1751 to 1757. The Societ√© de Commerce maritime, founded in 1772, exists today as a foundation named the Preu√üische Seehandlung (roughly translated as Prussian Maritime Enterprise). The 19th century HMS Thetis, After the end of the Napoleonic Wars, Prussia slowly began to build its own small fleet for coastal defense. Again, more value was placed on the development of a merchant fleet than on a navy. In this connection, the Prussian Maritime Enterprise played a significant role. Its ships were armed to protect against pirates and flew the Prussian war ensign. This protective fleet existed until around 1850. One of the first to work for the development of a Prussian Navy was Prince Adalbert of Prussia. He had made a number of journeys abroad and recognized the value of a fleet to support commercial interests and to protect one's own navigation. During the Revolutionary era of 1848‚Äì1852, at the behest of the Frankfurt National Assembly, the prince was given the responsibility of reestablishing an Imperial Fleet (Reichsflotte) -- a mission which the revolutionary parliament had undertaken in the face of the war with Denmark. The German Confederation possessed practically no fleet of its own, but relied upon the allied powers of Great Britain, the Netherlands, and Denmark. During the First War of Schleswig of 1848‚Äì1851, the failure of this strategy became clear because Great Britain and the Netherlands remained neutral and Denmark became the enemy. Within a few days, the Danish Navy halted all German maritime trade in the North and Baltic Seas. The navy of Austria, Prussia's ally, lay in the Mediterranean and was able to intervene only later in the war. After the failure of the Revolutions of 1848, Adalbert was able to resume his plans for the establishment of a Prussian Navy. He began with the construction of warships and naval education and training. From the middle of the 1850s, one could find Prussian corvettes and frigates upon all the world's seas. Besides Prince Adalbert, other important figures of this early period were Prussian naval officers Karl Rudolf Brommy and Ludwig von Henk, who eventually became an admiral in the Imperial German Navy. At the same time, the first naval base was established on the North Sea. In the Jade Treaty (Jade-Vertrag) of 1853, the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg ceded to Prussia the so-called Jade District. Here, in the following years, arose the great naval port which received the name Wilhelmshaven in 1869. By this time, the Prussian Navy had already ceased to exist. After the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, the North German states had allied under Prussian leadership as the North German Confederation. Out of the Prussian Navy grew the North German Federal Navy, which after the Franco- Prussian War changed its name again to become the Imperial Navy of the new German Empire. Summary Even though Prussia consistently understood itself as a continental land power, its rise and fall were closely bound up with the destiny of the Brandenburger-Prussian-German naval forces. It was the ambitious appearance of the Great Elector who prepared Brandenburg's elevation as the Kingdom of Prussia. At that time, sea power and colonies were among the essential attributes of a European power; such attributes also obviously belonged to smaller and middling powers such as Denmark and the Netherlands. For 150 years Prussia ‚Äî unlike all other European powers ‚Äî declined to develop its own navy. Not until the 1848-1852 war against Denmark did Prussia recognize the necessity of having at least a minimal naval force to protect maritime interests. But after only 15 years, Prussia handed over its young naval forces to the rising centralized German state, an act which would have been unthinkable for the Prussian Army. The Navy was handed over first to the North German Confederation and in 1871, as the Imperial Navy, to the new German Empire. The naval preference of the last Prussian king, German Emperor Wilhelm II, prepared the end of the Prussian monarchy. The German naval buildup of the late 19th and early 20th centuries was one of the causes of World War I; and it was the mutinying sailors of the High Seas Fleet who forced the abdication of the Emperor during the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì1919.

It is highly autobiographical in nature, and centers on a young Russian landowner, Dimitry Sanin, who falls deliriously in love for the first time while visiting the German city of Frankfurt. Written during 1870 and 1871, when Turgenev was in his fifties, the novel is widely held as one of his greatest. Inception Despite its fictional overlay, Torrents of Spring is inspired by the events of Turgenev's life during his 1838-1841 tour of the German States. Although Fathers and Sons remains Turgenev's most famous novel, Torrents of Spring is significant in its revealing of the author's life, thoughts, and most intimate emotions. =Gemma= According to Turgenev's biographer Leonard Schapiro, the character of Gemma Roselli was inspired by an incident which took place while the future novelist was visiting Frankfurt in 1840. A young woman \\"of extraordinary beauty suddenly emerged from a tea-room to plead for help in reviving her brother, who had fainted.\\" But, unlike Gemma, the young woman was Jewish rather than Italian and, unlike Sanin, Turgenev left Frankfurt that same night without getting to know her further. =Maria Nikolaevna= The character of Maria Nikolaevna Polozova is believed to have had two models. The first was Turgenev's mother, Varvara Petrovna Turgeneva. According to Schapiro, Varvara Petrovna subjected her husband, her son, her servants, and her husband's serfs to systematic physical, emotional, and verbal abuse. All of this left permanent emotional scars upon her son and caused him to always gravitate towards abusive relationships. The second model is believed to have been Eleonora Petersen, the first wife of the poet Fyodor Tyutchev, with whom Turgenev \\"conceived some kind of romantic attachment\\" during his 1838 voyage from St. Petersburg to L√ºbeck. At the time, Eleonora was \\"returning to Munich with her children\\" and \\"died the following year\\". According to Schapiro, Turgenev's \\"correspondence with his mother suggests that he was in love with\\" Eleonora, \\"or fancied himself to be so, but that is as much as we know.\\" According to Schapiro, there are many indications that Torrents of Spring had \\"some deep personal meaning\\" for Turgenev. In a letter to his French publisher Hetzel, the author wrote of Maria Nikolaevna, \\"This she-devil seduced me as she seduced that nit-witted Sanin.\\" In response to a letter, criticizing the novel, from the niece of Gustave Flaubert, Turgenev expressed agreement that the second half of the novel, \\"was not very necessary\\", but explained, \\"I allowed myself to be carried away by memories.\\" Most revealingly, Turgenev told Isaac Pavlovski, \\"The entire novel is true. I personally lived and felt it. It is my own history.\\" () Composition Turgenev likely began work on what became Torrents of Spring in 1870. Though originally planned as a short story it had expanded to novel length by the time it was finally completed in late 1871. It first saw publication in the January 1872 edition of the Vestnik Evropy (Herald of Europe), the major liberal magazine of late nineteenth century Russia.Turgenev, Ivan Sergeevich and Leonard Schapiro (1980). Spring Torrents. Harmondsworth, Middlesex, England: Penguin Books, 184-185. Though the novel was somewhat unusual for Turgenev in that it was nearly devoid of political or social themes, it enjoyed a great success from its first appearance. The issue of the Vestnik Evropy in which it was first published had to be reprinted, an unprecedented event in the history of Russian periodicals.Magarshack, David (1954). Turgenev. London: Faber and Faber L.T.D, 275. Plot The story opens with a middle-aged Dmitry Sanin rummaging through the papers in his study when he comes across a small cross set with garnets, which sends his thoughts back thirty years to 1840. In the summer of 1840, a twenty-two-year-old Sanin, arrives in Frankfurt en route home to Russia from Italy at the culmination of a European tour. During his one-day layover he visits a confectioner's shop where he is rushed upon by a beautiful young woman who emerges frantic from the back room. She is Gemma Roselli, the daughter of the shop's proprietress, Leonora Roselli. Gemma implores Sanin to help her younger brother who has passed out and seems to have stopped breathing. Thanks to Sanin's aid, the boy ‚Äì whose name is Emilio ‚Äì emerges from his faint. Grateful for his assistance, Gemma invites Sanin to return to the shop later in the evening to enjoy a cup of chocolate with the family. Later that evening, Sanin formally meets the members of the Roselli household. These include the matriarch, Leonora (or Lenore) Roselli, her daughter Gemma, her son Emilio (or Emile), and the family friend Pantaleone, a rather irascible old man and retired opera singer. Over conversation that evening Sanin grows increasingly enamoured with the young Gemma, while the Roselli family is also well-taken by the young, handsome, educated, and gracious Russian. Sanin so enjoys his evening that he forgets about his plans to take the diligence on to Berlin that night and so misses it. At the end of the evening Leonora Roselli invites Sanin to return the next day. Sanin is also disappointed to learn that Gemma is in fact engaged to a young German named Karl Kl√ºber. The following day Sanin is visited in his room by Gemma's fianc√©, Karl Kl√ºber, and the still recovering Emilio. Kl√ºber thanks Sanin for his help in assisting Gemma and resuscitating Emilio and invites Sanin on an excursion he has arranged the following day to Soden. That evening Sanin enjoys another enjoyable time with the Rosellis and becomes yet more taken by the charm and beauty of Gemma. The next morning Sanin joins Kl√ºber, Gemma, and Emilio for the trip to Soden. During lunch at an inn the party shares the restaurant with a group of drinking soldiers. A drunken officer among their number approaches Gemma and rather brazenly declares her beauty. Gemma is infuriated by this behaviour, and Kl√ºber, also angry, orders the small party to leave the dining room. The enraged Sanin on the other hand, feels compelled to confront the soldiers, and going over declares the offending officer an insolent cur and his behaviour unbecoming an officer. Sanin also leaves his calling card, anticipating he might be challenged to a duel for his public words. The following morning a friend of the offending German officer arrives early at Sanin's door demanding either an apology or satisfaction on behalf of his friend. Sanin scoffs at any notion of apologizing and so a duel is arranged for the following day near Hanau. For his second Sanin invites the old man Pantaleone, who accepts and is impressed by the nobility and honour of the young Russian, seeing in him a fellow ‚Äúgalant'uomo.‚Äù Sanin keeps the planned duel a secret between himself and Pantaleone, though the latter reveals it to Emilio. Departing the Roselli home that night, Sanin has a brief encounter with Gemma, who calls him over to a darkened window when she spots him leaving along the street. As they whisper to one another there is a sudden gust of wind that sends Sanin's hat flying and pushes the two together. Sanin later feels this was the moment he began to fall in love with Gemma. The next morning on the way to Hanau, Pantaleone's earlier bravado has largely faded. Sanin does his best to embolden him. At the subsequent duel Sanin gets off the first shot but misses, while his opponent, the Baron von D√∂nhof, shoots deliberately into the air. The officer, feeling his honor has been satisfied, then apologizes for his drunken behavior, an apology Sanin readily accepts. Sanin feels somewhat disgusted afterward that the whole duel was a farce. Pantaleone, however, is overjoyed with the outcome. Returning to Frankfurt with Pantaleone and Emilio (who had secretly followed him to the duel site), Sanin discovers that Emilio has in turn told Gemma about the duel. Sanin is a little put off by the indiscretion of this pair of chatterboxes, but cannot be angry. Back in Frankfurt, Sanin soon learns from a distraught Frau Lenore that Gemma has cancelled her engagement to Klaus for no apparent reason than that he did not defend her honor sufficiently at the inn. Frau Lenore is frantic at the idea of the scandal this will cause and Sanin promises to talk to Gemma and convince her to reconsider. In Sanin's subsequent talk with Gemma, she professes her love for him but tells him that for his sake she will reconsider her estrangement from Klaus. Astonished and overcome by her confession of love, Sanin then urges her to do nothing just yet. Sanin then returns to his rooms to orient himself to this new development and there pens his own declaration of love to Gemma and gives it to Emilio to deliver. Gemma sends her response telling Sanin not to come to their home the next day, without providing an exact reason. So the next day Sanin spends with a delighted Emilio in the countryside and that evening returns to his rooms to find a note from Gemma asking him to meet her in a quiet public garden of Frankfurt at seven the next morning. This Sanin does and the two declare their love for one another and Sanin proposes marriage. Frau Lenore is shocked and hurt to learn of Sanin's love and thinks Sanin a hypocrite and a cunning seducer. But Sanin demands to meet with the disconsolate Frau Lenore and eventually convinces her of his noble intentions as well as his noble birth and his income sufficient to care for Gemma. Sanin decides he must sell his small estate near Tula in Russia in order to pay for his planned nuptials and settling down with Gemma. By chance, he meets in the street the next day an old schoolmate of his, Hippolyte Sidorovich Polozov, who has come to Frankfurt from nearby Wiesbaden to do some shopping for his wealthy wife, Maria Nikolaevna. This seems to confirm Sanin's notion that a lucky star follows lovers, for Maria is from the same region near Tula as himself, and her wealth might make her a likely prospect to buy his estate, thus saving him a journey home to Russia. Sanin proposes this notion to the phlegmatic Hippolyte, who informs Sanin that he is never involved in his wife's financial decisions but that Sanin is welcome to return to Wiesbaden with him to present the idea to Maria. Sanin agrees though it will pain him to separate from Gemma. With Gemma and Frau Lenore's blessing, Sanin then makes the journey to Wiesbaden. In Wiesbaden, Sanin soon meets the mysterious Maria Nikolaevna Polozov, and though conscious of her beauty is all business as Gemma still owns his heart. Maria asks about Sanin's love and upon hearing he is engaged to a confectionery professes herself impressed by Sanin, whom she calls ‚Äúa man who is not afraid to love‚Äù despite the differences in class between himself and Gemma. Maria informs him that she herself is the daughter of a peasant and indeed speaks to Sanin in the Russian of the common classes rather than high Russian or French. Maria is interested in purchasing Sanin's estate but asks Sanin to give her two days to contemplate it. In the days that follow, and seemingly against his own will and inclination, Sanin finds himself increasingly obsessed by the curious Maria Nikolaevna as she intrudes herself upon his thoughts. In Wiesbaden Sanin also discovers the presence of none other than the Baron von D√∂nhof, who seems also to be smitten by Maria Nikolaevna. Maria invites Sanin to the theater where they share a private box. Bored with the play they retreat further into the box where Maria confesses what she cherished more than anything else is freedom, and thus her marriage to the rather witless Polozov, a marriage in which she can have absolute freedom. Before parting company for the evening Dmitry agrees to go riding with Maria the following day, in what he thinks will be their last meeting before he returns to Frankfurt and she proceeds to Paris. The next morning the pair heads off on their ride in the countryside accompanied only by a single groom, whom Maria soon dispatches to a local inn to wile away the afternoon, leaving her and Sanin to themselves. The seemingly fearless Maria leads Sanin on a vigorous ride across the countryside that leaves them invigorated and their horses breathless. When a thunderstorm moves in Maria leads them both to an abandoned cottage where they make love. After their return to Wiesbaden, Sanin is eaten with remorse. When Maria greets her husband in his presence Sanin detects an uncharacteristic look of irritation on Polozov's face and it is revealed that he and his wife Maria had a wager on whether she could seduce Sanin, a wager Polozov has now lost. Maria asks Sanin if he is to return to Frankfurt or accompany them to Paris. His response is that he will follow Maria until she drives him away. His humiliation is complete. The story then reverts to the present, some thirty years after these events. Sanin is again in his study, contemplating the garnet cross (previously revealed to have belonged to Gemma); and Sanin is again eaten with remorse, and recalls all the bitter and shameful memories he felt after the events of Wiesbaden, such as how he sent a tearful letter to Gemma that went unanswered, how he sent a groom of the Polozovs to fetch his things in Frankfurt, and even how the elderly Pantaleone, accompanied by Emilio, came to Wiesbaden to curse him. Most of all he recounts his embittered and shame- ridden life afterwards, in which he followed Maria until he was thrown off like an old rag and has since remained unmarried and childless. Now in his fifties, he decides to return to Frankfurt to track down his old love but once there finds no trace of the former Roselli home nor anyone who has even heard of them, though he does discover that Karl Kl√ºber though initially very successful eventually went bankrupt and died in prison. Finally, however, he finds a now retired Baron von D√∂nhof, who tells him that the Rosellis had long since emigrated to America. Through the conversation of von D√∂nhof and Sanin it is also revealed that Maria Nikolaevna died ‚Äúlong ago.‚Äù With the help of a friend of von D√∂nhof, Sanin obtains Gemma's address in New York, where she is married to a certain Slocum. Sanin immediately writes to her, describing the events of his life and begging that she respond as a sign that she forgives him. He vows to remain in Frankfurt at the same inn he stayed in thirty years ago until he receives her response. Eventually she does write and forgives him, while telling him about the lives of her family (she now has five children) and wishing him happiness, while also expressing the joy it would give her to see him again, though she doesn't think it likely. She encloses a picture of her eldest daughter, Marianna, who is engaged to be married. Sanin anonymously sends Marianna a wedding gift: Gemma's garnet cross, now set in a necklace of magnificent pearls. The novel ends with the author noting rumors that Sanin, who is quite financially well off, is planning to sell off his property and move to America.

Various points are offered as the beginning for the latter era, though it is most often regarded as dating from the foundation of the Twenty-Sixth Dynasty by Psamtik I in 664 BC, following the expulsion of the Nubian Kushite rulers of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty by the Assyrians under King Assurbanipal. The concept of a \\"Third Intermediate Period\\" was coined in 1978 by British Egyptologist Kenneth Kitchen. The period was one of decline and political instability, coinciding with the Late Bronze Age collapse of civilizations in the ancient Near East and Eastern Mediterranean (including the Greek Dark Ages). It was marked by division of the state for much of the period and conquest and rule by foreigners. History = Twenty-first Dynasty = The period of the Twenty-first Dynasty is characterized by the country's fracturing kingship. Already during Ramesses XI's reign, the Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt was losing its grip on the city of Thebes, whose priests were becoming increasingly powerful. After his death, his successor, Smendes I, ruled from the city of Tanis, but was mostly active only in Lower Egypt, which he controlled. Meanwhile, the High Priests of Amun at Thebes ruled Middle and Upper Egypt in all but name.Kenneth A. Kitchen, The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt (1100‚Äì650 BC), 3rd edition, 1986, Warminster: Aris & Phillips Ltd, p.531 However, this division was less significant than it seems, since both the priests and pharaohs came from the same family. = Twenty-second and Twenty-third Dynasty = The country was firmly reunited by the Twenty-second Dynasty founded by Shoshenq I in 945 BC (or 943 BC), who descended from Meshwesh immigrants, originally from Ancient Libya. This brought stability to the country for well over a century, but after the reign of Osorkon II, particularly, the country had effectively split into two states, with Shoshenq III of the Twenty-second Dynasty controlling Lower Egypt by 818 BC while Takelot II and his son Osorkon (the future Osorkon III) ruled Middle and Upper Egypt. In Thebes, a civil war engulfed the city, pitting the forces of Pedubast I, who had proclaimed himself pharaoh, against the existing line of Takelot II/Osorkon B. The two factions squabbled continuously and the conflict was only resolved in Year 39 of Shoshenq III when Osorkon B comprehensively defeated his enemies. He proceeded to found the Upper Egyptian Libyan Twenty-third Dynasty of Osorkon III - Takelot III - Rudamun, but this kingdom quickly fragmented after Rudamun's death, with the rise of local city states under kings such as Peftjaubast of Herakleopolis, Nimlot of Hermopolis, and Ini at Thebes. = Twenty-fourth Dynasty = The Nubian kingdom to the south took full advantage of this division and the ensuing political instability. Prior to Piye's Year 20 campaign into Egypt, the previous Nubian ruler - Kashta - had already extended his kingdom's influence into Thebes when he compelled Shepenupet, the serving Divine Adoratice of Amun and Takelot III's sister, to adopt his own daughter Amenirdis, to be her successor. Then, 20 years later, around 732 BC his successor, Piye, marched north and defeated the combined might of several native Egyptian rulers: Peftjaubast, Osorkon IV of Tanis, Iuput II of Leontopolis and Tefnakht of Sais. = Twenty-fifth Dynasty = 25th Dynasty Piye established the Twenty-fifth Dynasty and appointed the defeated rulers as his provincial governors. He was succeeded first by his brother, Shabaka, and then by his two sons Shebitku and Taharqa. The reunited Nile valley empire of the 25th Dynasty was as large as it had been since the New Kingdom. Pharaohs of the dynasty, among them Taharqa, built or restored temples and monuments throughout the Nile valley, including at Memphis, Karnak, Kawa, and Jebel Barkal. The 25th Dynasty ended with its rulers retreating to their spiritual homeland at Napata. It was there (at El- Kurru and Nuri) that all 25th Dynasty pharaohs were buried under the first pyramids to be constructed in the Nile valley in hundreds of years. The Napatan dynasty led to the Kingdom of Kush, which flourished in Napata and Meroe until at least the 2nd century AD. The international prestige of Egypt had declined considerably by this time. The country's international allies had fallen firmly into the sphere of influence of Assyria and from about 700 BC the question became when, not if, there would be war between the two states as Esarhaddon had realised that a conquest of Lower Egypt was necessary to protect Assyrians interests in the Levant. Despite Egypt's size and wealth, Assyria had a greater supply of timber, while Egypt had a chronic shortage, allowing Assyria to produce more charcoal needed for iron-smelting and thus giving Assyria a greater supply of iron weaponry. This disparity became critical during the Assyrian invasions of Egypt over the period 670-663 BC. Consequently, pharaoh Taharqa's reign, and that of his successor Tantamani, were filled with constant conflict with the Assyrians. In 664 BC the Assyrians delivered a mortal blow, sacking Thebes and Memphis. Following these events, and starting with Atlanersa, no Kushite ruler would ever rule over Egypt again. = End of the Third Intermediate Period = Upper Egypt remained for a time under the rule of Taharqa and Tantamani, whilst Lower Egypt was ruled from 664 BC by the nascent 26th Dynasty, client kings established by the Assyrians. In 663 BC, Tantamani launched a full-scale invasion of Lower Egypt, taking Memphis in April of this year, killing Necho I of Sais in the process as Necho had remained loyal to Ashurbanipal. Tantamani barely had the time to receive the submission of some Delta kinglets and expel the remaining Assyrians that a large army led by Ashurbanipal and Necho's son Psamtik I came back. Tantamani was defeated north of Memphis and Thebes was thoroughly sacked shortly after. The Kushite king withdrew to Nubia while the Assyrian influence in Upper Egypt quickly waned. Permanently weakened by the sack, Thebes peacefully submitted itself to Psamtik's fleet in 656 BC. To affirm his authority, Psamtik placed his daughter in position to be the future Divine Adoratrice of Amun, thereby also submitting the priesthood of Amun and effectively uniting Egypt. Tantamani's successor Atlanersa was in no position to attempt a reconquest of Egypt as Psamtik also secured the southern border at Elephantine and may even have sent a military campaign to Napata. Concurrently, Psamtik managed to free himself from the Assyrian vassalage while remaining on good terms with Ashurbanipal, possibly owing to an ongoing rebellion in Babylon. By doing so, hebrought increased stability to the country during his 54-year reign from the city of Sais. Four successive Saite kings continued guiding Egypt into another period of peace and prosperity from 610 to 525 BC. Unfortunately for this dynasty, a new power was growing in the Near East - the Achaemenid Empire of Persia. Pharaoh Psamtik III had succeeded his father Ahmose II for only 6 months before he had to face the Persian Empire at Pelusium. The Persians had already taken Babylon and Egypt was no match for them. Psamtik III was defeated and briefly escaped to Memphis, before he was ultimately imprisoned and, later, executed at Susa, the capital of the Persian king Cambyses, who now assumed the formal title of Pharaoh.  Historiography  The historiography of this period is disputed for a variety of reasons. Firstly, there is a dispute about the utility of a very artificial term that covers an extremely long and complicated period of Egyptian history. The Third Intermediate Period includes long periods of stability as well as chronic instability and civil conflict: its very name rather clouds this fact. Secondly, there are significant problems of chronology stemming from several areas: first, there are the difficulties in dating that are common to all of Egyptian chronology but these are compounded due to synchronisms with Biblical archaeology that also contain heavily disputed dates. James et al. argued contra Kitchen that the period lasted less than 200 years - starting later than 850 BC but ending at the conventional date - as the five dynasties had many years of overlap. Finally, some Egyptologists and biblical scholars, such as Kenneth Kitchen and David Rohl have novel or controversial theories about the family relationships of the dynasties comprising the period.

Development of the hot blast David Thomas was born in Cadoxton, near Neath. He went to school at nearby Alltwen and at Neath, and worked on his father's farm before going into the iron industry. He married Elizabeth Hopkins in 1817. As an adult, he was widely regarded as one of the foremost ironmasters in the United Kingdom. It was while employed at the Yniscedwyn Works, in Ystradgynlais in the Swansea Valley, that he devised the process which would advance the Industrial Revolution. On February 5, 1837, Thomas used a hot blast to smelt iron ore and anthracite coal. The result was an easy method to produce anthracite iron, which revolutionized industry in the Swansea Valley. This type of iron had been patented by Edward Martin of Morriston, Wales in 1804. In 1839 he relocated to Pennsylvania, where the owners of the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company in Lehigh County wanted Thomas to build a furnace for the production of anthracite iron. The Lehigh Valley region, being rich in both anthracite coal and iron ore, was the perfect setting for Thomas's creation. Emigration to Pennsylvania Thomas and his son, Samuel, walked into the infant community of Catasauqua, Pennsylvania on the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company's towpath on July 9, 1839. Less than one year later, on July 4, 1840, the first successful anthracite iron furnace in the United States began operation. Thomas's iron works was extremely successful, even though the iron industry in the rest of the Lehigh Valley had begun to decline. The company was incorporated in 1839 as the Lehigh Crane Iron Company, and in 1872 the name was changed to the Crane Iron Company. By that time the community was no longer known as Craneville, but as Catasauqua; Thomas had named both his company and the town in which he founded it after his former employer in Wales. Iron produced at the Crane Iron Company was used in a number of products, many of which were made elsewhere in Catasauqua. The neighbouring company of John Fritz's Iron Foundry used Crane iron to build the first American-made cast-iron construction columns, while the nearby Davies and Thomas Foundry turned Crane iron into pipes and tunnel tubes. Among the still-existing structures which were created using Crane iron are the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels in New York City. Thomas's industry helped the small town to become quite prosperous, and he himself became a wealthy landowner. Philanthropy and honors Thomas's wealth and generosity with it endeared him to his neighbors. He and his wife, Elizabeth, were known as \\"the father and mother of Catasauqua\\", and frequently addressed as Mother and Father Thomas. A devout Presbyterian, Thomas founded the first church in the borough of Catasauqua, in which residents still worship. He installed its first public water system, founded its first fire company, and served as its first burgess. He provided a number of neat, attractive homes for his employees, many of which are still standing today. Additional accolades were presented to \\"Father Thomas\\" for his transformational ideas and vision. He was named the first president of the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers (then known as the American Society of Metallurgy), and was one of the founders of the American Association of Industrial Engineers. Death and legacy David Thomas died from pneumonia in Catasauqua on June 20, 1882. He, his wife Elizabeth, and generations of their descendants are all buried in the Thomas family vault, a sort of underground mausoleum at Fairview Cemetery in West Catasauqua. The Thomas family mansion, located on Second Street in Catasauqua, is still standing, though its interior has since been divided into apartments. In 1898, Leonard Peckitt took the reins as president of the Crane Iron Company. He proceeded to purchase a number of other companies in the region, uniting them all under the incorporation of the Empire Steel and Iron Company. Though Peckitt was a shrewd businessman, he could not hide forever the fact that the 20th century brought changes to the iron industry, and that the company was beginning to lose money. The last furnace at the Crane Iron Company ceased operation in 1921; by 1935, most of the plant had been demolished, and little remains of the company's plant today. What does still exist is in the possession of the borough of Catasauqua, which is currently working to transform it into a shopping and dining destination.Catasauqua.org: Our vision for the Iron Works Sources *Images of America: Catasauqua and North Catasauqua by Martha Capwell Fox (Arcadia Publishing 2002) *WelshDragon.net: Historical Wales Timeline *Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company *Welsh Biography Online References Foundrymen Ironmasters British industrialists Welsh industrialists American manufacturing businesspeople People from Swansea People from Lehigh County, Pennsylvania British emigrants to the United States Welsh emigrants to the United States 1794 births 1882 deaths ","title":"David Thomas (industrialist)"},{"id":"1362975","text":"Gregory Alan Berger (born December 10, 1950) is an American voice actor, known for his roles as Jecht from Final Fantasy X and the Dissidia Final Fantasy games, Grimlock from The Transformers, Mysterio and Kraven the Hunter from Spider-Man, Odie from various Garfield animated media, Cornfed Pig from Duckman, Bill Licking from The Angry Beavers, Agent Kay from Men in Black: The Series, The Gromble from Aaahh!!!

It was performed in 1606, and published in 1607 by George Eld. A vivid and often violent portrayal of lust and ambition in an Italian court, the play typifies the satiric tone and cynicism of much Jacobean tragedy. The play fell out of favour at some point before the restoration of the theaters in 1660; however, it experienced a revival in the twentieth century among directors and playgoers who appreciated its affinity with the temper of modern times.Wells, p. 106 Characters *Vindice, the revenger, frequently disguised as Piato (both the 1607 and 1608 printings render his name variously as Vendici, Vindici and Vindice, with the latter spelling most frequent). *Hippolito, Vindice's brother, sometimes called Carlo *Castiza, their sister *Gratiana, a widow, and mother of Vindice, Hippolito, and Castiza *The Duke *The Duchess, the duke's second wife *Lussurioso, the duke's son from an earlier marriage, and his heir *Spurio, the duke's second son, a bastard *Ambitioso, the duchess's eldest son *Supervacuo, the duchess's middle son *Junior Brother, the duchess's third son *Antonio, a discontented lord at the Duke's court *Antonio's wife, raped by Junior Brother *Piero, a discontented lord at the Duke's court *Nobles, allies of Lussurioso *Lords, followers of Antonio *The Duke's gentlemen *Two Judges *Spurio's two Servants *Four Officers *A Prison-Keeper *Dondolo, Castiza's servant *Nencio and Sordido, Lussurioso's servants *Ambitioso's henchman Synopsis The play is set in an unnamed Italian court. =Act I= Vindice broods over his fiancee's recent death and his desire for revenge on the lustful Duke for poisoning his beloved nine years before. Vindice's brother Hippolito brings news: Lussurioso, the Duke's heir by his first marriage, has asked him if he can find a procurer to obtain a young virgin he lusts after. The brothers decide that Vindice will undertake this role in disguise, to give an opportunity for their revenge. Meanwhile, Lord Antonio's wife has been raped by the new Duchess's youngest son Junior. He brazenly admits his guilt, even joking about it, but to widespread surprise the Duke suspends the proceedings and defers the court's judgement. The Duchess's other sons, Ambitioso and Supervacuo, whisper a promise to have him freed; the Duchess vows to be unfaithful to the Duke. Spurio, the Duke's bastard son, agrees to be her lover but when alone, declares he hates her and her sons as intensely as he hates the Duke and Lussurioso. Vindice, disguised as \\"Piato,\\" is accepted by Lussurioso, who tells him that the virgin he desires is Hippolito's sister, Castiza; and he predicts her mother will accept a bribe and be a 'bawd to her own daughter'. Vindice, alone, vows to kill Lussurioso, but decides meanwhile to stay in disguise and put his mother and sister to the test by tempting them. Antonio's wife commits suicide; Antonio displays her dead body to fellow mourners and Hippolito swears all those present to revenge her death. =Act II= Vindice, disguised as \\"Piato,\\" tests the virtue of his sister and mother. Castiza proves resolute but his mother yields to an offer of gold. Vindice gives Lussurioso the false news that Castiza's resistance to his advance is crumbling. Lussurioso resolves he must sleep with her that same night. Hippolito and Vindice, by chance, overhear a servant tell Spurio that Lussurioso intends to sleep with Castiza \\"within this hour.\\" Spurio rushes away to kill Lussurioso in flagrante delicto. A moment later Lussurioso himself enters, on his way to Castiza, but Vindice deceptively warns him that Spurio is bedding the Duchess. Angered, Lussurioso rushes off to find Spurio and bursts into the ducal bedchamber, only to find his father lawfully in bed with the Duchess. Lussurioso is arrested for attempting treason; in the excitement, Hippolito and Vindice discreetly withdraw. The Duke, seeing through Ambitioso and Supervacuo's pretended reluctance to see Lussurioso executed, dispatches them with a warrant for the execution of his son \\"ere many days,\\" but once they have gone he gives a countermanding order for his son's release. =Act III= Ambitioso and Supervacuo set off directly to the prison to order the instant execution of Lussurioso. Before they arrive however (and unknown to them) the Duke's countermanding order is obeyed and Lussurioso is freed. Ambitioso and Supervacuo arrive at the prison and present the Duke's first warrant to execute, in their words, \\"our brother the duke's son.\\" The guards misinterpret these words, taking instead the youngest son out to instant execution. Meanwhile, Vindice is hired again as a pander ‚Äì this time by the Duke himself. His plan is to procure the Duke an unusual lady ‚Äì a richly clothed effigy, her head, the skull of Vindice's beloved, is covered with poison. The meeting is in a dark and secret place near where the Duchess has arranged a meeting with Spurio. The Duke is poisoned by kissing the supposed lady and is subsequently stabbed by Vindice after being forced to watch the Duchess betray him with Spurio. Ambitioso and Supervacuo, still confident that Lussurioso has been executed, both look forward to succeeding the throne in his place. A freshly severed head is brought in from prison. Assuming it is Lussurioso's, they are gloating over it when Lussurioso himself arrives, alive. They realize to their dismay that the head is the youngest son's. =Act IV= Lussurioso tells Hippolito he wants to get rid of \\"Piato,\\" and asks if Vindice (of whom he knows only by report) would replace him. Hippolito assents, realizing that Lussurioso would not recognize Vindice without a disguise. Vindice gets his new mission ‚Äì to kill \\"Piato\\". Hippolito and Vindice take the corpse of the Duke and dress it in \\"Piato's\\" clothes, so when the corpse is found it will be assumed that \\"Piato\\" murdered the Duke then switched clothes with him to escape. Vindice and Hippolito confront Gratiana for her earlier willingness to prostitute Castiza bringing her to repentance. =Act V= The scheme with the Duke's corpse is successful and the Duke's death becomes public knowledge. Vindice and Hippolito lead a group of conspirators which, shortly after the installation of Lussurioso as Duke, kills the new Duke and his supporters. A second group of murderers including Supervacuo, Ambitioso, and Spurio then arrives; they discover their intended victims already dead, and then turn on and kill each other. The dying Lussurioso is unable to expose Vindice's treacheries to Lord Antonio. Exhilarated by his success and revenge, Vindice confides in Antonio that he and his brother murdered the old Duke. Antonio, appalled, condemns them to execution. Vindice, in a final speech, accepts his death. Context The Revenger's Tragedy belongs to the second generation of English revenge plays. It keeps the basic Senecan design brought to English drama by Thomas Kyd: a young man is driven to avenge an elder's death (in this case it's a lover, Gloriana, instead), which was caused by the villainy of a powerful older man; the avenger schemes to effect his revenge, often by morally questionable means; he finally succeeds in a bloodbath that costs him his own life as well. However, the author's tone and treatment are markedly different from the standard Elizabethan treatment in ways that can be traced to both literary and historical causes. Already by 1606, the enthusiasm that accompanied James I's assumption of the English throne had begun to give way to the beginnings of dissatisfaction with the perception of corruption in his court. The new prominence of tragedies that involved courtly intrigues seems to have been partly influenced by this dissatisfaction. This trend towards court-based tragedy was contemporary with a change in dramatic tastes toward the satiric and cynical, beginning before the death of Elizabeth I but becoming ascendant in the few years following. The episcopal ban on verse satire in 1599 appears to have impelled some poets to a career in dramaturgy;Campbell, 3 writers such as John Marston and Thomas Middleton brought to the theatres a lively sense of human frailty and hypocrisy. They found fertile ground in the newly revived children's companies, the Blackfriars Children and Paul's Children;Harbage, passim these indoor venues attracted a more sophisticated crowd than that which frequented the theatres in the suburbs. While The Revenger's Tragedy was apparently performed by an adult company at the Globe Theatre, its bizarre violence and vicious satire mark it as influenced by the dramaturgy of the private playhouses. Analysis and criticism =Genre= Ignored for many years, and viewed by some critics as the product of a cynical, embittered mind,Ribner, Irving (1962) Jacobean Tragedy: the quest for moral order. London: Methuen; New York, Barnes & Noble; p. 75 (Refers to several other authors.) The Revenger's Tragedy was rediscovered and often performed as a black comedy during the 20th century. The approach of these revivals mirrors shifting views of the play on the part of literary critics. One of the most influential 20th-century readings of the play is by the critic Jonathan Dollimore, which claims that the play is essentially a form of radical parody that challenges orthodox Jacobean beliefs about Providence and patriarchy.Dollimore, Jonathan (1984) Radical Tragedy: Religion, Ideology and Power in the Drama of Shakespeare and his Contemporaries. Chicago: University of Chicago Press; pp. 139‚Äì50. Dollimore asserts the play is best understood as \\"subversive black camp\\" insofar as it \\"celebrates the artificial and the delinquent; it delights in a play full of innuendo, perversity and subversion ... through parody it declares itself radically skeptical of ideological policing though not independent of the social reality which such skepticism simultaneously discloses\\".Dollimore, p. 149. In Dollimore's view, earlier critical approaches, which either emphasise the play's absolute decadence or find an ultimate affirmation of traditional morality in the play, are insufficient because they fail to take into account this vital strain of social and ideological critique running throughout the tragedy. =Themes and motifs= Gender The Duchess, Castiza, and Gratiana are the only three female characters found in the play. Gratiana (\\"grace\\"), Vindice's mother, exemplifies female frailty. This is such a stereotyped role that it discourages looking at her circumstance in the play, but because she is a widow it could be assumed to include financial insecurity, which could help explain her susceptibility to bribery. Her daughter also has an exemplary name, Castiza (\\"chastity\\"), as if to fall in line with the conventions of the Morality drama, rather than the more individualized characterization seen in their counterparts in Hamlet, Gertrude and Ophelia. Due to the ironic and witty matter in which The Revenger's Tragedy handles received conventions, however, it is an open question as to how far the presentation of gender in the play is meant to be accepted as conventional, or instead as parody. The play is in accordance with the medieval tradition of Christian Complaint, and Elizabethan satire, in presenting sexuality mainly as symptomatic of general corruption. Even though Gratiana is the mother of a decent, strong-minded daughter, she finds herself acting as a bawd. This personality-split is then repeated, in an episode exactly reversing the pattern, by her ironic, intelligent daughter.Gibbons, B. (2008). The Revenger's Tragedy (3rd ed., pp. Xxiii-xxiv). London: Bloomsbury Methuen Drama. Michael Neill notes that the name \\"Spurio\\" derives from the Latin term \\"spurius\\" which does not mean just any illegitimate offspring, but \\"one born from a noble but spouseless mother to an unknown or plebeian father.\\" These children, who could not take the paternal name, were called \\"spurius\\" because they sprang in effect from the mother alone‚Äîthe word itself deriving from \\"spurium,\\" an ancient term for the female genitalia. As Thomas Laqueur puts it, \\"while the legitimate child is from the froth of the father, the illegitimate child is from the seed of the mother's genitals, as if the father did not exist.\\" The idea of Spurio and his character provides the function of \\"bastardy in the misogynist gender politics of the play.\\" Necrophilia While the play does not quite imply sexual intercourse with a corpse, some critics have found a strong connection to desire that can be found in the instances where the skull is used. According to Karin S. Coddon, there is a sense of macabre eroticism that pervades the work. She notes that \\"Gloriana's skull is a prop endowed with remarkable spectacular and material efficacy.\\" Vindice has kept the skull long after his beloved's death and has used it to attract the duke to his death, a kiss of death was bestowed. Considering the description of the skull it should be impossible to discern its gender yet throughout in each section it is mentioned with the gender of a woman attributed to a woman. Vindice's use of the skull to kill the duke borders on a form of prostitution which also implies the sexual nature surrounding the partial corpse. Vindice, in act 3, scene 5 enters \\"with the skull of his love dressed up in tires;\\" in Coddon's view, the skull's gendering is clearly a contrivance. Authorship The play was published anonymously in 1607; the title page of this edition announced that it had been performed \\"sundry times\\" by the King's Men (Loughrey and Taylor, xxv). A second edition, also anonymous (actually consisting of the first edition with a revised title-page), was published later in 1607. The play was first attributed to Cyril Tourneur by Edward Archer in 1656; the attribution was seconded by Francis Kirkman in lists of 1661 and 1671.Gibbons, ix Tourneur was accepted as the author despite Archer's unreliability and the length of time between composition and attribution (Greg, 316). Edmund Kerchever Chambers cast doubt on the attribution in 1923 (Chambers, 4.42), and over the course of the twentieth century a considerable number of scholars argued for attributing the play to Thomas Middleton. There are indications that this play was submitted by Middleton to Robert Keysar of The Queen's Revels company under the name of The Viper and Her Brood. The critics who supported the Tourneur attribution argued that the tragedy is unlike Middleton's other early dramatic work, and that internal evidence, including some idiosyncrasies of spelling, points to Tourneur. More recent scholarly studies arguing for attribution to Middleton point to thematic and stylistic similarities to Middleton's other work, to the differences between The Revenger's Tragedy and Tourneur's other known work, The Atheist's Tragedy, and to contextual evidence suggesting Middleton's authorship (Loughrey and Taylor, xxvii). Since the massive and widely acclaimed statistical studies by David Lake (The Canon of Middleton's Plays, Cambridge University Press, 1975) and MacDonald P. Jackson (Middleton and Shakespeare: Studies in Attribution, 1979), Middleton's authorship has not been seriously contested, and no scholar has mounted a new defence of the discredited Tourneur attribution. The play is attributed to Middleton in Jackson's facsimile edition of the 1607 quarto (1983), in Bryan Loughrey and Neil Taylor's edition of Five Middleton Plays (Penguin, 1988), and in Thomas Middleton: The Collected Works (Oxford, 2007). Two important editions of the 1960s that attributed the play to Tourneur switched in the 1990s to stating no author (Gibbons, 1967 and 1991) or to crediting \\"Tourneur/Middleton\\" (Foakes, 1966 and 1996), both now summarising old arguments for Tourneur's authorship without endorsing them. A summary of the great variety of evidence for Middleton's authorship is contained in the relevant sections of Thomas Middleton and Early Modern Textual Culture, general editors Gary Taylor and John Lavagnino (Oxford, 2007). Influences The Revenger's Tragedy is influenced by Seneca and Medieval theatre. It is written in 5 actsBaker, Howard. \\"Ghosts and Guides: Kyd's 'Spanish Tragedy' and the Medieval Tragedy.\\" Modern Philology 33.1 (1935): p. 27 and opens with a monologue that looks back at previous events and anticipates future events. This monologue is spoken by Vindice, who says he will take revenge and explains the corruption in court. It uses onomastic rhetoric in Act 3, scene 5 where characters play upon their own names, a trait considered to be Senecan.Boyles, A.J. Tragic Seneca. London: Routledge, 1997, p. 162 The verbal violence is seen as Senecan, with Vindice in Act 2, scene 1, calling out against heaven, \\" Why does not heaven turn black or with a frown/ Undo the world?\\" The play also adapts Senecan attributes with the character Vindice. At the end of the play he is a satisfied revenger, which is typically Senecan. However, he is punished for his revenge, unlike the characters in Seneca's Medea and Thyestes.Ayres, Phillip J. \\"Marston's Antonio's Revenge: The Morality of the Revenging Hero.\\" Studies in English Literature: 1500‚Äì1900 12.2, p. 374 In another adaptation of Seneca, there is a strong element of meta-theatricality as the play makes references to itself as a tragedy. For example, in Act 4, scene 2, \\"Vindice: Is there no thunder left, or is't kept up / In stock for heavier vengeance [Thunder] There it goes!\\" Along with influences from Seneca, this play is said to be very relevant to, or even about, Shakespeare's Hamlet. The differences between the two, however, stem from the topic of \\"moral disorientation\\" found in The Revenger's Tragedy which is unlike anything found in a Shakespeare play. This idea is discussed in a scholarly article written by Scott McMillin, who addresses Howard Felperin's views of the two plays. McMillin goes on to disagree with the idea of a \\"moral disorientation,\\" and finds The Revenger's Tragedy to be perfectly clear morally. McMillin asserts The Revenger's Tragedy is truly about theater, and self-abandonment within theatrics and the play itself. It is also noted that the most common adverb in The Revenger's Tragedy is the word \\"now\\" which emphasizes the compression of time and obliteration of the past. In Hamlet time is discussed in wider ranges, which is especially apparent when Hamlet himself thinks of death. This is also very different from Vindice's dialogue, as well as dialogue altogether in The Revenger's Tragedy. The medieval qualities in the play are described by Lawrence J. Ross as, \\"the contrasts of eternity and time, the fusion of satirically realistic detail with moral abstraction, the emphatic condemnation of luxury, avarice and superfluity, and the lashing of judges, lawyers, usurers and women.\\"Tourneur, Cyril. The Revenger's Tragedy. Lawrence J. Ross, ed. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1966, p. xxii To personify Revenge is seen as a Medieval characteristic.Baker, p. 29 Although The Revenger's Tragedy does not personify this trait with a character, it is mentioned in the opening monologue with a capital, thereby giving it more weight than a regular noun. Performance history The play was entered in the Stationer's Register on 7 October 1607 and was performed by the King's Men. The main house that the play was performed in was the Globe Theatre, but it was also performed at court, on tour, or in the Blackfriars Theatre.Gibbons, B. (2008). The Revenger's Tragedy (3rd ed., pp. Xxvii-xxviii). London: Bloomsbury Methuen Drama. A Dutch adaptation, Wraeck-gierigers treur-spel, translated by Theodore Rodenburgh, was performed and published in 1618. It was produced at the Pitlochry Festival Theatre in 1965. The following year, Trevor Nunn produced the play for the Royal Shakespeare Company; Ian Richardson played Vindice. Executed on a tight budget (designer Christopher Morley had to use the sets from the previous year's Hamlet), Nunn's production earned largely favourable reviews. In 1987, Di Trevis revived the play for the RSC at the Swan Theatre in Stratford-upon- Avon; Antony Sher played Vindice. It was also staged by the New York Protean Theatre in 1996. A Brussels theatre company called Atelier Sainte-Anne, led by Philippe Van Kessel, also staged the play in 1989. In this production, the actors wore punk costumes and the play took place in a disquieting underground location which resembled both a disused parking lot and a ruined Renaissance building. In 1976, Jacques Rivette made a loose French film adaptation Noro√Æt, which changed the major characters into women, and included several poetic passages in English; it starred Geraldine Chaplin, Kika Markham, and Bernadette Lafont. In 2002, a film adaptation entitled Revengers Tragedy was directed by Alex Cox with a heavily adapted screenplay by Frank Cottrell Boyce. The film is set in a post-apocalyptic Liverpool (in the then future 2011) and stars Christopher Eccleston as Vindice, Eddie Izzard as Lussurioso, Diana Quick as The Duchess and Derek Jacobi as The Duke. It was produced by Bard Entertainment Ltd. In 2008, two major companies staged revivals of the play: Jonathan Moore directed a new production at the Royal Exchange, Manchester from May to June 2008, starring Stephen Tompkinson as Vindice, while a National Theatre production at the Olivier Theatre was directed by Melly Still, starring Rory Kinnear as Vindice, and featuring a soundtrack performed by a live orchestra and DJs Differentgear. In 2018 a stage adaptation was directed by Cheek by Jowl's Declan Donnellan at the Piccolo Teatro (Milan). The production toured in Italy in early 2019 and in Europe in early 2020.

Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks (, ), Op. 28, is a tone poem written in 1894‚Äì95 by Richard Strauss. It chronicles the misadventures and pranks of the German peasant folk hero Till Eulenspiegel, who is represented by two themes. The first, played by the horn, is a lilting melody that reaches a peak, falls downward, and ends in three long, loud notes, each progressively lower. The second, for D clarinet, is crafty and wheedling, suggesting a trickster doing what he does best. Analysis The work opens with a \\"Once upon a time\\" theme, \\\\relative c { \\\\clef treble \\\\key f \\\\major \\\\time 4/8 \\\\tempo \\"Gem√§chlich\\" 8=88 \\\\partial 8*1 a8(\\\\p  f-.) b,( c-.) cis(  f4.) } as a solo horn bursts in with two repetitions of the first Till theme. \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\key f \\\\major \\\\tempo 4.=88 \\\\time 6/8 r8 c-. f-. g-. gis4~(  gis8 a) c,-. f-. g!-. gis~(  gis4 a8) c,-. f-. g!-.  gis4-> a-> bes8-. b-.  d-. c-. a-. f-. c-. a-.  \\\\clef bass f4. c->  f,-> } The theme is taken by the rest of the orchestra in a rondo form (which Strauss spelled in its French form, rondeau), and this beginning section concludes with the tutti orchestra repeating two notes. The clarinet theme is heard next, suggesting Till's laughter as he plots his next prank. \\\\relative c { \\\\clef treble \\\\key f \\\\major \\\\tempo 4.=108 \\\\time 6/8 r8 a16\\\\mf(^\\"lustig\\" f b,8) c-.\\\\< cis-. f-.\\\\\\\\!  2.~(\\\\sfz  \\\\>  8\\\\\\\\!) } The music follows Till throughout the countryside, as he rides a horse through a market, upsetting the goods and wares, pokes fun at the strict Teutonic clergy (represented by the violas), flirts with and chases girls (the love theme is given to the first violins), and mocks the serious academics (represented by the bassoons). The music suggesting a horse ride returns again, with the first theme restated all over the orchestra. The climax abruptly changes to a funeral march. Till has been captured by the authorities, and is sentenced to death for blasphemy. The funeral march of the headsman begins a dialogue with the desperate Till, who tries to wheedle and joke his way out of this predicament. Unfortunately, he has no effect on the stony executioner, who hangs him. The progress of Till being hauled up the gallows is graphically painted by the D clarinet, with the anticipatory drumroll emulated by the flutes after he has reached the top. The D clarinet wails in a distortion of the first theme, signifying his death scream as the drop begins, and a pizzicato by the strings represents the snapping of his neck as the noose rope reaches full extension. After a moment of silence, the \\"once upon a time\\" theme heard at the beginning returns, suggesting that someone like Till can never be destroyed, and the work ends with one last quotation of the musical joke. Instrumentation The work is scored for a large orchestra: ;Woodwinds :piccolo :3 flutes :3 oboes :English horn :2 clarinets in B :D clarinet1 :bass clarinet :3 bassoons :contrabassoon ;Brass :4 horns in F and E :4 horns in D (ad libitum)2 :3 trumpets in F and C :3 trumpets in D (ad libitum)2 :3 trombones :tuba ;Percussion :timpani :bass drum :snare drum :cymbals :triangle :large ratchet ;Strings :violins I, II :violas :cellos :double basses 1Although the original score calls for a clarinet in D, the part is usually played on an E clarinet as the D clarinet is now rarely played. 2Strauss indicates four extra horns and three extra trumpets to be added ad libitum. The parts are to be played by separate players from the original four horns and three trumpets. There also exists a version for piano four-hands, which has been recorded by Percy Grainger and Ralph Leopold.

The British Film Yearbook for 1945 described his work as \\"one of the most valuable facets of British propaganda\\".Noble 1945, p. 74. The film helped to inspire the Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg to mount his real-life rescue operation in Budapest that saved tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews from Nazi concentration camps during the last months of the Second World War.Linn√©a 1993, p. 27. Plot In the spring of 1939, months before the outbreak of the war, eccentric Cambridge archaeologist Horatio Smith (Leslie Howard) takes a group of British and American archaeology students to Nazi Germany to help in his excavations. His research is supported by the Nazis, since he professes to be looking for evidence of the Aryan origins of German civilisation. However, he has a secret agenda: to free inmates of the concentration camps. During one such daring rescue, he hides disguised as a scarecrow in a field and is inadvertently shot by a German soldier idly engaging in a bit of target practice. Wounded, he still manages to free a celebrated pianist from a work gang. Later, his students guess his secret when they see his injury and connect it to a story about the latter-day Scarlet Pimpernel in a newspaper. They enthusiastically volunteer to assist him. German Gestapo general von Graum (Francis Sullivan) is determined to find out the identity of the \\"Pimpernel\\" and eliminate him. Von Graum forces Ludmilla Koslowska (Mary Morris) to help him by threatening the life of her father, a leading Polish democrat held prisoner by the Nazis. When Smith finds out, he promises her he will free Koslowski. Smith and his students, masquerading as American journalists, visit the camp in which Koslowski is being held. They overpower their escort, put on their uniforms, and leave with Koslowski and some other inmates. By now, von Graum is sure Smith is the man he is after, so he stops the train transporting the professor and various packing crates out of the country. However, when he has the crates opened, he is disappointed to find only ancient artefacts from Smith's excavations. Von Graum still has Ludmilla, so Smith comes back for her. The general catches the couple at a border crossing. The Nazis are not even interested in Ludmilla, happy to have caught Smith. Smith tells Graum that the artefacts he has discovered disprove Nazi claims about the Aryan origins of the Germans. He predicts the Nazis will destroy themselves. In the end, Smith manages to distract his adversary and escape into the fog, but promises to come back.

Following the mass deportations that had started in April 1944, Wallenberg was sent to Budapest in August 1944, as First Secretary to the Swedish legation, assigned under secret agreement between the US and Swedish governments to organise a rescue programme for the Jews.

The name was first used in 1997 for a sequel to Super Mario 64 for the 64DD, which was canceled. The name was reused for a GameCube tech demo at the Nintendo Space World trade show in 2000. Nintendo gradually incorporated the demonstrated graphics and physics concepts into the rapid object generation of Pikmin (2001), the physics of Metroid Prime (2002), and the sphere walking technology of The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (2006) and Super Mario Galaxy (2007). The Super Mario 128 demo intrigued widespread analysis, rumors, and anticipation in the media throughout the 2000s. History =Super Mario 64-2= The name Super Mario 128 was first used as early as January 1997 by Shigeru Miyamoto, as a possible name for a Super Mario 64 sequel. This rumored expansion and sequel to Super Mario 64 called Super Mario 64-2 was said to be developed for the 64DD, but was canceled due to the 64DD's commercial failure. Shigeru Miyamoto mentioned at E3's August 1997 convention that he was \\"just getting started\\" on the project. At Nintendo's Space World 1997 trade show in November 1997, Miyamoto added \\"We haven't decided [whether it's two-player] yet. We are currently working with a system where Mario and Luigi can co-exist, and they are both controllable by the player. But we will decide more game elements when we finish everything about Zelda.\\" In November 1999, Miyamoto said, \\"Well, for over a year now at my desk, a prototype program of Mario and Luigi has been running on my monitor. We've been thinking about the game, and it may be something that could work on a completely new game system.\\" The game had only a demo of one level made for it. Miyamoto claimed that multiplayer functionality was the first aspect of the game that he wanted to include. Miyamoto had considered the two next frontiers of the Super Mario series to be a gameplay mechanic of walking on a rotating sphere, and coincidentally a setting in spacebut it took a long time to find a way to resonate these ideas with the production team. He loved the novel idea of sphere walking, because it was totally unexplored in the game industry, and because focusing on a full sphere can eliminate camera movements and thus motion sickness. He learned greatly from the world's adaptation to the 3D gameplay of Super Mario 64 and he briefly experimented with rolling fields during the development of Paper Mario (2000) for Nintendo 64. During the development of Doshin the Giant for Nintendo 64, he eagerly proposed that it could become the first sphere walking game but the staff rejected such an exceedingly massive development for the game which was released in December 1999. =GameCube demo= The name Super Mario 128 gained permanent fame when reused for a new technology demonstration at the Space World event on August 24-26, 2000. This software was controlled by staff to show new gameplay mechanics and the processing power of the upcoming GameCube game console. Development of the demo was directed by Yoshiaki Koizumi, who would later become the director of Super Mario Galaxy. In the demo, a large 2D Mario spawned increasing numbers of smaller Mario figures, independently walking across a circular board, until the number of onscreen characters reached 128. The terrain in the demo was manipulated, rotated, and spun like a floppy saucer to show the physics engine software. GamePro declared Super Mario 128 to be one of the 15 most anticipated games of 2001. Regarding Nintendo's secrecy and lack of elaborate demonstration of the camera system, GamePro assumed that \\"The precautions are warranted as developer after developer aped the exact camera mechanism from Mario 64 for their titles.\\" Koizumi said he spent much thought after the event about the \\"close to impossible\\" undertaking of productizing Super Mario 128 as demonstrated. Combining that demo's rounded surface with Mario's need to freely roam, Koizumi's next imagined groundbreaking objective was to demonstrate Mario walking upon a gravitational sphere. To even be able to attempt that, would require tremendous technological expertise, motivation, and achievement from a dedicated team and would not be undertaken until 2003. There had always been distinctly separate development of Super Mario 128 and Super Mario Sunshine, which Miyamoto considered to be similar to Super Mario 64 anyway. He said, \\"obviously we were doing work on the Mario 128 demo that we were showing at Space World, and separately we were doing work on experiments that we made into Mario Sunshine.\\" At Space World 2001, Super Mario Sunshine was unveiled as the next in the Mario series, released in 2002. Nintendo commemorated the height of Super Mario 128 hype in the 2001 GameCube game Super Smash Bros. Melee with a battle stage titled \\"Super Mario 128\\", where the player is assailed by a total of 128 tiny Mario figurines. =Resurfacing= In 2002, Miyamoto predicted that Super Mario 128 would let players \\"feel the newness that was missing\\" from Super Mario Sunshine because he thought of that game as more of a revisitation of Super Mario 64. Rumors said that the reason for Nintendo not having shown Super Mario 128 at E3 2003 was because the game was extraordinarily innovative and Nintendo did not want other developers stealing the ideas from the gameas some had assumed about the Space World 2000 show. However, Miyamoto later confirmed that Super Mario 128 was still in development and that the development team had planned to take the Mario series in a new direction. In 2003, Nintendo's George Harrison stated that Super Mario 128 may not appear on GameCube at all. Yoshiaki Koizumi, who had directed the original Super Mario 128 demonstration, joined Nintendo's new EAD Tokyo office. There, Shigeru Miyamoto pushed him to hold a much bigger vision for the next Mario series game and Koizumi said this: \\"By working on [Donkey Kong Jungle Beat] together, I got to know the staff well enough by then, and I thought, if it was with this team, we may just be able to tackle the new and difficult challenge of making spherical platforms work.\\" There at EAD in 2003, Koizumi's team began working on prototypical spherical platforms in an intensive three-month process of iterative demonstrations for Miyamoto. Nintendo's President Satoru Iwata requested Miyamoto's singular signature effort to turn this product, which would become Super Mario Galaxy, into a showcase for the Wii. It was thought that Nintendo would unveil the game at E3 2004. Miyamoto again confirmed the existence of Super Mario 128 in an interview during February 2004, but the game failed to surface. Some believed this was due to the announcements of The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess and the Nintendo DS, both revealed at the 2004 show. GameSpy asked Miyamoto about the game after E3: IGN later in the year got a similar response. Miyamoto again asserted Super Mario 128s experimental nature. At the GDC 2005, Nintendo of America's VP of Marketing, Reggie Fils-Aim√©, stated that Super Mario 128 would be shown at E3 2005, probably in the form of a non-interactive video. However, for the third year in a row, the game once again failed to surface during E3. During a GameSpot video interview at E3, Reggie Fils-Aim√© stated, \\"I can only show what Mr. Miyamoto gives me to show.\\" When a reporter asked if it exists, he responded, \\"I've seen bits and pieces.\\" In an interview with Miyamoto from 2005, a Wired News reporter confirmed that Super Mario 128 would not be produced for the GameCube, but rather that it had been definitively moved to the Wii (then code-named Revolution). In September 2005, Shigeru Miyamoto gave his least ambiguous comments regarding Super Mario 128. Questioned as to the status of the game by a Japanese radio station, he revealed that Mario would have a new character by his side and reiterated that the game would appear on the Wii with a different name. He mentioned that Super Mario 128 had played a large role in the conception of the Wii console (then known as Revolution), as Super Mario 64 had done for the Nintendo 64. He went as far to say that the Wii was based around \\"this new type of game\\". In 2006, Miyamoto said that he had forgotten whether Super Mario 64-2 had been prototyped for the 64DD, and said that \\"it's become other games\\". When asked whether he meant that the demo's gameplay functions are being used in other games, Miyamoto responded, \\"From the time that we were originally making Mario 64, Mario and Luigi were moving together. But we couldn't get it working in the form of a game\\", echoing his statements from 1999. He also hinted that some elements inspired by Super Mario 128, such as running upon a spherical surface, had been incorporated into Super Mario Galaxy. On March 8, 2007, Miyamoto delivered the GDC 2007 keynote speech. He mentioned that Super Mario 128 was merely a demonstration of the GameCube's power and restated that several techniques from Super Mario 128 had become foundational gameplay concepts of the Pikmin series and the upcoming Super Mario Galaxy series. He said \\"The one question I'm always asked is, 'What happened to Mario 128?' ... Most of you already played it ... in a game called Pikmin\\". Legacy Initially presented as a public demonstration of the new GameCube's computational power and of Nintendo's programming prowess, the secrecy and hype of Super Mario 128 provoked some of the greatest anticipation in video gaming of 2001 and into the 2000s. The height of its intrigue is commemorated in the 2001 GameCube game Super Smash Bros. Melee a battle stage titled \\"Super Mario 128\\" (Event 22), where the player is assailed by a total of 128 tiny Mario figurines. The software technology and concepts within the Super Mario 128 demonstration became or inspired core components of other Nintendo games: the explosive herding and wandering behaviors of multitudinous tiny automatons in the Pikmin series since 2001; the physics of Metroid Prime in 2002; the sphere-walking gravity of the Super Mario Galaxy series since 2007 and The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess in 2006. The director of the Super Mario 128 demo, Yoshiaki Koizumi, became the director of Super Mario Galaxy.

During the trial Nicolich's daughter wrote that she had forgiven the drunk driver and urged that the court do likewise. The subsequent court case led to a Nebraska Supreme Court decision on the issue of leniency in drunk driving deaths. The story was part of an The Oprah Winfrey Show and the book The Road To Forgiveness: Hearts Shattered by Tragedy, Transformed by Love. Birth and marriage Janice Ann Winblad was born on August 9, 1935 in Astoria, New York to Anthony LeRoy Winblad (1912‚Äì1970) and Maria W. Zorovich (1912‚Äì1993). Janice Winblad married Joseph Anthony Nicolich on May 15, 1954 in Astoria. She was Roman Catholic for most of her adult life and raised her children Catholic. Sometime in the late 1980s or early 1990s she became a member of the Bethlehem Assemblies of God Church in Valley Stream, New York. Drive to Salt Lake City Joseph and Janice Nicolich were on their way to their son's wedding in Salt Lake City, Utah, on June 28, 1996. They were on Interstate 80, near Sidney, Nebraska in their Chrysler Town & Country van. Joe was driving, his wife was in the passenger seat, and their granddaughter, Robyn Griffiths (1985‚Äì1996), was in the rear seat. It was raining and Joe saw a car stationary at the side of the road with its flashers on. He was pulling onto the shoulder and slowed down to approximately when he was hit from behind. Robyn Griffiths and Janice Winblad Nicolich were killed. Sentence The trial court sentenced Verma Harrison, the drunk driver, to five years' probation on each count. The sentences were to be served consecutively. The conditions of probation subjected Harrison to random drug and alcohol testing, home visitations, and a treatment referral. The light sentence was appealed by Joe Nicolich and was heard by the Nebraska State Court of Appeals which found the sentence to be excessively lenient. On January 22, 1999 the Nebraska Supreme Court upheld the original sentencing.

Products  The mile-long facility is best known as the plant that produced the AS/400 computer system, which later was rebranded as the iSeries and now System i. RS/6000, now System p, and hard disk development has also occurred at the site at points in the past. IBM Power Systems development is still done at the site. PureSystems were originally assembled at this site,IT-Jungle Volume 21, Number 16 -- April 23, 2012 but are now mainly assembled in New York and Mexico.IBM moving Rochester production to NY, Mexico March 6, 2013 at MPRNews The IBM 5110 personal computer was developed and manufactured in the facility. The IBM 3740 Data Entry System was developed at the facility in 1973 and the follow-on IBM 5280 Distributed Data System had its beginnings there as well, but was transferred to the Austin, TX, facility in 1981 where it was released for production. The advent of personal computing swallowed up this type of data entry by 1990. IBM Rochester played an important in the Summit and Sierra supercomputers.  Distinctions  The AS/400 division at the plant received the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award in 1990. In November 2004, the facility claimed the top spot in the TOP500 list of fast supercomputers with a prototype Blue Gene/L system containing 32,768 processors. It clocked in at 70.72 teraflops. The manufacturing output of the site is so great that if it were a separate company, it would be the world's third-largest computer producer. The plant, which is near U.S. Highway 52 in the northwestern part of Rochester, was recognized in 1990 by the National Building Museum as one of the significant contributions of IBM to the built environment of the United States, along with IBM's New York City headquarters and the IBM building in Atlanta, Georgia.  Tenants  Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, although having been spun off from IBM Storage Technology, remains on-site, leasing otherwise unused space from IBM. Along with the Mayo Clinic, the IBM plant is one of the biggest employers in the Rochester area, reportedly numbering around 5,000 in 2002. References *(Winter 1990). Honor Award 1990.

The station is on the High Barnet branch of the Northern line between Finchley Central and Woodside Park stations and is in Travelcard Zone 4. History The station was opened by the London & North Eastern Railway (LNER) on 1 March 1933 on its line to High Barnet.Clive's Underground Line Guides - Northern Line, Dates It opened to serve new housing developing in the area and was built with only modest station structures from the outset. Many fittings were taken from stations in the north of England. The footbridge has been claimed to come from Wintersett and Ryhill station in Yorkshire, which had closed in 1930, although its station footbridge does not look the same in photographs. The section of the High Barnet branch north of East Finchley was incorporated into the London Underground network through the \\"Northern Heights\\" project begun in the late 1930s. West Finchley station was first served by Northern line trains on 14 April 1940 and, after a period where the station was serviced by both operators, LNER services ended in 1941. Local information The main entrance is in Nether Street; there is a small front garden between the pavement and the building containing the booking office, though it is not accessible to the public (there are high fences on each side of the path). Access to the northbound platform by wheelchair and with push-chair is straightforward, though it is necessary to cross a footbridge to reach the southbound platform. Although there is an entrance directly onto the south-bound platform, it is only open during the morning rush hour. This small entrance was closed for security reasons during the weeks following the 7 July 2005 London bombings although it has now reopened. Ticket office closure London Underground Limited announced in June 2007 that due to reduced demand for tickets bought from ticket offices (as opposed to from machines) around 40 of the most lightly used ticket offices at Tube stations will close from March 2008. The list of stations includes West Finchley. Services and connections Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally operate every 3‚Äì7 minutes between 06:09 and 00:13 in both directions. London Bus routes 13, 125, 221, 460, 683 and night route N20 serves nearby the station.

Engaged Buddhist Reader. p. 254 (Johanneshof) in Germany's Black Forest. As the American Dharma heir to Shunryu Suzuki, Baker assumed abbotship of the San Francisco Zen Center (SFZC) shortly before Suzuki's death in 1971. He remained abbot there until 1984, the year he resigned his position after it was disclosed in the previous year that he and the wife of one of SFZC's benefactors had been having an ongoing affair. Despite the controversy connected with his resignation, Baker was instrumental in helping the San Francisco Zen Center to become one of the most successful Zen institutions in the United States. Early life and practice Richard Baker was born in Biddeford, Maine, on March 30, 1936, the son of Harold Baker and Elisabeth Dudley. Because his family moved around frequently, he lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Indiana, and Pittsburgh growing up. A descendant of Thomas Dudley,Tworkov, Helen.

San Francisco Zen Center San Francisco Zen Center's Page St. location Baker received Dharma transmission from Suzuki in 1970, and then was installed as abbot of San Francisco Zen Center during the \\"Mountain Seat Ceremony\\" on November 21, 1971. Baker also penned the introduction to Suzuki's famous book, Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind.Azara, Nancy J. Spirit Taking Form. p. 33 Within a very short period of time Baker broadened the scope of SFZC, starting first with the acquisition of Green Gulch Farm in southern Marin county, in 1972. San Francisco Zen Center expanded quickly with Baker at the helm. In fifteen years, the Center's annual budget increased from $6,000, to $4 million. It acquired property worth around $20 million and built up a network of affiliated businesses staffed by Zen Center students, which included the vegetarian Greens Restaurant in Fort Mason, a bakery, and a grocery store.Coleman, James William. The New Buddhism pp. 167‚Äì168 In the midst of the growth, Baker became a popular public figure. Although his salary was reportedly modest, he lived a lifestyle which many perceived as extravagant. With so many students and so much public attention, some felt Baker became less available to the members of the community. All of this discontent emerged when it was made public that Baker had allegedly been having an affair with the wife of an influential sangha member. Resignation The zendo at Tassajara Zen Mountain Center Although Baker claimed that his relationship with the woman was a love-affair which had not yet been consummated, the outcry surrounding the incident led to a series of accusations of impropriety on Baker's part, including the admissions by several female members of the community that they had had affairs with Baker before or during his tenure as abbot.Schneider, David. Street Zen pp.138‚Äì140 The community's sense of crisis sharpened when the woman's husband, one of SFZC's primary benefactors, threatened to hold the organization legally responsible for its abbot's apparent misconduct.Crews, Frederick C. Follies of the Wise pp. 283‚Äì284 These revelations led to community-wide pandemonium, and in 1984 Baker was forced to resign as abbot. However, San Francisco Zen Center's website now comments: \\"Although the circumstances leading to his resignation as abbot in 1984 were difficult and complex, in recent years, there has been increased contact; a renewal of friendship and dharma relations.\\" And Baker, for his part, is quoted as having said in a 1994 interview with Sugata Schneider: > I don't think that the gossipy or official versions of what happened are > right, but I feel definitely that if I were back in the situation again as > the person I am now, it wouldn't have happened. Which means it's basically > my fault. I had a kind of insecurity and self-importance, which I didn't see > for a long time, that was a bad dynamic in the community. In 1983 Tenshin Reb Anderson received shiho (Dharma Transmission) from Richard Baker. Anderson succeeded him as abbot, and later co-abbot. In the late-1980s Baker also gave shiho to Issan Dorsey, whom he had ordained as a priest in 1975. Dorsey went on to serve as abbot of the Hartford Street Zen Center in San Francisco, where he worked to develop hospice care for AIDS patients.Schneider, David. Street Zen pp. 113, 162, 170 Dharma Sangha Following his departure from the San Francisco Zen Center in 1984, Baker relocated to Santa Fe, New Mexico where he founded a new community known as Dharma Sangha. One student who followed him to his new community was the priest Philip Whalen (ordained by Baker as a priest in 1973), who became tanto (head monk) of the new center. In July 1987 Baker gave Dharma transmission to Whalen; Whalen later became abbot of the Hartford Street Zen Center (following the tenure of Issan Dorsey) in the Castro district of San Francisco. After the founding of Dharma Sangha in New Mexico, Baker met with William Irwin Thompson, the founder of the Lindisfarne Association. At a meeting of the Board of Directors of Lindisfarne at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York, Thompson convinced the board to donate the campus that he had established‚Äîwith its passive solar Lindisfarne Fellows House, Founder's House, and Lindisfarne Chapel‚Äîto Baker-roshi's Dharma Sangha. Baker then moved to Crestone, Colorado and Germany to found other practice sites for Dharma Sangha. Baker also gives seminars at Boulder Zen Center in Boulder, Colorado twice each year, typically on the last weekends of January and April. A once controversial figure, Richard Baker was publicly criticized for his behavior at San Francisco Zen Center. Former students have said that he was addicted to power, abusive of his position, extravagant in his personal spending, and inappropriate in his love life.Boucher, Sandy. Turning the Wheel. p. 250 In the twenty-five years since leaving San Francisco Zen Center, Baker has continued his career as a Zen teacher, founding and developing two practice centers. Thich Nhat Hanh wrote of Baker, \\"To me, he embodies very much the future of Buddhism in the West with his creative intelligence and his aliveness.\\"Schneider, David. Street Zen pp. 145‚Äì146 Family On September 25, 1999 in Salem, Baker married Marie Louise, daughter of Maximilian, Margrave of Baden, and grandniece of Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.

Winners are awarded a statuette depicting a rose chafer, better known by the name Guldbaggen. The awards, first presented in 1964 at the Grand H√¥tel in Stockholm, are overseen by the Swedish Film Institute. It is described as the Swedish equivalent of the Academy Awards. The awards ceremony was first televised in 1981 on SVT2, and has since then been broadcast, almost every year, on SVT1, SVT2 or TV4.  History  Olof Palme in a conversation with Lena Nyman, who received one of the three awards that were distributed at the 5th Guldbagge Awards. The first Guldbagge Awards were presented on September 25, 1964, at a private party at Grand H√¥tel in Stockholm. Four \\"guldbaggar\\" were awarded, honoring directors, actors, actresses and other personalities of the film-making industry of the time for their works during the 1963‚Äì64 period. The original categories were: Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Actress. The first Best Actor awarded was Keve Hjelm, for his performance in Raven's End. The first Best Actress was awarded to Ingrid Thulin, for her performance in The Silence. The first Best Director were awarded to Ingmar Bergman, for his work on the film The Silence, which also won the first Best Film award. For a long time, the Guldbagge Awards were an exquisite exclusivity, and it was supposed to be so, and it took fifteen years before someone managed to win a second time, which was Keve Hjelm, receiving a special price for his performance in the television series God natt, jord. For the first nineteen ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned two calendar years. For example, the 2nd Guldbagge Awards presented on October 15, 1965, recognized films that were released between July, 1964 and June, 1965. Starting with the 20th Guldbagge Awards, held in 1985, the period of eligibility became the full previous calendar year from January 1 to December 31. The Awards presented at that ceremony were in respect of 18 months of film production owing to the changeover from the broken calendar year to the standard calendar year during 1984. Due to a mediocre film year, no awards ceremony was held in 1971, and only the category for Best Film was awarded that year. Since that year, ceremonies were held annually. Before 1991 the awards did not announce nominees, only winners. From 1991 and forward, SFI introduced the system of three nominations in all price categories. In 2016, the following categories has been expanded to four nominees: Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actress, Best Actor, Supporting Actress and Supporting Actor, while the category of Best Film has been expanded to five.  The Award  = Design = A Guldbagge from the 48th Guldbagge Awards ceremony, January 21, 2013. The prize itself, a small statue in the shape of a beetle, is made from copper which is enamelled and gilded and weighs approximately 1.2 kg. It was designed by the artist Karl Axel Pehrson, who won a design competition, which was organized on the initiative of SFI's CEO at the time, Harry Schein. The award would then be presented to those who had made a strong contribution during the year. Exactly which artists, beside Pehrson, who took part in the competition is still wrapped in mystery. An inscription of the name of the award's winner, and the category in question, is glued to the underside of the beetle. The following text is engraved under the abdomens of each beetle: \\"Guldbaggen: comic, tragic, bizarre, outstanding - as the film's contrast-rich world. Its shimmering flight - operating filmstrip\\". All beetles are similar and yet different and unique works of art. = Etymology = Guldbagge is the Swedish name for Cetonia aurata, a beetle also known as rose chafer. Karl Axel Pehrson gave the following description of why he chose a rose chafer beetle as his inspiration when designing the award: \\"The rose chafer likes to fly in the summer sunshine. It shimmers much like a film strip as it flies by. Something about its behaviour and its way of living can be likened to that of film.\\"  Nomination  = The Nominating Committee = Which films and who should be nominated for the Guldbagge Awards different categories are determined by a nominating committee. It consists of 45 members who nominate three candidates in each category, except for the Best Foreign Film, Best Short Film and Best Documentary, which has special nominating groups. The Committee members are active in the Swedish film industry and are appointed by their respective organizations or institutions, as determined by the Swedish Film Institute's Board of Directors. The members appointed are assumed to have solid experience in the professional occupation within film or documented experience in assessing cinematic expression. In appointing the members of the Nominating Committee seeks gender parity and level of ages. Jury members shall observe professional secrecy regarding their participation in the jury. Upon disqualification, the Jury member may be replaced. The Swedish Film Institute's Board of Directors appoints the Chairman, who is leading the work. The members of the Nominating Committee is obligated to watch all of the Swedish films that premiered at the cinema the previous year. The process repeats until there are only three candidates remain.  Voting  The members of the committee has one vote in each category, in which they indicate their first, second and third choice, respectively. The votes are then distributed after the first choice, where the choice has collected the fewest votes are discarded. These votes are later distributed to the remaining candidates, now after their second choice. Then the process starts over and the votes are counted on again and the candidate with the fewest votes is removed and distributed over their second choice. If the second choice has already lost, then the voters third choice are counted instead. If even this choice has fallen away, the vote is discarded completely. When everything is ready, there remains only three candidates being nominated for the award ceremony. = The Winners jury = After the nomination process is completed and presented, usually in early January, a winners jury takes over. Through open discussions, the winning jury appoints the winner among the three nominees in all price categories, except for the category Special efforts, which is designated by the jury without prior nomination. The Lifetime Achievement Award is appointed by the Swedish Film Institute's Board of Directors. The announcement of the winners takes place during the award ceremony later in January. The jury consists of 9 members, including the Chairman. The Board of Directors appoints the jury chairman, who then along with a team from the Swedish Film Institute suggests the other eight members. The Chairman has no right to vote and leads the work of the jury. Although, he or she has a casting vote in connection with the jury's decision meeting, if there is an even distribution of votes. The members of the jury should have solid experience in the professional occupation related to film and one of them has to come from another Nordic country. Jury members shall observe professional secrecy regarding their jury work. To secure both the renewal and continuity, a member can only participate in the jury for a maximum of four years.  Merit categories  = Current categories = The award is given out to the best film-related efforts in the following categories: = Discontinued categories = The following list shows earlier awards that has been discontinued:  Special and related categories  Hans Alfredson received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 48th Guldbagge Awards. The awards are voted on by special committees, rather than by the Nominating Committee or the Winners jury as a whole. Some of them have their own statuettes or awards. = Current categories = *Honorary Award: since 2001 *The Gullspira: since 2006 (For an individual who has made a special contribution to children's films.) *The Audience Award: 2007 to 2011; since 2013 (The moviegoers award to the past year's best Swedish film.) = Discontinued categories = *The Ingmar Bergman Award: 1978 to 2007 (Was primarily intended to honour achievements in Swedish film which had not otherwise been considered when the Guldbagge awards were handed out.)  Criticism  In early 2005, the award received some criticism, since only three of the 33 Swedish feature films that premiered in 2004 received nominations in seven main categories (film, direction, actor, actress, supporting actor, supporting actress, screenplay) and it was made public that some of the jury members had not seen all 33 films.

Originally awarded as a non-wearable table medal, in 1935 a wearable version of the medal was subsequently authorized. A commemorative medal, the NC-4 Medal was a one-time award, and does not currently appear on U.S. Navy award precedence charts. Background In 1919, the United States Navy decided to plan a mission to complete the first trans- Atlantic crossing by aircraft. This mission would demonstrate the capabilities of the Navy Curtis seaplane. The mission began with three identical aircraft, NC-1, NC-3, and NC-4 departing from Naval Air Station Rockaway on May 8, 1919. On May 15 the aircraft arrived at Trepassey, Newfoundland, having made intermediate stops along the way. There they met their \\"base ship\\" the , recently converted from minelayer to seaplane tender. After repairs and refitting, the NC's took off for the Azores on 16 May. During this longest leg of the journey, the planes were guided by a picket of twenty-two U.S. Navy ships spaced approximately 50 miles apart. The ships, brightly illuminated, kept the aircraft on course through the night. After flying all night, NC-4 was the sole aircraft to arrive in the Azores. After an elapsed flying time of 15 hours, 18 minutes, NC-4 arrived at the town of Horta on Faial Island in the Azores on May 17, 1919. The crew had flown about 1,200 miles (1,920 km). During the flight bad weather had forced the NC-1 and NC-3 to land in the open sea, with the NC-4 being the only aircraft to successfully complete the flight. Medal authorization Following the 1928 Congressional Gold Medal awarded to Charles Lindbergh for the first solo trans-Atlantic flight, Representative James Russell Leech of Pennsylvania sought to recognize the NC-4 crew. In 1929, he introduced legislation to honoring the accomplishment of the NC-4 crew, for the first trans-Atlantic flight. The United States Congress passed Public Law 70-714 on February 9, 1929. This created the legal authorization to award medals to the members of the NC-4 crew. The law read: > Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United > States of America in Congress assembled, That the President be, and is > hereby, authorized to award, in the name of Congress, gold medals of > appropriate design to Commander John H. Towers for conceiving, organizing, > and commanding the first trans-Atlantic flight; to Lieutenant Commander > Albert C. Read, United States Navy, commanding officer NC-4; to Lieutenant > Elmer F. Stone, United States Coast Guard, pilot; to former Lieutenant > Walter Hinton, United States Navy, pilot; to Lieutenant Herbert C. Rodd, > United States Navy, radio operator; to former Lieutenant James L. Breese, > United States Naval Reserve Force, engineer; and to former Machinist's Mate > Eugene Rhodes, United States Navy, engineer, for their extraordinary > achievement in making the first successful trans-Atlantic flight, in the > United States naval flying boat NC-4, in May, 1919. The original medal was presented as a non-wearable, table medal. This medal was presented to Lieutenant Commander Read, and the other five members of the NC-4 crew. A medal was also awarded to Commander Towers, commander of NC-3, which did not complete the flight. While he may have served as NC-3's commander, he was in command of the mission as commander of Seaplane Division One. =Wearable medal authorization= On April 29, 1935, Congress passed Public Law 74-43 () which allowed personnel of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps to wear miniature versions of medals not previously intended for wear. This meant that awards like the NC-4 Medal could now be worn, at the discretion of the Secretary of the Navy, on the military uniform, borne by an appropriate suspension ribbon or worn as a service ribbon in less formal occasions. Appearance The obverse of the medal bears the stylized image of a seagull, flying above ocean waves, surrounded by the words FIRST TRANSATLANTIC FLIGHT UNITED STATES NAVY MAY 1919 in relief along the outer edges of the medal. On the reverse, in the center of the medal surrounded by a circle is the inscription NC-4, with NEWFOUNDLAND above it and PORTUGAL below. In the lower half of the medal, in two arcs, is the inscription PRESENTED ¬∑ BY ¬∑ THE ¬∑ PRESIDENT ¬∑ OF ¬∑ THE ¬∑ UNITED ¬∑ STATES ¬∑ IN ¬∑ THE ¬∑ NAME ¬∑ OF ¬∑ CONGRESS. In the corresponding position in the top half of the medal, the names of the recipients: J.H. TOWERS ¬∑ A.C. READ ¬∑ E.F. STONE ¬∑ W. HINTON ¬∑ H.C. RODD ¬∑ J.L. BREESE ¬∑ E. RHODES. It is very rare that a Congressional Gold Medal be made for wear on clothing. The NC-4 Medal appeared in older U.S. Navy precedence charts after the Peary Polar Expedition Medal and before the Byrd Antarctic Expedition Medal. The awardee who later was appointed to Vice Admiral, John Towers, was photographed several times as Rear Admiral and Vice Admiral wearing the NC-4 Medal and ribbon ahead of all his other awards. Following the various retirements, deaths, and release from military service of the original recipients, the NC-4 Medal became obsolete and does not appear on any current military award precedence charts.

Hanegraff (Leiden & Boston: Brill, 2006), pp. 177-185. Overview The work was originally entitled The Veil of Isis, a title which remains on the heading of each page, but had to be renamed once Blavatsky discovered that this title had already been used for an 1861 Rosicrucian work by W.W. Reade. Isis Unveiled is divided into two volumes. Volume I, The 'Infallibility' of Modern Science, discusses occult science and the hidden and unknown forces of nature, exploring such subjects as forces, elementals, psychic phenomena, and the Inner and Outer Man. Volume II, Theology, discusses the similarity of Christian scripture to Eastern religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism, the Vedas, and Zoroastrianism. It follows the Renaissance notion of prisca theologia, in that all these religions purportedly descend from a common source; the ancient \\"Wisdom-Religion\\". Blavatsky writes in the preface that Isis Unveiled is \\"a plea for the recognition of the Hermetic philosophy, the anciently universal Wisdom-Religion, as the only possible key to the Absolute in science and theology.\\"Blavatsky, Helena P., Isis Unveiled: A Master-Key to the Mysteries of Ancient and Modern Science and Theology (Pasadena, CA: Theosophical University Press, 1999), vol. I. p. vii. Isis Unveiled is argued by many modern scholars such as Bruce F. Campbell and Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke to be a milestone in the history of Western Esotericism.Goodrick-Clarke, Nicholas, The Western Esoteric Traditions: A Historical Introduction (Oxford & New York: Oxford University Press, 2008), pp. 215-217. Blavatsky gathered a number of themes central to the occult tradition‚Äîperennial philosophy, a Neo- Platonic emanationist cosmology, adepts, esoteric Christianity‚Äîand reinterpreted them in relation to current developments in science and new knowledge of non-Western faiths. In doing so, Isis Unveiled reflected many contemporary controversies‚Äîsuch as Darwin's theories on evolution and their impact on religion‚Äîand engaged in a discussion that appealed to intelligent individuals interested in religion but alienated from conventional Western forms.Campbell, Bruce F. Ancient Wisdom Revived: A History of the Theosophical Movement (Berkeley & Los Angeles, CA: University of California Press, 1980), pp. 34-38, 70-74. Blavatsky's combination of original insights, backed by scholarly and scientific sources, accomplished a major statement of modern occultism's defiance of materialist science. In later theosophical works some of the doctrines originally stated in Isis Unveiled appeared in a significantly altered form, drawing out confusion among readers and even causing some to perceive contradiction. Specifically, the few and‚Äîaccording to many‚Äîambiguous statements on reincarnation as well as the threefold conception of man as body, soul and spirit of Isis Unveiled stand in contrast to the elaborate and definite conception of reincarnation as well as the sevenfold conception of man in The Secret Doctrine (1888). Blavatsky later asserted the correctness of her statements on reincarnation and the constitution of man in Isis Unveiled, attributing the resulting confusion and alleged contradictions to the more superficial or simplified conceptions of the ideas in Isis Unveiled compared to those of later works. Modern Theosophists hold the book as a revealed work dictated to Blavatsky by Theosophy's Masters.Goodrick- Clarke, Nicholas, ‚ÄòThe Coming of the Masters: The Evolutionary Reformulation of Spiritual Intermediaries in Modern Theosophy‚Äô, in Constructing Tradition: Means and Myths of Transmission in Western Esotericism, ed. Andreas B. Kilcher (Leiden & Boston, MA: Brill, 2010). Critical reception William Emmette Coleman Detractors often accuse the book of extensive plagiarism, a view first seriously put forth by William Emmette Coleman shortly after publication and still expressed by modern scholars such as Mark Sedgwick.Sedgwick, Mark. (2004). Against the Modern World: Traditionalism and the Secret Intellectual History of the Twentieth Century. Oxford University Press. p. 44. \\"Isis Unveiled was extensively plagiarized from a variety of standard works on occultism and Hermeticism (134 pages from Samuel Dunlap's Sod, the Son of Man, 107 pages from Joseph Ennemoser's History of Magic, and so on).\\" Similarly, Geoffrey Ashe notes that Isis Unveiled combines \\"comparative religion, occultism, pseudoscience, and fantasy in a m√©lange that shows genuine if superficial research but is not free from unacknowledged borrowing and downright plagiarism.\\"Ashe, Geoffrey. (2001). Encyclopedia of Prophecy. ABC- CLIO. p. 251 Indeed, Isis Unveiled makes use of many sources popular among occultists at the time, often directly copying significant amounts of text. However, rather than dwelling on the plagiarism, scholars such as Bruce Campbell argue: \\"Blavatsky was a person who had an original set of insights but who lacked the literary skills and knowledge of English sufficient to create a work on her own. Relying on written sources and help from friends, she formulated a unique and powerful expression of occult ideas.\\" Joscelyn Godwin and K. Paul Johnson note that early scholarship seemed obsessed with the agenda of exposing Helena Blavatsky as a plagiarist and imposter, but such labels do not properly assess the Theosophical Society's place in the cultural, political, religious, and intellectual history of modern times. The work belongs to a broader movement that seeks to integrate the history of the occult sciences and of esoteric movements with more established subdisciplines. Modern copies of Isis Unveiled are often annotated, fully delineating Blavatsky's sources and influences. Historian Ronald H. Fritze considers Isis Unveiled to be a work of pseudohistory.Fritze, Ronald H. (2009). Invented Knowledge: False History, Fake Science and Pseudo-Religions. Reaktion Books. pp. 41-42. Likewise, Henry R. Evans, a contemporaneous journalist and magician, described the book as a \\"hodge-podge of absurdities, pseudo-science, mythology and folk-lore, arranged in helter-skelter fashion, with an utter disregard of logical sequence.\\"Evans, Henry R. (1897). Hours with the Ghosts, or, Nineteenth Century Witchcraft: Illustrated Investigations into the Phenomena of Spiritualism and Theosophy. Laird & Lee. p. 266 One of Blavatsky's original goals in writing Isis Unveiled and founding the Theosophical Society was to reconcile contemporary advances in science with occultism, and this synthesis was one of the main appeals of Blavatsky's work for individuals interested in religion but alienated from conventional Western forms at the time.Olcott, Henry. Old Diary Leaves: The History of the Theosophical Society, I (Adyar: Theosophical Publishing House, 1972), p. 118Santucci, James A. The Notion of Race in Theosophy, in Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions, 11.3 (2008), pp. 37-63 Theosophy adopted and addressed many ideas from late nineteenth century science. Some, like Darwin's theory of evolution, have continued to be accepted by the scientific community, while others, like the continent of Lemuria, though based on contemporaneous scientific theories, have long since been rendered obsolete by modern advances. Theosophy and Occultism as a whole gained a level of sophistication through the adoption of religious terms largely absent from the preceding Spiritualism movement. However, as Theosophy continued to grow as a religion, it became stuck with certain scientific ideas even after they had been discarded by the scientific community. The inability to adapt to scientific progress presents a disparity between modern Theosophy and the society's original motivations. K. Paul Johnson also notes that many of the more mythical elements of Blavatsky's works, like her later Masters, rather than being outright inventions, were reformulations of preexisting esoteric ideas and the casting of a large group of individuals‚Äîwho helped, encouraged, or collaborated with her‚Äîunder a mythological context; all driven by Blavatsky's search for spiritual truth. Sten Bodvar Liljegren notes that in addition to contemporaneous occult sources and the prevailing orientalism of the period, the novels of Edward Bulwer-Lytton heavily influenced Blavatsky's Theosophical ideas.Bader, A. L. (1958). Through a Glass Darkly: Spiritualism in the Browning Circle by Katherine H. Porter; Bulwer-Lytton's Novels and \\"Isis Unveiled\\" by S. B. Liljegren. Victorian Studies.

The term was used by Mahatma Gandhi as the title of his 1908 translation of John Ruskin's tract on political economy, Unto This Last, and Gandhi came to use the term for the ideal of his own political philosophy.Bondurant, Joan. Conquest of Violence: The Gandhian Philosophy of Conflict. (Princeton, 1958) p 156. Later Gandhians, like the Indian nonviolence activist Vinoba Bhave, embraced the term as a name for the social movement in post-independence India which strove to ensure that self-determination and equality reached all strata of Indian society. Samantabhadra, an illustrious Digambara monk, as early as the 2nd century A.D., called the tƒ´rtha of MahƒÅvƒ´ra (24th Tirthankara) by the name sarvodaya.  Origins and Gandhi's political ideal  Gandhi received a copy of Ruskin's Unto This Last from a British friend, Mr. Henry Polak, while working as a lawyer in South Africa in 1904. In his Autobiography, Gandhi remembers the twenty-four-hour train ride to Durban (from when he first read the book), being so in the grip of Ruskin's ideas that he could not sleep at all: \\"I determined to change my life in accordance with the ideals of the book.\\"Autobiography, part IV, chapter xviii. As Gandhi construed it, Ruskin's outlook on political-economic life extended from three central tenets: Four years later, in 1908, Gandhi rendered a paraphrased translation of Ruskin's book into his native tongue of Gujarati. He entitled the book Sarvodaya, a compound (sandhi) he invented from two Sanskrit roots: sarva (all) and udaya (uplift) -- \\"the uplift of all\\" (or as Gandhi glossed it in his autobiography, \\"the welfare of all\\"). Although inspired by Ruskin, the term would for Gandhi come to stand for a political ideal of his own stamp. (Indeed, Gandhi was keen to distance himself from Ruskin's more conservative ideas.)See Bondurant (1958), pp. 156-159. The ideal which Gandhi strove to put into practice in his ashrams was, he hoped, one that he could persuade the whole of India to embrace, becoming a light to the other nations of the world. The Gandhian social ideal encompassed the dignity of labor, an equitable distribution of wealth, communal self-sufficiency and individual freedom.Bondurant (1958), chapter 5.  Sarvodaya movement  Gandhi's ideals have lasted well beyond the achievement of one of his chief projects, Indian independence (swaraj). His followers in India (notably, Vinoba Bhave) continued working to promote the kind of society that he envisioned, and their efforts have come to be known as the Sarvodaya Movement. Anima Bose has referred to the movement's philosophy as \\"a fuller and richer concept of people's democracy than any we have yet known.\\" Sarvodaya workers associated with Vinoba, Jaya Prakash Narayan, Dada Dharmadhikari, Ravishankar Maharaj, Dhirendra Mazumdaar, Shankarrao Deo, K. G. Mashruwala undertook various projects aimed at encouraging popular self-organisation during the 1950s and 1960s, including Bhoodan and Gramdan movements. Many groups descended from these networks continue to function locally in India today. Beginning on the one year anniversary of the immersion of Gandhi's ashes, an annual Sarvodaya mela or festival has been held at SrirangapatnaSharath S. Srivatsa, \\"A confluence by the Cauvery\\", The Hindu, 12 February 2006. and at Tirunavaya. At the latter site, it was instituted by K. Kelappan (Kelappaji).T.

Macquarie Street extends from Hyde Park at its southern end to the Sydney Opera House at its northern end. Apart from connecting these two major landmarks, the key government institutions of the state of New South Wales are all located on this street. History Macquarie Street is named after Lachlan Macquarie, an early Governor of New South Wales (in office 1810‚Äì1821). In the years since its founding in 1788, Sydney had developed organically, and by the early 1800s was lacking in major public buildings, and had a complex network of narrow streets. The supply of drinking water and waste management was also becoming an issue. Governor Macquarie initiated the construction of Sydney's first public buildings of any real permanence and set the boundaries of Sydney's grid of streets. With Circular Quay as the focus of this new civic scheme, Macquarie Street marked its eastern boundary and was designed as a ceremonial thoroughfare. The public buildings distributed either side of the street would both delineate and connect the civil and commercial town centre to its west with the green spaces (now the Domain and Royal Botanic Gardens) to the east. Among the public buildings commissioned by Macquarie, Hyde Park Barracks and St James' Church are two examples largely preserved from that era. The two buildings face each other across Queen's Square, at the southern end of Macquarie Street. The Sydney Hospital, after rebuilding was completed in 1894. Colonial Secretary's Building, while on the left is the gate of the Royal Botanic Gardens leading to Government House and the Government House stables (now the Sydney Conservatorium of Music) Upon laying out the street in 1810, Governor Macquarie also carved out land from the Domain for the building of Sydney Hospital, with its frontage on Macquarie Street. Due to the reluctance of the British government to provide funding, the building contract for the hospital provided for the government to provide convict labour, and for part of the project costs to be paid in the form of rum import monopolies, leading to the name the \\"Rum Hospital\\". The hospital buildings were completed in 1816. Although called \\"elegant and commodious\\" by some commentators, architect Francis Greenway criticised both the design and construction. As the only major hospital in the colony at the time, the hospital took up almost the entire eastern frontage of the southern half of Macquarie Street. However, the hospital's capacity exceeded the needs of Sydney at the time, and almost from the start space in its two wing buildings began to be occupied by various government institutions. The northern wing building was occupied by the Legislative Council and Executive Council, and was eventually expanded to become the Parliament House for New South Wales. The southern wing building became the Sydney Mint, among other functions. After Macquarie, subsequent governors and (after the establishment of responsible government in the colony) governments continued to regard Macquarie Street as the axis of an informal governmental and public precinct. The State Library of New South Wales, the Colonial Secretary's Building and the old Treasury Building, (now part of the InterContinental Hotel) are examples of such institutions. At the same time, as an elegant tree-lined boulevarde adjacent both to the commercial city centre and the green spaces of the Royal Botanic Gardens and the Domain, the street became Sydney's most pre-eminent residential address. In particular, the close proximity to Sydney Hospital and court buildings attracted leading barristers and doctors to set up chambers and surgeries along the street. In 1977, the New South Wales government built a new Law Courts Building at Queen's Square at the southern end of the street, to house the Supreme Court of New South Wales and the Sydney registries of the Federal Court of Australia and the High Court of Australia. Burdekin House, built in 1842 and described as the finest private residence in Sydney, was located on Macquarie Street. Its demolition became an early rallying point for the conservation movement in Sydney. St Stephen's Presbyterian Church was built in 1934 on the site of Burdekin House, after an earlier St Stephen's in Phillip Street was demolished for the creation of Martin Place. The Garden Palace, a grand building constructed for the 1879 International Exhibition of Sydney, was located on Macquarie Street, but was destroyed by fire only a few years later. Fort Macquarie in 1870. The northern section of Macquarie Street was initially a path through the Governor's Domain leading to Bennelong Point. After Government House was moved further up the hill, the path was widened and became part of Macquarie Street, leading to land to the west of the street being sold off for commercial development in the 1840s-1850s. Today, this northern section of Macquarie Street runs along the eastern side of Circular Quay. To the east of this northern section is the Royal Botanic Gardens, while to the west of the street, the historic sandstone Moore Stairs, built in 1868 leads to the waterfront.Moore Stairs In the past, this area was lined by warehouses and other shipping-related facilities focusing on the wool trade, leading to this section being called the \\"wool stores\\" end. At the end of the street was Bennelong Point. From 1821 this was the site of Fort Macquarie, which in 1901 was demolished to make way for the Fort Macquarie Tram Depot, which was eventually demolished in 1958 to make way for the Sydney Opera House. The warehouses and wharf facilities near the Opera House were progressively removed in the mid-20th century and replaced by modernist office blocks. In 1998, the Bennelong Apartments, a complex of contemporary buildings nicknamed \\"the Toaster\\", replaced the modernist office blocks. The complex includes private apartments, retail outlets, restaurants, the Pullman Quay Grand Hotel and a cinema. \\"Harley Street of Sydney\\" Because of the proliferation of medical chambers and surgeries, and the presence of a number of medical professional institutions, Macquarie Street was widely known as the Harley Street of Sydney from the late 19th century until recent decades. The Royal Australian College of Physicians Building at 145 Macquarie Street was the Georgian residence of John Fairfax until 1848. The British Medical Association's 1920s BMA House at 135-137 Macquarie Street still houses medical chambers and lecture hall. Government and public buildings Government House, located within the Royal Botanic Gardens, entry is from Macquarie Street Parliament House, near the southern terminus of Macquarie Street Free Public Library, corner of Bent & Macquarie, Sydney, 1877 Macquarie Street is the location of the main governmental institutions of New South Wales: Parliament House, Government House, and the Law Courts Building (which houses the Supreme Court of New South Wales) are all located along the street. \\"Macquarie Street\\" is used as a metonym for the New South Wales government (the way Whitehall, for example, is a metonym for the British government). Institutions of the Federal Government located along the street include the Sydney registries of the Federal Court of Australia and High Court of Australia, both in the Law Courts Building at Queen's Square, and the headquarters of the Reserve Bank of Australia. Macquarie Street is also the location of Sydney Hospital, the Hyde Park Barracks and St. James' Church, which were all built during Governor Macquarie's tenure. The historic Sydney Mint building, along with the entrance building to Parliament House, are preserved remnants of the original Sydney Hospital. The State Library of New South Wales is located on Macquarie Street, as are the historic Chief Secretary's Building and the old New South Wales Treasury (now part of the InterContinental Hotel). Within the Royal Botanic Gardens are Government House and the Sydney Conservatorium of Music, originally built as the Government House stables. At the northern terminus of Macquarie Street is the iconic Sydney Opera House. Past residents * 123‚Äì125 Macquarie Street (The Astor): Dame Eadith Walker DBE; David Wilson QC; Hugh D.

McTavish is best known for several head writing stints on All My Children. Early career Before becoming a writer, McTavish was a Chicago-based stage actress. She played Penelope in the National Radio Theater's Peabody Award-winning radio dramatization of Homer's Odyssey (1980). On television, McTavish broke into the soap opera industry as an actress; she played Lola Fontaine on Guiding Light from 1983 to 1984. Writing McTavish began her writing career as a staff writer on the Procter and Gamble Productions' Texas. (The show was notable for allowing actors to contribute as writers; its final head writer, Pam Long, had been portraying the front-burner role of Ashley). She also worked as a staff writer for the company's Guiding Light. McTavish was head writer of several shows. She was at Guiding Light from 1995 to 1996, at One Life to Live from 1999 to 2001, and at General Hospital from 2001 to 2002. However, she is best known for three separate stints at All My Children. McTavish was mentored by All My Children creator Agnes Nixon and her 1992 ascension to head writer was reported in the press as a change of the guard. McTavish wrote for AMC until 1995, and returned for two additional stints, from 1997 to 1999 and from 2003 to 2007. =Accomplishments and criticisms= McTavish's first stint on All My Children was her most critically and commercially successful. McTavish updated some of the existing characters and introduced new ones. She wrote several sweeping umbrella stories over the years, most notably a story where Pine Valley is hit by a tornado. During her third run as head writer, she penned a baby-swap story involving two of the show's young ingenues, Bianca Montgomery and Babe Carey. She created several popular characters, including Ryan Lavery during her second stint in 1998 and Kendall Hart in 1993, who were still cornerstones of the show until its series end. McTavish was criticized for various plot-driven stories during her tenures at All My Children. The 2003 Bianca rape storyline incited controversy when viewers and critics debated the storyline as an attempt by the writers to avoid onscreen physical intimacy between characters Bianca and Lena Kundera, as well as Bianca seemingly being punished for being a lesbian. She was criticized for rewriting history, such as the reversal of the landmark story where central character Erica Kane undergoes daytime's first abortion; McTavish rewrote the story to reveal that rather than having had an abortion, Erica's fetus was stolen and implanted into another woman's uterus, resulting with character Josh Madden. McTavish also rewrote history and the timeline of Erica's past to introduce character Kendall in the early 1990s, though this proved to be a popular story. Her decision to kill off character Dixie Cooney Martin in 2007 was criticized and cited as the \\"worst of 2007\\" by TV Guide.

Biography Born in Charolles, Sa√¥ne- et-Loire, he lived several years in Tahiti and India during the period 1865-1869. Jacolliot's Occult science in India was written during the 1860s and published 1875 (English translation 1884). Jacolliot was searching for the \\"Indian roots of western occultism\\" and makes reference to an otherwise unknown Sanskrit text he calls Agrouchada-Parikchai, which is apparently Jacolliot's personal invention, a \\"pastiche\\" of elements taken from Upanishads, Dharmashastras and \\"a bit of Freemasonry\\".Introduction to Occult Science in India by Louis Jacolliot [1919] at sacred-texts.com by J. B. Hare, June 21, 2008. Jacolliot also expounds his belief in a lost Pacific continent, and was quoted on this by Helena Blavatsky in Isis Unveiled in support of her own Lemuria. In Jacolliot's book La Bible dans l'Inde, Vie de Iezeus Christna (1869)L. Jacolliot (1869) La Bible dans l'Inde, Librairie Internationale, Paris (digitized by Google Books) (The Bible in India, or the Life of Iezeus Christna),Louis Jacolliot (1870) The Bible in India, Carleton, New York (digitized by Google Books) he compares the accounts of the life of Bhagavan Krishna with that of Jesus Christ in the Gospels and concludes that it could not have been a coincidence, so similar are the stories in so many details in his opinion. He concludes that the account in the Gospels is a myth based on the mythology of ancient India. Jacolliot does not claim that Jesus was in India as some have claimed. \\"Christna\\" is his way of spelling \\"Krishna\\" and he wrote that Krishna's disciples gave him the name \\"Iezeus\\" which means \\"pure essence\\" in Sanskrit.. However, Sanskrit philologist Max M√ºller confirmed that it is not a Sanskrit term at all and \\"it was simply invented\\" by Jacolliot.Max M√ºller (1888), Journal of the Transactions of the Victoria Institute Volume 21, page 179 Jacolliot was successfully sued for defamation by Father Honor√© Laval ss.cc, and ordered by the Supreme Court of the State of the Protectorate of the Society Islands to pay 15,000 francs in damages. It ordered the suppression of those portions of the pamphlet \\"La verit√© sur Tahiti\\" deemed defamatory, and further ordered that the judgement be printed in the official journal of the Protectorate in French, English, and Tahitian, as well as in three newspapers of the French colonies, three journals of Paris, and four gazettes of provinces of Laval's choosing.\\"Father Honore Laval and His Fellow- Laborers in the Pacific\\", Wellington Independent, Volume XXVII, Issue 3692, 31 December 1872, p. 3 He has been described as a prolific writer for his time.Voyage to the country of liberty: communal life in the United States, p. XI, Jacolliot, Paul Douglas, George MccoolL. Sprague de Camp, Lost Continents, 1954 (First Edition), p. 58 During his time in India he collected Sanskrit myths, which he popularized later starting in his Histoire des Vierges. Les Peuples et les continents disparus (1874). Among other things, he claimed that Hindu-writings (or unspecified \\"Sanskrit tablets\\") would tell the story of a sunken land called \\"Rutas\\" in the Indian Ocean. However, he relocated this lost continent to the Pacific Ocean and linked it to the Atlantis-myth. Furthermore, his \\"discovery\\" of Rutas is somehow similar to the origin of the Mu-Story. Among his works is a translation of the Manu Smriti. This work influenced Friedrich Nietzsche: see Tschandala. Between 1867 and 1876, he also translated select verses of the Tirukkural, an ancient Tamil classic on ethics and morality. He died in Saint-Thibault-des-Vignes, Seine-et-Marne.

The sessions took place at Phillips' Memphis Recording Service, in Memphis, Tennessee, during September and October 1953. Accompanying Parker on vocal is his backup band the \\"Blue Flames\\", whose members at the time are believed to have included: Floyd Murphy on guitar,Floyd Murphy is a brother of Matt \\"Guitar\\" Murphy. William Johnson on piano, Kenneth Banks on bass, John Bowers on drums, and Raymond Hill on tenor sax. \\"Mystery Train\\" was the follow-up single to Junior Parker's 1953 number five Billboard R&B; chart release \\"Feelin' Good\\".Sun Records number 187 The song did not reach the singles chart.

Portrait by J√≥zef Oleszkiewicz Marcin Odlanicki Poczobutt (; ) (30 October 1728 near Hrodna ‚Äì 7 February 1810 in Daugavpils) was a Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Jesuit, astronomer and mathematician. He was professor of Vilnius University for over 50 years, serving as its rector from 1780 to 1799. The Poczobutt crater on the Moon is named after him. Career Marcin Odlanicki Poczobutt was born in the village of S≈Çomianka (since 1945 in Belarus) near Grodno. He studied at Vilnius University (1745‚Äì1751) and Charles University in Prague (1754‚Äì1756). With brief interruptions he lectured at Vilnius University from 1753 to 1808. Sponsored by Micha≈Ç Fryderyk Czartoryski, he further studied in France, Italy, and Germany from 1762 to 1764. His stay at the Marseille Observatory under Esprit P√©zenas inspired him to devote his career to astronomy. He earned doctorate of philosophy, gained professorship, and became director of the Vilnius Astronomical Observatory in 1764. The observatory, established by Thomas Zebrowski, was in its early stages of development and Poczobutt worked hard to obtain modern instruments. Despite suppression of the Jesuits in 1773, the observatory gained royal favour from King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski‚Äîit was named royal observatory and Poczobutt became King's astronomer. In 1780, Poczobutt was appointed as university rector by the Commission of National Education. He was tasked with reforming the university from a medieval school concentrated on humanities (philosophy and theology) to a modern scientific institution. Under Poczobutt the university improved its science, medicine, and law departments. As rector of the university he promoted the use of Latin and opposed any use of Polish or Lithuanian languages. Scientific work He often travelled to London where he ordered astronomical equipment from Jesse Ramsden and John Dollond: a 4-foot transit telescope in 1765, 3.5-foot achromatic telescope in 1770, 8-foot mural quadrant in 1777, and meridian circle in 1788. Other purchases included octant, equatorial, two theodolites, 10-foot sextant. The observatory was expanded by architect Marcin Knackfus in 1782‚Äì1788 to accommodate the new equipment. Poczobutt observed solar and lunar eclipses, comets and asteroids (including Ceres, Pallas, Juno), and calculated geographic coordinates of settlements in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (including Vilnius and Hrodna). In addition, he made measurements of Mercury to compute its orbit; later this data was used by J√©r√¥me Lalande. He described 16-star constellation, which he named Taurus Poniatovii in honour of King Poniatowski (it is now obsolete and considered to be part of the Ophiuchus). His recorded observations amounted to 34 volumes. In 1770 he became the first in Lithuania to systematically measure and record weather temperature (continuous records survive since 1777). Poczobutt was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1771 and a corresponding member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1778. He was made a member of the Order of Saint Stanislaus in 1785 and Order of the White Eagle in 1793.

As well as scoring a UK top twenty trad jazz hit, he helped the careers of many musicians, notably the blues singer Ottilie Patterson, who was at one time his wife, and Lonnie Donegan, whose appearances with Barber triggered the skiffle craze of the mid-1950s and who had his first transatlantic hit, \\"Rock Island Line\\", while with Chris Barber's band. His providing an audience for Donegan and, later, Alexis Korner makes Barber a significant figure in the British rhythm and blues and \\"beat boom\\" of the 1960s. Biography =Early life= Barber was born in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, the son of a statistician father and headmistress mother. He was educated at Hanley Castle Grammar School, Malvern, Worcestershire, to the age of 15, then St Paul's School in London and the Guildhall School of Music. =Music career (1950s and 1960s)= Barber and Monty Sunshine (clarinet) formed a band in 1953, calling it Ken Colyer's Jazzmen to capitalise on their trumpeter's recent escapades in New Orleans: the group also included Donegan, Jim Bray (bass), Ron Bowden (drums) and Barber on trombone. In April 1953 the band made its debut in Copenhagen, Denmark. There Chris Albertson recorded several sides for the new Danish Storyville label, including some featuring only Sunshine (clarinet), Donegan (banjo) and Barber (bass) as the Monty Sunshine Trio. The bands played Dixieland jazz, and later ragtime, swing, blues and R&B.; Pat Halcox took over on trumpet in 1954 when Colyer moved on after musical differences and the band became \\"The Chris Barber Band\\". In 1959, the band's October 1956 recording of Sidney Bechet's \\"Petite Fleur\\", a clarinet solo by Monty Sunshine with Dick Smith on bass, Ron Bowden on drums and Dick Bishop on guitar, spent twenty- four weeks in the UK Singles Charts, making it to No. 3 and selling over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. After 1959 he toured the United States many times (where \\"Petite Fleur\\" charted at #5). Barber performing in Hamburg, 1972 In the late 1950s and early 1960s Barber was mainly responsible for arranging the first UK tours of blues artists Big Bill Broonzy, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee and Muddy Waters. This, with the encouragement of local enthusiasts such as Alexis Korner and John Mayall, sparked young musicians such as Peter Green, Eric Clapton and the Rolling Stones. British rhythm and blues powered the British invasion of the USA charts in the 1960s, yet Dixieland itself remained popular: in January 1963 the British music magazine, NME reported the biggest trad jazz event in Britain at Alexandra Palace. It included George Melly, Diz Disley, Acker Bilk, Alex Welsh, Kenny Ball, Ken Colyer, Sunshine, Bob Wallis, Bruce Turner, Mick Mulligan and Barber. Barber stunned traditionalists in 1964 by introducing blues guitarist John Slaughter into the line up who, apart from a break between April 1978 and August 1986, when Roger Hill took over the spot, played in the band until shortly before his death in 2010. Barber next added a second clarinet/saxophone and this line-up continued until 1999. Then Barber added fellow trombonist/arranger Bob Hunt and another clarinet and trumpet. This eleven-man \\"Big Chris Barber Band\\" offered a broader range of music while reserving a spot in the programme for the traditional six-man New Orleans line-up. A recording of the Lennon‚ÄìMcCartney composition \\"Catswalk\\" can be heard, retitled \\"Cat Call\\", on The Songs Lennon and McCartney Gave Away. Written by Paul McCartney the song was recorded in late July 1967 and released as a single in the UK on 20 October 1967. In 2014, Barber published his autobiography Jazz Me Blues with co-author Alyn Shipton. On 12 August 2019, Chris Barber announced his decision to retire after some 70 years of performing. The band will continue under the musical direction of Bob Hunt.\\"Important message provided by the management of Chris Barber\\", ChrisBarber.net, 12 August 2019. Retrieved 13 August 2019 The line up of the Big Chris Barber Band, which is carrying on with his full support (as of March 2020) is: Bob Hunt (trombone), Mike Henry and Gabriel Garrick (trumpets), Nick White, Trevor Whiting, and Ian Killoran (reeds), John Watson (drums), John Day (double bass), Joe Farler (banjo & guitar). =Long-term partnerships= Pat Halcox, trumpeter with the Chris Barber Band since 31 May 1954, retired after playing his last gig with the Big Chris Barber Band on 16 July 2008. Halcox and Barber were together in the band for 54 years ‚Äì the longest continuous partnership in the history of jazz, exceeding even that of Duke Ellington and Harry Carney (48 years between 1926 and 1974). Tony Carter (reeds) also left the band at this time. John Crocker (reeds) retired from the band in 2003 after a 30-year stint. Vic Pitt (double bass) retired in January 2007 after 30 years with the band. His feature duet with the drummers of the day ‚Äì \\"Big Noise From Winnetka\\" was not only a feature of the Barber concerts, but also his time with the Kenny Ball band immediately before.

Protein S, a vitamin K-dependent physiological anticoagulant, acts as a nonenzymatic cofactor to activate protein C in the degradation of factor Va and factor VIIIa. Decreased (antigen) levels or impaired function of protein S leads to decreased degradation of factor Va and factor VIIIa and an increased propensity to venous thrombosis. Protein S circulates in human plasma in two forms: approximately 60 percent is bound to complement component C4b Œ≤-chain while the remaining 40 percent is free, only free protein S has activated protein C cofactor activity Signs and symptoms Among the possible presentation of protein S deficiency are: Cause Human Chr 3 In terms of the cause of protein S deficiency it can be in inherited via autosomal dominance. A mutation in the PROS1 gene triggers the condition. The cytogenetic location of the gene in question is chromosome 3, specifically 3q11.1 Protein S deficiency can also be acquired due to vitamin K deficiency, treatment with warfarin, liver disease, and acute thrombosis (antiphospholipid antibodies may also be a cause as well) Pathophysiology In regards to the mechanism of protein S deficiency, Protein S is made in liver cells and the Endothelium. Protein S is a cofactor of APC both work to degrade factor V and factor VIII. It has been suggested that Zn2+ might be necessary for Protein S binding to factor Xa. Mutations in this condition change amino acids, which in turn disrupts blood clotting. Functional protein S is lacking, which normally turns off clotting proteins, this increases risk of blood clots.

It covers radio broadcasting in the long and medium wave bands outside the Americas (separate agreements being in place for North and South America). The plan was drawn up under the auspices of the World Administrative Radio Conference (WARC) of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) with the assistance of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU/UER). The Geneva plan replaced the 1948 Copenhagen plan. It became necessary because of the large number of broadcasting stations in these frequency ranges leading to ever more mutual interference (Many countries had refused to ratify the Copenhagen plan and compliance was patchy even among those which had). The Geneva plan entered into force on 23 November 1978 and although its intended lifespan was only until 1989, it is still valid (with small modification by mutual coordination between countries) today, and compliance has been far more widespread. Most existing European radio stations were required to change their broadcasting frequencies following implementation of the plan. In most cases the changes were slight (less than five kilohertz) but were more drastic in some cases, particularly in the United Kingdom, where all BBC national stations moved to a new wavelength or band. However the increased number of radio services and reduction (in most cases) of interference to radio signals (particularly at nighttime) was considered by most broadcasters to be worth the initial inconvenience. As a result of the plan most medium wave (and later longwave) stations outside North and South America operate on exact multiples of 9 kHz; the sum of all digits of the frequency will be 9 or a multiple of 9 (see 9#Mathematics).

It usually involves choosing your own tours over the open ice, sometimes in groups normally with safety equipment. Nordic skates differ significantly from the Dutch tour skates. = Nordic equipment = Nordic tour skates are fitted with a blade approximately 50 cm long and are attached with bindings to specialized boots similar to walking boots or cross country skiing boots, often with a free heel. Since tour skating often involves walking between lakes or around sections not suitable for skating, the fact that the blades can be easily removed from the boots is convenient. In addition the following safety equipment is often recommended: * ice prods or ice claws - a pair of metal spikes with handles like sharpened screwdrivers for hauling yourself out of holes in the ice * ice pike or hansa pole - a pole with a metal spike like a particularly sturdy ski pole used to test ice thickness * throwing line - a rope to be pulled out of the water by * backpack with waistband and groin strap containing a change of clothes in dry bags. This also acts as a buoyancy aid. Knee and elbow pads and a helmet are also commonly used.

Next the somewhat larger lakes freeze and become skateable. Light snow does not necessarily prevent skating and in some places tracks are ploughed to keep them open. In January‚ÄìFebruary parts of the archipelago in the Baltic sea often freeze. This is the time when long skating tours can be undertaken. Tours of 60‚Äì80 km in one day are not uncommon - some skate over 150 km. = Associations = Sweden's largest tour skating association is \\"The Stockholm Ice Skate Sailing and Touring Club\\" (SSSK). Finland's largest tour skating association is Finland's Tour Skaters.skrinnari.fi Several associations in Sweden, Finland, Norway, Netherlands, and U.S.A. are members of Skridskon√§tet. Through Skridskon√§tet, the members of the various associations share information on where ice suitable for skating can be found. Skridskon√§tet also maintains a list of tour skating clubs in mainly Sweden, Finland and the Netherlands.  Dutch (toer)skating  Two tour skating styles: Netherlands (left) and Nordic (right), on a canal in the Netherlands Modern Dutch tour skates In the Netherlands, the Dutch skating is called Toerschaatsen, where skaters follow marked routes on frozen canals and lakes, which are coordinated by the Royal Netherlands Skating Union.Touring and Marathon Skating from Virtual Skate Museum Despite its maritime climate in which real cold winters are rare, skating is traditionally the most popular winter pastime in the Netherlands even if many speed skating competitions have been moved indoors. Thousands of Dutch leap at the chance in cold winters to tie up their skates and glide across frozen lakes and canals, and sports stores all over the country sell out their skates. =Dutch equipment= The skaters mostly use common such skates with long blades or speed skates, with long blades rigidly attached to the skating shoes. Ice-poles and other safety equipment are not carried. =Dutch skating tracks= The Netherlands is home of Elfstedentocht, a 200 km distance skating race of which the tracks leads through the 11 different cities in Friesland which is a northern province of the Netherlands. Skate tracks on natural ice are maintained by the towns and communities, who take care of the safety of the tracks.  Outdoor skating in Canada  = Overview = In Canada, outdoor skating on natural frozen lake and ponds is common but not as a method of travel or tourism, rather people with skate in a circular route around the lake, or create an improvised ice hockey rink for a game of \\"shinny\\". However, starting in 1971, the section of the Rideau Canal that runs through the centre of Ottawa, the national capital, has been used as a skating corridor. This has become a major tourist attraction and a popular method of commuting in with Ottawa's locals. In 2011 932,331 people used the skateway. Starting in the 1990s The Forks area of Winnipeg, where two rivers join, has also been used as a skating trail, and by 2008 was longer than the Rideau skateway (though much narrower). Due to natural variations in ice conditions, the Assiniboine Credit Union River Trail, as it is officially called varies in length each year. Similar plans to turn Montreal's Lachine Canal into a skating venue have been discussed since 2000, but were still awaiting the needed funding in 2012. In Joliette, Quebec, two parallel skating tracks, of 4 km each, on the L'Assomption River are linked to form a loop running through the center of the town. In Invermere, British Columbia, there is a 15 km skating track on Windermere Lake. = List of Woodland skating / Ice-skating trails in Canada = * Arrowhead Provincial Park Ice Skating Trail (Huntsville, Ontario) * Jasper Park Lodge Oval Trail (Lake Mildred, Alberta) * Lac-des-Loups (Lac-des-Loups, Quebec) * Lake Windermere Whiteway (Invermere, British Columbia) * MacGregor Point Park Ice Skating Loop (Port Elgin, Ontario) * Magog Skating Trail (Quebec, Lake Mephr√©magog) * Red River Mutual Trail (Winnipeg, Manitoba) * Rideau Canal Skateway (Ottawa, Ontario) * Shipyards Park Skating Loop (Whitehorse, Yukon) * Skateway on the Rivi√®re l‚ÄôAssomption (Joliette, Quebec) * Valens Conservation Area (Valens, Ontario) = Historical Long Distance Skating in Canada = Long distance skating on lakes and rivers in eastern Canada and north-eastern USA was more common in the years between 1850 and 1900. One region of note was the lower reaches of the Saint John River in New Brunswick. In Saint John: A Sporting Tradition, Brian Flood writes: > However, on the soles of the hearty ladies and gentlemen who lived along the > St John and Kennebecasis Rivers, there was a different type of skate.

In the circulation, Protein S exists in two forms: a free form and a complex form bound to complement protein C4b-binding protein (C4BP). In humans, protein S is encoded by the PROS1 gene. History Protein S is named for Seattle, Washington, where it was originally discovered and purified by Earl Davie's group in 1977. Structure Protein S is partly homologous to other vitamin K-dependent plasma coagulation proteins, such as protein C and factors VII, IX, and X. Similar to them, it has a Gla domain and several EGF-like domains (four rather than two), but no serine protease domain. Instead, there is a large C-terminus domain that is homologous to plasma steroid hormone-binding proteins such as sex hormone-binding globulin and corticosteroid-binding globulin. It may play a role in the protein functions as either a cofactor for activated protein C (APC) or in binding C4BP. Additionally, protein S has a peptide between the Gla domain and the EGF-like domain, that is cleaved by thrombin. The Gla and EGF-like domains stay connected after the cleavage by a disulfide bond. However, protein S loses its function as an APC cofactor following either this cleavage or binding C4BP. Function The best characterized function of Protein S is its role in the anti coagulation pathway, where it functions as a cofactor to Protein C in the inactivation of Factors Va and VIIIa. Only the free form has cofactor activity. Protein S binds to negatively charged phospholipids via the carboxylated Gla domain. This property allows Protein S to facilitate the removal of cells that are undergoing apoptosis, a form of structured cell death used by the body to remove unwanted or damaged cells. In healthy cells, an ATP (adenosine triphosphate)-dependent enzyme removes negatively charged phospholipids such as phosphatidyl serine from the outer leaflet of the cell membrane. An apoptotic cell (that is, one undergoing apoptosis) no longer actively manages the distribution of phospholipids in its outer membrane and hence begins to display negatively charged phospholipids on its exterior surface. These negatively charged phospholipids are recognized by phagocytes such as macrophages. Protein S binds to the negatively charged phospholipids and functions as a bridge between the apoptotic cell and the phagocyte. This bridging expedites phagocytosis and allows the cell to be removed without giving rise to inflammation or other signs of tissue damage. Protein S also binds to the nascent complement complex C5,6,7 and prevents this complex from inserting into a membrane. This function prevents the inappropriate activation of the complement system, which would cause uncontrolled systemic inflammation. In fact, Protein S was first discovered in 1977 in this role and it is named after the membrane site that it occupies in the complex. Pathology Mutations in the PROS1 gene can lead to Protein S deficiency which is a rare blood disorder which can lead to an increased risk of thrombosis. Interactions Protein S has been shown to interact with Factor V.

It is the story of Titus Groan, 77th Earl of Groan and Lord of Gormenghast Castle, from age 7 to 17. As the story opens, Titus dreads the pre-ordained life of ritual that stretches before him. To Titus, Master of Ritual Barquentine and his apprentice Steerpike are the embodiment of all he wants to rebel against. An important sub-plot involves Titus at school, where he encounters the professors, especially Bellgrove, who becomes Headmaster of Gormenghast school. Plot summary =Steerpike usurps Barquentine= Steerpike, despite his position of authority, is in reality a dangerous traitor to Gormenghast who seeks to eventually wield ultimate power in the castle. To this end, he kills Barquentine so that he can replace him and so advance in power. Although he is successful in his murder of Barquentine, the old master of ritual put up such a severe struggle that Steerpike is severely injured in the process, suffering extensive burns and almost drowning. As Steerpike lies recovering in a delirious state from his ordeal, he cries out the words And the twins will make it five.Chapter 48 This is overheard by the castle's doctor, Dr Prunesquallor, who is greatly disturbed to hear it. Although the reader is not told this explicitly, Steerpike's words are a clear reference to the number of people he has killed. The reference to the twins is to the aunts of Titus, the twin sisters Ladies Cora and Clarice. Steerpike has effectively been holding them captive in a remote and abandoned part of the castle, and they are utterly dependent on him for food and drink. Due to Steerpike's prolonged recovery he is unable to supply them (and at some level Steerpike is aware of this, even in his delirium), and by the time he has recovered he believes them to have probably already died of thirst and starvation, though in fact they die a few days later. Dr Prunesquallor discusses Steerpike's words with the Countess Gertrude, but they disagree over its meaning and the ambiguity over exactly what Steerpike meant is never resolved.Chapter 54 Nevertheless, both of them are now thoroughly suspicious about Steerpike and his role in the various disappearances and deaths among the happenings of the castle. Although Steerpike appears to make a full recovery, he is left disfigured with a morbid fear of fire. It also becomes clear that the balance of his mind is increasingly disturbed. =The professors= An important part of Titus' life is spent at school, where he encounters the school professors, especially Bellgrove, one of Titus's teachers, who eventually ascends to Headmaster of Gormenghast. The other teachers are a collection of misfits, each with idiosyncrasies of their own, who bicker and compete with each other in petty rivalries, being not unlike a bunch of overgrown schoolboys themselves. A welcome humorous interlude in the novel occurs when Irma Prunesquallor (sister of the castle's doctor), decides to get married, and throws a party in the hope of meeting a suitable partner. To this end she invites the school professors, who are so terrified of meeting a woman that they make fools of themselves in various ways. One professor faints at the prospect of having to speak to Irma and has to be revived by the doctor. When he wakes up he flees naked and shrieking over the garden wall, never to be seen again. Only Bellgrove, recently made headmaster, rises to the occasion and behaves in a gentlemanly way to Irma. Bellgrove and Irma thus begin a rather unusual romance. Bellgrove becomes an important figure in Titus' development. In many respects, he is the standard absent-minded professor who falls asleep during his own class and plays with marbles. However, deep inside him there is a certain element of dignity and nobility. At heart Bellgrove is kindly, and if weak, at least has the humility to be aware of his faults. He becomes something of a father figure to Titus. =The Thing= An important development for Titus is his brief meeting with his \\"foster sister\\": a feral girl known only as 'The Thing', the daughter of Titus' wet-nurse, Keda of the Bright Carvers. The Thing, being an illegitimate child, is exiled by the Carvers and lives a feral life in the forests around Gormenghast. Titus first meets her when he escapes from the confines of Gormenghast into the outside world. Titus is entranced by her wild grace, and sets out to meet her. He does so, and holds her briefly, but she flees him and is fatally struck by lightning. However, her fierce independence inspires Titus, and gives him courage to later leave his home. =The unmasking of Steerpike= Due to the vigilance of the old servant Flay Steerpike is eventually unmasked as the murderer of the aunts of Titus, Cora and Clarice. He becomes a renegade within the castle, using his extensive knowledge to hide within its vast regions, and waging a guerrilla campaign of random killing with his catapult. Steerpike's capture seems impossible until the entire kingdom of Gormenghast is submerged in a flood, due to endless rains. The mud dwellers are forced to take refuge in the castle and the castle's own inhabitants are also forced to retreat to higher and higher floors as the flood waters keep rising. Fuchsia, grown increasingly melancholic and withdrawn after the death of her father and betrayal by Steerpike, briefly contemplates suicide. At the last moment, she changes her mind, but slips and falls from a window, striking her head on the way down and drowning in the floodwaters. Unaware of the accident when they find her body, both Countess Gertrude and Titus are convinced that Steerpike is to blame, and both resolve to bring the murderer to justice. So begins an epic manhunt through the rapidly flooding castle, with Steerpike forced into ever smaller areas and eventually surrounded by the castle's forces. Even at this late stage, his ruthlessness and cunning mean that Steerpike almost evades capture. However, Titus realises that he is hiding in the ivy against the castle walls, and full of rage and hatred against Steerpike he pursues and kills him himself. Despite being hailed as a hero, Titus is intent on leaving Gormenghast to explore a wider world, and the novel ends with him dramatically riding away to seek his fortune in the unknown lands outside. Mark Robertson's cover illustration for the Mandarin paperback edition Other minor characters The Poet: Known only by his professional name, the Poet holds a relatively important function of ritual in the castle. He is described as having a wedge-shaped head and a voice \\"as strange and deep as a lugubrious ocean\\". After Barquentine's death and Steerpike's unmasking as a traitor, he is hastily appointed as the new Master of Ritual. Bright Carvers or Mud Dwellers: Hereditary population of the extensive Mud Village situated up against and outside the walls of Gormenghast Castle, who are famed for their skill in woodcarving.

Spends most of his time asleep in a tall high chair on wheels, pushed around by his assistant, the Fly. He is killed whilst organising the search for Titus when the Fly slips and accidentally tips him out of his high chair onto his head. Bellgrove immediately assumes command of the School. (The) Fly: Deadyawn's assistant. His main function appears to push Deadyawn around in his high chair and keep his hot water bottle topped up. After accidentally killing his master he leaps out of a window to his death. The Leader: School professor. Only known as \\"The Leader\\", this ancient bearded character proposes a philosophy where everything in this world is an illusion ‚Äì even including sensations such as pain.

A gyrotron is a class of high-power linear-beam vacuum tubes which generates millimeter-wave electromagnetic waves by the cyclotron resonance of electrons in a strong magnetic field. Output frequencies range from about 20 to 527 GHz, covering wavelengths from microwave to the edge of the terahertz gap. Typical output powers range from tens of kilowatts to 1‚Äì2 megawatts. Gyrotrons can be designed for pulsed or continuous operation. The gyrotron was invented by soviet scientistsHigh-Magnetic-Field Research and Facilies (1979). Washington, D.C.: National Academy of Sciences. p. 51. at NIRFI, based in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia. Principle of operation Diagram of a gyrotron The gyrotron is a type of free-electron maser which generates high- frequency electromagnetic radiation by stimulated cyclotron resonance of electrons moving through a strong magnetic field. It can produce high power at millimeter wavelengths because as a fast-wave device its dimensions can be much larger than the wavelength of the radiation. This is unlike conventional microwave vacuum tubes such as klystrons and magnetrons, in which the wavelength is determined by a single-mode resonant cavity, a slow-wave structure, and thus as operating frequencies increase, the resonant cavity structures must decrease in size, which limits their power-handling capability. In the gyrotron a hot filament in an electron gun at one end of the tube emits an annular-shaped (hollow tubular) beam of electrons, which is accelerated by a high-voltage anode and then travels through a large tubular resonant cavity structure in a strong axial magnetic field, usually created by a superconducting magnet around the tube. The field causes the electrons to move helically in tight circles around the magnetic field lines as they travel lengthwise through the tube. At the position in the tube where the magnetic field reaches its maximum the electrons radiate electromagnetic waves in a transverse direction (perpendicular to the axis of the tube) at their cyclotron resonance frequency. The millimeter radiation forms standing waves in the tube, which acts as an open-ended resonant cavity, and is formed into a beam, which radiates through a window in the side of the tube into a waveguide. The spent electron beam is absorbed by a collector electrode at the end of the tube. As in other linear-beam microwave tubes, the energy of the output electromagnetic waves comes from the kinetic energy of the electron beam, which is due to the accelerating anode voltage. In the region before the resonant cavity where the magnetic field strength is increasing, it compresses the electron beam, converting the longitudinal drift velocity to transverse orbital velocity, in a process similar to that occurring in a magnetic mirror used in plasma confinement. The orbital velocity of the electrons is 1.5 to 2 times their axial beam velocity. Due to the standing waves in the resonant cavity, the electrons become \\"bunched\\"; that is, their phase becomes coherent (synchronized) so they are all at the same point in their orbit at the same time. Therefore, they emit coherent radiation. The electron speed in a gyrotron is slightly relativistic (on the order of but not close to the speed of light). This contrasts to the free-electron laser (and xaser) that work on different principles and whose electrons are highly relativistic. Applications Gyrotrons are used for many industrial and high-technology heating applications. For example, gyrotrons are used in nuclear fusion research experiments to heat plasmas and also in manufacturing industry as a rapid heating tool in processing glass, composites, and ceramics, as well as for annealing (solar and semiconductors). Military applications include the Active Denial System. Types The output window of the tube from which the microwave beam emerges can be in two locations. In the transverse-output gyrotron, the beam exits through a window in the side of the tube. This requires a 45¬∞ mirror at the end of the cavity to reflect the microwave beam, positioned at one side so the electron beam misses it. In the axial-output gyrotron, the beam exits through a window in the end of the tube at the far end of the cylindrical collector electrode which collects the electrons. The original gyrotron developed in 1964 was an oscillator, but since that time gyrotron amplifiers have been developed. The helical gyrotron electron beam can amplify an applied microwave signal similarly to the way a straight electron beam amplifies in classical microwave tubes such as the klystron, so there are a series of gyrotrons which function analogously to these tubes. Their advantage is that they can operate at much higher frequencies. The gyro- monotron (gyro-oscillator) is a single-cavity gyrotron that functions as an oscillator. A gyro-klystron is an amplifier that functions analogously to a klystron tube. Has two microwave cavities along the electron beam, an input cavity upstream to which the signal to be amplified is applied and an output cavity downstream from which the output is taken. A gyro-TWT is an amplifier that functions analogously to a travelling wave tube (TWT). It has a slow wave structure similar to a TWT paralleling the beam, with the input microwave signal applied to the upstream end and the amplified output signal taken from the downstream end. A gyro-BWO is an oscillator that functions analogously to a backward wave oscillator (BWO). It generates oscillations traveling in an opposite direction to the electron beam, which are output at the upstream end of the tube. A gyro-twystron is an amplifier that functions analogouly to a twystron, a tube that combines a klystron and a TWT.

It is the oldest Czech daily still in print.The Czech media landscape‚Äîprint media It is a national news daily covering political, economic, cultural and scientific affairs, mostly with a centre-right, conservative view. It often hosts commentaries and opinions of prominent personalities from the Czech Republic and from abroad. History and profile Lidov√© noviny was founded by Adolf Str√°nsk√Ω in 1893 in Brno. Its high prestige was due to the number of famous Czech personalities that were contributing‚Äîwriters, politicians and philosophers‚Äîand its attention toward foreign politics and culture. It was also the first Czech daily publishing political cartoons. Its publication was interrupted during World War II and was closed down in 1952. In 1987 a group of political dissidents led by Ji≈ô√≠ Ruml, Ji≈ô√≠ Dienstbier, Ladislav Hejd√°nek, and Jan Petr√°nek recommenced the publication in a monthly samizdat version. In the autumn two \\"zero editions\\" were published and in January 1988 the first edition was issued. The paper has its headquarters in Prague. Since November 1989 it is being published legally and since the spring 1990 as a daily. Some years later it was merged with dissolving Lidov√° demokracie, from which they inherited the blue colour of the title. In 1998 Lidov√© noviny became part of the German group Rheinisch-Bergische Druckerei und Verlagsgesellschaft GmbH (the publisher of the daily Rheinische Post in Germany) and its Czech subsidiary Mafra a.s., that is also publisher of the second largest Czech daily Mlad√° fronta Dnes, the Czech edition of the freesheet Metro, the TV music channel √ìƒçko, the radio stations Expresradio and R√°dio Classic FM and the weekly music magazine Filter. In 2013, MAFRA a.s. became a subsidiary of the Agrofert group, a company owned by the Czech Prime Minister (as of 2018), Andrej Babi≈°. The publisher of the daily is Lidov√© noviny AS. The paper is published in Berliner format. Circulation Lidov√© noviny had a circulation of 270,000 copies in June 1990. The circulation of the paper was 91,000 copies in 2002. In October 2003, the paper had a circulation of 77,558 copies. In December 2004 the paper had a circulation of 70,593 copies. It was 72,000 copies for 2004 as a whole. The 2007 circulation of the paper was 70,680 copies. In 2008 it had a circulation of 70,413 copies and reached up to 232,000 readers per day.

Computational systems biologyAndres Kriete, Roland Eils, Computational Systems Biology, Elsevier Academic Press, 2006. aims to develop and use efficient algorithms, data structures, visualization and communication tools with the goal of computer modelling of biological systems. It involves the use of computer simulations of biological systems, including cellular subsystems (such as the networks of metabolites and enzymes which comprise metabolism, signal transduction pathways and gene regulatory networks), to both analyze and visualize the complex connections of these cellular processes. An unexpected emergent property of a complex system may be a result of the interplay of the cause-and-effect among simpler, integrated parts (see biological organisation). Biological systems manifest many important examples of emergent properties in the complex interplay of components. Traditional study of biological systems requires reductive methods in which quantities of data are gathered by category, such as concentration over time in response to a certain stimulus. Computers are critical to analysis and modelling of these data. The goal is to create accurate real-time models of a system's response to environmental and internal stimuli, such as a model of a cancer cell in order to find weaknesses in its signalling pathways, or modelling of ion channel mutations to see effects on cardiomyocytes and in turn, the function of a beating heart. Standards By far the most widely accepted standard format for storing and exchanging models in the field is the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML)Klipp, Liebermeister, Helbig, Kowald and Schaber. (2007). \\"Systems biology standards‚Äîthe community speaks\\" (2007), Nature Biotechnology 25(4):390‚Äì391. The SBML.org website includes a guide to many important software packages used in computational systems biology. A large number of models encoded in SBML can be retrieved from BioModels.

Note that the two populations exhibit cyclic behaviour. Creating a cellular model has been a particularly challenging task of systems biology and mathematical biology. It involves the use of computer simulations of the many cellular subsystems such as the networks of metabolites, enzymes which comprise metabolism and transcription, translation, regulation and induction of gene regulatory networks. The complex network of biochemical reaction/transport processes and their spatial organization make the development of a predictive model of a living cell a grand challenge for the 21st century, listed as such by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in 2006.American Association for the Advancement of Science A whole cell computational model for the bacterium Mycoplasma genitalium, including all its 525 genes, gene products, and their interactions, was built by scientists from Stanford University and the J.

Every two years, the performance of current methods is assessed in the CASP experiment. =Human biological systems= Brain model The Blue Brain Project is an attempt to create a synthetic brain by reverse-engineering the mammalian brain down to the molecular level. The aim of this project, founded in May 2005 by the Brain and Mind Institute of the √âcole Polytechnique in Lausanne, Switzerland, is to study the brain's architectural and functional principles. The project is headed by the Institute's director, Henry Markram.

Most current models describe effects on one of many different levels of biological organization (e.g. organisms or populations). A challenge is the development of models that predict effects across biological scales. Ecotoxicology and models discusses some types of ecotoxicological models and provides links to many others. =Modelling of infectious disease= It is possible to model the progress of most infectious diseases mathematically to discover the likely outcome of an epidemic or to help manage them by vaccination.

The building was used by the Municipal Borough of Hornsey as its headquarters until 1966. It is a Grade II* listed building. History =Early history= In the late 19th century the local board of health had used offices in Southwood Lane in Highgate which had been specially built for them in May 1869. After Hornsey had became an urban district in 1894 and then been incorporated as a municipal borough in 1903, civic leaders decided this arrangement was inadequate for their needs and that they would procure a purpose-built town hall: the site selected for the new facility in Broadway had previously been occupied by properties known as Broadway Hall and Lake Villa. The foundation stone was laid by the mayor, Councillor William Grimshaw, on 29 November 1934. Hornsey Town Hall was the first major UK building to be constructed in the Modernist style. Designed by New Zealand born architect Reginald Uren for the Municipal Borough of Hornsey, the building shows the influence of Hilversum town hall in the Netherlands and the design was awarded a bronze medal by the Royal Institute of British Architects. It was built by Gee, Walker & Slater and opened by the Duke and Duchess of Kent on 4 November 1935. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with seven bays facing onto a small courtyard in Hatherley Gardens with a wing of six bays enclosing the courtyard to the right; the main frontage featured wide steps leading up to three doorways with a canopy above on the ground floor; the were seven tall windows on the first floor with a wrought-iron balcony in front of the central three windows. A tall tower with a flag pole was erected at the corner of the courtyard. Internally, the principal rooms were the council chamber, the mayor's parlour and the committee room. The building continued to be the headquarters of the Municipal Borough of Hornsey for much of the 20th century but ceased to be the local seat of government when the London Borough of Haringey was formed in 1965. The town hall was used instead for concerts and even hosted the singer, Freddie Mercury, in February 1971. In 1981 it became one of the first of the buildings constructed in the 1930s to achieve listed building status. =Redevelopment= After deciding that the town hall was surplus to requirements, the London Borough of Haringey commissioned a generic redevelopment scheme to renovate the town hall and build flats behind it, securing planning permission for that scheme in 2010. In 2011 the London Borough of Haringey agreed to lease the town hall to Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts on a 125-year lease. Early feasibility studies indicated that the cost of renovating and converting the Grade II* listed building would be ¬£19 million. In June 2012 Mountview was awarded ¬£500,000 by the Heritage Lottery Fund for initial development work, a sum which was matched with a further ¬£500,000 from Mountview's own reserves. Following a tender procurement process advertised in the Official Journal of the European Union, Mountview appointed architects Purcell to develop plans for the site to include publicly accessible theatres, acting and dance studios, production arts workshops and student welfare facilities. However, an independent review carried out in 2015 revealed that the cost of developing the site would greater than originally anticipated and beyond the combined affordability of Haringey Council and Mountview. Mountview committed to finding an alternative site for its new home, but after a suitable site could not be identified in Haringey, Mountview announced a partnership with Southwark London Borough Council to create a new purpose-built home on a town centre site in Peckham in south London. In November 2015 the London Borough of Haringey offered the town hall on a 125-year lease to anyone who would take on responsibility to develop residential accommodation on the site and allocate some of the proceeds to restoring the building. A group of local people formed themselves into the Hornsey Town Hall Appreciation Society in the hope of taking the town hall into community ownership and secured 2,501 signatures on a petition to achieve that objective. However the London Borough of Haringey felt unable to sell the property at an undervalue and invited the Hornsey Town Hall Appreciation Society to participate in a commercial bid being organised by an alliance of local community groups known as the Hornsey Town Hall Community Interest Company. The venture was not successful and the Hornsey Town Hall Community Interest Company was dissolved on 6 November 2018. In October 2019, the Far East International Consortium, a developer selected by Haringey Council, began restoration works on the building. The restoration work, which was carried out to a design by Donald Insall Associates, involved reupholstered leather seating in the council chamber and repairs to the signage, metal balustrading, parquet flooring and terrazzo flooring. Use as film and TV location The modernist style and Art Deco interior of the Town Hall has proved popular as a location for film and TV productions. This includes regular appearances as the police station in the 2009 gothic crime drama Whitechapel, as well as featuring in the 2011 BBC drama series The Hour and the British TV drama series Killing Eve (in which it represented a grand Moscow hotel).

It is the third work in the Gormenghast trilogy. The other works are Titus Groan, and Gormenghast. With the trilogy, a fourth work, the novella Boy in Darkness, and a fifth, the fragment Titus Awakes, are often considered part of a larger \\"Gormenghast series\\". It was re-edited by Langdon Jones in 1970 using the original manuscript. Plot summary The story follows Titus as he journeys through the world outside Gormenghast Castle, having left his home at the end of the second book. =Muzzlehatch and the city= Titus bumbles through a desert for a time, then uses a canoe to row down the river, where the reader gets a surprise: although Gormenghast is a crumbling, medieval castle, Titus finds himself in a modern city. Skyscrapers tower and the river itself is covered in pipes, canals and fishermen. As he slips the painter on the canoe, he has his first encounter with two faceless, silent persons, ostensibly police officers. Titus is exhausted by this stage and collapses on the city's waterfront, where he is rescued by a man named Muzzlehatch, who runs a zoo and drives a shark-shaped car. When Titus has recovered, he becomes restless and leaves Muzzlehatch's home to explore the city. He comes upon various huge glass and steel buildings, and arrives at a vast circular plaza of grey marble, which he begins to cross. At the far side of the plaza is a kind of airfield where brightly coloured flying machines land and take off. One of the flying machines starts to pursue Titus and he crosses the plaza hurriedly and runs into a large building to escape. He climbs to the top of the building and observes through a skylight that a party is taking place. He watches the party, overhearing various strange and disjointed conversations, until by accident he breaks the skylight, and falls through onto the ground. Titus only avoids arrest at this stage because he is lucky enough to have landed at the feet of Juno, who is Muzzlehatch's ex-lover. Juno and Muzzlehatch (who is also at the party) hide Titus until the police are gone. Nevertheless Titus is later arrested anyway, and brought to trial before a magistrate. He only avoids being sent to an institution for offenders by Juno agreeing to be his guardian and taking him in to live with her. Mark Robertson's cover illustration for the Mandarin paperback edition =Juno and the Under-River= Titus then goes to stay with Juno, who lives by herself in a beautiful mansion. Although she is at least twice his age, after a short while they become lovers. There follows a blissful period when the two lovers live together joyfully, but Titus again becomes restless and decides to leave Juno. He parts from Juno and heads out once more to explore the city, where he is followed by a mysterious floating orb, which appears to have an intelligence of its own. Titus becomes frightened and angry towards the grey, translucent orb, and flings his Gormenghast flint (his only token of home) at it, smashing the orb into pieces. He then flees to Muzzlehatch's house. Muzzlehatch informs Titus that the scientists are furious because of the destruction of their orb ‚Äì their greatest achievement ‚Äì and that Titus's life is now in danger. He gives Titus directions to the hidden world of the Under-River and urges Titus to flee there. The Under-River is a hidden region of tunnels and halls under the city's river, filled with outcasts, runaways and derelicts. When he gets there, Titus has an encounter with an ex-prison camp warden called Veil, who is abusing a woman companion, an ex-prisoner called the Black Rose. Titus and Veil start to fight over the Black Rose, and Titus is about to be killed when Muzzlehatch appears and kills Veil. Muzzlehatch reveals that the scientists have killed all the animals in his zoo, using some sort of death-ray. Muzzlehatch and Titus then bring the Black Rose out of the Under-River region to Juno's house to recover from her abuse. Titus then flees the city, and Muzzlehatch also leaves, seeking revenge on the scientists. Despite their efforts, the Black Rose dies as soon as they are gone, and Juno is forced to provide an excuse to the city authorities for her presence. After she has dealt with this, Juno then encounters a red-haired man at the bottom of her garden, who tells her that he has been living in the woods beside Juno's house, watching and waiting for her for a long time. Despite him being a stalker of some kind, Juno takes up with the mysterious man, whom she decides to call \\"Anchor\\" (he will not tell her his real name). They leave Juno's house and the city together in Anchor's car, in search of adventure. =Cheeta and the factory= Titus resumes his wanderings and is eventually found in a state of fever by a woman named Cheeta, who nurses him back to health. While he is in a fever Titus continually talks about his past, and as a result, Cheeta learns all about Gormenghast by listening to him. When he has recovered, Titus becomes infatuated with Cheeta, who is very beautiful and also very rich. Cheeta is described as a \\"modern girl\\" with \\"a new kind of beauty\\", who flies a helicopter. Titus lusts for her because he has spent all his life in a straitlaced medieval castle, and Cheeta lives like science incarnate. She is the daughter of a scientist who runs a huge modern factory next to a lake. When Titus first sees the factory from a distance it looks sleek and impressive, but as he gets closer he notices that it gives off a strange unnerving hum, and a sickly sweet smell of death. As he first looks closely at the factory he notices an identical face looking at him from every window, and when a whistle blows they all instantly disappear. He is repulsed by the factory and begins to feel uneasy about Cheeta. Although Titus lusts for Cheeta, he also tells her several times that he hates her and tells her to \\"go home to your horde of vestal virgins and forget me as I shall forget you\\". Cheeta is shocked because other men would give anything for her favour. She contrives an elaborate plan to lure him into the \\"Black House\\", to see \\"a hundred bright inventions\\", and end their relationship on a high note. There, she attempts to recreate Gormenghast horrendously in order to humiliate Titus and drive him insane, but she is foiled by Muzzlehatch. Muzzlehatch has arrived at the Black House in order to confront Cheeta's father, the scientist, for his role in the murder of his animals. He reveals that he has sabotaged Cheeta's father's factory, and a few moments later it is destroyed in a huge explosion that rocks the Black House and covers the sky in a filthy orange cloud. Muzzlehatch is then killed by the helmeteers (see below), who are in turn killed by Anchor and the trio from the Under-River (also see below). Muzzlehatch decides it is not worth killing Cheeta's father, and he and his daughter flee. Titus also flees in an aircraft with Anchor and Juno. After flying for a while, Titus jumps out of the aircraft with a parachute and lands near a large rock that he knew from his childhood. Hearing the guns of Gormenghast saluting the missing Earl, he is confirmed in his knowledge that he is not insane and that the Castle exists. Tempted to return to his duties, he nevertheless confirms his desire for independence and once again strikes off alone, this time in a different direction. Other minor characters Helmeteers: Two soldiers or police officers who pursue Titus relentlessly throughout the book. They both wear uniforms and plumed helmets and carry scrolls of parchments in their hands. Not only do they look identical, but their every movement and posture is made simultaneously and in the same way. Crabcalf, Slingshott and Crack-Bell: Inhabitants of the Under-River region of tunnels and halls under the city's river, where refugees from various prison camps and persecutions gather to evade capture. Crabcalf is a failed author who lives surrounded by the unsold copies of his only published work, a book of poetry. Slingshott is a survivor of a saltmine. They leave the Under-River and go in search of Titus, after hearing of his fight with Veil. Veil: An ex- prison warden who lives in the Under-River region, with his companion the Black Rose. He is an evil and aggressive character who abuses the Black Rose. He fights Titus and is about to kill him, when he is in turn killed by Muzzlehatch. The Black Rose: An ex-inmate of some kind of prison camp, who lives in the Under-River region with Veil. She escaped from the camp by agreeing to become Veil's companion, but in exchange is forced to live as a different kind of prisoner, being abused and maltreated by Veil. The Scientist: Cheeta's father, who runs the mysterious and sinister factory. Despite being softly-spoken, grey and non-descript in appearance, the Scientist is some kind of evil genius who is conducting Frankenstein-like experiments in the factory, and appears to be leader of the scientists who control the city. Themes and motifs A main theme in the book is social exclusion, heralded by the title, again with the residents of Under River, and Titus himself. One possible theme is ancients versus moderns, a theme that has existed since the time of Swift. Titus only wants Cheeta because she is a modern girl surrounded by dazzling technology, and her father is an innovative scientist who runs a mass-production factory, and he has spent all his life in a moldy, antiquated castle run by tradition. But after having a long affair with Cheeta, he seems to realise she is self-centered and cruel, and rejects her. Cheeta becomes treacherous and vengeful and uses her technology and resources to hideously recreate Gormenghast, and she thinks nothing of it. Furthermore, even though her factory is efficient, sleek, and modern, there are indications that it may be an allegory for the Nazi concentration camps Peake encountered during his service in the Second World War. Further references to a police state and concentration camps are found in the back story of the Black Rose. The most the scientists manage to accomplish is to ruin Muzzlehatch's future by using a death ray to burn his zoo. As David Louis Edelman notes, the prescient Steerpike never seems to be able to accomplish much either, except to drive Titus' father mad by burning his library. The general theme, therefore, would seem to be that the false allure of the future is as dangerous and stupid as the false allure of the past. Critical reception The first edition contains many changes wrought by a heavy-handed editor, including the omission of entire chapters. The editor also removed various references to modern technology such as helicopters and cars. Critical reception has been more mixed since the complete novel was published.

Its southern terminus is at Pacific Coast Highway (SR 1), in Huntington Beach. SR 39's northern terminus is at Islip Saddle on Angeles Crest Highway (SR 2) in the Angeles National Forest, but its northernmost segment (including the connection with SR 2) has been closed to the public since 1978 due to a massive mud and rockslide. It would cost a total of $100 million USD to repair the road. Caltrans relinquished a portion of SR 39 in Buena Park from Stanton Avenue in Buena Park to Interstate 5 in 2013, as well as those segments within the cities of Azusa by 2010, Covina by 2010, and West Covina by 2013. Since 2001, a portion of SR 39 that runs through the city of Stanton has been considered for relinquishment to the city. If so, the portion that runs through the city of Anaheim will still be state controlled. Major places of interest along SR 39 are Knott's Berry Farm, an amusement park, Adventure City, another amusement park targeted for children, Huntington Beach, a local beach, a Medieval Times location, the Buena Park Auto Center, and the Westridge Golf Course in La Habra. Route description SR 39 closure in the San Gabriel Mountains Locked gate at northern terminus of Highway 39 Although defined to be a continuous route in the California Streets and Highway Code, there is a gap in the adopted State Route 39 maintained by Caltrans (see also the Future section below). The southern portion of State Route 39 runs along Beach Boulevard, with the exception of the segment between the southern city limit of Buena Park and Interstate 5, which was relinquished to the city in 2013. At Beach Boulevard's northerly terminus at Whittier Boulevard in La Habra, State Route 39 turns east to run to the intersection of Whittier Boulevard and Harbor Boulevard, taking over a former segment of Route 72, while the remaining segment Route 72 remains on Whittier Boulevard west of Beach Boulevard. An \\"END 39\\" sign then appears at the intersection of Whittier and Harbor, marking the northern terminus of the southern portion of the adopted Route 39. Adopted Route 39 then resumes and signs for Route 39 appear on Azusa Avenue from its junction with the San Bernardino Freeway (Interstate 10) in West Covina, and through Covina to First Street in the city of Azusa just north of Interstate 210. The route then runs as a couplet (composed of two one-way streets), with northbound traffic on Azusa Avenue, and southbound traffic on San Gabriel Avenue, to Sierra Madre Avenue where the two one-way streets converge to form San Gabriel Canyon Road. Although relinquished in the cities of West Covina, Covina, and Azusa, California Route 39 shields remain on this segment of the highway to aid motorists wishing to continue on Route 39. Map of the closed and incomplete section; the ca. 1967 reconstruction is shown in blue State maintenance of Route 39 begins again along San Gabriel Canyon Road at the north limit of Azusa. Route 39 winds through the San Gabriel Mountains in the Angeles National Forest for until it reaches a gate barring the road north of Crystal Lake Road in the Crystal Lake Recreation Area. The last six miles of the route, including the connection to Route 2, are closed to public highway traffic, as the roadbed has been closed since 1978, due to major rock slides that year and again in 2005 which damaged more of the remaining roadbed. Although Google Maps and other mapping services may list this section of the road as an \\"available\\" route to connect to Route 2, this section actually remains closed. A replacement of the section north of East Fork Road, in the next canyon to the east, was partly built in 1936 and 1961, but was never completed. The section includes one bridge and two tunnels; it was never used by automobile or truck traffic. In one local hiking guide the section is identified as the \\"Road to Nowhere\\" and the \\"Convict Road\\", although the official name is the Shoemaker Road and was planned to be an escape route in times of nuclear warfare. A ca. 1967 replacement, much closer to the existing alignment, was also stopped prematurely, and so the middle of the segment between East Fork Road and the closure gate, with its many hairpin curves, still exists. SR 39 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and the urban portions of SR 39 are part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 39 is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation. Future Although defined to be a continuous route, there is a break in adopted Route 39 at the intersection of Whittier Boulevard with Harbor Boulevard, where an \\"END 39\\" sign appears. Since 1992, when the Harbor Boulevard extension opened, the California Streets and Highways Code has defined the continuation of Route 39 as \\"via Harbor Boulevard to the vicinity of Fullerton Road, then to Azusa Avenue\\" through Rowland Heights. After the overlap on Beach Boulevard, Route 39 used to turn north on Hacienda Road to the junction with the I-10 and followed for a mile before separating on Azusa Avenue, but that portion has since been relinquished to Los Angeles County and Route 39 was relocated to end on Harbor Boulevard. The traversable route to fill the Route 39 gap would be via Harbor Boulevard north, Fullerton Road north, and then Colima Road west to Azusa Avenue in Hacienda Heights. Route 39 would then continue north on Azusa Avenue through the City of Industry to Interstate 10 in West Covina. History Prior to the present before reaching Harbor Boulevard, SR 39 continued north from Whittier Boulevard along Hacienda Road to the Los Angeles/Orange County line then north on Hacienda Boulevard and Glendora Avenue to US 60, 70, and 99 (Garvey Avenue, now Interstate 10) in West Covina. It then continued east with US 60, 70, and 99 to Azusa Avenue where it turned north to follow the present alignment as described beginning in the fourth paragraph of the preceding section. The Hacienda Glendora segment can still be seen as Route 39 on some maps. Prior to 1991, Harbor Boulevard would become Fullerton Road heading northward at the Los Angeles/Orange County Line, and would continue north as Fullerton Road though the Puente Hills as a one-lane winding road into Rowland Heights. However, due to complaints of nearby residents due to the increased volume of traffic, a straighter, wider stub was built slightly to the east, and was named Harbor Boulevard. This route is in consideration to become part of SR 39 to complete the gap. The new Harbor Boulevard became opened to the public early in 1992 and now serves as the primary passage between Orange County and Rowland Heights. The original winding Fullerton Road segment still exists but no longer serves as the primary passage. It is now strictly a residential street. On July 10, 2006, the Pasadena Star-News reported that the state provided funding for an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) in June 2006 to assess the feasibility of reopening Highway 39 in the Angeles National Forest. A stretch of the road, from Snow Springs north of Azusa to Highway 2, has been closed to the public since 1978 due to a massive mud and rockslide. While the road is passable to emergency vehicles for the entire closed length, sections near reoccurring rock slides become narrow dirt roads which are not suitable for passenger vehicles. The EIR will take three years to complete, according to California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) officials. The highway was opened to emergency crews in February 2003 after a Caltrans study showed reopening it would not harm wetlands, air and water quality, natural vegetation or threatened plants and animals. According to the Caltrans District Seven \\"Inside Seven\\" newsletter, work was to continue through 2009 and 2010 on reconstruction and installation of features to prevent future slides from damaging the roadway: \\"Two projects that will address those issues and get the highway reopened are scheduled for construction soon. The first, building two retaining walls near the city of Azusa from Old San Gabriel Canyon Road to approximately four miles south of SR-2, could begin in mid-2009. The second, a $45 million project to reconstruct the roadway, construct soldier pile retaining walls, repair drainage systems, install rock fall protection, and provide asphalt concrete overlay and traffic striping, should begin in fall 2010.\\"(source) However, due to budgetary issues, by 2012 Caltrans was instead trying to transfer responsibility for the entirety of SR 39 north of postmile LA 17.81 (including the closed section) to either the U.S. Forest Service or Los Angeles County, both of which declined, also for financial reasons, even though both the USFS and the county deem the route \\"essential\\". Abandoning the route would also not be cost-effective for Caltrans due, among other reasons, to federal environmental restoration requirements related to the presence of bighorn sheep. The proposal was abandoned after opposition by local residents and the county, as well as substantial legal pressure by the Forest Service, who threatened to enforce an old contract that requires Caltrans to completely deconstruct the highway should it refuse to maintain it. There are proposals to move the closed gate north two miles to a popular trailhead. People heading to Mount Waterman must currently travel west to Pasadena and join the Angeles Crest Highway (Highway 2) in La Ca√±ada Flintridge - a nearly two-hour trip. Reopening Highway 39 would cut the drive-time to the Waterman ski area in half and shorten the trip east to Wrightwood.

The most frequent reason for extinction is the marginalisation of local languages within a wider dominant nation state, which might at times amount to outright political oppression. This process normally works alongside economic and cultural pressures for greater centralisation and assimilation. Once a language has become marginalised in this way, it is often perceived as being \\"useless\\" by its remaining speakers, who associate it with low social status and poverty, and consequently fail to pass it on to the next generation. The only substantial success story in the field of language revival is Hebrew; all other cases are projects of limited success.

As of 2009, many students were able to carry on conversations in Chochenyo. Cornish The opening verses of Origo Mundi, the first play of the Ordinalia (the magnum opus of medieval Cornish literature), written by an unknown monk in the late 14th century Cornish was once spoken in the Duchy of Cornwall until it became extinct as a spoken language in the late 18th century. The language had been in decline since the 14th century and by the time of the death of the last fluent speakers, was only spoken in the western fringes of the county. Dolly Pentreath (d. 1777) is believed to have been the last speaker of the language. Literature from the Medieval and Tudor periods, and fragments, including grammars, from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries survived, which allowed Cornish to be reconstructed by a small group of Celtic enthusiasts in the 20th century as part of the Celtic Revival. These Cornish language revivalists borrowed heavily from Welsh and Breton in order to aid in the creation of the modern Cornish language. The reconstruction of the language was known for disputes over orthography during the late 20th century, until a Standard Written Form was agreed upon in 2008. The number of Cornish speakers is difficult to estimate, but it is believed that some 500 individuals have a degree of fluency in the language. The language is now taught in some schools in Cornwall. UNESCO recently reclassified the language from \\"extinct\\" to \\"critically endangered\\". Dalmatian The Dalmatian language was spoken in Dalmatia, a coastal region of Croatia, in the Middle Ages. Its last known native speaker was Antonio Tuone Udaina, who died on June 10, 1898, as the result of an explosion. The Dalmatian language is being revived by pro-autonomist Dalmatian activists, and today is estimated that there are about 20 fluent Dalmatian speakers and more than one hundred people with some knowledge of the language. Diyari Diyari is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken in the far north of South Australia, to the east of Kati Thanda (Lake Eyre). Studies and translations by German Lutheran missionaries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries created an extensive written form. By the early 21st century, only a few fluent speakers of Diyari remained. However, by 2013 Peter K. Austin had produced a dictionary and grammar of the language, and as of 2019, there is a project under way to teach it in schools. Hawaiian On six of the seven inhabited islands of Hawaii, Hawaiian was displaced by English and is no longer used as the daily language of communication. The one exception is Ni ªihau, where Hawaiian has never been displaced, has never been endangered, and is still used almost exclusively. Native speakers of Ni ªihau Hawaiian speak among themselves in a way significantly different from the Hawaiian of the other islands--so different that it can be difficult for non-Ni ªihau speakers of Hawaiian to understand. The most marked difference between Niiahauan and Hawaiian is that the Hawaiian K sound is often replaced with a T sound in Niihauan. Efforts to revive the language have increased in recent decades. Hawaiian language immersion schools are now open to children whose families want to retain (or introduce) Hawaiian language into the next generation. The local NPR station features a short segment titled \\"Hawaiian word of the day\\". Additionally, the Sunday editions of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin feature a brief article called Kauakukalahale, written entirely in Hawaiian by a student. Hebrew First Hebrew school in Rishon Lezion Hebrew was revived as a spoken language two millennia after it ceased to be spoken (although it was always used as a written language), and is considered a language revival \\"success story\\". Although used in liturgy, and to a limited extent commerce, it was extinct as a language used in everyday life until its revival, considered impractically archaic or too sacred for day-to-day communication, although it was, in fact, used as an international language between Jews who had no other common tongue, with several Hebrew-medium newspapers in circulation around Europe at the beginning of the 19th century, and a number of Zionist conferences being conducted exclusively in Hebrew. Starting in the late 19th century, it was revived as an everyday spoken language as part of the emerging Zionist movement. Eliezer Ben-Yehuda largely spearheaded the revival efforts, and his son Itamar Ben-Avi was raised as the first native Hebrew speaker since Hebrew's extinction as an everyday language. Hebrew is now the primary official language of Israel, and the most commonly spoken language there. It is spoken by over 9,000,000 people today. Most of them live in Israel or are Israeli expatriates, but many in Jewish communities outside Israel have undertaken its study. Kaurna Kaurna is an Australian Aboriginal language of the Kaurna people in Adelaide, South Australia, Australia. It is currently being revived by the Kaurna Warra Pintyandi, a committee of Kaurna Elders and youth, teachers, linguists and other researchers based at the University of Adelaide. Latin ATM. Latin was historically the language of the Roman Empire, but spread through Europe and beyond, thanks partially to its role in the Roman Catholic Church and in higher register. Feature films and broadcasting have been conducted in Latin. Two notable examples include 1976's Sebastiane by Derek Jarman and Paul Humfress, and Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ (which also contains long sections in Aramaic). Harry Potter has even been translated into Latin and ancient Greek. Lazuri (Laz) The UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger (2010) declares Lazuri as a language that is definitively endangered. Lazuri is a Southwest Caucasian language spoken by ca. 30,000 people as their mother tongue along the East Black Sea coast of Turkey and in some parts of the Autonomous Republic of Adjara (Salminen, 2007). The region where the Lazi people live is called Lazona (Benninghaus, 1989). Because Lazuri is primarily an oral language, and all new speakers tend to grow up bilingual (typically speaking Lazuri and Turkish), the language is at risk of extinction (e.g., Yuksel-Sokmen & Chasin, 2008). Although the Lazuri alphabet was first established around the late 20s by a native folklorist, named Iskender Tsitasi, who published periodicals and poems until 1938, there were many obstacles to learn and to teach Lazuri due to the lack of language learning resources and limited documentation of the language (interview with language activist ƒ∞smail Avcƒ± Bucakli≈üi in Istanbul, April 2012). Hence, Lazuri remained a primary spoken language until Lazoglu and Feuerstein re-introduced the Lazuri Alboni or Alphabet in Latin letters in 1984 and started to publish periodicals, called 'Ogni' (\\"Did you hear\\"). The first Lazuri Dictionary (Bucakli≈üi & Uzunhasanoƒülu, 2006) was among the first one to adopt the Lazuri Alboni. The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupery become the first book which has been formally translated into the Lazuri Alboni by Sinan Albayrakoƒülu (2011) who worked four years on the Turkish to Lazuri translation. Also, in 2011 the Bosphorus University of Istanbul started to offer Lazuri as an elective class for beginners. With the recent establishment of the Lazika Yayin Kolektif (Lazika Publication Collective) in 2010, current and future generations of students, teachers, authors, and scholars of Lazuri are encouraged to contribute to the process of language revitalization, thus paving the way for a Lazuri literature. Livonian Livonian is a Finnic language spoken in Latvia. It is one of the three languages (along with Manx and Cornish) listed as revived by the UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger.UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger Leonese Leonese was recognised as a seriously endangered language by UNESCO, in 2006. The only legal reference to this language is in the Autonomy Statute of Castile and Le√≥n. The Province of Le√≥n government supports the knowledge of this language through courses, by celebrating \\"Leonese Language Day\\" and by sponsoring literary efforts in the Leonese language, such as \\"Cuentos del Sil\\", where nine writers from teenagers to people in their eighties develop several stories in Leonese. The Leonese Local Government uses the Leonese language in some of their bureaus, organizes courses for adults and in 2007 organized Leonese Language Day. The Leonese Local Government official website uses the Leonese language. The Leonese language is taught in two schools of Le√≥n city since February 2008. The local authority for education said it would be taught in all Leonese schools next course. Manx Use of Manx on the national museum; note the smaller font size of the Manx. Manx is a language spoken in the Isle of Man, which is in the Irish Sea, between Scotland, England, Ireland and Wales. Manx ceased to function as a community language during the first quarter of the 20th century, but was revived by enthusiasts at a time when there were still a number of native speakers alive. Although at one point no native speakers of the language were alive and it may have been officially classified as \\"dead\\" in 1975, the revival appears to have gained strength in recent years. There is a regular programme in Manx on Manx Radio. As of 2012 there were sixty-nine pupils undergoing their education through the medium of Manx at the . MƒÅori MƒÅori is the indigenous language of New Zealand, where it was commonly spoken until the 20th century. In recent times initiatives have been taken to revitalize MƒÅori as a spoken language. Mutsun Mutsun is one of the eight Ohlone languages originally spoken in the San Juan Bautista, California area. The last fluent speaker, Ascencion Sol√≥rzano de Cervantes, died 1930. The contemporary tribe, Amah Mutsun Tribal Band, is working to revive the language using the notes of linguist John Peabody Harrington. The Mutsun language has a program to teach it to tribal members and a dictionary is being planned. The initial member to galvanize the language revitalization is Quirina Geary. Immersion into the language is planned in books, songs, and games Rumsen and Chochenyo are the other two Costanoan languages being revived along with Mutsun. Occitan Gascon Aranese signage in Boss√≤st, Val d'Aran The Aranese language, a standardized form of the Pyrenean Gascon variety of the Occitan language spoken in the Aran Valley, in northwestern Catalonia is still spoken. Once considered to be an endangered language, spoken mainly by older people, it is now experiencing a renaissance; it enjoys co-official status with Catalan and Castilian (Spanish) in Catalonia, and since 1984 has been taught in schools. Old Prussian Old Prussian is a revitalized language, originally went extinct by the early 18th century, an attempted revival of Old Prussian has been made on the uncertain time, first revitalization on 1989 as Revived Old Prussian or \\"Neo\\"-Prussian. Palawa kani Palawa kani is an attempt to revive various Tasmanian dialects in a single combined form. The original Tasmanian languages, which may have numbered a dozen or more, became extinct in 1905 when the last native speaker died. As part of community efforts to retrieve as much of the original Tasmanian culture as possible, efforts are made to (re)construct a language for the indigenous community. Due to the scarcity of records, Palawa kani is being constructed as a composite of the estimated 6 to 12 original languages. Theresa Sainty and Jenny Longey were the first two \\"language workers\\" to work on the project in 1999. Sanskrit A revived language being put to another use: the Agni and Prithvi missiles of India. Sanskrit was a pan-Indian language in Vedic times but lost its prominent place among spoken dialects in modern India. A number of attempts to revive Sanskrit have been made from the 18th century onward. However, it has been challenged in this role by various community languages, Hindi, Urdu and English. Many of India's and Nepal's scientific and administrative terms are named in Sanskrit, as a counterpart of the western practice of naming scientific developments in Latin or Classical Greek. The Indian guided missile program that was commenced in 1983 by DRDO has named the five missiles (ballistic and others) that it has developed as Prithvi, Agni, Akash, Nag and Trishul. India's first modern fighter aircraft is named HAL Tejas. Modern Sanskrit is spoken in around four villages in India. The Mattur village in central Karnataka, Shimoga district claims to have native speakers of Sanskrit among its population. Historically the village was given by King Krishnadevaraya of the Vijayanagara Empire to Vedic scholars and their families. People in his kingdom spoke Kannada and Telugu.This village speaks gods language 13 Aug 2005 Times of India Retrieved on September 14, 2008 Samskrita Bharati (, ) is a non-profit organization working to revive Sanskrit, also termed Sanskrit revival.

The character is usually depicted as an adversary of Captain Britain and the X-Men. The character was created by writer Alan Moore and artist Alan Davis, and first appeared in Marvel Super- Heroes #387 (July 1982). Fictional character biography The Fury is a deadly \\"cybiote\\" built by the reality-manipulating psychic Mad Jim Jaspers of the parallel timeline of Earth-238 and programmed to destroy all superhumans but himself. It is immensely powerful, capable of generating lethal energy blasts and of adapting and regenerating its mechanical body. Like most of Jim Jaspers' other homicidal agents, the Fury was named for a minor character in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland: The Fury slew all of Earth-238's superheroes, with the exception of Captain UK, who fled to another world at the moment that the Fury killed her husband Rick. Most of the Fury's victims on Earth-238 were based on British comic book characters from the 1950s-1970s. After succeeding in its mission, the Fury was deactivated until Captain Britain and his elflike sidekick Jackdaw were sent to Earth-238 by the Captain's mythic mentor Merlyn. Jaspers had his agents, the Status Crew, reactivate the Fury and send it to kill the hero. The Fury murdered Jackdaw, and then killed Captain Britain himself.Marvel Super-Heroes #387 The Captain was retrieved by Merlyn and revived in the alien magician's home dimension, Otherworld. The Fury detected that its prey again lived, and began to adapt itself to interdimensional travel in order to hunt him down. Meanwhile, the temporal overseer Mandragon destroyed Earth-238 in order to kill Jaspers; the Fury barely escaped to Captain Britain's native world, Earth-616. There, the Fury killed several more of Captain Britain's allies, growing ever more powerful as it did so. Tracking Captain Britain and disabling him, it finally confronted Earth-616's counterpart of Mad Jim Jaspers, who was beginning to organize a program against his own world's superhumans. The Fury determined that this Jaspers was not its creator and therefore was not exempt from its directive to kill superhumans. The two fought on equal footing, but the Fury won when it transported the pair to the empty void that had been Earth-238. Jaspers was unable to use his powers of reality manipulation in a universe where reality had been destroyed, and the Fury swiftly incinerated his brain. The weakened Fury returned to Earth-616, where it was ambushed and destroyed by Captain Britain and Captain UK, sustaining more damage in the process than it could regenerate. The Fury preyed on Captain Britain's mind and thus was used by the insane Orpington-Smythe, leader of the R.C.X.. He had one of his super-powered agents cast an illusion of Captain Britain's lover Meggan, making her look like the Fury. The Captain instantly struck her down, though she survives with minor injuries. The Fury reappeared years later in several issues of Uncanny X-MenUncanny X-Men #444-447. Marvel Comics that were written by Captain Britain co-creator Chris Claremont and illustrated by Fury co- creator Alan Davis. The Fury, which was later revealed to be a facsimile created by Captain Britain's brother Jamie Braddock, destroys Captain Britain's home and beat the visiting X-Men unconscious. It takes control of X-Men member Sage, who possesses a \\"computer brain\\", and has her attack her teammates, but its control over her is severed by an electrical field created by Storm. The Fury is again destroyed when Rachel Summers creates an artificial black hole inside its body, collapsing it into a singularity. In Uncanny X-Men #462, Mad Jim Jaspers is resurrected in Otherworld and appears to have merged with the Fury. This leads into the miniseries X-Men: Die by the Sword, in which Jaspers begins transforming the Captain Britain Corps members into Fury. This results in most of the Corps being slain. In the conclusion of this series Fury takes complete control of Jaspers before being defeated and destroyed.X-Men: Die by the Sword #5 (2008) A small remnant of Fury is shown binding with an unknowing Merlyn. He later discovered it, extracted it, and used it as part of a spell to resurrect a fallen Captain Britain.Captain Britain and MI: 13 #3. Marvel Comics Powers and abilities The Fury is described as \\"the supreme killing machine\\", and was created via a combination of reality warping and technology, granting it the ability to adapt to anything and everything without limit, making it near-invincible. Its left arm fires energy blasts that are potent enough to kill literally every superhero in its original reality. The Fury can also fire poisonous, barbed darts. The Fury carries detailed files on all known superhumans, and its sophisticated array of sensors is powerful enough to recognize when it has killed all superhumans present in the universe. It has a back-up brain in its spine, should its main brain be disabled. The Fury has superhuman physical abilities and is virtually indestructible. If damaged, it has self-repair systems, and is capable of developing new powers to deal with unexpected situations. The Fury develops limited teleportation abilities, and when it continues to track the resurrected Captain Britain across realities, it acquires the ability to cross dimensions. Trans-dimensional travel nearly destroys the Fury, and it usually needs to acquire raw \\"genetic material\\" to rebuild itself. It is most vulnerable to being destroyed at this time, as its strength, invulnerability and energy blasts are compromised. The Fury can kill regular humans and use their bodies for this purpose, although killing non-superhumans appears to not be a primary function of the Fury. The Fury's dart weapons are tipped with a powerful sedative and mutagenic. The Fury kills a host body with its attached barb and drags the body closer to itself. Sid, a hapless drifter, managed to escape the Fury shortly after it warped to Captain Britain's dimension, but he was grazed by one of the Fury's darts. The powerful toxin turns him into a monster that terrorizes London until Captain Britain and the British Army kill him.The Daredevils #4, April 1983 The Fury can use any other resources around to rebuild and improve itself. It absorbs most of the 'Mastermind' computer at Braddock Manor, giving it vastly improved computational abilities. Other versions Spectacular Spider-Man Adventures, a monthly comic based on the 1990s Spider-Man cartoon and published by Panini Comics in the UK, featured the Fury in #133 (April 2006).Fury Returns , Down The Tubes, January 26, 2006 The creature emerged in Scotland and battles both Captain Britain & Spider- Man; Captain Britain eventually sacrificed himself to stop it by trapping them both in another reality. In 2009, Marvel Heroes #15-16 featured the return of the Fury. In #15, Captain Britain returned to Earth with a warning that the Fury was coming back: repeated simulations by a Panini equivalent of the Illuminati ran hundreds of combat simulations, finding that in each one the Fury would slaughter them. The Silver Surfer offered a solution: making a deal with Galactus to gain the reality-altering Ultimate Nullifier. In #16, the Surfer and Captain Britain successfully gained the weapon, as even Galactus himself won't stand a chance against the Fury. Back on Earth, the cybiote made its appearance in Scotland and began heading south. The next five pages saw the Fury slaughtering every super-team that attempted to stop it: MI-13's British heroes at Dumfries, the X-Men at Manchester, the Avengers and Hulk at Birmingham, the New Warriors, the Defenders, Alpha Flight at Northampton, and a supervillain army at a motorway (the last panel of this had Doctor Doom announcing \\"Enough! I am Doom, and will destroy-\\" before he was shot in the face). Finally, the Fantastic Four and their allies fought the monster in central London and were wiped out. At this, the last few heroes and the survivors of the previous battles united under the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier for a last stand. However, Captain Britain and the Silver Surfer arrived in time, and Captain Britain (with the magical and psychic support of every other hero) fired the Nullifier at close range. The Fury was erased from existence, and reality was reset: all those killed lived again, and there was no memory of the Fury's rampage except for the Watcher's.

It was to have been the fourth novel in the Gormenghast series, after Titus Groan, Gormenghast, and Titus Alone. Titus Awakes remains unfinished, as the author succumbed to illness before the work could be completed. In the 1970s Peake's widow, Maeve Gilmore, wrote a version of Titus Awakes to which she gave the title Search Without End. It runs to 65,000 words, as counted on the typescript that she asked Peter Winnington to comment on. Watney told a slightly different tale. In 1992 Overlook Press, the American publishers of the Gormenghast series, printed at the end of Titus Alone the existing coherent portions of Mervyn Peake's Titus Awakes, with a brief introduction by John Watney. They consist of three pages from which it is clear that, although Titus has left Gormenghast, the castle remains active in his memory and important in the story. Although Peake wrote further passages, the editors were unable to decipher them. Critical reception This unfinished work is not well-known even among readers of Peake's other works, having been published only in the Overlook editions (albeit in both single volume and omnibus). Mills (2005) comments on the irony of the narrator's comment that Titus would never again see Gormenghast Castle, for \\"even in the first proposed chapter, Titus returns in a dream to Gormenghast and the fight between Swelter and Flay.\\" The textual repetition in the preadventure was commented upon by Chris Sandow, who stated that \\"[t]he fragments are clearly no more than early drafts\\". However, it is not clear that the repetition is an error. Continued manuscript Early in 2010 Sebastian Peake announced that his daughter had found Maeve Gilmore's notebook MS of Titus Awakes in the family's attic. It follows Titus's journeyings in the wider world and his arrival at an island that Peake identifies as Sark, where the Peake family lived from 1946 to 1949. Finally, Titus becomes Mervyn Peake. The book was published by Overlook Press as Titus Awakes: The Lost Book of Gormenghast in June 2011 to coincide with the 100th anniversary of Mervyn Peake's birth.

Its mission was to intercept, decrypt, and analyze naval communications from Japanese, German, and Italian navies. In addition OP-20-G also copied diplomatic messages of many foreign governments. The majority of the sections effort was directed towards Japan and included breaking the early Japanese \\"Blue\\" book fleet code. This was made possible by intercept and High Frequency Direction Finder (HFDF) sites in the Pacific, Atlantic, and continental U.S., as well as a Japanese telegraphic code school for radio operators in Washington, D.C. History The Code and Signal Section was formally made a part of the Division of Naval Communications (DNC), as Op-20-G, on July 1, 1922. In January 1924, a 34-year-old U.S. Navy lieutenant named Laurance F. Safford was assigned to expand OP-20-G's domain to radio interception. He worked out of Room 2646, on the top floor of the Navy Department building in Washington, D.C.. Japan was of course a prime target for radio interception and cryptanalysis, but there was the problem of finding personnel who could speak Japanese. The Navy had a number of officers who had served in a diplomatic capacity in Japan and could speak Japanese fluently, but there was a shortage of radiotelegraph operators who could read Japanese Wabun code communications sent in kana. Fortunately, a number of US Navy and Marine radiotelegraph operators operating in the Pacific had formed an informal group in 1923 to compare notes on Japanese kana transmissions. Four of these men became instructors in the art of reading kana transmissions when the Navy began conducting classes in the subject in 1928. The classes were conducted by the Room 2426 crew, and the radiotelegraph operators became known as the \\"On- The-Roof Gang\\". By June 1940, OP-20-G included 147 officers, enlisted men, and civilians, linked into a network of radio listening posts as far-flung as the Army's. OP-20-G did some work on Japanese diplomatic codes, but the organization's primary focus was on Japanese military codes. The US Navy first got a handle on Japanese naval codes in 1922, when Navy agents broke into the Japanese consulate in New York City, cracked the safe, took photographs of pages of a Japanese navy codebook, and left, having put everything back as they had found it. Before the war, the Navy cipher bureau operated out of three main bases: *Station NEGAT at headquarters in Washington, D.C. * Station HYPO (or FRUPAC), a section at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii * Station CAST, a section in the fortified caves of the island of Corregidor, in the Philippines, with codebreakers and a network of listening and radio direction finding stations. * FRUMEL was established in Melbourne when Navy signals intelligence personnel from the Philippines were evacuated to Australia. Evacuated Army signals intelligence personnel went to the Central Bureau. The US Army Signal Intelligence Service (SIS) and OP-20-G were hobbled by bureaucracy and rivalry, competing with each other to provide their intelligence data, codenamed \\"MAGIC\\", to high officials. Complicating matters was that the Coast Guard, the FBI, and even the FCC also had radio-intercept operations. The Navy organisation at OP-20-G was more conventionally hierarchical than the Army at Arlington Hall which went more on merit rather than rank (like Bletchley Park), though commissions were handed out to \\"civilians in uniform\\" with rank according to age (an ensign for 28 or under, a lieutenant to 35 or a lieutenant commander if over 35). But control was by \\"regular military types\\". The Navy wanted the Army to forbid civilians to touch the SIGABA cipher machine like the Navy; though it was developed by a civilian (William Friedman). A Royal Navy visitor and intercept specialist Commander Sandwith reported in 1942 on \\"the dislike of Jews prevalent in the US Navy (while) nearly all the leading Army cryptographers are Jews\\". So in 1940, SIS and OP-20-G came to agreement with guide lines for handling MAGIC; the Army was responsible on even-numbered days and the Navy on odd-numbered days. So on the first minute after midnight on 6 December 1941 the Navy took over. But USN Lt-Comdr Alwin Kramer had no relief officer (unlike the Army, with Dusenbury and Bratton); and that night was being driven around by his wife. He was also responsible for distributing MAGIC information to the President; in January 1941 the Army agreed that they would supply the White House in January, March, May, July, September and November and the Navy in February, April, June, August, October and December. But in May 1941 MAGIC documents were found in the desk of Roosevelt's military aide Edwin \\"Pa\\" Watson and the Navy took over; while the Army provided MAGIC to the State Department instead. The result was that much of the MAGIC was delayed or unused. There was no efficient process for assessing and organizing the intelligence, as was provided postwar by a single intelligence agency. Attack on Pearl Harbor In the early hours of the morning of 7 December 1941, the U.S. Navy communications intercept station at Fort Ward on Bainbridge Island, Washington, picked up a radio message being sent by the Japanese government to the Japanese embassy in Washington, D.C. It was the last in a series of 14 messages that had been sent over the previous 18 hours. The messages were decrypted by a PURPLE analogue machine at OP-20-G and passed to the SIS for translation from Japanese, early on the morning of December 7. Army Colonel Rufus S. Bratton and Navy Lieutenant Commander Alwin Kramer independently inspected the decrypts. The decrypts instructed the Japanese ambassador to Washington to inform the US Secretary of State, Cordell Hull, at 1:00 PM Washington time that negotiations between the United States and Japan were ended. The embassy was then to destroy their cipher machines. This sounded like war, and although the message said nothing about any specific military action, Kramer also realized that the sun would be rising over the expanses of the central and western Pacific by that time. The two men both tried to get in touch with Army Chief of Staff General George C. Marshall. After some agonizing delays, Marshall got the decrypts and methodically examined them. He realized their importance and sent a warning to field commanders, including Major General Walter Short, the Army commander in Hawaii. However, Marshall was reluctant to use the telephone because he knew that telephone scramblers weren't very secure and sent it by less direct channels. Due to various constraints and bumblings, Short got the message many hours after the Japanese bombs had smashed the US Navy's fleet at anchor in Pearl Harbor. After Pearl Harbor In February 1942 power struggles within the Navy resulted in the sidelining of Laurance Safford, with the support of Admirals Ernest King and Richmond K. Turner (and Joseph Redman) for the centralizing of control of naval intercept and codebreaking in Washington. So two new sections were headed by John R. Redman (Communications Combat Intelligence section) and Joseph Wenger (Communications Cryptanalytical section; to handle decryption and translation). Safford was shifted to an administrative support and cryptographic research role; so was sidelined for the remainder of the war, as ultimately was Joseph Rochefort in Hawaii. As Japanese advances in the Philippines, the possibility of an invasion of Hawaii, and the increasing demand for intelligence, OP-20-G undertook two courses of action: * The staff and services of CAST were progressively transferred to a newly formed US-Australian-British station, FRUMEL in Melbourne, Australia.Parker, Frederick D. A Priceless Advantage: U.S. Navy Communications Intelligence and the Battles of Coral Sea, Midway, and the Aleutians. Fort Meade MD: Center for Cryptologic History, National Security Agency, 1993. * Another signals intelligence center, known as NEGAT was formed in Washington, using elements of OP-20-G headquarters. = Naval Communications Annex = In Summer 1942 the Navy went through the motions of perhaps co-locating with the Army's SIS but Commander Joseph Wenger had picked out the \\"perfect new home\\" for the rapidly expanding OP-20-G and acquired a private girls' school Mount Vernon College for Women for $800,000 (a fraction of what the buildings and grounds were worth). So on 7 February 1943 it opened at what was called the \\"Naval Communications Annex\\", and staff moved in over the next two months.

Stereotypies may be simple movements such as body rocking, or complex, such as self-caressing, crossing and uncrossing of legs, and marching in place. They are found in people with intellectual disabilities, autism spectrum disorders, tardive dyskinesia and stereotypic movement disorder, but may also be encountered in neurotypical individuals as well. Studies have shown stereotypies associated with some types of schizophrenia. Frontotemporal dementia is also a common neurological cause of repetitive behaviors and stereotypies. Several causes have been hypothesized for stereotypy, and several treatment options are available. Stereotypy is sometimes called stimming in autism, under the hypothesis that it self-stimulates one or more senses. Among people with frontotemporal lobar degeneration, more than half (60%) had stereotypies. The time to onset of stereotypies in people with frontotemporal lobar degeneration may be years (average 2.1 years). Distinction from tics Like tics, stereotypies are patterned and periodic, and are made worse by fatigue, stress, and anxiety. Unlike tics, stereotypies usually begin before the age of three, involve more of the body, are more rhythmic and less random, and are associated more with engrossment in another activity rather than premonitory urges. Examples of early tics are things like blinking and throat clearing, while arm flapping is a more common stereotypy. Stereotypies do not have the ever-changing, waxing and waning nature of tics, and can remain constant for years. Tics are usually suppressible for brief periods; in contrast, children rarely consciously attempt to control a stereotypy, although they can be distracted from one. Proposed causes There are several possible explanations for stereotypy, and different stereotyped behaviors may have different explanations. A popular explanation is stimming, which hypothesizes that a particular stereotyped behavior has a function related to sensory input. Other explanations include hypotheses that stereotypy discharges tension or expresses frustration, that it communicates a need for attention or reinforcement or sensory stimulation, that it is learned or neuropathological or some combination of the two, or that it is normal behavior with no particular explanation needed. Associated terms Punding is a term that was coined originally to describe complex prolonged, purposeless, and stereotyped behavior in chronic amphetamine users; it was later described in Parkinson's disease. Punding is a compulsion to perform repetitive mechanical tasks, such as sorting, collecting, or assembling and disassembling common items. Punding may occur in individuals with Parkinson's disease treated with dopaminergic agents such as L-DOPA. Tweaking is a slang term for compulsive or repetitive behavior; it refers to someone exhibiting pronounced symptoms of methamphetamine or amphetamine use. Reprinted with permission from the NDIC Narcotics Digest Weekly 2005;4(2):1 In animals Stereotypies also occur in non-human animals. It is considered an abnormal behavior and is sometimes seen in captive animals, particularly those held in small enclosures with little opportunity to engage in more normal behaviors. These behaviors may be maladaptive, involving self-injury or reduced reproductive success, and in laboratory animals can confound behavioral research. Examples of stereotypical behaviors include pacing, rocking, swimming in circles, excessive sleeping, self-mutilation (including feather picking and excessive grooming), and mouthing cage bars. Stereotypies are seen in many species, including primates, birds, and carnivores. Up to 40% of elephants in zoos display stereotypical behaviors. Stereotypies are well known in stabled horses, usually developing as a result of being confined, particularly with insufficient exercise. They are colloquially called stable vices. They present a management issue, not only leading to facility damage from chewing, kicking, and repetitive motion, but also lead to health consequences for the animal if not addressed. Stereotypical behaviors are thought to be caused ultimately by artificial environments that do not allow animals to satisfy their normal behavioral needs. Rather than refer to the behavior as abnormal, it has been suggested that it be described as \\"behavior indicative of an abnormal environment.\\" Stereotypies are correlated with altered behavioral response selection in the basal ganglia. As stereotypies are frequently viewed as a sign of psychological distress in animals, there is also an animal welfare issue involved. Stereotypical behavior can sometimes be reduced or eliminated by environmental enrichment, including larger and more stimulating enclosures, training, and introductions of stimuli (such as objects, sounds, or scents) to the animal's environment. The enrichment must be varied to remain effective for any length of time. Housing social animals with other members of their species is also helpful. But once the behavior is established, it is sometimes impossible to eliminate due to alterations in the brain. References External links * Chinthapalli V. M.; Singer H. S.

First identified in 1923, it inhabits moss that grows on rocks underneath the forest canopy. Description M. montivaga is one of the smallest mygalomorph spiders, with adults only measuring 3 to 4 mm (about 1/8 inch). The coloration varies from light brown to yellow-brown to a darker reddish brown, with no markings on the abdomen. The chelicerae project forward, and one pair of spinnerets is very long. It possesses a second pair of book lungs, which appear as light patches behind the genital furrow. Biology M. montivaga constructs tube-shaped webs, apparently for shelter, as prey has never been found in them. It probably feeds on springtails that are abundant in moss mats. M. montivaga can take as long as three years to reach maturity, due to low temperatures and resulting slow metabolism. Endangered status The widespread death of Fraser fir trees has destroyed many habitats for M. montivaga, and the spider species was listed as endangered in 1995. Many Fraser firs have died due to infestation with Adelges piceae, the balsam woolly adelgid, an insect pest introduced from Europe. The resulting thinning of the forest canopy leads to the drying of the moss mats that are essential for the spider's survival, as it requires climates of high and constant humidity. These spiders have survived in temperatures that range between -17.8 ¬∞C or 0 ¬∞F and 19.8 ¬∞C or 67.6 ¬∞F within mountainous regions of the Southern Appalachians. Distribution M. multivaga is known from Fraser fir and red spruce forests on mountain peaks at and above in the Southern Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina and Tennessee. It has been recorded from Clingmans Dome and Mount Collins (both very small populations), Mount Le Conte, Mount Mitchell (probably extirpated), Grandfather Mountain, and Roan Mountain. The Tennessee population, located in Sevier County, was considered healthy up to 1989, but is now possibly extirpated. On two locations in North Carolina, there was only one spider found each in recent years. Only the population along the Avery/Caldwell County line in North Carolina seems to be relatively stable. This population appears to be restricted to the moss mats on a single rock outcrop and a few surrounding boulders.

Originally established as VF-17 on 1 January 1943, it was redesignated as VF-5B on 15 November 1946, redesignated as VF-61 on 28 July 1948 it was disestablished on 15 April 1959. It was the first navy squadron to be designated VF-17. Operational history =World War II= VF-17 was established on 1 January 1943, at NAS Norfolk, with Lieutenant Commander John T. \\"Tommy\\" Blackburn as its commander. It was the second Navy fighter squadron to receive the F4U-1 Corsair and the most successful of them all. Blackburn wanted a squadron insignia that had a piratical theme to it to match the F4U's Corsair designation; hence the skull and crossbones were chosen. The original design was developed by Harry Hollmeyer who became an ace pilot. The squadron helped during the development of the F4U Corsair resulting in some design changes, resulting in the F4U-1A. Unfortunately, the Navy still deemed the Corsair unfit for carrier service and instead of joining , VF-17 became a land-based squadron in the Solomon Islands during most of its deployment to the South Pacific. On 8 November 1943, the squadron executive officer, Roger Hedrick, led a flight which intercepted 39 Japanese fighters over Empress Augusta Bay, Bougainville. As the Japanese fighters fled back to their base, VF-17 was responsible for downing 3 fighters and damaging 4 others. Though outnumbered, the squadron survived the encounter with no losses. This action was typical of the squadron's land-based service in the Solomon Islands in 1943 and 1944, when it went up against the cream of Imperial Japanese Navy pilots then based at Rabaul. In its two tours of duty in the Solomon Islands, VF-17 had 152 aerial victories and produced 11 aces. VF-17 finished its combat tour on 10 May 1944, and was equipped with the F6F-5 Hellcat moved to the . The squadron amassed 161 victories, and produced 12 aces. Overall, the two combat tours of VF-17 were credited with 313 victories, the most of any US Navy squadron. =Postwar= In the postwar period the squadron flew the F4U-4 Corsair, F8F-2 Bearcat, F9F-2 Panther, F9F-8 Cougar and F3H-2M Demon. It was disestablished on 15 April 1959. Following its disestablishment, two other U.S. Naval Aviation squadrons have used the name and insignia of the Jolly Roger: VF-84 (1955-95) and VFA-103.

These are all distinctly different squadrons that have no lineal linkage. Three of these squadrons have used the Jolly Roger name, the skull and crossbones insignia and traditions at various times. The VF-84 Jolly Rogers (1955‚Äì95) are the main topic of this article. After the disestablishment of VF-84 in 1995, VF-103 Sluggers changed their squadron's name and insignia to that of the Jolly Rogers. Operational history VF-84 FJ-3M on the USS Forrestal. The third VF-84, initially known as the Vagabonds, was established on July 1, 1955, at NAS Oceana flying the FJ-3 Fury. After deactivation of VF-61 in 1959, VF-84's commanding officer, formerly with VF-61, requested to change his squadron's name and insignia to that of the Jolly Rogers. His request was approved on April 1, 1960. The squadron then was reassigned to Carrier Air Wing Seven and made a single deployment on the in 1958/59. The squadron transitioned to the F8U-2 Crusader in 1959. VF-84 deployed aboard Independence during the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Bay of Pigs incident, the squadron made several Mediterranean cruises on board the Independence. The squadron flew the F-8C Crusaders for several years prior to being introduced to the F-4B during 1964. A VF-84 F-8C Crusader aboard USS Independence, 1963. In 1964, VF-84 transitioned to the F-4 Phantom II and flew the F-4B, F-4J and the F-4N until they transitioned to the F-14 Tomcat in early 1976. In 1965 the squadron deployed for 7 months on board Independence in the Gulf of Tonkin and flew 1507 combat sorties, logging 2200 flight hours over both North Vietnam and South Vietnam. From 1970 to 1975, VF-84 was assigned to Carrier Air Wing Six aboard the for four deployments to the Mediterranean Sea. Roosevelt's twenty-first Sixth Fleet deployment was marked by indirect participation in the October 1973 Yom Kippur War, as she served as a transit \\"landing field\\" for aircraft being delivered to Israel. The Roosevelt battlegroup, Task Force 60.2, also stood by for possible evacuation contingencies. Planes of VF-84 (temporarily assigned to VF-41 for the 1973-74 cruise and operating with VF-41 markings) escorted US transport planes to within 150 miles of Israel during Operation Nickel Grass, the resupply of Israel. F-4Bs of VF-84, flying from Independence in 1965-67. After its transition to the F-14 was completed, the squadron embarked on its first cruise on Nimitz in December 1977. In 1979 the unit was the first TARPS capable squadron of the fleet. In 1980 it participated in the motion picture The Final Countdown which propelled the skull-and-crossbones-adorned F-14's to international stardom. The movie featured a memorable scene involving two VF-84 Tomcats engaging two Japanese A6M Zeros. T-6 converted to resemble a Zero, during filming of The Final Countdown. In January 1980, Nimitz diverted from the Mediterranean to take up station in the Arabian Sea in response to the Iranian hostage crisis and in April participated in the failed hostage rescue attempt. In November 1983, the squadron embarked on an extended deployment off the coast of Beirut, Lebanon, in support of a multinational peacekeeping force. During 1985, VF-84 spent 68 days off the coast of Lebanon in response to the hijacking of TWA Flight 847. The squadron's last cruise with Nimitz lasted from December 1986 until June 1987, when Nimitz was rebased to Bremerton, WA. In October 1988, CVW-8 (the carrier wing of which VF-84 was a part) was deployed with Theodore Roosevelt, beginning in the North Atlantic for Exercise Teamwork '88 which involved operations with the Royal Norwegian Air Force. Roosevelt's first Mediterranean deployment was in December. VF-84 also did Shakedown and initial carrier qualifications for the USS Lincoln in late 1989-1990. In December 1990, Theodore Roosevelt deployed as the last carrier to join the Operation Desert Shield force. \\"TR\\" joined Ranger and Midway in the Persian Gulf and was later joined by America. Throughout the Gulf War, VF-84 flew combat air patrols for the fleet, escorting the Air Wing Eight‚Äôs strike aircraft and performing TARPS missions to collect bomb damage assessments. In total, squadron members flew 468 combat sorties. After the war, VF-84 flew an additional 111 sorties in support of Operation Provide Comfort before Roosevelt was relieved by Forrestal in June 1991.

In March 1993, VF-84 deployed again on Theodore Roosevelt, the only F-14 squadron in a reconfigured airwing that included Marine F/A-18, CH-53 and UH-1 squadrons. VF-84 flew critical TARPS reconnaissance missions during Operation Deny Flight, providing information about Bosnian Serb positions around Sarajevo. The squadron also flew in support of Operation Southern Watch, enforcing the no-fly zone over southern Iraq. VF-84 returned to NAS Oceana in September 1993. It was to be the squadron's last Mediterranean deployment. Due to the downsizing of the Navy after the Cold War, the Navy disestablished several squadrons, and VF-84 was one of them. The squadron spent its last eighteen months of existence participating in several joint service operations, honing its skills in air-to-air combat, strike and TARPS. The squadron also made another memorable appearance in another motion picture, Executive Decision. VF-84 was disestablished on October 1, 1995, but VF-103 Sluggers adopted the name and insignia of the Jolly Rogers. From its transition to the F-14 until its disestablishment, VF-84 had been a part of CVW-8. Popular culture VF-84 F-14 tail markings *The markings of Roy Focker's VF-1S Valkyrie (which was itself inspired by the F-14 Tomcat) in The Super Dimension Fortress Macross is obviously inspired by the squadron insignia of VF-84, and his \\"Skull Squadron\\" is considered the equivalent of VF-84; in the Americanized version, Robotech, the squadron was also considered to be elite. In the movie Macross: Do You Remember Love this is even more apparent, as the skull-and- crossbones insignia is worn by all Valkyries in Skull Squadron. This painting scheme has continued to be reproduced in both the prequel series Macross Zero (2002), on Focker's VF-0S experimental Valkyrie, and more recently Macross Frontier (2008), where the pilot Ozma Lee, as the senior leader of Skull Squadron, has the markings on his VF-25S. *VF-84 plays a predominant role in The Final Countdown *VF-84 Tomcats appear in a brief scene in The Philadelphia Experiment *A Jolly Rogers squadron is featured in Executive Decision film. *VF-84 is one of two squadrons that help dismantle the Soviet fighter force based on Iceland in Tom Clancy's novel Red Storm Rising See also *History of the United States Navy *List of inactive United States Navy aircraft squadrons *List of United States Navy aircraft squadrons References Further reading *Tony Holmes (2005).

Background Allison's first professional recording was \\"Who's Gonna Be the Next One Honey\\", released as a 45-rpm disc (now very rare) by a local group, Hal Goodson and the Raiders. It was also performed at the Norman Petty studio in Clovis, New Mexico, about six months before \\"Peggy Sue\\" was recorded. In their early days at the Lubbock Youth Center, in Lubbock, Texas, Allison's drumming was the sole accompaniment to Buddy Holly's vocals and guitar, allowing Holly to perform some of his best guitar work. Over time, Allison's rhythm backup ranged from slapping his hands on his knees or clapping his hands to a modal plainness of cymbal drumming. His snappy cracks at the snare drum gave power to the songs released under the Crickets' name. Songs released under Holly's name, were softer in tone and filled with innocence and longing. On these, Allison played only tom-toms, in keeping with the sound of the vocals. His work on the Crickets' recordings gave the records much of their distinctiveness and has influenced subsequent generations of rock and roll drummers. The recording producer Norman Petty, who was also Holly's manager, often manipulated songwriting credits. Allison, who was credited with another song to which he contributed little, helped to compose the music for some of the famous songs, notably \\"That'll Be the Day\\" and \\"Peggy Sue\\" (Allison later married Peggy Sue Gerron (1940-2018), after whom the song was named, who in her biography quoted Allison saying he did not write it‚Äî\\"Buddy did\\"). Holly had recorded \\"That'll Be the Day\\" before he started working with Petty, so the inclusion of Petty's name in the songwriting credit for the later version by the Crickets illustrates the manipulation of the credits. Allison has referred in several published interviews to his role in composing \\"Not Fade Away\\", which was credited to Norman Petty and \\"Charles Hardin\\" (Holly's first and middle names‚Äîhe was born Charles Hardin Holley). Allison did not sing on the Crickets' records made with Holly‚Äîdespite the misleading crediting of the band as \\"vocal group with instrumental accompaniment\\"‚Äîbut in 1958 he released the single \\"Real Wild Child\\" (having heard Johnny O'Keefe play the original during the Crickets' brief visit to Australia that year), which he recorded under the pseudonym Ivan, with Holly playing guitar and singing backing vocals. It was a minor chart entry in 1958 and the first studio recording of the song, which became a rock standard. Allison also sang on a few later releases by the Crickets, both singles and album tracks. Allison also worked as a session musician. For example, he played on the studio recording of the Everly Brothers' \\"(Till) I Kissed You\\" in 1959. Peggy Sue According to Holly's biographer John Goldrosen, the song \\"Peggy Sue\\" was originally named after Holly's niece, Cindy Lou, but the name was changed at Allison's request: Peggy Sue was Allison's girlfriend and later wife, Peggy Sue Gerron (1940‚Äì2018), and the altered title was a way of asking her to come back after a breakup. Career after Holly After Holly's death in 1959, Allison continued his musical career. He retained control of the band's name and has toured and recorded with a group as the Crickets. The members of the group have changed over time, but the most consistent members have been the bassist Joe B. Mauldin, who was in the Crickets with Holly, and the guitarist and singer Sonny Curtis, who played with Holly before the Crickets were formed in 1957 and rejoined shortly after Holly's death. Others who were in the band at one time or another include Glen D. Hardin, who was also a member of Elvis Presley's live band; Albert Lee, who was also once a member of Emmylou Harris's Hot Band; and several lead vocalists, including Earl Sinks, David Box and Jerry Naylor. The band's last recordings for the Coral label included several singles, which were incorporated in the 1960 album In Style with the Crickets. The rock classic \\"I Fought the Law\\", written by Curtis, first appeared there, and tracks from singles released after Holly's death included their version of Holly's \\"Love's Made a Fool of You\\", a chart entry for them in the UK in late 1959, and the Allison‚ÄìCurtis composition \\"More Than I Can Say\\", which was later recorded by Leo Sayer and other artists. Allison switched the band's contract to Liberty Records in 1960, after they had supported the Everly Brothers on a UK tour. He moved his base to Los Angeles, where an old Texas friend, Snuff Garrett, was a senior producer at Liberty. Allison, Curtis and another former Holly sideman, Tommy Allsup, effectively became the core the Liberty house band, working with Bobby Vee, Johnny Burnette and others. In this period they also played as backing musicians on tracks by Eddie Cochran and, according to some reports, Conway Twitty. Both Allison and Curtis were drafted into military service at different times during this period, which introduced some discontinuity in the personnel of the Crickets. Curtis also began to establish a solo career as a songwriter and singer-guitarist. In the late 1970s, the band toured with Waylon Jennings, another one-time Holly sideman. In more recent years, the Crickets have released albums, including collaborations with artists who recognize their influence in early rock and roll: Nanci Griffith (with whom they have also toured), Eric Clapton, Paul McCartney, Johnny Rivers, Waylon Jennings, Bobby Vee, and others. In 2007, Allison was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, Tennessee, as a member of the Crickets. In 2012, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Crickets by a special committee, aimed at correcting the mistake of not including the Crickets with Buddy Holly when he was first inducted in 1986. With the death of Crickets bassist Joe B. Mauldin in 2015, Allison is the sole surviving member of the Crickets from their late-1950s heyday.

VFA-103 flies the F/A-18F Super Hornet and is based at Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia (US). The squadron's radio callsign is Victory and it is assigned to Carrier Air Wing Seven. Insignia and nicknames VF-103 \\"Sluggers\\" original insignia. The original VF-103 squadron insignia was a cloverleaf, and the aircraft tailfins had a horizontal yellow arrow outlined in black. Later a stylized aircraft darting through the leaf was added, along with a baseball bat. The baseball bat stemmed from an early skipper who often carried one with him. In 1991, VF-103's aircraft used the squadron insignia for tail-art, in place of the bold arrow. When the Sluggers became the Jolly Rogers following the disestablishment of VF-84 (1955-95), they adopted the famous white skull-and- crossbones. The Jolly Rogers have always displayed some of the most recognizable squadron markings in the world: sinister white skull-and- crossbones on all-black tails, with gold bands wrapped around the tip of the tail fins, and black bands with gold chevrons (known as vagabonds strips from the Crusader days of VF-84) run down the sides of the forward fuselage. History Four distinct U.S. Naval Aviation squadrons have used the name and insignia of the Jolly Roger: VF-17, VF-61, VF-84, and VF-103, since redesignated as VFA-103. While these are distinctly different squadrons that have no lineal linkage, they all share the same Jolly Roger name, the skull and crossbones insignia and traditions. After disestablishment of VF-84 in 1995, the Jolly Rogers name and insignia were adopted by VF-103, which later became VFA-103, the subject of this article. There has been only one squadron designated VF-103. =1950s= F9F-6 Cougars over , 1954. VF-103 (the \\"Sluggers\\") were activated on 1 May 1952 and equipped with the FG-1D Corsair. The squadron was assigned to Carrier Air Group 10 (CVG-10) and made a short cruise aboard in late 1952. Thereafter, VF-103 transitioned to the F9F-6 Cougar and adopted the nickname \\"Flying Cougars\\". CVG-10 went aboard for her shakedown cruise following her reactivation to the Caribbean between August and November 1953. The air group was then reassigned to and VF-103 was equipped with the F9F-8B. The carrier was deployed to the Mediterranean Sea between August 1956 and February 1957. This was the last time that VF-103 operated from a straight-deck carrier. In 1957, VF-103 was one of the first squadrons to transition to the supersonic F8U-1 Crusader, and was renamed \\"Sluggers\\". Once the transition was completed they were teamed up with VF-102 on board . Prior to the introduction of the Crusader jets, U.S. Navy carrier battle groups were often embarrassed by British bombers during allied exercises as the RAF English Electric Canberras had always been able to make mock attacks on U.S. carriers with impunity. At the time, the U.S. fighters simply could not put up much resistance. During the 1958 Mediterranean cruise, British pilots were surprised when VF-103 tore through their formation of Canberras before they even had a chance to start their simulated attack. F8U-2s from USS Forrestal and VF-103 were deployed to the Mediterranean Sea during the 1958 Lebanon crisis but the crisis had abated before the carrier reached its station. A regular deployment followed between September 1958 and March 1959. Future astronaut John W. Young was a squadron member during this cruise.USS Forrestal CVA-59 Mediterranean Cruise Book 1958-59 =1960s= VF-103 was reequipped with the F8U-2 (F-8C after 1962) and reassigned to CVG-8, although still assigned to USS Forrestal. Three other deployments to the Mediterranean followed in 1960, 1961 and 1964-1965. The squadron was reequipped with the F-8E in 1964. The 1964-1965 cruise was significant, as VF-103 flew both the F-8E and the newly introduced F-4B Phantom II. VF-103 would fly the Phantom for 19 years. From 1965 to 1980, VF-103 was assigned to Carrier Air Wing 3 (CVW-3). Even longer was the assignment to , from 1965 to 1994, since 1984 as part of CVW-17. VF-103 was aboard Saratoga for 15 deployments to the Mediterranean Sea, plus a single one aboard Forrestal in 1982. VF-103 flew the F-4B until transitioning to the F-4J in 1968. In 1981, the squadron was reequipped with the F-4S. =1970s= F-4J Phantom II in 1978 When North Vietnam launched its Easter Offensive invasion of South Vietnam, USS Saratoga was deployed to the coast of Vietnam to participate in Operation Linebacker. On 10 August 1972, Lieutenant Commander Robert Tucker and Lieutenant Junior Grade Stanley Edens shot down a Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 with an AIM-7 Sparrow missile during a night interception. It was the first and only night MiG kill by the US Navy. =1980s= In January 1983, VF-103 was among the last fighter squadrons to transition to the F-14A Tomcat. The squadron conducted the first East Coast fighter squadron‚Äôs low altitude AIM-54 Phoenix missile shoot a month later. In October 1985, VF-103 and VF-74 participated in the interception of the Egyptian Boeing 737 carrying the Achille Lauro hijackers. During a long range night intercept by VF-74 and VF-103, the 737 was forced to land at Naval Air Station Sigonella, Sicily. The terrorists were taken into Italian custody, tried and sentenced. VF-103 and the rest of the airwing participated in Operation Attain Document and Operation El Dorado Canyon in the spring of 1986. In 1989, VF-103 transitioned to the F-14A+ (later redesignated F-14B). =1990s= F-14A+ Tomcats en route to Iraq while flying off Saratoga during the Gulf War. In August 1990 when Kuwait was invaded by Iraq, USS Saratoga was in the Mediterranean and soon joined in the Red Sea. VF-103 and VF-74 worked together to develop the fighter tactics which were during the Gulf War. When the war started in January 1991, VF-103 conducted fighter escort for the air wing‚Äôs strike packages, reconnaissance and bomb damage assessment and combat air patrols. On the fourth day of the war, while on an escort mission, a VF-103 F-14A+ was shot down by what is believed to be an SA-2 \\"Guideline\\" surface-to-air missile. After ejecting from his aircraft, the Radar Intercept Officer, Lieutenant Larry Slade, was captured by Iraqi troops and held in Baghdad as a POW until the end of the war. The pilot, Lieutenant Devon Jones, was able to evade capture and, after eight hours deep in enemy territory, was rescued by USAF Special Operations Forces. On 1 October 1995, VF-84 was disestablished bringing an end to the Jolly Rogers. Not wanting the Jolly Rogers insignia to fade away from U.S. Naval Aviation, VF-103 requested to do away with their \\"Slugger\\" moniker and adopt the Jolly Rogers name and insignia that had been previously used by VF-84. Also in 1995, VF-103 conducted the fleet feasibility testing of the U.S. Air Force's LANTIRN targeting pod in a rapid prototyping initiative that led to adoption of the LANTIRN for the Tomcat community. When they deployed with in the summer of 1996, VF-103 became the first Tomcat squadron to introduce the LANTIRN targeting pod to operational service. The LANTIRN radically improved the F-14's strike capabilities by providing an autonomous precision strike capability. In 1997 VF-103 transferred from USS Enterprise to , and set sail to former Yugoslavia in June 1998 in support of NATO operations in Kosovo. In November, the carrier moved to the Persian Gulf in response to aggressive Iraqi posturing. =2000s= VF-103 F-14B in high visibility markings In June 2002, VF-103 and its carrier deployed to the North Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf and participated in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Southern Watch. VF-103 supported Coalition forces in Afghanistan flying Close Air Support, Forward Air Controller and TARPS missions. VF-103 was already on their way home by the start of Operation Iraqi Freedom in early 2003. VF-103 returned to the Persian Gulf for its final Tomcat cruise with on 10 July 2004 and ten days later the squadron bombed an insurgent position. The unit participated in Operation Phantom Fury in October 2004 to provide aerial support over Fallujah for the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force and Iraqi Army soldiers. During one mission an F-14 from VF-103 provided laser designation for an AH-1W Super Cobra helicopter‚Äôs AGM-114 Hellfire missile to destroy a building where insurgents had taken cover. This operation had never previously been attempted with a Hellfire, but the missile successfully hit the building, neutralizing the enemy fire that the US troops were receiving. The F-14 crew was ordered to two drop additional GBU-12 laser- guided bombs on the building, leveling the structure. After a last deployment USS John F. Kennedy with CVW-17 and returning to NAS Oceana in December 2004, VF-103 retired their F-14B Tomcats and began transition to the F/A-18F Super Hornet and transfer to Carrier Air Wing Seven (CVW-7). Following their transition to the F/A-18F, the squadron was officially re-designated as VFA-103 in February 2005. The first deployment with the F/A-18F commenced in 2006 and ended in the spring of 2007. During the cruise with USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, VFA-103 and VFA-143 supported Operations Iraqi Freedom, Enduring Freedom and operations off the Somali coast, and combined with VFA-131 and VFA-83, they dropped 140 precision guided weapons and performed nearly 70 strafing runs. For their outstanding performance on this deployment, VFA-103 was awarded the AIRLANT Battle \\"E\\" for both 2006 & 2007, as well as the Wade McClusky Award as the best Attack Squadron in the US Navy for 2007.

On 27 July 2010, the squadron returned home to NAS Oceana after completion of their latest deployment. After a successful maintenance and workup cycle, VFA-103 embarked with CVW-7 on board USS Dwight D. Eisenhower on 22 June 2012 for a scheduled nine-month deployment in the 5th Fleet Area of Operations. However, due to changes in operational requirements, VFA-103, CVW-7 and Dwight D. Eisenhower returned to NAS Oceana on 21 December 2012, to perform maintenance in preparation of returning to sea shortly thereafter. VFA-103 returned to sea on 21 February 2013 after the short turnaround, and along with the rest of CVW-7 and Carrier Strike Group Eight, supported operations in the 5th Fleet Area of Operations. After a combined eleven months at sea in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and Persian Gulf presence operations, the squadron returned to NAS Oceana on 3 July 2013. In honor of the Jolly Rogers' 70th anniversary, the squadron undertook a massive redesign of the immensely recognizable skull and crossbones insignia, choosing to feature the original VF-17 patches, colors, and tail fin. The Jolly Rogers' F/A-18Fs were seen launching from USS Harry Truman in June 2016 participating in Operation Inherent Resolve, striking Daesh targets in Iraq and Syria, with multiple aircraft exhibiting signs of heavy combat, with a number of front fuselages being covered with bomb silhouettes representing munitions being dropped in combat air strikes.

The parkland, on the transformed site of Brisbane's World Expo 88, was officially opened to the public on 20 June 1992. The South Bank Parklands are located on the southern bank of the Brisbane River, at South Bank, directly opposite the City. The parklands are connected to the City by the Victoria Bridge at the northern end, and to Gardens Point by the Goodwill Bridge at the southern end. The parklands consist of a mixture of rainforest, water, grassed areas and plazas as well as features such as the riverfront promenade, the Streets Beach, the Grand Arbour, the Courier Mail Piazza, the Nepalese Peace Pagoda, the Wheel of Brisbane, restaurants, shops and fountains. The parklands are also home to the Queensland Conservatorium. South Bank and its parklands are one of Brisbane's most important cultural precincts and they regularly host large scale festivals and events. Approximately 11,000,000 people visit South Bank Parklands each year. History South Bank was originally a meeting place for the traditional landowners, the Turrbal and Yuggera people and, in the early 1840s it became the central focus point of early European settlement. From the 1850s, South Bank Precinct was quickly established as the business centre of Brisbane. However, this was all disrupted when the 1893 Brisbane floods forced the central business district to shift to the northern side of the river and attain higher ground. This is where the Brisbane central business district still stands today. This began the decline of South Bank, and the area became home to vaudeville theatres, derelict boarding houses, and light and heavy industry. The 1970s marked the beginnings of a new era, with parkland reclaimed along the river bank, and the Queensland Cultural Centre was built which included the Queensland Art Gallery, the Queensland Museum, the Queensland Performing Arts Centre and State Library of Queensland (today it also includes the Queensland Gallery of Modern Art). A panoramic view of Streets Beach In 1988, Brisbane held a successful World Expo 88, following which the Government intended to develop the site for commercial interests. However, a public campaign successfully lobbied for the site to be redeveloped as parkland for the enjoyment of people in Brisbane.

The sand surrounding the beach is sourced from the Rous Channel in Moreton Bay and every year the beach is topped up with an additional 70 tonnes to ensure that it is kept in pristine condition. Almost half of the lagoon area sits on reclaimed land that was once the Brisbane River. The beach was designed by Desmond Brookes International and was constructed by Fletcher Jennings Construction and Water and Industrial Engineering. Construction commenced in February 1991 and was complete by June 1992. The lagoon contains chlorinated fresh water that is recirculated every six hours at up to 125 litres per second. Water for the beach is pumped through two large sand filters and chemically treated before being pumped back into the pools. Dredge pump and self-propelled sifting machines clean the adjoining pools. The beach has received awards including the 1999 Moreton Bay region's cleanest beach in the Keep Australia Beautiful Council's Clean Beach Challenge and the 2001 Environmental Protection Agency's Keep Australia Beautiful Clean Beach Challenge, Friendliest Beach Award. The beach area comprises a lagoon with enough water to fill five Olympic swimming pools, with sand beaches, palm trees, rocky creeks and subtropical trees and exotic plantings.

So I set my letter in, and duly arrived up at Havelock House, with amateur tapes that I had made of comedy sketches that I was performing in my kitchen, and bathroom, and bedroom... and I presented those and they listened to them and said, 'Yes, those are quite funny, but there's no opening for that sort of thing here at the moment.

Early life Shaw was born in Chicago, Illinois to Edgar Shaw, a railroad employee and house painter, and Camilla (Murphy) Shaw, a housekeeper. He attended the University of Illinois at Chicago from 1963 to 1968. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps, including stints in Hawaii and at Marine Corps Air Station, Cherry Point, North Carolina, where in 1962 he was a \\"Message Center\\" specialist, achieving the rank of Corporal, E-4. He exhibited a passionate interest in the print media, clipping articles from newspapers, and often traveled on weekends to Washington, D.C. He cultivated an acquaintance with Walter Cronkite and had an interest in baseball. Career Shaw began his broadcasting career as an anchor and reporter for WNUS in Chicago. He then worked as a reporter for the Westinghouse Broadcasting Company in Chicago, moving later to Washington as the White House correspondent. He worked as a correspondent in the Washington Bureau of CBS News from 1971 to 1977. In 1977, he moved to ABC News as Latin American correspondent and bureau chief before becoming the Capitol Hill Senior Correspondent. He left ABC in 1980 to move to CNN as co-anchor of its PrimeNews broadcast, anchoring from Washington, D.C.. Shaw is widely known for the question he posed to Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Michael Dukakis at his second Presidential debate with George H. W. Bush during the 1988 election, which Shaw was moderating. Knowing that Dukakis opposed the death penalty, Shaw asked him if he would support an irrevocable death penalty for a man who hypothetically raped and murdered Dukakis's wife. Dukakis responded that he would not; critics felt he framed his response too legalistically and logically, and did not address it sufficiently on a personal level. Kitty Dukakis, among other public figures, found the question inflammatory and unwarranted at a presidential debate. Several journalists also on the panel with Shaw, including Ann Compton, Andrea Mitchell, and Margaret Garrard Warner, expressed an interest in leaving Dukakis's name out of the question. He is also remembered for his reporting on the 1991 Gulf War. Reporting with CNN correspondents John Holliman and Peter Arnett from the Al- Rashid Hotel in Baghdad, he found shelter under a desk as he reported cruise missiles flying past his window. He also made frequent trips back and forth from the hotel's bomb shelter. While describing the situation in Baghdad, he famously stated \\"Clearly I've never been there, but this feels like we're in the center of hell.\\" He moderated the October 2000 vice-presidential debate between Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman. Shaw co-anchored CNN's Inside Politics from 1992 until he retired from CNN in 2001. He has still occasionally appeared on CNN, including in May 2005 when a plane flew into restricted air space in Washington, D.C. He also co-anchored Judy Woodruff's last broadcast on CNN in June 2005. Shaw noted that after 41 years in the business, given what he missed in his personal life, the cost was not worth it. Shaw appeared on the June 1, 2020 episode of CNN's Erin Burnett OutFront to recognize the 40th anniversary of the start of the network. Accolades * 1994: Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism. * 1996: Paul White Award, Radio Television Digital News Association * Bernard Shaw was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State's highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in 2002 in the area of Communications.

With international touring experience under his belt, Bronson joined Treble Charger for their Detox tour from 2003 to 2004, after the departure of lead guitarist Bill Priddle. Bronson was set to join the band in the studio for their 6th album when he accepted the invitation to take over as lead guitarist and musical director for Avril Lavigne's, which was previously held by Evan Taubenfeld. Bronson's first performance with Avril Lavigne's band was at the 2004 Fashion Rocks! concert in New York where Avril performed 'Iris' by The Goo Goo Dolls with Johnny Rzeznik. Bronson was given only a few days to learn how to play the mandolin for that performance. Bronson has since joined Lavigne on multiple world tours, TV appearances, music videos and the 2010 Olympic Closing Ceremonies. Most recently, Bronson appeared in Lavigne's video for \\"Here's to Never Growing Up\\"./photo/1 Bronson took time in 2006 to tour with Ashley Parker Angel promoting his single during acoustic shows and TV appearances. In 2007, Bronson and Taubelfeld began working on an album with producer John Fields for the band The Blacklist Club. The album was ultimate released as a solo album for Taubenfled entitled, \\"Welcome to the Blacklist Club\\". Bronson joined Taubenfeld for a full band show at the Roxy in LA and an acoustic set during Avril Lavigne's Fairfax, VA show in 2008. In the summer of 2008, Bronson joined Butch Walker on stage for a host of shows including Lollapalooza. This led Bronson to working with P!nk whom he joined on stage to promote her single So What during TV appearances including the MTV Music Video Awards. In 2011, Bronson was asked to join American Idol Season 7 winner David Cook's band. As the band's lead guitarist, Bronson took part in the This Loud Morning Tour as well as multiple TV appearances and international shows. In 2014, Bronson joined Sebastian Bach on tour. Playing Sum 41 songs, Bronson joined Deryck Whibley and The Happiness Machines in 2015 for a short California tour. Other work When not on tour, Bronson writes music for a wide array of TV including Californication on Showtime and Hellcats as well as movies including Friends with Benefits, 22 Jump Street and Home Sweet Hell starring Katherine Heigl. Bronson puts in studio time collaborating with multiple artists, including work on Mike Posner's 2nd studio album and co- writing 12 Stones \\"Blind\\" with Christine Connolly and Tyler Connolly of Theory of a Deadman. Bronson also played all the guitar solos on Demi Lovato's La La Land single. Co-writer and co-producer Nick Jonas originally wanted Steve Vai, but due to a schedule conflict, Bronson was asked to stepped in. Bronson is the musical director for 78 Violet duo, Aly & AJ Michalka, co-writing two songs on their upcoming studio album produced by David Kahne. He was also the musical director for \\"Redd\\" by U.G.L.Y, the newest addition to Chris Brown's label.

In the , South Brisbane had a population of 7,196 people. Geography The suburb is on the southern bank of the Brisbane River, bounded to the north-west, north, and east by the river. The river to the east of the suburb is the South Brisbane Reach.(). The suburb is directly connected to the central business district across the river by the following bridges (upstream to downsteam): * Go Between Bridge (toll road, ) * William Jolly Bridge (road, ) * Merivale Bridge (rail, ) * Kurilpa Bridge (pedestrian/cycling, ) * Victoria Bridge (road, ) * Goodwill Bridge (pedestrian/cycling, ). Modern public transport services include suburban train stations at South Brisbane and South Bank, and South East Busway stations at Cultural Centre, South Bank, and Mater Hill. CityCat ferry services link South Brisbane to other riverside suburbs. History left left South Brisbane together with West End and Highgate Hill is known as Kurilpa (meaning water rat) by the local Indigenous people and the area remains important in Indigenous life. Musgrave Park has been for many years a place of congregation for the Murri peoples of south-east Queensland. It is the site of a bora ring that has been buried. The Ngundari and Jagara groups were drawn to the river at South Brisbane for fishing and gunyah building. The area was named South Brisbane because it was on the south side of the Brisbane River relative to North Brisbane (now the present Brisbane CBD) during the era of the Moreton Bay penal colony (1824-1842). The name Brisbane comes from the name of the river, which in turn was named by explorer John Oxley in 1823 after Sir Thomas Brisbane, then the Governor of New South Wales. European settlement commenced with the first land sales in 1843, followed by the development of wharves along the bank of the Brisbane River. The first street in the area was called Stanley Quay, later to become Stanley Street. In December 1849, the Church of England obtained a block of land facing Melbourne Street and extending to Grey Street and Stanley Street (approx , now the site of the Queensland Museum), a total of 1 acre, 3 roods, 8 perches of land, on which to erect a church, a school and a parsonage. However it is not until August 1858 that the school house was constructed on the site with the expectation that it would also be used for \\"occasional\\" public worship. The building was of hammer-dressed stone. On 6 September 1858 Miss Clothier opens a school there. In 1859 it is described as an \\"English Church\\" at \\"South Brisbane\\". By May 1862 the church has a resident minister enabling regular services. The church was adversely impacted by the construction of the 1874 Victoria Bridge as the bridge was higher and the approach roads had to be built up accordingly, resulting in the church being below the new road level, forcing the parishioners to approach the church from the rear. It is unclear when the church was named for St Thomas but that name is in use by October 1877. Commercial buildings and hotels developed around the Russell Street area. By the 1850s there were over 100 residences in the area. Due to its proximity to wharves the area became the place where bullock drovers stayed and relaxed. Thomas Baines visited Brisbane in 1855 and depicted South Brisbane in a painting titled 'South Brisbane from North Brisbane', 13 years later. South Brisbane Recreation Reserve (now known as Musgrave Park) was created in 1856. The first Presbyterian church in the district was built in Grey Street near Melbourne Street (approx ) by John Graham. It was a small weatherboard church and was officially opened on 25 May 1851 by the Reverend Thomas Mowbray. After the congregation relocated to the Park Presbyterian Church in 1885, the Grey Street building was sold and used for storage. The old Grey Street church was sold to a private firm and used for storage. Later the site was resumed and the church building demolished for the construction of the present South Brisbane railway station. A Baptist Sunday school operated in South Brisbane from 1857, but it was not until July 1872 that the Vulture Street Baptist Church opened at 218 Vulture Street (corner of Christie Street, ). It was later renamed the South Brisbane Baptist Church. The church was rebuilt in 1966, reopening on 10 December 1966. In 2003 it was renamed the South Bank Baptist Church to reflect its proximity to the South Bank Parklands. It was demolished in early 2013 when the congregation moved to a new church at 859 Stanley Street, Woolloongabba, renaming itself as Church@TheGabba. In October 1863 Bishop James Quinn called for tenders to erect a Roman Catholic church in South Brisbane. The small wooden St Mary's Church was built on the southern corner of Merivale Street and Peel Street (in the carpark of the current church, ) and was opened on 2 July 1865 by Bishop Quinn. A school was established at St Mary's Catholic Church with a lay teacher in 1866. St Mary's School opened at the school on 1870 operated by Mother Mary MacKillop and her Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart. The long-running disputes between MacKillop and James Quinn, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Brisbane, resulted Quinn expelling the Sisters from his diocese in 1880, but the school continued to operate nonetheless. South Brisbane School opened circa 1865. At some time it split into South Brisbane Boys State School and South Brisbane Girls and Infants State School. In 1929 the Boys School and the Girls and Infants were amalgamated to form two new schools, South Brisbane State School for Preparatory to Grade 5 and South Brisbane Intermediate State School for Grades 6 and 7. In 1953 the Intermediate School was amalgamated into South Brisbane State School. The school closed in 1963. In 1874 John Cani established St Kilian's College in Raymond Terrace at the site now occupied by St Laurence's College. On Tuesday 20 December 1904 it was partially demolished in a severe storm and its buildings were sold for removal. In October 1875 the congregation of St Thomas' decided to erect a new church in a more \\"central\\" location, apparently desiring a more elevated site and a more \\"pretentious\\" church. In November 1877 a building site was obtained on the corner of Vulture Street and Cordelia Street (). In June 1878 the church officials selected Andrea Strombuco's design for the new church. The foundation stone for the new St Andrew's Anglican Church was laid on Saturday 30 November 1878 by Queensland Governor Arthur Kennedy. After delays in construction due to insufficient money, the new church was officially opened and dedicated on Wednesday 6 June 1883 by Bishop Matthew Hale assisted by Archdeacon Benjamin Glennie with over 500 people present. St Thomas' church then closed. In 1884, the railway to the south was opened with a terminus at South Brisbane. As a result, South Brisbane experienced a construction boom. In 1888, South Brisbane became an independent municipality, initially as the Borough of South Brisbane and then becoming the City of South Brisbane in 1903. In 1925 the City of South Brisbane was amalgamated into the City of Greater Brisbane. The first electric tramway in Brisbane ran along Stanley Street in South Brisbane on 16 June 1897. Former Park Presbyterian Church (now the iSEE church), 2020 By the 1880s, the Presbyterian church in Grey Street had grown too small for its congregation. On October 1884 a foundation stone for a new church was laid. On 11 October 1885 the new Park Presbyterian Church was opened at 31 Glenelg Street on the corner of Cordelia Street () by Robert Steel, senior member of the Presbyterian Church in Sydney. The name Park reflects the location of the church directly opposite Musgrave Park. It was designed by architect FDG Stanley and could accommodate 550 seated in the church and 300 seated in the Sunday school in the basement. Over time the area became increasingly used for industrial and commercial purposes and families moved away to more residential areas. The congregation sold the church in early 1950 in order to build a new Park Presbyterian Church in the more residential location of 21 Hampstead Road, Highgate Hill. The church at Glenelg Street was used by the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church for some years, then for commercial purposes, and as at 2020 by the iSee Church (Pentecostal). 1893 sketch from Peel Street of the first St Mary's Church (demolished) and the proposed second St Mary's Church (never fully completed) Similarly St Mary's Catholic Church became too small for its congregation. From 1884 to 1889 the Catholic Church had acquired more land adjoining St Mary's Catholic, eventually owning all of the northern end of the block bounded by Cordelia, Peel and Merivale Streets, enabling it to raise funds for a new St Mary's church in 1890. Architects George Simkin and John Ibler prepared designs for a cruciform church with Italianate and Romanesque Revival features able to seat 800 people. The foundation stone was laid by Cardinal Patrick Francis Moran on 25 September 1892. When the second St Mary's Church () was blessed and opened by Archbishop Robert Dunne on 2 July 1893, St Mary's had already cost ¬£2,150 to build and it had been decided to defer the contruction of the tower, transepts and chancel to a later time, but they were never built. However, in 1929 a sanctuary (including vestry and sacristy) designed by architects Cavanagh and Cavanagh was added to the eastern side of the church. The Sisters of Mercy opened a new St Mary's School in 1909. The school closed in 1964. In June 1888 the first Catholic Apostolic Church in Queensland was opened at 16 Manning Street (). Designed by architect Leslie Corrie, the church interior was with one third of its length used for the chancel. The building was designed with the expectation of enlarging it at a later stage. The church was burned down on Saturday 21 July 1917. In October 1917 architect George Addison called for tenders to construct a new brick church on the site. Their minister Joseph Todd Young died on 22 February 1932 and the church continued to operate under its deacons until the death of the last deacon in 1957. In 1962 the church building was bought by the Anglican Church. In 1919 the Brisbane High School for Girls (now Somerville House) was relocated to the property Cumbooqueepa in Vulture Street in South Brisbane (), adjacent to the South Brisbane Town Hall (which since 15 June 1999 forms part of the school). The school was opened on 6 October 1899 by Eliza Fewings in the basement of the Baptist City Tabernacle at 183 Wickham Terrace, relocating to Erneton (also in Wickham Terrace( in 1912. The school was purchased by the Presbyterian and Methodist Schools Association in 1918.South Brisbane Memorial Park, 2010 St Laurence's College for boys was officially opened and blessed on Sunday 11 July 1915 by the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Brisbane James Duhig. The school was operated by the Christian Brothers. The South Brisbane Memorial Park commemorates those of South Brisbane who died in World War I. On 20 May 1921 the South Brisbane City Council set aside a triangular block land bounded by Stanley Street, Vulture Street and Sidon Street () opposite the South Brisbane Town Hall. On 6 August 1923 the park was dedicated by the Governor- General of Australia, Henry Forster. In 1925 Brisbane State High School moved to its current site at Vulture Street, South Brisbane, a location which had been proposed as a site for a public grammar school back in 1867. The school was originally established on 1 July 1921 at the old Brisbane Normal School building on the corner of Adelaide and Edward Streets in the Brisbane CBD) as an amalgamation of the High School Department of the Brisbane Central Technical College and Brisbane Junior State High School. The first students were admitted on 4 July 1921. On 10 May 1931 a second St Thomas' Anglican Church was established at 68 Grey Street (approx ) to the immediate north of Fish Lane (which then extended through to Stanley Street), very close to the site of the first St Thomas' church. It was under the control of St Andrew's Anglican Church. It was built from white stucco. It was to serve as a mission church in a largely industrial area with many wharves. It is unclear when this church closed (presumably before the third St Thomas's Anglican Church opened in 1962) and this church building no longer exists.St Clement's Melkite Catholic Church, 2020 Brisbane's Melkite Catholic community initially worshipped at St Mary's Roman Catholic Church in South Brisbane. In 1929 the community had purchased land at 72 Ernest Street () and a foundation stone was laid by Roman Catholic Archbishop James Duhig and Lebanese Bishop Clement Malouf on Sunday 24 March 1929. The ceremony was to be performed on previous Sunday 17 March 1929 but rain forced it to be postponed, but the foundation stone was already inscribed with the earlier date. However, raising funds to build the church was difficult during the Great Depression and it was not until 29 March 1936 that St Clement's Melkite Catholic Church was officially opened by Archbishop Duhig. South Brisbane gained a seedy reputation with many pubs, brothels and boarding houses among warehouses with few homes. During World War II when the there was a large American military presence in Brisbane, the desire to separate the white and black American troops (segregration being the norm in some parts of the United States at that time) saw South Brisbane unofficially declared the city's 'black' area, leaving the white troops to enjoy the better parts of the city. St George's Greek Orthodox Church, 2020 The Greek Association of Brisbane was established in 1913. In May 1921 it established a community centre in Charlotte Street in the Brisbane CBD, followed by St George's Greek Orthodox Church on the same site in 1929. However, the growth in Brisbane's Greek population, particularly after World War II, resulted in a need for a larger church. A new St George's Greek Orthodox Church was built at 33 Edmondstone Street (corner Besant Street) in South Brisbane (). The foundation stone was laid on 4 May 1958 by Archbishop Theophylactos. The finished church was opened and dedicated on 24 April 1960 by Archbishop Ezekiel. The architect was Ronald Martin Wilson. The church is octagonal with an octagonal dome and is richly decorated internally in the Greek Orthodox tradition. A new Greek community centre (now known as The Greek Club) was built beside the church at 37 Edmondstone Street (), opening in 1976. Catholic Apostolic Church, later the third St Thomas' Anglican Church, 2020 In 1962, the Anglican Church established their third St Thomas' Church at 16 Manning Street () to replace the second St Thomas's Church of England in Grey Street by purchasing the Catholic Apostolic Church. The Anglican Church ceased to use Manning Street Church in 1979 and sold it in 1984 and, although the 1920s church building still exists, it is no longer used for religion purposes and has been used as commercial premises and as a private home. The name Callan House is displayed on the front of the building. 1974 flood in South Brisbane The suburb became heavily industrialised. Being adjacent to the Brisbane River, the suburb and its industries suffered in the 1974 Brisbane flood. Mater Hospital Special School opened on 3 January 1981. On 1 December 2014 it was renamed the Lady Cilento Children's Hospital School. On 1 January 2019 it was renamed Queensland Children's Hospital School. Its regeneration began when it was selected as the location of World Expo '88, which was built on former wharves and industrial land. Following Expo '88, South Bank Parklands was built on the former Expo site. South Brisbane has emerged as fashionable, high density, modern residential area, given its proximity to the city centre and good public transport links. In the the population of South Brisbane was 5,416. In the , South Brisbane had a population of 7,196 people. Heritage listings Being one of the older parts of Brisbane and an area of greater cultural heritage, South Brisbane has many heritage-listed buildings.  Education  Somerville House is a private primary and secondary (Prep-12) school for girls at 17 Graham Street ().

The various cultures collectively termed \\"Mound Builders\\" were inhabitants of North America who, during a 5,000-year period, constructed various styles of earthen mounds for religious, ceremonial, burial, and elite residential purposes. These included the pre-Columbian cultures of the Archaic period, Woodland period (Calusa culture, Adena and Hopewell cultures), and Mississippian period; dating from roughly 3500 BCE (the construction of Watson Brake) to the 16th century CE, and living in regions of the Great Lakes, the Ohio River Valley, and the Mississippi River valley and its tributary waters.Squier p. 1 Since the 19th century, the prevailing scholarly consensus has been that the mounds were constructed by indigenous peoples of the Americas. Sixteenth-century Spanish explorers met natives living in a number of later Mississippian cities, described their cultures, and left artifacts.Constance E. Richards, \\"Contact and Conflict\\", American Archaeologist, Spring 2004, accessed 26 Jun 2008 Research and study of these cultures and peoples has been based mostly on archaeology and anthropology. Woodland culture A mound diagram of the platform mound showing the multiple layers of mound construction, mound structures such as temples or mortuaries, ramps with log stairs, and prior structures under later layers, multiple terraces, and intrusive burials The namesake cultural trait of the Mound Builders was the building of mounds and other earthworks. These burial and ceremonial structures were typically flat-topped pyramids or platform mounds, flat-topped or rounded cones, elongated ridges, and sometimes a variety of other forms. They were generally built as part of complex villages. The early earthworks built in Louisiana around 3500 BCE are the only ones known to have been built by a hunter-gatherer culture. The best-known flat-topped pyramidal structure, which at more than tall is the largest pre- Columbian earthwork north of Mexico, is Monks Mound at Cahokia near present- day Collinsville, Illinois. At its maximum about 1150 CE, Cahokia was an urban settlement with 20,000‚Äì30,000 people; this population was not exceeded by North American European settlements until after 1800. A depiction of the Serpent Mound in southern Ohio, as published in the magazine The Century, April 1890 Some effigy mounds were constructed in the shapes or outlines of culturally significant animals. The most famous effigy mound, Serpent Mound in southern Ohio, ranges from to just over tall, wide, more than long, and shaped as an undulating serpent. Many different tribal groups and chiefdoms, involving an array of beliefs and unique cultures over thousands of years, built mounds as expressions of their cultures. The general term, \\"mound builder\\", covered their shared architectural practice of earthwork mound construction. This practice, believed to be associated with a cosmology that had a cross-cultural appeal, may indicate common cultural antecedents. The first mound building was an early marker of political and social complexity among the cultures in the Eastern United States. Watson Brake in Louisiana, constructed about 3500 BCE during the Middle Archaic period, is the oldest dated mound complex in North America. It is one of 11 mound complexes from this period found in the Lower Mississippi Valley.Robert W. Preucel, Stephen A. Mrozowski, Contemporary Archaeology in Theory: The New Pragmatism, John Wiley & Sons, 2010, p. 177 These mound builders were organized; hundreds or even thousands of workers had to dig up tons of earth with the hand tools available, the soil had to be moved long distances, and finally, workers had to create the shape the builder had planned. Archaeological surveys A depiction of the Portsmouth Earthworks in Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley The most complete reference for these earthworks is Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley, written by Ephraim G. Squier and Edwin H. Davis. It was published in 1848 by the Smithsonian Institution. Since many of the features which the authors documented have since been destroyed or diminished by farming and development, their surveys, sketches, and descriptions are still used by modern archaeologists. All of the sites which they identified as located in Kentucky came from the manuscripts of C. S. Rafinesque. Reports of early European explorers Parkin Site, thought to be the capital of the Province of Casqui visited by de Soto Hernando de Soto, the Spanish conquistador, between 1540‚Äì1542 traversed what became the southeastern United States. There he encountered many different mound-builder peoples who were perhaps descendants of the great Mississippian culture. The mound-building tradition still existed in the southeast during the mid-16th century. De Soto observed people living in fortified towns with lofty mounds and plazas, and surmised that many of the mounds served as foundations for priestly temples. Near present-day Augusta, Georgia, de Soto encountered a mound-building group ruled by a queen, Cofitachequi. She told him that the mounds within her territory served as the burial places for nobles. Engraving after Jacques le Moyne, showing the burial of a Timucua chief The artist Jacques le Moyne, who had accompanied French settlers to northeastern Florida during the 1560s, likewise noted many Native American groups using existing mounds and constructing others. He produced a series of watercolor paintings depicting scenes of native life. Although most of his paintings have been lost, some engravings were copied from the originals and published in 1591 by a Flemish company. Among these is a depiction of the burial of an aboriginal Floridian tribal chief, an occasion of great mourning and ceremony. The original caption reads: Maturin Le Petit, a Jesuit priest, met the Natchez people as did Le Page du Pratz (1758), a French explorer. Both observed them in the area that later became Mississippi. The Natchez were devout worshippers of the sun. Having a population of some 4,000, they occupied at least nine villages and were presided over by a paramount chief, known as the Great Sun, who wielded absolute power. Both observers noted the high temple mounds which the Natchez had built so that the Great Sun could commune with God, the sun. His large residence was built atop the highest mound, from \\"which, every morning, he greeted the rising sun, invoking thanks and blowing tobacco smoke to the four cardinal directions\\".Mallory O'Connor, Lost Cities of the Ancient Southeast (University Press of Florida, 1995).Ephraim Squier and Edwin Davis, Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley (Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge, vol. 1. Washington DC, 1848)Biloine Young and Melvin Fowler, Cahokia: The Great Native American Metropolis (University of Illinois Press, 2000). Later explorers to the same regions, only a few decades after mound-building settlements had been reported, found the regions largely depopulated, the residents vanished, and the mounds untended. Since little violent conflict with Europeans had occurred in that area during that period, the most plausible explanation is that infectious diseases from the Old World, such as smallpox and influenza, had decimated most of the Native Americans who had comprised the last mound-builder civilization.Davis Brose and N'omi Greber (eds.), Hopewell Archaeology (Kent State University Press, 1979)Roger Kennedy, Hidden Cities: The Discovery and Loss of Ancient North American Civilization (Free Press, 1994)Robert Silverberg, \\"...And the Mound-Builders Vanished from the Earth\\", originally in the 1969 edition of American Heritage, collected in the anthology A Sense of History [Houghton-Mifflin, 1985]; available online here .Gordon M. Sayre, \\"The Mound Builders and the Imagination of American Antiquity in Jefferson, Bartram, and Chateaubriand\\", Early American Literature 33 (1998): 225‚Äì249. Mound-building cultures =Archaic era= Illustration of Watson Brake, the oldest mound complex in North America Illustration of Poverty Point in West Carroll Parish, Louisiana Radiocarbon dating has established the age of the earliest Archaic mound complex in southeastern Louisiana. One of the two Monte Sano Site mounds, excavated in 1967 before being destroyed for new construction at Baton Rouge, was dated at 6220 BP (plus or minus 140 years). Researchers at the time thought that such societies were not organizationally capable of this type of construction.Rebecca Saunders, \\"The Case for Archaic Period Mounds in Southeastern Louisiana\\", Southeastern Archaeology, Vol. 13, No. 2, Winter 1994, accessed 4 November 2011 It has since been dated as about 6500 BP, or 4500 BCE, although not all agree.Joe W. Saunders, \\"Middle Archaic and Watson Brake\\", in Archaeology of Louisiana, edited by Mark A. Rees, Ian W. (FRW) Brown, LSU Press, 2010, p. 67 Watson Brake is located in the floodplain of the Ouachita River near Monroe in northern Louisiana. Securely dated to about 5,400 years ago (around 3500 BCE), in the Middle Archaic period, it consists of a formation of 11 mounds from to tall, connected by ridges to form an oval nearly across.Saunders, in Rees and Brown (2010), Archaeology of Louisiana, pp. 69‚Äì76 In the Americas, building of complex earthwork mounds started at an early date, well before the pyramids of Egypt were constructed. Watson Brake was being constructed nearly 2,000 years before the better-known Poverty Point, and building continued for 500 years. Middle Archaic mound construction seems to have ceased about 2800 BCE, and scholars have not ascertained the reason, but it may have been because of changes in river patterns or other environmental factors.Saunders, in Rees and Brown (2010), Archaeology of Louisiana, pp. 73‚Äì74 With the 1990s dating of Watson Brake and similar complexes, scholars established that pre- agricultural, pre-ceramic American societies could organize to accomplish complex construction during extended periods of time, invalidating scholars' traditional ideas of Archaic society.Saunders, in Rees and Brown (2010), Archaeology of Louisiana, p. 63 Watson Brake was built by a hunter-gatherer society, the people of which occupied the area on only a seasonal basis, but where successive generations organized to build the complex mounds over a 500-year period. Their food consisted mostly of fish and deer, as well as available plants. Poverty Point, built about 1500 BCE in what is now Louisiana, is a prominent example of Late Archaic mound-builder construction (around 2500 BCE ‚Äì 1000 BCE). It is a striking complex of more than , where six earthwork crescent ridges were built in concentric arrangement, interrupted by radial aisles. Three mounds are also part of the main complex, and evidence of residences extends for about along the bank of Bayou Macon. It is the major site among 100 associated with the Poverty Point culture and is one of the best-known early examples of earthwork monumental architecture. Unlike the localized societies during the Middle Archaic, this culture showed evidence of a wide trading network outside its area, which is one of its distinguishing characteristics. Horr's Island, Florida, now a gated community next to Marco Island, when excavated by Michael Russo in 1980 found an Archaic Indian village site. Mound A was a burial mound that dated to 3400 BCE, making it the oldest known burial mound in North America.Russo, Brown =Woodland period= Grave Creek Mound, Moundsville, West Virginia, Adena culture The oldest mound associated with the Woodland period was the mortuary mound and pond complex at the Fort Center site in Glade County, Florida. 2012 excavations and dating by Thompson and Pluckhahn show that work began around 2600 BCE, seven centuries before the mound-builders in Ohio. The Archaic period was followed by the Woodland period (circa 1000 BCE). Some well- understood examples are the Adena culture of Ohio, West Virginia, and parts of nearby states. The subsequent Hopewell culture built monuments from present- day Illinois to Ohio; it is renowned for its geometric earthworks. The Adena and Hopewell were not the only mound-building peoples during this time period. Contemporaneous mound-building cultures existed throughout what is now the Eastern United States, stretching as far south as Crystal River in western Florida. During this time, in parts of present-day Mississippi, Arkansas, and Louisiana, the Hopewellian Marksville culture degenerated and was succeeded by the Baytown culture. Reasons for degeneration include attacks from other tribes or the impact of severe climatic changes undermining agriculture. =Coles Creek culture= Illustration of Kings Crossing Site in Warren County, Mississippi The Coles Creek culture is a Late Woodland culture (700-1200 CE) in the Lower Mississippi Valley in the Southern United States that marks a significant change of the cultural history of the area. Population and cultural and political complexity increased, especially by the end of the Coles Creek period. Although many of the classic traits of chiefdom societies were not yet made, by 1000 CE, the formation of simple elite polities had begun. Coles Creek sites are found in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Mississippi, and Texas. The Coles Creek culture is considered ancestral to the Plaquemine culture. =Mississippian cultures= Illustration of Cahokia with the large Monks Mound in the central precinct, encircled by a palisade, surrounded by four plazas, notably the Grand Plaza to the south Around 900‚Äì1450 CE, the Mississippian culture developed and spread through the Eastern United States, primarily along the river valleys. The largest regional center where the Mississippian culture is first definitely developed is located in Illinois near the Mississippi, and is referred to presently as Cahokia. It had several regional variants including the Middle Mississippian culture of Cahokia, the South Appalachian Mississippian variant at Moundville and Etowah, the Plaquemine Mississippian variant in south Louisiana and Mississippi, and the Caddoan Mississippian culture of northwestern Louisiana, eastern Texas, and southwestern Arkansas. Like the mound builders of the Ohio, these people built gigantic mounds as burial and ceremonial places.Nash, Gary B. Red, White and Black: The Peoples of Early North America Los Angeles 2015. Chapter 1, p. 6 =Fort Ancient culture= Artist's conception of the Fort Ancient culture SunWatch Indian Village Fort Ancient is the name for a Native American culture that flourished from 1000 to 1650 CE among a people who predominantly inhabited land along the Ohio River in areas of modern-day southern Ohio, northern Kentucky, and western West Virginia. =Plaquemine culture= Illustration of the Holly Bluff Site in Yazoo County, Mississippi A continuation of the Coles Creek culture in the lower Mississippi River Valley in western Mississippi and eastern Louisiana. Examples include the Medora Site in West Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana; and the Anna and Emerald Mound sites in Mississippi. Sites inhabited by Plaquemine peoples continued to be used as vacant ceremonial centers without large village areas much as their Coles Creek ancestors had done, although their layout began to show influences from Middle Mississippian peoples to the north. The Winterville and Holly Bluff (Lake George) sites in western Mississippi are good examples that exemplify this change of layout, but continuation of site usage. During the Terminal Coles Creek period (1150 to 1250 CE), contact increased with Mississippian cultures centered upriver near St. Louis, Missouri. This resulted in the adaption of new pottery techniques, as well as new ceremonial objects and possibly new social patterns during the Plaquemine period. As more Mississippian culture influences were absorbed, the Plaquemine area as a distinct culture began to shrink after CE 1350. Eventually, the last enclave of purely Plaquemine culture was the Natchez Bluffs area, while the Yazoo Basin and adjacent areas of Louisiana became a hybrid Plaquemine-Mississippian culture. This division was recorded by Europeans when they first arrived in the area. In the Natchez Bluffs area, the Taensa and Natchez people had held out against Mississippian influence and continued to use the same sites as their ancestors, and the Plaquemine culture is considered directly ancestral to these historic period groups encountered by Europeans. Groups who appear to have absorbed more Mississippian influence were identified as those tribes speaking the Tunican, Chitimachan, and Muskogean languages. =Archaeological culture maps= File:Hopewellsphere2 map HRoe 2008.jpgHopewell traditions File:Ohio Arch Cultures map HRoe 2008.jpgAdena culture File:Troyville and Baytown cultures map HRoe 2011.jpgTroyville culture and Baytown culture File:Coles Creek culture map HRoe 2010.jpgColes Creek culture File:Mississippian cultures HRoe 2010.jpgMississippian culture File:Caddoan Mississippian culture map HRoe 2010.jpgCaddoan Mississippian culture File:Fort Ancient Monongahela cultures HRoe 2010.jpgFort Ancient culture File:Plaquemine culture map HRoe 2010.jpgPlaquemine culture Alternative explanations Through the mid-19th century, European Americans did not recognize that ancestors of the Native Americans had built the prehistoric mounds of the eastern U.S. They believed that the massive earthworks and large ceremonial complexes were built by a different people. A New York Times article from 1897 described a mound in Wisconsin in which a giant human skeleton measuring over in length was found. From 1886, another New York Times article described water receding from a mound in Cartersville, Georgia, which uncovered acres of skulls and bones, some of which were said to be gigantic. Two thigh bones were measured with the height of their owners estimated at . President Lincoln made reference to the giants whose bones fill the mounds of America. The antiquarian author William Pidgeon created fraudulent surveys of mound groups that did not exist, possibly tainting this opinion, which was replaced by others.Pidgeon, William (1858) Traditions of Dee-Coo-Dah and Antiquarian Researches. Horace Thayer, New York.Finney, Fred (2008) William Pidgeon and T.H. Lewis. Minnesota Archaeologist 67: 89‚Äì105Birmingham, Robert A. and Leslie E. Eisenberg (2000) Indian Mounds of Wisconsin. University of Wisconsin Press, Madison, Wisconsin, pp. 24‚Äì27. A major factor in increasing public knowledge of the origins of the mounds was the 1894 report by Cyrus Thomas of the Bureau of American Ethnology. He concluded that the prehistoric earthworks of the Eastern United States were the work of early cultures of Native Americans. A small number of people had earlier made similar conclusions: Thomas Jefferson, for example, excavated a mound and from the artifacts and burial practices, noted similarities between mound-builder funeral practices and those of Native Americans in his time. In addition, Theodore Lewis in 1886 had refuted Pidgeon's fraudulent claims of pre-Native American moundbuilders.Lewis, Theodore H. (1886) \\"The 'Monumental Tortoise' Mounds of 'Dee-Coo-Dah'\\" The American Journal of Archaeology 2(1):65‚Äì69. Writers and scholars have proposed many alternative origins for the Mound Builders: ;Vikings In 1787, Benjamin Smith Barton proposed the theory that the Mound Builders were Vikings who came to North America and eventually disappeared. ;Ancient world immigrants Other people believed that Greeks, Africans, Chinese, or assorted Europeans built the mounds. Some Euro-Americans thought the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel had built the mounds. ;Book of Mormon inhabitants During the 19th century, a common belief was that the Jews, particularly the Lost Ten Tribes, were the ancestors of Native Americans and the Mound Builders. The Book of Mormon (published first in 1830) provides a related belief, as its narrative describes two major immigrations to the Americas from Mesopotamia: the Jaredites (3000‚Äì2000 BCE) and an Israelite group in 590 BCE (termed Nephites, Lamanites, and Mulekites). While the Nephites, Lamanites, and Mulekites were all of Jewish origin coming from Israel around 590 BCE, the Jaradites were a non-Abrahamic people separate in all aspects, except in a belief in Jehovah, from the Nephites. The Book of Mormon depicts these settlers building magnificent cities, which were destroyed by warfare about CE 385. Numerous observers have suggested that the Book of Mormon appears to be a work of fiction that parallels others within the 19th-century \\"mound-builder\\" genre that was pervasive at the time...Garlinghouse, Thomas, \\"Revisiting the Mound Builder Controversy\\", History Today, September 2001, Vol. 51, Issue 9, p. 38.Robert Silverberg, Mound Builders of Ancient America: The Archeology of a Myth (New York: New York Graphic Society, 1968); .Curtis Dahl, \\"Mound-Builders, Mormons, and William Cullen Bryant\\", The New England Quarterly, vol. 34, no. 2, June 1961, pp. 178‚Äì90 (\\"Undoubtedly the most famous and certainly the most influential of all Mound-Builder literature is the Book of Mormon (1830)). Whether one wishes to accept it as divinely inspired or the work of Joseph Smith, it fits exactly into the tradition. Despite its pseudo-Biblical style and its general inchoateness, it is certainly the most imaginative and best sustained of the stories about the Mound-Builders\\" (at p. 187).Fawn M. Brodie, No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith (rev. ed., New York: Knopf, 1971) p. 36.

Brown (editor), pg. 26 native North American inscriptions, North American elephant remains etc.) were well-publicized at the time of the publication of the Book of Mormon and there is incorporation of some of these ideas into the narrative. References are made in the Book of Mormon to then-current understanding of pre-Columbian civilizations, including the Formative Mesoamerican civilizations such as the (Pre-Classic) Olmec, Maya, and Zapotec. ;Black civilizations During the 20th century, certain sects affiliated with the Black nationalist Moorish Science philosophy theorized an association with the Mound Builders. They argue that the Mound Builders were an ancient advanced Black civilization that developed the legendary continents of Atlantis and Mu, as well as ancient Egypt and Mesoamerica. These Black groups claim that the American Indians were too primitive to have developed the sophisticated societies and the technology believed necessary to build the mounds. ;Divine creation The Reverend Landon West claimed that Serpent Mound in Ohio was built by God, or by man inspired by him. He believed that God built the mound and placed it as a symbol of the story of the Garden of Eden. ;Mythical cultures Some people attributed the mounds to mythical cultures: Lafcadio Hearn suggested that the mounds were built by people from the lost continent of Atlantis. =Effects of alternative explanations= The mound-builder explanations were often honest misinterpretations of real data from valid sources. Both scholars and laymen accepted some of these explanations. Reference to an alleged race appears in the poem \\"The Prairies\\" (1832) by William Cullen Bryant.Bryant, William Cullen, \\"The Prairies\\" (1832) ;Assumption that construction was too complex for Native Americans One belief was that Native American Indians were too unsophisticated to have constructed such complex earthworks and artifacts. The associated stone, metal, and clay artifacts were thought to be too complex for ancient Native Americans to have made. In the American Southeast and Midwest, numerous Native American cultures were sedentary and used agriculture. Numerous Native American towns had built surrounding stockades for defense. Capable of this type of construction, their ancestors and they could have built mounds, but people who believed that Native Americans did not build the earthworks did not analyze it in this manner. They thought the Native American nomadic cultures would not organize to build such monuments, for failure to devote the time and effort to construct such time-consuming projects. When British colonists first arrived in America, they did not witness the Native Americans building mounds and these colonists reported that few Native Americans (specifically referring to those Native Americans living in this area newly colonized by England) on the Atlantic coast - knew of their own (ancient ?) history when asked. Yet earlier Europeans, especially the Spanish, had written numerous non-English-language accounts about the Indians' construction of mounds. Garcilaso de la Vega reported how the Indians built the mounds and placed temples on top of them. A few French expeditions reported staying with Indian societies who had built mounds also. ;Assumption that construction was older than Native Americans known to European Americans at that time. People also claimed that Native Americans were not the Mound Builders because the mounds and related artifacts were older than Native American cultures known by European Americans at that time. For example, Caleb Atwater's misunderstanding of stratigraphy caused him to believe that the Mound Builders were a much older civilization than known Native Americans. In his book, Antiquities Discovered in the Western States (1820), Atwater claimed that Indian remains were always found right beneath the surface of the earth. Since the artifacts associated with the Mound Builders were found fairly deep in the ground, Atwater argued that they must be from a different group of people. The discovery of metal artifacts further convinced people that the Mound Builders were not Native Americans. This is because the Native Americans encountered by the Europeans and European Americans were not thought to engage in metallurgy. Some artifacts that were found in relation to the mounds were inscribed with symbols. As the Europeans did not know of any Native American cultures that had a writing system, they assumed a different group had created them. Hoaxes Panoramic view from within the Great Circle at the Newark Earthworks in Newark, Ohio (wall of which can be seen in the background) Several hoaxes have involved the Mound Builder cultures. ;Newark Holy Stones :In 1860, David Wyrick discovered the \\"Keystone tablet\\", containing Hebrew language inscriptions written on it, in Newark, Ohio. Soon afterward, he found the \\"Newark Decalogue Stone\\" nearby, also claimed to be inscribed in Hebrew. The authenticity of the \\"Newark Holy Stones\\" and the circumstances of their discovery are disputed. ;Davenport tablets :Reverend Jacob Gass discovered what were called the \\"Davenport tablets\\" in Iowa in the 1870s. These bore inscriptions that later were determined to be fake. ;Walam Olum hoax :The Walam Olum hoax had considerable influence on perceptions of the Mound Builders. In 1836, Constantine Samuel Rafinesque published his translation of a text he claimed had been written in pictographs on wooden tablets. This text explained that the Lenape Indians originated in Asia, told of their passage over the Bering Strait, and narrated their subsequent migration across the North American continent. This \\"Walam Olum\\" tells of battles with native peoples already in America before the Lenape arrived. People hearing of the account believed that the \\"original people\\" were the Mound Builders, and that the Lenape overthrew them and destroyed their culture. David Oestreicher later asserted that Rafinesque's account was a hoax. He argued that the Walam Olum glyphs derived from Chinese, Egyptian, and Mayan alphabets. Meanwhile, the belief that the Native Americans destroyed the mound-builder culture had gained widespread acceptance. ;Kinderhook plates :Another hoax, the \\"Kinderhook plates\\" \\"discovered\\" in 1843, involved material planted by a contemporary in Native American mounds. This hoax aimed to discredit the account of the Mormon prophet Joseph Smith having translated an ancient book.Kimball, Stanley B.

The wilderness is composed of broad plateaus, tall escarpments, and deep canyons. The Paria River flows through the wilderness before joining the Colorado River at Lee's Ferry, Arizona. The U.S. Congress designated the wilderness area in 1984 and it was largely incorporated into the new Vermilion Cliffs National Monument proclaimed in 2000 by executive order of President Bill Clinton. Both the wilderness area and the National Monument are administered by the federal Bureau of Land Management. The Colorado Plateau and its river basins are of immense value in the Earth sciences, specifically chronostratigraphy, as the region contains multiple terrain features exposing miles-thick contiguous rock columns that geologists and paleobiologists use as reference strata of the geologic record.Caputo, M. V. (2003) Geology of the Paria Canyon-Vermilion Cliffs Wilderness, Utah and Arizona. in D.A. Sprinkel, T.C. Chidsey Jr., and P.B. Anderson, eds., Geology of Utah's Parks and Monuments. Utah Geological Association, Salt Lake City, Utah.  Human history  Ancient petroglyphs, granaries, and campsites indicate that ancestral Puebloan people utilized the Wilderness between AD 200 and AD 1200. They hunted mule deer and bighorn sheep and grew corn, beans, and squash in the lower end of the canyon. Paiute people later occupied and traveled much of the area before Europeans arrived. Because no habitations or large villages have been found in the canyon, researchers believe the canyon was primarily used as a travel route. The first documented Europeans in the area were Fathers Francisco Atanasio Dom√≠nguez and Silvestre V√©lez de Escalante of the Dom√≠nguez‚ÄìEscalante expedition. The expedition stopped at the mouth of the Paria River in 1776 after they unsuccessfully attempted to establish a route from Santa Fe, New Mexico, to Monterey, California. The 19th century drew outlaws who hid out in the Wilderness and prospectors who mined gold, uranium, and other minerals.  Wildlife  Cliff swallow nests A variety of wildlife makes its home in the Paria Canyon-Vermilion Cliffs Wilderness. = Birds = Many bird species are found in the Wilderness, including bald eagle, golden eagle, peregrine falcon, red-tailed hawk, great horned owl, and Cooper's hawk. Other birds seen in the Wilderness include white-throated swift, violet-green swallow, rock wren, canyon wren, killdeer, cliff swallow, black-throated sparrow, ruby-crowned kinglet, blue-gray gnatcatcher, black-chinned hummingbird, great blue heron, flycatchers and various species of duck. The Wilderness was the location of a 1996 release of captively-bred endangered California condors in an attempt to re-introduce them to the wild. Desert bighorn sheep = Mammals = Mammals found in the Wilderness include mule deer, bobcat, fox, mountain lion, porcupine, beaver, coyote, jack rabbit, cottontail rabbit, ground squirrels, kangaroo rat, and various other rodent species. Desert bighorn sheep were successfully reintroduced to Paria Canyon in the 1980s and are usually found in the cliffs and crags of the lower canyon. = Reptiles and amphibians = A variety of reptiles live in the Wilderness, including rattlesnake, chuckwalla, side- blotched lizard, leopard lizard, desert spiny lizard, and collared lizard. The red-spotted toad can be spotted in the canyon and four species of fish are occasionally found in the Paria River - the flannel mouth sucker, bluehead sucker, razorback sucker, and speckled dace.  Vegetation  Seep willow (Baccharis salicifolia) Vegetation in the Paria Canyon-Vermilion Cliffs Wilderness can be divided into three different zones of riparian vegetation communities, which run parallel to each side of the river. Plants found closest to the water include cattails, common reeds, sedges, rushes, and horsetails. Drier soil farther from the water makes a good environment for woody vegetation which has survived the repeated flooding, such as coyote willow, cottonwood, ash, tamarisk, and seep-willow. This zone is referred to as the \\"regeneration site\\" because some of the trees that grow here survive to produce the next generation of mature canopy. Beyond the regeneration site trees grow strong and tall. Dominant vegetation includes cottonwood, willow, ash, and tamarisk. This zone is the fringe between riparian and desert uplands, often sharing vegetation like rabbitbrush, Indian ricegrass, arrowweed, and sand dropseed. Other vegetation found in the Wilderness include pinyon pine, juniper, boxelder, various species of cactus, and other desert flora.  Recreation  The Wave formation in Coyote Buttes Hiking is the most common recreational activity in the Paria Canyon-Vermilion Cliffs Wilderness, followed by camping, photography, and canyoneering. Hikes through Paria Canyon are popular. The White House Trailhead is the main entrance and, therefore, more popular than the other trailheads in the Wilderness. Wire Pass Trailhead is the starting point for hiking into the canyon via Buckskin Gulch, as well as to spectacular sandstone formations such as The Wave on the slopes of the Coyote Buttes. The BLM has placed a limit on overnight camping in the Paria Canyon portion of the Wilderness in order to protect it from overuse. It is also necessary to obtain a permit for the popular hike to the Wave formation in Coyote Buttes.

Shakryl was a senior associate at the Institute for the Study of the Humanities at the Abkhazian Academy of Sciences. She was a strong supporter of Abkhaz independence, and had been sharply critical of major powers and international organizations for demanding that Abkhazia remain a province of Georgia. in January 1991, Skakryl became a founding member of the Democratic Party of Abkhazia, Abkhazia's first, but short-lived, post-Soviet political party. Death Shakryl was a prominent supporter of presidential candidate Raul Khadjimba. On 12 November 2004, she was among the supporters of Khadjimba who tried to resist the crowd of Khadjimba's rival candidate Sergei Bagapsh's supporters who stormed the parliament building as a drawn-out crisis over rigged elections neared its end. Reports of her death vary: some have claimed that guards fired into the air, others that Shakryl was hit by a ricochet. In any case, she was shot, and died in hospital later that day, at the age of 78. Aftermath Shakryl's death caused outrage and marked a significant turning point in the political crisis. After her death, Bagapsh changed tactics, urging his supporters to leave the parliament building, but then to remain outside, in a similar tactic to that used successfully in the Orange Revolution in Ukraine several weeks later. Bagapsh's supporters then detained two presidential guards over Shakryl's death, and brought them to the prosecutor's office. Security forces loyal to outgoing president Vladislav Ardzinba (Khadjimba's mentor) subsequently launched a raid on the prosecutor's office and freed the two men. However, this only exacerbated tension, and resulted in the decision of 2,000 police members to refuse to follow government orders. In many ways as a result of this crisis, Khadjimba backed down several weeks later, agreeing to run as Bagapsh's deputy in a re-vote. In January 2006, when the Abkhazian passport was introduced, Shakryl posthumously received the second passport to be issued, after Vladislav Ardzinba.

He was assassinated in Attalla, Alabama, during a protest march from Chattanooga, Tennessee to Jackson, Mississippi, where he intended to deliver a letter to Governor Ross Barnett, supporting civil rights. Early life Moore was born in Binghamton, New York and raised in New York and Mississippi. For a time before his death he lived in Baltimore, Maryland. In the early 1950s, when Moore was a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University, he suffered a mental breakdown. He was institutionalized for a year and a half with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. After being released, he became an activist on behalf of the mentally ill. He gradually got involved in civil rights activism for African Americans. Moore joined the Congress on Racial Equality (CORE). In the early 1960s, Moore undertook three civil rights protests in which he marched to a capital to hand-deliver letters he had written denouncing racial segregation. On his first march he walked to Annapolis, Maryland, the state capital. On his second march he walked to the White House. He arrived at about the same time that Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was being released from the Birmingham jail after protests in that city. His letter to President John F. Kennedy said that he intended to walk to Mississippi and \\"If I may deliver any letters from you to those on my line of travel, I would be most happy to do so.\\" For his third protest he planned to walk from Chattanooga, Tennessee to Jackson, Mississippi and deliver a letter to Governor Ross Barnett urging him to accept integration. He was wearing sandwich board signs stating; \\"Equal rights for all & Mississippi or Bust\\". On April 23, 1963, about into his march, Moore was interviewed by Charlie Hicks, a reporter from radio station WGAD in Gadsden, Alabama, along a rural stretch of U.S. Highway 11 near Attalla. The station had received an anonymous phone tip about Moore's location. In the interview, Moore said: \\"I intend to walk right up to the governor's mansion in Mississippi and ring his doorbell. Then I'll hand him my letter.\\" Concerned for Moore's safety, Hicks offered to drive him to a motel. Moore insisted on continuing his march. Less than an hour after the reporter left the scene, a passing motorist found Moore's body about a mile farther down the road, shot twice in the head at close range with a .22 caliber rifle. The gun's ownership was traced to Floyd Simpson (a white man), whom Moore had argued with earlier that day, but no charges were ever filed against him. Moore died a week short of his 36th birthday. Moore's letter was found and opened. In it, Moore reasoned that \\"the white man cannot be truly free himself until all men have their rights.\\" He asked Governor Barnett to: \\"Be gracious and give more than is immediately demanded of you....\\" Folk singer Phil Ochs wrote a song in tribute to William Moore that is part of the posthumously released 1986 album, A Toast to Those Who Are Gone.Lyrics of \\"William Moore\\" by Phil OchsAudio recording of \\"William Moore\\" by Phil Ochs Another tribute song (in German) for William Moore was written by East German singer/songwriter Wolf Biermann.Manfred Krug and the Jazz Optimisten Berlin perform Wolf Biermann's Ballad of William L.

A pioneer in civil rights, Moore is the only white person featured in Investigation Discovery's Injustice Files in 2011.\\"Injustice Files: The Murder of William Lewis Moore\\", (Investigation Discovery website) Historical Marker A ceremony unveiling a historic marker was held on Sunday, April 14, 2019 at the site of the murder. The Alabama Historical Society makes placement of such markers possible, but someone else has to pay for them. As the effort went forward, the Southern Poverty Law Center offered to pay the cost of the marker, estimated to be about $3,000. But Jerry Smith, Danny Crownover and Marissa Cannon, local Etowah County historians, believed the money should come locally, to mark this tragic day in local history. Cannon was preparing to do some fundraising in the Attalla area when Smith got in contact with County Commissioner Johnny Grant. Grant arranged for Smith to speak to the commission, and members committed to giving money from their discretionary funds to pay for the marker.

Until his death at the age of 102, Rav Elyashiv was the paramount leader of both Israel and the Diaspora Lithuanian-Haredi community, and many Ashkenazi Jews regarded him as the posek ha-dor, the contemporary leading authority on halakha, or Jewish law. He spent most of his days engaged in Talmudical study, and delivered lectures in Talmud and Shulkhan Arukh at a local synagogue in the Meah Shearim area in Jerusalem where he lived. He received supplicants from all over the world, and answered the most complex Halakhic inquiries. Biography Rav Elyashiv was the son of Rav Avraham Elyashiv (Erener) of Gomel, Belarus, and Chaya Musha, daughter of the kabbalist Rav Shlomo Elyashiv (died 1925) of ≈†iauliai, Lithuania. Born in 1910 at ≈†iauliai, Yosef Shalom Elyashiv arrived with his parents in Mandatory Palestine in 1922, aged 12. He was an only child, born to his parents after 17 years of marriage. At the suggestion of Chief Rabbi of Palestine, Rav Abraham Isaac Kook, Yosef Shalom married Sheina Chaya (died 19 June 1994), a daughter of Rav Aryeh Levin. Rav Kook also conducted the wedding. The couple had five sons and seven daughters. Six of their daughters married significant Rabbinic figures. During Rav Elyashiv's lifetime, six of his children died. Two died in their youth: a son who died of illness as a child, and a daughter killed by Jordanian shelling in 1948. Four other children died over the course of his lifetime. At the time of his death, he had approximately 1,400 descendants, including two sixth-generation descendants. He had seen the beginning of a sixth generation in 2009, when a grandson was born to one of his great-grandchildren. Death In February 2012, the 101-year-old Rav was admitted into the cardiac intensive care unit of the Jesselson Heart Center at the Shaare Zedek Medical Center under the supervision of cardiology branch head Dan Tzivoni and his personal physician. He was admitted due to an acute condition of edema of the lungs and congestion in the heart. He died on 18 July 2012, aged 102, and was buried on Har HaMenuchot after a late-night funeral procession that attracted an estimated 250,000 people. Spiritual and political leader In contrast to his later positions vis a vis the State of Israel, Rav Elyashiv began his Rabbinic career as a judge in the government's religious court system, and was a prot√©g√© of Israel's Ashkenazi chief rabbi, Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog. In the early 1970s, he left the state court system. In 1989, upon the establishment of the religious political party Degel HaTorah, its spiritual leader Rav Elazar Shach asked Rav Elyashiv to join in the public leadership, and he acceded to his request. He came to the major public gatherings of Degel HaTorah, currently part of the umbrella United Torah Judaism list in the Israeli Knesset (parliament), and shared in the task of rendering decisions.House of Nobility, Humble Abode: Rav Elyashiv and His Torah Dynasty by Nosson Weiss. Mishpacha Magazine Issue 159 May 23, 2007 While Rav Elyashiv held no official title, neither as head of a congregation, yeshiva, or particular community, after the death of Rav Shach he took his position and held great influence over the policies of the party, which abided by all his rulings and instructions. Most rosh yeshivas (\\"yeshiva deans\\") associated with the Agudath Israel of America movement frequently sought out his opinions and followed his advice and guidelines concerning a wide array of policy and communal issues affecting the welfare of Orthodox Judaism. Time referred to Rav Elyashiv as the predecessor of Rav Aharon Leib Shteinman as Gadol Hador (\\"leader of the generation\\"). Yossi Elituv, editor of the influential ultra-Orthodox paper Mishpacha, remarked: \\"Rav Elyashiv will be remembered as the ultimate assiduous yeshiva scholar of the 20th and early 21st centuries. He was not seen as a political leader or as the head of group or party. He was a man who made Torah study his entire life, and this will remain an inspiration.\\" Published works The Halakhic rulings and sermonic insights of Rav Elyashiv have been recorded in several books. The 4 volume Kovetz Teshuvos ElyashivVolume 4 was published posthumously contains responsa resulting from questions asked of him over many years. Many of his ethical and sermonic comments on the Torah, most dating from the 1950s, were collected and published as Divrei Aggadah. A Haggadah for Pesach including his comments and Halachic rulings was recently printed. Another work that includes his Halakhic rulings is titled \\"Yashiv Moshe\\". His Talmudic insights were printed in the 18 volume series of Haoros and more recently Shiurei Maran Hagrish Elyashiv on Tractate Berachot and the following books: \\"Pniney Tefila\\"' \\"Pniney Chanuka\\" and \\"Pniney Nisuin\\". These works were not written by Rav Elyashiv, but compiled by his relatives and students; the \\"Pniney\\" series was published by Rabbi Bentzion Kook.

It was also well known for the name Bendix, as used on home clothes washing machines, but never actually made these appliances. History =Early history= Founder and inventor Vincent Bendix initially began his corporation in a hotel room in Chicago in 1914 with an agreement with the struggling bicycle brake manufacturing firm, Eclipse Machine Company of Elmira, New York. Bendix granted permission to his invention which was described as \\"a New York device for the starting of explosive motors.\\" This company made a low cost triple thread screw which could be used in the manufacture of other drive parts. By using this screw with the Eclipse Machine Company, Bendix had a good foundation for his future business plans. Automotive General Motors Corp. purchased a 24% interest in Bendix in 1924, not to operate Bendix but to maintain a direct and continuing contact with developments in aviation, as the engineering techniques of the auto and aircraft were quite similar then. Bendix in the 1920s owned and controlled many important patents for devices applicable to the auto industry, for example, brakes, carburetors, and starting drives for engines. It acquired Bragg-Kliesrath brakes in the late 1920s. In 1942 Ernest Breech became president of Bendix, moving from General Motors Corp., and after performing brilliantly for Bendix by introducing GM management philosophies he then attracted the attention of Henry Ford II who induced him over to Ford Motor Corp. where he finished his career. By 1940 Bendix had sales running around $40 million, and in 1948 General Motors sold its interest in Bendix as it wanted to focus on its expanding automotive operations. Bendix was formally founded in 1924 in South Bend, Indiana, United States. At first it manufactured brake systems for cars and trucks, supplying General Motors and other automobile manufacturers. Bendix manufactured both hydraulic brake systems and a vacuum booster TreadleVac for its production lines for decades. In 1924 Vincent Bendix had acquired the rights to Henri Perrot's patents for drum and shoe design. In 1956, Bendix introduced \\"Electrojector\\", a true multipoint electronic fuel injection system, which was optional on several 1958 models of automobiles built by Chrysler Corporation.Bendix Electrojector Brochure, dated 12-56, Title: \\"Electronic Fuel Injection For Passenger Cars\\"The News-Palladium, Title: \\"Fuel Injection For Cars Built By Bendix\\", September 19, 1956, page7Chicago Daily Tribune, Title: \\"New Chrysler Fuel System Is Introduced\\", September 29, 1957, Page A9 In the 1960s, Bendix automotive brakes blossomed with the introduction of fixed-caliper disc brakes and the \\"Duo-Servo\\" system (which became, virtually, a de facto world standard for drum brakes). During the 1960s, Bendix also dabbled in bicycle hardware, producing a reliable, totally self-contained, 2-speed \\"Kick-Back\\" planetary rear axle with coaster braking. Bendix RIM-8 Talos Starting in the 1950s or before, Bendix Pacific designed, tested, and manufactured hydraulic components and systems, primarily for the military. In the same facility avionics and other electronic hardware was designed, manufactured, and documented in technical manuals. Much of this operation was relocated to a new facility in Sylmar, CA where they had a large deep indoor pool for testing sonar. Telemetry components for the RIM-8 Talos surface-to- air missile included transmitters and oscillators in various frequency bands; the missile itself was designed and built by Bendix. They built and installed the telemetry system in all the ground stations for the first manned space flights. For this program, they developed the first cardio tachometer and respiration rate monitor system so that a ground-based physician could observe an astronaut's vital signs. MK46 torpedo electronics also came from this facility. Other diverse products included radar detectors in aircraft that identified ground missile tracking and ground missile launch at the aircraft. In the 1960s they produced an anti-lock brake system for military aircraft using established technology similar to Dunlop's earlier Maxaret. The technology is similar to the notched wheel and reluctor now used in cars. Bendix Scintilla manufactured MIL SPEC electrical connectors of many styles. Criteria was met for hostile and non-hostile environments that provided seals against liquids and gasses. In 1971, Bendix introduced the world's first true computerized ABS (anti-lock) system on Chrysler's 1971 Imperial. Production continued for several years. Under its present ownership by Honeywell, Bendix continues to manufacture automotive brakes and industrial brakes for a wide variety of industries. In 2014, Honeywell sold the Bendix trademark for automotive brakes in the US to MAT Holdings. Many Bendix automotive, truck and industrial brakes sold in the United States were using asbestos as late as 1987.Independent Laboratory testing of Bendix brakes purchased in 1987 Bendix's current parent, Honeywell, continues to deal with numerous lawsuits brought as a result of asbestos-containing Bendix brand brakes.Lehman Brothers study relating to asbestos liabilities of numerous companies, including Honeywell on page 9 In February 2020, Bendix announced that it's moving its headquarters from Elyria, Ohio to Avon. The new facility should open in November 2021. Mass spectrometer Bendix MA-2 Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer A collaboration between Fred McLafferty and Roland Gohlke and William C. Wiley and Daniel B. Harrington of Bendix Aviation in the 1950s led to the combination of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, and the development of Gas chromatography‚Äìmass spectrometry instrumentation. Beginning in the 1960s, Bendix produced scientific instruments such as the Bendix MA-2 Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer. Avionics, military and government In 1929 Vincent Bendix branched out into aeronautics and renamed the company \\"Bendix Aviation\\" to reflect the new product lines. Bendix supplied aircraft manufacturers with all types of hydraulic systems, for braking and flap activation, and introduced new devices such as a pressure carburetor which dominated the market during World War II. It also made a wide variety of electrical and electronic instruments for aircraft. The Bendix Corporation sponsored the famous Bendix continental air race which started in 1931, and is known for the Bendix Trophy. The competition was a transcontinental U.S. point-to-point race meant to encourage the development of durable, efficient aircraft for commercial aviation. Civilians were barred from the race in 1950. The last race took place in 1962. During World War II Bendix made nearly every ancillary instrument or equipment for military aircraft. The Bendix radio division was established in 1937 to make radio transmitter/receivers for aircraft and other types of avionics. During the war Bendix manufactured about 75% of all avionics in US aircraft. During and after the war Bendix made radar equipment of various types. In the 1950s, Bendix and its successors managed United States Atomic Energy Commission facilities in Kansas City, Missouri and Albuquerque, New Mexico. These facilities procured non-nuclear components for nuclear weapons. A Bendix G-15 computer In 1956, the computer division of Bendix Aviation introduced the Bendix G-15, a mini computer which was the size of two tall filing cabinets. The company sold about 400 of these at prices starting at below US$50,000. The Bendix computer division was taken over in 1963 by Control Data Corporation, which continued to support the G-15 for a few years. The chief designer of the G-15 was Harry Huskey, who had worked with Alan Turing on the ACE in the UK and on the SWAC in the 1950s. Huskey created most of the design while working as a professor at Berkeley and other universities, and also as a consultant. During the 1960s the company made ground and airborne telecommunications systems for NASA. It also built the ST-124-M3 inertial platform used in the Saturn V Instrument Unit which was built by the Navigation and Control Division in Teterboro, NJ. It also developed the first automobile fuel injection system in the US. In January 1963, the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) released a report stating that the \\"most likely abnormality\\" to have caused the crash of American Airlines Flight 1 on March 1, 1962 was a short circuit caused by wires in the automatic piloting system that had been damaged in the manufacturing process. CAB inspectors had inspected units at a Teterboro, New Jersey, Bendix Corporation plant and discovered workers using tweezers to bind up bundles of wires, thus damaging them. The Bendix Corporation issued denials, stating that the units underwent 61 inspections during manufacture, in addition to inspections during installation and maintenance work, and insisted that had the insulation on the wires been breached at some point, it would have been detected and the unit replaced. In 1966 NASA selected Bendix Aerospace Systems Division in Ann Arbor, Michigan to design, manufacture, test, and provide operational support for packages of the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP) to fly on the Apollo Program. Bendix made the fuel system for the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird. Marine During World War II, Bendix was contracted to make engine order telegraphs for the U.S. Navy. Washing machines Although popularly connected to washing machines, the Bendix Corporation itself never manufactured them. In 1936, the company licensed its name to Bendix Home Appliances, another South Bend company, for a 25% stake in the company. In 1937, Bendix Home Appliances, Inc was the first company to market a domestic automatic washing machine. Although sales were initially slow, the benefits of an automatic machine soon began to spread by word-of-mouth. Sales started to climb, so that by the time the USA entered World War II, a total of 330,000 units had been sold. In common with other washing machine manufacturers, production ceased during the war, but resumed in 1946. Total sales reached 2,000,000 by 1950. The 1937 Bendix Home Laundry would be recognised as a front-loading automatic washer by any modern user of such machines. It had a glass porthole door, a rotating drum and an electrically driven mechanical timer. The machine was able to autofill, wash, rinse and spin-dry. Initially the lack of any vibration damper meant that the machine had to be secured firmly to the floor. The machine also lacked an internal water heater. Bendix Home Appliances, founded by Judson Sayre, was later sold to Avco Manufacturing Corporation. In 1956, Avco sold Bendix Home Appliances to Philco. Home electronics Bendix home television Bendix first manufactured domestic radios and phonographs for the retail market after WWII as an outgrowth of its production of aircraft radios. In 1948 Bendix started to sell car radios directly to Ford and other auto manufacturers. From 1950 to 1959, Bendix made television sets. Production of radios for the retail trade grew quickly in the 1950s, but stopped quickly in the 1960s when Ford, GM and Chrysler started producing their own radios. Mergers In the decades between 1970 and 1990, Bendix went through a series of mergers, sales and changes with partners or buyers including Raytheon, Allied Signal and others. This diluted its corporate identity, though for some years these companies used the Bendix brand for some of their products, such as aircraft flight control systems. In 1982 Bendix launched a hostile takeover bid of Martin Marietta. Bendix bought the majority of Martin Marietta shares and in effect owned the company. However, Martin Marietta's management used the short time between ownership and control to sell non-core businesses and launch its own hostile takeover of Bendix‚Äîthe Pac-Man Defense. Industrial conglomerate United Technologies joined the fray, supporting Martin Marietta in their counter-takeover bid. In the end, Bendix was rescued by Allied Corporation, acting as a white knight. Bendix was acquired by Allied in 1983 for US$85 per share. Allied Corporation, later named AlliedSignal, later bought Honeywell and adopted the Honeywell name, and Bendix became a Honeywell brand, including the Bendix/King brand of avionics. Honeywell's Transportation Systems division also carries the Bendix line of brake shoes, pads and other vacuum or hydraulic subsystems. In 2002 Knorr-Bremse took over the commercial vehicle brake business from Honeywell International Inc., USA its share of joint ventures in Europe, Brazil and the USA. Bendix Commercial Vehicle Systems became a subsidiary of Knorr-Bremse AG. The Knorr-Bremse Group achieved sales of EUR 2.1 billion for the first time. Advertising In the 1960s and 1970s, Archie Comics ran comic-strip ads for Bendix brakes for bicycles featuring Archie Andrews and his friends.\\"Archie Gets All the Brakes\\" (Comic Ads #53), ComicVineBicycle Museum of America, Flickr Hive Mind\\"Comic Books Uncovered,\\" Garage Sale Finds, August 19, 2015  See also  * Bendix drive * Ernest L.

A British force under Major General Isaac Brock with Native American allies under Shawnee leader Tecumseh used bluff and deception to intimidate U.S. Brigadier General William Hull into surrendering the fort and town of Detroit, Michigan, along with his dispirited army which actually outnumbered the victorious British and Indians. The British victory reinvigorated the militia and civil authorities of Upper Canada, who had previously been pessimistic and affected by pro-U.S. agitators. Many Indians in the Northwest Territory were inspired to take arms against U.S. outposts and settlers. The British held Detroit for more than a year before their small fleet was defeated on Lake Erie, which forced them to abandon the western frontier of Upper Canada. Background =American plans and moves= U.S. forces during the siege of Detroit were commanded by Brig. Gen. William Hull, an aging veteran of the American Revolutionary War. Tension was increasing between the United Kingdom and the United States in the early months of 1812. Michigan Territory Governor William Hull urged President James Madison and Secretary of War William Eustis to form an army which would secure the Northwest Territory against Indians who were being incited by British agents and fur trading companies to take up arms against the United States. It was urgently necessary to reinforce the outpost of Detroit, which had a population of 800 and a garrison of 120 soldiers.Elting, p. 24 It was also suggested that this army might invade the western districts of Upper Canada, where support might be expected from the many recent immigrants from the United States who had been attracted by generous land grants.Elting, p. 25 Madison and Eustis concurred with this plan and offered command of the army to Hull, an aging veteran of the American Revolutionary War. He was reluctant to take the appointment, but no other officer was available with his prestige and experience. He accepted after repeated pleas from Madison and was commissioned as a brigadier general in the United States Army.Elting, pp. 24‚Äì25 His army consisted of three regiments of Ohio militia under Colonels Lewis Cass, Duncan McArthur, and James Findlay. Hull took command of them at Dayton, Ohio on 25 May but found that they were badly equipped and ill-disciplined, and no arrangements had been made to supply them on the march. He made hasty efforts to remedy the deficiencies in equipment. The army marched north from Urbana, Ohio on 10 June, joined by the 4th U.S. Infantry under Lieutenant Colonel James Miller. Hull ignored an earlier route established by Anthony Wayne and created a new route to Detroit across the Great Black Swamp area of northwest Ohio.Elting, pp. 24‚Äì26 He received a letter from Eustis on 26 June that was dated 18 June, warning him that war was imminent and urging that he should make for Detroit \\"with all possible expedition\\",Elting, p. 26 so he hastened his march. His draft horses were worn out by the arduous march, so he put his entrenching tools, medical supplies, officers' baggage, despatches, some sick men and the army's band aboard the packet vessel Cayahoga at the foot of the Maumee River, to be transported across Lake Erie. Eustis had sent his first letter of 18 June by special messenger. Congress had passed the declaration of war later that day, but Eustis sent a letter with this vital information only by ordinary mail.Elting, p. 27 On 28 June, the postmaster at Cleveland, Ohio hired an express rider to rush the letter to Hull but even this arrived only on 2 July. The British ambassador in Washington had sent the news urgently to Britain and Canada, and the military commanders in Canada had, in turn, hastened to inform all their outposts of the state of war. On 2 July, the unsuspecting Cayahoga was captured by , a Canadian-manned armed brig of the Provincial Marine, under the command of Lieutenant Fr√©d√©ric Rolette, near the British post at Amherstburg, Ontario at the foot of the Detroit River. Hull reached Detroit on 5 July, where he was reinforced by detachments of Michigan militia, including the 140 men of the Michigan Legionary Corps, which Hull had established in 1805. The American army was short of supplies, especially food, as Detroit provided only soap and whiskey. Nevertheless, Eustis urged Hull to attack Amherstburg. The fort there was defended by 300 British regulars, mainly from the 41st Regiment of Foot, 400 Indians, and some, principally Essex, militia. The post's commander was Colonel St. George, who was later superseded by Colonel Henry Procter of the 41st. Hull was not enthusiastic and wrote to Eustis that \\"the British command the water and the savages.\\"Hitsman, p. 70 Nevertheless, his army crossed into Canada on 12 July. He issued several proclamations which were intended to induce Canadians to join or support his army while some of his mounted troops raided up the Thames River as far as Moraviantown. These moves discouraged many of the militia from opposing his invasion, but few of the inhabitants of the region actively aided him, even those who had recently moved from the United States.Hitsman, p.67 There were several indecisive skirmishes with British outposts along the Canard River. Hull decided that he could not attack the British fort without artillery, which could not be brought forward because the carriages had decayed and needed repair, and fell back.Hitsman, pp. 71‚Äì72 Several of his officers disagreed with this retreat and secretly discussed removing him from command. Hull had been quarreling with his militia colonels since taking over the army, and he felt that he did not have their support in the field or in their councils of war. =British moves= Plan of Detroit and its fort, 1792 On 17 July, a mixed force of British regulars, Canadian fur traders, and Indians captured the important trading post of Mackinac Island on Lake Huron from its small American garrison who were not aware that war had been declared. Many of the Indians who had taken part in the attack either remained at Mackinac or returned to their homes, but 100 or more Sioux, Menominee, and Winnebago warriors began moving south from Mackinac to join those already at Amherstburg, while the news induced the previously neutral Wyandots living near Detroit to become increasingly hostile to the Americans. Hull learned of the capture of Mackinac on 3 August, when the paroled American garrison reached Detroit by schooner.Hitsman, p.75 He feared that this had \\"opened the northern hive of Indians\\"C. P. Stacey, The Defence of Upper Canada, 1812, in Zaslow (ed), p.18 and so abandoned all the Canadian territory that he held. Hull's supply lines ran for along the Detroit River and the shore of Lake Erie, which was dominated by the British armed vessels, making them vulnerable to British and Indian raiders. A raiding party under Tecumseh ambushed and routed an American detachment under Major van Horne on 4 August at the Battle of Brownstown, capturing more of Hull's despatches. Hull sent a larger party under James Miller to clear his lines of communication and escort a supply convoy of 300 head of cattle and 70 pack horses loaded with flour, which was waiting at Frenchtown, Michigan under Major Brush.Elting, p.30 Miller forced a British and Indian force under Major Adam Muir of the 41st Regiment to retreat some distance at the Battle of Maguaga on 9 August, but the British re-formed their line and he declined to resume the attack. Miller was ill and his losses in the engagement were heavier than those of the enemy, and he lost confidence and remained encamped near the battlefield until Hull ordered him to return to Detroit. Major General Isaac Brock met with Shawnee chief Tecumseh in Amherstburg, Ontario and quickly established a rapport, ensuring that he would cooperate with his movements. Meanwhile, British Major General Isaac Brock was in York, the provincial capital, dealing with the unwilling Legislative Assembly and mobilizing the province's militia. He had only a single regiment of regulars and some small detachments of veterans and artillery to support the militia, but he was aware that there was no immediate threat from the disorganized and badly supplied American forces on the Niagara River, or from the lethargic American commander in chief, Major General Henry Dearborn at Albany, New York. Hull's army alone was occupying or threatening Canadian territory. Late in July, Brock learned of the capture of Mackinac. He was also informed by Lieutenant General George Prevost, the Governor General of Canada, that an additional regiment was being dispatched to Upper Canada, although as piecemeal detachments. Brock dispatched 50 of his small force of regulars and 250 volunteers from the militia westward from York to reinforce Amherstburg. On 5 August, he prorogued the assembly and set out himself after them. He and his force sailed from Port Dover, Ontario in batteaux and open boats. They reached Amherstburg on 13 August,C. P. Stacey, The Defence of Upper Canada, 1812, in Zaslow (ed), p.17 at the same time as 200 additional Indian warriors who joined Tecumseh (100 \\"Western Indians\\" from Mackinac and 100 Wyandots). At Amherstburg, Brock learned from Hull's captured despatches that the morale was low in Hull's army, that they feared the numbers of Indians which might be facing them, and that they were short of supplies. Brock also established a rapport with Tecumseh, ensuring that the Indians would cooperate with his moves. Brock and Tecumseh met shortly after Brock arrived at Amherstburg, and legend has it that Tecumseh turned to his warriors and said, \\"Here is a man!\\" Brock wrote shortly afterwards, \\"a more sagacious and a more gallant Warrior does not I believe exist.\\"Hitsman, p.78 Brock determined on an immediate attack on Detroit, against the advice of most of his subordinates. The British had already played on Hull's fear of the Indians by arranging for a misleading letter to fall into American hands. The letter asked that no more Indians be allowed to proceed from Fort Mackinac, as there were already 5,000 at Amherstburg and supplies were running short. Brock sent Hull a demand for surrender, stating: > The force at my disposal authorizes me to require of you the immediate > surrender of Fort Detroit. It is far from my intention to join in a war of > extermination, but you must be aware, that the numerous body of Indians who > have attached themselves to my troops, will be beyond control the moment the > contest commences. According to Brock's later report, the attacking force included 600 warriors and 1300 soldiers, as well as two warships. Brock's force carried out several bluffs to deceive the Americans into believing that there were more Indians and troops than there actually were. Major Thomas Evans at Fort George suggested that Brock give his militia the cast-off uniforms of the 41st Regiment to make Hull believe that most of the British force were regulars.Cruikshank, p.186 The troops were told to light individual fires instead of one fire per unit, thereby creating the illusion of a much larger army. They marched to take up positions in plain sight of the Americans then quickly ducked behind entrenchments, and marched back out of sight to repeat the maneuver. The same trick was carried out during meals, where the line would dump their beans into a hidden pot, then return out of view to rejoin the end of the line. Battle The Francois B√¢by house, in the grounds of which the British set up their battery to fire on the American fort On 15 August, gunners of the Provincial Marine set up a battery of one 18-pounder and two 12-pounder guns and two mortars on the Canadian shore of the Detroit River (in the grounds of the Francois B√¢by House, formerly Hull's headquarters) and began bombarding Fort Detroit, joined by the armed vessel General Hunter and the 20-gun sloop-of-war . In the early hours of the morning of 16 August, Tecumseh's warriors crossed the river about south of Detroit.Elting, pp.34‚Äì35 They were followed after daybreak by Brock's force, divided into three small \\"brigades\\". The first was composed of 50 men of the Royal Newfoundland Fencibles and some Lincoln and Kent militia; the second consisted of 50 men of the 41st Regiment with York, Lincoln, Oxford and Norfolk militia; the third was formed from the main body of the 41st (200 men) and 50 men of the Royal Artillery with five field guns (three 6-pounders and two 3-pounders). Elements of the Essex militia, which had been disheartened in the face of Hull's initial advance into Upper Canada, also constituted part of Brock's reinvigorated force. / Brock originally intended to occupy a fortified position astride Hull's supply line and wait for starvation and bombardment to force the Americans to surrender or come out to fight, but he then learned that Hull had sent a detachment of 400 men the previous day under Colonels Cass and McArthur to escort Brush's convoy to Detroit via a backwoods trail some distance from the lake and river,Elting (1995), p.32 and this detachment was only a few miles from the British rear. (Hull had sent messengers recalling this force the night before, but Cass and MacArthur had already encamped for the night and declined to move.) To avoid being caught between two fires, Brock advanced immediately against the rear of Fort Detroit, the side farthest from the river where the defences were weakest. Tecumseh's warriors, meanwhile, paraded several times past a gap in the forest where the Americans could see them, while making loud war cries. Militia cavalry leader William Hamilton Merritt noted that \\"Tecumseh extended his men, and marched them three times through an opening in the woods at the rear of the fort in full view of the garrison, which induced them to believe there were at least two or three thousand Indians.\\"Merritt, in Wood, William ed. Select British Documents of the Canadian War of 1812. British documents, 3:554.) Merritt was not an eyewitness, however, and this claim has been disputed. As the British prepared to attack, a shell exploded in the officers' mess inside the fort, causing casualties. Hull despaired of holding out against a force which seemingly consisted of thousands of British regulars, because he was lacking adequate gunpowder and ammunition to withstand a long siege. A surrender would also save his 2,500 soldiers and 700 civilians, including his own daughter, from \\"the horrors of an Indian massacre\\", he wrote. Hull hoisted a white flag of surrender against the advice of his subordinates. He sent messengers to Brock asking for three days to agree on terms of surrender. Brock replied that he would allow him three hours. Hull surrendered his entire force, including Cass's and McArthur's detachment and Major Brush's supply convoy. There were rumours that he had been drinking heavily prior to the surrender. He is reported to have said that the Indians were \\"numerous beyond example\\" and \\"more greedy of violence‚Ä¶ than the Vikings or Huns.\\" Casualties and losses USS Adams shortly after she was captured by British forces during the siege of Detroit The British bombardment killed seven Americans before the surrender, including Lieutenant Porter Hanks, the former commander of Fort Mackinac who was awaiting a court-martial. The answering fire from the guns of Fort Detroit wounded two British gunners. After Hull surrendered, the 1,600 Ohio militiamen from his army were paroled and escorted south until they were out of danger of attack from the Indians. Most of the Michigan militia had already deserted. The 582 American regulars were sent as prisoners to Quebec City. Among the booty and military stores surrendered were 33 cannon, 300 rifles, 2,500 muskets, and the brig Adams, the only armed American vessel on the Upper Lakes. The British Navy put it into service, and it was briefly recaptured two months later near Fort Erie. An intense US and British artillery barrage ensued, causing a fire that ultimately destroyed the battered hulk.Roosevelt, pp. 88-89 Aftermath =British= Hull's surrender was startling on both sides of the border. On the American side, many Indians took up arms and attacked American settlements and isolated military outposts.Elting, pp.36‚Äì37 In Upper Canada, the population and militia were encouraged, particularly in the Western districts where they had been threatened by Hull's army. Brock forgave the local militia for their reluctance to perform their duty, instead rewarding those militiamen who had remained at their posts. More materially, the 2,500 muskets captured from Hull were distributed among the ill-equipped militia.Elting, p.34 The British gained an important post on American soil and won control over Michigan Territory and the Detroit region for most of the following year. Brock was hailed as a hero, and Tecumseh's influence was strengthened over the confederation of Indians. Brock next intended to mount a pre-emptive attack into New York State to forestall an American attack across the Niagara River. He was thwarted by an armistice arranged by Sir George Prevost. When this ended, the Americans attacked in October near Queenston, Ontario. Brock was killed at the ensuing Battle of Queenston Heights while leading a hasty counter-attack to recover a battery which had been captured by the Americans. =American= A third American invasion of Canada took place in November north of Lake Champlain. The Americans accidentally fired on each other in the dark, then retreated after a brief engagement at Lacolle Mills. The Vermont newspaper Green-Mountain Farmer wrote in January 1813: \\"The whole Canadian campaign had produced nothing but 'disaster, defeat, disgrace, and ruin and death'\\". General Hull was tried by court martial and sentenced to death for his conduct at Detroit, but the sentence was commuted by President Madison to dismissal from the Army in recognition of his honorable service in the American Revolution. American attempts to regain Detroit were continually thwarted by poor communications and the difficulties of maintaining militia contingents in the field, until the Americans won a naval victory at the Battle of Lake Erie on 10 September 1813. This isolated the British at Amherstburg and Detroit from their supplies and forced them to retreat. Hull's successor Major General William Henry Harrison pursued the retreating British and their Indian allies and defeated them at the Battle of the Thames, where Tecumseh was killed. =Memorials= The British 41st Regiment (which is now perpetuated by the Royal Welsh Regiment) was awarded the battle honor \\"Detroit\\", one of the few to be awarded to British regiments for the War of 1812.

A partially navigable headwater of the Amazon River, it rises in the Andes to the southeast of Cuzco. It originates on the slopes of Khunurana in the Puno Region, Melgar Province, near the La Raya pass. It flows north-north-west for 724 kilometers before coalescing with the Tambo River to form the Ucayali River. John Walter Gregory, a British geologist, drowned in the river on June 2, 1932 while on a geological expedition to the Andes. The Urubamba is divided into Upper Urubamba and Lower Urubamba, the dividing feature being the Pongo de Mainique, an infamous whitewater canyon. Upper Urubamba The Upper Urubamba (Alto Urubamba) valley features a high population and extensive irrigation works.

The mapping was done at the request of the Peruvian military when they heard of the expedition planned by the three 18-year-olds. It was turned over to the military when the boys arrived in Iquitos.

They have toured as part of Ozzfest, Sounds of the Underground, Hellfest, and Warped Tour, as well as with bands such as In Flames, Lamb of God, As I Lay Dying, Killswitch Engage, Korn and Cavalera Conspiracy. The songs \\"Forever\\" and \\"Burn\\" were staples on MTV2's Headbanger's Ball and Revolver Magazine called them part of \\"The Future of Metal\\" after hearing the album Vendetta. Initially branded a hardcore punk band, albums like Venom and Tears and Deathless took a sharp turn towards metal, with critics likening the band's sound to that of Pantera, Sepultura, and Crowbar. History =Early years (1997‚Äì2002)= Throwdown was formed in 1997 by vocalist Keith Barney, an active member of both Adamantium and Eighteen Visions, guitarists Tommy Love and Javier Van Huss, bassist Dom Macaluso, and drummer Marc Jackson. The group took on the title Throwdown as a \\"wry irony on their collective stature,\\" at the time no band member being more than . The band released their debut, self- titled 7-inch single that same year through Prime Directive Records. Van Huss left the band and was replaced by Brandan Schieppati. After signing a recording contract with Indecision Records, they released their first studio album Beyond Repair the following year. Schieppati was replaced by Dave Peters. The following year, the new line-up released the Drive Me Dead EP. In 2001, Throwdown was scheduled to release a split 7\\" vinyl with Poison the Well through Surprise Attack Records. Instead, the band released their second studio album, You Don't Have to Be Blood to Be Family. Not long afterward, Jackson left the band, who, lacking a permanent replacement, recruited Barney's 18 Visions bandmate Ken Floyd to fill-in. Floyd appeared on their self-released 2002 EP Face the Mirror. The same year, Barney told the band he'd like to switch from vocals to guitar, as he would often lose his voice on tour, so Peters took over on vocals. Barney would often miss shows due to his commitments to 18 Visions; Matt Mentley was drafted to fill in for him. =Haymaker (2003‚Äì2004)= In 2003, Throwdown recorded and released Haymaker, featuring the Peters-penned straight-edge anthem \\"Forever,\\" on Trustkill Records. The lineup was Peters on vocals, Macaluso on bass, Love & Barney on guitars, and session drummer Jarred Alexander. A tour with Hatebreed followed in support of the album's release. As Barney stayed busy with 18 Visions, Macaluso and Love started the band The Lost, who released an EP with Indecision very reminiscent of the group HIM. Mentley officially replaced Barney in 2004. The band played Japan, with a fill in drummer, and embarked on a short tour of Europe with new drummer Ben Dussault. Former drummer Jackson filled in for Love, on guitar. Peters, Mentley, Dussault, Macaluso, and Love spent the summer of 2004 on Ozzfest's second stage. In the fall, they toured with Norma Jean, followed by a successful U.S. tour co-headlined by Lamb Of God and Fear Factory, with additional support from Children of Bodom. Love left the band, on good terms, at the end of that year. =Vendetta (2005‚Äì2006)= Throwdown spent the early part of the year recording Vendetta, made at Planet Z Studios with producer Zeuss. Mark Choiniere joined the band shortly before the album was recorded, although he does not appear in the music video for \\"Burn\\". Peters, Dussault, Choiniere, Mentley & Macaluso hit the inaugural Sounds Of The Underground tour that summer. In the fall, they headlined a US tour sponsored by To Die For Clothing with Sinai Beach as support. Following this tour, Macaluso, the band's only remaining original member, exited Throwdown. Mentley switched to bass, with Mark Choiniere covering all guitar duties in the live setting. Throwdown has remained a four- piece ever since. Throwdown toured with As I Lay Dying, In Flames and Soulfly at various points, co-headlined with The Black Dahlia Murder and went to South America, Australia and on a US headliner with Zao, Evergreen Terrace and Maylene and the Sons of Disaster as support. They also played a handful of West Coast Vans Warped Tour dates and the UK's Download Festival in 2006, alongside Metallica and Guns N' Roses. =Venom & Tears (2007‚Äì2008)= Throwdown recorded Venom & Tears with producer Mudrock in Los Angeles. They spent the summer headlining the Ernie Ball stage on the Vans Warped Tour. After Warped Tour, they filmed a video for \\"Holy Roller\\" with director Andy Reale. In the fall, they supported Machine Head on a US tour. Mentley left the band afterward. His replacement, Mark Mitchell, made his live debut in South America in December. Mitchell had previously been the vocalist in the straight-edge, vegan metalcore band Culture in the mid-1990s and had also played guitar in Until the End and Red Roses for a Blue Lady. In February, the band commenced headlining the \\"Scum Of The Earth Tour\\" in support of Venom And Tears with Soilwork, Through the Eyes of the Dead and War of Ages in tow. They also appeared on tour with Korn in Australia in April. This was followed by a trek supporting Killswitch Engage in Canada and a return to the UK Download Festival, as well as several other European festivals and shows. They next toured in the US with Cavalera Conspiracy, sharing the main support slot with The Dillinger Escape Plan. Dussault exited the band sometime after that tour. In March 2008 Throwdown announced that they had fulfilled their contractual obligations and were no longer signed to Trustkill Records. In December 2008, the band signed to Koch Records and began working on their sixth album. In the same announcement, it was stated that Jarrod Alexander, who worked with the band on Haymaker, would return for the new album. =Deathless (2009‚Äì2013)= In February 2009, the band played at the second annual MusInk festival in Orange County, supporting Danzig and The Used. In the Spring, Throwdown began recording with Mudrock (who previously recorded Venom & Tears) in Los Angeles. The new album featured Peters, Choiniere, Mitchell, and session drummer Alexander. The album was mixed by Zeuss, who had produced and mixed Vendetta. They spent September and October touring Europe with Chimaira and Unearth, with Living Sacrifice drummer Lance Garvin behind the kit. On November 10, 2009, Throwdown released Deathless in North America via KOCH (now called eOne). In November and December, they headlined the Deathless Tour across America, with support from Bury Your Dead, For Today, ABACABB, and The World We Knew, again with the lineup of Peters, Choiniere, Mitchell, and Garvin. In December, the band announced they would join Five Finger Death Punch and Shadows Fall on a lengthy U.S. tour set for January and February of 2010. However, without a permanent replacement for Dussault, Choiniere opted to bow out of Throwdown roughly two weeks before the start of the tour. Throwdown dropped out of the tour and was replaced on the bill by the band God Forbid. Deathless was released in Europe on January 25, 2010, via Nuclear Blast Records. In October 2011, Throwdown headlined a short West Coast trek dubbed \\"Brawloween.\\" The lineup was Peters and Mitchell with Demon Hunter drummer Tim \\"Yogi\\" Watts and then Bleeding Through guitarist Dave Nassie filling in. Support for the shows included Carnifex, First Blood, and Suffokate. =Intolerance & Take Cover (2014‚Äìpresent)= After a long period of inactivity, Throwdown released a brand new album, Intolerance, on January 21, 2014, via eOne Music. It was produced by Peters with Davey Worsop and mixed/mastered by Zeuss. Peters performed everything on the album, save for drums (handled by longtime session player Alexander) and guitar solos, which were tracked by Nassie. Since the release of Intolerance, the band has made only two live appearances: at Canada's Amnesia Rockfest in 2014 and Belgium's Groezrock Festival in 2015. Both shows featured Dave Peters on vocals and the return of bassist Matt Mentley, with Alexander and Nassie filling in. In April 2020, Throwdown released a surprise EP, Take Cover, collecting five cover songs from over the years. The EP was issued by the band's own label, Pit Viper Records. Throwdown's Trustkill era albums are now on all digital services via Pit Viper Records, as well.

The name 'ConFest' is a concatenation of the words Conference and Festival. ConFest was initiated in 1976, and organised by the former Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, Dr. Jim Cairns, his private secretary Junie Morosi and David Ditchburn. It was and is intended to bring together the various subcultures of the alternative movement, and was billed as \\"An Exploration of Alternatives\\". The event has been run almost continuously by the same cooperative society; The Down To Earth Co-op (DTE), based in Victoria. ConFest now hosts some 7000 participants annually for a 5-day festival over the Australia's Easter long weekend. The current ConFest Site is located to the West of Deniliquin and about 12km from Moulamein in New South Wales. The area is open forest with the Edward River running along the southern side of the property. Features Spontaneous choir Easter ConFest 2014Confest is typically divided up in to a number of discreet \\"villages\\" situated along a tree-lined river. These villages host a number of themed \\"spaces\\" where participants host workshops that are listed on an open agenda board displayed centrally in the festival. Workshops typically include yoga, meditation, permaculture, arts, music, and sexuality. However, many of the spaces are open to a range of eclectic and diverse topics. Villages also host shared kitchen spaces where communal cooking and food sharing is encouraged. The extensive Arts Village hosts many of the festivals major gathering points. Villages surround a central open paddock which hosts a food and arts marketplace. This marketplace is the only location within the festival where money is used. It also hosts a number of activities such as a spontaneous choir and informal fashion parade. Surrounding the marketplace is a dedicated area for fire-twirling, an information tent where participants can find out about the various villages and workshops, and a silent disco space. Villages and notable spaces (Easter Confest 2019) History The first ConFest was held in 1976 on a property at Cotter River near Canberra in the Australian Capital Territory. It was initiated and organised by the former Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, Dr. Jim Cairns, his private secretary Junie Morosi and David Ditchburn. In the early days, the organising committee rented space from various property owners, normally on or near the Murray River. However, due to dramatically increased insurance costs, it became increasingly difficult to locate suitable locations, until in the early years of the 21st century a property became available for purchase. After an extraordinary general meeting of DTE the decision was made to purchase the property, located near Gulpa Creek, south of Deniliquin, New South Wales. The site has outdoor camping facilities and has about of river frontage and about of space. Climate The property used for the March 2019 Confest gathering was one of two owned by the Down to Earth Cooperatives for the purpose of holding Confest gatherings. It is located approximately south-east of the New South Wales town of Moulamein and north-west of Deniliquin. This region generally has a warmer climate over Summer and Autumn, and a cooler climate over Winter relative to Melbourne where the highest proportion of event participants reside. The Summer Confest was cancelled and was not held for several years while fire mitigation work was carried out on the property. The Autumn Confest held over the Easter long weekend has continued while this has taken place. It is often referred to as \\"Easter Confest\\" due to its timing but is a non-denominational event with participants able to observe their own spiritual practices including candle lighting at designated events and spaces as long as there is no fire ban. In 2016 an additional Confest was organised for Spring. It was unable to go ahead due to flooding. Legal issues In 2015 police reported that 38 of 54 people searched on the approach road to the event were found in possession of illicit substances. There have been a number of assaults throughout the festival's history by a few individuals, including sexual assaults during massages and an attempted child abduction. In some cases, this has resulted in lifetime bans from the festival and police involvement.

Renegade also published three issues of Valentino's self-titled series, in the mid-late 1980s. In the late 1980s Valentino began working for Marvel Comics on their superhero titles. He was writer/ artist on the future-set super-hero series Guardians of the Galaxy, selected issues of What If...?, and fill-ins on most of Marvel's major titles. Valentino, a longtime fan of Guardians of the Galaxy, submitted his pitch for a new series on the group to editor-in- chief Tom DeFalco at the 1989 WonderCon. Coincidentally, DeFalco had already written his own proposal for a Guardians of the Galaxy series, but preferred Valentino's, and approved that proposal instead. That book launched in June 1990 and ran for 62 issues. This series was initially written and illustrated by Valentino, who deliberately gave it an action-oriented, \\"fun\\" feel that stood out from the typical \\"grim 'n' gritty\\" comics of the 1990s. Though Valentino had plotted the series ahead as far as issue #50, his run was cut short when he co-founded Image Comics. Having taken on two new series and the foundation of a publication company, Valentino asked editor Craig Anderson if he reduce his duties on the book to just writing, but was fired from the series. =Image Comics= He left Marvel in 1992 to co-found Image Comics with Whilce Portacio, Erik Larsen, Jim Lee, Rob Liefeld, Todd McFarlane and Marc Silvestri. Valentino originated several projects at Image, which he published through his own Shadowline imprint. Unlike at Marvel, where Valentino worked on characters owned by that company, the original Shadowline titles were all creator-owned. His first title under the Image banner was the super-hero series ShadowHawk, on which he was both writer and artist. In 1997 he began another series in black and white called A Touch of Silver, a semi- autobiographical book about a young comic book fan coming of age in the 1960s. Also during this time he repackaged most of his earliest autobiographical work into a trade paperback called Vignettes, with an introduction by Dave Sim. In 1999 he became the publisher of Image Comics. Under his directorship the company diversified its line considerably. The results were mixed. On one hand, Valentino's efforts led to the discovery of a number of talented creators, including Robert Kirkman and Brian Michael Bendis. On the other hand, with the earlier departure of Marc Silvestri's Top Cow from Image and the 1999 sale of Jim Lee's WildStorm to DC Comics, Image Comics saw a drop in overall sales. Still, he was able to turn the company's first profit in nearly a decade by opening new revenue streams such as sales to traditional book stores and libraries. The company managed to maintain its standing as number three in overall market share. In 2003, Valentino was replaced as publisher of Image Comics by Erik Larsen, another co-founder of the company. Since then Valentino has resurrected Shadowline, his own arm of Image and has published a wide variety of books including a revived ShadowHawk series, The Collected normalman, a new auto-bio book, Drawing From Life as well as creator owned properties including Bomb Queen, After the Cape and Sam Noir. He also serves on the board of directors of the comic industry charity The Hero Initiative and on its Disbursement Committee.The Hero Initiative Disbursement Committee Retrieved February 20, 2012 In 2008 Valentino created Silverline Books, an all-ages imprint for original graphic novels. Personal life Valentino has three sons named Arron, Matthew, and Steven. Along with two daughters named Jennifer and June. He has three grandsons named Evan, Jaeden, and Parker. Jim currently lives in Oregon.

It lies in the foothills on the western side of the Conwy valley, in Wales. The river Conwy runs through the valley, running into the sea to the north, at the town of Conwy, which is about five miles north of the village. The village lies on the eastern edge of the Snowdonia National Park. Near the village lies the Iron Age fort of Pen y Gaer. The village itself has no bus service, but buses can be accessed at nearby Tal-y-Bont. In recent years the village has become popular with ornithologists as one of the best places in Wales to observe rare hawfinches. They feed adjacent to the churchyard, attracting many bird watchers in early spring.Daily Post - Bird notes The Biggest Twitch  Name of the village  The road to Llyn Eigiau from Llanbedr-y-Cennin \\"Llanbedr\\" means St Peter's church in Welsh, while Cennin can refer to leeks or to daffodils, the latter being \\"Cennin Pedr\\" (St Peter's leeks) in Welsh.  Historical background  Peter‚Äôs Well drawn by Henry Harris Lines in 1872 or 1873 The village grew out of a mainly pastoral industry (mostly sheep farming and dairy produce). It has a parish church (Anglican), a Nonconformist chapel (Independent), and a local pub (Ye Olde Bull Inn) which served J.W. Lees real ale (from a Manchester brewery). In the 1960s, the village's only shop used to be a bakery and post office also, but the post office has been discontinued. The public house closed its doors to the public as a J.W. Lees owned pub for the last time in May 2018. On the 27th September 2019 the pub re-opened as a Free house. An ancient well at Llanbedr- y-Cennin, ‚Äò‚Äô (‚ÄòPeter‚Äôs Well‚Äô) was believed to have healing powers. =Artists' Colony= The latter 19th century saw a number of artists living in Llanbedr- y-cennin and neighbouring Tal-y-bont. The art movement, which had started in Betws-y-coed in the 1850s, saw a movement down the valley after the arrival of the railway in Betws-y-coed. Initial settlement was in Trefriw, and the 1871 census listed the first artist settler in Llanbedr/Tal-y-bont as J.Cole. There were 7 artists living here by the 1881 census, and 15 by 1891.Artists in the Conwy Valley, by T. Ellis, 2010 Charles Potter, an artist from Oldham (many of the artists were originally from the Manchester area), was instrumental in setting up the Tal-y-bont Artists Club, and in raising funds to construct in 1886 the ‚ÄòArtists Club‚Äô building at Tal-y-bont (actually Llandbedr-y-cennin), and he became its first President. The group had originally starting meeting informally at the Olde Bull Inn in 1883, then in 1884 used the upper floor of a stable building (above a carpenter‚Äôs workshop, and now demolished) as their first studio. Named ‚ÄúWalden‚Äù, the building offered a studio, a gallery, a classroom, a billiard room, and entertainment space. It originally had 40 members, male artists who lived or worked locally, although there were 150 honorary members. It had a committee of 17 members. The building was also used to hold art courses for clubs from far-and-wide, and every autumn there was an exhibition, despite the fact that this was not an altogether accessible place to the average picture-buying tourist. Nevertheless, membership (including non-resident members) grew to a number approaching 150. The artist colony was a strong influence on the formation of the Royal Cambrian Academy of Art, which moved into Plas Mawr, Conwy in 1886. The colony came to an end at the onset of World War I, and in the 1920s the building became a private home.The Betws-y-coed Artists' Colony, 1844-1914, by Peter Lord, Coast & Country, 1998, 2009.

It is named after the Brazilian aviation pioneer Alberto Santos Dumont (1873‚Äì1932). It is operated by Infraero. Santos Dumont has slot restrictions operating with a maximum of 19 operations/hour, being one of the five airports with such restrictions in Brazil. History The Seaplane terminal on the day of its dedication. Panair Terminal Originally known as Calabou√ßo Airport, the history of the airport can be traced back to the early 1930s. Until that time,the few aircraft equipped with landing gear used Manguinhos Airport. Seaplanes, which at the time operated the majority of domestic and international flights, used a terminal located at the Calabou√ßo Point, an area known today as Pra√ßa Marechal √Çncora. Take-off and landings were made using an area of Guanabara Bay then known as estir√£o do Caju (Caju water stretch). It was as a development of the terminal at Calabou√ßo Point that Calabou√ßo Airport was created. A new public terminal building for seaplanes was inaugurated on 29 October 1938. It was a replacement for the original passenger terminal and was used by all airlines except Panair do Brasil and Pan American World Airways, which used their own facilities. Due to the obsolescence of seaplanes, it ceased to be used in 1942. Today, this protected building houses the Historical and Cultural Institute of the Brazilian Air Force (INCAER). In 1934, in order to handle a growing amount of land operations, land was reclaimed from the sea to create the first runway of the airport with a length of . In 1936, the runway was extended to and on 30 November it received its first commercial flight, a VASP Junkers Ju 52 aircraft flying from S√£o Paulo‚ÄìCongonhas. The airport complex was inaugurated on 16 October 1936 and was named Santos Dumont Airport. It was also in 1936 that the construction of a new passenger terminal began. It was a project led by the architects MMM Roberto (Marcelo, Milton and Mauricio Roberto Doria- Baptista) inspired in the Paris - Le Bourget Airport terminal. Its pioneering, modernist, architectural features created a Brazilian national landmark. It was only in 1947 that its construction was completed. This building continues to be used to the present day. In the lobby of this terminal, (now the arrivals terminal) two monumental paintings by Cadmo Fausto de Sousa can be seen. Named \\"Old Aviation\\" and \\"Modern Aviation\\", they feature many old and new means of flying. Both were unveiled in 1951. The original terminal building, which now handles only arrivals. Adjoining the original seaplane terminal, Pan American World Airways and its Brazilian subsidiary Panair do Brasil constructed their own dedicated terminal for seaplanes and aircraft with landing gear. This terminal opened in 1937 featuring architecture inspired by the Pan American Seaplane Base and Terminal Building in Miami. It included a passenger terminal, offices and hangars. It remained the headquarters of Panair do Brasil until the airline was forced to cease its operations in 1965. It is now the headquarters of the Third Regional Air Command of the Brazilian Air Force. On 21 May 1959 a formal agreement between Varig, Cruzeiro do Sul, and VASP created an air shuttle service (), the first of its kind in the world. This service operated between Rio de Janeiro‚ÄìSantos Dumont Airport and S√£o Paulo‚ÄìCongonhas and comprised regular hourly departures, common check-in counter, and simplified tickets and formalities. The service was an instant success. Transbrasil joined the partnership in 1968. Starting in 1975 the service was operated exclusively by Varig's Lockheed L-188 Electra propjets. In 1999 this service came to an end because airlines decided to operate their own independent services. Over the years, the airport's main runway has been extended several times, first to , then to , and finally . With the gradual shift of international operations to Gale√£o Airport, opened in 1952, Rio de Janeiro‚ÄìSantos Dumont lost its place as an international hub, but for many years retained its position of a major hub for domestic traffic, particularly until 1960, when the capital of Brazil was moved to Bras√≠lia. The airport handles only part of Rio's short-to-medium haul domestic air traffic, and part of its general aviation and military operations. The airport is famous for having some of the shortest runways on which some Boeing and Airbus aircraft can land. An idea of these operations is given in the 007‚ÄìJames Bond film Moonraker of 1979, in which a Lockheed L-188 Electra briefly appears taking-off from the airport. The new terminal building opened in 2007 and handles all departures. Due to a fire that almost destroyed the main terminal in 1999, the passenger terminal building was closed for 6 months. On 26 May 2007, in time for the 2007 Pan American Games, a brand-new, modern extension of the original terminal was opened. This extension handles all departure operations, whilst the original terminal now handles all arrival operations. The new departures terminal increased the total capacity of the airport to 8.0 million passengers/year. It was announced on 5 August 2009 that in order to renew its operational licence the Rio de Janeiro State Environment Institute (INEA) would require Santos Dumont Airport to adjust operational standards. After a meeting between INEA and Infraero held on 3 September 2009, the following compromise was reached: approach route 2 is used only when specific wind conditions that amount to 30% of total operations so require; the airport is closed between 23:00 and 06:00 hours: aircraft may depart or arrive until 22:30 hours, giving a half-hour tolerance period; and the maximum amount of flights per hour was reduced from 23 to 19. On 31 August 2009, Infraero unveiled a BRL152.2 million (US$80.2 million; EUR64.5 million) investment plan to upgrade Santos Dumont Airport, particularly the passenger arrivals terminal. The plan focused on the preparations for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, which was held in Brazil and Rio de Janeiro being one of the venue cities, and the 2016 Summer Olympics. The renovation was completed in 2013. Whilst this airport is quite conveniently located very close to the city centre, the location is problematic because aircraft have Sugarloaf Mountain on the direct approach path, meaning that whilst installing an ILS system would be feasible because of the relatively clear approach path onto runways 20L/20R, it is not feasible as if an ILS was installed on runways 02L/02R, the glide path would head through Sugar Loaf. This means that aircraft have to negotiate the mountainous terrain beyond the two runways by either: a. flying over the bay entrance, then quickly swerving behind Sugar Loaf on to the runway glide path, or b. fly over central Rio and negotiate the mountainous terrain not just around Sugar Loaf, but also around the central west of Rio.

The attacking force consisted of a flotilla of gunboats of the Union Navy drawn from the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, commanded by Flag Officer Louis M. Goldsborough, a separate group of gunboats under Union Army control, and an army division led by Brig. Gen. Ambrose Burnside. The defenders were a group of gunboats from the Confederate States Navy, termed the Mosquito Fleet, under Capt. William F. Lynch, and about 2,000 Confederate soldiers commanded locally by Brig. Gen. Henry A. Wise. The defense was augmented by four forts facing on the water approaches to Roanoke Island, and two outlying batteries. At the time of the battle, Wise was hospitalized, so leadership fell to his second in command, Col. Henry M. Shaw. During the first day of the battle, the Federal gunboats and the forts on shore engaged in a gun battle, with occasional contributions from the Mosquito Fleet. Late in the day, Burnside's soldiers went ashore unopposed; they were accompanied by six howitzers manned by sailors. As it was too late to fight, the invaders went into camp for the night. On the second day, February 8, the Union soldiers advanced but were stopped by an artillery battery and accompanying infantry in the center of the island. Although the Confederates thought that their line was safely anchored in impenetrable swamps, they were flanked on both sides and their soldiers were driven back to refuge in the forts. The forts were taken in reverse. With no way for his men to escape, Col. Shaw surrendered to avoid pointless bloodshed. Background Northeastern North Carolina is dominated by its sounds; large but shallow bodies of brackish-to-salt water that lie between the mainland and the Outer Banks. Although they are all one body, intimately connected and having a common water level, they are conceptually divided into several distinct regions. The largest of these is Pamlico Sound, immediately behind Hatteras Island; to its north is the second largest, Albemarle Sound, which extends almost to the southern border of Virginia. The linkage between these two, somewhat narrow, is further constricted by Roanoke Island. The portion of the waterway between Roanoke Island and the mainland is known as Croatan Sound. Both the island and the sound are about long. The sound at its widest point is a little more than across, the island about half that. On the eastern side of the island is Roanoke Sound, much narrower, shallower, and less important. Several North Carolina cities were sited on the sounds, among them New Bern (usually written New Berne in the mid-nineteenth century), Beaufort, Edenton, and Elizabeth City. Others, not lying directly on the sounds, were accessible to the rivers that emptied into them. As much as a third of the state is in their watershed. Through most of the first year of the Civil War, the Confederate forces retained control of the sounds, so that coastwise water- borne commerce of the eastern part of the state was unimpeded. The sounds were linked to Norfolk, Virginia by the Albemarle and Chesapeake Canal and the Dismal Swamp Canal. The blockade of Norfolk could not be complete so long as cargoes could reach the city through its back door. Communications were not affected appreciably when Federal forces captured the forts on the Outer Banks at Hatteras Inlet in August 1861, as the Union Navy could not bring its deep- water vessels into the sounds through the shallow inlets.Gen. Wise, the former governor of Virginia, pointed out the importance of Roanoke Island when he requested aid before the battle: ORA I, v. 9, pp. 134, 138. Following the battle, he reiterated the evaluation in a rancorous outburst: ORA I, v. 9, p. 188. Roanoke Island was the key to control of the Sounds. If controlled by the Union forces, they would have a base that could be attacked only by an amphibious operation, which the Rebels could not mount. If the Union established naval superiority there, all points on the mainland shores would be equally vulnerable to assault. The Confederate defenders would be forced into an impossible situation: they would either have to give up some positions without a fight, or they would have to spread their assets too thin to be of any use.The label \\"key\\" was frequently applied. ORA I, v. 4, pp. 578-79, 682, 718; v. 9, pp. 115, 126, 134, 138, 187, 188. Prelude =Confederate defense= The defense of Roanoke Island started in an accidental manner. When the Federal fleet appeared off Hatteras Inlet on August 27, 1861, the 3rd Georgia Infantry Regiment was hastily sent from Norfolk to help hold the forts there, but the forts fell before they arrived, so they were diverted to Roanoke Island. They remained there for the next three months, making somewhat desultory efforts to expel the Union forces from Hatteras Island.Campbell, Storm over Carolina, pp. 52‚Äì64. Little was done to secure the position until early October, when Brig. Gen. Hill was assigned to command the coastal defenses of North Carolina in the vicinity of the sounds. Hill set his soldiers to putting up earthworks across the center of the island, but he was called away to service in Virginia before they were completed.Trotter, Ironclads and columbiads, pp. 62‚Äì63. Shortly after his departure, his district was split in two; the southern part was assigned to Brig. Gen. Lawrence O'B. Branch, while the northern part was put in control of Henry A. Wise, whose command included Albemarle Sound and Roanoke Island, but not Pamlico Sound and its cities. It is also significant that Branch reported to Brig. Gen. Richard C. Gatlin, who commanded the Department of North Carolina, while Wise was under Maj. Gen. Benjamin Huger, who was in charge of the defenses of Norfolk.Trotter, Ironclads and columbiads,, pp. 62‚Äì63. Hill first reported for duty on October 4, and was relieved by Branch on November 16. Branch's district was split on December 21. Wise had been commander of the so-called Wise Legion, but his troops did not accompany him. The Legion was broken up, although he was able to retain two of his old regiments, the 46th and 59th Virginia. He also had three regiments of North Carolina troops, the 2nd, 8th, and 31st North Carolina, plus three companies of the 17th North Carolina. The men from North Carolina were ill-equipped and poorly clothed, often armed with nothing more than their own shotguns. All told, the number came to about 1,400 infantrymen, but the number available for duty was smaller than that because the living conditions put as many as one-fourth of the command on the sick list.Trotter, Ironclads and columbiads, p. 77. Battles and leaders, v. 1, p. 670. Wise begged Richmond to send him some guns, as had Hill before him, but the numbers that were actually sent were inadequate. They were distributed into several nominal forts: facing Croatan Sound were twelve guns in Fort Huger, at Weir's Point, the northwestern corner of the island; four guns in Fort Blanchard, about a mile (1.6 km) to the southeast; and nine guns in Fort Bartow, at the romantically-named Pork Point, about a quarter of the way down the island. Across the sound, at Redstone Point opposite Fort Huger, two old canal barges had been pushed up onto the mud, protected by sandbags and cotton bales, armed with seven guns, and named Fort Forrest. These were all the guns that would bear on the sound; the southern half of the island, nearest Pamlico Sound, in the direction from which the attack would come, was unprotected. Five other guns did not face Croatan Sound: a battery of two guns on the eastern side of the island protected against possible assault across Roanoke Sound, and three others occupied an earthwork near the geometric center of the island.Browning, From Cape Charles to Cape Fear, p. 24. Wise made one other contribution to the defense. He found some pile drivers, and was able to impede the sound between Forts Huger and Forrest by a double row of piles, augmented by sunken hulks. The barrier was still being worked on when the attack came.Trotter, Ironclads and columbiads, p. 76. The Confederate Navy also made a contribution to the defense. Seven gunboats, mounting a total of only eight guns, formed the Mosquito Fleet, commanded by Flag Officer William F. Lynch. Wise, for one, believed that their net contribution was negative. Not only were their guns taken from the forts on the island, but so were their crews. He gave vent to his feelings after the battle: > Captain Lynch was energetic, zealous, and active, but he gave too much > consequence entirely to his fleet of gunboats, which hindered transportation > of piles, lumber, forage, supplies of all kinds, and of troops, by taking > away the steam-tugs and converting them into perfectly imbecile gunboats.ORA > I, v. 9, p. 129. Lynch was not the only target of Wise's invective; this > link gives other examples. Despite Wise's disapproval, the Mosquito Fleet was part of the defense, and the Union forces would have to deal with it. =Union offense= A short time after Hatteras Island was captured for the Union, Burnside began to promote the idea of a Coast Division, to be composed of fishermen, dockworkers, and other watermen from the northeastern states, and used to attack coastal areas. He reasoned that such men were already familiar with ships, and therefore would be easy to train for amphibious operations. Burnside was a close friend of General-in-Chief George B. McClellan, so he got a respectful hearing. Although Burnside had initially intended to operate in Chesapeake Bay, in the hands of McClellan and the War Department his ideas were soon transformed into a planned assault on the North Carolina interior coast, beginning with Roanoke Island. An unspoken reason for the change of target was the mistaken belief that pro-Union sentiment was being suppressed in North Carolina, and an invasion would allow them to express their true loyalties.Browning, From Cape Charles to Cape Fear, pp. 19‚Äì21. North Carolina was indeed only loosely attached to the Confederacy, but most pro-Union activity and sentiment was found in the mountainous western part of the state. When it was fleshed out, the invasion of North Carolina came to be known as the Burnside Expedition. As recruiting progressed, Burnside organized the Coast Division into three brigades, led by three friends from his Military Academy days. Brig. Gen. John G. Foster led the First Brigade, Brig. Gen. Jesse L. Reno the Second, and Brig. Gen. John G. Parke the Third.Burnside, Battles and leaders, p. 661. In early January, nearly 13,000 men were ready for duty.ORA I, v. 9, p. 358. Although the Union Navy would provide most of the gunnery that would be needed to suppress the Rebel batteries, Burnside decided to have some gunboats under Army control. This immediately led to some interference between the two services. The Navy had no vessels sturdy enough to go to sea and at the same time draw little enough water to be able to pass through the shallow inlet, thought to be about . They therefore had to buy suitable merchant ships for conversion, at the very time that Burnside and his agents were also dickering for their ships. Because the sailors were more experienced, they were able to get most of the more suitable ships. The Army was left with a mixed bag of rickety ships that were barely seaworthy.Merrill, The Rebel shore, pp. 86‚Äì87. By the time the expedition got under way, the Navy had 20 gunboats, and the Coast Division had nine. The armada was supplemented by several canal boats converted into floating batteries, mounting boat howitzers and protected by sandbags and bales of hay. All told, the expedition carried 108 pieces of ordnance.Trotter, Ironclads and columbiads, p. 68. While Burnside's agents were purchasing the gunboats they were also buying or leasing other vessels to be used as transports. The soldiers and transports for the expedition assembled at Annapolis. Embarkation began on January 5, 1862, and on January 9 they began to get under way, with orders to rendezvous at Fort Monroe, near the entrance to Chesapeake Bay. There they met the naval contingent, and on January 11 they set sail. Until this time, only Burnside and his immediate staff knew their ultimate destination. Once at sea, the captain of each ship opened his sealed orders and learned that his ship should proceed to the vicinity of Cape Hatteras.Burnside, Battles and leaders, pp. 662‚Äì663. Opposing forces =Union= =Confederate= Battle =From Chesapeake Bay to Pamlico Sound= Sketch showing route of Burnside's forces to Hatteras Inlet. U.S. Government Printing Office, 1866 For many of the Federal soldiers, the voyage to Hatteras Inlet was the worst part of the battle. Earning its reputation, the weather in the vicinity of Cape Hatteras turned foul, causing many of them to become seasick. In an act of bravado, Burnside left his comfortable quarters aboard the transport George Peabody and with his staff went aboard Army gunboat Picket. He chose this vessel because he considered her to be the least seaworthy ship in his command, and by showing his troops that he was willing to share their misery, he earned their devotion. When the storm struck, he began to doubt the wisdom of his move, but Picket survived and got him safely to his destination. Three vessels in the armada were not so lucky: City of New York, laden with ordnance and supplies; Pocahontas, carrying horses; and Army gunboat Zouave were all lost, although all persons aboard were rescued. The only personnel losses were two officers of the 9th New Jersey, who were drowned when their surfboat overturned following a visit to the flagship.Burnside, Battles and leaders, v. 1, pp. 663-65. The entry into Pamlico Sound through Hatteras Inlet was time consuming. The swash, thought to be deep, was found the hard way to be only . Some of the Union Army ships drew too much to get across, and had to be kedged in after being lightened. Others were too deep even to be kedged in; the men or materials they carried had to be brought ashore on Hatteras Island, and the ships sent back. Bark John Trucks never made it at all; she could not get close enough to Hatteras Island even for the men aboard to be taken off. She returned to Annapolis with the majority of the regiment, the 53rd New York, a detachment of the command was active in the battle of Roanoke islandThe Union Army, Vol. 2, p. 89ORA I, v. 9, pp. 361‚Äì362. Not until February 4 was the fleet as ready as it ever would be and assembled in Pamlico Sound.Burnside, Battles and leaders, v. 1, pp. 664‚Äì666. While the Northern fleet was struggling over the bar, the Confederates were strangely inert. No reinforcements were sent to the island, or, for that matter, any of the other possible targets in the region. The number of infantrymen on the island remained at about 1,400, with 800 in reserve at Nag's Head. The major change was negative: on February 1 Wise came down with what he called \\"pleurisy, with high fever and spitting of blood, threatening pneumonia.\\" He was confined to bed at Nag's Head, and remained hospitalized until February 8, after the battle was over. Although he continued to issue orders, effective command on Roanoke Island fell to Col. H. M. Shaw of the 8th North Carolina Infantry.ORA I, v. 9, p. 145. =First day: Bombardment= Map of Roanoke Island, showing forts and fleet dispositions, February 7, 1862, on the left, and on the right, the battlefield where opposing armies met on February 8. Prepared by Lt. Andrews, 9th N.Y. Regiment. The fleet got under way early the morning after they had assembled in the sound (February 5), and by nightfall were near the southern end of Roanoke Island, where they anchored. Rain and strong winds prevented movements the next day. The major activity was Goldsborough's shift of his flag from USS Philadelphia to Southfield. On February 7 the weather moderated, and the Navy gunboats got into position. They first fired a few shells inland at Ashby Harbor, the intended landing place, and determined that the defenders had no batteries there. They then moved up Croatan Sound, where they were divided; some were ordered to fire on the fort at Pork Point (Fort Bartow), while others were to concentrate their fire on the seven vessels of the Mosquito Fleet. At about noon, the bombardment began.Browning, From Cape Charles to Cape Fear, pp. 24‚Äì25 The weakness of the Confederate position was revealed at this time. Only four of the guns at Fort Bartow would bear on the Union gunboats. Forts Huger and Blanchard could not contribute at all. Fort Forrest, on the other side of the sound, was rendered completely useless when gunboat CSS Curlew, holed at the waterline, ran ashore directly in front in her effort to avoid sinking, and in so doing masked the guns of the fort.Trotter, Ironclads and columbiads, p. 79. Losses were light on both sides despite the intensity of the fight. Several of the Union ships were hit, but none suffered severe damage. This was true for the Confederates also, aside from Curlew, but the remaining Mosquito Fleet had to retire simply because they ran out of ammunition.Trotter, Ironclads and columbiads, pp. 80‚Äì81. The Army transports, accompanied by its gunboats, had in the meantime arrived at Ashby Harbor, near the midpoint of the island. At 15:00, Burnside ordered the landings to begin, and at 16:00 the troops were reaching shore. A 200-man strong Confederate force commanded by Col. John V. Jordan (31st North Carolina), in position to oppose the landing, was discovered and fired on by the gunboats; the defenders fled without any attempt to return fire.Jordan later stated that he retreated in order not to be cut off, that he was under positive orders to save his artillery \\"at all hazards.\\" ORA I, v. 9, p. 176. There was no further opposition. Almost all of the 10,000 men present were ashore by midnight. With the infantry went six launches with boat howitzers, commanded by a young midshipman, Benjamin H. Porter. The Union soldiers pushed inland a short distance and then went into camp for the night.Trotter, Ironclads and columbiads, p. 81. Burnside, Battles and leaders, pp. 667‚Äì668. =Second day: Union advance and Confederate surrender= The Federal soldiers moved out promptly on the morning of February 8, advancing north on the only road on the island. Leading was the First Brigade's 25th Massachusetts, with Midshipman Porter's howitzers immediately following. They were soon halted, when they struck the Confederate redoubt and some 400 infantry blocking their path. Another thousand Confederates were in reserve, about to the rear; the front was so constricted that Col. Shaw could deploy only a quarter of his men. The defensive line ended in what were deemed impenetrable swamps on both sides, so Shaw did not protect his flanks.This is a presumption. Shaw did not explain why his flanks were uncovered. Trotter, Ironclads and columbiads, p. 83. Union troops assault the Confederate three-gun battery The leading elements of the First Brigade spread out to match their opponents' configuration, and for two hours the combatants fired at each other through blinding clouds of smoke. The 10th Connecticut relieved the exhausted, but not badly bloodied, 25th Massachusetts, but they too could not advance. No progress was made until the Second Brigade arrived, and its commander, Brig. Gen. Jesse L. Reno, ordered them to try to penetrate the \\"impenetrable\\" swamp on the Union left. Brig. Gen. John G. Foster then ordered two of his reserve regiments to do the same on the right. About this time, Brig. Gen. John G. Parke came up with the Third Brigade, and it was immediately sent to assist. Although they were not coordinated, the two flanking movements emerged from the swamp at nearly the same time. Reno ordered his 21st Massachusetts, 51st New York, and 9th New Jersey to attack. As they were firing on the Confederates, the 23rd Massachusetts, from the First Brigade, appeared on the other end of the line. The defensive line began to crack; noting this, Foster ordered his remaining forces to attack. Under assault from three sides, the Confederates broke and fled.Trotter, Ironclads and columbiads, pp. 84‚Äì85. As no fall-back defenses had been set up, and he was bereft of artillery, Col. Shaw surrendered to Foster. Included in the capitulation were not only the 1,400 infantry that he commanded directly, but also the guns in the forts. Two additional regiments (2nd North Carolina and 46th Virginia) had been sent as reinforcements. They arrived too late to take part in the battle, but not too late to take part in the surrender. Altogether, some 2,500 men became prisoners of war.Trotter, Ironclads and columbiads, pp. 86‚Äì87. Aside from the men who went into captivity, casualties were rather light by American Civil War standards. The Federal forces lost 37 killed, 214 wounded, and 13 missing. The Confederates lost 23 killed, 58 wounded, and 62 missing.Battles and leaders, v.1, p. 670. Many of the Confederate missing were North Carolinians, and were presumed to have fled to their homes. Aftermath Roanoke Island remained in Union control for the rest of the war. Immediately after the battle, the Federal gunboats passed the now-silent Confederate forts into Albemarle Sound, and destroyed what was left of the Mosquito Fleet at the Battle of Elizabeth City. Burnside used the island as staging ground for later assaults on New Bern and Fort Macon, resulting in their capture. Several minor expeditions took other towns on the sounds. The Burnside Expedition ended only in July, when its leader was called to Virginia to take part in the Richmond campaign. After Burnside left, North Carolina ceased to be an active center of the war. With only one or two exceptions, no notable military actions took place until the last days of the conflict, when the Second Battle of Fort Fisher closed Wilmington, the last open port in the Confederacy. The Army classified the slaves on Roanoke Island as contraband and by late 1862, hundreds more escaped slaves had joined them. While Foster was commander of the Department of North Carolina, in 1863 he appointed Horace James, a Congregational chaplain, as \\"Superintendent of Negro Affairs for the North Carolina District\\", encouraging him to support the former slaves in becoming educated, growing their own food, and working. Based in New Bern, James supervised the Trent River contraband camp there, but decided to make Roanoke Island a self-sustaining colony. The Freedmen's Colony of Roanoke Island was an important model that lasted four years; it had a sawmill, established a fisheries, and by 1864 it had 2200 residents. It was overcrowded when residents reached 3900 at its peak, in part because poor soil on the island limited productivity of agriculture. Many of its people worked for the Army for wages, and more than 150 men enlisted in the United States Colored Troops. Missionary teachers recruited by the American Missionary Association taught reading and writing to classes of both children and adults. It was an important step toward citizenship for the freedmen.\\"The Roanoke Island Freedmen's Colony\\", provided by National Park Service, at North Carolina Digital History: LEARN NC, accessed 11 November 2010 See also *Burnside's North Carolina Expedition Notes Abbreviations used in these notes: :ORA (Official records, armies): War of the Rebellion: a compilation of the official records of the Union and Confederate Armies. :ORN (Official records, navies): Official records of the Union and Confederate Navies in the War of the Rebellion.

It is the movement of a market from differentiated to undifferentiated price competition and from monopolistic competition to perfect competition. Hence, the key effect of commoditization is that the pricing power of the manufacturer or brand owner is weakened: when products become more similar from a buyer's point of view, they will tend to buy the cheapest. This is not to be confused with commodification, which is the concept in Marxist economic theory for objects or services being assigned an exchange value which they did not previously possess by their being produced and presented for sale, as opposed to personal use. One way to summarize the difference is that commoditization is about proprietary things becoming generic, whereas commodification is about nonsaleable things becoming saleable. In social sciences, particularly anthropology, the term is used interchangeably with commodification to describe the process of making commodities out of anything that was not available for trade previously.Appadurai, Arjun, ed.

The design was eventually used as the basis for most MIPS-based Windows NT systems. In part because Microsoft intended NT to be portable between various microprocessor architectures, the MIPS RISC architecture was chosen for one of the first development platforms for the NT project in the late 1980s/early 1990s. However, around 1990, the existing MIPS-based systems (such as the TURBOchannel-equipped DECstation or the SGI Indigo) varied drastically from standard Intel personal computers such as the IBM AT--for example, neither used the ISA bus so common in Intel 386-class machines. For those and other reasons, Microsoft decided to design their own MIPS-based hardware platform on which to develop NT, which resulted in the Jazz architecture. Later, Microsoft sold this architecture design to the MIPS Computer Systems, Inc. where it became the MIPS Magnum. The Jazz architecture includes: *a MIPS R4000/R4400 or compatible microprocessor *an EISA bus *a framebuffer for video output (the G364 framebuffer) *PS/2 connectors for mouse and keyboard * a Floppy-disk controller *onboard 16-bit sound system *onboard National Semiconductor SONIC Ethernet *onboard NCR 53C9x SCSI chipset for hard disk and CD-ROM interface *standard IBM AT serial and parallel ports *IBM AT-style time-of-year clock This design was simple enough and powerful enough that a majority of Windows NT-capable MIPS systems were based on modified versions of the Jazz architecture.

The Ionian Bank (IB) was a British overseas bank that investors established in 1839 to operate in the Ionian Isles, which was then a British Protectorate. It served also as the central bank of the United States of the Ionian Islands. IB later expanded in Greece and the Eastern Mediterranean. After losing its branches in Egypt to nationalization, IB retreated from the Mediterranean, selling all its operations there. Michael Behrens and John Trusted then acquired Ionian Bank, converting it into a merchant bank in London. This London operation was never very successful and in 1977 it voluntarily gave up its banking licence. The Greek operation, renamed Ionian Popular Bank, was absorbed into Alpha Bank in 2000. History A \\"decree of the Eminent Senate of the Commonwealth of Ionian Islands\\" established the Ionian State Bank in 1839, to finance trade between the Ionian Islands (a British protectorate), and Great Britain. This made the bank the oldest in Greece. The bank received a 20-year grant of the exclusive privilege of issuing and circulating banknotes for the Ionian Islands. The bank soon changed its name to Ionian Bank (IB), and initially only operated in the Ionian Islands, opening branches in Corfu, Zakynthos and Kefalonia the following year. In 1845, a year after the bank received a UK Royal Charter, it established agencies in Athens and Patras, and appointed special agents in Venice and Trieste. In 1864, the Ionian Islands united with Greece. A new charter made IB a Soci√©t√© Anonyme, with the Greek government assuming its debt. That year too IB converted its agencies in Athens and Patras to full branches (possibly before 1864.) IB then extended its operations to the rest of Greece. The Athens office took over as Head Office from the Corfu office in 1873. By 1880 the bank had lost its legal monopoly position in the Islands, but gained an extension to its (no longer exclusive) right of note issue. In 1883, IB gave up its Royal Charter and registered as a limited liability company. IB retained its Greek charter until 1905 and expanded into Egypt by opening branches in Alexandria in 1907. During World War I, Ionian Bank served Allied military interests in the Balkans, opening branches at Salonika, Syra, Chios and Mitylene. =Between the Wars= Ionian Bank's former branch in Nicosia In 1920, Ionian Bank lost its privilege of note issue. Two years later, IB acquired the Constantinople branch of Guaranty Trust Co. of New York, and possibly a sub-branch or agency in Smyrna. In 1924, IB continued its international expansion by opening a representative office in New York. Then in 1926, IB established a branch in Nicosia, Cyprus and next year agencies in Famagusta, Limassol and Larnaca. IB retreated from New York in 1928, closing its branch office there, and from Constantinople the next year by selling its branch there to Deutsche Bank. Lastly, in 1938, it acquired more than two-thirds of the share capital of Popular Bank, which was established in 1905. =World War II and after= During World War II, the Italians forcibly acquired IB's holdings in Popular Bank and ran it as an Italian bank for the duration. At the end of the War, IB regained its holdings. In 1949, IB further increased its holdings in Popular Bank to four- fifths of the capital. Two years later it returned to Egypt by establishing a branch in Cairo. In 1956, the Egyptian government established Bank Al- Goumhourieh to take over the Egyptian operations of Ionian Bank and the Ottoman Bank in the wake of the Suez Canal War. IB had provided cover for British Intelligence (two directors of the bank, Sir Bickham Sweet-Escott and Robin Brooke, belonged to MI6), but all British and French banks were nationalized by Egypt at the same time. The next year IB sold its Greek assets to the Commercial Bank of Greece, which maintained IB as a separate entity, and its assets in Cyprus to the Chartered Bank. The Greek IB became the Ionian and Popular Bank of Greece by merging with its subsidiary, Popular Bank. Eventually, Alpha Bank purchased the Ionian and Popular Bank of Greece in 1999, and absorbed it in 2000. Commercial Bank of Greece bought IB's London branch.

The comic is a fictional retelling of the Battle of Thermopylae and the events leading up to it from the perspective of Leonidas of Sparta. 300 was particularly inspired by the 1962 film The 300 Spartans, a film Miller watched as a young boy.Frank Miller, 300 #3 (July 1998),\\"Slings & Arrows\\" letters page, Dark Horse Comics The work was adapted in 2006 to a film of the same name. In 2018, Dark Horse published Xerxes: The Fall of the House of Darius and the Rise of Alexander, also written and drawn by Miller, acting as a prequel and sequel to the events of 300, depicting Xerxes I's rise to the throne, and the subsequent destruction of the Persian Empire under his descendant Darius III, by Alexander the Great. Publication and awards Each page of the novel is illustrated as a double-page spread. When the series was gathered into hardcover form, the individual pages were twice as wide as a normal comic. Miller's art style for this project was similar to his Sin City work, although the addition of consistent color is an obvious difference. 300 was initially published as a monthly five-issue comic book limited series by Dark Horse Comics, the first issue published in May 1998. The issues were titled Honor, Duty, Glory, Combat and Victory. The series won three Eisner Awards in 1999: \\"Best Limited Series\\", \\"Best Writer/Artist\\" for Frank Miller and \\"Best Colorist\\" for Lynn Varley. The work was collected as a hardcover volume in 1999. The popularity of the film has boosted sales of the trade paperback edition. The 10th printing had an announced print run of 40,000 copies, with an 11th printing to follow. This is in addition to the 88,000 copies already sold since the initial volume was released in 1999. Synopsis In 480 BC, King Leonidas of Sparta gathers 300 of his best men to fight the upcoming Persian invasion. In what is likely a suicide mission, they and their allies plan to stop King Xerxes' invasion of Greece at the narrow cliffs of the \\"Hot Gates\\" (Thermopylae). The terrain prevents the Greeks from being overwhelmed by Xerxes' superior numbers (a military tactic usually called \\"defeat in detail\\"). Before the battle starts, Ephialtes, a deformed Spartan, begs Leonidas to let him fight but is rejected due to his hunchbacked form, which prevents him from lifting his shield high enough to be of use for the phalanx. Ephialtes becomes so desperate by Leonidas' refusal that he throws himself off a cliff. The Spartans and their allies successfully hold off the Persians for two days and nights. During a break in the fighting, Xerxes meets with Leonidas and offers wealth and power in exchange for his surrender. Leonidas declines, and battle continues. Meanwhile, Ephialtes awakes from his suicide attempt and decides to betray the Greeks by telling the Persians about the existence of a small pass that allows Xerxes to attack them from behind. Learning of the Persian maneuvers the Greeks realize their position is indefensible, but the Spartans and a few others refuse to retreat. Before engaging the Persians for the last time, Leonidas orders one Spartan (Dilios) to return home so that he might survive to tell their story. On the third day Xerxes has the Spartans surrounded, their remaining allies (Thespians) already dead. He gives Leonidas one final chance to surrender and kneel to him. After some hesitation, Leonidas finally complies and throws down his arms and kneels. This, however, is a trick by Leonidas, and signals Stelios, a loyal Spartan soldier, to jump from his back and kill a general. The Spartans fight. Leonidas throws his spear at Xerxes, intending to make the \\"God-King\\" bleed, and succeeds. The Spartans are killed to the last man by a storm of arrows. The story then shifts about a year later and ends as now-Captain Dilios relates the heroic sacrifice of Leonidas and his Spartan comrades to his troops before the historic Battle of Plataea. Criticisms Writer Alan Moore has criticized 300 as being historically inaccurate, with particular reference to the characters' attitudes towards homosexuality: Miller, in the letters page of the series, replied to accusations of homophobia from a reader regarding the phrase \\"Those boy-lovers\\": Writer David Brin has also criticized 300 as being historically inaccurate, with particular reference to the bravery and efficacy of the non-Spartan Greeks: During the Battle of Marathon, ten years previous to Thermopylae, the Spartans had been obligated to honor the Carnea, a religious festival during which military engagements were forbidden.Holland, pp. 187‚Äì190 Once the religious prohibition was lifted, the Spartan troops covered the 220 kilometers (140 mi) to Athens in a quick three days and arrived only one day after the battle had taken place. The Spartans toured the battlefield at Marathon, and agreed that the Athenians had won a great victory.Herodotus VI, 120 Xerxes' invasion happened to coincide yet again with the celebration of the Carnea. This time, however, the Spartans chose not to hold back their entire army in deference to the festival, but instead sent an advance force of 300 men under Leonidas, who were to be reinforced by a full contingent of Spartan warriors after the festival concluded. It is impossible to know for certain whether this change in policy regarding the Carnea was based in shame about missing Marathon (as Brin suggests) or merely marked a reinterpretation of the military threat posed by the invading Persians. All Herodotus tells us is that the Spartan officials did not think that the engagement at Thermopylae would be decided so quickly and intended the main part of their force to arrive before the fighting broke out.Herodotus VII, 206 References in other works There are references to the Battle at Thermopylae in several of Frank Miller's other comic books. In Sin City: The Big Fat Kill, Dwight McCarthy considers Leonidas' choice of \\"where to fight\\" and manages to loosely recreate the Spartan defense tactics by cornering the enemy gang in a tight alley; they then annihilate them with heavy gunfire and explosives. Also in Hell and Back when Wallace is drugged he sees his friend as Leonidas with a machine gun. In The Dark Knight Returns and The Dark Knight Strikes Again, Miller's \\"omega\\" Batman stories, there are references to a character named \\"Hot Gates\\" (the literal translation of Thermopylae), an adult film star who first makes a version of Snow White, and then declares herself Dictator of Ohio. In the Emmy Award-winning episode \\"Jack and the Spartans\\" of the cartoon Samurai Jack, Jack meets a group of Spartan warriors fighting Aku's minions. This episode was partially inspired by Miller's comics. Film adaptation In 2007, Zack Snyder directed a film adaptation of 300 with Frank Miller serving as executive producer to adapt his work for film. It used greenscreen technology to capture the comic book feel; the film is in fact notable for remaining extremely faithful to its source material as a result. It was released in both conventional cinemas and IMAX in 2007. In 2014, Zack Snyder directed a sequel 300: Rise of an Empire, which is based on Frank Miller's mini-series Xerxes.

An example of American Renaissance and Beaux-Arts design, the building is a California Historical Landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Carolands is one of the last of the houses built during the Gilded Age, a period of great mansion-building that included famous houses of the Vanderbilt family, such as Marble House, Biltmore Estate and The Breakers, and stately California houses such as Filoli and the Huntington family's mansions. History =Harriett Pullman Carolan= The woman who built Carolands, Harriett Pullman Carolan (1869‚Äì1956), was the daughter of George Pullman, a 19th-century industrialist, one of Chicago's wealthiest men, and founder of the Pullman Company, famous for its Palace railway cars. In Chicago in 1892, Harriett Pullman married Francis Carolan of San Francisco and moved with him to California. In 1912, she acquired of land in Hillsborough, on which she intended to build a house and garden that would excite \\"the wonder and admiration of America\\" and reflect her many refined and cultivated interests. The result was a masterpiece of Beaux-Arts architecture, inspired by the court architecture of Louis XIV. Carolan chose the site, the highest in the neighborhood, for its commanding views of the San Francisco Bay and the surrounding hills. =Architects= Harriett Carolan commissioned plans for the chateau from the Parisian architect Ernest Sanson, at the time France's foremost designer of prestigious private houses. Sanson was a classicist, and his design for the chateau's exterior was inspired by the 17th-century designs of Fran√ßois Mansart. He was seventy-six years old, near the end of a long and distinguished career, and never visited the California site. Carolan engaged the San Francisco-based Willis Polk, a distinguished architect in his own right, to be the structural designer and construction manager, instructing him to faithfully execute Sanson's designs. France's leading landscape architect, Achille Duch√™ne, designed Carolands' gardens. Duch√™ne's work was inspired by the works of the great 17th-century landscape designer Andr√© Le N√¥tre, whose most famous creations included the gardens at the Palace of Versailles, Vaux- le-Vicomte and the Jardins des Tuileries. In his original, ambitious design for Carolands, Duch√™ne planned miles of roadways leading across extensive grounds, landscaped with thousands of shrubs and trees, accented by fountains and statuary. Only a small portion of the scheme was ever built. =Construction= Soon after Harriett Carolan secured the land in 1912, Duch√™ne arrived in San Francisco to lay out the grand parterre gardens. In late 1913, Ernest Sanson began to design the house. His plans included a dry moat around two sides of the house, discreetly located to provide light and air, and access, to the service spaces in the basement, while not blocking views of the gardens from the principal rooms on the main floor. In his design, Sanson incorporated three 18th-century period rooms that Carolan had purchased in Paris with the advice of the famous antique dealer Boni de Castellane. In 1914, Willis Polk began grading the great terraces planned by Duch√™ne, sending progress photographs to the architects and to the owners. Polk began to build the reinforced concrete superstructure he had designed, creating the infill walls with brick, finishing them with concrete stucco, sanded and scored to resemble natural limestone. The Dining Room, photographed by Jack E. Boucher for HABS in August 1974 In mid-1916, the elaborate interior elements began arriving on the site. The house as completed had ninety-eight rooms, including nine bedrooms and baths for the owners and their guests, each with an antechamber to guarantee quiet and privacy. The service spaces were equally elaborate: a kitchen with walls and ceiling made of white glass tiles; a service elevator connecting all floors; and a butler's pantry and mezzanine with walls of Delftware tile. In the fall of 1916, Harriett and Frank Carolan moved in with their staff. =First decline= Harriett Carolan did not use her house for long: she separated from Frank Carolan in 1917 and closed the chateau the following year. After the separation, she moved to New York City, while Frank remained in California where he died in 1923. Two years later, Harriett married Col. Arthur Schermerhorn, and while the couple occasionally occupied Carolands, in 1928 Harriett removed her furniture and put the property up for sale. The U.S. Government considered buying Carolands to use as a Western White House in 1939, and again during the Kennedy administration, but both times declined to purchase. In 1945, Tomlinson Moseley bought the house and surrounding 550 acres (2.2 km¬≤) from the Schermerhorns and began to sub-divide the land and build additional houses. In 1947, Life Magazine published an article about a charity event held at the house, the first opportunity for San Francisco-area residents to see its interior. According to the article, the house had been abandoned for twenty-five years, so that plumbing for the event had to be provided by a fire hose, and lighting required the use of portable generators and flood lights. Grand Staircase (from first level), by Boucher for HABS in Aug 1974 In 1948, Moseley sold the property, by then reduced to , to Mrs. S. Coe Robinson. By 1950, she had carved off much of the remaining land into smaller parcels and begun to contemplate demolishing the house. =Countess Lillian Remillard Dandini= Countess Lillian Remillard Dandini purchased Carolands Chateau in 1950, saving it from demolition by speculators interested in developing the land, and uninterested in the house's architectural significance. Prior to her marriage in 1932 to Mexican-born Count Alessandro Dandini di Cesena, Lillian Remillard was an heir to the Remillard Brothers fortune, which derived from a brick manufacturing business dating back to California's gold rush, a business that benefitted greatly from the construction boom following the 1906 earthquake. During the twenty-three years (until her death) that she lived at Carolands, the countess entertained often and made the house available for numerous charity benefits. She frequently invited San Francisco's French community to the house and opened it annually to the San Francisco Bay area's French students. Her generosity in sharing the house inspired the Town of Burlingame to give her the town's \\"Woman of the Year\\" award. In her later years the Countess Dandini lacked the necessary funds to maintain the house, and after she died in 1973 it was once again at risk of demolition. The countess willed the house and the remaining to the Town of Hillsborough to be used as a French and Italian musical, artistic and literary center, but was unable to include an endowment. The Town of Hillsborough declined the gift, ruling the proposed use inconsistent with the town's charter while noting it could not afford to pay the cost to maintain the property. =Years of decline= In 1975, the house was added to the list of California Historical Landmarks (CHL #886), and to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP #75000478). Nevertheless, Carolands suffered from frequent changes in ownership after Countess Dandini's death. In 1976, Dr. Selwyn McCabe won the house in a probate auction, but declined to purchase, deferring to the next bidder, Rose 'Roz' Franks. In 1979, Franks lost the house to George I. Benny, who in turn lost it to foreclosure in 1982, after conviction for conspiring to defraud institutional lenders. At the time, adult filmmakers gained access to the site where they produced the 1982 film All American Girls. During these years, Carolands was often vacant, and curious local high school students often entered the house. In 1985, David Allen Raley, a security guard, lured two high school students onto the property where he sexually assaulted and stabbed them, leaving them for dead in a ravine near San Jose. They managed to climb out of the ravine and flag down a passing motorist for help, but one later died of wounds received during the ordeal. Raley had bragged earlier that day that he often received bribes from curious students interested in the mansion's interior, but that \\"he only let girls in.\\" He was convicted, and received the death penalty in 1988. In 1986, Michael DeDomenico, an heir to the family controlling Rice-a-Roni and Ghirardelli, bought Carolands, and that year developers commissioned an Environmental Impact Report in support of a proposal to further subdivide the land and build additional houses. In 1989, the house suffered superficial damage in the Loma Prieta earthquake leading its owners to consider demolishing it. In 1997, a new owner proposed carving the house into fifteen condominiums, but the Hillsborough town charter banned multi-family residences. =Restoration= In 1991, the Hillsborough Designer Showhouse was held at Carolands, attracting 68,000 visitors, each paying $20 admission, netting more than $1 million for the sponsoring charity and reviving interest in the house. Among the visitors were Dr. Ann Johnson, who would later buy Carolands, and her interior decorator, Mario Buatta, who would help her to restore it. In 1998, Johnson and her husband, Charles Bartlett Johnson, bought the house and the remaining land for under $6 million. Dr. Johnson undertook extensive renovations: repairing the mechanical systems; removing asbestos; replacing the roof; and meticulously restoring the interior finishes, to bring the house back as much as possible to its original condition. Like the Countess Dandini, the Johnsons often shared the house for charity fundraisers and other worthy causes. Their primary purpose in purchasing and renovating Carolands was to preserve it for future decades. =Current status= In 2012, the Johnsons donated the house to Carolands Foundation, which conducts small group tours without charge, as described at their website.

The film stars Bill Allen as Cru Jones, a young BMX aggressive racer, alongside Lori Loughlin and Talia Shire. Plot The film's story focuses on Cru Jones (Bill Allen), a young BMX racer who lives in a small town with his mother (Talia Shire) and sister. Cru is faced with a tough decision: qualify for Helltrack or take the SAT in order to attend college. Winning Helltrack means $100,000, a new Chevrolet Corvette, and fame. Cru chooses the former option, ignoring his mother's wishes. The Helltrack race is endorsed by the city and a duplicitous Duke Best (Jack Weston), president of The Federation of American Bicyclists and owner of Mongoose bicycles. Best keeps adjusting the rules in order to keep Cru out of the race and to ensure BMX star Bart Taylor (1984 Olympic gymnastics champion Bart Conner) has an easy road to victory, thus providing a financial windfall for Mongoose Racing, Bart's sponsor. Racers from all around come to the small town for the Helltrack and Cru meets Christian Hollings (Lori Loughlin), who becomes Cru's romantic interest. Christian and Cru meet at the local high school dance where, instead of dancing like the other couples, they perform freestyle bike stunts on the dance floor to the awe of many. After being blocked from the race due to a last minute rule change on participant sponsorship, Cru is ready to give up his dreams of winning Helltrack, until his younger sister Wesley (Laura Jacoby) gives him a shirt to wear at Helltrack reading \\"Cru is... RAD.\\" Cru and his friends then come up with an idea for him to still enter the race. Using the $10,000 Cru won from qualifying, they start up \\"Rad Racing,\\" a small T-shirt business. However; days before the race Best changes the rules yet again claiming any company sponsoring a racer must be worth $50,000. When the towns people hear about this they rally around Cru and his friends and with their contributions along with a generous donation from a wealthy local, Mr. Timmer (Ray Walston) Rad Racing comes up with enough money and Jones is finally able to enter Helltrack. During Helltrack, Duke Best gets the Reynolds twins to try to take out Cru, to no avail. In the final lap, Bart, who leads the race, slows down so that he and Cru can face each other one-on-one in the final stretch. Cru ultimately wins Helltrack, and Bart Taylor is kicked off the Mongoose team. In the final scene Cru offers Taylor a spot in Rad Racing.

Reception The film was universally panned and under-performed commercially during its release. The New York Times stated \\"Teen-age ears may not split from the music or ache from the dialogue, but anybody over 20, beware: 'You're willing to sacrifice a solid future for a bicycle race,' says the hero's mother. 'It's very self-destructive.' If only he had listened to mom ‚Äì but who can blame him for preferring his bicycle?\\" On the website Rotten Tomatoes, \\"Rad\\" was given an approval rating of 40%, based on reviews from 10 critics. In 2013, The Guardian writer Nick Evershed found it had the largest discrepancy between critical and audience response (which at that time was 0% based on 5 reviews, versus 91%, based on 7,165 user ratings) in the Rotten Tomatoes database, from a pool of 10,000 movies analyzed. Film historian Leonard Maltin gave the movie a \\"BOMB\\" citation - the lowest possible rating in his TV, Movie & Video Guide - explaining, \\"Title is supposed to be short for Radical...as in, 'Radical, man!' Yeah, right...and we didn't see this same plotline used to death by 1950's hot-rod films, as well as 1970's roller-disco epics!\\" Home Video Releases The film was released on VHS and LaserDisc in 1986, where the film quickly found a following and became a top-ten video rental for two years after the film's release.

He was considered as the first Lombard king to have adopted some level of \\"Roman-ness\\" and introduced policies that led to drastic changes particularly in the treatment of the Romans and Christianity.  Rule  Authari was the son of Cleph, King of the Lombards. When the latter died in 574, the Lombard nobility refused to appoint a successor, resulting in a ten-years-long interregnum known as the Rule of the Dukes. In 574 and 575 the Lombards invaded Provence, then part of the kingdom of Burgundy of the Merovingian Guntram. The latter, in alliance with his nephew, the king of Austrasia Childebert II, replied by invading Northern Italy. The Austrasian army descended the valley of the Adige and took Trent. The Byzantine emperor, Tiberius II, began to negotiate an alliance with the Franks, and so the Lombards, fearful of a pincer movement, elected another king. In 584, they elected Duke Authari and ceded him the capital of Pavia as well as half of their ducal domains as a demesne. He spent his entire reign in wars with the Franks, the Byzantines, and Lombard rebels. His first major test was the quashing of the rebel duke Droctulf of Brescello, who had allied with the Romans and was ruling the Po valley. Having expelled him, he spent most of the rest of his six years on the throne fighting the exarch of Ravenna, Smaragdus, or the Merovingian kings. Guntram and Childebert were still not satisfied with their successes in Italy and they many times threatened invasion, following through on their threats twice. The memory of Theudebert I of Austrasia's campaigns in Italy, the urging of Childebert's warlike mother Brunhilda and the Byzantine emperor and exarch, as well as the wrongs done Guntram in the past undoubtedly fueled their quarrelsomeness. In 588, Authari defeated them handily, but in 590, the uncle and nephew led two armies across the Alps, respectively over Mont Cenis and the Brenner to Milan and Verona. Though Authari shut himself up in Pavia, the Franks accomplished little as the exarch's army did not meet them and they could not even join up with each other. Pestilence and the Breach at Cucca flood turned them around and they left the Lombards much chastened, but hardly defeated. Authari, when not controlled by foreign armies, expanded the Lombard dominion at the expense of Byzantium. He took the fortress of Comacchio and cut off communication between Padua and Ravenna. Faroald, duke of Spoleto, captured the Ravennan seaport of Classis and utterly devastated it. Authari swept through the peninsula all the way to Reggio, vowing to take Calabria -- a vow never to be kept by any Lombard. Authari married Theodelinda, daughter of the Bavarian duke Garibald I, on 15 May 589 at Verona. A Catholic, she had great influence among the Lombards for her virtue. A detailed account of the courtship by the eighth- century historian Paul the Deacon revealed that the marriage was also a political alliance designed to provide additional sanction to Authari's royal position. In addition, Theodelinda was also chosen due to the long-standing ties between the Lombards and the Bavarians as well as their mutual hostility toward the Franks. She also claimed descent from the ancient Lombard royal line. When Authari died in Pavia in 590, possibly by poison, he was succeeded as king by Agilulf, duke of Turin, on the advice, sought by the dukes, of Theodelinda, who married the new king.

It is available as free software under a revised BSD-style license. In 2005, Gavare changed the name of the software project from mips64emul to GXemul. This was to avoid giving the impression that the emulator was confined to the MIPS architecture, which was the only architecture being emulated initially. Although development of the emulator is still a work-in-progress, since 2004 it has been stable enough to let various unmodified guest operating systems run as if they were running on real hardware. Currently emulated processor architectures include ARM, MIPS, M88K, PowerPC, and SuperH. Guest operating systems that have been verified to work inside the emulator are NetBSD, OpenBSD, Linux, HelenOS, Ultrix, and Sprite. Apart from running entire guest operating systems, the emulator can also be used for experiments on a smaller scale, such as hobby operating system development, or it can be used as a general debugger.  Dynamic translation  GXemul's processor emulation uses dynamic translation, to convert the emulated processor's instructions into an intermediate representation (IR). The IR is in a format which can be executed by the host. In other words, it should be possible to port the emulator to new host architectures with just a recompilation; there is no need to implement a native code generation backend for each host architecture to get it running.  Usage example  Assuming you have downloaded a NetBSD/pmax 5.0 CD-ROM ISO image (pmaxcd-5.0.iso), the following commands will let you install NetBSD onto an emulated DECstation 5000 Model 200 (also known as \\"3max\\"): dd if=/dev/zero of=nbsd_pmax.img bs=1024 count=1 seek=3000000 gxemul -e 3max -d nbsd_pmax.img -d b:pmaxcd-5.0.iso The first command () creates an empty disk image, and the second command launches GXemul. The option specifies the machine to emulate, and the options add disk images. The first disk image is the newly created disk image where NetBSD will be installed. The second is the CD-ROM ISO image; the modifier flag means that the system should boot from the ISO image, instead of the first available disk image. Installing NetBSD within the emulator should be very similar to installing it on real hardware. Once the installation has completed, the following command should start NetBSD from the disk image: gxemul -e 3max -d nbsd_pmax.img  See also  * QEMU * SIMH * PearPC * Bochs * Comparison of platform virtualization software  External links  * The GXemul homepage * NetBSD's Emulator page Free emulation software Multi-emulators PowerPC emulators ","title":"GXemul"},{"id":"1363685","text":"Avraham Yeshaya Karelitz (7 November 1878 - 24 October 1953), known by the name of his magnum opus, Chazon Ish, was a Belarusian born Orthodox rabbi who later became one of the leaders of Haredi Judaism in Israel, where he spent his final 20 years, from 1933 to 1953. Biography Avraham Yeshaya Karelitz was born in Kosava, in the Grodno Governorate of the Russian Empire (now Brest Region, Belarus), the eldest son of Shmaryahu Yosef Karelitz, the rabbi of Kosava; his mother was Rasha Leah, the daughter of Shaul Katzenelbogen.Shdeour, E. \\"Harav Yitzchak Karelitz of Kosova, Hy\\"d\\". Hamodia, 12 January 2012, p. C2. Avraham Yeshaya was born after his older brother Meir. His younger brothers were Yitzchak, and Moshe. Yitzchak succeeded their father as the rabbi of Kosava; he and his wife and daughter were shot to death in their home by the Germans in mid-1942. His oldest sisters were Henya Chaya, Badana, Tzivia and Batya. Karelitz's youngest sister, Pesha Miriam (Miril) married Yaakov Yisrael Kanievsky. Kanievsky referred to his brother-in-law Avraham Yeshaya as his mentor as long as the latter was alive. As a youth, Karelitz was sent to study under Chaim Soloveitchik of Brisk. He did not take to the Brisker method of study, and later it became clear that he actually opposed it. After two years, he returned home and continued to study with his father who was head of the local Beth din. He married Bashe Bei of Kvƒódarnahttp://www.karelitzfamily.com/ and developed a close relationship with Moshe Rosen (Nezer HaKodesh). He moved to Vilna in about 1920, and became close to Chaim Ozer Grodzinski, consulting with him in all religious and communal matters. Encouraged by Grodzinski and with Abraham Isaac Kook‚Äôs help, Karelitz settled in Eretz Israel, then the British Mandate of Palestine, in 1933. His house in Bnei Brak became the address for thousands who sought religious guidance. Karelitz, his brother-in-law Kanievsky and Yaakov Galinsky were extremely close. \\"Rav Galinsky was extremely close to the Chazon Ish and the Steipler Gaon\\" Karelitz devoted his life to the study of Torah while simultaneously gaining knowledge in secular sciences such as astronomy, anatomy, mathematics, and botany. After his marriage, he continued to lead an extremely modest life, his wife providing for their needs while he spent day and night studying Torah in-depth. He did not have any children. Influence and authority Karelitz did not publish many responsa, yet still achieved recognition as a leading authority on halakha. Like his brother-in-law Kanievsky, Karelitz \\"held no official position but nevertheless became a recognized worldwide authority on many matters relating to Jewish law and life.\\" He declined to participate in any of the religious-political movements which were very active prior to, and during, the formation of the State of Israel in 1948. Yet, he had an immense influence on Haredi Judaism in Israel, whose formative period coincided with his years in Israel. He maintained an anti-Zionist viewpoint and begrudgingly accepted the existence of the Israeli state. In recognition of his deep insight and interest in many fields of study, many sought his guidance on social and political issues. David Ben- Gurion, the prime minister of Israel, and Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, who became the second president of Israel, visited him once to discuss political-religious issues. Karelitz cited one of a pair of metaphors from the Talmudic discussion (Sanhedrin 32b): one is about two camels which meet on a narrow mountain pass as a metaphor. A camel without goods was expected to defer to a camel laden with goods; similarly, Karelitz contended secular society should defer to religious society, which bore the \\"goods\\" of tradition. Chazon Ish etrog There is a variety of Balady citron in his name, which he certified for use as an etrog of the four species. After one Sukkot, Karelitz handed Michel Yehuda Lefkowitz a packet of seeds taken from the etrog he had used for the festival and instructed him to plant them in his yard. Lefkowitz, who had no agricultural experience, followed his mentor's instructions to plant and water it, and the tree grew and bore fruit. Every year Karelitz came to select his etrog for the holiday from the tree, as did his brother-in-law, Kanievsky, and other senior rabbis. Lefkowitz also allowed etrog growers to take cuttings from the tree to grow entire orchards of etrogim certified as kosher by Karelitz.Freund, Rabbi Tuvia. \\"The Tradition of Chazon Ish Esrogim\\". Hamodia Sukkos Torah Supplement, 21 September 2010, p. 9. Halachic and philosophical positions He believed that a halachic position taken by the Shulchan Aruch could not be reversed based on the new discovery of manuscripts of which the Shulchan Aruch's author was presumably unaware. This position is sometimes misunderstood to mean that no evidence from manuscripts may be used in the halachic process.The role of manuscripts in halakhic decision-making: Hazon Ish, his precursors and contemporaries Published works In 1911, he published his first work on Orach Chayim and other parts of the Shulchan Aruch in Vilna, anonymously under the title Chazon Ish, meaning \\"Vision of a man\\", with the word Ish alluding to the first letters of his two names (◊ê◊ë◊®◊î◊ù ◊ô◊©◊¢◊ô◊î), similar to Yaakov Emden's pen-name \\"Yaavetz\\".A book about his sister Batya's life: In later years, he became almost exclusively known by the title Chazon Ish. Although essentially an academic scholar, he applied himself to practical problems, devoting much effort to the strengthening of religious life and institutions. His rulings on the use of the milking machine on Shabbat and on cultivation by hydroponics during the sabbatical year are two illustrations of his practical approach. Karelitz wrote over 40 books in Hebrew. In contrast to other great achronim such as Chaim Soloveitchik, Karelitz is known for avoiding formulaic or methodical analysis of Talmudic passages, instead preferring a more varied and intuitive approach similar to that of the rishonim. Karelitz also discounted the need to delve into musar as a formal study, feeling that a life dedicated to traditional Torah study would guide one toward the proper path. He particularly rejected elements of the Novardok philosophy, such as their extreme self-effacement and anti-social behaviors. In one of his regular lectures, Aharon Leib Steinman spoke about studying Kabbalah, and related that Karelitz had vast knowledge in Kabbalah. Karelitz studied with a secret kabbalist known as \\"The Baker of Kosovo.\\"House of Nobility, Humble Abode: Rav Elyashiv and His Torah Dynasty by Nosson Weiss. Mishpacha Magazine Issue 159 May 23, 2007 A fictionalized portrait of Karelitz by his onetime disciple, the Yiddish poet and novelist Chaim Grade, is to be found in Grade's epic novel Tsemakh Atlas: Di Yeshive',New York & Los Angeles: Yiddish Natzyonaln Arbeiter Farband, 1967-1968, two volumes translated into English as The Yeshiva.[Curt Leviant, tr.] (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1976-1977, two volumes. Karelitz appears there as \\"Reb Avraham-Shaye Kosover.\\" A number of multi-volume biographies have been published about Karelitz, including Pe'er Hador, and the more recent Maaseh Ish, both in Hebrew. A 1,000-page academic biography of Karelitz by Benny Brown was published by Magnes Press in 2011. The contents of this academic biography were subsequently debated by Brown and Joshua Envel in the journal Yeshurun, Vol. 30.http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=56832&st;=&pgnum;=863 In the following edition of Yeshurun, Vol. 31, Envel presented his own hypothesis how to systematically conceptualize the methodology of Karelitz.http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=56833&st;=&pgnum;=814 Envel's approach was then the subject of correspondence with several readers in Yeshurun, Vol. 32.http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=57770&st;=&pgnum;=938 More recently, a chapter from Brown's book was translated and published in ·∏§akirah, Vol. 24.The Gaon of Vilna, the ·∏§atam Sofer, and the ·∏§azon Ish: Minhag and the Crisis of Modernity References  Further reading  * Chazon Ish.

They had seven children: #John Casimir (25 December 1607 ‚Äì 14 January 1608). #John Casimir (22 March 1609 ‚Äì 16 December 1672), who reigned during 1648‚Äì1668 as John II Casimir. #John Albert (25 June 1612 ‚Äì 29 December 1634). #Charles Ferdinand (13 October 1613 ‚Äì 9 May 1655). #Alexander Charles (4 November 1614 ‚Äì 19 November 1634). #Anna Constance (26 January 1616 ‚Äì 24 May 1616). #Anna Catherine Constance (7 August 1619 ‚Äì 8 October 1651). Queen Constance was an ambitious politician. Immediately after the wedding, she made efforts to influence policy. She built a strong faction of followers by arranging marriages between her handmaidens and powerful nobles. She represented the interests of the Habsburg family in Poland, and influenced the appointments of positions in the court, government and church. Her closest confidant was Urszula Meyerin. Constance was proficient in Spanish, Latin and Italian. She learned Polish after the wedding but rarely used it. She was very religious and went to Mass twice a day. She also was a patron of clerics, painters and architects. She financed the buildings of several palaces for her children, but she was also described as an economic person.

He was a member of the Australian House of Representatives, representing the Division of Isaacs, from 1996 until his suicide at the age of 44. He is the only serving member of the House of Representatives to have committed suicide.  Early life  Wilton was born in Melbourne, raised in suburban Chelsea and studied at Monash University, where he obtained a Bachelor of Science. Later, he went on to study at the London School of Economics. Wilton spent most of 1980‚Äì81 touring and making friends in North America. He worked as an industrial officer for most of his working career, with the Australian Services Union, National Union of Workers and Association of Professional Engineers, Scientists and Managers, Australia, resigning from the latter upon his election to parliament in 1996.  Political life  Wilton was also active in politics for many years, having joined the Australian Labor Party in 1982. He served as the president and secretary of his local branch from 1982 until 1984, and as a delegate to the party's state conference from 1984 to 1992. He won pre-selection to contest the Liberal-held marginal seat of Isaacs in the leadup to the 1996 election. Though his party lost government at the election, Wilton won the seat, aided by boundary changes which turned it into a marginal Labor seat, defeating sitting member Rod Atkinson. He remained on the backbenches once in parliament, and served on the Financial Institutions and Public Administration Committee for all of his four years in parliament. Wilton became a very well known and highly regarded local MP, although he was not a major player on the national stage. Wilton is still regarded as one of Labor's most effective marginal seat campaigners. He gave away most of his electorate allowance by buying bicycles for school- children in his seat of Isaacs. He believed in \\"constant campaigning\\" which led him to conduct \\"mobile offices\\" very frequently throughout his electorate to ensure that constituents could contact him at all times.  Final days  Wilton's marriage broke down in early 2000, and rumours began to surface that he would soon resign. Then Wilton was found by police, distressed in a car with his two young children in the You Yangs, near Geelong as he was driving out of the national park. While the circumstances of the incident were never clear ‚Äì fellow MP Kelvin Thomson said that Wilton had told him that he would never have harmed his children ‚Äì it was reported by the media as an attempted murder-suicide. The Sunday Herald Sun ran the headline \\"FEDERAL MP ARRESTED\\", and full pages were dedicated to coverage of the incident. The day before Wilton's death, The Australian newspaper ran an editorial suggesting that it was \\"increasingly certain\\" that Wilton would resign, and speculating about possible replacements. Around this time, former Victorian Premier and depression campaigner Jeff Kennett spoke out against the media's coverage, stating that he was \\"angry at the manner in which this matter was previously reported and which was the cause of further subjecting this young man to national humiliation in the way the media covered his depressive condition.\\" In the aftermath of the incident and media coverage, Wilton spent a fortnight in psychiatric care.  Death  On 14 June 2000, Wilton took his own life in a national park near the town of Labertouche, in the Shire of Buln Buln. His death sparked a major reaction, with the media, the Labor Party, and the family law and mental health systems all coming in for some blame in the ensuing days. Many also pointed to the Australian political tradition of voluble, even personal, politics. The Australian Press Council came under fire for not having guidelines as to the reporting of attempted suicide. Several condolence motions were passed through parliament from political allies such as Anna Burke and from Opposition MPs such as Kay Hull. An entire parliamentary day was set aside for condolence speeches. Members of Parliament wept openly in the House chamber as they spoke of their memories of Greg Wilton and their grief about his death. Wilton's seat was filled by the Australian Labor Party's Ann Corcoran at a by-election on 12 August 2000.

It is not the same as Malayalam poetry although most of it is poetry driven. Kerala has a rich tradition in Carnatic music. Songs formed a major part of early Malayalam literature, which traces its origin to the 9th century CE. The significance of music in the culture of Kerala can be established just by the fact that in Malayalam language, musical poetry was developed long before prose. With the development of music in the region, different branches were formed out of it. The most basic branches are classical music which is primarily Carnatic music oriented, and popular music which includes film songs and album songs. History The earliest written record of Malayalam is the Edakal - 5 inscription (ca. 4th Century CE). The early literature of Malayalam comprised three types of composition: *Classical songs known as Naadan Paattu *Manipravalam of the Sanskrit tradition, which permitted a generous interspersing of Sanskrit with Malayalam *The folk song rich in native elements Malayalam poetry to the late 20th century CE It is very unuseful data. varying degrees of the fusion of the three different strands. The oldest examples of Pattu and, are Ramacharitam and Vaishikatantram, both of the twelfth century. Classical music Kerala is musically known for Sopana Sangeetham. Sopana Sangeetham is a form of classical music that originated in the temples of Kerala. Sopanam is religious in nature, and developed through singing invocatory songs at the Kalam of Kali, and later inside temples. Sopanam came to prominence in the wake of the increasing popularity of Jayadeva's Gita Govinda or Ashtapadis. Sopana sangeetham (music), as the very name suggests, is sung by the side of the holy steps (sopanam) leading to the sanctum sanctorum of a shrine. It is sung, typically employing plain notes, to the accompaniment of the small, hourglass- shaped ethnic drum called idakka, besides the chengila or the handy metallic gong to sound the beats. Sopanam is traditionally sung by men of the Marar and Pothuval community, who are Ambalavasi (semi-Brahmin) castes engaged to do it as their hereditary profession. Some famous sopanam singers are Neralattu Rama Poduval, Janardhanan Nedungadi and Damodara Marar. Kerala is also home of Carnatic music. Legends like Swati Tirunal, Irayimman Thampi, Shadkala Govinda Marar, Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavatar, K. J. Yesudas, K.G Jayan (Jayavijaya), Palghat Mani Iyer, Vidwan Gopala Pillai, Chertala Gopalan Nair, M. D. Ramanathan, T. V. Gopalakrishnan, M. K. Sankaran Namboothiri, Mavelikara Krishnankutty Nair, Neyyattinkara Vasudevan, T. N. Krishnan, T S Nandakumar are renowned musical exponents from Kerala. Among the younger generation, child prodigy violin wizard L.Athira Krishna and Carnatic vocalist P. Unnikrishnan have made their musical impact in the international arena, thus keeping the regal tradition of Carnatic music alive. Kerala also has a significant presence of Hindustani music as well. The king of Travancore, Swathi Thirunal patronaged and contributed much to the Hindustani Music. Popular music Popular music of Kerala had a linear development along with classical music of the region, till the branches separated. The popular music in Kerala is enriched by its highly developed film music branch. Other forms of popular music include light music, pop music and devotional songs. =Kathakali Music= The language of the songs used for Kathakali is Manipravalam, a mixture of Malayalam and Sanskrit. Even though most of the songs are set in ragas based on the microtone-heavy Carnatic music, there is a distinct style of plain-note rendition, which is known as the Sopanam style. This typically Kerala style of rendition takes its roots from the temple songs which used to be sung (continues even now at several temples) at the time when Kathakali was born.The foremost artist was Kalamandalam Krishnan Nair. Kalamandalam at Vallathol Nagar, near Shornur,Trissur in Kerala is an important training center for this art. Since Kathakali is essentially a temple art one of the greatest ever Kathakali singer, Hyderali, who was a Muslim, had to face stiff resistance which eventually was swept away by the immense force of popularity. But Hyderali softened the original Asura nature of the art. Kalamandalam Gangadharan, who remains the last exponent of the original tradition has almost retired from the scene. kathakali was so entertaining. =Malayalam film music= Film music, which refers to playback singing in the context of Indian music, forms the most important canon of popular music in India. The film music of Kerala in particular is the most popular form of music in the state. Before Malayalam cinema and Malayalam film music developed, the Keralites eagerly followed Tamil and Hindi film songs, and that habit has stayed with them till now. The history of Malayalam film songs begins with the 1948 film Nirmala which was produced by Artist P.J. Cherian who introduced play-back singing for the first time in the film. The film's music composer was P. S. Divakar, and the songs were sung by P. Leela, T. K. Govinda Rao, Vasudeva Kurup, C. K. Raghavan, Sarojini Menon and Vimala B. Varma, who is credited as the first playback singer of Malayalam cinema. The main trend in the early years was to use the tune of hit Hindi or Tamil songs in Malayalam songs. This trend changed in the early 1950s with the arrival of a number of poets and musicians to the Malayalam music scene. But by the mid of 1950s, Malayalam Film Music Industry started finding its own identity and this reformation was led by the music directors Brother Laxmanan, G. Devarajan, V. Dakshinamurthy, M.S. Babu Raj and K. Raghavan along with the lyricists Vayalar Rama Varma, P. Bhaskaran, O. N. V. Kurup and Sreekumaran Thampi. Major playback singers of that time were Kamukara Purushothaman, K. P. Udayabhanu, A. M. Raja, P. Leela, Santha P. Nair, P. Susheela, P. Madhuri and S. Janaki. Despite that, these singers got high popularity throughout Kerala and were part of the Golden age of Malayalam music (1960 to 1970). In the later years many non-Malayalis like Manna Dey, Talat Mahmood, Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle, Hemalata and S. P. Balasubrahmanyam sang for Malayalam films. This trend was also found among composers to an extent, with film composers from other languages including Naushad Ali, Usha Khanna, M. B. Sreenivasan, Bombay Ravi, Shyam, Bappi Lahiri, Laxmikant‚ÄìPyarelal, Salil Chowdhury, Ilaiyaraaja, Vishal Bhardwaj and A. R. Rahman scoring music for Malayalam films. This can be attributed to the fact that film music in South India had a parallel growth pattern with so many instances of cross-industry contributions.. The late 1950s through mid 1970s can be considered as the golden period of Malayalam film music in its own identity. Along with the leading music directors, likes of M. B. Sreenivasan, M. K. Arjunan, Pukezhenty Vellappan Nair, M. S. Viswanathan, A. T. Ummer, R. K. Shekhar, Salil Choudhury and lyricists like Thirunainar Kurichi Madhavan Nair, Mankombu Gopalakrishnan and Bharanikkavu Sivakumar, numerous everlasting and super hit songs were delivered to the music lovers. The soft melodious music and high quality lyrics were the highlights of these songs. K. J. Yesudas, who debuted in 1961, and P. Jayachandran virtually revolutionised the Malayalam film music industry and became the most popular Malayalam singer ever along with K.S. Chitra. Vayalar, G. Devarajan and Yesudas trio also made unforgettable songs like the earlier trio of Kamukara, Tirunainaarkurichy & Brother Laxmanan. Yesudas became equally popular with classical music audience and people who patronised film music. He along with P. Jayachandran gave a major facelift to Malayalam playback singing in the 1960s and 1970s. K. S. Chithra, who debuted in 1979.By the mid-eighties, she became the most sought after female singer in South India. By Late 1970s, the trends in music started changing and more rhythm oriented songs with western touch came with the dominance of music directors like Shyam, K. J. Joy, Jerry Amaldev etc. The lyricists were forced to write lyrics according to the tune in these days and were often criticized for quality issues. But from 1979‚Äì80, the revolutionary music director Raveendran along with Johnson and M. G. Radhakrishnan lead the second reformation of Malayalam film music by creating melodious and classical oriented music with the soul of culture of Kerala. Lyricists like Poovachal Khader, Kavalam Narayana Panicker and Bichu Thirumala in 1980s and Kaithapram Damodaran Namboothiri, Gireesh Puthenchery in 1990s were part of this musical success. Contributions from Kannur Rajan, Bombay Ravi, S. P. Venkatesh, Mohan Sithara, Ouseppachan, Sharath, Vidyadharan, Raghukumar and Vidyasagar were also notable in this period. Along with K. J. Yesudas and K. S. Chitra and singers like M. G. Sreekumar, G. Venugopal Unnimenon and Sujatha Mohan were also active then. A notable aspect in the later years was the extensive of classical carnatic music in many film songs of the 1980s and 1990s, classical carnatic music was heavily used in films like Chithram (1988), His Highness Abdullah (1990), Bharatham (1991), Sargam (1992) and Sopanam (1993). At present, the major players in the scene are young composers like Rahul Raj, Prashant Pillai, Shaan Rahman, Bijibal, Gopi Sundar, Alphonse, Rajesh Murugesan, lyricists Rafeeq Ahmed, Vayalar Sarath and Anil Panachooran, and singers Vineeth Sreenivasan, Vijay Yesudas, Shweta Mohan, Manjari and Jyotsna Radhakrishnan, along with stalwarts in the field. Young composers like Rahul Raj, Abhijith P. S. Nair and Prashant Pillai are not only known for their catchy tunes, but also known for bringing in a lot of electronics, digital sound and a variety of genres in Malayalam film scores and songs.CONTRIBUTE ARTICLES/REVIEWS - The healing power of Music &n; .

The stream consists of a variety of forms like gazals and mappila pattu, and also music for authentic Muslim dance forms such as oppana and kol kali. The poetry forms a main part of this stream of music, which is primarily in Malayalam with the use of Arabic words in between which is known as arabimalayalam. Mappila songs have a charm of their own as their tunes sound a mix of the ethos and culture of Kerala as well as West Asia. They deal with diverse themes such as religion, love, satire and heroism. =Knanaya Folk Songs= Palm Leaf Relics of Knanaya Folk Songs The Knanaya, an ethnic group found among the St. Thomas Christians, maintain folk songs that are ancient in origins and were first written down in the year 1910 by the Knanaya scholar P.U Luke in his text Puratana Pattukal or Ancient Songs. The origins of the songs themselves are unknown but were collected by Luke from Knanaya families who kept palm leaf relics which contained the text of these songs. The songs were written in Old Malayalam but contain diction from Sanskrit, Syriac, and Tamil indicating their antiquity. Analytically, these ancient songs contain folklore about the faith, customs and practices of the community, narratives of historical events (such as the mission of St. Thomas the Apostle and the immigration of the Knanaya to India), biblical stories, songs of churches, and the lives of saints. The songs are poetic in nature and are considered treasures in Kerala's cultural heritage. Scholars have also found that the songs of the Knanaya are of a similar composure, linguistics, and characteristic to that of the Cochin Jews and that some songs even have almost the same lyrics with the exception of a few words or stanzas. =Ottamthullal Songs= Ottamthullal songs are meant for the performance of the artform called Ottamthullal. The Ottamthullal artist has to sing and dance to his music. Unlike in the case of Kathakali, the language is not heavy sanskritized Malayalam and the lyrics are set to rhythms that range from simple to rare and complicated.ottamthullal was usually played in temples. =Malayalam Pop music= Pop music in Kerala, developed in the later half of the 1990s with the entry of East Coast Vijayan and his music company East Coast Audios.

The department is headed by Her Majesty's Lord Advocate, who under the Scottish legal system is responsible for prosecution, along with the area procurators fiscal. In Scotland, virtually all prosecution of criminal offences is undertaken by the Crown. Private prosecutions are extremely rare. The Service's responsibilities extend to the whole of Scotland, and include: * Investigation and prosecution of criminal offences * Investigation of sudden or suspicious deaths * The investigation and prosecution of criminal conduct by the police * Assessment and possession of bona vacantia * Assessment and possession of treasure trove The Lord Advocate is assisted by the Solicitor General for Scotland, both Law Officers. The day- to-day running of the Service is done by the Crown Agent & Chief Executive and an executive board who are based in the service headquarters at Crown Office in Chambers Street, Edinburgh. The Service employs both civil servants who carry out administrative and other duties and solicitors and advocates who represent the Crown in Court. History The history of the Lord Advocate, and the resulting department of the Crown Office, is somewhat obscure. There are references on record to a king's procurator-fiscal in 1434 and 1457, and a queen's advocate in 1462. An office of king's advocate dates from 1478 but between 1478 and 1494 there are references to \\"advocates\\" (unnamed) and it is only from 1494 that one can be sure that there was a single king's advocate as the normal representative of the king in treason trials and in civil litigation. The office thus dates back to Medieval times, with the earliest Lord Advocate being John Ross of Montgrenan whom the King appointed as his commissioner at a hearing in Stirling in 1476, then as procurator for another case in Edinburgh in the following year. The history of the procurator fiscal is similarly difficult to set down with exactness, though the role has developed significantly over time. The first document reference appears in the Records of the Parliament of Scotland for 22 August 1584, naming several procurators fiscal in Edinburgh. The fiscal was an officer appointed by, and accountable to, the Sheriff, who by the 18th Century was responsible for most prosecutions in local areas. By the nineteenth century advocates depute were first appointed, to assist him in conducting cases in the High Court of Justiciary and the Crown Office was first established. This became the centre of the prosecution system, and it was to the Lord Advocate now to whom the procurators fiscal were responsible, evidenced by the \\"Book of Regulations\\" issued by him to procurators fiscal providing instructions about how to conduct their business. The Book of Regulations is still used today in providing the framework for local prosecution in Scotland. Prosecutors =The Lord Advocate and Solicitor General for Scotland= As well as departmental management responsibility, the Lord Advocate is directly responsible for prosecuting the most serious crimes, in the High Court of Justiciary at first instance and the Court of Criminal Appeal. Unless the cases are of especial importance, such as the Lockerbie trial held at Camp Zeist in the Netherlands, the prosecutions are normally (but not always) led by Advocates Depute who are known collectively as Crown Counsel and are experienced members of the Faculty of Advocates normally appointed for a limited period of three years. Their decision to prosecute in this way is taken in the light of the Procurator Fiscal's recommendations and a report prepared by the police, and any such reports are subject to the direction of the Lord Advocate.Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 (c.46) This prosecutorial role can not be removed from her by the Scottish Parliament. The Lord Advocate is the senior of the two Scottish Law Officers, and is the chief legal adviser to the Scottish Government as well as representing its ministers in civil proceedings.The role and functions of the Lord Advocate He is also responsible under the Scotland Act 1998 for ensuring that each Act of the Scottish Parliament is within the competence of that Parliament. Additionally, the Lord Advocate, along with the Solicitor General for Scotland are ex- officio entitled to participate (but not vote) in proceedings of the Scottish Parliament to the extent permitted by standing orders.Scotland Act 1998, section 27. The Solicitor General can act as the deputy for the Lord Advocate. The Lord Advocate and Solicitor General are one of the Great Officers of State in Scotland, and the Lord Advocate is one of the Scottish Ministers, though since 23 May 2007 the Lord Advocate has not attended the cabinet of the Scottish Government. The position of Lord Advocate has been the subject of controversy, most notably sparked by Scottish High Court judges, wanting the ministerial and prosecutorial role to be separated.Judges call for Lord Advocate to be stripped of powers, Sunday Herald, 1 November 2008 =Crown Agent, Queen's and Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer and Chief Executive= The Crown Agent is the principal legal adviser to the Lord Advocate on prosecution matters. He also acts as Chief Executive for the Department. He acts as solicitor in all legal proceedings in which the Lord Advocate appears as representing his or her own department. He issues general instructions from and on behalf of the Lord Advocate for the guidance of Crown counsel, procurators fiscal, sheriff clerks and other public officials, transmits instructions from Crown counsel to procurators fiscal about prosecutions, and, subject to the direction of the Principal Clerk of Justiciary, arranges sittings of the High Court of Justiciary. At trials in the High Court in Edinburgh, he attends as instructing solicitor. The Crown Agent also holds the office of Queen's and Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer, and all property that falls to the Crown as a result of bona vacantia in Scotland is his responsibility, as is treasure trove. The post of QLTR was created in 1837 by the amalgamation of two existing posts created in 1707 ‚Äì the King's/Queen's Remembrancer and the Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer, and has been held since 1981 by the holder of the office of Crown Agent. =Advocates depute= At the High Court of Justiciary prosecutions are brought by the Crown Office, who are represented in Court by Advocates Depute. Advocates Depute are either advocates or solicitor-advocates to whom rights of audience in the High Court have been given by that Court. =Procurators fiscal= For the majority of crimes in Scotland a procurator fiscal or fiscal depute presents the case for the prosecution in the sheriff court and justice of the peace courts, and the case for the defence is presented either by the accused's own solicitor or by one from the Public Defence Solicitors' Office, a part of the Scottish Legal Aid Board. Procurators fiscal make preliminary investigations into criminal cases, take written statements from witnesses (known as precognition) and are responsible for the investigation and prosecution of crime. This includes the power to direct the police in their investigation, but except for serious crimes such as murder the police normally complete their enquiries before involving the procurator fiscal.\\"When a crime is committed it is the responsibility of the Procurator Fiscal to investigate it.\\" Lord Justice Clerk Thomson Smith Procurator Fiscal ‚Äì \\"Powers\\". Once someone has been charged with an offence and remanded in custody, the Crown must bring the case to trial within 110 days or the accused will be admitted to bail. Otherwise, in serious cases (known as solemn procedure with a jury as opposed to summary procedure without) the trial must commence within 12 months of the date of first appearance in court. Procurators fiscal work in the local sheriffdom and most of the fiscal offices in Scotland are either in or near the sheriff court. The procurator fiscal is also responsible for the investigation of all sudden, suspicious and unexplained deaths in Scotland. This includes the decision to call a fatal accident inquiry. He or she is also responsible for the independent investigation of criminal police complaints made in that sherrifdom (administrative complaints are handled by the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (PIRC)). Prosecution of crimes The law in Scotland does not say that a crime must be prosecuted and the procurators fiscals have considerable discretion over what action to take. They can choose the level at which to prosecute (either through solemn or summary procedure) with the accused having no right to choose a jury trial or for a victim to decide whether or not to press charges, as the decision on whether to try and by which method belongs to the prosecutor as \\"Master of the Instance\\".p. 46 Until 1987, however, their discretion only extended to the degree to which they should prosecute, if at all; there were no alternatives to prosecution. The Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1987 gave procurators fiscal the power to offer fixed penalties instead of prosecution (a fiscal fine), at the time limited to a maximum of ¬£25 and subsequently increased to ¬£300.\\"Where a procurator fiscal receives a report that a relevant offence has been committed he may send to the alleged offender a notice under this section (referred to in this section as a conditional offer)\\"Conditional offer of fixed penalty by procurator fiscal\\" \\"Penalties as alternative to prosecution\\" Since then these options have expanded to giving a warning, fiscal fines, compensation orders, work orders, road traffic fixed penalties or diversion from prosecution into social work, psychological counselling or psychiatric treatment.Alternatives to prosecution: COPFS Federations COPFS is organised into three geographic Federations led by Procurators Fiscal for the North, East and West of Scotland. Within the federations, there is a network of 37 Procurator Fiscal offices (including the Crown Office). Victim Information and Advice Service Victim Information and Advice Service (VIA) is a dedicated and specialised victim information and advice service within the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. VIA was created to provide information to victims, bereaved next of kin and keeping them informed about the progress of a case. It also has a duty to advise on and facilitate referral to other agencies for specialist support and counselling as required. VIA works closely with other statutory agencies, such as the Police and the Courts and with voluntary organisations, such as Court Witness Service, Women's Aid and Victim Support, and is a unique service in the Scottish criminal justice system.

The Flight Surgeon Badge is worn by those members of the military who have completed the individual service requirements for award of the badge. The original Flight Surgeon Badges were awarded by both the Army and Navy during World War II. After WW II, when the USAF became a separate service, they retained the Army Air Force badge, but redesigned it with a smaller caduceus over the central shield (the present pattern). Concurrently, the Army badge was redesigned to the present pattern (along with all other Army Aviation badges). The Naval Flight Surgeon insignia has gone through several design iterations from the pre-World War II period, to during World War II, to the postwar period and present day. There is no separate Marine Corps Fight Surgeon insignia, as all medical personnel assigned to or supporting Marine Corps units are Navy personnel, and will thus be awarded and wear Navy insignia. The Coast Guard Flight Surgeon Badge is the same pattern as the USCG Aviator badge, but with a caduceus superimposed over the central shield. Unlike USN and USN medical support of USMC, USCG Flight Surgeons are commissioned corps officers of the U.S. Public Health Service. To be awarded the Army Basic Flight Surgeon Badge, a service member must be a commissioned officer who is either a physician, Physician Assistant, or ANP (the latter two as of 2011 per Army Regulation 600-8-22) and successfully complete the Army Flight Surgeon Primary Course (AFSPC) at Fort Rucker, Alabama. The AFSPC is a six-week course that includes topics in aviation physiology, Army aviation and aviation medicine regulations, accident investigation, military aviation operations, and aircraft orientations; for several years in the 1980s flight surgeon candidates received actual flight training up to, and including, solo flight in the TH-55 helicopter. A physician who has completed the AFSPC may later elect to apply for the Army Residency in Aerospace Medicine, although some highly qualified fourth year medical students may be selected to enter the program upon graduation. The Naval Flight Surgeon is conducted at the Naval Aerospace Medical Institute at NAS Pensacola, Florida. Its curriculum is similar to the Army program, but is 24 weeks in length and includes 10 weeks of flight indoctrination training in the T-6 Texan II, T-45 Goshawk and TH-57 SeaRanger. The Air Force program consists of three phases, Aerospace Medicine Primary 101, 201, and 202. The Air Force program, in addition to a core curriculum similar to the Army and Navy, includes such topics as Bioenvironmental Engineering and occupational health. Coast Guard flight surgeons generally attend the Army course followed by a two-week USCG transition course. The Army, Navy, and Air Force also offer residency programs in Aerospace Medicine, located at Fort Rucker, AL, NAS Pensacola, and Wright- Patterson AFB, respectively. The United States Army and United States Air Force issue the Flight Surgeon Badge in three ratings: Basic, Senior, and Master (Army)/Chief (Air Force). The Basic Flight Surgeon Badge is presented upon completion of initial flight surgeon qualifications, while the Senior and Master versions of the badge are presented based on years of service and number of flight hours performed as a flight surgeon. Per Army Regulation 600-105, the Army Senior Flight Surgeon Badge may be awarded after five years of duty as a flight surgeon (three if two years were as an Army Aviator) and 400 flight hours, while the Master version may be awarded after ten years of service as a flight surgeon, 850 flight hours, and board certification in Aerospace Medicine. The Senior Flight Surgeon badge is denoted by a star centered above the badge, while the Master and Chief Flight Surgeon badges display a star and wreath (Army) or star and scroll (USAF). USAF requirements for Senior and Chief badges are similar to the Army requirements. The United States Navy and Coast Guard issue Flight Surgeon Badges in a single degree. In addition to the Flight Surgeon Badge, the United States Navy and Air Force award the Flight Nurse Badge for those nurses qualified in aerospace medicine and in-flight operations. A flight medical specialty badge, the Aviation Psychologist Badge, is an additional decoration awarded by the U.S. Navy. Army psychologists who will serve with, or otherwise support, Army Aviation personnel may be selected to attend the AFSPC, however they may only be awarded the Basic Aircrew Badge upon completion of other requirements for that badge.

Its folk music consists of vocals (singing) accompanied by traditional drums, gong and other native percussion instruments. There is also a long history of flute-playing which is now defunct. The drums are made from a hollow tree trunk with membrane made from cow hide and the gongs, made of brass, are very similar to those found in Myanmar. History It is difficult to trace the origin, and to arrange the chronological sequences of the heritage of Mizo Music. However, some couplets were developed during the settlement of Thantlang in Burma, estimated between 1300-1400 AD. As recorded by B. Lalthangliana, the folk songs developed during this period were dar hla (songs on gong); Bawh hla (War chants), Hlado (Chants of hunting); Nauawih hla (Cradle songs) A greater development of songs can be seen from the settlement of Lentlang in Burma, estimated between late 15th to 17th Century AD.B. Thangliana, Mizo Literature, 1993, p.76 The Mizo occupied the present Mizoram from the late 17th century. The pre-colonial period, that is from the 18th to 19th century A.D. was another important era in the history of Mizo folk literature. Prior to the annexation by the British Government, the Mizo occupied the present Mizoram for two centuries. In comparison with the folk songs of Thantlang and Lentlang settlement, the songs of this period are more developed in its number, form and contents. The languages are more polished and the flows also better. Most of the songs of this period are named after the composers. In precolonial times, the Mizo's used the drum, gong and mouth organ made of gourd and mambo as musical instruments. With adoption of Christian identity, other musical instruments other than the drum lost their appeal. The first Musical instrument to enter Mizoram was the mouth organ brought in by Mrs Fraser in 1907. Mr Vankhama, a well known composer was influential in popularizing the guitar in Mizoram. Classification The Mizos have a traditional way of classification of their folk songs. A study of their folksongs on the basis of their own system of classification shows that the Mizos have about one hundred different types of folksongs.Lalruanga, A study on Mizo Folk Literature, impublished tunes. But it can broadly be classified into ten as follows: =Bawh Hla= This is the chant or cry raised by the warriors when returning from successful raid. The warriors chant Bawh Hla to show their superiority over the enemy, and in order to let his people know that a successful raid has taken place. No other members of the warriors except the killer of the enemy can chant Bawh Hla. =Hlado= This is the chant or cry raised by the hunters when a successful hunting has taken place. Chanting Hlado was done on the spot, or on the way home, or just before entering the village, or on the celebration. Anyone who witnessed his success could chant Hlado at any time and place. =Thiam hla and dawi hla (Invocation & incantation)= These two verse forms are chanted by the Priests and the witch while performing ceremonies. =Dar Hla= These are named after musical instruments. These songs are not sung by human voice, it is meant for musical instruments. Dar hla means ‚Äòsong for gong‚Äô. There are several songs named after the instruments; but Dar hla is the most popular and greatest in number. So it is commonly known as Dar hla. It has three musical notes.nome =Puipun Hla= These are songs named after merry and festive occasions. These songs are the most popular among the folksongs. People sung together with dancing at the time of merry and festive occasions. =Lengzem Zai= These are love songs. It has no distinctive form but it was named after the theme. This is presently (c. 1950-2012) the most popular type of folk music in Mizo community. =Songs named after tribes= Some verse forms are named after the particular tribe such as Sailo zai, saivate zai etc. =Songs named after villages= A few songs are named after the village such as Lumtui zai, Dar lung zai etc. =Songs named after modulation of the voice= A few song are named after modulation of the voice or sound such as Kawrnu zai, Zai nem, Vai zawi zai, Puma zai etc. For example, Kawrnu is a kind of Cicada whose voice is gentle and low. So the tune of new song resembling to the tune of Kawrnu is called Kawrnu zai. =Songs named after individuals= A great number of Mizo folksongs are named after individual. Most of them are named after the original composer of the music as well as the verse tunes. But some of the songs are named after a beautiful women or the hero of the tribe. The first six have their own common name while the last four have no such common name. Musical Instruments From time immemorial, the Mizo have been using different musical instruments. Even though we cannot date the origin, the \\"Mizo of Kabaw Valley during late 10th to 13th century AD had developed their music as nearly as they have done today\\".B.Lalthangliana, History of Mizo in Burma, p.71 The traditional Mizo musical instruments are very simple and crude in comparison to other Indian musical instruments and very out-dated to Modern Musical instruments. They can broadly be divided into three: Beating or Striking instruments; Wind instruments and String instruments. =Striking Instruments= Most of the Mizo musical instruments used at the time of festivals and dances are striking instruments such as different types of Khuang and Dar, Bengbung, Seki, Talhkhuang. Khuang Khuang (drum) is a Mizo indigenous instrument which occupies a very significant place in Mizo social and religious life. Khuang is a must on all occasions. It is made of hollow tree, wrapped on both sides with animal skin. The Mizo gives different names according to its size and length. The big sized one is call Khuangpui (Big drum), the middle one is called Khuanglai; and the small sized, Khuangte (little drum). If it is longish, they called it Kawlkhuang. As far as the history of Mizo is concerned it is commonly concluded that the Mizo ancestors started using drum as far back as when they sang and composed song. Lianhmingthanga believes that the Mizo had received drum from Chinese civilisation through cultural diffusion. The process of that cultural diffusion might have passed through the Burmese with whom the Mizo had a close cultural contact which took place from the middle of the 9th century AD until the end of Pagan period at the close of the 13th century AD.Lianhmingthanga, Material culture of the Mizo, 1998, p.30 Khuang is the only Mizo traditional musical instrument that is popularly used in the 20th and 21st century. In the olden days, Khuang has no role in the religious functions; but today the use of drum is a must in every church service. Dar (Gong) Another popular musical instruments are various sizes of brass-gongs viz-Darkhuang, Darbu and Darmang. Darkhuang Darkhuang is the biggest type. Darkhuang is very costly and is one of their most valuable possessions. In the olden times, it was sometimes used as a means of exchange; and sometimes the parent of a bride demanded Darkhuang for the price of their daughter. But this song (dor hla) is played with Darhu. Darkhuang is played on all occasions. Darkhuang is also used to announce demised of a person. Darbu Darbu is a set of three different sizes of brass-gongs, producing three musical notes. Darbu is usually played by three experts. Some experts played individually by tying the two gongs, one on each sides of his body with rope and hung one gong by his left hand, produce three distinct, rhythmic notes by simultaneous beating. Darbu is meaningfully used on certain occasions like Khuallam and other traditional group dances. Darmang Darmang is the smallest type of gong. It has no effect without other gongs or instruments, but it is used in the traditional dances to keep timing. All these gongs appear to be Burmese in origin, and therefore, it is tempting to conclude that Mizo got them from the Burmese while they were living in the Kabaw Valley during 9th to 13th century AD.B. Lalthangliana, History of Mizo in Burma, p.10 Bengbung Benghung is another Mizo indigenous instrument which has some similarity with xylophone. It is a musical instrument consisting of a series of flat wooden bars, producing three musical notes. Bengbung is usually played by girls in their leisure. Talhkhuang The process of making Talhkhuang is almost the same with that of Bengbung but Talhkhuang is much bigger than that of Bengbung. It is made of three wooden pieces which are curved out, the depth of the curves being made vary so that the sound produced when beaten are different in notes. It is played with a wooden hammer. The Mizo would never take Talhkhuang to their houses or anywhere wise except to Lungdawh, the great platform at the entrance of the village. It has played when a chief or the village erected memorial stones. Seki Seki is the domesticated mithun‚Äôs horn. The two hollow horns are beaten to lead or to keep timing for the other musical band like Darbu, etc. It was commonly used at the time of group dances are performed. =Wind Instruments= The Mizo have six varieties of wind instruments such as Rawchhem, Tumphit, Mautawtawrawl, Phenglawng, Buhchangkuang, Hnahtum.K. Zawla, Mizo Pipute leh an Thlahte Chanchin, p.82 Rawchhem It is a kind of Scottish \\"Bagpiper\\" or Chinese \\"Snag\\". Nine small Bamboo pipes or hollow reeds, Having different sizes and lengths are inserted to the dried gourd. One of the pipes serves as a mouth piece. Small portions of the pipes are struck out so that it can produce sound when the instrument is blown. The Musician blows into the mouth piece, and by controlling the holes with his fingers, he can produced various musical notes. Tumphit Tumphit is made of three small Bamboos having different sizes and length. The types are tied and plated in a row with caves or strings. The upper ends are cut open at different length so that each tube has different notes. The players put the open tube against his lower lip and then blows down. This musical instrument was used during ritual ceremonies and particularly on the occasion of a ceremony called Rallulam and chawng festival, the use of this music was a must. Tawtawrawt This is a Bamboo trumpet. Different sizes of bamboo tubes are cut off. The smaller tube is inserted to the bigger tube and so on. Many bamboo tubes are joined one after another till the last tube happens to be the size of a forefinger from where the trumpet is to be blown. A dry empty gourd, the bottom part is cut off and joined with bigger end of the bamboo tubes. The whole length can be more than five feet. Phenglawng It is the Mizo flute made of bamboo. Originally, Phenglawng had only three holes producing three different sounds. Flute is popular among the other Indians. Buhchangkuang This is another flute made of reed or a paddy stalk. This simple instrument was usually played by girls. Hnahtum The Mizo boys can skillfully turn leaves of many trees into simple but indigenous musical instruments. They can produce interesting sound by blowing deftly folded leaves. This is called Hnahtum. =Stringed Instruments= The Mizo have only three kinds of stringed instruments, namely ·π¨ing·π≠ang, Lemlawi and Tuiumdar: ·π¨ing·π≠ang This is Mizo guitar. Mizo ·π≠ing·π≠ang is a kind of fiddle or violin having only one string. A piece of bamboo shaft is fixed in the gourd to carry the string made of Thangtung, the fibre of the Malay Sago palm. The hollow gourd is cut open and covered with a dry bladder of animal. Lemlawi Lemlawi is the family of jaw harp but the shape and size are different. It is made of small pieces of bamboo. From the piece of bamboo, the craftsman took out a small portion with knife for its string. The sound it produces is controlled by the mouth. Tuium dar This simple musical instrument is also made of bamboo having three strings producing three different notes. From the outer covering of the bamboo, three pieces of cane like strings are curved out. The strings are then raised up by inserting two pieces of bamboo. It is played like a guitar. Artists The earliest popular Mizo artists include Lallianmawia Pachuau, CFL Hmingthanga, Lal·π≠anpuia Tochhawng, C. Lalrinmawia, K. Lalchamliana, H. Lal·π≠hakima, and Liandailova Chhangte. Popular female artists include Daduhi, Liandingpuii, Catherine Khiangte, Zoramchhani, Spi and Mami Varte in the current generation, and Vanhlupuii, Vanlalruati and C. Luri as more senior artists. Popular male artists include Vanlalsailova, Michael M Sailo, Joseph Zaihmingthanga, and F. Zothlamuana (Atea) Cellevain Mama Chawngthu. Kathryn McKenzie, Chhinlung Magazine, Vol. II, 1986, p.19.

The most remarkable period of historical writing was during the High Middle Ages in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, when English chronicles produced works with a variety of interest, wealth of information and amplitude of range. However one might choose to view the reliability or nature of particular works, it is from these that much of our knowledge of the Middle Ages originates. Early Middle Ages Prior to the boom in historical writing in the High Middle Ages, the number and quality of works from England's earlier period is often lacking, with some notable and bright exceptions. Later historians lamented the gaps in this period and usually explained it by way of Viking invasions; in the twelfth century William of Malmesbury said: \\"in many places in England that knowledge of the deeds of the saints has been wiped out, in my opinion by the violence of enemies\\".William of Malmesbury, Gesta pontificum Anglorum, ed. N.E.S.A. Hamilton (RS;1870) Listed chronologically, by author's death. Dates represent the historical period covered by the work(s). Works and authors listed are not exhaustive. Here are the major and most significant historians and chroniclers of the period:Antonia Gransden, Historical Writing in England: c. 500 to c. 1307 (1996) #Gildas, On the Ruin of Britain (De Excidio Britanniae) (died 570) #Bede, Ecclesiastical History of the English People (Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum) AD 1-731 #History of Britain (Historia Brittonum) 809 (attributed to Nennius, perhaps falsely) #Asser, Life of King Alfred 893 #Annales Cambriae, Annals of Wales 447-954 (c.970) #√Üthelweard, Chronicle (Chronicon √Üthelweardi) AD 1-975 High Middle Ages The High Middle Ages were a golden period for historical writing in England. The craft of history was not a professional subject taught in school, such as the scholastic subjects of logic, theology, law and natural science, but rather something practised by well-educated men of learning, not subjected to the process of systems and procedures of Academia. It was a realm for educated men in monasteries and the courts of kings, bishops and barons, who had the time and position and particular talents to pursue it. As a result, the quality and variety of the histories from this period are highly variable, with some entertaining and appealing examples. Numerous chroniclers prepared detailed accounts of recent history.Charles F. Briggs, \\"History, Story, and Community: Representing the Past,\\" in ed. Sarah Foot and Chase F. Robinson, eds., The Oxford History of Historical Writing: Volume 2: 400-1400 (2012) 2: 391. King Alfred the Great commissioned the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle in 893, and similar chronicles were prepared throughout the Middle Ages.Michael Swanton, The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (1998). The most famous production is by a transplanted Frenchman, Jean Froissart (1333-1410). His Froissart's Chronicles, written in French, remains an important source for the first half of the Hundred Years' War.John Jolliffe, Froissart's Chronicles (Faber & Faber, 2012 After the Norman Conquest of 1066 there was an explosion of interest in English history. It has been theorized this was due in part to the native English desire to reclaim their cultural identity from the debacle of 1066. As well the new Norman rulers were interested in discovering who it was they had reigned over, which fuelled demand for legends of England's early Kings, such as Geoffrey‚Äôs King Arthur. =Characteristics= The works of this period are often categorized by chronicles, and by literary histories. Chroniclers recorded events and dates of events with little prose or expansion. For example, the Winchcombe Annals, by a twelfth-century monk, wrote one paragraph for each year, no matter how much or little happened, with one sentence for each event in that year. In this way chronicles would often give as much, or more, attention to things of little importance as those things of greater importance. Unlike chronicles, the literary histories could be classified along with other forms of medieval literature. Indeed, entertainment was considered a legitimate function of historical writing. Historical accounts of battles often included long, and entirely invented, speeches from leaders. Histories were as much a part of medieval literature as other forms, such as the romance. Most of them endeavoured to be readable, arming themselves, as Roger of Wendover does, against both \\"the listless hearer and the fastidious reader\\" by \\"presenting something which each may relish\\", and so providing for the joint \\"profit and entertainment of all.\\"\\"Latin Chroniclers from the Eleventh to the Thirteenth Centuries: England and Normandy\\" from The Cambridge History of English and American Literature (1907‚Äì1921). Another characteristic of the histories of the period is that they borrowed heavily from other writers, often directly copying entire works as their own. For example, Henry of Huntingdon's History of the English is only one quarter original, relying in many places on Bede's Historia Ecclesiastica. This process would often be compounded as later writers would copy these works in full or part.Nancy Partner, \\"Henry of Huntingdon: Clerical Celibacy and the Writing of History.\\" Church History 42#04 (1973): 467-475. online Bede was highly regarded by historians of this period, and later historians lamented the fact that the 223-year period between Bede's death in 735 and Eadmers History of Recent Events (starting in 960) was sparsely represented. William of Malmesbury said of Bede \\"after him you will not easily find men who turned their minds to the composition of Latin histories of their own people\\".William of Malmesbury, Gesta regum, prologue. Henry of Huntingdon referred to Bede as \\"that holy and venerable man, a man of brilliant mind,\\".Henry of Huntingdon, Historia Anglorum, 4.11 For writing contemporary history, historians could draw on their own eye-witness accounts, reports from those they met and primary source documents such as letters. A good network of contacts was essential, and taking many journeys was common. Clerics assigned to the courts of Kings would often have the best access to information, such as Roger of Howden in Henry I's reign. Although some monks, such as William of Newburgh, never left their monastery, yet he was able to obtain considerable information through the network of story-telling and gossip which existed in the theoretical seclusion and silence of monastic life. =List of historians= Listed chronologically, by authors death.

On the other hand, his Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain) was considered almost entirely fiction and was not considered authentic history by some other contemporary historians. Kings of Britain covers the legend of King Arthur as well as other Welsh legends of the early period of England, and was presented, and often accepted, as actual English history. It was extremely popular, but other contemporary historians, interested in impartiality and truth, were highly critical of Geoffrey.

Plot summary The novel is the story of a gay English man, Edward Manners, who, disaffected with life, moves to a town in Flanders where he teaches two students English. One, Marcel, is plodding and plain while the other, Luc, is gifted and, to the protagonist, extremely beautiful. The novel also deals with Manners' emerging relationship with Marcel's father who curates a museum of symbolist paintings by Edgard Orst (modelled on Fernand Khnopff and James Ensor). Edward has an affair with a young foreigner named Cherif who falls deeply in love with him, but Edward, in love with Luc, can never really return his affection. We see the same pattern in the novel's recounting of Edward's youthful affair years earlier (when he was even younger than Luc) with Dawn, a handsome but not classically beautiful youth who later dies tragically. Edward soon became bored with him, and even now he can only gin up much feeling about Dawn by giving his past affair and the subsequent death of his old love a high literary treatment modeled after the tradition of the pastoral elegy. Like his forerunner von Aschenbach in Thomas Mann's Death in Venice (who obsesses over the beautiful Tadzio), and the artist Orst, Edward is a lover of beauty, not a lover of people, and people's beauty is fleeting. Thus the disappearance of Jane Byron, Orst's beautiful model, and later of Luc, Edward's version of Tadzio, represents how cruel life can be to those who worship at Beauty's altar. Many of the characters (Manners, Orst, Marcel's father, Luc) are marked by obsession with others. The past continually intrudes into the twilight world Hollinghurst evokes, dragging Manners back to England for a time. Two major characters, both objects of romantic obsession, mysteriously disappear. The long-lost Jane Byron, beloved model for Orst, had swum out to sea at Ostend, Belgium, decades ago and was never seen again, leaving the artist with a lifelong obsession for painting her image. The beautiful youth Luc, obsessive love interest of the protagonist Manners, also disappears. In the book's enigmatic conclusion, Luc is last seen looking out from one of many photographs of missing children on a salt-spattered bulletin board at the beach in Ostend. Thus, like Byron, he ultimately ends up existing only within a frame, and his disappearance is poetically linked to the \\"shiftless\\" North Sea waves at the famous beach. Reception The Folding Star won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction in 1994. It was also shortlisted for the Booker Prize. The New York Review of Books described it thus: \\"You could read this novel as a miniature Remembrance of Things Past. Or as an expanded Death in Venice... or as a homosexual Lolita.... It is an immense pleasure to read, [filled with] funniness and poetry, handled with amazing sensitivity and accuracy.\\"Quoted at Bloomsbury USA Peter Kemp, chief fiction reviewer of The Times Literary Supplement,Royal Society of Literature, Peter Kemp, 'Reviewing Literary Fiction', April 2013. said, \\"Even in its sexiest moments, it never loses its intellectual poise.

Plot introduction In 1983 London, Will, a privileged, gay, sexually irresistible 25-year-old, saves the life of an elderly aristocrat who has a heart-attack in a public lavatory. This chance meeting ultimately requires Will to re-evaluate his sense of the past and his family's history. =Explanation of the title= The title has at least three meanings. As recounted at the beginning of chapter 7, at Will's old prep school, prefects were known as 'librarians', the designation often taking a prefix to indicate the particular prefect's area of responsibility. Will, a keen swimmer at school as afterwards, became the 'Swimming-Pool Librarian'. His father, writing to offer congratulation, amusedly comments, 'you must tell me what kind of books they have in the Swimming-Pool Library.' For Will, the Swimming-Pool Library is slang for the changing-room to which he and his friends would slip in the middle of the night for illicit sexual activities. Also, at Charles Nantwich's home there is a room that has served as a library and was once a Roman bath. Finally, Will borrows trashy homoerotic novels from one of the lifeguards at the Corinthian club. The club, then, is a swimming pool library. Plot summary William Beckwith is a highly privileged, cultivated and promiscuous young gay man. He is the grandson and heir of Viscount Beckwith, an elder statesman and a recent peer. To avoid death duties, that grandfather has already settled most of his estate on Will, who therefore has substantial private means and no need of work. As the novel opens, Will is currently seeing a young, working-class, black man named Arthur. Will is deeply sexual and physically very attractive. His preoccupation with Arthur is almost entirely physical. Will is a member of the Corinthian Club (‚Äòthe Corry‚Äô) at which he swims, exercises and cruises men. The Corry is in no formal sense a gay club, indeed it is made clear that there are non-gay members, but there is a pervasive homoerotic atmosphere. Whilst cruising a young man in a London park, Will enters a public toilet to find a group of older men cottaging. One of them suddenly suffers what is perhaps a minor heart attack and collapses. Will applies artificial respiration and saves the man's life. He returns home to find Arthur bleeding and terrified. Arthur has accidentally killed a friend of his brother Harold's, after an argument about drugs. Will agrees to shelter Arthur. At the Corry, Will meets the old man again and learns that he is Lord (Charles) Nantwich. Charles invites Will to lunch at Wicks': his club. Wicks' is filled with men \\"of fantastic seniority\\". Will studied History at Oxford, getting a 2.1 rather than the first that he says had been expected of him. That he has studied history will in the course of the novel be revealed as an irony. Trapped in close confinement with Arthur, Will begins to resent him. Their boredom and tension occasionally erupts in bouts of vaguely abusive sex. Will goes to a cinema that shows gay pornography and has anonymous sex. On the train home, Will reads Valmouth, a novel by Ronald Firbank, given to him by his best friend, James. James is a hard-working doctor who is insecure and sexually frustrated as a gay man. The novel by Firbank echoes themes central to The Swimming-Pool Library; secrets and discretion; extreme old age, colonialism, race and camp; the sense of deeper truths residing behind a thin fa√ßade of artifice. Back at the flat, William finds his small nephew Rupert, an enchantingly self-possessed boy of six, who has run away from home. Rupert loves Will and is interested in homosexuality. Despite his youth, Rupert exhibits a strong gay sensibility. Will calls his sister Philippa and her husband Gavin comes to collect Rupert. While they're waiting, Will and Rupert look a photo album containing photos of a young Will and members of his family. Will goes to the Corry with James; on their return, Arthur has vanished. Will visits Charles at his home, where he lives with his servant Lewis. Lewis is curt, even slightly aggressive and seems jealously protective of Nantwich. Charles's house is filled with memorabilia and books; there are homoerotic paintings as well as a portrait of a beautiful African boy. In the cellar, they look at some Roman mosaics and Charles asks Will to write his biography for him. At the Corry, Will is attracted to Phil, a young bodybuilder. Despite his physique, Phil is shy and a sexual novice. Will suspects that Phil is the man with whom he had sex in the cinema. James believes that Will is wasting his intelligence and his literary skill and urges him to write Charles's biography. Will returns to Charles's house to find him locked in his bedroom by Lewis. Their master/servant relationship is complex and fraught. Will takes Charles‚Äô diaries and notes home. On the train, Will cruises a young man whom he takes home; they engage in sexual intercourse. He begins to read Charles's papers. Charles's early life vividly illustrates themes central to the experience of being homosexual, privileged and British. Will reads of his boyhood at public school, where he experienced sexuality by turns brutal and tender. He is cruelly raped by one boy but later taken under the protection of an older boy, Strong, who treats him gently. Strong became a soldier in the Great War, was badly injured and died insane. Charles becomes aware that he is strongly attracted to black men when he is openly propositioned by an American soldier. He experiences feelings of desperate arousal, fear and revulsion and flees. As a student, Charles goes on a spree with some friends in the country. They go to an abandoned hunting lodge and drink champagne. Charles has sex with one of them; a young man who feels insecure about his (comparatively) modest background and sexual inexperience. As a young man, Charles enters the Foreign Service and travels to Sudan to act as a regional administrator. He is enchanted by the land and powerfully drawn to African men but finds himself cut off by race, rank and position. Charles ruminates on the sense of devotion that homosexuality can foster between men and how that devotion aids duty and right action. Phil invites Will back to his lodgings in the Hotel where Phil works as a waiter. Phil wants sex but is too shy so Will seduces him. Will goes to the opera with James and his grandfather. The opera is Billy Budd. Will is struck almost to tears by the homoerotic and emotional power of the work. During the conversation afterwards, the subject of Benjamin Britten‚Äôs own homosexuality arises and they talk about his relationship with E. M. Forster, who co-wrote the libretto. The relationship between gay sexual expression and art is gently explored. Will continues reading Charles's diaries. On the way to a boxing club financially supported by Nantwich, Will has an unpleasant encounter with a working class boy, who offers him sex for money. Will refuses; there are undertones of fear and violence. At the match, Will meets Bill: a man he knows from the Corry. Bill is a weightlifter; a large muscular man who coaches teenage boxers. Trapped inside his body, Bill seems a fearful man. He is devoted to Nantwich, his patron, and to the boys he coaches. He is also carrying a torch for Phil. From the diaries, Will learns that Nantwich has been to Egypt and then returned to London, where he met with Ronald Firbank: an extraordinary portrait of effete decrepitude, camp and alcoholic. Will takes Phil to visit Staines, a successful studio photographer who echoes Cecil Beaton. Staines is a gossipy queen and socialite. His lover is a \\"school tart\\" grown old; a kept man drinking too much. Staines poses Phil bare-chested and oiled, as pornography. This episode overtly deals with gay artifice, staging and the image. Phil is idealised and objectified. Staines reveals that Charles's brother was homosexually insatiable, exploited his servants and was subsequently beaten to death and that Charles's uncle was likewise into rough trade. At Nantwich's house, Will and Charles talk about Ronald Firbank. Charles gives Will a beautiful edition of one of Firbank's novels as a gift. Afterwards, Will goes to Arthur's address in a working class area of London and calls but there is no answer. Returning, he encounters a group of skinheads who demand his watch, attack and queer-bash him, destroying the Firbank novel in the process. Will goes home, where James patches him up but beauty is temporarily ruined. He reads Charles's diary aloud to Phil: Charles describes a North African trying to covertly sell him gay pornography and is disturbed at being ‚Äòouted‚Äô in a foreign culture. Will returns to Staines's home with Nantwich. There are several other men there, including two youths and a black chef, Abdul, who works at Charles's club. Will is powerfully attracted to Abdul. It transpires that Staines and Nantwich are collaborating on the production of a pornographic film in which Abdul and the two youths are performing. The theme of voyeurism alienates Will, who finds it embarrassing and quietly leaves. Will takes Phil out clubbing at The Shaft. He has not been there for many months and there are vivid descriptions of a night on the gay ‚Äòscene‚Äô. Will and Phil drink, dance and meet several gay ‚Äòtypes‚Äô, including a Brazilian bodybuilder. He discovers Arthur, who has been working for his brother Harold, in the bathroom and attempts to have sex with him. Arthur is obviously quite upset, and they part ways. Will gets a telephone call from James; he has been arrested whilst seeking sex. This is ironic since James's sex-life is non-eventful compared to Will's. It appears to be a case of police-entrapment, with an undercover officer soliciting sex from homosexual men. Charles's diaries have entered the Second World War; he is entering middle-age and the tone is melancholy. He is passionately devoted to an African man; the beautiful boy whose portrait hangs in Charles's house. The boy is now grown and soon to marry. Will goes to an exhibition of photographs by Staines. The theme is soft-core homo-erotica. He is surprised to find Gavin there. Talking with Staines, he discovers that he and Charles have produced three pornographic films of the type that play in the cinema where Will first had sex with Phil. From the diaries, Will learns how Charles's life was ruined. The African man whom he loved gets married and Charles begins to visit anonymous sex clubs and cruisy bathrooms. One night he solicits a policeman, who arrests Charles for public indecency. Despite his rank, Charles is ruthlessly prosecuted by a conservative politician of the time, who wants to make an example of him. The politician is William's grandfather; now the Viscount Beckwith. Will's wealth, his rank and his leisured gay existence are all built on a foundation of homosexual persecution. He also learns that Charles and Bill met in prison, where Bill, then a young man, had been thrown for having a love-affair with a boy three years younger than himself. The theme of natural love and sexuality destroyed by elite oppression is very powerful. While Charles is in prison, he learns that Taha, the African man, has been beaten to death in an incident that is apparently racially motivated. After learning about his grandfather's past, Will decides that he cannot now write Charles's biography, nor was he intended to do so. Charles has been educating him on his own past. Will talks on the phone with Gavin, his brother in law. Gavin tells Will that he knew it was Will's grandfather who imprisoned Charles. A past perhaps so distant that the archaeologist knows it where the historian does not. Rupert has been told to watch out for Arthur; he reports that he has seen him with his brother Harold. Will goes to Phil's hotel. He encounters a rich Argentine who propositions him. Will accepts until he finds that the man is obsessed with gay pornographic conventions, costumes and sex toys. Will finds this all slightly ridiculous and is not aroused. He refuses to consent to sex and leaves. Upstairs, he discovers Phil having sex with Bill. Disoriented, he leaves and wanders to James's and then the Corry, where Charles Nantwich reveals his designs in giving Will the diaries. Will and James go to Staines's to see a film, not a piece of pornography but an archive recording of Ronald Firbank in old age. The novel closes.

It has a population of about 13,000. Geography The town is situated in the Elster Mountains, in the northwesternmost area of the historic Bohemia region close to the border with Germany. With the neighbouring municipalities Hranice, Kr√°sn√°, Podhrad√≠ and Hazlov in the south it forms A≈° Land ( or A≈°sko), a panhandle area surrounded by German territory in the east, north and west. This area, located north of the historic Egerland, is also referred to as Bohemian Vogtland. The A≈° municipal area comprises the localities of Doln√≠ Paseky, Doubrava, Horn√≠ Paseky, Kopaniny, Mok≈ôiny, Nebesa, Nov√Ω ≈Ωƒè√°r, and Vern√©≈ôov. Road border crossings lead to Bad Elster and Eichigt in Saxony in the east, as well as to Selb in Bavaria in the west. Pedestrians and bicyclists can directly reach Bad Brambach in the east and Rehau in the west. Border controls have been abolished since the Czech Republic implemented the Schengen Agreement in 2007. History Previously uninhabited hills and swamps, the town of Asch was founded in the early 11th century by German colonistsThe town of A≈° descending from the Bavarian march of the Nordgau in the course of the Ostsiedlung. So far, previous Slavic settlements in the area are not known.Fr√ºhgschichte Similar to the Egerland region, the dialect spoken in the town was that of the Upper Palatinate region in the south, also known as Northern Bavarian. In the adjacent Saxon Vogtlandkreis to the east, this dialect is only found in localities close to the Czech border, such as Adorf and Markneukirchen. The Upper Palatinate dialect has a stronger presence in the Bad Brambach area, where it is known as Southern Vogtlandic (S√ºdvogtl√§ndisch). The first recorded rulers were the Vogt ministeriales from Weida, Thuringia, who gave the entire Vogtland region its name. In 1281, they officially received the estates as an immediate fief at the hands of King Rudolph I of Germany. Emperor Louis the Bavarian elevated them to Princes of the Holy Roman Empire in 1329, nevertheless two years later, they sold A≈° Land to the Luxembourg king John of Bohemia, who since 1322 also held the adjacent Egerland in the south. Together with neighbouring Selb and Elster, A≈° was enfeoffed to the Freiherren of Neuberg (Podhrad√≠).R√ºdesheimer Erkl√§rung When in 1394 Konrad von Neuburg died without a male heir, by virtue of Hedwig von Neuburg's marriage to Konrad von Zedtwitz, Asch passed into the control of the noble House of Zedtwitz. Church attendance in Asch, 19th century In 1557, the A≈° region was finally incorporated into the Lands of the Bohemian Crown by the Habsburg king Ferdinand I. Like the neighbouring Egerland, it remained Protestant until the Thirty Years' War, as the Counter Reformation did not stretch to the West Bohemian borderlands. In the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, the Protestant confession of the citizens was confirmed. In 1774, Empress Maria Theresa officially mediatised A≈° as part of the Bohemian crown land within the Habsburg Monarchy, against the delaying resistance by the Zedtwitz noble family. Nevertheless, she granted its Protestant citizens freedom of religion, confirmed in the 1781 Patent of Toleration, issued by her son Emperor Joseph II. From 1806, Asch with Bohemia belonged to the Austrian Empire and Cisleithanian Austria after the Compromise of 1867. Until 1918, the town remained part of the Austria-Hungary, head of the Asch district, one of the 94 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in Bohemia.Die postalischen Abstempelungen auf den √∂sterreichischen Postwertzeichen-Ausgaben 1867, 1883 und 1890, Wilhelm KLEIN, 1967 In 1854 a county legal code was granted to the region, ending five centuries of legal control by the Zedtwitz family. Asch was linked to the Eger (Cheb)‚ÄìHof railway line in 1864, with a branch-off to Saxon Adorf opened in 1885. It obtained the status of a town in 1872, as the population grew due to a flourishing textile industry. By 1910 the population had risen to 21,880, from 9,405 in 1869. Upon the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy at the end of the World War I, a soldiers' council seized power and rejected the demands of separatists from Eger for annexation to the Bavarian lands of the German Weimar Republic, preferring to remain with the Republic of German- Austria, which was however soon denied by the 1919 Paris Peace Conference. During the negotiations of the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye the Americans, like Allen Welsh Dulles, had failed to persuade other powers to make at least the Bohemian peninsulas within Germany, like A≈° Land or Rumburk in the ≈†luknov Hook, legal parts of Weimar Germany. Thus the area became part of newly established state of Czechoslovakia, and received its current Czech nameCz. Republik On 18 November 1920, Czech militia toppled the monument of Emperor Joseph II against local protest, whereby three citizens were shot: 27yo Ferdinand K√ºnzel, 45yo baker Eduard Schindler, 22yo Robert K√§√ümannChronik A 1921 Czechoslovak census counted 183 ethnic Czechs, in a population of 40,000 in the district, a 1930 census 520 Czechs, in a population of 45,000 in the district. Wehrmacht soldiers parading in A≈°, 1938 In 1937, the Sudeten German Party took over in A≈°, led by Konrad Henlein, who for several years had worked in the town as a gym teacher. Henlein openly advocated the annexation of the Sudetenland territories to Nazi Germany, while Czech residents, mainly officials, were forced to leave the town. On 22 September 1938, a few days before the Munich Agreement, a Sudeten German Freikorps proclaimed a \\"Free State of Asch\\". Upon the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in October, according to the Agreement, Wehrmacht troops officially arrived, unopposed. By 1939 a German census counted a population of 23,130 in the town, almost 100% German Lutherans. From 1938 to 1945, Asch was one of the Municipalities in Sudetenland. At the end of World War II, the town was occupied by U.S. Army forces on 20 April 1945. Czech officials arrested 64 men on 7 June and took them to Bory Prison in Plze≈à, where half of them perishedDie Verfolgung Due to the Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia in 1946 by the Bene≈° decrees, the city's population was reduced, according to the official website, to \\"half of the pre-war number of inhabitants\\".\\"Because of the removal of German inhabitants in 1946 As had only a half of the pre-war number of inhabitants\\" https://web.archive.org/web/20060715090423/http://www.muas.cz/html/e_historie.htm A German expellee website states that 30,327 Germans have been expelled from March to November in 27 trains.Die Vertreibung In 1949, 3000 expellees met in far away R√ºdesheim am Rhein, to protest, stating that their area never was inhabited by Slavs other than as a tiny minority. The official website states that population shrank further in 1950 due to the establishment of the Iron Curtain and the Czechoslovak border fortifications during the Cold War by the ruling Communists, as the whole A≈° district was included into the border zone which made many people move out. Because of the lowering number of inhabitants some houses remained uninhabited. There was lack of money for their renovation and it was necessary to demolish them. The present-day population in the town is at approximately 12,000, roughly half of the pre-war population.

It is renowned for its rich cultural heritage. The State is inhabited by 16 major tribes along with other sub-tribes. Each tribe is distinct in character in terms of customs, language and dress.

One can listen to most of fine tuned songs and music organically produced in Nagaland on indihut, and HIYOMUSIC Mobile App; the only music streaming app found in the state.  Folk music  The oral tradition is kept alive from the media of folk tales and songs. Naga folk songs are both romantic and historical, with songs narrating entire stories of famous ancestors and incidents. There are also seasonal songs which describe various activities done in a particular agricultural season.Shikhu, Inato Yekheto. A Re-discovery and Re-building of Naga Cultural Values: An Analytical Approach with Special Reference to Maori as a Colonized and Minority Group of People in New Zealand (Daya Books, 2007) p 210 The themes of the folk music and songs are many; songs eulogizing ancestors, the brave deeds of warriors and traditional heroes; and poetic love songs immortalizing ancient tragic love stories.Nagaland music- Rattle and Hum Music Society The tribes living in the remote corners of Nagaland have their inherent tradition of music.

Some popular Zeliang folk songs are: HeliamleuHeliamleu , HereileuHereileu , NeuleuNeuleu and Hekialeu.Hekialeu  Indigenous instruments  There are several rhythmic instruments that aptly accompany the Nagaland music. The area's folk music is dominated by string instruments like the Tati (single string fiddle) and Theku among the Chakhesangs and Angami Nagas, Asem (drum with animal skin masked upon carved wood) and Jemji (Horn made using mithun horn). Indigenous musical instruments extensively used by the people are bamboo mouth organs, cup violins, bamboo flutes, trumpets, drums made of cattle skin, and log drums.Mongro, Kajen & Ao, A Lanunungsang. Naga cultural attires and musical instruments (Concept Publishing Company, 1999), Each tribe has unique traditional instruments influenced by their customs and materials available.  Dance  Music is also accompanied with the dance. Most of the dances are performed in groups. The most artistic dance of the state is the Zeliang dance. Strangely it is the monopoly of men, except in Zeliang tribe where women join with their men folk in dancing. Most of the dances are performed by clapping and chanting of some formulae. The beauty of the dances is raised by the colourful costumes. Dance is a very important part of life in rural Nagaland.Dance and Music nagalandonline.com Folk dances of Nagaland are performed mainly in a synchronized manner in groups by women as well as men, based on the kind of dance. Dances are generally performed in religious and festive occasions. Mainly the Naga men perform war dances. This dance is martial and athletic in style. All the folk dances of Nagaland are performed along with war cries and songs by the dancers. There are several folk dances in Nagaland which are generally performed at the time of harvest. The folk dances are filled with frolic and fun since these dances are performed when the people are enjoying a special event. Each Naga tribe has its own dance, but they have a common feature. All the folk dances of Nagaland require the using of legs while keeping the body in an upright position. War Dance is the most famous dance of the state. It involves a great deal of expertise as the performers go through dangerous war motions. Even a little bit of carelessness can prove highly dangerous.

However, the Zeliang tribe of Nagaland permits their women to take part in the folk dances with men. During a performance, the participants start entering slowly into the stage or arena with some distinctive movements and stand making a circle or other geometrical shape. After that, the dancers adjust the beats and then start dancing by stamping the foot on a continuous pace. The dances of this tribe are interspersed by chanting some set words in chorus and the clapping of hands. These shouting and chanting provides inspiration to every member of the group. After forming a circle, the dances make attack on the opposite party or an imaginary enemy with the spears which they hold in their hands. They swing these weapons as per the rhythm of dance, in order to create a beautiful musical background. The Nagas dress themselves in ceremonial war-type costume and brass and silver ornaments and other ornaments made of iron in order to beautify their look in the dance. As a result of the regional differences, some changes of very small quantity are observed in the pattern of dance. In general, this dance involves the upright body position at upper part, while the unbent or straight knees always keep equilibrium of movements. After attaining the climax, again the tempo is brought down and it is thus accompanied by a great increase in shouts, calls and cries.  Modern music  Two distinct genres of music exist in Nagaland: * the choral/church/Christian type commonly known as gospel music and * the rock/pop genre commonly known as secular music. Both types have their own distinct platforms, but their audience is by and large the same.

Exclusive gospel concerts are also initiated by local churches, theological institutions or concerned individuals. Naga Choirs travel not only to places outside the state but also to foreign countries in order to perform for various world audiences. Many Naga musicians adopt traditional and folk tunes to lend a distinctive individuality to their music.

These celebrations invariably coincide with agricultural lean periods such as after-harvest, and therefore the feeling of gaiety and generosity, even to a fault. In the old days the rich used to host several-day-long feasts in which the villagers reveled, and guests from other villages were feted. These were times when the youth were pitted against each other in friendly competitions in performing arts and traditional sports, while the old proudly looked on. Circumstances have changed; some have moved on while a few still embraces the old ways. Nevertheless, in either case the joie de vivre of the Nagas lives on.

Features unique to this model (apart from its storage medium) were smaller physical size and integrated FM tuner. *On October 11, 2005, it was revealed that, both Sirius and XM (with partner Samsung) will offer an MP3 satellite player that fall. Dell then announced that it would upgrade to a third- generation DJ and Pocket DJ with capability to play XM radio streams pre- recorded on an accompanying dock system. A color screen would replace the monochrome display. *On February 6, 2006, it was announced that Dell discontinued their hard drive based players, and will not release any future models at this time. *On August 18, 2006, Dell discontinued production of the Dell DJ Ditty. =Dell Pocket DJ= The Dell Pocket DJ is a pocket sized player released by Dell in 2004. It has 5 GB of memory, capable of holding 2,500 songs. It retailed for $199, which was the same price as the now discontinued 4 GB Apple iPod Mini. The Pocket DJ has a 10-hour battery life and charges through a USB plug either through the computer or electrical outlet. The Pocket DJ is compatible with many music stores and formats, such as WMA (Windows Media Audio), and MP3. It also sports a blue 160 by 104 pixel screen, although easy for most people to read in the daylight, it can be difficult to read at night, because the blue reduces the clarity of the screen. The buttons also light up on the front, providing easy navigation. The buttons include, Back, Home, Previous/Rewind, Play/Pause, and Next/FastForward. The interface looks similar to the Creative Zen Micro, except the Pocket DJ does not have voice recording or FM tuner. Similar to the iPod's click wheel, the Pocket DJ has a small scroll barrel that can be used to scroll through playlists, etc. When you scroll to a song, you push down on the barrel and a menu comes up asking you if you want to play the song, add it to a playlist, delete it, etc. You can bypass the pop-up menu by pushing the Play/Pause button. =Dell DJ 20 and Dell DJ 30= The Pocket DJ has three siblings: the DJ 20, which holds 20 GB of music; DJ 30, which holds 30 GB of music; and the DJ Ditty, a flash-based player which holds 512 MB of music. =Dell Ditty= The Dell Ditty was a small player that had 512 MB of flash memory and a built in FM tuner. It had a small screen showing the currently playing track. MP3 files could be dragged and dropped into the player through Windows Explorer. The player did not offer file choosing, just playback in order or random \\"shuffle\\" and repeat. Different color caps were available for purchase from Dell. The Ditty was discontinued in August 2006. Software =Dell software= Dell supplies two pieces of software with the purchase of a Digital Jukebox: The \\"basic\\" version of Musicmatch Jukebox and Dell DJ Explorer. The Musicmatch Jukebox software is used to copy, manage, and transfer music to the Dell DJ while the Dell DJ Explorer allows for the Dell DJ to be used as an external hard drive and provide more intuitive procedures to renaming, reordering, and simply putting songs on the music player by copying and pasting songs from the hard drive into the mp3 player. =Third- party software= Beside the Dell included DJ Explorer program that is used to transfer music and data, there are other transfer and track/file management programs *Free software: **Amarok is a music player for Linux **Creative Nomad Jukebox KIO::Slave is an integration driver for KDE which should also work with the Dell DJs. **Gnomad is a DJ Manager for Linux **Neutrino is another DJ Manager for Linux **Nomadsync is a DJ synchronization tool for Linux **XNJB is a DJ Manager for Mac OS X 10.3 and later *Proprietary software: **Deubox Explorer (formerly known as Dudebox Explorer) by Red Chair Software is a transfer program for Microsoft Windows.

The other stories in the collection are shorter, whereas at 15,952 words, \\"The Dead\\" is almost long enough to be described as a novella. The story deals with themes of love and loss as well as raising questions about the nature of the Irish identity. Characters * Gabriel Conroy ‚Äì the main character of the story. 15 Usher's Island, the house once partly rented by Joyce's great aunts which was the model for \\"the dark gaunt house on Usher's Island\\", the principal setting for the storyThe statue of William III of England on Dame Street, Dublin, appears in a story told by Gabriel about his grandfather Patrick Morkan. * Kate Morkan and Julia Morkan ‚Äì Gabriel and Mary Jane's aunts.

Gabriel Conroy, Gretta Conroy, Kate and Julia Morkan, and Bartell d'Arcy are all alluded to in James Joyce's later work, Ulysses, though no character from \\"The Dead\\" makes a direct appearance in the novel. Plot summary The story centres on Gabriel Conroy, a teacher and part-time book reviewer, and explores the relationships he has with his family and friends. Gabriel and his wife, Gretta, arrive late to an annual Christmas party hosted by his aunts, Kate and Julia Morkan, who eagerly receive him. After a somewhat awkward encounter with Lily, the caretaker's daughter, Gabriel goes upstairs and joins the rest of the party attendees. Gabriel worries about the speech he has to give, especially because it contains academic references that he fears his audience will not understand. When Freddy Malins arrives drunk, as the hosts of the party had feared, Aunt Kate asks Gabriel to make sure he is all right. As the party moves on, Gabriel is confronted by Miss Ivors, an Irish nationalist, about his publishing a weekly literary column in the Unionist newspaper The Daily Express. She teases him as a \\"West Briton,\\" that is, a supporter of English political control of Ireland. Gabriel recalls that he gets 15 shillings a week and \\"the books he received for review were almost more welcome than the paltry cheque\\". He thinks this charge is highly unfair, but fails to offer a satisfactory rejoinder. The encounter ends awkwardly, which bothers Gabriel the rest of the night. He becomes more disaffected when he tells his wife of the encounter and she expresses an interest in returning to visit her childhood home of Galway. The music and party continues, but Gabriel retreats into himself, thinking of the snow outside and his impending speech. Dinner begins, with Gabriel seated at the head of the table. The guests discuss music and the practices of certain monks. Once the dining has died down, Gabriel thinks once more about the snow and begins his speech, praising traditional Irish hospitality, observing that \\"we are living in a sceptical...thought- tormented age,\\" and referring to Aunt Kate, Aunt Julia and Mary Jane as the Three Graces. The speech ends with a toast, and the guests sing \\"For they are jolly gay fellows.\\" The party was winding down, and as the guests filter out and Gabriel prepares to leave, he finds his wife standing, apparently lost in thought, at the top of the stairs. From another room, Bartell D'Arcy singing \\"The Lass of Aughrim\\" can be heard. The Conroys left and Gabriel is excited, for it has been a long time since he and Gretta have had a night in a hotel to themselves. When they arrived at the hotel, Gabriel's aspirations of passionate lovemaking are conclusively dashed by Gretta's lack of interest. He presses her about what is bothering her, and she admits that she is \\"thinking about that song, The Lass of Aughrim.\\" She admits that it reminds her of someone, a young man named Michael Furey, who had courted her in her youth in Galway. He used to sing The Lass of Aughrim for her. Furey died at seventeen, early in their relationship, and she had been very much in love with him. She believes that it was his insistence on coming to meet her in the winter and the rain, while already sick, that killed him. After telling these things to Gabriel, Gretta falls asleep. At first, Gabriel is shocked and dismayed that there was something of such significance in his wife's life that he never knew about. He ponders the role of the countless dead in living people's lives, and observes that everyone he knows, himself included, will one day only be a memory. He finds in this fact a profound affirmation of life. Gabriel stands at the window, watching the snow fall, and the narrative expands past him, edging into the surreal and encompassing the entirety of Ireland. As the story ends, we are told that \\"His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead.\\" Reception Dan Barry of The New York Times called \\"The Dead\\" \\"just about the finest short story in the English language\\" on the centennial of Dubliners. T. S. Eliot called it one of the greatest short stories ever written. Joyce biographer and critic Richard Ellmann wrote, \\"In its lyrical, melancholy acceptance of all that life and death offer, 'The Dead' is a linchpin in Joyce's work.\\" Cornell University Joyce scholar Daniel R. Schwarz described it as \\"that magnificent short novel of tenderness and passion but also of disappointed love and frustrated personal and career expectations.\\" Adaptations \\"The Dead\\" was adapted as a one-act play of the same name by Hugh Leonard in 1967.Irish Playography entry for Hugh Leonard retrieved 7 July 2013 In 1987 it was adapted into the film The Dead directed by John Huston, starring Anjelica Huston as Gretta Conroy and Donal McCann as Gabriel Conroy.Film review of The Dead, from RogerEbert.com It is referenced in the Father Ted episode \\"Grant Unto Him Eternal Rest\\", when Ted quotes from the end of the story on the night before Father Jack's funeral, as it begins to snow. In 1999 it was adapted into a Broadway musical by Richard Nelson and Shaun Davey, which won a Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical.Tony Award history, from TonyAwards.com The original production starred Christopher Walken as Gabriel Conroy.

The Watchdogs have also been adapted into other media, having appeared in the TV series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the video game Marvel's Avengers.  Publication history  The Watchdogs first appeared in Captain America #335 (Nov 1987) and were created by writer Mark Gruenwald and artist Tom Morgan. Most of the villains Mark Gruenwald introduced in Captain America were created to symbolize aspects of contemporary American culture and the world political situation. In the case of the Watchdogs, Gruenwald created them to symbolize censorship and repression.  Philosophy, goals, and activities  The Watchdogs are dedicated to restoring and preserving traditional American culture and values, and fighting against indecency, immorality, and sexual perversion. The Watchdogs seek to impose their conservative moral views on the general public; they believe in strict enforcement of family values, and are violently opposed to pornography, obscenity, sex education, abortion, homosexuality, and the teaching of evolutionary theory. Their terrorist activities, which include vandalism, arson, intimidation, assault, kidnapping, brainwashing, and murder, are targeted primarily at people who produce material which the Watchdogs consider pornographic, including nude art and sexually explicit music. The Watchdogs are active in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, West Virginia, Missouri, plus Washington, D.C. and New York City. The Watchdogs imprison their kidnapping victims at a large compound in Vermont, where they force them to wear \\"dog collars\\" which the Watchdogs use to administer a painful electric shock as punishment for undesirable behavior. The prisoners are forced to participate in group activities such as sing-alongs, and exposed to constant televised Americana imagery such as baseball games, American flags, fields of flowers, and happy children.  Organization  The Watchdogs are headed by a leader referred to as Watchdog Prime (real name unknown), also called Watchdog One or Top Dog. Each state (\\"realm\\") is governed by a Head Dog. Each realm has one or more operating units (\\"packs\\"). Individual cells of Watchdogs, called \\"dogpounds,\\" are organized by city and led by \\"pack leaders.\\" Members call one another Dog- Brothers. Unbeknownst to nearly all of its membership, the Watchdogs were partially funded by the Red Skull through his dummy corporation, the Freedom Foundations; the Watchdogs receive the rest of their funding through public contributors and other undisclosed financiers. Watchdog Prime held the position of one of the Red Skull's \\"division chiefs,\\" and the Red Skull saw in them an opportunity to harm America by creating chaos. Whether Watchdog Prime was deceived by the Skull or was secretly working against that which he claimed to uphold is unknown. The Watchdogs use conventional technology, with all weapons and paraphernalia purchased from legitimate retailers; members use their own ground vehicles, usually pick up trucks, vans, motorcycles, and recreational vehicles. The Watchdogs wear identical costumes of synthetic stretch fabric resembling riot gear, consisting of tight-fighting purple shirts and pants with gold-colored gloves, leather boots and accessories, armored kevlar vests, and hard plastic helmets with built-in visors. They are trained in the use of firearms, and usually arm themselves with conventional American-manufactured handguns, shotguns, and rifles, and Army surplus explosives. Watchdogs also carry Army surplus walkie-talkies, and short-wave radios. The Red Skull denies Watchdog Prime's request for funding to purchase exotic weaponry, because use of such weapons would undermine the group's image as a grassroots organization. A Watchdog member must be an adult male over 21 with a valid gun permit willing to sign an affidavit in blood that he is not a homosexual, believes in the Bible and the United States Constitution, disavows all immoral acts, and is willing to use violence to oppose all activities, materials, institutions, and individuals which are deemed by the organization to undermine the morality and decency of the United States.  Fictional team biography  The Watchdogs were introduced as the first group fought by John Walker and Lemar Hoskins after officially becoming the new Captain America and Bucky, respectively. A major Watchdog pack torches an adult bookstore and women's health clinic, and attempts to lynch an alleged pornographer. This pack is busted by John Walker, as the interim Captain America, who was initially conflicted in his opposition to the Watchdogs because he shared their political views.Captain America #335 The Watchdogs later hold Walker's parents captive in an effort to get revenge upon him; during the ensuing melee, the Watchdogs murdered his parents, and Walker became a bitter enemy of the organization.Captain America #345. Marvel Comics. The Red Skull was seen to have employed a single Watchdog in his elite cadre of bodyguards.Captain America #350. Marvel Comics. At the public ceremony where Walker relinquished his title of Captain America to Rogers, a lone Watchdog shot and apparently killed Walker. In the same issue, an unnamed member of the Watchdogs was killed by Scourge of the Underworld disguised as a government agent.Captain America #351. Marvel Comics. The \\"Watchdog\\" was actually a government agent who staged the ruse on John Walker's behalf so that he can re-emerge as the U.S. Agent.Captain America #354. Marvel Comics. As Captain America, Rogers continued to oppose the Watchdogs, especially once they kidnapped his then- girlfriend Bernie Rosenthal.Captain America #385. Marvel Comics. Although he and U.S. Agent arrested all the Watchdogs at the Vermont compound,Captain America #386 the organization was apparently still active by Captain America #394, when Watchdog Prime joined his fellow division chiefs in a meeting with the Red Skull. At the time, they were expanding their operations and membership westward across the United States.Captain America #394. Marvel Comics.  Other versions  In the Ultimate Marvel universe, the Watchdogs are a terrorist hate group that were killed by Scourge.All-New Ultimates #9. Marvel Comics.  In other media  = Television = * The Watchdogs appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. This version is a radical Inhuman-hunting group, led by wheelchair-bound ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Felix Blake and secretly supported by Hydra. Introduced in their self-titled third season episode, they attack an Advanced Threat Containment Unit (ATCU) facility with Nitramine explosives. They mistook S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Mack for an Inhuman and attacked him and his brother, but were either killed or wounded, with the latter being taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. In the episode \\"Emancipation\\", Inhumans Hive and Hellfire kidnap a group of Watchdogs and subject them to Holden Radcliffe's experiments to turn them into Inhuman Primitives to bolster Hive's forces. In the fourth season episode \\"Uprising\\", the Watchdogs, now backed by anti-Inhuman senator Ellen Nadeer, use an EMP device to shut down power in various cities holding Inhumans to halt Inhuman registration, but their plans are foiled by Mack, Phil Coulson, Elena \\"Yo-Yo\\" Rodriguez, and Leo Fitz. In the episode \\"Let Me Stand Next to Your Fire\\", Hellfire helps the Watchdogs kill his fellow Inhumans in exchange for them killing him last, but they are defeated by Daisy Johnson and Ghost Rider. In the episode \\"Broken Promises\\", Nadeer orders a group of Watchdogs to guard her while she attends to her Inhuman brother, Vijay. However, Daisy, Jeffrey Mace, and Jemma Simmons confront Nadeer and defeat the Watchdogs, though the senator escapes and kills Vijay before meeting with the Watchdog Superior, Anton Ivanov. In the episode \\"BOOM\\", Watchdog Tucker Shockley is exposed to Terrigen gas and turns into an explosive Inhuman, killing Nadeer. In response to this, Ivanov arranges for S.H.I.E.L.D. to capture him while he and the Watchdogs capture Mace. In the episode, \\"The Man Behind the Shield\\", Ivanov confronts Coulson and Daisy, only to be buried alive by the latter. In the episode \\"Self-Control\\", the android AIDA converts Ivanov into an LMD and places his head in a jar to coerce him into helping her steal the Darkhold and protect her Framework. In the episode \\"The Return\\", Ivanov receives multiple robotic copies of himself which he can control mentally. In the episode \\"World¬¥s End\\", Ivanov plans to take the Darkhold to a meeting with S.H.I.E.L.D. in an effort to use the book against the Inhumans and secretly sent an LMD Daisy to attack Glenn Talbot. Ghost Rider and Daisy defeat the LMD Daisy and Ivanov while Coulson and Melinda May recover the Darkhold, but Ivanov succeeds in turning the world against S.H.I.E.L.D. In the season five episode \\"The Devil Complex\\", Hydra agent General Hale locates Ivanov's head and coerces him into working for her so they can save Earth from Thanos. In the episode \\"The Honeymoon\\", Ivanov attempts to defend a Hydra facility from Yo-Yo, only to killed by her while his robotic soldiers are deactivated upon his death. The Watchdogs also make minor appearances in the episodes \\"Lockup\\", in which they recruited new members from prisons, and \\"Hot Potato Soup\\", in which they attempted to obtain the Darkhold. ** The Watchdogs appear in the web series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot. In the episode \\"Deal Breaker\\", former National Police of Colombia member turned arms dealer Victor Ramon escapes from prison and joins forces with the Watchdogs to help them eliminate Inhumans and capture Yo-Yo. In the episode \\"Justicia\\" however, the Watchdogs' Alpha Dog accidentally kill Ramon while the rest are defeated by S.H.I.E.L.D. = Video games = * The Watchdogs appear in the 2020 Avengers video game.

It means that which causes offence, annoyance, trouble or injury. A nuisance can be either public (also \\"common\\") or private. A public nuisance was defined by English scholar Sir J. F. Stephen as, > \\"an act not warranted by law, or an omission to discharge a legal duty, > which act or omission obstructs or causes inconvenience or damage to the > public in the exercise of rights common to all Her Majesty's subjects\\".Sir > J. F. Stephen, Digest of the Criminal Law, p.120 Private nuisance is the interference with the right of specific people. Nuisance is one of the oldest causes of action known to the common law, with cases framed in nuisance going back almost to the beginning of recorded case law. Nuisance signifies that the \\"right of quiet enjoyment\\" is being disrupted to such a degree that a tort is being committed. Definition Under the common law, persons in possession of real property (land owners, lease holders etc.) are entitled to the quiet enjoyment of their lands. However this doesn't include visitors or those who aren't considered to have an interest in the land. If a neighbour interferes with that quiet enjoyment, either by creating smells, sounds, pollution or any other hazard that extends past the boundaries of the property, the affected party may make a claim in nuisance. Legally, the term nuisance is traditionally used in three ways: # to describe an activity or condition that is harmful or annoying to others (e.g., indecent conduct, a rubbish heap or a smoking chimney) # to describe the harm caused by the before-mentioned activity or condition (e.g., loud noises or objectionable odors) # to describe a legal liability that arises from the combination of the two.Restatement (Second) of Torts ¬ß 821A cmt. b (1979). Originally developed as a private tort tied to the land, a nuisance action was generally brought when a person interfered with another's \\"use or enjoyment of land.\\" However, the \\"interference\\" was not the result of a neighbor stealing land or trespassing on the land. Instead, it arose from activities taking place on another person's land that affected the enjoyment of that land.\\"William L. Prosser, Private Action for Public Nuisance, 52 Va. L. Rev. 997, 997 (1966)\\". The law of nuisance was created to stop such bothersome activities or conduct when they unreasonably interfered either with the rights of other private landowners (i.e., private nuisance) or with the rights of the general public (i.e., public nuisance) A public nuisance is an unreasonable interference with the public's right to property. It includes conduct that interferes with public health, safety, peace or convenience. The unreasonableness may be evidenced by statute, or by the nature of the act, including how long, and how bad, the effects of the activity may be.Restatement (Second) of Torts ¬ß 821B Private nuisance arose out of the action on the case and protects a person‚Äôs right to the use and enjoyment of their land.Sappideen, C (Carolyn), Torts: Commentary and Materials (Thomson Reuters (Professional) Australia Limited, 12 ed, 2016) 771. It doesn't include trespass.Restatement (Second) of Torts ¬ß 821D To be a nuisance, the level of interference must rise above the merely aesthetic. For example: if your neighbour paints their house purple, it may offend you; however, it doesn't rise to the level of nuisance. In most cases, normal uses of a property that can constitute quiet enjoyment cannot be restrained in nuisance either. For example, the sound of a crying baby may be annoying, but it is an expected part of quiet enjoyment of property and does not constitute a nuisance.Nuisance distinguishes between cases where the conduct alleged to be a nuisance has caused material injury to property and the cases where it has caused ‚Äúsensible personal discomfort‚Äù.. Any affected property owner has standing to sue for a private nuisance. If a nuisance is widespread enough, but yet has a public purpose, it is often treated at law as a public nuisance. Owners of interests in real property (whether owners, lessors, or holders of an easement or other interest) have standing only to bring private nuisance suits. According to Oldham v Lawson. (where held that the husband has a mere licence and had no title to sue whereas his wife as owner did have title to sue) and some later cases, exclusive possession is necessary to establish a private nuisance case. However, one situation related to transform a private nuisance against land to one against person, this case is no longer considered to be authoritative., was overruled by the House of Lords in . History and legal development In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the law of nuisance became difficult to administer, as competing property uses often posed a nuisance to each other, and the cost of litigation to settle the issue grew prohibitive. As such, most jurisdictions now have a system of land use planning (e.g. zoning) that describes what activities are acceptable in a given location. Zoning generally overrules nuisance. For example: if a factory is operating in an industrial zone, neighbours in the neighbouring residential zone can't make a claim in nuisance. Jurisdictions without zoning laws essentially leave land use to be determined by the laws concerning nuisance. Similarly, modern environmental laws are an adaptation of the doctrine of nuisance to modern complex societies, in that a person's use of his property may harmfully affect another's property, or person, far from the nuisance activity, and from causes not easily integrated into historic understandings of nuisance law. Remedies Under the common law, the only remedy for a nuisance was the payment of damages. However, with the development of the courts of equity, the remedy of an injunction became available to prevent a defendant from repeating the activity that caused the nuisance, and specifying punishment for contempt if the defendant is in breach of such an injunction. The law and economics movement has been involved in analyzing the most efficient choice of remedies given the circumstances of the nuisance. In Boomer v. Atlantic Cement Co. a cement plant interfered with a number of neighbors, yet the cost of complying with a full injunction would have been far more than a fair value of the cost to the plaintiffs of continuation. The New York court allowed the cement plant owner to 'purchase' the injunction for a specified amount‚Äîthe permanent damages. In theory, the permanent damage amount should be the net present value of all future damages suffered by the plaintiff. =Inspector of Nuisances= An Inspector of Nuisances was the title of an office in several English-speaking jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions this term is now archaic, the position and/or term having been replaced by others. In medieval England it was an office of the Courts Leet and later it was also a parochial office concerned with local action against a wide range of 'nuisances' under the common law: obstructions of the highway, polluted wells, adulterated food, smoke, noise, smelly accumulations, eavesdropping, peeping toms, lewd behaviour, and many others. In the United Kingdom from the mid- 19th century this office became associated with solving public health and sanitation problems, with other types of nuisances being dealt with by the local constables. The first Inspector of Nuisances appointed by a UK local authority Health Committee was Thomas Fresh in Liverpool in 1844. Liverpool later promoted a private Act, the Liverpool Sanatory (sic) Act 1846, that created a statutory post of Inspector of Nuisances. This became the precedent for later local and national legislation. In local authorities that had established a Board of Health under the Public Health Act 1848, or under local Acts implementing the Towns Improvement Clauses Act of 1847, the title was 'Inspector of Nuisances'. The Nuisances Removal and Diseases Prevention Act 1855 and the Metropolis Management Act 1855 (via section 134) mandated such an office but with the title of 'Sanitary Inspector'. So in some places the title was 'Sanitary Inspector' and in others 'Inspector of Nuisances'. Eventually the title was standardized across all UK local authorities as 'Sanitary Inspector'. An Act of Parliament in 1956 changed the title to 'Public Health Inspector'. Similar offices were established across the British Commonwealth and Empire. The nearest modern equivalent of this position in the UK is the Environmental Health Officer. This title being adopted by local authorities on the recommendation of Central Government after the Local Government Act 1972. Today, Registered UK Environmental Health Officers working in non-enforcement roles (e.g. in the private sector) may prefer to use the generic term 'Environmental Health Practitioner'. In New South Wales the NSW Public Health Act 1896 gave the NSW Board of Health power to establish 'standards of strength and purity for articles of general consumption', to appoint analysts, and 'to cause to be made such enquiries as it thinks fit in relation to any matters concerning the public health'. Inspectors under the new Act were known as Inspectors of Nuisances, but were later renamed 'sanitary inspectors'. In the United States, a modern example of an officer with the title 'Inspector of Nuisances' but not the public health role is found in Section 3767[7] of the Ohio Revised Code which defines such a position to investigate nuisances, where this term broadly covers establishments in which lewdness and alcohol are found. Whereas in the United States the environmental health officer role is undertaken by local authority officers with the titles 'Registered Environmental Health Specialist' or 'Registered Sanitarian' depending on the jurisdiction. Law related to nuisance, by country =England= The boundaries of the tort are potentially unclear, due to the public/private nuisance divide, and existence of the rule in Rylands v Fletcher. Writers such as John Murphy at Lancaster University have popularised the idea that Rylands forms a separate, though related, tort. This is still an issue for debate, and is rejected by others (the primary distinction in Rylands concerns 'escapes onto land', and so it may be argued that the only difference is the nature of the nuisance, not the nature of the civil wrong.) Under English law, unlike US law, it is no defence that the claimant \\"came to the nuisance\\": the 1879 case of Sturges v Bridgman is still good law, and a new owner can bring a claim in nuisance for the existing activities of a neighbour. In February 2014 the UK Supreme Court ruling in the case of Coventry v Lawrence. prompted the launch of a campaignhttp://www.steamin.in/RDC/Petition.htm to have the \\"coming to a nuisance\\" law overturned. Campaigners hold that established lawful activity continuing with planning permission and local residents' support should be accepted as part of the character of the area by any new residents coming to the locality. =United States= Many states have limited instances where a claim of nuisance may be brought. Such limitation often became necessary as the sensibilities of urban dwellers were offended by smells of agricultural waste when they moved to rural locations. For example: many states and provinces have \\"right to farm\\" provisions, which allow any agricultural use of land zoned or historically used for agriculture. There are two classes of nuisance under the American law: a nuisance in fact, or \\"nuisance per accidens\\", and a nuisance per se. The classification determines whether the claim goes to the jury, or gets decided by the judge. An alleged nuisance in fact is an issue of fact to be determined by the jury, who will decide whether the thing (or act) in question created a nuisance, by examining its location and surroundings, the manner of its conduct, and other circumstances.City of Sunland Park v. Harris News, Inc., 2005-NMCA-128, 45, 124 P.3d 566, 138 N.M. 58 (citing 58 AM.JUR.2D Nuisances ¬ß 21) A determination that something is a nuisance in fact also requires proof of the act and its consequences. By contrast, a nuisance per se is \\"an activity, or an act, structure, instrument, or occupation which is a nuisance at all times and under any circumstances, regardless of location or surroundings.\\"Id. 40 (citing State ex rel. Village of Los Ranchos v. City of Albuquerque, 119 N.M. 150, 164, 889 P.2d 185, 199 (1994)) Liability for a nuisance per se is absolute, and injury to the public is presumed; if its existence is alleged and established by proof, it is also established as a matter of law.See 58 AM.JUR.2D Nuisances ¬ß 21 Therefore, a judge would decide a nuisance per se, while a jury would decide a nuisance in fact. Most nuisance claims allege a nuisance in fact, for the simple reason that not many actions or structures have been deemed to be nuisances per se. In general, if an act, or use of property, is lawful, or authorized by competent authority, it cannot be a nuisance per se.See 58 AM.JUR.2D Nuisances ¬ß 20 Rather, the act in question must either be declared by public statute, or by case law, to be a nuisance per se.State v. Davis, 65 N.M. 128, 132, 333 P.2d 613, 616 (1958); See also Sunland Park, 2005-NMCA-128, 47 There are few state or federal statutes or case law declaring actions or structures to be a nuisance in and of themselves. Few activities or structures, in and of themselves and under any and all circumstances, are a nuisance; which is how courts determine whether or not an action or structure is a nuisance per se.Koeber, 72 N.M. at 5, 380 P.2d at 16. Over the last 1000 years, public nuisance has been used by governmental authorities to stop conduct that was considered quasi-criminal because, although not strictly illegal, it was deemed unreasonable in view of its likelihood to injure someone in the general public. Donald Gifford\\"Donald G. Gifford\\", Research Professor of Law at the University of Maryland School of Law argues that civil liability has always been an \\"incidental aspect of public nuisance\\".Donald G. Gifford, Public Nuisance as a Mass Products Liability Tort, 71 U. Cin. L. Rev. 741, 781 (2003) Traditionally, actionable conduct involved the blocking of a public roadway, the dumping of sewage into a public river or the blasting of a stereo in a public park.Restatement (Second) of Torts ¬ß 821A cmt. b (1979) To stop this type of conduct, governments sought injunctions either enjoining the activity that caused the nuisance or requiring the responsible party to abate the nuisance. In recent decades, however, governments blurred the lines between public and private nuisance causes of action. William Prosser noted this in 1966 and warned courts and scholars against confusing and merging the substantive laws of the two torts. In some states, his warning went unheeded and some courts and legislatures have created vague and ill-defined definitions to describe what constitutes a public nuisance. For example, Florida's Supreme Court has held that a public nuisance is any thing that causes \\"annoyance to the community or harm to public health.\\"John Gray, \\"Public Nuisance Law: An Historical Perspective\\" A contemporary example of a nuisance law in the United States is the Article 40 Bylaw of Amherst, Massachusetts known as the Nuisance House Bylaw. The law is voted on by members of the town at town meetings. The stated purpose of such a law is \\"In accordance with the Town of Amherst‚Äôs Home Rule Authority, and to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the inhabitants of the Town, this bylaw shall permit the Town to impose liability on owners and other responsible persons for the nuisances and harm caused by loud and unruly gatherings on private property and shall discourage the consumption of alcoholic beverages by underage persons at such gatherings.\\" In practice, the law works so that if one member of the neighborhood feels that there is a neighbor's noise level is annoying or excessively loud, that neighbor is instructed to inform the town police so that they can respond to the location of the noise. \\"The responding officer has some discretion in how to deal with the noise complaint.... When determining the appropriate response, the officer may take many factors into consideration, such as the severity of the noise, the time of day, whether the residents have been warned before, the cooperation of the residents to address the problem.\\"http://www.amherstma.gov/DocumentView.aspx?DID=66 The term is also used less formally in the United States to describe the non-meritorious nature of frivolous litigation. A lawsuit may be described as a \\"nuisance suit\\", and a settlement a \\"nuisance settlement\\", if the defendant pays money to the plaintiff to drop the case primarily to spare the cost of litigation, rather than because the suit would have a significant likelihood of winning. Environmental nuisance In the field of environmental science, there are a number of phenomena which are considered nuisances under the law, including most notably noise, water and light pollution. Moreover there are some issues that are not necessarily legal matters that are termed environmental nuisance; for example, an excess population of insects or other vectors may be termed a \\"nuisance population\\" in an ecological sense.C. Michael Hogan, ed. 2010. American Kestrel. Encyclopedia of Earth, U.S. National Council for Science and the Environment, Ed-in-chief C. Cleveland In terms of environmental nuisance litigations, it is hard for someone to be successful in this area due to the standing requirements of private and public nuisance. It is the Court's opinion that legislation should regulate this area.Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Collieries Plc [1994] 1 All ER 53, 57 Particularly, in Australia, all the jurisdictions have such kind of legislation... From Britannica 1911 A common nuisance is punishable as a misdemeanour at common law, where no special provision is made by statute. In modern times, many of the old common law nuisances have been the subject of legislation. It's no defence for a master or employer that a nuisance is caused by the acts of his servants, if such acts are within the scope of their employment, even though such acts are done without his knowledge, and contrary to his orders. Nor is it a defence that the nuisance has been in existence for a great length of time, for no lapse of time will legitimate a public nuisance. A private nuisance is an act, or omission, which causes inconvenience or damage to a private person, and is left to be redressed by action. There must be some sensible diminution of these rights affecting the value or convenience of the property. \\"The real question in all the cases is the question of fact, whether the annoyance is such as materially to interfere with the ordinary comfort of human existence\\" (Lord Romilly in Crump v. Lambert (1867) L.R. 3 Eq. 409). A private nuisance, differing in this respect from a public nuisance, may be legalized by uninterrupted use for twenty years. It used to be thought that, if a man knew there was a nuisance and went and lived near it, he couldn't recover, because, it was said, it is he that goes to the nuisance, and not the nuisance to him. But this has long ceased to be law, as regards both the remedy by damages, and the remedy by injunction. The remedy for a public nuisance is by information, indictment, summary procedure or abatement. An information lies in cases of great public importance, such as the obstruction of a navigable river by piers. In some matters, the law allows the party to take the remedy into his own hands, and to \\"abate\\" the nuisance. Thus; if a gate be placed across a highway, any person lawfully using the highway may remove the obstruction, provided that no breach of the peace is caused thereby. The remedy for a private nuisance is by injunction, action for damages or abatement. An action lies in every case for a private nuisance; it also lies where the nuisance is public, provided that the plaintiff can prove that he has sustained some special injury. In such a case, the civil is in addition to the criminal remedy. In abating a private nuisance, care must be taken not to do more damage than is necessary for the removal of the nuisance. In Scotland, there's no recognized distinction between public and private nuisances. The law as to what constitutes a nuisance is substantially the same as in England. A list of statutory nuisances will be found in the Public Health (Scotland) Act 1867, and amending acts. The remedy for nuisance is by interdict, or action. See also * Aldred's Case * Haslem v.

It is part of the City University of New York system.  History  The college was established in 1957 through the efforts of civic-minded groups who felt that there was a growing need for more higher education facilities in the Bronx. Classes began at Hunter College, and later at the former site of the Bronx High School of Science. In 1973, the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York acquired the University Heights campus from New York University (NYU), which had sold the campus under threat of imminent bankruptcy. Beginning in the fall of that year, the BCC moved its operations to the site overlooking the Harlem River. In 2012, the North Hall and Library opened. The building is designed to resemble many of the historic buildings on campus, and on one end is located next to an entrance of the Hall of Fame for Great Americans. Academics The college is home to the Center for Sustainable Energy, which was founded in 2003 as an educational resource for students pursuing careers in alternative energy. Bronx Community College offers a wide array of workforce community development and personal enrichment courses and programs through Continuing & Professional Studies.\\"Continuing & Professional Studies\\" on the BCC website CPS also delivers customized training for local employers. CPS works closely with unions, city, state and federal agencies and accepts vouchers and other forms of financial aid for individual students. Since 1987, the college is also the local administrator of the SUNY Bronx Educational Opportunity Center. The SUNY Bronx EOC provides tuition free academic and vocational programs to New Yorkers who qualify and it is funded by the University Center for Academic and Workforce Development (UCAWD) part of the State University of New York.  Campus  The library of Bronx Community College, designed by architect Stanford White, shown in 1904 when the campus was part of New York University; the Hall of Fame for Great Americans arcade is visible to the left and right of the library The BCC campus originally housed New York University's undergraduate college and engineering school - which was absorbed by Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn in 1973 but is once again part of NYU - and was created at a time when a number of prominent local universities had made the move to upper Manhattan and the Bronx in order to build bigger campuses, including Columbia University, and the City College of New York. The campus consists of a mix of Classical revival buildings designed by architect Stanford White in 1892-1901 - including the Hall of Languages, the Cornelius Baker Hall of Philosophy and the Gould Memorial Library - and Brutalist concrete buildings by Marcel Breuer, including Begrisch Hall (1956‚Äì61) and the Colston Residence Hall and Cafeteria (1964). Other buildings - such as South Hall, formerly the Gustav H. Schwab House (1857); Butler Hall, formerly William Henry W. T. Mall House (c.1859); and MacCracken Hall, originally the Loring Andrews House (c.1880) - are repurposed mansions which predate the campus. The original landscaping for the campus was by Vaux & Co.. The complex of Stanford White buildings, judged one of the finest concentrations of Beaux Arts architecture in the US, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2012. The BCC campus is notably home to the Hall of Fame for Great Americans, founded in 1900 by Henry Mitchell MacCracken, Chancellor of NYU from 1891 to 1910. It was the first such hall of fame in the United States. The Hall, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, was also designed by Stanford White, and was established to honor prominent Americans who have had a significant impact on the country's history. It includes bronze busts of Alexander Graham Bell, Eli Whitney, and George Westinghouse along with many others. The Hall has not had any new inductees since 1973. Athletics Bronx Community College teams participate as a member of the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA). The Broncos are a member of the community college section of the City University of New York Athletic Conference (CUNYAC). Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, soccer and track & field; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, track & field and volleyball.

Unlike its other product lines, which used the 64-bit MIPS RISC architecture, the line used Intel Pentium II and III processors and shipped with Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 2000 as its operating system in lieu of IRIX. However, the Visual Workstation 320 and 540 models deviated from the architecture of IBM-compatible PCs by using SGI's ARCS firmware instead of a traditional BIOS, internal components adapted from its MIPS-based products, and other proprietary components that made them incompatible with internal hardware designed for standard PCs and hence unable to run other versions of Microsoft Windows, especially Windows 9x. By contrast, the remaining models in the line are standard PCs, using VIA Technologies chipsets, Nvidia video cards, and standard components. Computer architecture There are two series of the Visual Workstations. All are based on Intel processors; the first series (320 and 540) used SGI's ARCloader PROM and Cobalt video chipset, the remainder are essentially standard PC's. The 320 and 540 use a Unified Memory Architecture (UMA) memory system. This shares the video and system memory and runs them at the same speed, and allows for up to 80 percent of the system ram to be applied to video memory. The allocation is static, however, and is adjusted via a profile. The 320 and 540 also use the onboard Cobalt video adapter, which is SGI's proprietary graphics chipset. The firmware used in these systems is a PROM that enables booting into a graphical subsystem before the OS was loaded. In this regard they resemble the Irix/MIPS line of SGI computers such as the SGI O2. The 320 and 540 also stand out for having Firewire (IEEE 1394) ports, onboard composite/S-video capture, and USB keyboards and mice. They differ from each other in that the 320 is dual Pentium II/III-capable with 1GB maximum system RAM, while the 540 is quad Pentium III Xeon-capable with 2GB maximum system RAM. Both computers use a proprietary DIMM module that is essentially the same as ECC SDRAM PC-100, but in a package one-half normal size. The maximum memory per module is 96MB, and the SGI 320 has twelve memory slots. The Firewire ports that are built into the 320 never functioned. SGI distributed Orange Micro Firewire cards about a year after production commenced, in lieu of fixing the Firewire ports. Both the 320 and 540 are further limited by having PCI slots (albeit two 66 MHz and one 33 MHz slot) that operated at 3.3V, out of step with the 5v slots used by most manufacturers. This limits the number of accessories that can be added. The other Visual Workstations are built to compete with the new Intel processor based workstations that are considerably cheaper than SGI's line of MIPS workstations. They are little more than standard PCs, and use many parts that are also available in the aftermarket. Operating system The 320 and 540 Visual Workstations shipped originally with Microsoft Windows NT 4.0. Due to the ARCloader PROM, a custom Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) for Windows is necessary. Windows 2000 is the last release which included the required SGI-specific HAL. Because of that, and because SGI ceased supporting the Visual Workstation series, installation of later Windows versions such as XP is unsupported. The 230, 330, and 550 also supported Windows NT and 2000. In addition, SGI offered these systems pre-loaded with release 6.2 of the Red Hat Linux distribution. These systems have the letter \\"L\\" appended to their model numbers. Because of the various SGI enhancements, in particular for the 320 and 540, Visual Workstations often out-perform Intel PCs of similar configuration in graphically-intensive or memory bound applications. However, due to the hefty upgrade costs for the non-standard components, it was more cost effective to purchase an entire new higher-spec non-SGI PC rather than purchase upgrades to a Visual Workstation. Displays and matching monitor All the Visual Workstations support conventional CRT monitors and have VGA display connectors. As the 230 330, and 550 models use Nvidia Quadro cards they also support DVI. The SGI 320 and 540 models shipped with the groundbreaking and stylistically matched 1600SW LCD display, using an OpenLDI display connector that requires an accessory flat panel adapter. The SGI O2 also supports the 1600SW with an adapter. Models and configurations The model numbers of the Visual Workstations: *Visual Workstation 320 - Dual processor Pentium II/III (Slot1) *Visual Workstation 540 - Quad processor Pentium II/III Xeon (Slot2) *Visual Workstation 230/230L - Single processor Pentium III (FCPGA Socket370) *Visual Workstation 330/330L - Dual processor Pentium II/III (FCPGA Socket370) *Visual Workstation 550/550L - Dual processor Pentium III Xeon (Slot2) ** Visual Workstations were initially equipped with either a single Pentium II or Pentium III processor or dual (SMP) Pentium III processors. The 540 and 550 models support the Xeon implementation of the Pentium series, and could support up to four Xeons in an SMP configuration (only two for the 550). Although no SGI Visual Workstation was ever released with a CPU running higher than 700 MHz, some hobbyists have been able to run faster processors. For the SGI 320, the limit is dual 1 GHz Pentium III processors or a single 1.4 GHz Celeron. Dual 1 GHz processors require a specific model of CPU, which is intended for Intel servers. Further, the voltage regulator, PROM, and revision of the motherboard also have to be correct for the setup to work. With single processors the Powerleap Pl-iP3T \\"slocket\\" adapter and a Tualatin 1.4 GHz celeron processor is the limit, and is a straight bolt-in installation. The Tualatin core gives a more modern processor, and the Powerleap adapter handles the voltage regulation to the CPU. The SGI 540 has been reported to handle up to 900 MHz quad Xeon processors. These are the fastest Pentium 3 Xeons with the 100 MHz front side bus speed of the 540. The 230, 330, and 550 models are essentially standard PCs and has the same capabilities and upgrade limits as other PCs of the time. The 230 and 330 are based on VIA chipsets, used socket 370 processors, and conventional SDRAM. The 550 used Slot 2 Xeon processors, the Intel 840 chipset, and RDRAM. These three models have a generic PC BIOS, generic PC memory, and other non-differentiated parts. The video cards these systems used are Nvidia AGP cards based on the Quadro 2 chipset, and differ from aftermarket Quadros in their drivers.

The objective of such differentiation is generally associated with assigning priorities to the data payload or access levels to the telephone call. Data services As related to network technology, CoS is a 3-bit field that is present in an Ethernet frame header when 802.1Q VLAN tagging is present. The field specifies a priority value between 0 and 7, more commonly known as CS0 through CS7, that can be used by quality of service (QoS) disciplines to differentiate and shape/police network traffic. CoS operates only on 802.1Q VLAN Ethernet at the data link layer (layer 2), while other QoS mechanisms (such as DiffServ, also known as DSCP) operate at the IP network layer (layer 3) or use a local QoS tagging system that does not modify the actual packet, such as Cisco's \\"QoS-Group\\". Network devices (i.e. routers, switches, etc.) can be configured to use existing CoS values on incoming packets from other devices (trust mode), or can rewrite the CoS value to something completely different. Most Internet Service Providers do not trust incoming QoS markings from their customers, so CoS is generally limited to use within an organization's intranet. Service providers offering private-line WAN services will typically offer services which can utilize CoS/QoS. Voice services As related to legacy telephone systems, COS is often used to define the permissions an extension will have on a PBX or Centrex. The Class of Service acronym is normally written as COS vs. CoS as is often used in data networking parlance. Certain groups of users may have a need for extended voicemail message retention while another group may need the ability to forward calls to a cell phone, and still others have no need to make calls outside the office. Permissions for a group of extensions can be changed by modifying a COS variable applied to the entire group. COS is also used on trunks to define if they are full-duplex, incoming only, or outgoing only. Classification of service The term can be used generically to refer to the classification of network traffic within network equipment based on packet inspection. Cisco implements such classification through either access-lists or Network-Based Application Recognition (NBAR).

Random decision forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set. Random forests generally outperform decision trees, but their accuracy is lower than gradient boosted trees. However, data characteristics can affect their performance. The first algorithm for random decision forests was created by Tin Kam Ho using the random subspace method, which, in Ho's formulation, is a way to implement the \\"stochastic discrimination\\" approach to classification proposed by Eugene Kleinberg. An extension of the algorithm was developed by Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler, who registeredU.S. trademark registration number 3185828, registered 2006/12/19. \\"Random Forests\\" as a trademark (, owned by Minitab, Inc.). The extension combines Breiman's \\"bagging\\" idea and random selection of features, introduced first by Ho and later independently by Amit and Geman in order to construct a collection of decision trees with controlled variance. Random forests are frequently used as \\"blackbox\\" models in businesses, as they generate reasonable predictions across a wide range of data while requiring little configuration in packages such as scikit-learn.  History  The general method of random decision forests was first proposed by Ho in 1995. Ho established that forests of trees splitting with oblique hyperplanes can gain accuracy as they grow without suffering from overtraining, as long as the forests are randomly restricted to be sensitive to only selected feature dimensions. A subsequent work along the same lines concluded that other splitting methods behave similarly, as long as they are randomly forced to be insensitive to some feature dimensions. Note that this observation of a more complex classifier (a larger forest) getting more accurate nearly monotonically is in sharp contrast to the common belief that the complexity of a classifier can only grow to a certain level of accuracy before being hurt by overfitting. The explanation of the forest method's resistance to overtraining can be found in Kleinberg's theory of stochastic discrimination. The early development of Breiman's notion of random forests was influenced by the work of Amit and Geman who introduced the idea of searching over a random subset of the available decisions when splitting a node, in the context of growing a single tree. The idea of random subspace selection from Ho was also influential in the design of random forests. In this method a forest of trees is grown, and variation among the trees is introduced by projecting the training data into a randomly chosen subspace before fitting each tree or each node. Finally, the idea of randomized node optimization, where the decision at each node is selected by a randomized procedure, rather than a deterministic optimization was first introduced by Dietterich. The introduction of random forests proper was first made in a paper by Leo Breiman. This paper describes a method of building a forest of uncorrelated trees using a CART like procedure, combined with randomized node optimization and bagging. In addition, this paper combines several ingredients, some previously known and some novel, which form the basis of the modern practice of random forests, in particular: # Using out-of-bag error as an estimate of the generalization error. # Measuring variable importance through permutation. The report also offers the first theoretical result for random forests in the form of a bound on the generalization error which depends on the strength of the trees in the forest and their correlation. Algorithm =Preliminaries: decision tree learning= Decision trees are a popular method for various machine learning tasks. Tree learning \\"come[s] closest to meeting the requirements for serving as an off-the-shelf procedure for data mining\\", say Hastie et al., \\"because it is invariant under scaling and various other transformations of feature values, is robust to inclusion of irrelevant features, and produces inspectable models. However, they are seldom accurate\\". In particular, trees that are grown very deep tend to learn highly irregular patterns: they overfit their training sets, i.e. have low bias, but very high variance. Random forests are a way of averaging multiple deep decision trees, trained on different parts of the same training set, with the goal of reducing the variance. This comes at the expense of a small increase in the bias and some loss of interpretability, but generally greatly boosts the performance in the final model. Forests are like the pulling together of decision tree algorithm efforts. Taking the teamwork of many trees thus improving the performance of a single random tree. Though not quite similar, forests give the effects of a K-fold cross validation. =Bagging= The training algorithm for random forests applies the general technique of bootstrap aggregating, or bagging, to tree learners. Given a training set = , ..., with responses = , ..., , bagging repeatedly (B times) selects a random sample with replacement of the training set and fits trees to these samples: : For = 1, ..., : :# Sample, with replacement, training examples from , ; call these , . :# Train a classification or regression tree on , . After training, predictions for unseen samples can be made by averaging the predictions from all the individual regression trees on : :\\\\hat{f} = \\\\frac{1}{B} \\\\sum_{b=1}^Bf_b (x') or by taking the majority vote in the case of classification trees. This bootstrapping procedure leads to better model performance because it decreases the variance of the model, without increasing the bias. This means that while the predictions of a single tree are highly sensitive to noise in its training set, the average of many trees is not, as long as the trees are not correlated. Simply training many trees on a single training set would give strongly correlated trees (or even the same tree many times, if the training algorithm is deterministic); bootstrap sampling is a way of de-correlating the trees by showing them different training sets. Additionally, an estimate of the uncertainty of the prediction can be made as the standard deviation of the predictions from all the individual regression trees on : :\\\\sigma = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{b=1}^B (f_b(x') - \\\\hat{f})^2}{B-1} }. The number of samples/trees, , is a free parameter. Typically, a few hundred to several thousand trees are used, depending on the size and nature of the training set. An optimal number of trees can be found using cross-validation, or by observing the out-of-bag error: the mean prediction error on each training sample , using only the trees that did not have in their bootstrap sample. The training and test error tend to level off after some number of trees have been fit. =From bagging to random forests= The above procedure describes the original bagging algorithm for trees. Random forests differ in only one way from this general scheme: they use a modified tree learning algorithm that selects, at each candidate split in the learning process, a random subset of the features. This process is sometimes called \\"feature bagging\\". The reason for doing this is the correlation of the trees in an ordinary bootstrap sample: if one or a few features are very strong predictors for the response variable (target output), these features will be selected in many of the trees, causing them to become correlated. An analysis of how bagging and random subspace projection contribute to accuracy gains under different conditions is given by Ho. Typically, for a classification problem with features, (rounded down) features are used in each split. For regression problems the inventors recommend (rounded down) with a minimum node size of 5 as the default. In practice the best values for these parameters will depend on the problem, and they should be treated as tuning parameters. =ExtraTrees= Adding one further step of randomization yields extremely randomized trees, or ExtraTrees. While similar to ordinary random forests in that they are an ensemble of individual trees, there are two main differences: first, each tree is trained using the whole learning sample (rather than a bootstrap sample), and second, the top-down splitting in the tree learner is randomized. Instead of computing the locally optimal cut-point for each feature under consideration (based on, e.g., information gain or the Gini impurity), a random cut-point is selected. This value is selected from a uniform distribution within the feature's empirical range (in the tree's training set). Then, of all the randomly generated splits, the split that yields the highest score is chosen to split the node. Similar to ordinary random forests, the number of randomly selected features to be considered at each node can be specified. Default values for this parameter are \\\\sqrt{p} for classification and p for regression, where p is the number of features in the model. Properties = Variable importance = Random forests can be used to rank the importance of variables in a regression or classification problem in a natural way. The following technique was described in Breiman's original paper and is implemented in the R package randomForest. The first step in measuring the variable importance in a data set \\\\mathcal{D}_n =\\\\\\\\{(X_i, Y_i)\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^n is to fit a random forest to the data. During the fitting process the out-of-bag error for each data point is recorded and averaged over the forest (errors on an independent test set can be substituted if bagging is not used during training). To measure the importance of the j-th feature after training, the values of the j-th feature are permuted among the training data and the out-of-bag error is again computed on this perturbed data set. The importance score for the j-th feature is computed by averaging the difference in out-of-bag error before and after the permutation over all trees. The score is normalized by the standard deviation of these differences. Features which produce large values for this score are ranked as more important than features which produce small values. The statistical definition of the variable importance measure was given and analyzed by Zhu et al. This method of determining variable importance has some drawbacks. For data including categorical variables with different number of levels, random forests are biased in favor of those attributes with more levels. Methods such as partial permutations and growing unbiased trees can be used to solve the problem. If the data contain groups of correlated features of similar relevance for the output, then smaller groups are favored over larger groups. = Relationship to nearest neighbors = A relationship between random forests and the -nearest neighbor algorithm (-NN) was pointed out by Lin and Jeon in 2002. It turns out that both can be viewed as so-called weighted neighborhoods schemes. These are models built from a training set \\\\\\\\{(x_i, y_i)\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^n that make predictions \\\\hat{y} for new points by looking at the \\"neighborhood\\" of the point, formalized by a weight function : :\\\\hat{y} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n W(x_i, x') \\\\, y_i. Here, W(x_i, x') is the non-negative weight of the 'th training point relative to the new point in the same tree. For any particular , the weights for points x_i must sum to one. Weight functions are given as follows: * In -NN, the weights are W(x_i, x') = \\\\frac{1}{k} if is one of the points closest to , and zero otherwise. * In a tree, W(x_i, x') = \\\\frac{1}{k'} if is one of the points in the same leaf as , and zero otherwise. Since a forest averages the predictions of a set of trees with individual weight functions W_j, its predictions are :\\\\hat{y} = \\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\sum_{j=1}^m\\\\sum_{i=1}^n W_{j}(x_i, x') \\\\, y_i = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\sum_{j=1}^m W_{j}(x_i, x')\\\\right) \\\\, y_i. This shows that the whole forest is again a weighted neighborhood scheme, with weights that average those of the individual trees. The neighbors of in this interpretation are the points x_i sharing the same leaf in any tree j. In this way, the neighborhood of depends in a complex way on the structure of the trees, and thus on the structure of the training set. Lin and Jeon show that the shape of the neighborhood used by a random forest adapts to the local importance of each feature.  Unsupervised learning with random forests  As part of their construction, random forest predictors naturally lead to a dissimilarity measure among the observations. One can also define a random forest dissimilarity measure between unlabeled data: the idea is to construct a random forest predictor that distinguishes the ‚Äúobserved‚Äù data from suitably generated synthetic data. The observed data are the original unlabeled data and the synthetic data are drawn from a reference distribution. A random forest dissimilarity can be attractive because it handles mixed variable types very well, is invariant to monotonic transformations of the input variables, and is robust to outlying observations. The random forest dissimilarity easily deals with a large number of semi-continuous variables due to its intrinsic variable selection; for example, the \\"Addcl 1\\" random forest dissimilarity weighs the contribution of each variable according to how dependent it is on other variables. The random forest dissimilarity has been used in a variety of applications, e.g. to find clusters of patients based on tissue marker data.  Variants  Instead of decision trees, linear models have been proposed and evaluated as base estimators in random forests, in particular multinomial logistic regression and naive Bayes classifiers. Kernel random forest In machine learning, kernel random forests establish the connection between random forests and kernel methods. By slightly modifying their definition, random forests can be rewritten as kernel methods, which are more interpretable and easier to analyze. = History = Leo Breiman was the first person to notice the link between random forest and kernel methods. He pointed out that random forests which are grown using i.i.d. random vectors in the tree construction are equivalent to a kernel acting on the true margin. Lin and Jeon established the connection between random forests and adaptive nearest neighbor, implying that random forests can be seen as adaptive kernel estimates. Davies and Ghahramani proposed Random Forest Kernel and show that it can empirically outperform state-of-art kernel methods. Scornet first defined KeRF estimates and gave the explicit link between KeRF estimates and random forest. He also gave explicit expressions for kernels based on centered random forest and uniform random forest, two simplified models of random forest. He named these two KeRFs Centered KeRF and Uniform KeRF, and proved upper bounds on their rates of consistency. = Notations and definitions =  Preliminaries: Centered forests  Centered forest is a simplified model for Breiman's original random forest, which uniformly selects an attribute among all attributes and performs splits at the center of the cell along the pre-chosen attribute. The algorithm stops when a fully binary tree of level k is built, where k \\\\in\\\\mathbb{N} is a parameter of the algorithm.  Uniform forest  Uniform forest is another simplified model for Breiman's original random forest, which uniformly selects a feature among all features and performs splits at a point uniformly drawn on the side of the cell, along the preselected feature.  From random forest to KeRF  Given a training sample \\\\mathcal{D}_n =\\\\\\\\{(\\\\mathbf{X}_i, Y_i)\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^n of [0,1]^p\\\\times\\\\mathbb{R}-valued independent random variables distributed as the independent prototype pair (\\\\mathbf{X}, Y), where \\\\operatorname{E}[Y^2]<\\\\infty. We aim at predicting the response Y, associated with the random variable \\\\mathbf{X}, by estimating the regression function m(\\\\mathbf{x})=\\\\operatorname{E}[Y \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{X} = \\\\mathbf{x}]. A random regression forest is an ensemble of M randomized regression trees. Denote m_n(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{\\\\Theta}_j) the predicted value at point \\\\mathbf{x} by the j-th tree, where \\\\mathbf{\\\\Theta}_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\mathbf{\\\\Theta}_M are independent random variables, distributed as a generic random variable \\\\mathbf{\\\\Theta}, independent of the sample \\\\mathcal{D}_n. This random variable can be used to describe the randomness induced by node splitting and the sampling procedure for tree construction. The trees are combined to form the finite forest estimate m_{M, n}(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\Theta_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\Theta_M) = \\\\frac{1}{M}\\\\sum_{j=1}^M m_n(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\Theta_j). For regression trees, we have m_n = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\frac{Y_i\\\\mathbf{1}_{\\\\mathbf{X}_i\\\\in A_n(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\Theta_j)}}{N_n(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\Theta_j)}, where A_n(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\Theta_j) is the cell containing \\\\mathbf{x}, designed with randomness \\\\Theta_j and dataset \\\\mathcal{D}_n, and N_n(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\Theta_j) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\mathbf{1}_{\\\\mathbf{X}_i\\\\in A_n(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\Theta_j)}. Thus random forest estimates satisfy, for all \\\\mathbf{x}\\\\in[0,1]^d, m_{M,n}(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\Theta_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\Theta_M) =\\\\frac{1}{M}\\\\sum_{j=1}^M \\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\frac{Y_i\\\\mathbf{1}_{\\\\mathbf{X}_i\\\\in A_n(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\Theta_j)}}{N_n(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\Theta_j)}\\\\right). Random regression forest has two level of averaging, first over the samples in the target cell of a tree, then over all trees. Thus the contributions of observations that are in cells with a high density of data points are smaller than that of observations which belong to less populated cells. In order to improve the random forest methods and compensate the misestimation, Scornet defined KeRF by : \\\\tilde{m}_{M,n}(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\Theta_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\Theta_M) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sum_{j=1}^M N_n(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\Theta_j)}\\\\sum_{j=1}^M\\\\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i\\\\mathbf{1}_{\\\\mathbf{X}_i\\\\in A_n(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\Theta_j)}, which is equal to the mean of the Y_i's falling in the cells containing \\\\mathbf{x} in the forest. If we define the connection function of the M finite forest as K_{M,n}(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{z}) = \\\\frac{1}{M} \\\\sum_{j=1}^M \\\\mathbf{1}_{\\\\mathbf{z} \\\\in A_n (\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\Theta_j)}, i.e. the proportion of cells shared between \\\\mathbf{x} and \\\\mathbf{z}, then almost surely we have \\\\tilde{m}_{M,n}(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\Theta_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\Theta_M) = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i K_{M,n}(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{x}_i)}{\\\\sum_{\\\\ell=1}^n K_{M,n}(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{x}_{\\\\ell})}, which defines the KeRF.  Centered KeRF  The construction of Centered KeRF of level k is the same as for centered forest, except that predictions are made by \\\\tilde{m}_{M,n}(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\Theta_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\Theta_M) , the corresponding kernel function, or connection function is : \\\\begin{align} K_k^{cc}(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{z}) = \\\\sum_{k_1,\\\\ldots,k_d, \\\\sum_{j=1}^d k_j=k} & \\\\frac{k!}{k_1!\\\\cdots k_d!} \\\\left(\\\\frac 1 d \\\\right)^k \\\\prod_{j=1}^d\\\\mathbf{1}_{\\\\lceil2^{k_j}x_j\\\\rceil=\\\\lceil2^{k_j}z_j\\\\rceil}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\text{ for all } \\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{z}\\\\in[0,1]^d. \\\\end{align}  Uniform KeRF  Uniform KeRF is built in the same way as uniform forest, except that predictions are made by \\\\tilde{m}_{M,n}(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\Theta_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\Theta_M) , the corresponding kernel function, or connection function is :K_k^{uf}(\\\\mathbf{0},\\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\sum_{k_1,\\\\ldots,k_d, \\\\sum_{j=1}^d k_j=k} \\\\frac{k!}{k_1!\\\\ldots k_d!}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{d}\\\\right)^k \\\\prod_{m=1}^d\\\\left(1-x_m\\\\sum_{j=0}^{k_m-1}\\\\frac{(-\\\\lnx_m)^j}{j!}\\\\right) \\\\text{ for all } \\\\mathbf{x}\\\\in[0,1]^d. = Properties =  Relation between KeRF and random forest  Predictions given by KeRF and random forests are close if the number of points in each cell is controlled: > Assume that there exist sequences (a_n),(b_n) such that, almost surely, : > a_n\\\\leq N_n(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\Theta)\\\\leq b_n \\\\text{ and } a_n\\\\leq \\\\frac 1 M > \\\\sum_{m=1}^M N_n {\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\Theta_m}\\\\leq b_n. Then almost surely, > :m_{M,n}(\\\\mathbf{x}) - \\\\tilde{m}_{M,n}(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\le\\\\frac{b_n-a_n}{a_n} > \\\\tilde{m}_{M,n}(\\\\mathbf{x}).  Relation between infinite KeRF and infinite random forest  When the number of trees M goes to infinity, then we have infinite random forest and infinite KeRF. Their estimates are close if the number of observations in each cell is bounded: > Assume that there exist sequences (\\\\varepsilon_n), (a_n),(b_n) such that, > almost surely * \\\\operatorname{E}[N_n(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\Theta)] \\\\ge 1, * > \\\\operatorname{P}[a_n\\\\le N_n(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\Theta) \\\\le b_n\\\\mid \\\\mathcal{D}_n] > \\\\ge 1-\\\\varepsilon_n/2, * \\\\operatorname{P}[a_n\\\\le \\\\operatorname{E}_\\\\Theta > [N_n(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\Theta)] \\\\le b_n\\\\mid \\\\mathcal{D}_n] \\\\ge 1-\\\\varepsilon_n/2, > Then almost surely, : > m_{\\\\infty,n}(\\\\mathbf{x})-\\\\tilde{m}_{\\\\infty,n}(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\le \\\\frac{b_n- > a_n}{a_n}\\\\tilde{m}_{\\\\infty,n}(\\\\mathbf{x}) + n \\\\varepsilon_n \\\\left( > \\\\max_{1\\\\le i\\\\le n} Y_i \\\\right). = Consistency results = Assume that Y = m(\\\\mathbf{X}) + \\\\varepsilon, where \\\\varepsilon is a centered Gaussian noise, independent of \\\\mathbf{X}, with finite variance \\\\sigma^2<\\\\infty. Moreover, \\\\mathbf{X} is uniformly distributed on [0,1]^d and m is Lipschitz. Scornet proved upper bounds on the rates of consistency for centered KeRF and uniform KeRF.  Consistency of centered KeRF  Providing k\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty and n/2^k\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty, there exists a constant C_1>0 such that, for all n, \\\\mathbb{E}[\\\\tilde{m}_n^{cc}(\\\\mathbf{X}) - m(\\\\mathbf{X})]^2 \\\\le C_1 n^{-1/(3+d\\\\log 2)}(\\\\log n)^2.  Consistency of uniform KeRF  Providing k\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty and n/2^k\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty, there exists a constant C>0 such that, \\\\mathbb{E}[\\\\tilde{m}_n^{uf}(\\\\mathbf{X})-m(\\\\mathbf{X})]^2\\\\le Cn^{-2/(6+3d\\\\log2)}(\\\\log n)^2.

(SGI). SGI first announced the system in July 1991.http://www.sgistuff.net/hardware/systems/indigo.html The Indigo is considered one of the most capable graphics workstations of its era, and was essentially peerless in the realm of hardware-accelerated three-dimensional graphics rendering. For use as a graphics workstation, the Indigo was equipped with a two-dimensional framebuffer or, for use as a 3D graphics workstation, with the Elan graphics subsystem including one to four Geometry Engines (GEs). SGI sold a server version with no video adapter. The Indigo's design is based on a simple cube motif in indigo hue. Graphics and other peripheral expansions are accomplished via the GIO32 expansion bus. The Indigo was superseded generally by the SGI Indigo2, and in the low-cost market segment by the SGI Indy.  Technical specifications  The first Indigo model, code-named \\"Hollywood\\", was introduced on July 22, 1991. It is based on the IP12 processor board, which contains a 32-bit MIPS R3000A microprocessor soldered on the board and proprietary memory slots supporting up to 96 MB of RAM. The later version (codename Blackjack) is based on the IP20 processor board, which has a removable processor module (PM1 or PM2) containing a 64-bit MIPS R4000 (100 MHz) or R4400 processor (100 MHz or 150 MHz) that implements the MIPS-III instruction set. The IP20 uses standard 72-pin SIMMs with parity, and has 12 SIMM slots for a total of 384 MB of RAM at maximum. A Motorola 56000 DSP is used for Audio IO, giving it 4-channel 16-bit audio. Ethernet is supported on board by the SEEQ 80c03 chipset coupled with the HPC (High-performance Peripheral Controller), which provides the DMA engine. The HPC interfaces primarily between the GIObus and the Ethernet, SCSI (wd33c93 chipset) and the 56000 DSP. The GIO bus interface is implemented by the PIC (Processor Interface Controller) on IP12 and MC (Memory Controller) on IP20. Much of the hardware design can be traced back to the SGI IRIS 4D/3x series, which shared the same memory controller, Ethernet, SCSI, and optionally DSP as the IP12 Indigo. The 4D/30, 4D/35 and Indigo R3000 are all considered IP12 machines and run the same IRIX kernel. The Indigo R3000 is effectively a reduced cost 4D/35 without a VME bus. The PIC supports a VME expansion bus (used on the 4D/3x series) and GIO expansion slots (used on the Indigo). In all IP12, IP20, and IP22/IP24 (see SGI Indigo2) systems the HPC attached to the GIO bus.  Graphics options  =Entry graphics= For entry graphics, the 8-bit color frame bufferhttp://www.futuretech.blinkenlights.nl/indigo.html comes in three versions. One version uses the system's GIO expansion bus. Another uses the main backplane like the XS, XZ, and Elan graphics options. The final is the same, but adds a second video output, giving the computer the ability to have two \\"heads\\", or monitors. = XS Graphics = The Indigo's XS Graphics option has a single GE7 Geometry Engine (GE), a RE3 Raster engine, a HQ2 Command engine, VC1, XMAP5. It is ideal for low-cost wireframe operations, compared to more powerful, and expensive options for textured graphics. Part of SGI's Express line of graphics, four XS graphics options were produced for the Indigo: the XS-8 offers 8-bit color, with one VM2 video RAM module; the XS-Z adds the ZB-4 Z buffer; the XS-24 adds two VM2 modules and offers 24 color bits and 32 bits including brightness; and the XS-24Z adds a Z buffer. = XZ Graphics = The XZ graphics option is also a member of SGI's Express graphics line. It is similar to the XS-24z, but it includes a second GE7 Geometry Engine ASIC, doubling its geometry performance. = Elan Graphics = The highest performance graphics option offered for the Indigo, it is a member of SGI's Express graphics line. It is like the XS-24z and XZ, but has 4 GE7 Geometry Engine ASICs, giving it twice the performance of the XZ option.  Operating system  The Indigo was designed to run IRIX, SGI's version of Unix. The Indigos with R3000 processors are supported up to IRIX version 5.3, and Indigo equipped with an R4000 or R4400 processor can run up to IRIX 6.5.22. Additionally, the free Unix-like operating system NetBSD has support for both the IP12 and IP20 Indigos as part of the sgimips port.

A typical beginner's project. Model engineering is the pursuit of constructing proportionally-scaled miniature working representations of full-sized machines. It is a branch of metalworking with a strong emphasis on artisanry, as opposed to mass production. While now mainly a hobby, in the past it also had commercial and industrial purpose. The term 'model engineering' was in use by 1888. In the United States, the term 'home shop machinist' is often used instead, although arguably the scope of this term is broader. Model engineering is most popular in the industrialised countries that have an engineering heritage extending back to the days of steam power. That is, it is a pursuit principally found in the UK, USA, northwestern European countries and the industrialised British Commonwealth countries. Scope of model engineering The 'classic' areas of model engineering interest are live steam models (typically steam locomotives, stationary engines and traction engines), internal combustion engines, and clock making. Other popular subjects are Stirling engines, workshop equipment, miniature machine tools and ornamental turning. These constitute stable genres which are often reflected in competition categories at model engineering exhibitions. In the past, amateur electrical experimentation (the precursor to hobby electronics) and ship modelling were considered as part of model engineering, but these are no longer regarded as core genres. Model engineers typically make models by machining working parts from stock metal and metal castings. Some models are intended as utilitarian working models, others as highly meticulous display models, or sometimes a combination of both. The most elaborate models involve hand manufacture of thousands of parts, taking thousands of hours to complete, often over a number of years or even decades. The model engineer is often guided by commercially available drawings, however some draw their own designs, or even work without drawings. Similarly, most model engineers will buy castings when required, but some buy or make foundry equipment to cast metal themselves. Increasingly, 'modern' technologies such as Computer aided design, cnc (computer numerical control) equipment, laser cutting, 3D printing and embedded systems are becoming part of the hobby as more and more of its practitioners have developed skills and familiarity with these techniques through their work, whilst younger people familiar with newer processes discover the potential of traditional machining, narrowing the gap between 'model engineering' and 'maker culture'. As an activity that involves extensive use of metalwork machine tools in a home workshop-based context, model engineering overlaps with other artisanal machine-tool based and allied metalwork pursuits including gunsmithing (particularly in the USA), manufacture of home metalworking tools and accessories, home cnc equipment building, antique machine tool collecting, antique vehicle and machine restoration, home welding and hobby metalcasting. Model engineering is closely associated with the hobby of running live steam locomotives, and overlaps to a degree with the making of non-working models, particularly those of mechanical subjects. Products such as Meccano and low-pressure toy steam engines have a loose affinity with model engineering, stemming from the production of scientific and mechanical toys beginning in the late 18th century. Steam Punk, a post-industrial sculptural art style picking up on the aesthetic and kinetic qualities of old machinery, shares some overlap. There is some debate about the appropriateness of the term 'model engineering'. Some argue that the term 'engineer' should be reserved solely for those professionally qualified as such. However, the historic meaning of 'engineer' is one who constructs or tends engines, and as such is a fitting epithet for those who make working models as a hobby. In any case, since the term 'model engineer' was employed by 1888, the precedent for its use has long been a fait accompli. Model live steam locomotives A more demanding model engineering project, a propane fired 1:8 scale live steam train, running on the Finnish Railway Museum's miniature 7.25\\" (184 mm) track. Model live steam locomotives predominate as the most popular modelling subject in model engineering. As such they deserve special mention. Live steam refers to the use of pressurised steam, heated in the model locomotive's own boiler, to turn the wheels via miniature steam cylinders. Not all locomotives are live steam - some model engineers make model locomotives powered by electricity or internal combustion engines. The criteria however is that the model is self-propelled, hence requiring an engine to be made or motor to be installed, as opposed to the (usually much smaller) model trains that rely on an electrified track to run. Live steam (and other self-propelled) locomotives are made in a range of sizes, or scales, according to track gauge. The smaller gauges, sometimes called 'garden gauges' because they can be set up in the owner's own garden, or in the US called a backyard railroad, are sufficient to run by themselves but usually cannot haul the driver or passengers. The larger gauges are usually found on club tracks or miniature railways, and are intended to haul the driver and passengers. Popular 'garden gauges' are '0' gauge, '1' gauge and 2¬Ω\\" gauge (ridable). Usual club track gauges are 3¬Ω\\", 5\\" and 7¬º\\", and 4¬æ\\" and 7¬Ω\\" in North America. Larger miniature railway gauges such as 10¬º\\" and 15\\" gauge are more common in zoo and park settings. Various gauges have existed over time. 3¬Ω\\" and 5\\" gauge were proposed in 1898 as standard model gauges, although 5\\" gauge only became popular after the Second World War, along with 7¬º\\" gauge. Not all model live steam locomotive enthusiasts are model engineers (and vice versa). There are many live steam enthusiasts who prefer running the models on a track rather than spending long hours building them in a workshop, and so purchase a ready made model locomotive. However, for many the joy of the hobby lies in the manufacturing process, ending in the great satisfaction of a running engine of any sort, which can be immense. Model engineering in society Model engineering, c.1866. Apprentice mechanic John Satchell poses with his father and his medal-winning model shunting locomotive exhibited at the 1866-67 Intercolonial Exhibition, Victoria, Australia. Image: Museum of Victoria ST037829 The aim of model engineering to build mechanical models is now usually purely recreational, although beginning with the industrial revolution in the late 18th century through to the late 20th century such models were widely produced as aids to technical education, either as apprentice projects or as classroom or public institutional exhibits. They were also produced as commercial props to support a patent, to visualise a proposed capital venture, or to advertise a manufacturer's trade. Many museums in the old industrialised countries house original collections of mechanical models stemming from the earliest days of the industrial revolution. One of the earliest known models of a steam engine, that of a Newcomen beam engine, was made prior to 1763. The Science Museum, London published catalogues illustrating many early models. Many of these models represent the same subjects that remain popular with model engineers today, which attests to the long tradition of model engineering. The earliest publication to offer instruction to the public on building working steam engine models was the Model Dockyard Handy-book (2nd edition 1867) by E. Bell, proprietor of the Model Dockyard shop in London, which also offered the parts and completed models for sale. Bell was, he said, \\"Ship Modeller and Mechanist\\" to the Royal Family, the English Admiralty and various European royalty. The book was aimed at building and operating these models as a recreational pursuit. In Britain, the establishment of a broad middle class by the late nineteenth century, an associated widening of leisure pursuits, and the rise of the Arts and Crafts movement that valorized handicrafts, saw a new constituency of amateur model engineers and experimenters interested in metalwork as a recreation. This was at a time when mechanical technology was seen as the driving force in rising economic prosperity. Articles and advertisements relating to model engineering began to appear in Amateur Work Illustrated magazine in the mid 1880s. With the rise of 'amateur' interest in conjunction with the working class mechanics who made models as apprentices, a new market niche was emerging, capitalised upon by Percival Marshall who began publishing Model Engineer and Amateur Electrician magazine in 1898 (now Model Engineer). Common interest in model engineering between men of lower, middle and even upper classes supported claims that model engineering had broken class barriers. However, a tradition that still persists is the use of pseudonyms in the model engineering press, as it was once considered inappropriate for professional gentlemen to contribute to \\"amateur\\" journals. Another reason was to disguise the fact that one contributor was single-handedly writing an entire edition of a journal on occasion, notably Edgar T Westbury, who used no less than four nom des plumes Model engineering remains popular despite major social changes over the past century. Among these changes have been the elimination of steam power (still the most favourite subject for model engineers) from rail transport and industry; and the widespread de-industrialisation of Western countries beginning in the 1970s, along with a shift to consumer society and the introduction of a wide new range of competing leisure pursuits. These changes, along with the older age of many model engineers and decline of new apprenticeships, have prompted a long-running debate among model engineers whether the hobby will die out. Model engineers often join together to form model engineering clubs and societies. The first of these to form was the Society of Model and Experimental Engineers based in London, UK, in 1898, \\"along similar lines to the model yachting clubs\\" then popular. By 1948, \\"well over a hundred local clubs and societies\\" had been formed. Model engineering clubs and societies now number in the hundreds across the UK, Canada, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, Netherlands, Switzerland and elsewhere. These clubs are a form of civil society organisation, which are a sign of healthy democracy and community cohesion. A major focus for many of these clubs is the operation of a club track or miniature railway for members' model live steam locomotives. These tracks are often run publicly and form part of community recreational and tourism infrastructure in their local area. Model engineering clubs and societies often cater too for model engineering interests beyond locomotives. Due to the inherently dangerous nature of live steam, clubs and societies are responsible for administering safety regulations, insurance and specialist boiler codes that cover both members and the public. To this end, model engineering clubs and societies often affiliate into national bodies that can lobby government to maintain the historical privilege they have to self-regulate their own safety standards. Livelihoods based on model engineering include retailers who provide model engineers with equipment and supplies, small fabrication services who produce castings, make miniature live steam boilers and live steam kit parts (or even whole running models), commercial publishers in the model engineering press, and a very few professional model engineers who make one-off models by commission for private or institutional collectors. Most model engineers however are amateur constructors who rely on other income. Notable model engineers Each year, many local and regional model engineering shows and exhibitions are held wherever clubs are found, which recognize the best work of model engineers. The largest exhibitions are held in London, Harrogate and Bristol in the UK. In the UK, the Duke of Edinburgh Challenge Trophy, awarded annually at the Model Engineer Exhibition, reflects some of the best of the hobby. Pre-eminent among the Trophy's recipients is nine-time winner Cherry Hill. On the web, the quality of some modern model engineers' work is celebrated at The Internet Craftsmanship Museum. Many of the best-known names in model engineering are of those who wrote prolifically in the model engineering press. Henry Greenly may be the first notable model engineer, being founding editor of Model Railways and Locomotives Magazine in 1902 and author of Model Engineering and related books. Greenly produced a number of designs for spirit-fuelled model locomotives, which however could not haul passengers. Arguably the most notable model engineer of all was the obscure 'LBSC' (Lillian \\"Curly\\" Lawrence). His most significant contribution was to overturn Greenly's prevailing orthodoxy and demonstrate that model locomotives of even small gauge (2¬Ω\\") could be powerful enough to haul passengers, by using miniature coal-fired firetube boilers, as were used in full-size locomotives. From 1923 until his death in 1967 he popularized passenger-hauling miniature live steam locomotives that could be built with minimal equipment, by publishing over 50 locomotive designs in various gauges, serialized mostly in Model Engineer magazine. Many other model engineers have contributed numerous designs notable for their enduring popularity. Prior to the appearance of Engineering in Miniature magazine in 1979 and Model Engineers' Workshop in 1990, these authors wrote almost exclusively in Model Engineer. Among these, Edgar T. Westbury produced many internal combustion engine designs, W.J. Hughes designed many agricultural and traction engine models. Colonel C. E. Bowden will be remembered as one of the most prolific experimenters with model aircraft, model boats and radio control, particularly his successes in powered model flight co-operating with E. T. Westbury, who made the Atom Minor engine that powered several of his early models. Martin Evans produced a great many more model locomotive designs, George H. Thomas specialised in designs for workshop accessories, Tubal Cain (T. D. Walshaw) developed a number of stationary engine designs, and Claude B. Reeve produced many clock designs. Ian Bradley and Norman Hallows wrote individually and together under the pen- name of Duplex on a wide range of topics, notably finely finished and ingenious tooling. Don Young contributed locomotive designs to Model Engineer and then published his own quarterly live steam magazine Locomotives Large and Small from 1979 until his death in 1994. More recently, Kozo Hiraoka has authored several series of logging locomotive articles in the U.S. magazine Live Steam. Among living model engineers Cherry Hill is notable for her small- scale working models of unusual early steam vehicles. Tools and equipment for model engineering A typical small metal-turning lathe, as used by model engineers. Machine tools used for model engineering include the lathe, the mill, the shaper, and the drill press. Until the introduction from Asia of relatively cheap machinery, beginning in the 1980s, UK or US made machine tools produced by Myford, South bend, Bridgeport and other now-defunct Western companies were fairly ubiquitous in model engineering. These days model engineers have a choice of new budget-made Asian machinery, the restoration of 'old iron' (used machinery made to high standards in the former Western industrial centres), or, if money is not an issue, new high-end machinery from the few remaining Western manufacturers. These machines only become truly useful once the model engineer accumulates a large set of associated tooling (such as drills, reamers, collets, etc.) that, all up, may cost more than the larger items of machinery. Model engineers often economise by making items of tooling themselves. Although traditionally a manual hobby, that is, one that relies on the model engineer hand-making the parts with the assistance of manually operated machinery, computerised tools are becoming popular with some model engineers. Designs are now often produced with the aid of CAD software. Some model engineers use 3D CAD software to build the model in virtual space before commencing on the physical model. Such CAD software also interfaces with CNC machinery, particularly milling machines, of which an increasing range is now aimed at model engineers and other 'home shop machinists', making it possible for some model components to be manufactured under computer control.. 3D printing is another emerging technology for model engineers to explore. Model engineering continues to expand by incorporating new technologies including laser cutting, 3D printing and embedded electronics establishing more and more common ground with the maker movement, these computerised pursuits are a sub-branch of model engineering and are not followed by the majority. Model engineering kits Kits of parts offer a shortcut to the traditional method of building. Kits fall into two categories, machined and unmachined kits. Unmachined kits usually consist of drawings, castings, stock metal, and possibly fasteners and other fixings necessary to complete the model. They require machining facilities to complete and often also require additional components and raw materials. Typically the minimum machine requirements are a lathe, drilling machine, and possibly a milling machine. A good level of knowledge about machining is necessary to successfully complete these kits. Machined kits are a set of parts that are fully machined and only require finishing with hand tools, painting, and assembly. Workshop machinery is not required. The kit will typically contain all the parts necessary to complete the model. These kits require a lot less work than an unmachined kit, but are very expensive and choice of subject matter is limited. Information sources for model engineering Examples of model engineering media: magazines, books and internet. There are many books, magazines and internet forums about model engineering. Magazines remain the main source of detailed designs and plans (in addition to carrying news items and discussion of products and techniques). These detailed designs and plans contain instructions and drawings sufficient to build a particular model. In the pages of magazine back-issues, hundreds of such designs exist for all sorts of models. Many of the plans are also reprinted by plans services and model engineering suppliers. Books tend to discuss techniques (sometimes with detailed designs and plans), and forums are active in problem-solving and general discussion. There are also many model engineers' websites or blogs that feature their owners' current and past projects. Some model engineering webzines also exist. Annual model engineering shows and exhibitions are held around the world, organized either by local and regional clubs or professional exhibition firms. The largest exhibitions are held in London, Doncaster (previously at Harrogate), and Bristol in the UK; York, Pennsylvania in the US; and Karlsruhe in Germany. The Miniature Engineering Craftsmanship Museum in Carlsbad, California (USA) has a permanent collection of exhibits.

Craig Venter Institute in Rockville, Maryland Educational Bus near J. Craig Venter Institute in Rockville, Maryland The J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) is a non-profit genomics research institute founded by J. Craig Venter, Ph.D. in October 2006. The Institute was the result of consolidating four organizations: the Center for the Advancement of Genomics, The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR), the Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives, and the J. Craig Venter Science Foundation Joint Technology Center. It has facilities in Rockville, Maryland and La Jolla, California. The Institute studies the societal implications of genomics in addition to genomics itself. The Institute's research involves genomic medicine; environmental genomic analysis; clean energy; synthetic biology; and ethics, law, and economics. The Institute employs over 200 people, including Nobel laureate Hamilton Smith.  History  In 2004, the Center for the Advancement of Genomics (TCAG), the Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives (IBEA) and the J. Craig Venter Institute Joint Technology Center (JTC) were merged and to form the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI). in 1992, Craig Venter was a researcher at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). He began The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) during the same time and was part of the determination of the human genome. Because of disagreements of how the project was being managed TIGR was excluded from the funding by NIH in 1998. The political, personal, and ethical conflicts of the race between the public and private sectors have been notable. In 1995, the precursor to the J. Craig Venter Institute, TIGR, determined the sequence of, Mycoplasma genitalium and Methanococcus jannaschii. In 1997, TIGR determined the genome of Borrelia burgdorferi (which causes Lyme Disease) . In 1998, TIGR sequenced the genome of Treponema pallidum (which causes syphilis). In 1999 TIGR published the sequence of the radioresistant polyextremophile Deinococcus radiodurans. TIGR has sequenced and analyzed more than 50 microbial genomes. TIGR developed the gene finder GLIMMER and the sequence alignment program MUMmer. In 2001 anthrax attacks, TIGR worked with the National Science Foundation and the FBI to sequence the strain of Bacillus anthracis used in bioterrorism attacks. In June 2000, Venter founded The Center for the Advancement of Genomics (TCAG), a think tank for studying the ethics of human genetics and stem cells research. Also in 2002, Venter founded the Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives (IBEA) to investigate the use of microorganisms to produce alternate fuels (such as hydrogen) and to sequester carbon dioxide. The IBEA began genomic sequencing of environmental microbial populations that might be used. To provide support for these facilities, Venter created the J. Craig Venter Institute Joint Technology Center (JTC), which specialized in high throughput sequencing. To provide administrative and financial support for TIGR, TCAG, IBEA and JTC, Venter created the non-profit J. Craig Venter Science Foundation (JCVSF) to consolidate activities between its affiliated organizations. In 2007, the Institute published the first diploid human genome, i.e. the genome of a single individual (J. Craig Venter) in which both sets of chromosomes were sequenced. In 2010, the Institute determined the 1.08 million base pair Mycoplasma mycoides genome, which was then inserted into a cell to create the first cell with a completely synthetic genome.

He became notorious for his exploitation of his tenants, with the word \\"Rachmanism\\" entering the Oxford English Dictionary as a synonym for the exploitation and intimidation of tenants. Early life and World War II Rachman was born in Lw√≥w, Poland, in 1919, the son of a Jewish dentist.Shirley Green Rachman, 1979, London: Michael Joseph, p. 7. After the German invasion of Poland in 1939, Rachman may have joined the Polish resistance.Green, Rachman, p. 9. He was first interned by the Germans and, after escaping across the Soviet border, was reinterned in a Soviet labour camp in Siberia and cruelly treated.Green, Rachman, pp. 10‚Äì12. After the Germans invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, Rachman and other Polish prisoners joined the II Polish Corps and fought with the Allies in the Middle East and Italy. After the war he stayed with his unit, as an occupation force in Italy until 1946 when it transferred to Britain. Rachman was demobilised in 1948 and became a British resident.Green, Rachman, pp. 12‚Äì19. Business career Rachman began his career by working for an estate agent in Shepherd's Bush. By 1957, he had built up a property empire in west London, consisting of more than a hundred run-down mansion blocks and several nightclubs. His office was at 91‚Äì93 Westbourne Grove, in Bayswater and the first house he purchased and used for multi-occupation was nearby in the run-down, St Stephen's Gardens, W2. In adjacent areas in Notting Hill (W11) and North Kensington (W10), including Powis Square, Powis Gardens, Powis Terrace, Colville Road and Colville Terrace, he also subdivided large properties into flats and let rooms, initially often for prostitution. Much of this area, south of Westbourne Park Road, having become derelict, was compulsorily purchased by Westminster City Council in the late 1960s and was demolished in 1973‚Äì74 to make way for the Wessex Gardens estate.British History Online ‚Äì Paddington & Westbourne GreenFlickr photo-set illustrating aftermath of Rachmanism in Westbourne Park area of London According to his biographer, Shirley Green, Rachman moved the protected tenants into a smaller concentration of properties or bought them out to minimise the number of tenancies with statutory rent controls. Houses were also subdivided into a number of flats to increase the number of tenancies without rent controls.Green, Rachman, pp. 56‚Äì69. Rachman filled the properties with recent migrants from the West Indies. Rachman's initial reputation, which he sought to promote in the media, was as someone who could help to find and provide accommodation for immigrants but he was massively overcharging these West Indian tenants, as they did not have the same protection under the law as had the previous tenants. By 1958, he had largely moved out of slum-landlordism into property development, but his former henchmen, including the equally notorious Michael de Freitas (aka Michael X/Abdul Malik), who created a reputation for himself as a black-power leader and Johnny Edgecombe, who became a promoter of jazz and blues music, helped to keep him in the limelight.Getting it Straight in Notting Hill Gate, Tom Vague, 2007 A special police unit was set up to investigate Rachman in 1959 and uncovered a complex network of 33 companies he had set up to control his property empire. They also discovered Rachman was involved in prostitution and he was prosecuted twice for brothel-keeping. At the time, he lived in Hampstead, and was using a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce. In 1960, after Ronnie Kray was imprisoned for 18 months for running a protection racket and related threats, his brother Reggie approached Rachman with a business proposition. Rachman would buy properties for the Krays and they would take a percentage from the rentals as \\"protection\\". Rachman realised this was a ruse by the Krays to slowly take over his property empire and made them a counter offer, to run a central London nightclub he owned. When the Krays agreed, they took over Esmeralda's Barn in Knightsbridge (now the location of the Berkeley Hotel). By giving the Krays a club, Rachman knew they had got what they wanted and they would leave him alone. Rachman did not achieve general notoriety until after his death, when the Profumo affair of 1963 hit the headlines and it emerged that both Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies had been his mistresses and that he had owned the mews house in Marylebone where Rice- Davies and Keeler had briefly stayed. As full details of his criminal activities were revealed, there was a call for new legislation to prevent such practices, led by Ben Parkin, MP for Paddington North, who coined the term \\"Rachmanism\\". The Rent Act 1965 gave security of tenure to tenants in privately rented properties. Personal life Rachman married his long- standing girlfriend Audrey O'Donnell in March 1960 but remained a compulsive womaniser, maintaining Mandy Rice-Davies as his mistress at 1 Bryanston Mews West, W1, where he had previously briefly installed Christine Keeler. After suffering two heart attacks, Peter Rachman died in Edgware General Hospital on 29 November 1962, at the age of 43. He is buried at the Bushey Jewish Cemetery in Bushey, Hertfordshire.Green, Rachman, pp. 232‚Äì33. Rachman was denied British citizenship. As his home city was transferred from Poland to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (part of the Soviet Union) in February 1946, he became stateless.Green (1979), Rachman.

It is a sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876), Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884), and Tom Sawyer Abroad (1894). Tom Sawyer attempts to solve a mysterious murder in this burlesque of the immensely popular detective novels of the time. Like Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, the story is told using the first-person narrative voice of Huck Finn. Film adaptations *In 1938, the novel was made into a film directed by Louis King, starring Billy Cook as Tom and Donald O'Connor as Huckleberry Finn. *A similar incarnation of Tom Sawyer appeared in the film version of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, set three years after the publication of this novel. In this film, Tom works for the United States Secret Service, and in the novelization of the film, Sawyer mentions that he once worked as a detective. Controversy In 1909, Danish schoolmaster Valdemar Thoresen claimed, in an article in the magazine Maaneds, that the plot of the book had been plagiarized from Steen Blicher's story The Vicar of Weilby. Blicher's work had been translated into German, but not into English, and Twain's secretary wrote Mr. Thoresen a letter, stating, \\"Mr. Clemens is not familiar with Danish and does not read German fluently, and has not read the book you mention, nor any translation or adaptation of it that he is aware of. The matter constituting 'Tom Sawyer, Detective,' is original with Mr. Clemens, who has never been consciously a plagiarist.\\" \\"Was 'Tom Sawyer' Danish Or American?; Why Mark Twain Is Charged with 'Borrowing' from Steen Blicher's Story of 'The Vicar of Weilby.'\\", by Henry S.

It is also widely known for the failed execution of Willie Francis, the first failed execution by electric chair. History The 1940 Louisiana legislature changed the method of execution, making execution by electrocution effective from June 1, 1941. Louisiana's electric chair did not have a permanent home at first, and was taken from parish to parish to perform the executions. The electrocution would usually be carried out in the courthouse or jail of the parish where the condemned inmate had been convicted. Eugene Johnson, a black man convicted of robbing and murdering Steven Bench, a white farmer who lived near Albany, was the first to die in Louisiana's electric chair; he was electrocuted in the Livingston Parish Jail on September 11, 1941. In 1957, it was decided to build an execution chamber at the Louisiana State Penitentiary to carry out all executions in Louisiana. Notable executions in the chair were those of Elmo Patrick Sonnier (the inmate on whom the film Dead Man Walking was based) and Willie Francis (the only inmate to survive the electric chair; he was ultimately executed after the first attempt failed). Following new legislation enacted in 1991, the State of Louisiana opted for the use of lethal injection as the sole method of execution. The last person executed on \\"Gruesome Gertie\\" was Andrew Lee Jones, on July 22, 1991. During its fifty years, \\"Gruesome Gertie\\" was used for a total of eighty-seven executions. It now sits at the Louisiana Prison Museum in Angola, Louisiana. Botched execution \\"Gruesome Gertie\\" is also infamous for having the first known incident of a failed execution by electrocution in the United States. During the execution of Willie Francis on May 3, 1946, the electric chair had been improperly set up by a drunken prison guard, causing Francis to scream \\"Take it off! Take it off! Let me breathe!\\" from behind his leather hood. The execution was aborted, and an appeal was filed to the Supreme Court, which was denied. Francis was later successfully executed on May 9, 1947. Cultural references * \\"Gruesome Gertie\\" appeared in the film Monster's Ball for the execution sequence. These scenes with the chair were filmed in the actual execution chamber at Louisiana State Penitentiary, where \\"Gruesome Gertie\\" had been used for real executions a decade earlier. * \\"Gruesome Gertie\\" is the instrument of death in Ernest J. Gaines's novel A Lesson Before Dying. It's used to execute the young black man Jefferson, for a murder he didn't commit.

Its Naval equivalent is master seaman (MS) (French: matelot-chef or matc). It is also known as the most senior corporal rank in the Indonesian Military ranks, which is known as Kopral Kepala. According to the Queen's Regulations and Orders: > (1) The Chief of the Defence Staff or such officer as he may designate may > appoint a corporal as a master corporal. > (2) The rank of a master corporal remains that of corporal. > (3) Master corporals have seniority among themselves in their order of > seniority as corporals. > (4) Master corporals have authority and powers of command over all other > corporals.\\" -- QR&O; 3.08 Master corporal, while formally an appointment, is treated as a de facto non- commissioned member rank, and is often described as such, even in official documents. As mentioned above, the master corporal is senior to the corporal (and its Naval counterpart, leading seaman). It is junior to the rank of sergeant (Sgt) and its equivalent naval rank, petty officer 2nd class (PO2). Master corporals and master seamen together with corporals and leading seamen make up the cadre of junior non-commissioned officers. Master Corporal thumbThe rank insignia of a master corporal is a 2-bar chevron, worn point down, surmounted by a maple leaf. Embroidered rank badges are worn in \\"CF gold\\" thread on rifle green (Army) melton, or in silver on Air Force blue (Air Force) melton, stitched to the upper sleeves of the Service Dress jacket; as miniature gold metal and rifle-green enamel badges on the collars of the Army dress shirt and Army outerwear jackets; in \\"old-gold\\" thread on Air Force blue slip-ons on Air Force shirts, sweaters, and coats; and in tan (Army) or dark blue (Air Force) thread on CADPAT slip-ons on the Operational Dress uniform. Insignia for mess kit is determined by branch or regimental tradition. Master corporals normally mess and billet with the Junior Ranks. Within most Canadian Army units, master corporals are commonly nicknamed \\"master jack\\" or \\"jack\\" by both superiors and subordinates. The nickname is derived from the former equivalent rank of Lance Corporal, or \\"Lance Jack\\". This is an informality and is only used within social context and never in formal proceedings. Only in closer working or socially comfortable units like rifle regiments or infantry units in general is this informal term commonly used. Master corporals are also frequently referred to as \\"chef\\" in Quebec, a reference to the French translation of the rank, caporal-chef; which has also caused the term \\"Chief\\" to be used by Quebec Anglophone military members. History The Master Corporal appointment came into existence after the unification of the Canadian Forces in the mid 60s. A power vacuum was inadvertently created when private soldiers were promoted to the rank of corporal as an incentive for continuing in the Forces at a time when Unification was introduced by Defence Minister Hellyer, who promoted all privates with requisite time in service to what was originally a leadership rank (corporal) in the Army. Eventually, corporals who had passed the \\"B\\" phase of their leadership training took to wearing a crown over their chevrons, and this arrangement was eventually formalized by having a maple leaf replace the crown, and the new \\"'B' Corporals\\", as they were known, became Master Corporals. Responsibilities The rank, formally an appointment as a senior corporal, gives the MCpl authority over all privates and corporals. As such, a MCpl is a first level supervisor who will be assessed on his/her ability to manage and develop subordinates. Given the structure of the Canadian infantry platoon, the MCpl is roughly equivalent to the British rank of Lance Corporal, second in command of an infantry section. However, due to the fact that MCpls often command sections and occupy various NCO position, as well as the fact that trained leadership is retained at a lower level (section) than in other militaries, it is more realistic to equivocate MCpls with the British, Australian and New Zealand rank of Corporal. In Indonesia The Master Corporal rank insignia of the Indonesian Army In the Indonesian Military, the rank \\"Master Corporal\\" is known as Kopral Kepala (Kopka). In Indonesia, \\"Corporal\\" has three levels, which are: Second Corporal (Lance Corporal), First Corporal (Corporal), and Master Corporal. Requirements The general requirements for promotion to Master Corporal include a Qualification Level 5 course (known as a Journeyman course in some trades), a primary leadership qualification course (PLQ), and a time in the rank of Corporal for a minimum of two years. However, certain trades have their own particular qualifications in addition to the above. For example, infantry combines the Qualification Level 5B course, Qualification Level 6A, and Junior Leader's course in a single Infantry Section Commander's Course. In addition, in order to be promoted to Master Corporal an infantry soldier must have successfully completed a machine gunner's specialization course. Master Corporals often serve as Training Non-Commissioned Officers for the purposes of training new soldiers. They are often a new recruit's first taste of military life.

Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Bob Clampett. The cartoon features Bugs Bunny. Plot This cartoon opens with the title credits over the strains of ‚ÄúDown by the Riverside‚Äù, then into an extended series of establishing shots of an Army Air Force base, to the brassy strains of ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in to Win‚Äù (a World War II song also sung by Daffy Duck in Scrap Happy Daffy two months before). The sign at the base reads \\"U.S. Army Air Field\\", and below that is shown the location, the number of planes (which include C-45 Expeditors and a Douglas B-18 Bolo) and number of men, all marked \\"Censored\\" as a reference to military secrecy. Beneath those categories, the sign reads \\"What men think of top sergeant\\", which is shown with a large white-on-black \\"CENSORED!!\\", as the language implied would not pass scrutiny by the Hays Office. Bugs is found reclining on a piece of ordnance next to a bomber plane, idly reading Victory Thru Hare Power (a spoof of the 1942 book).Shull, Wilt (2004), p. 61 Bugs Bunny, leaning on a blockbuster bomb, is seen laughing uproariously; he turns to the audience and shares what he is reading: an accusation that gremlins wreck American planes through \\"di-a-bo- lick-al saa-boh-tay-jee,\\" a notion that Bugs finds ludicrous. A little yellow humanoid with airplane wings on a large blue helmet scuttles by and begins striking the bomb with a mallet, whistling \\"I've Been Working on the Railroad.\\" Noticing the creature's lack of success, Bugs offers to take a shot at the bomb and takes a long hard swing, stopping immediately before making contact in sudden realization that he had nearly been hoodwinked. He then ponders if the creature in question were a gremlin, and the gremlin affirms with a shout: \\"It ain't Vendell Villkie!\\" The gremlin knocks Bugs out with a monkey wrench, and when the gremlin revives him, Bugs speaks nonsensically as Lennie Small, then Baby Snooks. Quickly regaining consciousness, a now infuriated Bugs gives chase, repeatedly getting slighted by the amused gremlin, which includes repeated strikes with a monkey wrench and laughing to the tune of \\"Yankee Doodle.\\" Upon chasing the gremlin inside a bomber (which ironically resembles a Heinkel He-111), Bugs finds himself locked from the outside, and then the gremlin takes the plane to the air, unbeknownst to Bugs. Bugs manages to burst out of the exit door and narrowly escapes plunging to his death when he realizes the plane is airborne (realizing he has made himself a jackass as the Private Snafu theme plays). He manages to get back in, in the process showing a heretofore-unseen ability to fly like a bird, only to slide right out the other door due to strategically placed banana skins; when the gremlin opens the door again, he finds a terrified Bugs clinging to it with his heart pounding \\"4F\\" (Army code for drastically limiting medical condition, hospitalization required, and/or ineligible to be inducted via the draft). By this point, the gremlin is flying the plane through a city with two large skyscrapers. Bugs rushes into the cockpit, takes control of the airplane, rolls it vertically, and flies through an extremely narrow slot between the towers to avoid what seemed to be an inevitable impact. The plane goes into a steep nosedive, its wings ripping off during its descent, with only the fuselage remaining, making Bugs both airsick and terrified. The gremlin nonchalantly awaits the plane's crash while playing with a yo-yo. The plane then unexpectedly sputters to a halt, half a short distance above the ground and hanging in mid-air, defying gravity. Both Bugs and the Gremlin then casually address the audience: the gremlin apologizes for the plane's fuel depletion, while Bugs points to a wartime gas rationing sticker on the plane's windshield and remarks: \\"Yeah. You know how it is with these A cards!\\"(An 'A card' was the lowest priority, entitling 3‚Äì4 gallons of gasoline per week)  Availability  Falling Hare is available on Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 3 and Looney Tunes Platinum Collection: Volume 3. Voice cast * Mel Blanc as Bugs Bunny and The Gremlin * Bob Clampett as Vocal effects Production notes Falling Hare went into production under the title Bugs Bunny and the Gremlin. Walt Disney was developing a feature based on Roald Dahl‚Äôs novel The Gremlins, and asked other animation studios not to produce any films involving gremlins. However, Warner Bros. was too far into production on this cartoon and Russian Rhapsody to remove the references to gremlins, so Leon Schlesinger merely re-titled the cartoons as a compromise. This is one of the few Bugs Bunny cartoons to have fallen into the public domain, as in 1967, United Artists, the copyright holder for most of the pre-1950's Warner Bros. cartoons at the time, failed to renew the copyright in time. Release and reception Because of the cartoon‚Äôs public domain status, it can be found on budget compilations in lower quality prints, while Warner Home Video issued a restored print on Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 3 and Looney Tunes Platinum Collection: Volume 3, with optional audio commentary by John Kricfalusi and Bill Melendez (Melendez was one of the animators on the cartoon). In 1989, it was included in the MGM/UA Home Video release Bugs & Daffy: The Wartime Cartoons. When the Southern Television broadcast interruption occurred in the United Kingdom, the interruption ended shortly before the start of this cartoon. Elements from the short have been used in other Warner Bros. works. * Footage of this cartoon's climax was incorporated as a flashback into a later Bugs Bunny cartoon, His Hare-Raising Tale (1951). Bugs, narrating to his nephew Clyde, describes himself as a World War II test pilot who narrowly escaped death in a near-crash (fortunately, as in Falling Hare, he ran out of gas). There is no mention of the Gremlin character, and one of Bugs' screams (\\"Yow-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo!!\\") from earlier in the cartoon is inserted into the soundtrack. The scene fades out as it zooms in on the stalled aircraft suspended inches above the ground. * Black-and-white footage from the cartoon was featured in the second trailer for Gremlins 2: The New Batch (directed by Joe Dante). Though no footage was used in the theatrical cut of the film, a clip from the cartoon appeared in the VHS version. * The Gremlin nemesis makes two reappearances in Tiny Toon Adventures. In \\"Journey to the Center of Acme Acres\\", the Gremlin appears (with several look-alikes) as the cause of earthquakes in Acme Acres after their gold is stolen by Montana Max. Clampett is given an acknowledgement in the credits for their design. In the special Night Ghoulery, a singular Gremlin antagonizes Plucky Duck in the segment titled \\"Gremlin on a Wing\\" (a spoof of the Twilight Zone episode \\"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\\"). * It also made a brief cameo in \\"Plane Pals\\" (an episode from Animaniacs) as a passenger. * The scene in which a flattened Bugs mutters \\"I‚Äôm only 3¬Ω years old\\" and rolls on the floor flat as a pancake is used in \\"Who Bopped Bugs Bunny?\\" (an episode from Tiny Toon Adventures). * The ending \\"out of gas\\" gag is referenced in the 2003 theatrical release Looney Tunes Back in Action. Bugs and the live-action characters in the airplane are suspended above the ground until one character comments on the situation's lack of realism, prompting the plane to fall the remaining few feet. This cartoon had a scene where a 2-engine USAAF bomber was flown directly at a skyscraper in what looked to be a certain impact. Two years after its release, a USAAF B-25 Mitchell bomber was inadvertently flown into the Empire State Building on a foggy day, and 56 years after that, the September 11 attacks occurred on a sunny day.

It is a section of the larger South Coast of Western Australia and neighbouring agricultural regions. The region officially comprises the local government areas of Albany, Broomehill-Tambellup, Cranbrook, Denmark, Gnowangerup, Jerramungup, Katanning, Kent, Kojonup, Plantagenet and Woodanilling. The Great Southern Region has an area of and a population of about 54,000. Its administrative centre is the historic port of Albany. It has a Mediterranean climate, with hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. and http://www.bom.gov.au/wa/albany/ The Stirling Range, is the only place in Western Australia that regularly receives snowfalls, if only very light. The economy of the Great Southern Region is dominated by livestock farming, dairy farming and crop-growing. It has some of the most productive cereal grain and pastoral land in the state, and is a major producer of wool and lamb. Albany is a major fishing centre. The coast of the Great Southern Region has milder summer weather than areas on the west coast proper and is also a popular destination for holidaymakers, tourists, anglers and surfers. Albany is home to the Kalgan River which is associated with riverboats, from 1918 to 1935 with the Silver Star which lowered its funnel to get under a bridge, and today with the Kalgan Queen which lowers its roof to pass beneath the same bridge. Bremer Bay. Fishing, tourism and leisure are significant industries in the Great Southern Region. Noongar people have inhabited the region for tens of thousands of years. European settlement began with the establishment of a temporary British military base, commanded by Major Edmund Lockyer, at King George Sound (Albany) on Christmas Day, 1826. Albany is consequently regarded as the oldest European settlement in Western Australia.

He introduced the use of complex systems and generative models in developmental biology. He suggested that a reductionist view of nature fails to explain complex features, controversially proposing the structuralist theory that morphogenetic fields might substitute for natural selection in driving evolution.Dickinson, W. Joseph. (1998). Form and Transformation: Generative and Relational Principles in Biology. by Gerry Webster; Brian Goodwin. The Quarterly Review of Biology. Vol. 73, No. 1. pp. 62-63. He was also a visible member of the Third Culture movement.Brian Goodwin obituary - The Guardian, 9 August 2009 Biography Brian Goodwin was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 1931. He studied biology at McGill University and then emigrated to the UK, under a Rhodes Scholarship for studying mathematics at Oxford. He got his PhD at the University of Edinburgh under the supervision of Conrad Hal Waddington. He then moved to Sussex University until 1983 when he became a full professor at the Open University in Milton Keynes until retirement in 1992. He became a major figure in the early development of mathematical biology, along with other researchers. He was one of the attendants to the famous meetings that took place between 1965 and 1968 in Villa Serbelloni, hosted by the Rockefeller Foundation, under the topic \\"Towards a theoretical Biology\\". The workshop involved, among other key scientists, Conrad Waddington, Jack Cowan, Michael Conrad, Jim Burns, Christopher Zeeman, Richard Lewontin, Robert Rosen, Stuart Kauffman, John Maynard Smith, Ren√© Thom and Lewis Wolpert. As a result of the conference talks and discussions, a four-volume proceedings of the event came out, becoming at the time a major reference in the area. Thereafter, he taught at the Schumacher College in Devon, UK, where he was instrumental in starting the college's MSc in Holistic Science. He was made a Founding Fellow of Schumacher College shortly before his death. Goodwin also had a research position at MIT and was a long time visitor of several institutions including the UNAM in Mexico City. He was a founding member of the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico where he also served as a member of the science board for several years.Brian Goodwin , SteinerBooksBrian Goodwin Obituary - The Independent, 31 July 2009. Brian Goodwin died in hospital in 2009, after surgery resulting from a fall from his bicycle.Professor Brian Goodwin , Schumacher College Goodwin is survived by his third wife, Christel, and his daughter, Lynn. Gene networks and development Shortly after Fran√ßois Jacob and Jacques Monod developed their first model of gene regulation, Goodwin proposed the first model of a genetic oscillator, showing that regulatory interactions among genes allowed periodic fluctuations to occur. Shortly after this model became published, he also formulated a general theory of complex gene regulatory networks using statistical mechanics. In its simplest form, Goodwin's oscillator involves a single gene that represses itself. Goodwin equations were originally formulated in terms of conservative (Hamiltonian) systems, thus not taking into account dissipative effects that are required in a realistic approach to regulatory phenomena in biology. Many versions have been developed since then. The simplest (but realistic) formulation considers three variables, X, Y and Z indicating the concentrations of RNA, protein and end product which generates the negative feedback loop. The equations are : \\\\frac{dX}{dt}= {k_1 \\\\over K_1 + Z^n}-k_2X : \\\\frac{dY}{dt}= k_3 X - k_4 Y : \\\\frac{dZ}{dt}= k_5 Y - k_6 Z and closed oscillations can occur for n>8 and behave limit cycles: after a perturbation of the system's state, it returns to its previous attractor. A simple modification of this model, adding other terms introducing additional steps in the transcription machinery allows to find oscillations for smaller n values. Goodwin's model and its extensions have been widely used over the years as the basic skeleton for other models of oscillatory behavior, including circadian clocks, cell division or physiological control systems. Developmental biology In the field of developmental biology, Goodwin explored self- organization in pattern formation, using case studies from single-cell (as Acetabularia) to multicellular organisms, including early development in Drosophila. He proposed that morphogenetic fields, defined in terms of spatial distributions of chemical signals (morphogenes), could pattern and shape the embryo. In this way, geometry and development were linked through a mathematical formalism. Along with his colleague Lynn Trainor, Goodwin developed a set of mathematical equations describing the changes of both physical boundaries in the organism and chemical gradients. By considering the mechanochemical behaviour of the cortical cytoplasm (or cytogel) of plant cells, a viscoelastic material mainly composed of actin microfilaments and reinforced by a microtubules network, Goodwin & Trainor (1985) showed how to couple calcium and the mechanical properties of the cytoplasm. The cytogel is treated as a continuous viscoelastic medium in which calcium ions can diffuse and interact with the cytoskeleton. The model consists in two non-linear partial differential equations which describe the evolution of the mechanical strain field and of the calcium distribution in the cytogel. It has been shown (Trainor & Goodwin, 1986) that, in a range of parameter values, instabilities may occur and develop in this system, leading to intracellular patterns of strain and calcium concentration. The equations read, in their general form: : \\\\rho {\\\\partial^2 \\\\xi \\\\over \\\\partial t^2} = {\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial x} \\\\left ( P_1(\\\\chi){\\\\partial \\\\xi \\\\over \\\\partial x} \\\\right ) + {\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial x} \\\\left ( P_2(\\\\chi){\\\\partial^2 \\\\xi \\\\over \\\\partial x \\\\partial t} \\\\right ) - P_3(\\\\chi) - F_0 {\\\\partial \\\\chi \\\\over \\\\partial x} : {\\\\partial \\\\chi \\\\over \\\\partial t} = \\\\left ( a_0 + a {\\\\partial \\\\xi \\\\over \\\\partial x} \\\\right ) (K-\\\\chi) - k_1(\\\\beta+\\\\chi)\\\\chi^n + D {\\\\partial^2 \\\\xi \\\\over \\\\partial x^2} These equations describe the spatiotemporal dynamics of the displacement from the reference state and the calcium concentration, respectively. Here x and t are the space and time coordinates, respectively. These equations can be applied to many different scenarios and the different functions P(x) introduce the specific mechanical properties of the medium. These equations can generate a rich variety of static and dynamic patterns, from complex geometrical motifs to oscillations and chaos (Briere 1994)[reference needed]. Structuralism He was also a strong advocate of the view that genes cannot fully explain the complexity of biological systems. In that sense, he became one of the strongest defenders of the systems view against reductionism. He suggested that nonlinear phenomena and the fundamental laws defining their behavior were essential to understand biology and its evolutionary paths. His position within evolutionary biology can be defined as a structuralist one. To Goodwin, many patterns in nature are a byproduct of constraints imposed by complexity. The limited repertoire of motifs observed in the spatial organization of plants and animals (at some scales) would be, in Goodwin's opinion, a fingerprint of the role played by such constraints. The role of natural selection would be secondary. These opinions were highly controversial, and they brought Goodwin into conflict with many prominent Darwinian evolutionists, whereas some physicists found some of his views natural. Physicist Murray Gell-Mann for example acknowledged that \\"when biological evolution ‚Äî based on largely random variation in genetic material and on natural selection ‚Äî operates on the structure of actual organisms, it does so subject to the laws of physical science, which place crucial limitations on how living things can be constructed.\\" Richard Dawkins, the former professor for public understanding of science at Oxford University and a well known Darwinian evolutionist, conceded: \\"I don't think there's much good evidence to support [his thesis], but it's important that somebody like Brian Goodwin is saying that kind of thing, because it provides the other extreme, and the truth probably lies somewhere between.\\" Dawkins also agreed that \\"It's a genuinely interesting possibility that the underlying laws of morphology allow only a certain limited range of shapes.\\". For his part, Goodwin did not reject basic Darwinism, only its excesses. Reception Biologist Gert Korthof has praised the research of Goodwin commenting he tried to \\"improve Darwinism in a scientific way.\\"\\"How the Leopard Changed Its Spots\\". Retrieved 2014-04-25. David B. Wake has also positively reviewed Goodwin's research describing him as a \\"thoughtful scientist, one of the great dissenters from the orthodoxies of modern evolutionary, genetic and developmental biology\\".Wake, David B. (1996). How the Leopard Changed Its Spots: The Evolution of Complexity by Brian Goodwin. American Scientist. Vol. 84, No. 3. pp. 300-301. Goodwin had argued that natural selection was \\"too weak [a] force\\" to explain evolution and only operated as a filter mechanism. He claimed that modern evolutionary biology failed to provide an explanation for the theory of biological form and had ignored the importance of morphogenesis in evolution. He claimed to provide a new evolutionary theory to replace neo-Darwinism. In a critical review, biologist Catherine S. C. Price noted that although he had succeeded in providing an alternative to mutation as the only source of variation, he failed to provide an alternative to natural selection as a mechanism of adaptation.Price, Catherine S. C. (1995). Structurally Unsound. Evolution. Vol. 49, No. 6. pp. 1298-1302. Price claimed Goodwin's \\"discussion of evolution is biased, insufficiently developed and poorly informed\\", and that he misrepresented Darwinism, used straw man arguments and ignored research from population genetics.

The Greek name means \\"tiny penis\\".  Hosts  They are parasitic on a variety of molluscs, crustaceans, birds, and mammals, some species having complex life cycles involving more than one host. For example, Microphallus piriformes parasitizes the rough periwinkle (Littorina saxatilis); when these are eaten by herring gulls it infects the bird and lays its eggs in the bird's feces to infect new periwinkles. Other intermediate hosts include, for example New Zealand mud snail Potamopyrgus antipodarumLevri E. P. & Fisher L. M.

Parasite-host interactions  Several species are notable for manipulating or influencing their hosts. Microphallus piriformes causes its host, the rough periwinkle, to move upwards, making it more vulnerable to predation by herring gulls. Microphallus pseudopygmaeus chemically castrates (parasitic castration) its host, the snail Onoba aculeus, and causes it to grow larger than normal (it is not clear if this gigantism benefits the host or parasite or if it is a non- adaptive side-effect).Gorbushin A.

Some species of this genus \\"hitch-hike\\" on the manipulations of other species; for example, Microphallus hoffmanni parasitizes the same sand shrimps as Microphallus papillorobustus but does not manipulate the shrimps itself, instead benefiting from the latter's manipulation of the host.  Life cycle  Microphallus sp. is a widespread and locally common undescribed parasite in New Zealand lakes and streams. Multilocus allozyme genotype data show that Microphallus is a single outbred species with high levels of gene flow among South Island populations. The parasite exclusively uses Potamopyrgus antipodarum as the intermediate host, and the final hosts are waterfowl. Embryonated Microphallus eggs are ingested from sediment and hatch in the snail's gut, penetrate the intestine, and migrate to the gonads and digestive gland. Following successful establishment, the parasite then undergoes asexual reproduction, replacing much of the host's reproductive tissue and digestive gland, which results in complete sterilization of the snail. The first visible parasite developmental stages (blastocercariae) are detectable after approximately 75 days post- exposure and metacercariae are common by 90 days post-exposure at 16 ¬∞C in the lab. The life cycle is completed when snails containing metacercariae are consumed by waterfowl. References The article incorporates CC-BY-2.0 text from reference.Osnas E. E. & Lively C. M.

Roof and tunnel hacking is the unauthorized exploration of roof and utility tunnel spaces. The term carries a strong collegiate connotation, stemming from its use at MIT, where the practice has a long history. It is a form of urban exploration. Some participants use it as a means of carrying out collegiate pranks, by hanging banners from high places or, in one notable example from MIT, placing a life- size model police car on top of a university building. Others are interested in exploring inaccessible and seldom-seen places; that such exploration is unauthorized is often part of the thrill. Roofers, in particular, may be interested in the skyline views from the highest points on a campus. On August 1, 2016, Red Bull TV launched the documentary series URBEX ‚Äì Enter At Your Own Risk, that also chronicles roof and tunnel hacking. Vadding Vadding is a verb which has become synonymous with urban exploration. The word comes from MIT where, for a time in the late 1970s, some of the student population was addicted to a computer game called ADVENT (also known as Colossal Cave Adventure). In an attempt to hide the game from system administrators who would delete it if found, the game file was renamed ADV. As the system administrators became aware of this, the filename was changed again, this time to the permutation VAD. The verb vad appeared, meaning to play the game. Likewise, vadders were people who spent a lot of time playing the game. Thus, vadding and vadders began to refer to people who undertook actions in real life similar to those in the game. Since ADVENT was all about exploring tunnels, the MIT sport of roof and tunnel hacking became known as vadding. Today, the word vadding is rarely used at MIT (usually only by old-timers) and roof and tunnel hacking has returned as the preferred descriptive term. Those who participate in it generally refer to it simply as \\"hacking\\". Roof hacking Many buildings at American universities have flat roofs, whereas pitched roofs designed to shed snow or heavy rain present safety challenges for roof hackers. Entry points, such as trapdoors, exterior ladders, and elevators to penthouses that open onto roofs, are usually tightly secured. Roofers bypass locks (by lock picking or other methods), or use unsecured entry points to gain access to roofs. Once there, explorers may take photographs or enjoy the view; pranksters may hang banners or execute other sorts of mischief. Tunnel hacking Some universities have utility tunnels to carry steam heat and other utilities. Utility tunnels are usually designed for infrequent access for maintenance and the installation of new utilities, so they tend to be small and often cramped. Sometimes, utilities are routed through much larger pedestrian access tunnels (MIT has a number of such tunnels, reducing the need for large networks of steam tunnels; for this reason, there is only one traditional steam tunnel at MIT, built before many buildings were connected). Tunnels range from cold, damp, and muddy to unbearably hot (especially during cold weather). Some are large enough to allow a person to walk freely; others are low-ceilinged, forcing explorers to stoop, bend their knees, or even crawl. Even large tunnels may have points where crisscrossing pipes force an explorer to crawl under or climb over a pipe ‚Äî a highly dangerous activity, especially when the pipe contains scalding high-pressure steam (and may not be particularly well insulated, or may have weakened over the years since installation). Tunnels also tend to be loud. Background noise may prevent an explorer from hearing another person in the tunnel ‚Äî who might be a fellow explorer, a police officer, or a homeless person sheltering there. Tunnels may be well lit or pitch-dark, and the same tunnel may have sections of both. A utility tunnel photographed tunnel hacking at a university in Toronto, Canada Tunnel access points tend to be in locked mechanical rooms where steam pipes and other utilities enter a building, and through manholes. As with roofs, explorers bypass locks to enter mechanical rooms and the connected tunnels. Some adventurers may open manholes from above with crowbars or specialized manhole-opening hooks. Shafting Buildings may have maintenance shafts for passage of pipes and ducts between floors. Climbing these shafts is known as shafting. The practice is similar to buildering, which is done on the outsides of buildings. Regular use of a shaft can wear down insulation and cause other problems. To fix these problems, hackers sometimes take special trips into the shafts to correct any problems with duct tape or other equipment. A dangerous variant of shafting involves entering elevator shafts, either to ride on the top of the elevators, or to explore the shaft itself. This activity is sometimes called elevator surfing. The elevator is first switched to \\"manual\\" mode, before boarding or exiting, and back to \\"automatic\\" mode after, to allow normal operation (and avoid detection). Switching elevators, getting too near the ceiling (or under the elevator) or the counterweight (or cables), or otherwise failing to follow safety precautions can lead to death or injury. Crackdowns may increase in both frequency and harshness, both legally and with respect to physical access to coveted locations. Some shafts (such as those intended for but lacking an elevator) are accessible by use of rope but are not actually climbable by themselves. Dangers =Legal dangers= Universities generally prohibit roof and tunnel hacking, either by explicit policies or blanket rules against entry into non-public utility spaces. The reasoning behind these policies generally stems from concern for university infrastructure and concern for students. Consequences vary from university to university; those caught may be warned, fined, officially reprimanded, suspended, or expelled. Depending on the circumstances, tunnelers and roofers may be charged with trespassing, breaking and entering, or other criminal charges. MIT, once a vanguard of roof and tunnel hacking (books have been published on hacks and hacking at MIT), has been cracking down on the activity. In October 2006, three students were caught hacking near a crawl space in the MIT Faculty Club, arrested by the MIT police, and later charged with trespassing, breaking and entering with the intent to commit a felony. The charges raised an outcry among students and alumni who believed that MIT ought to have continued its history of handling hacking-related incidents internally. Charges against those students were eventually dropped. In June 2008, another graduate student was arrested and faced charges of breaking and entering with intent to commit a felony and possession of burglarious instruments after being caught after-hours in a caged room in a research building's basement. =Risks to building infrastructure= Utility tunnels carry everything from drinking water to power to fiber-optic network cabling. Some roofs have high power radio broadcast or radio reception equipment and weather-surveillance equipment, damage to which can be costly. Roofs and tunnels also may contain switches, valves, and controls for utility systems that were not designed to be accessible to the general public. Due to security concerns there has been a trend towards installing intrusion alarms to protect particularly hazardous or high-value equipment. =Personal hazards= Roofs are dangerous; aside from the obvious risk of toppling over the edge (especially at night, in inclement weather, or after drinking) students could be injured by high-voltage cabling or by microwave radiation from roof-mounted equipment.Occupational Safety and Health Administration In addition, laboratory buildings often vent hazardous gasses through exhaust stacks on the roof. Tunnels can be extremely dangerous ‚Äî superheated steam pipes are not always completely insulated; when they are insulated, it is occasionally with carcinogenic materials like asbestos. Opening or damaging a steam valve or pipe can be potentially deadly. Steam contains significantly more thermal energy than boiling water, and transfers that energy when it condenses on solid objects such as skin. It is typically provided under high pressure, meaning that comparatively minor pipe damage can fill a tunnel with steam quickly. In 2008, a high-pressure steam pipe exploded in the subbasement of Building 66 at MIT, apparently due to a construction defect. The explosion and ensuing flood caused extensive damage and lethal conditions in the subbasement. Confined spaces contain a range of hazards ‚Äî from toxic gases like hydrogen sulfide and carbon monoxide, to structures that may flood or entrap an adventurer. An explorer who enters a tunnel via a lock bypass method or via an inadvertently-left-open door may find themself trapped if the door locks behind them ‚Äî quite possibly in an area with no cell phone reception, and no one within earshot.

It prevents the surfboard from being swept away by waves and stops runaway surfboards from hitting other surfers and swimmers. Modern leashes consist of a urethane cord where one end has a band with a velcro strap attached to the surfer's trailing foot, and the opposite has a velcro strap attached to the tail end of the surfboard. Should the surfer fall while riding a wave, the surfboard will not be swept away, thus allowing the surfer to quickly recover his surfboard and return to the take- off zone. Background leash in use The leash was invented in the 1970s amidst controversy that it was a dangerous accessory. Prior to leashes introduction in 1971, surfers who fell off their boards had to swim to retrieve them with runaway boards being an inconvenience to the surfer and a danger to other surfers. Initially, people expressed concern that if a surfer fell while riding a wave and wearing a leg rope, the surfboard may bounce back and hit the surfer causing serious injury. Although this can happen, most surfers today choose to use a leg rope while surfing as it is believed that leg ropes prevent more accidents than they cause. Santa Cruz resident Pat O'Neill (son of surfer Jack O'Neill, inventor of the O'Neill Wetsuit) is credited with inventing the surf leash. His initial designs consisted of surgical cord attached to a board with a suction cup. At the 1971 Malibu international surfing competition, Pat offered leashes to his competitors in the event. Consequently he was disqualified from the event for wearing his leash, dubbed a kook cord by those at the event however over the next year, the leash became a ubiquitous tool in the surfing world. Pat's father, Jack O'Neill, lost his left eye in a surf leash accident as the surgical tubing used in the early designs allowed the leash to overstretch, causing the surfboard to fly back towards the surfer. Subsequent cords were made with less elastic materials such as bungee cords. The first leg rope on the surfboard was created by Peter Wright, in Raglan, New Zealand. It was established in the very early 1970s. It consisted of [nylon]. He is not credited for his efforts because he did not copyright the leg rope. The urethane design was patented by David Hattrick . Later in the 1970s, he established Pipe Lines surfing products and developed a design that could be patented. This design also won an Australian Design Award in 1979. Structure cuff Modern leg rope consists of four parts cuff, swivel, cord and rail saver. The cuff comes with a double wrap-around velcro cuff. The swivel allows the cuff to spin and twist without the rope itself twisting or tangling providing less strain on the rope. The cords are typically made from a high-quality polyurethane and typically come in 2 thicknesses. However, the thicker leg ropes has more drag in the water. The rails saver is designed to provide a secured connection to the board and protect the rail when a surfer falls. A leash cup, also known as a \\"leash plug\\", is an indentation in the deck of the board close to the tail that contains a small metal bar that a short cord can be girth hitched to for attaching a leash. Current use Leashes are still the source of some contention in surfing today as, although they are now accepted as mandatory equipment for shortboarders, many longboarders refuse to wear them, claiming it infereres with their ability to walk up and down the board. At crowded surf spots with large waves, it is argued that the freedom not wearing a leash gives is secondary to the safety of others.

History Blackwells Mills is on the east side of the Millstone River in Franklin Township, Somerset County, New Jersey. A mill was built in 1746 by Peter Schenk. His daughter married a Mercer and the mill passed to her family. The mill was purchased by William Blackwell in 1804 with his uncle Capt. Jacob Blackwell. These men were from nearby Hopewell Township. William Blackwell built a fine Federal period house on the land across the road on the Hillsborough side. Following Hurricane Floyd, the house was moved westward to higher ground. It is still standing. Following the death of William Blackwell in the 1850s, his son John came into possession of the mill. John Blackwell died early in life, and his widow sold the mill to Augustus VanZant in 1872. On May 31, 1771 the west bank of the Millstone River became Hillsborough Township, Somerset County, New Jersey. The mill burned down in 1885 and was rebuilt. A major restoration was done in 1943. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, Blackwells Mills had a total area of 1.296 square miles (3.356 km2), including 1.222 square miles (3.165 km2) of land and 0.074 square miles (0.191 km2) of water (5.70%).

According to his autobiography, he was born Aristide Pressman in Beaulieu-sur-Dordogne in France, where his father, a Polish electrical engineer, had found work laying down power lines. He was given the name Aristide at birth, because the name his parents wanted, Asher, the name of his maternal grandfather, was not on the list of permissible French given names. When he went to live in Israel, he changed his first name to Asher and, as was common among immigrants, changed his family name to the Hebrew Peres, which he used for the rest of his life. Peres obtained his Ph.D. in 1959 at Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology under Nathan Rosen. Peres spent most of his academic career at Technion, where in 1988 he was appointed distinguished professor of physics. Peres is well known for his work relating quantum mechanics and information theory, an approach which is extensively used in his textbook referenced below. Among other things, he helped to develop the Peres‚ÄìHorodecki criterion for quantum entanglement, as well as the concept of quantum teleportation, and collaborated with others on quantum information and special relativity. He also introduced the Peres metric and researched the Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi‚ÄìEinstein equation in general relativity. With M. Feingold, he published work in quantum chaos that is known to mathematicians as the Feingold-Peres conjecture and to physicists as the Feingold-Peres theory. He authored a textbook, Quantum Theory: Concepts and Methods, of which he wrote, :The purpose of this book is to clarify the conceptual meaning of quantum theory, and to explain some of the mathematical methods that it utilizes. This text is not concerned with specialized topics such as atomic structure, or strong or weak interactions, but with the very foundations of the theory. This is not, however, a book on the philosophy of science. The approach is pragmatic and strictly instrumentalist. This attitude will undoubtedly antagonize some readers, but it has its own logic: quantum phenomena do not occur in a Hilbert space, they occur in a laboratory. N. David Mermin called the book \\"a treasure trove of novel perspectives on quantum mechanics\\" and said that Peres' choice of topics is \\"a catalogue of common omissions\\" from other approaches. Among its substantial discussion of the failure of hidden variable theories, the book includes a FORTRAN program for testing whether a list of vectors forms a Kochen‚ÄìSpecker configuration. Michael Nielsen wrote of the textbook, \\"Revelation! Suddenly, all the key results of 30 years of work (several of those results due to Asher) were distilled into beautiful and simple explanations.\\" Peres downplayed the importance of the uncertainty principle, giving it only a single mention in his index, which points to that same page of the index. Peres claimed that the resolution to the Einstein‚ÄìPodolsky‚ÄìRosen puzzle of quantum entanglement, often called \\"spooky action at a distance\\", lies in the fact that quantum states are information. Peres wrote, \\"Information is not just an abstract notion. It requires a physical carrier, and the latter is (approximately) localized. After all, it was the business of the Bell Telephone Company to transport information from one telephone to another telephone, in a different location. [...] When Alice measures her spin, the information she gets is localized at her position, and will remain so until she decides to broadcast it. Absolutely nothing happens at Bob's location. [...] It is only when Alice informs Bob of the result she got (by mail, telephone, radio, or by means other than material carrier, which is naturally restricted to the speed of light) that Bob realizes that his particle has a definite pure state.\\" He died in Haifa, Israel.

It is a sparsely populated region extending from the west coast of Western Australia, about north and south of its administrative centre of Geraldton and inland to east of Wiluna in the Gibson Desert. It has a total area of , and a permanent population of about 52,000 people, more than half of those in Geraldton. Earlier names The western portion of this region was known earlier as \\"The Murchison\\" based on the river of the same name, and the similarly named goldfield. Economy The Mid West region has a diversified economy that varies with the geography and climate. Near the coast, annual rainfall of between allows intensive agriculture. Further inland, annual rainfall decreases to less than , and here the economy is dominated by mining of iron ore, gold, nickel and other mineral resources. Geraldton is an important hub for the tourism industry. The Mid West also has the highest value fishing industry in Western Australia, with Geraldton the hub of the Western Rock Lobster industry. Western Rock Lobster netted almost $234.5 million in revenue for WA in the 2012‚Äì13 financial year, making it Australia's most valuable single-species wild capture fishery. Gross Regional Product for the Mid West in 2013 was AU$6,000,000,000 (AU$6bn). On 25 August 2015 The Hon. Terry Redman, MLA, Minister for Regional Development, launched the \\"Mid West Regional Blueprint\\"; an aspirational growth and development plan created by the Mid West Development Commission for the region. The Blueprint proposes strategies against five priority pillars to drive or reduce barriers to, regional growth and development in the Mid West. The Blueprint strategies are intended to focus on the region‚Äôs key strengths and the identification of regional opportunities, providing a guide for regional development to 2050. Space science =Square Kilometre Array= Due to its relative isolation from radio-frequency interference, the Mid West region was selected to host one of two primary radiotelescope locations of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) project. When fully operational in 2024, this AU$2bn project will be 50 times more sensitive than any existing radio interferometer instrument; it will generate more data than the current global Internet traffichttp://www.skatelescope.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/SKA-Brochure.pdf and be capable of surveying the sky more than ten thousand to a million times faster than what is possible today. The radiotelescope antennae and the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory (MRO) are located near Boolardy, Western Australia, approximately 315 km northeast of Geraldton, with logistics and science support provided by CSIRO from their facilities in Geraldton. High- capacity optical fibre cables connect the SKA telescope to the MRO support facility in Geraldton and to the Pawsley Supercomputing Centre in Perth, Western Australia. =WA Space Centre= Located at Yatharagga, 40 km from Mingenew (100 km SE of Geraldton), the WA Space Centre is an $8,000,000 114 ha satellite park owned and operated by Space Australia, a subsidiary company of the Swedish Space Corporation (SSC). The park is located in one of several Radio Quiet Zones in the region, making it an ideal location for radioastronomy. The SSC is the largest commercial operator of satellite tracking ground station facilities. The facilities include compounds operated by NASA, The European Space Agency, CSIRO, MOBLAS and VLBI, amongst others. Local government The local government areas in the Mid West region are Carnamah, Chapman Valley, Coorow, Cue, Greater Geraldton, Irwin, Meekatharra, Mingenew, Morawa, Mount Magnet, Murchison, Northampton, Perenjori, Sandstone, Three Springs, Wiluna, and Yalgoo.

Burroughs Jr. and Billy Burroughs. He bears the name of both his father and his great-grandfather, William Seward Burroughs I, the original inventor of the Burroughs adding machine. He wrote three novels, two of which were published as Speed (1970) and Kentucky Ham (1973). His third novel, Prakriti Junction, begun in 1977, was never completed, although extracts from it were included in his third and final published work Cursed From Birth. Burroughs Jr. underwent a liver transplant in 1976 after developing cirrhosis. He died in 1981, at the age of 33, from alcoholism and liver failure. Burroughs Jr. appears briefly in the 1983 documentary Burroughs: The Movie, about his father, in which he discusses his childhood, his liver problems, and his relationship with his family. In the documentary, John Giorno calls him \\"the last beatnik.\\"  Childhood  Burroughs was born in Conroe, Texas, to William S. Burroughs and Joan Vollmer. His mother was addicted to amphetamines, and his father was a heroin addict. Herbert Huncke, a friend of his parents, relates that when Joan was pregnant he would drive into Houston to obtain Benzedrine, an inhaled amphetamine, for her. On September 6, 1951, Billy's father accidentally shot and killed his mother in a drunken game of 'William Tell' in Mexico City. In chapter three of his second novel, Kentucky Ham, Burroughs relates his memory of the day his mother was shot dead, as well as the subsequent reunion with his father after he was freed from a Mexico City prison. While his father stayed in Mexico, Billy went to live with his paternal grandparents, Mortimer and Laura Lee Burroughs, in St. Louis, Missouri. In spring 1952, when Billy was nearly 5, he moved with his grandparents to Palm Beach, Florida, where they relocated their store, Cobblestone Gardens. By his own account, Billy said his grandparents were kind and reassuring; yet as they grew older, and he grew into adolescence, they were unable to relate. When Billy was 13, his grandparents asked William S. Burroughs to take Billy back. He agreed, and Billy was sent alone by air to Tangiers, Morocco, to live with his father. In Tangiers, Billy was introduced to marijuana, and he experienced several episodes of grown men attempting to rape him. By his father's own admission, the visit was a failed attempt to rehabilitate their relationship. After Burroughs' lover, Ian Sommerville, convinced William that his son was irrevocably homesick, Billy returned to Palm Beach. When Billy was fifteen, he accidentally shot his best friend in the neck with a rifle, causing an almost fatal wound. This event caused him to suffer a nervous breakdown. According to Kentucky Ham, Billy thought his friend was dead and ran away from home to seek refuge in a girlfriend's family fallout shelter. He planned to flee to California, convinced that he was a murderer. Yet his friend lived, and the police ruled the wounding unintentional. Still, this act did not go unnoticed in the exclusive Palm Beach community, and the story of the manner in which his mother had perished at the hands of his father again gained wide circulation. Billy was sent to a mental hospital in St. Louis for help, but threats to run away caused Mortimer and Laura to bring their grandson home. Bill then attended Green Valley, an alternative school based on the principles of English educator A. S. Neill, in Orange City, Florida, from 1965 to 1966.  Drug addiction  Living in a wealthy section of Palm Beach, Billy Burroughs began to spend more time out of his grandparents' care and beyond the reach of local authorities. Burroughs became addicted to amphetamines and resorted to criminal behavior to obtain them, forging prescriptions and visiting doctors' offices to steal prescription pads. He was soon arrested, but he was not an adult and had the tragic story of his parents' life to temper criminal proceedings against him. Nevertheless, his second novel begins with his condemnation to a four-year suspended sentence and required admission to the Federal Narcotics Farm at Lexington in Kentucky. This prison was one of two U.S. Federal prison hospitals treating persons convicted of federal drug crimes in the United States from 1935 until 1973. After being released on parole in 1968, he quit his addiction to amphetamines and returned to The Green Valley School, a private institution run by Reverend Von Hilsheimer in Orange City, Florida. The Green Valley School was where Burroughs met his future wife, a 17-year-old Jewish girl from Savannah, Georgia named Karen Perry, who came from a privileged background. The two formed a romantic relationship and were married in 1969, settling in Savannah. Burroughs began to write; Perry worked as a waitress.  Alcoholism  The marriage disintegrated in 1974 when Karen left Burroughs because of his chronic alcoholism. Despite the publication of his novels, he was increasingly alienated from friends and family, and there were long periods when his whereabouts were unknown. When he showed up in Boulder, Colorado, to visit his father and Allen Ginsberg at Ginsberg's Buddhist institute at the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics, he had the appearance of a \\"derelict.\\" In 1976, during a dinner with Ginsberg and his father, Burroughs began vomiting blood. When the heaving would not stop, he was admitted to Colorado General Hospital, where it was discovered that he was suffering from cirrhosis of the liver. The hospital was one of only two institutions in 1976 that performed liver transplants. Thomas Starzl had performed over 100 transplants, with a survival rate of less than 30%. Nevertheless, Billy profited from Starzl's care. Although Burroughs spent months in and out of the hospital, and there were many serious complications, the operation was successful. However, despite the obvious risks, Burroughs kept drinking. Many people, notably Ginsberg, tried to encourage him to quit, but Burroughs's self-destructive behavior continued. Eventually, Burroughs began to express hostility and anger towards his father. He published a damning article in Esquire, explaining how his life was \\"ruined\\" by his father‚Äôs actions. The estrangement between father and son was never reconciled.  Death  In 1981, Burroughs stopped taking his anti- rejection drugs. Allen Ginsberg was notified that Burroughs had returned to Florida to reconnect with the founder of the Green Valley School. Shortly after, Burroughs was found lying chilled, drunk, and exhausted in a shallow ditch at the side of a DeLand, Florida, highway on March 2. A passerby took him to a local hospital, where he died the following day at 6:35 a.m. of acute gastrointestinal hemorrhage associated with micronodular cirrhosis. He was 33 years old. Burroughs was cremated and his ashes buried in Boulder, Colorado.  Writing style  William S. Burroughs Jr. wrote two autobiographical novels, and was working on a third. He began writing poetry at the Green Valley School when he was 21 in 1968 and completed his first novel Speed in 1970. The novels relate the experiences of a teenage runaway in the early 1960s, and are comparable in style and content to both Jack Kerouac‚Äôs On the Road and his father‚Äôs Junkie. His friendships, his drug use, and his social commentary make each novel interesting, if at times unpolished. Some time after the death of Burroughs Jr., his father invited David Ohle to edit the manuscript of his late son's unfinished novel Prakriti Junction. The manuscript was unpublishable so, instead, Ohle compiled a work from the manuscript, the last journals and poems of Burroughs Jr., and correspondence and interviews with those who knew him.

It consists of a scarlet British-style military pattern tunic, complete with a high-neck collar and blue breeches with yellow stripe identifying a cavalry history.  Constables and non-commissioned officers  Constables (Cst) and non-commissioned officers (NCOs) wear the red serge tunic with blue gorget patches on their collars and epaulettes of navy blue. Metal collar dogs of the RCMP badge are worn on the neck. Constables and NCOs wear embroidered firearms qualification badges on the bottom of their left sleeve, and their embroidered specialist trade badge on the right sleeve. If a second specialist badge is earned, the least current is worn below the firearms qualification badges. Embroidered NCO rank badges of corporal (Cpl), and sergeant (Sgt) are worn on the right sleeve below the specialist trade badge (if any). Staff sergeant (S/Sgt), sergeant major (S/Maj), and staff sergeant major (S/S/Maj) are worn on the bottom of the right sleeve. With RCMP badges, no badge is worn directly above a badge containing a crown. Service stars, each designating 5 years of service, are worn on the left sleeve. In \\"review order,\\" the riding breeches (jodhpurs) are \\"midnight blue\\" (virtually black) which bulge at the thigh in keeping with traditional cut with a yellow strapping (stripe) down the outside seam of each leg, and laced closed beneath the boots. The breeches are worn with braces. Finishing off the Red Serge are brown leather riding boots, known as high browns or Strathcona boots, with spurs, and a brown wide-brimmed felt campaign hat with a glass-flat brim. The ever-present side-arm, currently either a Smith & Wesson model 5946 or 3953, is carried in a brown leather holster on a brown Sam Browne belt. There is a brown leather pouch for carrying handcuffs and another for two spare pistol magazines. The Cst, Cpl, Sgt, and S/Sgt Sam Browne cross strap travels over the left shoulder. A S/Maj may have a whistle and chain on the cross strap. A white pistol lanyard is worn around the neck and connected to the side arm. \\"Review order\\" may be worn with \\"full\\" Sam Browne, or \\"stripped\\" Sam Browne where no lanyard, pistol, holster, or pouches are worn. Female RCMP members formerly wore a modified version of the Red Serge for review order without the high collar but now wear the same pattern of tunic as their male colleagues. \\"Walking-out order\\" is worn for more formal occasions. Walking-out order consists of the red serge tunic, a blue and gold waist belt with brass buckle, stirrup overalls, pants known in RCMP slang as \\"banana pants\\", with congress boots and spurs. Formerly, female RCMP members wore the same tunic and waist belt as their male counterparts, as well as a long skirt and black shoes. However, a 1990 an order in council stipulated that female members of the RCMP would wear the same Review Order uniform as male Mounties.Bonny Reilly Schmidt, 2013, \\"Women in Red Serge: Female Police Bodies and the Disruption to the Image of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police\\" unpublished PhD thesis, History Department, Simon Fraser University, p.149  Commissioned officers  Junior commissioned officers (inspectors and above) wear similar red serge tunics; however, their collars are solid blue as are their sleeve cuffs. Officers do not wear any qualification, specialist, or service badges on their tunics. Rank is worn in the British style of metal \\"pips\\" and \\"crowns\\" on the epaulettes. The yellow stripe on officers' breeches and males' overalls is finer material and wider than Cst and NCOs. Officers' \\"high brown\\" boots are different from the Cst and NCOs. Officers' Sam Brownes have D-rings for sword frogs, and the cross straps travel over the right shoulder. Senior officers wear a metallic belt‚Äînot a leather Sam Browne‚Äîand gold-plated shoulder cords in full dress. Officers have the option of wearing a campaign hat or forage cap with Red Serge. The mess dress worn by commissioned officers has a scarlet cutaway jacket. Prior to 1904, a white, topi-style of pith helmet was standard issue; however, plainsmen often preferred to ride wearing non-regulation cowboy hats and these subsequently became uniform issue in the form of the campaign hat. An RCMP officer wearing the Red Serge is an internationally recognized Canadian icon. The Red Serge is not worn as working dress when an officer is on normal duty, but is reserved for occasions such as civic ceremonies, musical rides, ceremonial parades, as a visual representative of the security force for government dignitaries, and during public relations-- related special events such as school career days or guard duty at Parliament in Ottawa. Members also march in funerals for police officers wearing the traditional Red Serge. The Red Serge is also worn by RCMP members during special personal events, such as the wedding ceremony of a fellow officer, where it is not uncommon for an entire detachment of a small community to wear the Red Serge as an honour guard for the bride and groom at their wedding ceremony. Usually, if the groom is a member, he will be married in his Red Serge, in lieu of civilian formal attire. History The red serge was adopted as part of its standard uniform by the NWMP from its establishment in 1873. In its first form, it consisted of a loose-fitting \\"Norfolk jacket\\" supplied from Canadian Militia stocks. While comfortable and practical, the Norfolk jacket lacked smartness and it was replaced after 1876 by scarlet full-dress and undress tunics manufactured by British suppliers. An elaborate ceremonial tunic of hussar style was prescribed for officers but infrequently worn. Scarlet continued to be the base color for all occasions; partially to distinguish the new Canadian force from blue-clad US Army units and partially because of the significance of red coats in the British military culture inherited from the Militia. The NWMP Dress Regulations of 1886 provided for a simpler officers' full dress based on that of British and Canadian dragoon regiments. The 1890 regulations authorized the adoption of white patrol jackets for summer wear and brown duck (khaki) for patrol duty. The red serge was by now sufficiently well-established to serve as an icon of the NWMP, though increasingly relegated to dress and garrison wear. Photographs, however, show red serge still being worn by individual constables on field duty into the early 1900s. A dark-blue, patrol \\"frock tunic\\", of the same design as the red serge, was adopted in 1904 as alternative wear for ordinary duties. A mixture of scarlet, blue, and brown tunics were worn, according to circumstances, until after 1920 when the red serge became a dress item, with brown tunics as a standard part of the normal work uniform. This remains the practice to the present day. In popular culture The red serge is almost always used in depictions of Mounties in popular culture, such as Dudley Do- Right or Rose Marie (1936 film). During one of his stints in the World Wrestling Federation, Jacques Rougeau wore a modified red serge outfit to play his character of \\"The Mountie\\"; however, due to protests by the RCMP, the WWF mentioned repeatedly during his matches that he was not a \\"true representative of the Mounties.\\" Eventually litigation prevented Rougeau from appearing in Canada as The Mountie and the gimmick was dropped. In the Canadian-produced series Due South, produced from 1994 to 1999, the character Constable Benton Fraser of the RCMP wears the Red Serge on a normal basis. The character is a traditionalist who firmly believes in wearing that over the blue or brown uniforms, though he is seen wearing all three in the series. In the Canadian- American produced TV drama series \\"When Calls the Heart\\", the character Constable Jack Thornton of the Royal North-West Mounted Police is usually seen wearing a red serge.

In 1942, at the age of 9, Burack, her parents, and her sisters Miriam and Sarah were forced into hiding after German soldiers instructed the Jewish residents of Nowy Korczyn to march to the railway station for \\"relocation.\\" Her parents, aware that this was a euphemism for deportation to concentration camps, slipped out of the line unseen to escape. In the confusion, her older sister Rita became separated from the family and boarded the train; she was eventually taken to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. The Radza family sought refuge with a Polish Catholic family, Stephania and Jozef Macugowski. Jozef was an old friend of Louis Radza's, and had previously offered assistance if the family ever required it. To hide the Radza family, the Macugowskis dug a secret trench beneath the floorboards of their home. The crawlspace was no more than wide, long, and deep. The family would spend the next two and a half years hidden within, their presence a secret not only from the outside world, but from the Macugowskis' children and elderly parents as well. Over that span of time, several other Jewish people sought refuge with the Macugowskis. Eventually, nine refugees, including a cousin of the Radzas, were packed inside. Much later, Burack's sister Miriam described their packed state to reporters: \\"When one turned on his side, the others would have to do the same. We were like sardines.\\" The Macugowskis would come down at night to bring the family bread, water, and a bucket for waste. The Radzas, despairing their situation, sometimes begged them for poisoned food or a gun to end their misery, but the Macugowskis refused. Burack later recalled that they insisted, \\"As long as we are alive, we will save you. On one occasion, Jozef brought the family unleavened bread so they could observe the Jewish Passover. In 1945, the German High Command took over the Macugowskis house as a local headquarters and forced the Macugowskis out. According to Burack's recollection, the Radzas took out their prayer book, said Kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead, and \\"all thanked God that we were going to die.\\" However, the Macugowskis were able to convince the German soldiers that they should be allowed to stay on as the home's caretakers. Once or twice a week, after waiting until all the German soldiers were asleep, Jozef and Stephania were able to bring a small amount of supplies for the family. At one point, the Germans in the house were overheard discussing efforts to track down one remaining Jewish family rumored to still be hidden in town. Jozef was able to spread a rumor in a nearby town that this family had drowned in the Wista River while fleeing the Nazis, and the search was called off.  Liberation and move to Israel  In 1945, the town was liberated by the Red Army. The Radza family, at last, emerged from the crawlspace beneath the Macugowskis' home. It was the first time they had seen daylight in two and a half years, and it burned their eyes at first. Their legs were so wobbly that Soviet soldiers believed they were drunk and beat them, thinking they were hiding vodka. Their vocal cords had atrophied because they had not spoken above a whisper during their entire confinement. Jozef took the family to a town some miles away where no one knew them, and made them promise that they would never reveal who had protected them. Nearly six months after the war, the family was reunited with Rita, who had survived the camp at Bergen-Belsen. The Razdas eventually lost track of the Macugowskis. Burack was given false identity papers that declared her a war orphan and, at no more than 12 years old, was smuggled into the part of Palestine that would soon become the state of Israel. She was the only member of her family to emigrate to Israel. Her family remained in Poland, visiting her occasionally at the girls' school where she lived. While living in Israel, she served in Haganah, the Jewish paramilitary organization. She remained in service when it became the Israel Defense Forces in 1948. She would ultimately remain in Israel for twelve years before emigrating to the United States.  Political activism in the United States  After twelve years in Israel, Burack moved to the United States in 1958 to work for the Israeli Consulate in New York City. She eventually settled in Westchester County, New York, where she would marry Robert H. Burack. Burack's sisters had also settled in and around the New York area with their families. The Buracks split their time between Westchester and Palm Beach, Florida, for the remainder of their lives. They had one son, Jeffrey Burack. Through her adult life, Burack maintained her search for the Polish couple that had saved her and her family. Burack was politically active for her entire adult life, and used her wealth philanthropically to further Jewish, Israeli, and Democratic Party causes. She was known as a political and social leader, and both \\"Israeli prime ministers and American presidents call[ed] on her for her political activism.\\" She is known to have worked with the United Jewish Appeal, the Westchester-Putnam Boy Scouts of America Council, the Mental Health Association of Westchester County,Untitled memo dated April 18, 1990, Mental Health Association of Westchester County. Access date 2018-01-30. and the David Yellin College of Education, among numerous others. She was the chairman of the board of Palm Beach Israel Bonds at the time of her death in 2001. She met Jimmy Carter in 1975, before he was officially nominated as the Democratic Party candidate for the 1976 election, and later organized his election campaign in Westchester. Burack was a marcher at Carter's inauguration parade after he won the 1976 presidential election. In 1981, Burack ran as a Democrat for a seat in Westchester County government, but was defeated by the Republican incumbent, John L. Messina, by 2,500 votes. In 1984, Senator Joseph R. Pisani introduced a resolution to the New York State Senate to honor Burack for her long record of service to the Westchester community. In 1986, Burack finally made contact with Stephania and Jozef Macugowski. In collaboration with the David Yellin College, Burack arranged for the Macugowskis to be flown to New York for a special recognition ceremony. The Polish couple was recognized as Righteous Among the Nations, an honorific given by the State of Israel to denote non-Jews who risked their lives to protect and shelter Jewish people during the Holocaust. Zahava's husband Robert died in 1988. Zahava died from cancer on September 28, 2001.

Catasauqua Creek, about 6 miles below the Lehigh Gap and from the company offices in Mauch Chunk, was chosen for a new joint venture by LC&N; and David Thomas, the Lehigh Crane Iron Works. After building infrastructure, including a firebrick works, a second blast furnace was under construction when on July 4th, 1840 the first hot blast furnace in North America produced Anthracite pig iron, a necessary precursor (feed stock) to producing wrought iron and cast iron. In that moment, the world changed. The Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company (LC&N;) opened up and had a hand in building or financing the majority of the 'works of man' from the virgin frontier which can now seen recorded on bottom half of this 1890s USGS topographical map, including directly building or helping finance very many of the railroads shown, many of the towns, and six of the first ten successful blast furnaces in North America (In the Catasauqua suburb of Allentown just to the southeast of this map). Note the lack of any modern road network‚Äîlacking automobiles, motoring clubs connecting towns to one another were not yet formed so political forces hadn't yet begun turning county tracks and dirt & gravel toll roads into paved roads. Just off the map is Mauch Chunk (today's Jim Thorpe, PA and site of the first two Blast furnaces attempted in the US by LC&N;) below the shadow of Mount Pisgah at the end of Pisgah Ridge shown above at map bottom right. This area is just below the loop of the Lehigh Gorge show along the right bottom third edge. Opposite the mouth of that gorge was the first and now lost community of transient workers, Lausanne Landing, that housed foresters, boat builders, and miners pioneering the area above the Lehigh Gap in 'years-long' expeditions. Also near Lausanne's Landing Tavern, in 1805 was built the toll booth of the Lausanne-Nescopeck Turnpike were situated in the low flats near the mouth of Nesquehoning Creek (about 1/3rd the way up the map right side). To the west, nearly 15 miles across the map lies Tamaqua which also connects via water gaps of the Schuylkill Valley to the plains below the Blue Mountain escarpments. Tamaqua is located literally just off the lower left corner of this map. It follows the majority of the coal lands of the new LCAN lie along the bottom third of this map--the Panther Creek Valley. LC&N; also had owned other coal deposits north of the E-to-W line of the Nesquehoning Anthracite iron or Anthracite 'Pig Iron' is the substance created by the smelting together of anthracite coal and iron ore, that is using Anthracite coal instead of charcoal to smelt iron ores -- and was an important historic advance in the late-1830s enabling great acceleration the industrial revolution in Europe and North America.Thomas, Samuel, History Unlike many seminal advances, the contributors, place and date of this epoch are well recorded within specific moments in the late 1830s. The first repeatable and reliably successful furnaces and smelts were managed by the same person in both the United Kingdom and the United States, in the principal control and supervision of Ironmaster David Thomas who had begun experimenting with attempts to use locally available Wales anthracite deposits as early as 1820 soon after he became in charge at Yniscedewin Iron Works in Wales. About this 1837-38 timeframe experiments were also being made in Pennsylvania near Port Carbon, and in Mauch Chunk, but with overall better success than in Wales. White, Hazard and the LC&N; Co. had begun systematic experiments to smelt using anthracite in two furnaces in Mauch Chunk in 1832‚Äì1837 with intermittent but sporadically improved successes using cold blast processes with two differently designed furnaces. The first American smelt of Anthracite Pig Iron was performed July 4, 1840 by principal-partners David Thomas, Josiah White and Erskine Hazard at their Lehigh Crane Iron Works in their first hot blast furnace along Catasauqua Creek aided by Samuel Thomas and the employees of the LCIW, in what became Catasauqua in Northampton County, Pennsylvania. The technology enabled industries the chance to produce cast iron sufficient to demand and eventually adapt production to also feed the demand to generate wrought iron and steel. These useful materials are achieved by adding additional processing -- by taking pig iron as an ingredient into a reverberatory furnace (and in later years, a Bessemer converter). Anthracite, also known as stone coal or rock coal, is very difficult to ignite, mine, clean, and break into smaller chunks and requires correct conditions to build heat or hold temperature and sustain burning--which oft depend upon the size and uniformity of the coal particles. Yet American cities were cramped for fuels, woodlands were exhausted near bigger towns and Philadelphia, largest city in America needed fuels for mills and foundries as well to sustain manufacturing. Inventor and industrialist Josiah White (owner of a wire mill, foundry and nail factory), had determined how to burn anthracite in iron working processing furnaces during the War of 1812, but its use in smelting operations was hit or miss, dependent upon the material packing geometries of any particular charging load in a cold blast furnace. The earlier development of coking of bituminous coal, as well anthracite coke enabled the smelting of iron using local coal sources with cold blast air in blast furnaces after the latter 1830s allowed the production of the vast quantities of iron that built the fundamental infrastructure of the early North American Industrial Revolution -- which was built on iron products and only some steel. At the time, iron was used minimally with respect to wood. Even most railroad tracks were laid with wooden rails, sometimes covered by iron strapping. As more iron became available, more uses were found for iron, creating a cycle of increasing demand, experimentation and improvements-- part of the revolution in industrial revolution. Development of the process During the United States' first energy crisis stands of forest near larger towns and America's Eastern Seaboard cities became farther and farther from population and factory centers, raising the price of fuel for heating and smithies, especially clean burning charcoal -- long the fuel of preference for smelting and glass making, creating a decades long search for alternative fuels. By mid-1792 prominent Philadelphians had formed the Lehigh Coal Mine Company (LHCM Co.) to bring Anthracite to cities reachable via the Delaware River Valley, especially Philadelphia -- the nation's largest and most industrialized city, though no one fully understood how to use anthracite as a sole fuel--just that it 'could' burn 'some' of the time with a hot enough base fire, so could augment furnace fuels. The LHCM Co. had great difficulty getting many ark-loads of coal to the docks in Philadelphia, much less having capabilities to make reliable deliveries of the fuel to industries risking its use, for the trip from Lausanne along the Lehigh River's variable water height and many rocks and rapids then surviving the over on the equally untamed Delaware River. In the midst of the War of 1812 iron industry magnate Josiah White set his foremen to systematically conducting experiments as how 'stone coal' could be made to burn reliably. It was recognized as some use aiding other fuels, and pack animal loads occasionally reached the city, which had mills and foundries desperately needing to circumvent the British Naval Blockade, so Bituminous Coal coastal shipments up from Virginia might resume. These experiments established a bottom draught and closed doors (reflection or reverberatory furnace techniques) were the key. Before the war, Baltimore, New York, Newark, New Haven, Boston, and Philadelphia industrialists were importing Bituminous via shipload from Virginia and Great Britain, and these supplies became difficult to obtain or blocked politically by the war and its preceding embargoes on British goods. After the war, the sanctions continued until various boundary disputes were resolved as far away as The Oregon Country and the Columbia River basin. =Historical backdrop= Meanwhile, between 1814-1818 industries along the Eastern Seaboard were still thirsting for energy relief when inquiries to the LHCM Co. by Hazard & White indicated the operation & rights of the company were available. Frustrated by the snail-like progress of improvements that would become the Schuylkill Canal, White & Hazard applied to the Pennsylvania legislature for the rights to improve and operate navigations upon the rapids-strewn Lehigh River initiating the process that lead to the Lehigh Canal--beginning regular high volume & reliable coal deliveries in late 1820 -- and the great changes a flood of anthracite would create in the next century. =Iron from Anthracite smelting= Research into the smelting of iron using anthracite coal (without coking it first) began in the 1820s in Wales by Thomas, experiments in France, most notably by Gueymard and Robin at Vizille in 1827, and in the 1830s in Pottsville & Mauch Chunk, Pennsylvania.Bartholomew, Metz, & Kneis, pp.4-6 Early attempts tried to gradually substitute anthracite for other fuels, such as coke or charcoal, but all failed due to the use of cold blast techniques, which generated insufficient heat to keep the anthracite in regenerative combustion.Bartholomew & Metz, pp. 14‚Äì15 In the same time-frame, Thomas had also continued experimenting with mixes of Anthracite and other fuels, before he combined those experiments and the new hot blast processing. In the United States, where the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company (LC&N;) had begun shipping anthracite to Philadelphia in 1820 because the principles could not obtain sufficient fuels for their iron works at the 'Falls of the Schuylkill' --so had built the Lehigh Canal and taken over the works of the haphazard Lehigh Coal Mine Company--by the late 1820s having established works that were running smoothly, after building America's second operating railroad in 1827, they'd great interest in exploiting the great anthracite deposits of Schuylkill County for ironmaking, which mills foundries were their principle businesses. The Franklin Institute, in 1830, offered a gold medal to the manufacturer of the greatest quantity of anthracite iron, and Nicholas Biddle and his associates offered a prize of $5,000 to the first individual to smelt a certain quantity of iron ore within a given time, using anthracite. The Lehigh Coal & Navigation, by then an industrial giant of the times, also offered free water power and discount rates on coal and shipping to encourage the development of the process.Korson, p. 104 The first key breakthrough occurred in 1828‚Äì29, when Scotsman James Beaumont Neilson patented the hot blast technique & process, which he had conceived in an attempt to improve the efficiency of conventionally fueled furnaces.Bartholomew & Metz, p. 16 The first person to employ the hot blast technique to anthracite smelting was Dr. Frederick W. Gesenhainer, who filed for a patent on the process in 1831 and received it in 1833. In 1836, he tried smelting anthracite iron on a practical scale at his property, Valley Furnace, near Pottsville, Pennsylvania, while in the same year White & Hazard's LC&N; Co. built two experimental blast furnaces in Mauch Chunk. He produced a small quantity of iron, but due to mechanical breakdowns, could not keep the furnace in operation for more than two months.Bartholomew & Metz, p. 17 While distinguished visitors, including Governor Joseph Ritner, acknowledged his success, he sold out his share in Valley Furnace and went to New York City.Korson, p. 106 The research was proceeding along parallel lines across the Atlantic. George Crane, owner, and David Thomas, superintendent of the Yniscedwyn Iron Works, had themselves conceived of the idea of using hot blast to smelt anthracite. Thomas was sent to Scotland to examine Neilson's installation and reproduced it at Yniscedwyn. Crane filed for a British patent on smelting iron with anthracite and hot blast in 1836 and received it in 1837. By the time the patent was sealed, Yniscedwyn was producing about 35 tons of iron using anthracite only as a fuel.Bartholomew & Metz, pp. 17‚Äì18 Inspired both by Geisenhainer and Crane (whose success was closely followed by the LC&N;), experiments in the US continued. Baughman, Guiteau and Company used an old furnace near Mauch Chunk to produce some anthracite iron during late 1837. They built another experimental furnace nearby, which was worked for about two months during fall and winter 1838 and for some time in 1839,Bartholomew & Metz, p. 19Gordon, pp. 155‚Äì156 but mechanical deficiencies led them to abandon the furnace at the end of 1839.Korson, p. 107 In the meantime, Pioneer Furnace, in Pottsville, was blown in using anthracite fuel in 1839.Gordon, p. 156 It was built by William Lyman obtained the aid of a Welsh emigrant, Benjamin Perry, who was familiar with Neilson's process and the Yniscedwyn works, for the blowing-in. The furnace ran for three months on anthracite alone and fulfilled the conditions to win the $5,000 prize.Gordon p. 156Bartholomew & Metz, pp. 31‚Äì32 In the design of Pioneer Furnace, Lyman had also been assisted by David Thomas, who had arrived in the United States in May 1839. Thomas was engaged by the LC&N; to set up the Lehigh Crane Iron Company and its first furnace at Catasauqua, which went into blast in 1840, along with five other anthracite furnaces. This marked the commercial establishment of anthracite iron production in the United States.Bartholomew & Metz, pp. 32‚Äì33Gordon, pp. 156‚Äì157 Decline The opening of bituminous coal deposits suitable for coking in the western part of the Allegheny Plateau resulted in the gradual displacement of anthracite as a fuel. The production of coke-fired furnaces overtook that of anthracite-fired furnaces in 1875,Gordon, p. 158 and the last anthracite furnaces in the US, the former Lock Ridge Iron Company, converted to coke in 1914.Bartholomew & Metz, p. 79 Notes Footnotes References  * Ferrous alloys Iron Metalworking Steelmaking Smelting ","title":"Anthracite iron"},{"id":"1364070","title":"The Fortune Cookie"},{"id":"1364072","text":"Xsan () is Apple Inc.'s storage area network (SAN) or clustered file system for macOS.

KDWB's radio format is Top 40/CHR. Its transmitter is located in Shoreview, while its studios are in St. Louis Park. The station is owned by iHeartMedia. History Between its AM and FM frequencies, KDWB has been an uninterrupted Top 40 outlet since 1959. Originally starting out at 630 kHz, the station's owners (Doubleday Broadcasting of Garden City, New York) purchased the 101.3 MHz frequency in 1976, later transferring the entire format there. =63 KDWB= KDWB's origins on the AM dial date back to 1951, at 1590 kHz. The station began as a collaboration between three brothers who named it WCOW, and it played country western and old-time music. In the early days, WCOW, which was licensed to South St. Paul (its original city of license), signed on with a cowbell. The studios, transmitter, broadcast towers and offices were located at 255 Radio Drive South in Woodbury. In 1949, the three brothers, Al, Vic, and Nick Tedesco applied to the Federal Communications Commission for the purchase of WSHB in Stillwater. The application was approved, and on March 15, 1949, WAVN in Stillwater signed on the air as a 5,000 watt non-directional day-timer with 500-watt pre-sunrise authority. The Tedesco brothers attempted to get into television on channel 17 the next year, but financial backing fell through. (The channel 17 allocation was taken by Twin Cities Public Television in 1965.) Since the initial purchase of WAVN in 1949, the Tedesco brothers acquired and/or sold several other radio stations, spanning over 50 years, sometimes with partners. On April 18, 1994, after 36 years, the 630 kHz frequency went dark. The owners, Midcontinent Media, sold the property, and the state of the art facilities were dismantled, salvaged and/or destroyed to make room for the construction of the-then State Farm Insurance Companies regional headquarters. WCOW was not very successful, so the station transitioned to being a female-oriented station including commercials aimed at its target audience, with a heavy saturation long term ad contract, with the call letters changing to WISK in 1957, and switched its frequency to 630 kHz the next year. Again, the format was not popular, and the station was soon sold the following year to Crowell-Collier Broadcasting Company, owners of KFWB in Los Angeles and KEWB in San Francisco. The top 40 format of those stations, with strong California/West Coast style influence, was brought to Minnesota, and the call letters changed to KDWB in 1959. \\"Channel 63, KDWB\\" then began its long uninterrupted run as a pop music station, and quickly became a major competitor to the established WDGY, which had been playing a pop music format for three years by that point. KDWB and WDGY were fierce rivals throughout the 1960s and 1970s; during that time, both stations gained more competition, as \\"Request Radio\\" AM 950 and FM 104.1 KRSI (1968), KSTP (1972), and WYOO (1974) picked up the format. On-air staff and other programming During the 1960s and 1970s, Program Director Chuck Blore referred to the seven air-shifts in 24 hours as \\"The 7 Swinging Gentlemen\\". They included: * \\"True\\" Don Bleu * Bob Shannon * Lou Reigert (Lou Waters) Syndicated and/or non-local originating broadcasts included American Top 40 with Casey Kasem, which aired Sunday evenings, and for over ten years, it was the highest rated program in the Twin Cities market. Additional syndicated programming included \\"Jim Ladd's Innerview.\\" Program Directors included Chuck Blore and Bob Shannon. The FCC In March 1961, KDWB allegedly became the first station to have been fined by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). It apparently had to pay $10,000 because of repeated willful violations of nighttime broadcast power restrictions on the AM band. =History of 101.3 FM= After two years of wrangling and obtaining start-up funds, WPBC officially signed on the air on October 18, 1949. The station was owned by the People's Broadcasting Company, founded by former WCCO announcer Bill Stewart and his wife Becky Ann. In contrast to WCCO and KSTP, WPBC carried no network programming, and was broadcast live and local all day. The station in the early years played a variety of MOR pop music and standards, and was even considered an innovator in the concept of singing jingles. As it was limited by its then daytime-only license at 980 AM, it started up WPBC-FM at 101.3 MHz in August 1959, simulcasting the AM station. The studios, transmitters (both AM and FM), towers and offices were located at the intersection of Cliff Road and Cedar Avenue (presently \\"Nichols Road\\"), in Eagan. The Stewarts sold the stations in 1972 to Fairchild Industries for $1.5 million. Fairchild subsequently dismissed the entire staff and overhauled both stations. On November 3, 1972, the AM station was relaunched as WYOO, picking up an oldies format (with early rock 'n roll included). A few days later, WPBC-FM became WRAH and programmed an automated Album oriented rock (AOR) format. When the oldies format of WYOO started to slide in the ratings, more middle of the road (MOR) music was added, but ratings slid even further. Fairchild contemplated selling the station. General Manager Mike Sigelman and Program Director Rob Sherwood, both hired from established Top 40 station KDWB, felt a major change needed to be made, and flipped WRAH to Top 40. The new \\"U100\\" debuted on August 26, 1974, during a remote broadcast from the Minnesota State Fair. U100 was not to last forever. The AM dial in the Twin Cities was crowded with top 40 stations, with U-100, KDWB, WDGY and KSTP all fighting for the same audience. AM music stations also desired to transition to the increasingly popular FM dial. In early 1976, Fairchild Industries decided to put both stations on the market. Entertainment Communications, the owner of easy listening FM station WAYL, was interested in the AM station to simulcast WAYL's signal. The FCC rules in place for decades regarding ownership stipulated an owner/entity could not own more than one AM and one FM station (and one TV) in the same market at the time; Fairchild Industries needed to find a buyer for the FM station and sought out the owners of various AM stations in the area. Doubleday Broadcasting, owner of KDWB, wasn't actively seeking an FM station at the time, but offered to buy 101.3 FM in February 1976 after it was offered a rather generous deal that included WYOO-FM and the building in Eagan that housed both stations, for $750,000. KDWB's general manager at the time, Gary Stevens, said that it did not buy WYOO-FM to shut down a competitor, but rather to take advantage of what it saw as a good deal. U100 signed off for the last time at midnight on September 15, 1976, and KDWB Program Director and morning personality Dave Thompson launched the KDWB AM/FM simulcast the following morning at 6:00 with \\"Bad Blood\\" by Neil Sedaka as the first song played following the pre-recorded piece announcing the change. Continuous AM and FM simulcasts in large markets (stations licensed to cities with populations over 100,000) were not allowed by the FCC since 1965. However, KDWB's simulcast was permitted under the terms, conditions and FCC rules of the time via a conditional waiver and a technicality: while the AM was licensed to St. Paul (a community of over 100,000), the FM's city of license (Richfield) did not have that large a population. The FCC deemed the request to be in the public interest; however, KDWB was required by the FCC to broadcast eight hours of separate FM non-simulcast public affairs programming per week, with a portion focused on Richfield (the FM's city of license). The public affairs programs were broadcast from the former WYOO studio B news room and master control board in Eagan. Helped by the stereo simulcast on 101.3 FM, KDWB quickly regained its position as the dominant Top 40 station in the Twin Cities. Their fierce young rival, U100, was now gone. After a brief stint with a CHR/AOR hybrid as \\"Y-11\\", WDGY switched to a country format on September 2, 1977. KSTP began to lean Adult Top 40 during the late 1970s and evolved into a talk station by the early 1980s (as its music focus shifted to FM sister, KS95). By the end of the decade, KDWB was the only ongoing Top 40 station in town. =Stereo 101= With the active competition gone, KDWB-FM split apart from the AM station's Top 40 simulcast in September 1979, and became a pop/rock hybrid as \\"K101 FM\\", with a new separate air-staff. K101 FM was met with mixed reviews and less than hoped for ratings in the Fall 1979 Arbitron ratings. KDWB management opted for a change, between the last week of December 1979 and New Year's 1980, replacing the Program Director. The station immediately morphed into \\"KDWB Stereo 101, The Twin Cities Rockin' Best\\", then \\"KDWB Twin Cities' 101, The Home Of Rock 'N' Roll\\", and then \\"Real Rock 101 KDWB\\", an AOR station designed to go up against KQ92 which had recently dumped its Freeform Rock presentation and adopted a stricter playlist in reaction to a drop in ratings. Stereo 101 would be successful in its four-year run, topping KQRS in the Arbitron ratings many times, but KQRS endured and prevailed. By summer 1983, KDWB-FM began to move from Album Rock to a pop/rock hybrid again. KDWB's AM signal continued with the Top 40 format during this time, although it softened to adult contemporary in 1984. =Back to Top 40= In December 1981, a serious new Top 40 competitor arrived in the Twin Cities, when WLOL dropped its soft rock format and turned itself into a high-profile hit music station (heavy with power pop and new wave), immediately shooting to the top of the ratings. At the other end of the spectrum, KS95 was competing somewhat with its older-leaning soft rock format. Around this time, WCCO-FM also briefly switched to Top 40. Meanwhile, 63 KDWB faded quickly in the ratings, as AM music stations were slowly becoming a thing of the past. To protect its heritage, take a chunk of WLOL's stellar ratings, and finally make the move of its legendary station to the FM dial, in early 1984, KDWB-FM reverted to the Top 40 simulcast as \\"The New KDWB FM 101\\", and then as \\"All Hit 101\\". Even though the AM station was running its own programming at times, in a role reversal, the FM signal was now deemed the priority, as 630 AM attained secondary status. The AM station aired a CHR format identical to its FM counterpart from late 1984 to early 1986, before it flipped to a separate Oldies format as \\"K63\\" in May 1986. In August 1991, 630 AM took on the WDGY call letters of their former Top 40 rival on 1130 AM. KDWB FM struggled for years against upstart market leader WLOL, which featured a fresher music selection, more popular DJs, and a highly rated morning show. KDWB was viewed by many as stuffy, stale, boring and misguided, and it went through several unsuccessful morning shows. It was argued by many that its promotions, music selection and on-air presentation paled in comparison to WLOL. In 1988, newly hired program director Brian Phillips cleaned house, as he dismissed many of the on-air personalities, overhauled the music and brought in Steve Cochran to host The KDWB Morning Zoo. He also hired a new air staff, introduced 12-song commercial-free music sweeps, changed the overall on-air presentation, and created a new logo, which is still in use today. As the rechristened \\"101.3 KDWB\\", its fortunes changed, with KDWB quickly becoming the dominant Top 40/CHR station in the market. Now, WLOL was playing catch-up, as it tried various minor overhauls and tweaks before moving in a Rhythmic-oriented direction in 1990.https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1990/RR-1990-05-18.pdf KDWB also gained national attention in 1989 for helping to break \\"The Look\\" by Roxette, the first of four US number-one songs for the Swedish duo. In February 1991, WLOL came to a sudden and premature end, as owner Emmis Broadcasting experienced financial problems and began to divest of many of its properties. Minnesota Public Radio purchased WLOL and turned it into the flagship for their classical music service. Throughout the rest of the 1990s, KDWB had virtually no CHR competition. In 2000, KDWB got a new rival of sorts when upstart KTTB (\\"B96\\") went on the air with a rhythmic Top 40 format, heavy with hip-hop and urban contemporary music. While B96 was not a major ratings threat, partly due to its rimshot broadcast signal and smaller promotional presence, it did give KDWB the most formidable competition it had in recent years. Today, the competition for the rhythmic/urban audience comes from KZGO, sister station to the former B96. At the other end of the spectrum, KS95 also competes somewhat with its older- leaning Hot AC format (which has since transitioned to a more younger-leaning direction), as does KDWB's own sister station KTCZ, with its own pop/rock- leaning Hot AC presentation. In 2010, KTTB rebranded as KHTC, leaning more towards KDWB's format, and relocated their transmitter to the heart of the metro area. The battle between KDWB and KHTC lasted until New Year's Day 2012, when KHTC flipped to Modern AC to fill the void left open by WLTE's flip to Country, thus leaving KDWB as the market's only mainstream Top 40 outlet again. HD Radio On April 25, 2006, Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia), KDWB's current owners, announced that KDWB's HD2 subchannel will carry a format focusing on dance hits. The HD2 signed the following July as the Party Zone. \\"Party Zone\\" is also the name of the Friday and Saturday night show on KDWB simulcasted from local clubs that in the past has been hosted by the likes of Tone E. Fly, Gerry Dixon and Michael Knight. After six months of running jockless, the subchannel began to add announcers (from KDWB) to its programming. In 2010, the Party Zone format began broadcasting on K273BH, its FM translator at 102.5, which covers the area. They were one of two outlets in the Clear Channel roster that did not use the Club Phusion Dance format, as this one featured a live presentation over the air. The other one is KXJM Portland, Oregon, who launched \\"Too Wild HD2\\" in January 2012, customized for that market. On April 29, 2013, the Party Zone format was dropped in favor of an Adult Contemporary format. In e-mails exchanged with the KDWB programming director, it was discovered that ultimately the station will air \\"songs recorded in Studio C from Cities 97\\", which began on July 15, 2013. In 2017, KDWB-FM HD2 changed to iHeart's \\"Trancid\\" format. In May 2018, the station activated an HD3 sub-channel, and began airing an adult hits format as \\"Minnesota State Fair Radio\\". After KQQL-HD3/K244FE dropped the \\"Pride Radio\\" format and flipped to sports talk as \\"KFAN Plus\\" in August 2018, the \\"Pride Radio\\" format moved to KDWB-HD2. On November 16, 2018, KDWB-HD3 briefly switched to KQQL's classic hits format (while KQQL made its annual flip to Christmas music that same day). However, on November 30, KDWB-HD3 switched to a country format branded as \\"The Bull 101.3-HD3.\\" Gregg Swedberg, program director and operations manager of sister KEEY, says that the \\"Bull\\" format \\"just plays country music, with no pop crossovers\\". In May 2019, KDWB-HD3 reverted to its previous \\"Minnesota State Fair Radio\\" branding and format. Dave Ryan in the Morning The Dave Ryan in the Morning show is KDWB's morning show. It has aired on KDWB since June 11, 1993. Current hosts of the show are Dave Ryan (born October 24, 1962), Falen Bonsett (born April 6, 1984), and Steve \\"Steve-O\\" LaTart (born May 5, 1981). =Former morning show staff= Former morning show staff include: * Lee Valsvik: (1993‚Äì2000) ‚Äî now at sister station Kool 108 in Minneapolis/St. Paul * Angi Taylor: (1998‚Äì2003)- now at sister station 103.5 KISS FM in Chicago * Corey Foley: (2003‚Äì2007) * Lena Svenson (2007‚Äì2011) ‚Äî formerly on the Elvis Duran & the Morning Show in New York (2012-2018), using her real name, Bethany Watson.

The worker is envious of Cory. The advantages and recreations available to Richard Cory are enumerated in the song and the worker openly envies not only these specific advantages but Cory's presumed happiness. The last verse of the song ends similarly to the Robinson poem: Richard Cory went home last night and put a bullet through his head. Whereas the original poem concludes with this closing revelation and its implications, the repetition of the chorus in Simon's version (still pressing an insistent envy following Cory's suicide) discloses a second, darker revelation about what the worker wants.

In this particular version by Wings, during the first chorus line Laine actually (jokingly albeit deliberately) refers to the title character by the name of John Denver rather than Richard Cory, thus inciting a roar of laughter and applause from the audience, as this was apparently an unexpected modification on the original theme of the song. The song has also been covered by Van Morrison (and with his band, Them), The Watchmen, The Heptones, Angst, The Back Porch Majority, Yami Bolo, Cuby & the Blizzards, Chicago Loop and Martini Ranch.

Compilers A retargetable compiler is a compiler that has been designed to be relatively easy to modify to generate code for different CPU instruction set architectures. The history of this idea dates back to the 1950s when UNCOL was proposed as the universal intermediate language. The Pascal P-compiler is an example of an early widely used retargetable compiler. The cost of producing a retargetable compiler that generates code of similar quality to a non-retargetable compiler (i.e., one designed to only ever produce code for a single processor) is higher because it is not possible to make use of cpu specific details throughout all phases of compilation. The benefits of a retargetable compiler is that the total cost over multiple CPUs is much lower than the combined cost of many individual non-targetable compilers. Some retargetable compilers, e.g., GCC, become so widely ported and developed that they now include support for many optimizations and machine specific details that the quality of code often surpasses that of non-retargetable compilers on many CPUs. A general-purpose global optimizer followed by machine-specific peephole optimization is a commonly used implementation technique.Davidson and Fraser; The Design and Application of a Retargetable Peephole Optimizer; ToPLaS v2(2) 191-202 (April 1980) The optimization of code for some high performance processors requires a detailed and specific knowledge of the architecture and how the instructions are executed. Unless developers invest the large amount of time necessary to write a code generator specifically for an architecture, the optimizations performed by a retargetable compiler will only be those applicable to generic processor characteristics. A retargetable compiler is a kind of cross compiler. Often (but not always) a retargetable compiler is portable (the compiler itself can run on several different CPUs) and self-hosting. Examples of retargetable compilers: *GCC *ACK *lcc *VBCC *Portable C Compiler *SDCC *LLVM * The Small-C compiler * MPG, the \\"machine-independent efficient microprogram generator\\" Rainer Leupers, Peter Marwedel. \\"Retargetable Compiler Technology for Embedded Systems\\". 2001\\\\. () p. 63. Decompiler retdec: is an open source retargetable machine-code decompiler based on LLVM. * The decompiler is not limited to any particular target architecture, operating system, or executable file format: * Supported file formats: ELF, PE, Mach-O, COFF, AR (archive), Intel HEX, and raw machine code. * Supported architectures (currently 32bit only): Intel x86, ARM, MIPS, PIC32, and PowerPC. Assemblers Conversely, retargetable assemblers are capable of generating object files of different formats, which is useful in porting assembly language programs to various operating systems that run on the same CPU architecture (such as Windows and Linux on the x86 platform). NASM is one such assembler.

Immigrants have moved from the territory of the Dominican Republic to its eastern neighbor, Puerto Rico, and vice versa for centuries. Dominican immigrants have come from various segments of Dominican society, with varying levels of contribution at different times. In recent years, the rate of Dominican immigration has declined due to the unemployment and economic crisis in Puerto Rico, and there's been increasing immigration in the opposite direction, from Puerto Rico to the Dominican Republic, consisting of both Dominicans returning from Puerto Rico as well as ethnic Puerto Ricans settling in the Dominican Republic.bigstory.ap.org/article/25dfa7db079241eab2f8ab58122aef7a/dominican- economy-lures-puerto-ricans-crisis Haitian nationals now make the majority of persons trying to reach the commonwealth nation from the island of Hispaniola, usually with the aid of Dominican smugglers. Despite, the decline in popularity for Dominicans overall, due to the increasing xenophobia in the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico is still a popular destination among people of Haitian ancestry who are living either legally or illegally in the Dominican Republic and don't want to get deported back to Haiti. 1795 to 1961 Many residents of Colonial Santo Domingo, now the Dominican Republic, left for Puerto Rico because of the cession of Santo Domingo to France in 1795, the Haitian invasions from 1801 to 1803, and the occupation from 1822 to 1844. Immigration continued over the next 86 years although at a comparatively low rate. The dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo from 1930 to 1961 greatly constrained foreign travel by Dominicans. In 1960, there were 1,812 Dominicans in Puerto Rico, some of whom were \\"returning\\" descendants of Puerto Ricans who had themselves migrated to the Dominican Republic. Historically, there has been very high migration between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, not only during the Taino era, but also during the Spanish colonial era up until modern times. It was very, very common, due to similar cultures, for newcomers to intermarry and assimilate easily into the local culture. It is estimated that significant portions of both islands have some distant ancestry from the other island due to the constant flow between both islands especially in the 18th to mid 20th centuries. Recently Dominican migration increased sharply after 1961 as a result of political events, of which the first was the assassination of Trujillo that year. Many politicians and other members of the conservative former regime, as well as government employees, left the country, many of them for Puerto Rico. The next major political event to drive emigration was the coup d'√©tat against the elected, leftist president Juan Bosch in 1963. Then followed the Dominican Civil War in 1965 after a revolt to restore Bosch. The United States invaded the Dominican Republic a few days into the conflict, and one of its policies was to prevent renewed civil war by issuing visas to opponents or potential opponents of the newly elected US- backed conservative regime of Joaqu√≠n Balaguer (who was incidentally, like Bosch, of Puerto Rican ancestry). Many of the visaholders traveled to Puerto Rico. Politics continued to play a role in emigration in succeeding decades, as presidential election years produced emigration peaks whenever Balaguer, a member of the former Trujillo regime, won the presidency, as happened in 1966, 1970, 1974, 1986, and 1990. As a result, most of the Dominican emigration was middle-class and skilled, including many managers and professionals. Although there are substantial upper class and middle class segments in the Dominican Republic, the country also has a high poverty rate. Since the 1970s, the poor economy of the Dominican Republic has rampantly driven emigration. Overall, between 1966 and 2002 119,000 Dominicans were legally admitted to Puerto Rico, while many thousands arrived illegally. Most emigrants, however, are far from destitute, as they tend to be jobholders in the Dominican Republic, many in skilled occupations such as mechanic, mason, seamstress, and nurse. Such migrants have been attracted by the economy of Puerto Rico's higher wages, which have generally tended to rise in relation to Dominican wages since the early 1980s, when an era of frequent devaluation of the Dominican peso began. Economic crises that beset the Dominican Republic in the 1980s further increased emigration. Despite strong economic growth, the 1990s marked the peak in Dominican emigration because of the high income inequality. Another severe economic crisis hit in 2003 to 2004, again causing a surge in emigration. The height of modern-day Dominican immigration to Puerto Rico was from 1970 to about 2005, when the Puerto Rican economy started to decline, since then its been slowly dying down, with increasing immigration the opposite direction, Puerto Ricans moving to the Dominican Republic. Though, many Dominicans who moved to Puerto Rico, stayed and started a life there, some Dominicans (and even other Latinos/Caribbeans like Haitians and Cubans) used it as a temporary stop-over point to the US mainland, particularly to cities like New York and Miami. Although, 2010 census estimates put the number of Dominicans living in Puerto Rico at 68,000, there are estimates that put the number as high as 300,000, with many undocumented. Some Dominican criminals take advantage of Puerto Rico's territory status, by doing crimes such as Identity theft of Puerto Rican US citizens, and drug distribution working with Puerto Rican criminals to ship Colombian drugs to the island and then further be shipped to the US mainland. However, the vast majority of Dominicans come for a better life, to start a business, and live a positive lifestyle. Illegal immigration Abandoned yola in the coast of Aguadilla, Puerto Rico The illegal or undocumented component of the Dominican immigration to Puerto Rico has increased over recent decades, becoming large enough to attract great attention, both in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. The first recorded illegal trip took place in 1972, and perhaps 28% of all Dominicans in Puerto Rico were undocumented in 1996, during the peak decade of Dominican immigration to the Commonwealth; many of the documented residents had regularized their originally undocumented status. Illegal immigration has been one of the most recurrent themes in Puerto Rican news media during the first decade of the 21st century. Illegal trips usually take place in yolas (small wooden boats), usually overcrowded, as trip planners and boat captains seek to realize the greatest profit from the ventures. A trip on a yola takes 26‚Äì28 hours and takes place over the Puerto Rico Trench (an underwater crater area) or through the Mona Passage. Accounts by survivors include people being either eaten alive by sharks or forced to jump into the sea when there is a danger of sinking. Others tell of seeing their loved ones left behind to drown after a heavy wave has overturned one of these yolas, and many others tell of corpses left on board. Travelers sometimes die of starvation or dehydration since the yolas can get lost out at sea for days, and many have no type of navigation equipment on board to steer them in the right direction. Coast Guard Cutter Escanaba (WMEC-907) interdicted this 30-foot yola with 28 migrants on board in the Mona Passage on May 21, 2019. The overloaded vessel has a pronounced list towards starboard, emphasizing the dangerous nature of these voyages. Noted tragedies on such trips include a 1989 sinking near Mona Island where as many as 500 perished, and other, comparatively small tragedies where groups of 30 or more passengers have died. Perhaps the most famous of these tragic trips was the Nagua Tragedy, named so because the yola heading to Puerto Rico that time sunk while trying to make its way out of a beach in Nagua. More than one hundred died, including the boat's captain and the trip planner. In November 2008, a group of 33 illegal Dominican migrants who were en route to Puerto Rico were forced to resort to cannibalism after they were lost at sea for over 15 days before being rescued by a U.S. Coast Guard patrol boat.Dominican migrant: We ate flesh to survive - A small group turned to cannibalism after being stranded in mid-ocean, NBC News, November 4, 2008 Not all illegal trips to Puerto Rico from the Dominican Republic end in tragedy. These trips are massively scheduled by traffickers, who sometimes travel up to three times each week from Puerto Rico to illegally bring Dominicans. But, because of the large amount of lives that have been lost in many of these trips, both the governments of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic have launched mass media campaigns to try to reduce them. In the Dominican Republic, videos of dead bodies on the water are shown on television to try to deter people from travelling to Puerto Rico on yolas. The traffickers face long periods in jail if caught, whereas the travelers are deported to the Dominican Republic, where they do not face criminal charges. In 2009 an order was given by Governor Luis Fortu√±o to shut off essential services, such as water and electricity, to Villas del Sol, a shantytown within the municipality of Toa Baja. The shantytown consisted mainly of homes built illegally on flood-prone government-owned land. The Federal Emergency Management Agency bought these homes from the Puerto Rican Government in order to keep them from being used further. In January 2010 the island government began demolishing some of the homes whose residents are both U.S. citizens and undocumented aliens, mainly of Dominican origin. Current circumstances Dominicans in Puerto Rico are largely disadvantaged politically, in great part because so many are not citizens. They are also disadvantaged economically, and possess on average much lower levels of education than the mainstream of Puerto Ricans on the island. That is in contrast to their situation in the 1970s, when a demographic study considered Dominican immigrants to be \\"privileged\\" and an \\"elite,\\" as a large percentage of Dominican immigrants were professionals and managers. Their present characteristics have made them easy victims for ethnic discrimination, which include accusations of excessive use of government programs. They are often targets of prejudice and racism as well. In response, dozens of organizations have sprouted to increase the group's political participation, although these efforts' full effectiveness is hampered by inadequate coordination. The group is not ignored by Dominican politicians, however. The main Dominican parties campaign in Puerto Rico during presidential elections and raise important amounts of funds from the Dominican residents. Dominicans in Puerto Rico send millions of dollars per month to their relatives in the Dominican Republic, and are thus also important as a source of foreign currency for the D.R. The 2010 census estimated a population of 68,036 Dominicans in Puerto Rico, equal to 1.8% of the Commonwealth's population. Majority of Dominicans in Puerto Rico live in the San Juan area, chiefly the cities of San Juan, Bayam√≥n, and Carolina. Data from the 2000 census shows that 55% of this group lived in San Juan municipality, 11% in Carolina, and 7% in Bayam√≥n. San Juan is about 9% Dominican, with a moderate concentration in the Rio Piedras district, in the southern part of the municipality. Smaller numbers of Dominicans settle the west coast (around Mayag√ºez) of Puerto Rico due to proximity to Hispaniola, and the northeast portion of the island (around Lo√≠za) some finding it easier to integrate among the more African-descended Puerto Ricans. Majority of the Dominicans living in Puerto Rico have origins in the eastern portions of the Dominican Republic, including cities like San Pedro de Macor√≠s, La Romana, Hig√ºey, Nagua, as well as some coming from larger cities like Santo Domingo and Santiago de los Caballeros. The vast majority of Dominican immigrants in Puerto Rico, are black or mulatto/mixed, with very few Dominicans in Puerto Rico self-identifying as white, considerably lower white percentages than the Dominican Republic itself and the Dominican origin population in the US mainland, as the eastern portion of the country is more African descended than other parts of the Dominican Republic. Women form a fairly large majority of the Dominicans in Puerto Rico. Family creation and intermarriage rates with Puerto Ricans are also high. Although the Dominican community has largely assimilated into the mainstream Puerto Rican population, due to very similar culture, they still retain traditions that uniquely Dominican. About 67% of Dominicans in Puerto Rico are legal citizens. Economically, Dominicans contribute most as unskilled and low-paid service workers, as operators, laborers and craftspeople, and they are well represented as small business owners. Their ratio of managers and professionals ‚Äî 24% in 1970, higher than for mainstream Puerto Ricans at that time ‚Äî is now much lower. However, Dominicans are employed in all occupations and industrial sectors of Puerto Rico's economy. Many members of the group have attained prominence and fame as entertainers, including musicians, singers, actors, and presenters.

Airport Auth. v. Evans, 191 So. 2d 126, 128 (Miss. 1966) (transcribing doctrine as \\"ad inferos\\"); Samantha J. Hepburn, Ownership Models for Geological Sequestration: A Comparison of the Emergent Regulatory Models in Australia & the United States, 44 10310, 10313 (2014) (translating phrase as \\"whoever owns [the] soil, [it] is theirs all the way [up] to Heaven and [down] to Hell\\") (internal quotation marks omitted) is a principle of property law, stating that property holders have rights to not only to the plot of land itself, but also the air above and (in the broader formulation) the ground below. The principle is often referred to in its abbreviated form as the ad coelum doctrine.Hinman v. Pac. Air Lines Transp. Corp., 84 F.2d 755, 757 (9th Cir. 1936) (noting that \\"the ad coelum doctrine does not apply in California\\") In modern law, this principle is still accepted in limited form, and the rights are divided into air rights above and subsurface rights below. Property title includes to the space immediately above and below the ground ‚Äì preventing overhanging parts of neighboring buildings ‚Äì but do not have rights to control flights far above the ground or in space. In dense urban areas, air rights may be transferable (see transferable development rights) to allow construction of new buildings over existing buildings. Early versions of the maxim have been traced to the 13th- century Italian jurist Accursius, and is said to date in common law to the time of Edward I. It was more recently promulgated, in broad form (air above and ground below) by William Blackstone in his influential treatise Commentaries on the Laws of England (1766).  Applications  As the name describes, the principle is that a person who owns a particular piece of land owns everything above and below it as well. Consequently, the owner could prosecute trespass against people who violated the border but never actually touched the soil. As with any other property rights, the owner can sell or lease it to others, or it may be taken or regulated by the state. For example, suppose three people owned neighboring plots of land. The owners of the plots on the ends want to build a bridge over the center plot connecting their two properties. Even though the bridge would never touch the soil of the owner in the middle, the principle of cuius est solum would allow the middle owner to stop its construction or demand payment for the right to do so. By the same principle, a person who wants to mine under somebody's land would have to get permission from the owner to do so, even if the mine entrance was on neighboring land. Origins The phrase is credited to the glossator Accursius in the 13th Century.Harvard Legal Essays, Written in Honor of and Presented to John Henry Beale and Samuel Williston, 1977, Ayer Company Publishers, Incorporated, p. 522, note 8: \\"He who owns the soil owns it up to the sky.\\" The maxim had no place in the Roman law during its classical period, but is said to have been first used by Accursius of Bologna, a commentator, who flourished in the thirteenth century. It has been suggested that the maxim was introduced into England by the son of Accursius whom Edward I brought with him on his return from the Holy Land and who for many years held high office under the Crown and also was connected with Oxford University. Bouv√©, Private Ownership of Airspace, 1 Air Law Rev. 232, 246‚Äì248. At any rate, nearly three centuries later the reporter's note to Bury v. Pope, Cro. Eliz. 118 [78 Eng. Rep. 375] (1587) ascribes the maxim to the time of Edward I.\\"Clement Lincoln Bouv√©, \\"Private Ownership of Airspace\\", 1 Air Law Rev. 232, 376 (1930), 246‚Äì248AERONAUTICS: Sky the Limit?, TIME, August 4, 1930‚ÄúA colourful phrase often upon the lips of lawyers since it was first coined by Accursius in Bologna in the 13th century‚Äù, Justice Griffiths, in Baron Bernstein of Leigh v Skyviews and General Ltd [1978] QB 479, quoted in \\"Max Headroom: Ownership Of Airspace ‚Äì Can You Reach For The Stars?\\", Digging the Dirt, Jon Dickins, Monday, 28 February 2011Wilkie, Malcolm & Luxton: Q&A;: Land Law 2011 and 2012, Oxford University Press, Chapter 2: Definition of Land , p. 5, \\"Question 1:Cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos (the owner of the land owns everything up to the sky and down to the centre of the earth). ‚Ä¶ Suggested Answer: This maxim, which was coined by Accursius in the thirteenth century, relates to the extent of the ownership enjoyed by the fee simple owner.\\" It has been suggested that the principle was brought to England by Accursius's son, Franciscus Accursius, who came to England with Edward I on the latter's return from the crusades. The principle was firmly established in common law by Edward Coke in Bury v. Pope (1587),Bury v. Pope, Cro. Eliz. 118 [78 Eng. Rep. 375] (1587), reporter's note which gives the first statement in English law of the principle, writing (Liber 1, section 1, page 4, section \\"Terra\\" (earth)):(See detailed case history here) SWETLAND v. CURTISS AIRPORTS CORPORATION, 41 F.2d 929 (1930), District Court, N. D. Ohio, E. D., July 7, 1930, p. 5‚Äì7 (41 F.2d 934 & 935) The reporter's note to this case ascribes the maxim to the time of Edward I, which accords with the attribution to Accursius (father and son). Two other cases around 1600 also use the principle, and a number of 19th century cases also apply it. The phrase appears in Blackstone's Commentaries, Book 2, Chapter 2, p. *18: This formulation, though it omits the et ad inferos \\"and to hell\\" wording, includes that interpretation (\\"and the center of the earth\\"). Largely through the influence of Blackstone, this broader formulation became influential in American law.John G. Sprankling, Owning the Center of the Earth, 55 UCLA L. Rev. 979, 982-83 (2008). See Sweeney reference for various formulations of the principle in Anglo-American law.Edward C. Sweeney, \\"Adjusting the Conflicting Interests of Landowner and Aviator in Anglo-American Law,\\" 3 Journal of Air Law and Commerce (1932), 355‚Äì373. (Cited in Schick, footnote 1) The principle does not occur in classical Roman law. The phrase was used by Accursius in discussion of rights to have burial plots or tombs free from the interference of an overhanging building. In Coke's formulation, he cites three cases involving birds; the circa 1600 cases involve overhanging roofs, while the 19th century cases address diverse topics. The principle attracted increased interest with the development of air and space travel occasioning much discussion, particularly in the 1930s, and the development of space travel yielding further review of the ad coelum doctrine in the 1960s. In American law, the formulation Ab orco usque ad coelum \\"from Hades all the way to Heaven\\"ab and ad mean \\"from\\" and \\"to\\", and are common Latin words; orco, from the Italian underworld god Orcus, refers poetically to the underworld, coelum means \\"sky, heaven\\", and usque means \\"continuously, without break\\" by Louis Brandeis is also found. Modern history The steadfast ad coelum doctrine of property began to fall into disfavor with the advent of air and space travel:Huebert, Jacob H. (2011-04-18) Who Owns the Sky?, Mises Institute > After the first hot-air balloon flight in 1783, people began to realize that > strict ad coelum would undermine all air travel.

Within the United States, the end of the indefinitely upward interpretation of the ad coelum doctrine came from a well-reasoned United States Supreme Court case United States v. Causby in 1946.United States v. Causby, In the Causby case: The Causby case rejected the notion that property ownership extended upward 'indefinitely', while still recognizing a landowner retains complete domain over the lower altitudes above their property. The court noted that ad coelum \\"had no meaning in the modern world\\", while also holding that \\"if the landowner is to have full enjoyment of the land, he must have exclusive control of the immediate reaches of the enveloping atmosphere. Otherwise buildings could not be erected, trees could not be planted, and even fences could not be run\\" ...\\"The fact that he does not occupy [the space] in a physical sense -- by the erection of buildings and the like -- is not material. As we have said, the flight of airplanes, which skim the surface but do not touch it, is as much an appropriation of the use of the land as a more conventional entry upon it.‚Äù id 264 . On remand, the Court of Claims established the landowner's property extends upward to only 365 feet, but not above. see Causby v U.S. court of claims (1948). With the advent of space exploration, the upper limits to the \\"ad coelum\\" doctrine now include issues of national sovereignty. Strong arguments can be made for and against the altitude at which national sovereignty ceases and the rights of orbit or travel start. In particular, the making of national territorial claims in outer space and on celestial bodies has been specifically proscribed by the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which was, , ultimately ratified by all space-faring nations. Article II of the treaty notes that \\"Outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation.\\" The \\"ad coelum\\" doctrine-that property or sovereignty extends indefinable upward-is no longer accepted without limitations. This is not surprising since any claim to space based on national boundaries is based upon points defined on the surface of a rotating planet and therefore must have an upper boundary. The \\"ad infernum\\" theory positing property ownership \\"to the center of the Earth\\" has also been eroded. A review of modern American jurisprudence demonstrates that the theory is more poetic hyperbole than binding law, and that broadly speaking, the deeper the disputed region, the less likely courts are to recognize that the surface owner holds subsurface title. Appraisal studies of subsurface projects such as subways, deep storm drainage tunnels, and particle colliders consistently conclude that such projects, built well below the area that the vast majority of surface property owners ever put to use, do not deprive the surface owners of any value.

After the war, he served as a Democrat in both the United States House of Representatives and then the United States Senate from Virginia. Early years Hunton was born on September 22, 1822 near Warrenton, Virginia, to Eppa Hunton Sr. (1789-1830) and the former Elizabeth Marye Brent (1789-1866), who had married on June 22, 1811, in Fauquier County. He was their third son, after the twins John Heath Hunton and George William Hunton, who were born in 1812. Both families had emigrated from England by about 1700. His father taught school and operated three plantations: \\"Springfield\\" and \\"Mount Hope\\" in Fauquier County (whose seat was Warrenton, though the plantations were near New Baltimore) and another in nearby Prince William County. The senior Eppa Hunton had fought in the War of 1812 (rising to brigade inspector of Virginia's militia) and twice won election to the Virginia House of Delegates, but died unexpectedly young in Lancaster in Virginia's Northern Neck in 1830. This left his widow to raise nine young children (two others having died as infants), and the Prince William plantation was sold to pay debts. His mother's father, William Brent, was a lawyer who had fought in the American Revolutionary War, and had moved his family from the port of Dumfries in Prince William County to Bealeton in Fauquier County for safekeeping during that war. The Prince William county seat, Brentsville (near the county's center), was named for that family. This Eppa Hunton was educated at the private New Baltimore Academy by Rev. John Ogilvie, although family circumstances forced him to borrow money to finish his final year in 1839.Autobiography pp. 3-5 Early career After graduating from that school, this Eppa Hunton taught for three years, first in a log schoolhouse near The Plains in Fauquier County. Then he opened his own school in Buckland in Prince William County, where he lived with his brother Silas and his wife. Hunton taught the five sons of John Webb Tyler, who in turn helped him to study law and become admitted to the Virginia bar in 1843. Hunton thus began his legal practice in Brentsville, the Prince William County seat. He also became prominent in the local community, winning election as colonel, and later brigadier general, in the Virginia militia. After Virginia's legislature elected J.W. Tyler as circuit judge, Hunton was elected his successor as Commonwealth's attorney (local prosecutor) in 1848. Voters re-elected him twice, so he served from 1849-1861.Autobiography pp. 6-7 In 1850, this Eppa Hunton, at age 30, owned 6 enslaved people: a 30 year old black female and five children (a 14 year old mulatto female, 5 and 10 year old black boys, and three year and 5 month old black girls).1850 U.S. Federal Census for Prince William County, Virginia, slave schedule, available at ancestry.com Hunton later described himself as a Democrat from his \\"earliest youth\\" like his father, and he was one of Virginia's delegates to the Democratic National Convention in 1856, and was a Breckenridge elector in 1860, later describing the multiple conventions that year that divided the Democratic party.Autobiography pp. 9-10 Family life On 1848, this Eppa Hunton married Lucy Caroline Weir (February 20, 1825 - September 4, 1899), daughter of Robert and Clara Boothe Weir. Her family could trace their ancestry to Judge Benjamin Waller of Williamsburg, and her father had been a successful merchant in Tappahannock before moving to Prince William County and running a plantation called \\"Hartford\\" until he died in 1840, leaving his widow with young children. During the April after Lucy's marriage to Eppa Hunton, Mrs. Weir and sold \\"Hartford\\" and moved with her daughters Betty and Martha to the new home Hunton had purchased in Brentsville. There she lived with the young family until Union soldiers destroyed the home in 1862. Mrs. Weir would continue to live with the Huntons until her death in Warrenville in 1870, and Martha until her death in 1882, although Bettie would move in with relatives in Clarke County after Lucy's death.Autobiography pp. 7-8 The Huntons had two children: :*Elizabeth Boothe Hunton (June 20, 1853 - September 30, 1854) :*Eppa Hunton III (April 14, 1855 - March 5, 1932), who became his father's law partner, and went on to co-found the notable Richmond law firm Hunton & Williams in 1901. Considerably after the Civil War described below, Hunton's brother James died, and Eppa Hunton provided for his children, especially Bessie Marye Hunton (named after their mother), paying for her education and ultimately blessing her marriage. Civil War Brig. Gen. Eppa Hunton. In February 1861, Prince William County voters elected Hunton, an avowed secessionist, as their delegate to the Virginia Secession Convention, as he handily defeated a Unionist candidate, Allen Howison.Autobiography p. 11 At the Convention Hunton made many contacts which proved important later in his career, from former U.S. President John Tyler, to Governor John Letcher, Lt. Gov. Montague, and former Navy Secretary Ballard Preston. With the outbreak of the American Civil War, Hunton relinquished his militia commission and secured a commission as colonel of the 8th Virginia Infantry, Confederate States Army, composed of seven companies from Loudoun County, two from Fauquier County and one each from Fairfax County and Prince William County. Initially, Charles B. Tebbs was his Lt.Col. and Norborne Berkeley as the regimental Major.Autobiography p. 235 (App. I) The regiment (then of eight companies) was assigned to guard the Potomac River in Loudoun County, along with the Loudoun Cavalry and a Loudoun artillery regiment. During the First Battle of Bull Run on July 21, 1861, Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard cited its gallantry coming off reserve status in his summary of the Confederate victory. It was then again assigned to protect Leesburg, Virginia, the seat of Loudoun county and an important crossroads for trade across the Potomac River as well as across the Blue Ridge Mountains. Although General Beauregard refused to let Col. Hunton take leave to visit his sick wife five miles from that battlefield, Hunton received several leaves from duty during the war due to a fistula which failed to heal, despite various surgeries, until he became a prisoner of war during the war's final days.Autobiography pp. 42, 46 In October his regiment was part of Nathan G. Evans' brigade near Leesburg, where the temporarily recovered Hunton led his command against a Union force at Ball's Bluff, driving it into the Potomac River. Captains William N. Berkeley and Edmond Berkeley were also cited for their enthusiasm, and for his initiative in capturing about 325 Union prisoners local farmer E.V. White (a/k/a Lige White) would soon be promoted to captain (and ultimately to colonel).Autobiography pp. 46‚Äì59, 242 (App. I) In 1862 the regiment left the Centreville area to oppose the Union's Peninsular Campaign. With the confederate evacuation of Northern Virginia Huntons hometown got under union occupation and he had to evacuate his family through Charlottesville to Lynchburg. Despite still suffering from fistula Hunton returned from sick leave to command his regiment from the withdrawal under Yorktown to defend Richmond. Hunton missed both the Battle of Williamsburg and the Battle of Seven Pines due to sickness. Anticipating the Seven Days Battles he disregarded his physician's advise and returned to the army to fight at the Battle of Frazier's Farm and Battle of Gaines' Mill (which Hunton later cited as the unit's most gallant charge).Autobiography pp. 64‚Äì74 On August 21, 1862, the regiment fought at the Second Battle of Bull Run. Hunton's regiment then crossed the Potomac River and as he again returned to duty fought at the South Mountain and the bloody Antietam.Autobiography pp. 75‚Äì82 After retreating to Virginia, it returned to fight on December 13 at the Battle of Fredericksburg and again the following month, under the command of General Richard B. Garnett, although it would miss the Battle of Chancellorville because it was assigned to secure supplies in North Carolina.Autobiography pp. 83‚Äì85 Promoted to brigade command late because of his ongoing health issues, Hunton was assigned to Lt. Gen. James Longstreet's corps, Maj. Gen. George Pickett's division, and the Army of Northern Virginia. In August 1863, Hunton formally received a promotion to brigadier general, based on his valor during the Battle of Gettysburg, particularly during Pickett's Charge in which Hunton received a leg wound. Because of his promotion, Norborne Berkeley was promoted to command the 8th Virginia, and his brother Edmund became the Lieut. Colonel, his brother William Berkeley, Major, and Charles Berkeley became the senior Captain of what then became known as the \\"Berkeley Regiment.\\" After service in the defenses of Richmond in 1864 including the Battle of Malvern Hill, Gen. Hunton rejoined Pickett's division and fought at Cold Harbor and once again defended Richmond and Petersburg siege lines. In March 1865 his command (by then reduced to 1500 men) fought a delaying action at Five Forks, which turned into a rout. As April 1865 began, Hunton's brigade was again forced to retreat, and skirmished at the Battle of Sayler's Creek. Hunton surrendered his troops to Union forces (a staff officer of future Gen. George Armstrong Custer) after that skirmish, on April 6, 1865, so he missed General Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House three days later. He and other former Confederate officers alternately took ambulances and marched to City Point, then Petersburg, then Washington, D.C. He and a dozen other former senior officers were in New Jersey en route to Massachusetts when they learned of President Lincoln's assassination and noted the Union officers refused to succumb to mob cried of \\"hang them\\" at every station, although he also took umbrage at his companion General Ewell's proposed resolution of the prisoners denying any complicity in the assassination. Hunton recovered his health as a prisoner of war at Fort Warren (Massachusetts), especially noting the professionalism of its commanding officer, a career officer from North Carolina named Wilson, and two local families. He was paroled on July 24. While a prisoner of war, Hunton thought of his lawbooks, as well as worried that his wife and children were penniless in Lynchburg, especially since he had invested all his savings in now-worthless Virginia State Bonds. He learned they refused money offered them by a staff officer of Federal Major John W. Turner (against whom Hunton had fought for many months and found chivalrous), but managed to secure a $50 loan from family friend John H. Reid, then survived on that money until Hunton's pbrother Silas managed to get to Lynchburg and escorted them to Culpeper, where they stayed with the family of Hunton's sister Elizabeth and brother in law, Lt. Morehead (who had distinguished himself at the Battle of Ball's Bluff).Autobiography pp. 123-139 Post-war politics After the war Hunton resumed his former law practice in northern Virginia, initially in Prince William County as well as Fauquier and Loudoun, but by year's end moved his family to Warrenton, where he bought a house in 1867. He later noted that two servant girls (one of whom he had bought so she would not be sold away from her family) had accompanied his wife and family to and from Lynchburg, so that after returning from prison, he told them they were free, and paid their stage fare from Clarke County to their family in Alexandria.Autobiography p. 142 As Hunton's career restarted, he also returned to politics, opposing Congressional Reconstruction and particularly disabilities which the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1868 sought to place on former Confederates. The Constitutional Convention was necessary because Virginia's state constitution of 1850 explicitly endorsed slavery, and the constitutional convention during the American Civil War only had representatives from Union-occupied portions of the Commonwealth and was generally disregarded. Based on negotiations with the newly elected President, Ulysses S. Grant and successive military governors responsible for Virginia, the election to ratify the new state constitution separately considered the document (which was overwhelmingly ratified by voters) and the disabilities on former Confederates (which were narrowly defeated). Hunton thought the Freedman's Bureau created problems, and that he got along well with Gen. John Schofield, the governor of military district No. 1, as well as the local military judge Lysander Hill.Autobiography pp. 147-149 Hunton was also nominated for the state senate for Fauquier and Rappahannock counties after the war, and may have been elected after the war, but unable to take his seat.Autobiography p. 150 With his disability removed by Presidential pardon, Hunton was elected as a Democrat from Virginia in November 1872, and served in the 43rd and the three succeeding Congresses (March 4, 1873 - March 4, 1881). He defeated Republican Edward Daniels, a former abolitionist from Massachusetts who had moved into Gunston Hall and who later would become a Democrat.Autobiography p. 151-152 During his years as a Representative, Hunton served on the Committee on Military Affairs and voted to exonerate Gen. Custer, who had been kind to him. He noted the \\"Democratic wave\\" in the 1874 election, and that while Virginia only sent one other Democrat in 1872, he had seven democratic colleagues in the state delegation in 1874. Hunton became chairman of the Committee on Revolutionary Pensions (44th Congress). In the 46th Congress, he became chairman of the Committee on the District of Columbia(although he was disappointed at his removal from the House Judiciary Committee by the new Speaker in the 45th Congress, whom he had supported), and worked across the aisle with Joseph C.S. Blackburn of Kentucky to improve governance of the federal city, both securing passage of a new 3-commissioner system as well as payment of tax arrearages by corporations and others seeking favors from his committee. Hunton was also appointed to lead a committee investigating allegations of corruption involving former Speaker James Blaine, but the controversial investigation ended after Blaine secured possession of some incriminating letters, and soon was elected to the U.S. Senate, thus giving up his House seat and removing the committee's jurisdiction, although the scandal probably lost Blaine his chance for his party's presidential nomination in 1876, which went to Rutherford B. Hayes instead. Meanwhile, Hunton was the only southerner appointed to the 15-member Electoral Commission created by an act of Congress in 1877 to decide the contests in various states in the presidential election of 1876.http://madnessmike.blogspot.com/2007/11/general-eppa-hunton-another- forgotten.html In 1876, Hunton easily defeated Republican J.C. O'Neal, and after a primary challenge by S. Chapman Neale of Alexandria, handily defeated both Republican Mr. Cochran of Culpeper and Greenback Democrat Capt. John R. Carter (his former subordinate, from Loudoun) in 1878. However, he announced that would be his final term in Congress, and declined renomination in 1880, instead resuming his private legal practice, perhaps in part because he was supporting the family of his brother James, who had died in 1877 (including paying for the education of his niece Bessie Marye Hunton) and his son Eppa Hunton Jr. also graduated from the University of Virginia and his father brought him into the legal practice. In addition to practicing with his son in northern Virginia, he established a partnership with Jeff Chandler in Washington, which flourished until Chandler moved to St. Louis. Railroad executive John S. Barbour Jr. (whose brother James Barbour of Culpeper had lost to Hunton in the 1874 election as an independent with Mosby's support) succeeded him. John Barbour Jr. served three terms, then won election as Virginia's U.S. Senator, but died after three years in office. On May 28, 1892, Hunton was appointed to fill Barbour's senate seat, and won the subsequently election to fill that vacancy, serving until March 4, 1895. During his term, he was chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee to Establish a University of the United States (1893-1895). However, he was deeply disappointed in President Grover Cleveland, who although a fellow Democrat, undercut and divided the party concerning the tariff, free silver, and other issues. On or about April 1, 1894, Hunton became indirectly involved in voting bribery attempts. Charles W. Buttz, a lobbyist and claim agent originally from North Dakota, but living in Washington, D.C. at the time, went to Hunton's house in Warrenton during the Senator's absence. Buttz told Hunton's son, Eppa III, that he would pay him a contingent fee of $25,000 if he would, by presenting arguments as to the pending tariff bill, induce his father to vote against it. Excerpts from the Senate investigating committee on this issue follow: > This offer was declined at once and peremptorily by Eppa Hunton [III], as > set forth in his testimony, and the whole matter was communicated by him to > his father. Senator Hunton availed himself of the first opportunity to > disclose the matter to certain of his friends in the senate, as appears in > the testimony, and was in no other way connected with the transaction. Buttz also attempted to bribe South Dakota Senator James Henderson Kyle to vote against the same bill. Hunton and Kyle were eventually exonerated from all blame. Hunton remained active in the United Confederate Veterans in his later years. In 1895, the 8th Virginia Regiment held its first reunion at Ball's Bluff, site of one of their triumphs, and Hunton addressed them. In 1902, Virginia judge James Keith presented a portrait of Hunton to the Lee Camp of the UCV in Richmond.his remarks are Appendix III of Hunton's Autobiography Death and legacy Afterward, Hunton again resumed his law practice in Warrenton, Virginia. However, after his wife's death, and his son's remarriage to his first wife's sister, Virginia Payne, he decided better opportunities awaited his son in Richmond, particularly after the younger Eppa Hunton's participation at the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1902. This Eppa Hunton sold his Warrenton house and gave his son the proceeds to buy a home in Richmond. Hunton wrapped up his final cases from Washington, D.C., wrote his autobiography and lived the rest of his days with the growing young family at 8 Franklin Street in Richmond, grateful that a Richmond doctor had cured his vertigo, unlike the smaller town's doctors. On October 11, 1908, blind and deaf though previously vigorous, Hunton died at his son's home. He was buried in the city's Hollywood Cemetery with his wife Clara and many fellow Confederate veterans.Autobiography pp. 232-235. His name continues to be used within the family, currently by Eppa Hunton VI, who practices law in Richmond. In 1977, Hunton & Williams established the Eppa Hunton IV Memorial Book Award at the University of Virginia's School of Law, in honor of this Eppa Hunton's grandson (1904-1976), whose baptism the grandfather had witnessed at St. James Episcopal Church in Warrenton. According to the University, the award is \\"presented annually to a third-year student who has demonstrated unusual aptitude in litigation courses and shown a keen awareness and understanding of the lawyer's ethical and professional responsibility.\\" Some of his speeches are held at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., among others in the papers of Frederick Douglass.https://www.loc.gov/item/mfd.38005/ His home in Warrenton, Brentmoor is a historic site, although perhaps now better known for its links to its builder Judge Edward M.

At the time of the 1917 Revolution, the Russian Orthodox Church was deeply integrated into the autocratic state, enjoying official status. This was a significant factor that contributed to the Bolshevik attitude to religion and the steps they took to control it. Thus the USSR became the first state to have as one objective of its official ideology the elimination of existing religion, and the prevention of future implanting of religious belief, with the goal of establishing state atheism (gosateizm). Under the doctrine of state atheism in the Soviet Union, there was a \\"government-sponsored program of conversion to atheism\\" conducted by Communists.Religion and the State in Russia and China: Suppression, Survival, and Revival, by Christopher Marsh, page 47. Continuum International Publishing Group, 2011.Inside Central Asia: A Political and Cultural History, by Dilip Hiro. Penguin, 2009. The Communist regime targeted religions based on State interests, and while most organized religions were never outlawed, religious property was confiscated, believers were harassed, and religion was ridiculed while atheism was propagated in schools. In 1925 the government founded the League of Militant Atheists to intensify the persecution.Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; p.494\\" Accordingly, personal expressions of religious faith were not in any way privately banned, but a strong sense of social stigma was imposed on them by the official government structures and secular mass media, and it was generally considered unacceptable for members of certain government professions (teachers, state bureaucrats, soldiers) to be openly religious and anti-secular. The vast majority of people in the Russian empire were, at the time of the revolution, religious believers, whereas the communists aimed to break the power of all religious institutions and eventually replace religious belief with atheism. \\"Science\\" was counterposed to \\"religious superstition\\" in the media and in academic writing. The main religions of pre-revolutionary Russia persisted throughout the entire Soviet period, but they were only tolerated within certain limits. Generally, this meant that believers were free to worship in private and in their respective religious buildings (churches, mosques, synagogues etc.), but public displays of religion outside of such designations were prohibited. In addition, religious institutions were not allowed to express their views in any type of mass media, and many religious buildings were demolished or used for other purposes. In the long run, state atheism failed to convert many people. Religion strengthened underground and was revived to help fight the Second World War. It flourished after the fall of Communism. As Paul Froese explains: :Atheists waged a 70-year war on religious belief in the Soviet Union. The Communist Party destroyed churches, mosques, and temples; it executed religious leaders; it flooded the schools and media with anti-religious propaganda; and it introduced a belief system called ‚Äúscientific atheism,‚Äù complete with atheist rituals, proselytizers, and a promise of worldly salvation. But in the end, a majority of older Soviet citizens retained their religious beliefs and a crop of citizens too young to have experienced pre-Soviet times acquired religious beliefs.Paul Froese, Paul. \\"Forced secularization in Soviet Russia: Why an atheistic monopoly failed.\\" Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion 43.1 (2004): 35-50. online Christians belonged to various denominations: Orthodox (which had the largest number of followers), Catholic, Baptist and various other Protestant denominations. The majority of the Muslims in the Soviet Union were Sunni, with the notable exception of Azerbaijan, which was majority Shia. Judaism also had many followers. Other religions, practiced by a small number of believers, included Buddhism and Shamanism. Marxism-Leninism and Religion As the founder of the Soviet state, Vladimir Lenin, put it: > Religion is the opium of the people: this saying of Marx is the cornerstone > of the entire ideology of Marxism about religion. All modern religions and > churches, all and of every kind of religious organizations are always > considered by Marxism as the organs of bourgeois reaction, used for the > protection of the exploitation and the stupefaction of the working class. Marxist‚ÄìLeninist atheism has consistently advocated the control, suppression, and elimination of religion. Within about a year of the revolution, the state expropriated all church property, including the churches themselves, and in the period from 1922 to 1926, 28 Russian Orthodox bishops and more than 1,200 priests were killed. Many more were persecuted.Country Studies: Russia-The Russian Orthodox Church U.S. Library of Congress, Accessed 2008-04-03war on religion by Paul Kengor Christianity =Orthodox= Cathedral of Christ the Savior in Moscow was demolished by the Soviet authorities in 1931 to make way for the Palace of Soviets. The palace was never finished, and the cathedral was rebuilt in 2000. Orthodox Christians constituted a majority of believers in the Soviet Union. In the late 1980s, three Orthodox churches claimed substantial memberships there: the Russian Orthodox Church, the Georgian Orthodox Church, and the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (AOC). They were members of the major confederation of Orthodox churches in the world, generally referred to as the Eastern Orthodox Church. The first two functioned openly and were tolerated by the regime, but the Ukrainian AOC was not permitted to function openly. Parishes of the Belarusian Autocephalous Orthodox Church reappeared in Belarus only after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, but they did not receive recognition from the Belarusian Exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church, which controls Belarusian eparchies.N. S. Timasheff, Religion In Soviet Russia 1917-1942 (1942) online Russian Orthodox Church According to both Soviet and Western sources, in the late 1980s the Russian Orthodox Church had over 50 million believers but only about 7,000 registered active churches. Over 4,000 of these churches were located in the Ukrainian Republic (almost half of them in western Ukraine). The distribution of the six monasteries and ten convents of the Russian Orthodox Church was equally disproportionate. Only two of the monasteries were located in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. Another two were in Ukraine and there was one each in Belarus and Lithuania. Seven convents were located in Ukraine and one each in Moldova, Estonia, and Latvia.  Georgian Orthodox Church  The Georgian Orthodox Church, another autocephalous member of Eastern Orthodoxy, was headed by a Georgian patriarch. In the late 1980s it had 15 bishops, 180 priests, 200 parishes, and an estimated 2.5 million followers. In 1811 the Georgian Orthodox Church was incorporated into the Russian Orthodox Church, but it regained its independence in 1917, after the fall of the Tsar. Nevertheless, the Russian Orthodox Church did not officially recognize its independence until 1943.  Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church  The Ukrainian AOC separated from the Russian Orthodox Church in 1919, when the short-lived Ukrainian state adopted a decree declaring autocephaly from the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. Its independence was reaffirmed by the Bolsheviks in the Ukrainian Republic, and by 1924 it had 30 bishops, almost 1,500 priests, nearly 1,100 parishes, and between 4 and 6 million members. From its inception, the Ukrainian AOC faced the hostility of the Russian Orthodox Church in the Ukrainian Republic. In the late 1920s, Soviet authorities accused it of nationalist tendencies. In 1930 the government forced the church to reorganize as the \\"Ukrainian Orthodox Church\\", and few of its parishes survived until 1936. Nevertheless, the Ukrainian AOC continued to function outside the borders of the Soviet Union, and it was revived on Ukrainian territory under the German occupation during World War II. In the late 1980s, some of the Orthodox faithful in the Ukrainian Republic appealed to the Soviet government to reestablish the Ukrainian AOC. Armenian Apostolic The Armenian Apostolic Church is an independent Oriental Orthodox church. In the 1980s it had about 4 million adherents ‚Äì almost the entire population of Armenia. It was permitted 6 bishops, between 50 and 100 priests, and between 20 and 30 churches, and it had one theological seminary and six monasteries. =Catholics= Catholics formed a substantial and active religious constituency in the Soviet Union. Their number increased dramatically with the annexation of territories of the Second Polish Republic in 1939 and the Baltic republics in 1940. Catholics in the Soviet Union were divided between those belonging to the Roman Catholic Church, which was recognized by the government, and those remaining loyal to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, banned since 1946. Roman Catholic Church The majority of the 5.5 million Roman Catholics in the Soviet Union lived in the Lithuanian, Belarusian, and Latvian republics, with a sprinkling in the Moldavian, Ukrainian, and Russian republics. Since World War II, the most active Roman Catholic Church in the Soviet Union was in the Lithuanian Republic, where the majority of people are Catholics. The Roman Catholic Church there has been viewed as an institution that both fosters and defends Lithuanian national interests and values. Since 1972 a Catholic underground publication, The Chronicle of the Catholic Church in Lithuania, supported not only Lithuanians' religious rights but also their national rights. Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church Western Ukraine, which included largely the historic region of Galicia, became part of the Soviet Union in 1939. Although Ukrainian, its population was never part of the Russian Empire, but was Eastern Rite Catholic. After the Second World War, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church identified closely with the nationalist aspirations of the region, arousing the hostility of the Soviet government, which was in combat with Ukrainian Insurgency. In 1945, Soviet authorities arrested the church's Metropolitan Josyf Slipyj, nine bishops and hundreds of clergy and leading lay activists, and deported them to forced labor camps in Siberia and elsewhere. The nine bishops and many of the clergy died in prisons, concentration camps, internal exile, or soon after their release during the post-Stalin thaw, but after 18 years of imprisonment and persecution, Metropolitan Slipyj was released when Pope John XXIII intervened on his behalf. Slipyj went to Rome, where he received the title of Major Archbishop of Lviv, and became a cardinal in 1965. In 1946 a synod was called in Lviv, where, despite being uncanonical in both Catholic and Orthodox understanding, the Union of Brest was annulled, and the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church was officially annexed to the Russian Orthodox Church. St. George's Cathedral in Lviv became the throne of Russian Orthodox Archbishop Makariy. For the clergy that joined the Russian Orthodox Church, the Soviet authorities refrained from the large-scale persecution seen elsewhere. In Lviv only one church was closed. In fact, the western dioceses of Lviv-Ternopil and Ivano-Frankivsk were the largest in the USSR. Canon law was also relaxed, allowing the clergy to shave their beards (a practice uncommon in Orthodoxy) and to conduct services in Ukrainian instead of Slavonic. In 1989 the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church was officially re- established after a catacomb period of more than 40 years. There followed conflicts between Orthodox and Catholic Christians regarding the ownership of church buildings, conflicts which continued into the 1990s, after the Independence of Ukraine. =Protestants= Protestant communities (particularly Lutherans) first appeared in Russia in the 16th and 17th centuries in connection with expatriate communities from western Europe. In the 18th century, under Catherine II (the Great), large numbers of German settlers were invited to Russia, including Mennonites, Lutherans, Reformed and also Roman Catholics. From the 17th to the 19th centuries, various new religious movements emerged from the Russian Orthodox Church (including Molokans, Dukhobors, Khlysts, and to some extent, Subbotniks, and in 19th century Tolstoyan rural communes), and their existence prepared the ground for Protestantism's future spread. The first Russian Baptist communities arose in unrelated strains in three widely separated regions of the Russian Empire (Transcaucasia, Ukraine, and St. Petersburg) in the 1860s and 1870s. In the early twentieth century, Pentecostal groups also formed. In the very early years of Soviet power, the Bolsheviks focused their anti-religious efforts on the Russian Orthodox Church and it appeared to take a less hostile position towards the 'sectarians'. Already before Stalin's rise to power, the situation changed, however. And from the start of the 1930s, Protestants - like other religious groups - experienced the full force of Soviet repression. Churches were shut and religious leaders were arrested and convicted, often charged with anti-Soviet activity. One of the leaders of the Pentecostals movement, Ivan Voronaev, was sentenced to death in 1937, for example.  Baptists, Evangelical Christians, and Pentecostals  The Second World War saw a relaxation of church-state relations in the Soviet Union and the Protestant community benefited alongside their Russian Orthodox counterparts. In 1944, the All-Union Council of Evangelical Christians-Baptists was formed, bringing together the two main strands within Russian Protestantism. Over the following two years, the leaders of the two main Pentecostal branches within the Soviet Union also agreed to join. The immediate post-war period saw the growth of Baptist and Pentecostal congregations and there was a religious revival in these years. Statistics provided by the leaders of the registered church suggest 250,000 baptised members in 1946 rising to 540,000 by 1958.State Archive of the Russian Federation (GARF), f. 6991, op. 4, d. 6 and d. 94. In fact the influence of the Protestantism was much wider than these figures suggest: in addition to the existence of unregistered Baptist and Pentecostal groups, there were also thousands who attended worship without taking baptism. Many Baptist and Pentecostal congregations were in Ukraine. Women significantly outnumbered men in these congregations, though the pastors were male.N. Beliakova and Miriam Dobson, ‚ÄòProtestant women in the late Soviet era: gender, authority, and dissent‚Äô, Canadian Slavonic Papers, 58 (2), 2016, 117-140. By 1991, Ukraine had the second largest Baptist community in the world, behind only the United States. Although the Soviet state had established the All-Union Council of Evangelical Christians-Baptists in 1944, and encouraged congregations to register, this did not signal the end to the persecution of Christians. Many leaders and ordinary believers of different Protestant communities fell victims to the persecution by Communist regime, including imprisonment. Persecution was particularly vicious in the years 1948-53 and again in the early 1960s. Despite the Soviet state's attempt to create a single, unified church movement, there were many divisions within the evangelical church. In the early 1960s, a break-away group formed a new movement which called for a spiritual awakening and greater independence from the Soviet state. Leaders of this group (eventually known as the Council of the Church of Evangelical Christians-Baptists) faced particularly persecution. Pentecostals, too, formed their own, underground organisation and were targeted by the state as a result. Lutherans Lutherans, the second largest Protestant group, lived for the most part in the Latvian and Estonian republics. In the 1980s, Lutheran churches in these republics identified to some extent with nationality issues in the two republics. The regime's attitude toward Lutherans was generally benign. The Lutheran Church in different regions of the country was persecuted during the Soviet era, and church property was confiscated.Lutheran Churches. Religious Information Service of Ukraine. Many of its members and pastors were oppressed, and some were forced to emigrate.Keston Institute and the Defence of Persecuted Christians in the USSR. Other Protestants A number of other Protestant groups were present, including Adventists and Reformed. =Other Christian groups= The March 1961 instruction on religious cults explained for the first time, that \\"sects, the teaching and character of activities of which has anti-state and savagely extremist [–∏–∑—É–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∫–∏–π] character: Jehovah's Witnesses, Pentecostalists, Adventists-reformists\\" are not to be registered–ì–ê–†–§. –§. 6991. –û–ø. 2. –î. 306. –õ. 11‚Äì12. and were thus banned. A number of congregations of Russian Mennonites, Jehovah's Witnesses, and other Christian groups existed in the Soviet Union. Nearly 9,000 Jehovah's Witnesses were deported to Siberia in 1951 (numbers of those missed in deportation unknown). The number of Jehovah's Witnesses increased greatly over this period, with a KGB estimate of around 20,000 in 1968. Russian Mennonites began to emigrate from the Soviet Union in the face of increasing violence and persecution, state restrictions on freedom of religion, and biased allotments of communal farmland. They emigrated to Germany, Britain, the United States, parts of South America, and other regions.  Islam  Map showing the distribution of Muslims within the Soviet Union in 1979 as a percentage of the population by administrative division. After the Bolshevik revolution, Islam was for some time (until 1929) treated better than the Russian Orthodox Church, which Bolsheviks regarded as a center of the \\"reaction\\", and other religions. In the declaration \\"–ö–æ –≤—Å–µ–º —Ç—Ä—É–¥—è—â–∏–º—Å—è –º—É—Å—É–ª—å–º–∞–Ω–∞–º –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ –∏ –í–æ—Å—Ç–æ–∫–∞\\" (To All Working Muslims in Russia and the Orient) of November 1917, the Bolshevik government declared the freedom to exercise their religion and customs for Muslims \\"whose beliefs and customs had been suppressed by the Czars and the Russian oppressors\\".–ö–æ –≤—Å–µ–º —Ç—Ä—É–¥—è—â–∏–º—Å—è –º—É—Å—É–ª—å–º–∞–Ω–∞–º –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ –∏ –í–æ—Å—Ç–æ–∫–∞ In the second half of 1920s and in 1930s, state repressions, suppression and atheist propaganda against all religions increased.

Page 118. In the late 1980s, Islam had the second largest following in the Soviet Union: between 45 and 50 million people identified themselves as Muslims. But the Soviet Union had only about 500 working mosques, a fraction of the number in prerevolutionary Russia, and Soviet law forbade Islamic religious activity outside working mosques and Islamic schools. All working mosques, religious schools, and Islamic publications were supervised by four \\"spiritual directorates\\" established by Soviet authorities to provide government control. The Spiritual Directorate for Central Asia and Kazakhstan, the Spiritual Directorate for the European Soviet Union and Siberia, and the Spiritual Directorate for the Northern Caucasus and Dagestan oversaw the religious life of Sunni Muslims. The Spiritual Directorate for Transcaucasia dealt with both Sunni Muslims and Shia Muslims. The overwhelming majority of the Muslims were Sunnis. Soviet Muslims differed linguistically and culturally from each other, speaking about fifteen Turkic languages, ten Iranian languages, and thirty Caucasian languages. Hence, communication between different Muslim groups was difficult. In 1989 Russian often served as a lingua franca among some educated Muslims. Culturally, some Muslim groups had highly developed urban traditions, whereas others were recently nomadic. Some lived in industrialized environments, others in isolated mountainous regions. In sum, Muslims were not a homogeneous group with a common national identity and heritage, although they shared the same religion and the same country. In the late 1980s, unofficial Muslim congregations, meeting in tea houses and private homes with their own mullahs, greatly outnumbered those in the officially sanctioned mosques. The unofficial mullahs were either self-taught or informally trained by other mullahs. In the late 1980s, unofficial Islam appeared to split into fundamentalist congregations and groups that emphasized Sufism.  Policy toward religions in practice  Soviet policy toward religion was based on the ideology of Marxism-Leninism, which made atheism the official doctrine of the Communist Party. However, \\"the Soviet law and administrative practice through most of the 1920s extended some tolerance to religion and forbade the arbitrary closing or destruction of some functioning churches\\",Fitzpatrick, S. Everyday Stalinism. Oxford University Press. New York, 1999. page 27. and each successive Soviet constitution granted freedom of belief. As the founder of the Soviet state, Lenin, put it: > Religion is the opium of the people: this saying of Marx is the cornerstone > of the entire ideology of Marxism about religion. All modern religions and > churches, all and of every kind of religious organizations are always > considered by Marxism as the organs of bourgeois reaction, used for the > protection of the exploitation and the stupefaction of the working class. Marxism-Leninism advocates the suppression and ultimately the disappearance of religious beliefs, considering them to be \\"unscientific\\" and \\"superstitious\\". In the 1920s and 1930s, such organizations as the League of the Militant Godless were active in anti-religious propaganda. Atheism was the norm in schools, communist organizations (such as the Young Pioneer Organization), and the media. The regime's efforts to eradicate religion in the Soviet Union, however, varied over the years with respect to particular religions and were affected by higher state interests. In 1923, a New York Times correspondent saw Christians observing Easter peacefully in Moscow despite violent anti- religious actions in previous years.\\"Moscow Keeps Easter; No Riots Expected; A Faithful Few Still Go to Church and Are Unmolested\\", The New York Times. 6 April 1923. Page 4. Retrieved 2011-03-14.

On the drive against religion in 1929‚Äì30. > Stalin's Peasants. New-York, 1994. pages 59‚Äì63.Fitzpatrick, S. Everyday > Stalinism. New-York, 1999. p.27 Although all Soviet leaders had the same long-range goal of developing a cohesive Soviet people, they pursued different policies to achieve it. For the Soviet regime, questions of nationality and religion were always closely linked. Therefore, their attitude toward religion also varied from a total ban on some religions to official support of others. = Policy towards nationalities and religion = In theory, the Soviet Constitution described the regime's position regarding nationalities and religions. It stated that every Soviet citizen also had a particular nationality, and every Soviet passport carried these two entries. The constitution granted a large degree of local autonomy, but this autonomy was subordinated to central authority. In addition, because local and central administrative structures were often not clearly divided, local autonomy was further weakened. Although under the Constitution all nationalities were equal, in practice they were not treated so. Only fifteen nationalities had union republic status, which granted them, in principle, many rights, including the right to secede from the union. Twenty-two nationalities lived in autonomous republics with a degree of local self-government and representation in the Council of Nationalities in the Supreme Soviet. Eighteen more nationalities had territorial enclaves (autonomous oblasts and autonomous okrugs) but had very few powers of self- government. The remaining nationalities had no right of self-government at all. Joseph Stalin's 1913 definition of a nation as \\"a historically constituted and stable community of people formed on the basis of common language, territory, economic life, and psychological makeup revealed in a common culture\\" was retained by Soviet authorities throughout the 1980s. However, in granting nationalities union republic status, three additional factors were considered: a population of at least 1 million, territorial compactness, and location on the borders of the Soviet Union. Although Lenin believed that eventually all nationalities would merge into one, he insisted that the Soviet Union be established as a federation of formally equal nations. In the 1920s, genuine cultural concessions were granted to the nationalities. Communist elites of various nationalities were permitted to flourish and to have considerable self-government. National cultures, religions, and languages were not merely tolerated but, in areas with Muslim populations, encouraged. Demographic changes in the 1960s and 1970s whittled down the overall Russian majority, but they also caused two nationalities (the Kazakhs and Kirgiz) to become minorities in their own republics at the time of the 1979 census, and considerably reduced the majority of the titular nationalities in other republics. This situation led Leonid Brezhnev to declare at the 24th Communist Party Congress in 1971 that the process of creating a unified Soviet people had been completed, and proposals were made to abolish the federative system and replace it with a single state. In the 1970s, however, a broad movement of national dissent began to spread throughout the Soviet Union. It manifestated itself in many ways: Jews insisted on their right to emigrate to Israel; Crimean Tatars demanded to be allowed to return to Crimea; Lithuanians called for the restoration of the rights of the Catholic Church; and Helsinki Watch groups were established in the Georgian, Lithuanian, and Ukrainian republics. Petitions, literature, and occasional public demonstrations voiced public demands for the human rights of all nationalities. By the end of the 1970s, however, massive and concerted efforts by the KGB had largely suppressed the national dissent movement. Nevertheless, Brezhnev had learned his lesson. Proposals to dismantle the federative system were abandoned in favour of a policy of drawing the nationalities together more gradually. Soviet officials identified religion closely with nationality. The implementation of policy toward a particular religion, therefore, depended on the regime's perception of the bond between that religion and the nationality practicing it, the size of the religious community, the extent to which the religion accepted outside authority, and the nationality's willingness to subordinate itself to political authority. Thus the smaller the religious community and the more closely it identified with a particular nationality, the more restrictive were the regime's policies, especially if the religion also recognized a foreign authority such as the pope. = Policy towards Orthodoxy = The Russian Orthodox Cathedral, once the most dominant landmark in Baku, was demolished in the 1930s under Stalin. As for the Russian Orthodox Church, Soviet authorities sought to control it and, in times of national crisis, to exploit it for the regime's own purposes; but their ultimate goal was to eliminate it. During the first five years of Soviet power, the Bolsheviks executed 28 Russian Orthodox bishops and over 1,200 Russian Orthodox priests. Many others were imprisoned or exiled. Believers were harassed and persecuted. Most seminaries were closed, and the publication of most religious material was prohibited. By 1941 only 500 churches remained open out of about 54,000 in existence prior to World War I. Such crackdowns related to many people's dissatisfaction with the church in pre-revolutionary Russia. The close ties between the church and the state led to the perception of the church as corrupt and greedy by many members of the intelligentsia. Many peasants, while highly religious, also viewed the church unfavorably. Respect for religion did not extend to the local priests. The church owned a significant portion of Russia's land, and this was a bone of contention ‚Äì land ownership was a big factor in the Russian Revolution of 1917. The Nazi attack on the Soviet Union in 1941 induced Stalin to enlist the Russian Orthodox Church as an ally to arouse Russian patriotism against foreign aggression. Russian Orthodox religious life experienced a revival: thousands of churches were reopened; there were 22,000 by the time Nikita Khrushchev came to power. The regime permitted religious publications, and church membership grew. Khrushchev reversed the regime's policy of cooperation with the Russian Orthodox Church. Although it remained officially sanctioned, in 1959 Khrushchev launched an antireligious campaign that was continued in a less stringent manner by his successor, Brezhnev. By 1975 the number of active Russian Orthodox churches was reduced to 7,000. Some of the most prominent members of the Russian Orthodox hierarchy and some activists were jailed or forced to leave the church. Their place was taken by docile clergy who were obedient to the state and who were sometimes infiltrated by KGB agents, making the Russian Orthodox Church useful to the regime. It espoused and propagated Soviet foreign policy and furthered the russification of non-Russian Christians, such as Orthodox Ukrainians and Belarusians. The regime applied a different policy toward the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church and the Belarusian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. Viewed by the government as very nationalistic, both were suppressed, first at the end of the 1920s and again in 1944 after they had renewed themselves under German occupation. The leadership of both churches was decimated; large numbers of priests were shot or sent to labor camps, and members of their congregations were harassed and persecuted. The Georgian Orthodox Church was subject to a somewhat different policy and fared far worse than the Russian Orthodox Church. During World War II, however, it was allowed greater autonomy in running its affairs in return for calling its members to support the war effort, although it did not achieve the kind of accommodation with the authorities that the Russian Orthodox Church had. The government reimposed tight control over it after the war. Out of some 2,100 churches in 1917, only 200 were still open in the 1980s, and it was forbidden to serve its adherents outside the Georgian Republic. In many cases, the regime forced the Georgian Orthodox Church to conduct services in Old Church Slavonic instead of in the Georgian language. = Policy towards Catholicism and Protestantism = The Soviet government's policies toward the Catholic Church were strongly influenced by Soviet Catholics' recognition of an outside authority as head of their church. As a result of World War II, millions of Catholics (including Greco-Catholics) became Soviet citizens and were subjected to new repression. Also, in the three republics where most of the Catholics lived, the Lithuanian SSR, the Byelorussian SSR and the Ukrainian SSR, Catholicism and nationalism were closely linked. Although the Roman Catholic Church was tolerated in Lithuania, large numbers of the clergy were imprisoned, many seminaries were closed, and police agents infiltrated the remainder. The anti-Catholic campaign in Lithuania abated after Stalin's death, but harsh measures against the church were resumed in 1957 and continued through the Brezhnev era. Soviet policy was particularly harsh toward the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church. Ukrainian Greek-Catholics came under Soviet rule in 1939, when western Ukraine was incorporated into the Soviet Union as part of the Nazi-Soviet Nonaggression Pact. Although the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church was permitted to function, it was almost immediately subjected to intense harassment. Retreating before the German army in 1941, Soviet authorities arrested large numbers of Ukrainian Greek Catholic priests, who were either killed or deported to Siberia. After the Red Army reoccupied western Ukraine in 1944, the Soviet regime liquidated the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church by arresting its metropolitan, all of its bishops, hundreds of clergy, and the more active church members, killing some and sending the rest to labor camps. At the same time, Soviet authorities forced the remaining clergy to abrogate the union with Rome and subordinate themselves to the Russian Orthodox Church. Before World War II, there were fewer Protestants in the Soviet Union than adherents of other faiths, but they showed remarkable growth since then. In 1944 the Soviet government established the All-Union Council of Evangelical Christian Baptists (now the Union of Evangelical Christians-Baptists of Russia) to gain some control over the various Protestant sects. Many congregations refused to join this body, however, and others that initially joined it subsequently left. All found that the state, through the council, was interfering in church life. =Policy toward other Christian groups= A number of congregations of Russian Mennonites, Jehovah's Witnesses, and other Christian groups faced varying levels of persecution under Soviet rule. Jehovah's Witnesses were banned from practicing their religion. Under Operation North, the personal property of over eight-thousand members was confiscated, and they (along with underage children) were exiled to Siberia from 1951 until repeal in 1965. All were asked to sign a declaration of resignation as a Jehovah's Witness in order to not be deported. There is no existing record of any having signed this declaration. While in Siberia, some men, women, and children were forced to work as lumberjacks for a fixed wage. Victims reported living conditions to be very poor. From 1951 to 1991, Jehovah's Witnesses within and outside Siberia were incarcerated ‚Äì and then rearrested after serving their terms. Some were forced to work in concentration camps, others forcibly enrolled in Marxist reeducation programs. KGB officials infiltrated the Jehovah's Witnesses organization in the Soviet Union, mostly to seek out hidden caches of theological literature. Soviet propaganda films depicted Jehovah's Witnesses as a cult, extremist, and engaging in mind control. Jehovah's Witnesses were legalized in the Soviet Union in 1991; victims were given social benefits equivalent to those of war veterans. Early in the Bolshevik period, predominantly before the end of the Russian Civil War and the emergence of the Soviet Union, Russian Mennonite communities were harassed; several Mennonites were killed or imprisoned, and women were raped. Anarcho- Communist Nestor Makhno was responsible for most of the bloodshed, which caused the normally pacifist Mennonites to take up arms in defensive militia units. This marked the beginning of a mass exodus of Mennonites to Germany, the United States, and elsewhere. Mennonites were branded as kulaks by the Soviets. Their colonies' farms were collectivized under the Soviet Union's communal farming policy. Being predominantly German settlers, the Russian Mennonites in World War II saw the German forces invading Russia as liberators. Many were allowed passage to Germany as Volksdeutsche. Soviet officials began exiling Mennonite settlers in the eastern part of Russia to Siberia. After the war, the remaining Russian Mennonites were branded as Nazi conspirators and exiled to Kazakhstan and Siberia, sometimes being imprisoned or forced to work in concentration camps. In the 1990s the Russian government gave the Mennonites in Kazakhstan and Siberia the opportunity to emigrate. = Policy towards Islam = Soviet policy toward Islam was affected, on the one hand by the large Muslim population, its close ties to national cultures, and its tendency to accept Soviet authority, and on the other hand by its susceptibility to foreign influence. Although actively encouraging atheism, Soviet authorities permitted some limited religious activity in all the Muslim republics, under the auspices of the regional branches of the Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of Central Asia and Kazakhstan. Mosques functioned in most large cities of the Central Asian republics, the Caucasus, Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, Crimea, the Azerbaijan Republic, and elsewhere, but their number decreased from 25,000 in 1917 to 500 in the 1970s. Under Stalinist rule, Soviet authorities cracked down on Muslim clergy, closing many mosques or turning them into warehouses.Helene Carrere d'Encausse, The National Republics Lose Their Independence, in Edward A. Allworth, (edit), Central Asia: One Hundred Thirty Years of Russian Dominance, A Historical Overview. Duke University Press, 1994. In 1989, as part of the general relaxation of restrictions on religions, some additional Muslim religious associations were registered, and some of the mosques that had been closed by the government were returned to Muslim communities. The government also announced plans to permit the training of limited numbers of Muslim religious leaders in two- and five-year courses in Ufa and Baku, respectively. = Policy towards Judaism = Although Lenin publicly condemned anti-Semitism, the regime was hostile toward Judaism from the beginning.https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/archives/anti.html In 1919 the Soviet authorities abolished Jewish community councils, which were traditionally responsible for maintaining synagogues. They created a special Jewish section of the party, whose tasks included propaganda against Jewish clergy and religion. To offset Jewish national and religious aspirations, and to reflect the Jewish national movement's role in the socialist movement of the Russian Empire (for example, Trotsky was first a member of the Jewish Bund, not the Social Democratic Labour Party), an alternative to the Land of Israel was established in 1934. The Jewish Autonomous Oblast, created in 1928 by Stalin, with Birobidzhan in the Russian Far East as its administrative center, was to become a \\"Soviet Zion\\". Yiddish, rather than \\"reactionary\\" Hebrew, would be the national language, and proletarian socialist literature and arts would replace Judaism as the quintessence of its culture. Despite a massive domestic and international state propaganda campaign, the Jewish population there never reached 30% (as of 2003 it was only about 1.2%). The experiment ended in the mid-1930s, during Stalin's first campaign of purges. Jewish leaders were arrested and executed, and Yiddish schools were shut down. Further persecutions and purges followed.Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar, Montefiore, 2007 The training of rabbis became impossible until the early 1940s, and until the late 1980s only one Yiddish periodical was published. Because of its identification with Zionism, Hebrew was taught only in schools for diplomats. Most of the 5,000 synagogues functioning prior to the Bolshevik Revolution were closed under Stalin, and others were closed under Khrushchev. The practice of Judaism became very difficult, intensifying the desire of Jews to leave the Soviet Union.

The story focuses on an impoverished but aspirational adolescent girl and her family living in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York City, during the first two decades of the 20th century. The book was an immense success. It was also released in an Armed Services Edition, the size of a mass-market paperback, to fit in a uniform pocket. One Marine wrote to Smith, \\"I can't explain the emotional reaction that took place in this dead heart of mine...A surge of confidence has swept through me, and I feel that maybe a fellow has a fighting chance in this world after all.\\"The Wall Street Journal, October 6, 2018, pg. C14. The main metaphor of the book is the hardy Tree of Heaven, whose persistent ability to grow and flourish even in the inner city mirrors the protagonist's desire to better herself. Plot The novel is split into five \\"books\\", each covering a different period in the characters' lives. =Book One= Book One opens in 1912 and introduces 11-year-old Francie Nolan, who lives in the Williamsburg tenement neighborhood of Brooklyn with her 10-year-old brother Cornelius (\\"Neeley\\" for short) and their parents, Johnny and Katie. Francie relies on her imagination and her love of reading to provide a temporary escape from the poverty that defines her daily existence. The family subsists on Katie's wages from cleaning apartment buildings, pennies from the children's junk-selling and odd jobs, and Johnny's irregular earnings as a singing waiter. His alcoholism has made it difficult for him to hold a steady job, and he sees himself as a disappointment to his family as a result. Francie admires him because he is handsome, talented, imaginative, and sentimental, as she is. Katie has very little time for sentiment, since she is the breadwinner of the family who has forsaken fantasies and dreams for survival. =Book Two= Book Two jumps back to 1900, with the meeting of Johnny and Katie, the teenage children of immigrants from Ireland and Austria, respectively. Although Johnny panics and begins drinking heavily when Katie becomes pregnant with first Francie and then Neeley, Katie resolves to give her children a better life than she has known, resolving to follow her mother's insistence that they receive a good education. Kate resents Francie because the baby is constantly ill, while Neeley is more robust. Katie makes a promise to herself that her daughter must never learn of her preference for Neeley. During the first seven years of their marriage, the Nolans are forced to move twice within Williamsburg, due to public disgraces caused first by Johnny's drunkenness and later by the children's Aunt Sissy's misguided efforts at babysitting them. The Nolans then arrive at the apartment introduced in Book one. =Book Three= In Book Three, the Nolans settle into their new home, and seven-year-old Francie and six-year-old Neeley begin to attend the squalid, overcrowded public school next door. Francie enjoys learning, even in these dismal surroundings, and gets herself transferred to a better school in a different neighborhood with Johnny's support. Johnny's attempts to improve the children's minds fail, but Katie helps Francie grow as a person and saves her life by shooting a child-rapist/murderer who tries to attack Francie shortly before her 14th birthday. When Johnny learns that Katie is pregnant once again, he falls into a depression that leads to his death from alcoholism-induced pneumonia on Christmas Day 1915. Katie cashes in the family's life insurance policies on Johnny and the children and uses that money, along with their earnings from after-school jobs, to bury Johnny and keep the family afloat in 1916. The new baby, Annie Laurie, is born that May, and Francie graduates from grade school in June. Graduation allows Francie to finally come to terms with the reality of her father‚Äôs death. =Book Four= At the start of Book Four, Francie and Neeley take jobs because there is no money to send them to high school. Francie works in an artificial flower factory, then gets a better-paying job in a press clipping office after lying about her age. Although she wants to use her salary to start high school in the fall, Katie decides to send Neeley instead, reasoning that he will only continue learning if he is forced into it, while Francie will find a way to do it on her own. Once the United States enters World War I in 1917, the clipping office rapidly declines and closes, leaving Francie out of a job. After she finds work as a teletype operator, she makes a new plan for her education, choosing to skip high school and take summer college-level courses. She passes with the help of Ben Blake, a friendly and determined high school student, but she fails the college's entrance exams. A brief encounter with Lee Rhynor, a soldier preparing to ship out to France, leads to heartbreak after he pretends to be in love with Francie, when he is in fact about to get married. In 1918, Katie accepts a marriage proposal from Michael McShane, a retired police officer who has long admired her and has become a wealthy businessman and politician since leaving the force. =Book Five= As Book Five begins in the fall of this same year, Francie, now almost 17, quits her teletype job. She is about to start classes at the University of Michigan, having passed the entrance exams with Ben's help, and is considering the possibility of a future relationship with him. The Nolans prepare for Katie's wedding and the move from their Brooklyn apartment to McShane's home. Francie pays one last visit to some of her favorite childhood places and reflects on all the people who have come and gone in her life. She is struck by how much of Johnny's character lives on in Neely who has become a talented jazz/ragtime piano player. Before she leaves the apartment, Francie notices the Tree of Heaven that has grown and re-sprouted in the building's yard despite all efforts to destroy it, seeing in it a metaphor for her family's ability to overcome adversity and thrive. In the habits of a neighborhood girl, Florry, Francie sees a version of her young self, sitting on the fire escape with a book and watching the young ladies of the neighborhood prepare for their dates. Francie says, \\"Hello, Francie\\", to Florry, and then, \\"Goodbye, Francie\\" as she closes the window. Characters Mary Frances \\"Francie\\" Nolan is the protagonist. The novel begins when Francie is 11 years old. The rest of the novel tells of Francie's life until she goes to college at 17. Francie grows up in Brooklyn in the early twentieth century; her family is in constant poverty throughout most of the novel. Francie shares a great admiration for her father, Johnny Nolan, and wishes for an improved relationship with her mother, hardworking Katie Nolan, recognizing similar traits in her mother and herself that she believes are a barrier to true understanding. The story of Francie traces her individual desires, affections, and hostilities while growing up in an aggressive, individualistic, romantic, and ethnic family and neighborhood; more universally it represents the hopes of immigrants in the early twentieth century to rise above poverty through their children, whom they hope will receive \\"education\\" and take their place among true Americans. Francie is symbolized by the \\"Tree of Heaven\\" that flourishes under the most unlikely urban circumstances. Katie Rommely Nolan is Francie's mother and the youngest of her parents' four daughters. She is a first-generation immigrant with an evil father and an angelic mother who emigrated from Austria. She married Johnny Nolan when she was only 17 years old. Katie is a hardworking, practical woman whose youthful romanticism has been replaced by a frigid realism that often prevents her from sympathizing with those who love her most. She runs her home in such a way that her children are able to enjoy their childhood despite their extreme poverty. Because Johnny is an alcoholic and can rarely hold down a job, Katie becomes the family breadwinner by cleaning apartment buildings. Johnny, however, is more attuned to Francie's hopes of graduating from high school and becoming a writer. As Francie matures and develops an inclination toward academia, Katie realizes she is more devoted to Neeley than to Francie. Katie becomes pregnant just before Johnny dies and survives on her own until she agrees to marry Sergeant Michael McShane, a pipe-smoking local policeman-turned-politician. Sissy Rommely is Katie's oldest sister and one of Francie's three aunts. Because of her parents' immigration and lack of knowledge in their new environment, Sissy never goes to school and is therefore illiterate. Sissy is kind, compassionate and beautiful, and many men fall in love with her. She is first married at 14, but after being unable to have any live children with her husband, Sissy leaves him. She marries two more times without ever getting a divorce. In between marriages, Sissy has a number of lovers. She calls each of her husbands and lovers by the name \\"John\\" until her final husband, who insists that she properly divorce her second husband and demands to be called by his own name, Steve. Sissy has ten stillborn children, but adopts an immigrant girl's baby daughter born out of wedlock and eventually gives birth to a healthy son of her own. Johnny Nolan is Francie's father. He is a first-generation American; his parents immigrated from Ireland. He has a protective mother and had three brothers, all of whom died young. Johnny marries Katie Rommely at nineteen. He is charismatic, a loving husband and father, loved dearly by his family but especially by Francie. He is, however, an alcoholic. When he does hold a job, Johnny works as a singing waiter. He has a beautiful voice, a talent that is greatly admired but that is largely wasted because of his reputation as an alcoholic. After Katie tells him that she is pregnant with their third child, he stops drinking and immediately falls into a deep depression that ends with his death from alcoholism-induced pneumonia. He is a dreamer, in sharp contrast to Katie, whose view of the world is realistic. Cornelius \\"Neeley\\" Nolan is Francie's little brother. He is a year younger than Francie and is favored by his mother, Katie. Neeley is an outgoing child who is more widely accepted by the neighborhood children than Francie. He shows more emotion when his father dies than Francie, who reacts to the loss by becoming even more determined to get an education and rise above her mother's limited vision. Neeley refuses to follow the tradition of Nolan men and determines to never become an alcoholic. Like Francie, he feels that their childhood was pleasant despite their poverty. Eva \\"Evy\\" Rommely Flittman is Katie's youngest sister and Francie's other aunt, playing a role more minor than Sissy's. While considered throughout most of the novel to be in less dire circumstances than Katie, Evy struggles with her lazy husband Willie, a milk-wagon driver. When Willie suffers an injury, Evy drives the route instead and proves surprisingly good at it, treating the horses much more kindly than Willie does. At the end of the novel, he leaves her to travel as a one-man band and she carries on without a husband. When McShane gives Katie $1,000 as a wedding present, she passes $200 on to Evy‚Äîthe value of Willie's life insurance policy. Unlike Sissy, Evy has had only one marriage and is not assumed to be promiscuous. She has three children, a girl (Blossom), and two boys (Paul Jones and Willie, Jr.). Eliza Rommely is Francie's third aunt who is only mentioned once. She became a nun because of her mother's love of the Catholic church. Francie only met her once. At first Francie toyed with the idea of being a nun, but when she saw her aunt's mustache-like facial hair, she thought that happened to all nuns, and changed her mind. Thomas and Mary Rommely are the parents of Sissy, Eliza, Evy, and Katie; they emigrate to America from Austria just before Sissy is born. While Thomas hates America, enjoys tormenting Mary, and forbids the speaking of English at home, Mary patiently endures her hardships and serves as a moral/practical guide for her daughters. Mary cannot read or write English, but she encourages Katie to ensure that her children learn the language, and also to begin saving money so she can buy land someday. The Rommelys' second oldest daughter, Eliza, is mentioned only briefly; she becomes a nun and joins a convent. Flossie Gaddis is one of the Nolans' neighbors, a single woman who scares men away as she constantly looks for new relationships. She keeps her right arm covered at all times to hide scars from a childhood accident with a tub of scalding water. She has a brother, Henny, who is dying of tuberculosis. Lee Rhynor is Francie's first love, a soldier on leave who tries to manipulate Francie into sleeping with him after he wins over her heart. When Francie refuses, he goes back to his fiancee. Ben Blake is a boy Francie befriends during her first summer of college classes. Ben is driven and determined. While he is the object of Francie's affection at first, she feels differently after falling in love with Lee. However, at the end of the novel, Francie goes to college with a promise ring from Ben and hope of a future with him. Themes Although the book addresses many different issues‚Äîpoverty, alcoholism, lying, etc.‚Äîits main theme is the need for tenacity: the determination to rise above difficult circumstances. Although there are naturalistic elements in the book, it is not fundamentally naturalistic. The Nolans are financially restricted by poverty yet find ways to enjoy life and satisfy their needs and wants. For example, Francie can become intoxicated just by looking at flowers. Like the Tree of Heaven, Brooklyn's inhabitants fight for the sun and air necessary to their survival. Idealism and pragmatism are weighed and both found necessary to survival in Brooklyn. Johnny lies about his family's address in order to enable Francie to attend a better school, presenting Francie with opportunities that might not have been available to her otherwise. Sissy helps Johnny recover from alcoholic withdrawals by appealing to his libido, helping Katie and Johnny to stay together despite Johnny's disease. Katie explains love and sexuality to Francie from two somewhat clashing points of view: as a mother and as a woman. The book revises traditional notions of right and wrong and suggests pointedly that extreme poverty changes the criteria on which such notions, and those who embrace them, should be judged. Gender roles are more fluid in A Tree than in previous novels about young people. Katie's hands grow rough as she performs physical labor while Johnny's hands remain smooth and he wears expensive clothing. Francie does not fully begin to realize her own femininity until she can prove useful to her mother in childbirth.

Written by Niven Busch, Stuart N. Lake, and Jo Swerling, the film is about a self-appointed hanging judge in Vinegaroon, Texas, who befriends a saddle tramp who opposes the judge's policy against homesteaders. The film is often remembered for one of Walter Brennan's best performances, as Judge Roy Bean, which led to his winning his record-setting third Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. James Basevi and Stuart N. Lake also received Academy Award nominations for Best Art Direction, Black and White and Best Story, respectively. The supporting cast features Dana Andrews, Chill Wills, and Forrest Tucker. Plot In 1882, the town of Vinegaroon, Texas, is run by Judge Roy Bean (Walter Brennan), who calls himself \\"the only law west of the Pecos.\\" Conducting his \\"trials\\" from his saloon, Bean makes a nice corrupt living collecting fines and seizing property unlawfully. Those who stand up to him are usually hanged‚Äîgiven what Bean calls \\"suspended sentences\\". Cole Harden (Gary Cooper) is a drifter brought in on a charge of stealing a horse belonging to Bean's main sidekick, Chickenfoot (Paul Hurst). Harden's conviction by a jury composed of Bean's hangers-on seems certain; even the undertaker waits eagerly for the verdict and subsequent hanging. Bean dismisses Harden's contention that he bought the horse legally from another man. Noticing the judge's obsession with the English actress Lily Langtry, Harden claims to have met Miss Langtry, spoken with her, and to have known her intimately. He cons the judge into delaying the death sentence until Harden can send for a lock of the actress' hair, which he supposedly has in El Paso. The delay is long enough for the real horse thief (Tom Tyler) to show up and get killed. Despite his warped sense of justice and corrupt nature, Bean genuinely likes Harden, considering him something of a kindred spirit. Harden is as bold and daring as Bean was in his youth, and the judge feels something like friendship for him, but this \\"friendship\\" does not stop Bean from trying to shoot Harden when the drifter lends his support to the homesteaders‚Äîa group led by Jane-Ellen Mathews (Doris Davenport) and her father Caliphet (Fred Stone). The struggling homesteaders have been at odds with Bean and his cattle-rancher allies for a long time. Harden tries to appeal to the judge's better nature. He even saves Bean from an attempted lynching. When that fails, and a corn crop is burned, and Mr. Mathews killed, Harden sees no choice but to take action. He gets himself deputized by the county sheriff and swears out an arrest warrant against Bean. Arresting Bean in Vinegaroon‚Äînow renamed \\"Langtry\\" by the judge in honor of the actress‚Äîis impossible with all of Bean's men around. When Bean learns that Lily Langtry will be appearing in a nearby town, a long day's ride from Vinegaroon, he has one of his men buy up all the tickets. Bean dons his full Confederate Civil War regalia and rides to see the performance with some of his men as an \\"honor guard\\". He enters the theater alone to await the performance, leaving his henchmen outside. Unknown to Bean, Harden has been waiting in the theater to arrest the judge. A standoff and shoot-out occur, and Bean is fatally wounded during the gunfight. Harden carries his dying friend backstage to meet the woman he has adored for so long. As Bean stares at the \\"Jersey Lily\\", he dies. Flash forward to two years later, Harden and Jane, now married and having rebuilt the burned farm, watch as new settlers arrive to the territory.

Although Goldwyn assured Cooper that his role would be expanded, Cooper remained unconvinced, writing to Samuel Goldwyn, \\"I couldn't see that it needed Gary Cooper for the part.\\" Goldwyn remained adamant, though, about Cooper's contractual obligations and insisted that he star in the film. In a formal letter to Goldwyn indicating his intention to sever their future working relationship, Cooper agreed to fulfill his contract and to \\"perform my services ... to the fullest of my ability, with the express understanding that I am doing so under protest.\\"Meyers, Jeffrey. Gary Cooper: American Hero. New York: William Morrow and Company, 1998, pp. 138-141. Cooper and Brennan made such an effective team that they did a total of six films together: The Cowboy and the Lady (1938), The Westerner (1940), Meet John Doe (1940), Sergeant York (1941), Pride of the Yankees (1942), and Task Force (1949).

Heflin won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.. The film was one of many spoofed in Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid (1982). Plot Johnny Eager (Robert Taylor) masquerades as a taxi driver for his gullible parole officer, A. J. Verne (Henry O'Neill), but in reality, he is the ruthless head of a powerful gambling syndicate. Verne introduces him to socialite Lisbeth \\"Liz\\" Bard (Lana Turner), a sociology student. Johnny and Liz are attracted to each other, but then he discovers that she is the stepdaughter of his longtime nemesis, John Benson Farrell (Edward Arnold). As a crusading prosecutor, Farrell was responsible for sending Johnny to prison, and now as the district attorney, he has gotten an injunction preventing Johnny's expensive dog racing track from opening. Johnny decides to use Liz as leverage against her stepfather. When she comes to see him, he has Julio (Paul Stewart), one of his underlings, burst in and pretend to try to kill him. During the faked struggle, Julio drops his gun. Lisbeth picks it up and shoots Julio when he seems to have the upper hand. Johnny then hustles her out of the room before she can realize that the gun is full of blanks and Julio's blood is actually ketchup. Later, Johnny threatens to expose her as a murderer unless Farrell removes the injunction. Farrell gives in. Johnny is depicted as a man without a conscience. When childhood friend Lew Rankin (Barry Nelson) gets fed up with his subordinate role in the gang and starts plotting against him, Johnny murders him without the slightest qualm. He lies to his devoted girlfriend Garnet (Patricia Dane) to get her to go to Florida while he romances Liz. Mae (Glenda Farrell), a prior girlfriend, asks him to help get her incorruptible policeman husband transferred back to his old precinct because his long commute is straining their marriage. Johnny not only lies, claiming he no longer has any influence, he also hides the fact that he got the man transferred in the first place because he would not look the other way. When Jimmy Courtney (Robert Sterling), Liz's high society former boyfriend, becomes alarmed because Liz is going to pieces due to a guilty conscience, he offers Johnny all his money to leave the country and take Liz with him. Johnny cannot figure out his \\"angle\\", why he would do such a selfless thing. In fact, the only soft spot Johnny seems to have is for his intellectual, alcoholic right-hand man, Jeff Hartnett (Van Heflin), and even he is not sure why. Jeff has an insight, telling his boss that \\"even Johnny Eager has to have one friend.\\" However, when Johnny learns that Liz intends to turn herself in, he discovers the meaning of love for the first time in his life. He confesses to her that he staged the whole incident, but she does not believe him. To prove his claim, he decides to produce a live Julio, but Julio has defected to Johnny's dissatisfied partner, Bill Halligan (Cy Kendall). Johnny manages to bring Julio (at gunpoint) to Liz, but in the process he shoves Johnny and runs away. Johnny forces Liz and Courtney to flee to safety before the gunfight with Halligan and his men. Eager kills Halligan and Julio, but is spotted by a policeman as he attempts to flee and is shot down. Jeff arrives and embraces Johnny as he finally dies. The policeman, in a twist of fate, turns out to be Mae's husband.

King, Herb Alpert, Dr. John, Jaco Pastorius, Wayne Shorter, Marcus Miller, Public Enemy, and Ronnie Wood. He plays on \\"Crimson Deep\\" from the album What Lies Beneath by Finnish symphonic metal singer Tarja. He is also a member of the Stone Raiders musical band. He was voted \\"Best new drummer of 1988\\" by Modern Drummer magazine's readers' poll, then again as \\"Number one progressive drummer\\" three times (1989, 1991 & 1992). He was named \\"Best Drummer of 1990\\" by Rolling Stone magazine's critics poll.

Living Colour also won an international rock award in 1991 for Best Rock Band. In addition to drumming, Calhoun also wrote the songs \\"Pride,\\" featured on Time's Up, and \\"Nothingness\\" from Stain. Calhoun's drumming incorporates different stylistic influences and augmenting technologies. With Living Colour, he was one of the first drummers to blend advanced funk and fusion techniques with elements of hard rock and thrash metal. More recently he has integrated drum and bass grooves, ethnic percussion and sampling into his playing. He is a very physical player, with a broad vocabulary from extremely precise grooves to more free-form avant-funk and jazz approaches. He is also an avid user of the Korg Wavedrum, which allows him to integrate effects (including guitar pedals and other effects not typically associated with percussion instruments) into a single drum. Calhoun added a Mandala Drum into his setup. The Mandala is a dynamic multiple control zone electronic surface that uses sensor technology to detect where and how hard a surface strike occurs.

Antalya Province is the centre of Turkey's tourism industry, attracting 30% of foreign tourists visiting Turkey. Its capital city of the same name was the world's third most visited city by number of international arrivals in 2011, displacing New York. Antalya is Turkey's biggest international sea resort. The province of Antalya corresponds to the lands of ancient Pamphylia to the east and Lycia to the west. It features a shoreline of with beaches, ports, and ancient cities scattered throughout, including the World Heritage Site Xanthos. The provincial capital is Antalya city with a population of 1,001,318. Antalya is the fastest-growing province in Turkey; with a 4.17% yearly population growth rate between years 1990‚Äì2000, compared with the national rate of 1.83%. This growth is due to a fast rate of urbanization, particularly driven by tourism and other service sectors on the coast. Etymology The city and thus the province are named after Attalos II, king of Pergamon, who founded the city in the 2nd century BC. History Aspendos Theatre =Antiquity= Antalya has been settled since pre-historic times. Evidence of human habitation dating back to the early Paleolithic age (150,000-200,000) years has been discovered in the Karain cave, of the north of Antalya city.See and Other finds dating back to the Mesolithic (Beldibi Cave), Neolithic (Bademaƒüacƒ± H√∂y√ºƒü√º) and more recent periods show that the area has been populated by various civilizations throughout the ages. According to Herodotus, the earliest known inhabitants were a Bronze Age people called the Milyae (Milyans), who referred to the area as Milyas and spoke an Indo-European language known as Milyan. A people called the Termilae, from Crete, also settled and eventually dominated the coastal margins, which were known as TrmÃÉmis (while the Milyae became concentrated in the mountains). According to Greek legend, an exiled Athenian called Lykos (Latin: Lycus) became prominent in the region. Records from the Hittite period refer to the inhabitas and the area as Lukka, and document lively interactions with neighboring regions in the 2nd millennium BC. It is commonly accepted that Lukka is cognate with the later, latinised exonym Lycia. The Lukka were known for their seafaring skills (including piracy) and demonstrated a fiery, independent spirit; neither the Hittites, nor the Arzawa, to the west, could ever dominate them for long. According to Greek legend, there was immigration by a Greek tribe called the Akhaioi (from the in the northern Peloponnese) to the area, after the Trojan War, and eventually many Greek settlements built up along the coast and inland. In the Hellenistic period, the western parts of the later Antalya were regarded as Lycia, whereas the east was Pamphylia, and the extremes east Cilicia, while Pisidia was to the north. These communities grew into independent cities, and a eventually a federation was set up, under the name of Pamphylia. Lycian tombs in Simena Before the Ancient Roman conquest Lycia was a polity with the first democratic constitution in the world, which later partly inspired the American Constitution.U.S. Politics Online Archives: American Literature Antalya was part of the Lydian kingdom from the 7th century BC until Lydia was defeated by the Persians during the battle of Sardis in 546 BC. The Macedonian commander Alexander the Great ended Persian rule and in around 334 BC conquered the cities of the area one by one‚Äîexcept for Termessos and Sillyon which managed to repulse his armies in 333 BC. After the death of Alexander in 323 BC, a long battle erupted between his generals that lasted until 188 BC. The reign of the kingdom of Pergamon began with the defeat of the Seleucid army at Apamea. Shortly after this the city of Antalya was founded. When Attalos III, the last king of Pergamom, died in 133 BC he left his kingdom to the Ancient Romans. At this time the area is dominated by pirates based in small cities along the coast. =The Byzantines= Hƒ±dƒ±rlƒ±k Tower dating back to the Hellenistic era During the mid-Byzantine era (the 5th and 6th centuries) the city of Antalya grew beyond the city walls. From the 7th century Muslim Arabs started to be dominant in the Levant region and Antalya later played a part in the Christian Crusades against Islam. The army of Louis VII sailed from Antalya for Syria in 1148, and the fleet of Richard I of England rallied here before the conquest of Cyprus. In the late 11th and early 12th Century much of the area of the modern province fell to the Turks especially the Danishmends. From 1120 to March 1207, Antalya was again under the sovereignty of Byzantines. =The Seljuk Turks= The area was conquered by the Seljuk Turks and recaptured by the Byzantines again and again from 1076 onwards as the Seljuks strove to establish a trading base on the Mediterranean. At one stage Turkish lord Kilij Arslan had a palace here. In 1220 Byzantine rule ended for the last time and the city was quickly divided into Christian and Muslim sections, the Christian trading communities including Venetians and Genoese. Alanya also grew and throve during the Seljuk period. =The Ottoman Empire onwards= A collage of Antalya province The area passed through many hands before its final occupation by the Ottoman Empire under Murad II in 1432. Antalya also was occupied by Kingdom of Cyprus between 1361 and 1373. Ottoman rule of the coast persisted until the end of the First World War, when Antalya was briefly occupied by Italian troops before becoming part of the Republic of Turkey in 1921. There are many archaeological sites in the province including three National Parks and three Specially Protected Areas.

It was directed by David Butler. It is a Romeo and Juliet story of lovers Jack and Sally, set amidst Kentucky horseracing, in which a family feud goes back to the Civil War and is kept alive by Sally's Uncle Peter. Plot During the Civil War, Thad Goodwin Sr. (Charles Waldron) of Elmtree Farm, a local horse breeder, resists Capt. John Dillon (Douglass Dumbrille) and a company of Union soldiers confiscating his prize horses. He is killed by Dillon and his youngest son Peter (Bobs Watson) cries at the soldiers riding away with the horses. 75 years later, in 1938, Peter (Walter Brennan), now a crotchety old man, still resides on Elmtree Farm and raises horses with his niece Sally (Loretta Young). Dillon's grandson Jack (Richard Greene) and Sally meet, her not knowing that he was a Dillon. Sally's father, Thad Goodwin Jr., dies when his speculation on cotton drops. The Goodwins are forced to auction off nearly all their horses and Jack offers his services to Sally, as a trainer of their last prize horse, \\"Bessie's Boy\\", who is later injured. Sally eventually loses the farm, and Mr. Dillon makes good on his original bet with Thad Jr. and offers her any two-year-old on his farm. She picks \\"Blue Grass\\" instead of the favorite, \\"Postman\\", and Jack trains him for the Derby. She eventually learns of Jack's real identity and fires him as a trainer. During the race, Blue Grass runs neck and neck with the Dillon's horse Postman, but Blue Grass wins thanks to Jack's advice. Sally embraces Jack, but Peter collapses before the decoration ceremony and dies. At his funeral, Dillon eulogizes him and of the American life of the past, as \\"The Grand Old Man of the American Turf\\".

Biography A young Jensen Jens Jensen was born near Dybb√∏l, Denmark, on September 13, 1860, to a wealthy farming family. For the first nineteen years of his life he lived on his family's farm, which cultivated his love for the natural environment. When he was four years old, during the Second War of Schleswig in 1864, Jensen watched the Prussians invade his town, and burn his family's farm buildings. This invasion, which annexed the land into Prussia, left a deep influence on how Jensen viewed the world of man. He attended the Tune Agricultural School outside Copenhagen, afterwards undertaking mandatory service in the Prussian Army. During those three years, he sketched parks in the English and French character in Berlin and other German cities. By 1884, his military service over, Jensen was engaged to Anne Marie Hansen. Coupled with his wish to escape the family farm, this led to his decision to immigrate to the United States that year. =United States= Jensen in 1901 Initially Jensen worked in Florida, and then at Luther College in Decorah, Iowa, before moving to Chicago and taking a job as a laborer for the West Park Commission. He was soon promoted to a foreman. During this time he was allowed to design and plant a garden of exotic flowers. When the garden withered and died, he traveled into the surrounding prairie and transplanted native wildflowers. Jensen transplanted the wildflowers into a corner of Union Park, creating what became the American Garden in 1888. Working his way through the park system, Jensen was appointed superintendent of the 200 acre (800,000 m¬≤) Humboldt Park in 1895. By the late 1890s, the West Park Commission was entrenched in corruption. After refusing to participate in political graft, Jensen was ousted by a dishonest park board in 1900. He was eventually reinstated and by 1905 he was general superintendent of the entire West Park System in Chicago. His design work for the city can be seen at Garfield Park, Humboldt Park, Douglas Park, Pulaski Park, Columbus Park, The North Park Village Nature Center water fall and pond. Jensen helped establish the Forest Preserve District of Cook County, and selected many of the sites eventually acquired by the Forest Preserve District.Samuel Kling, \\"Regional Plans and Regional Plants: Jens Jensen's Vernacular Landscape and Metropolitan Planning in Chicago, 1904-1920,\\" Journal of Urban History 44.6 (November 2018): 1154-1175. He also helped establish Jens Jensen Park near his home and the Ravinia Music Festival grounds, as well as the grounds of nearby Green Bay and Ravinia elementary schools.Bruce Ingram, \\"Gorton Center celebrates career of Jens Jensen\\", Glenview Announcements (April 5, 2018) p. 14 In the 1910s, Jensen played a role in building support for the preservation of part of the Indiana Dunes sand dune ecosystem, also near Chicago, thwarting industrialization plans of J. P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie.\\"Reading 3: Beauty of the Wild\\", U.S. National Park Service, accessed April 6, 2018. =Private practice= In 1920 he retired from the park system and started his own landscape architecture practice. He worked on private estates and municipal parks throughout the U.S. He was commissioned by Eleanor and Edsel Ford for four residences, three in Michigan and one in Maine, between 1922 and 1935.Grese, Robert E., Jens Jensen, Maker of Natural Parks and Gardens. The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992. . pp. 102 Other projects included the Morse Dell Plain House and Garden (1926) at Hammond, Indiana and the William Whitaker Landscape and House (1929) at Crown Point, Indiana. A major landscape project, with Edsel Ford, was for 'Gaukler Point', the Edsel and Eleanor Ford House designed by architect Albert Kahn in 1929, on the shores of Lake St. Clair in Grosse Pointe Shores, Michigan for Edsel Ford and his wife. Jensen did the master plan and designed the estate's gardens. He employed his traditional 'long view,' giving visitors a glimpse of the residence down the long meadow after the passing the entry gates, then only brief partial views along the long drive, and only at the end revealing the entire house and another view back up the long meadow.Grese, Robert E., Jens Jensen, Maker of Natural Parks and Gardens. The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992. . pp. 102, 152, 157-58, 180, 160, 162-63, 174, 182.Grese, Robert E., Jens Jensen, Maker of Natural Parks and Gardens. The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992. . pp. 102, 160. The 'Gaukler Point' gardens and residence are now a public historical landscape and house museum and on the National Register of Historic Places. He also designed the gardens for Edsel and Eleanor's summer estate 'Skylands' in Bar Harbor on Mount Desert Island in Maine (1922).Grese, Robert E., Jens Jensen, Maker of Natural Parks and Gardens. The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992. . pp. 102, 184 Jensen did design work for their two other Michigan residences, one being 'Haven Hill,' between 1922 and 1935. 'Haven Hill', now within the Highland Recreation Area near White Lake Township in southeastern Michigan, is designated as both a Michigan State Historical Landmark and State Natural Preserve. Jensen's landscape elements, with the diversity of tree, plant and animal life, combine aesthetics, history and nature. Henry Ford Estate For Clara and Henry Ford Jensen employed his 'delayed view' approach in designing the arrival at the residence of their estate, Fair Lane, in Dearborn, Michigan. Instead of proceeding straight to the house or even seeing it, the entrance drive leads visitors through the estate's dense woodland areas. Bends in the drive, planted on the curves' inside arc with large trees give a feeling of a natural reason for the turn, and obscure any long view. Suddenly, the visitor is propelled out of the forest and in the open space where the residence is presented fully in view in front of them. This idea of wandering was one which Jens put forth in almost all of his designs. Expansive meadows and gardens make up the larger landscape, with naturalistic massings of flowers surrounding the house. The largest axial meadow, the \\"Path of the Setting Sun\\" is aligned so that on the summer solstice the setting sun glows through a precise parting of the trees at meadow's end.Grese, Robert E., Jens Jensen, Maker of Natural Parks and Gardens. The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992. . pp. 50, 100-02, 159-60, 164-65 The boathouse, with stonework cliffs designed by Jensen, allowed Henry Ford to travel on the Rouge River in his electric boat. Currently 72 acres (290,000 m¬≤) of the original estate are preserved as a historic landscape and with the house are a museum, and a National Historic Landmark. Jensen did other projects for Henry Ford including: The Dearborn Inn, Dearborn, Michigan, in 1931 (architect Albert Kahn, the first airport hotel in the country and National Historic Landmark); the Henry Ford Hospital; the Greenfield Village historic re-creation and its Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn; and the 'Ford Pavilion' at the 1933 Chicago Century of Progress Exposition. In 1923 he designed Lincoln High School in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, on a area on Lake Michigan. A number of projects with Jensen designed landscapes are listed on the National Register of Historic Places including the Jens Jensen Summer House and Studio, Rosewood Park, the May Theilgaard Watts House (architect; John S. Van Bergen), The A.G. Becker Property (architect; Howard Van Doren Shaw), The Samuel Holmes House (architect; Robert Seyfarth) and the Harold Florshiem estate (architect; Ernest Grunsfeld), all of which are located in Highland Park, Illinois where Jensen lived. Entrance to \\"The Clearing\\" In 1935, after the death of his wife, Jensen moved from Highland Park, Illinois to Ellison Bay, Wisconsin where he established The Clearing Folk School, which he called a \\"school of the soil\\" to train future landscape architects. It is now preserved as open space and an education center in the folk school tradition. In his maturity, Jensen designed Lincoln Memorial Garden in Springfield, Illinois. This plan was completed in 1935 and planted from 1936 to 1939. Jens Jensen died at his home, now The Clearing Folk School on October 1, 1951, at the age of 91. Collaborations Jens Jensen partnered with architect Howard Van Doren Shaw.Smith, S. & Mark, S. (2011). Marktown: Clayton Mark's Planned Worker Community in Northwest Indiana. South Shore Journal, 4. In the course of his long career he worked with many well known architects including Louis Sullivan, Frank Lloyd Wright, George Maher and Albert Kahn.

A version named Duplex Multi Environment Real Time (DMERT) was the operating system for the AT&T; 3B20D telephone switching minicomputer, designed for high availability; DMERT was later renamed Unix RTR (Real-Time Reliable). A generalization of Bell Labs' time-sharing operating system Unix, MERT featured a redesigned, modular kernel that was able to run Unix programs and privileged real-time computing processes. These processes' data structures were isolated from other processes with message passing being the preferred form of interprocess communication (IPC), although shared memory was also implemented. MERT also had a custom file system with special support for large, contiguous, statically sized files, as used in real-time database applications. The design of MERT was influenced by Dijkstra's THE, Hansen's Monitor, and IBM's CP-67. The MERT operating system was a four-layer design, in decreasing order of protection: * Kernel: resource allocation of memory, CPU time and interrupts * Kernel-mode processes including input/output (I/O) device drivers, file manager, swap manager, root process that connects the file manager to the disk (usually combined with the swap manager) * Operating system supervisor * User processes The standard supervisor was MERT/UNIX, a Unix emulator with an extended system call interface and shell that enabled the use of MERT's custom IPC mechanisms, although an RSX-11 emulator also existed.  Kernel and non- kernel processes  One interesting feature that DMERT ‚Äì UNIX-RTR introduced was the notion of kernel processes. This is connected with its microkernelish architecture roots. In support, there is a separate command (\`/bin/kpkill\`) rather than (\`/bin/kill\`), that is used to send signals to kernel processes. It is likely there are two different system calls also (\`kill(2)\` and \`kpkill(2)\`, the first to end a user process and the second to end a kernel process). It is unknown how much of the normal userland signaling mechanism is in place in \`/bin/kpkill\`, assuming there is a system call for it, it is not known if one can send various signals or simply send one. Also unknown is whether the kernel process has a way of catching the signals that are delivered to it. It may be that the UNIX-RTR developers implemented an entire signal and messaging application programming interface (API) for kernel processes.  File system bits  If one has root on a UNIX-RTR system, they will surely soon find that their \`ls -l\` output is a bit different than expected. Namely, there are two completely new bits in the \`drwxr-xr-x\` field. They both take place in the first column, and are \`C\` (contiguous) and \`x\` (extents). Both of these have to do with contiguous data, however one may be to do with inodes and the other with non-metadata. Example \`ls -l\` (which does not include group names, as \`ls -l\` did not used to print them). drwxr-xr-x root 64 Sun Dec 4 2003 /cft xrwxr-xr-x root 64 Mon Dec 11 2013 /no5text Crwxr- xr-x root 256 Tue Dec 12 2014 /no5data  Lucent emulator and VCDX  AT&T;, then Lucent, and now Alcatel-Lucent, are the vendor of the SPARC-based and Solaris-OEM package ATT3bem (which lives on Solaris SPARC in /opt/ATT3bem). This is a full 3B21D emulator (known as the 3B21E, the system behind the Very Compact Digital eXchange, or VCDX) which is meant to provide a production environment to the Administrative Module (AM) portion of the 5ESS switch. There are parts of the 5ESS that are not part of the 3B21D microcomputer at all: SMs and CMs. Under the emulator the workstation is referred to as the 'AW' (Administrative Workstation). The emulator installs with Solaris 2.6/SPARC and also comes with Solstice X.25 9.1 (SUNWconn), formerly known as SunLink X.25. The reason for packaging the X.25 stack with the 3B21D emulator is because the Bell System, regional Bell operating companies, and ILECs still use X.25 networks for their most critical of systems (telephone switches may live on X.25 or Datakit VCS II, a similar network developed at Bell Labs), but they do not have TCP/IP stacks). The AT&T;/Alcatel-Lucent emulator is not an easy program to get working correctly, even if one manages to have an image from a pulled working 5ESS hard disk 'dd' output file. First, there are quite a few bugs the user must navigate around in the installation process. Once this is done, there is a configuration file which connects peripherals to emulated peripherals. But there is scant documentation on the CD which describes this. The name of this file is em_devmap for SS5s, and em_devmap.ultra for Ultra60s. In addition, one of the bugs mentioned in the install process is a broken script to fdisk and image hard disks correctly: certain things need to be written to certain offsets, because the /opt/ATT3bem/bin/3bem process expects, or seems to need, these hard-coded locations. The emulator runs on SPARCstation-5s and UltraSPARC-60s. It is likely that the 3B21D is emulated faster on a modern SPARC than a 3B21D microcomputer's processor actually runs as measured in MIPS. The most difficult thing about having the emulator is acquiring a DMERT/UNIX-RTR hdd image to actually run. The operating system for the 5ESS is restricted to a few people, employees and customers of the vendor, who either work on it or write the code for it. Having an image of a running system, which can be obtained on eBay, pulled from a working 3B21D, and imaged to a file or put into an Ultra60 or SPARCstation-5, provides the resources to attempt to run the UNIX-RTR system. The uname -a output of the Bourne shell running UNIX-RTR (Real-time Reliable) is: # uname -a <3B21D> <3B21D> Though on 3B20D systems it will print 20 instead of 21, though 3B20Ds are rare, nowadays most non-VCDX 5ESSs are 3B21D hardware, not 3B20D (although they will run the software fine). The 3B20D uses the WE32000 processor while the 21 uses the WE32100. There may be some other differences, as well. One thing unusual about the processor is the direction the stack grows: up.

The contents, permissions, and owners of two files are switched in a single operation. In case of a system fault during the operation of this command, file2 will either have its original contents, permissions and owner, or will have file1's contents, permissions and owner. Thus, file2 is considered precious. File1 may be truncated in case of a system fault. RESTRICTIONS Both files must exist. Both files must reside on the same file system.

The climax features a special effects hurricane. It stars Dorothy Lamour and Jon Hall, with Mary Astor, C. Aubrey Smith, Thomas Mitchell, Raymond Massey, John Carradine, and Jerome Cowan. James Norman Hall, Jon Hall's uncle, co-wrote the novel of the same name on which The Hurricane is based. Plot As a passenger ship sails by the bleak ruins of a deserted island, Dr. Kersaint (Thomas Mitchell) blows his former home a kiss. When a fellow passenger (Inez Courtney) asks him about the place, he tells its tragic story, segueing into a flashback. During the colonial era in the South Pacific, the natives of the island of Manakoora are a contented lot. Terangi (Jon Hall), the first mate on an island-hopping schooner, marries Marama (Dorothy Lamour), the daughter of the chief (Al Kikume). She has a premonition and begs him not to leave, or at least take her with him on the ship's next voyage, but he makes her stay behind. Upon reaching Tahiti, the crew goes to a bar to celebrate. When a racist white man orders them to leave, Terangi strikes him and breaks his jaw. Unfortunately, the man has strong political connections, and the governor is forced to sentence him to six months in jail, over the objections of Terangi's captain, Nagle (Jerome Cowan). Back on Manakoora, Dr. Kersaint begs recently appointed local French Governor Eugene De Laage (Raymond Massey) to have Terangi brought home to serve his sentence under parole, but De Laage refuses to compromise his stern interpretation of the law, despite the pleas of Captain Nagle, Father Paul (C. Aubrey Smith), and even his own wife (Mary Astor). Unable to bear being confined, Terangi repeatedly tries to escape, lengthening his sentence by another 16 years, much to the delight of a particularly harsh jailer (John Carradine). Finally, after eight years, Terangi succeeds in getting out, but at a terrible price: he unintentionally kills a guard. He steals a canoe and returns to Manakoora after an arduous journey. At the end, he is rescued from his overturned canoe by Father Paul, who promises to remain silent. He is reunited with Marama and a daughter (Kuulei De Clercq) he has never seen before. Chief Mehevi recommends the family hide on a tabu island, where no one will look for them. However, De Laage discovers their preparations and commandeers the schooner to hunt them down. Terangi turns back to warn his people after he sees birds fleeing the island, an unprecedented, ominous event that Marama had dreamed about many years before. A once-in-a-lifetime hurricane strikes the island. A few, among them Dr. Kersaint and his pregnant patient, weather the disaster in a canoe, while Terangi ties his family and Madame De Laage to a stout tree. The rest drown, and the island is stripped bare. The tree floats away. Terangi later finds a war canoe in the water, which he uses to get his party to a small island. When they spot the schooner, Terangi signals it with smoke before fleeing in the canoe with his family. Governor De Laage embraces his wife, but then spots something far away through his binoculars. Madame De Laage insists it must be a floating log; suspecting Tarangi saved his wife, after a pause, he agrees with her.

Nugent praised the climactic special effect created by James Basevi, stating, \\"It is a hurricane to blast you from the orchestra pit to the first mezzanine. It is a hurricane to film your eyes with spin-drift, to beat at your ears with its thunder, to clutch at your heart and send your diaphragm vaulting over your floating rib into the region just south of your tonsils.\\" He complimented the performances of all of the principal actors with the exception of Hall, whose Terangi was described as \\"a competent Tarzan\\". Nugent also faulted the uneven pacing, but in the end, characterized the film as \\"one of the most thrilling spectacles the screen has provided this year.\\" Literary references In his memoir La tregua (\\"The Truce\\"; re-titled The Reawakening for publication in the U.S.), Primo Levi recounted his experience watching The Hurricane among other films while he was interned at a Soviet transit camp at Starye Dorogi in the aftermath of World War II. The audience of Soviet troops, former prisoners of war, and Holocaust survivors (Levi included) became more and more unruly as the movie progressed, culminating in what Levi called a \\"witches' sabbath\\" when the actual hurricane appeared on screen. A fight broke out in the cramped theater and the projectionist decided to shut off the film before the end, to Levi's dismay (he recalled the film as \\"quite a good American film of the thirties\\"). Remake A remake of this movie was released in 1979, directed by Jan Troell and starring Jason Robards Jr. and Mia Farrow.

It is based on the 1901 play and novel, both of the same name, by Justin Huntly McCarthy, and was directed by Frank Lloyd, with a screenplay adaptation by Preston Sturges.  Plot  In Paris, which is besieged by the Burgundians, Fran√ßois Villon (Ronald Colman) is the despair of Father Villon, the priest who took him in and raised him. Father Villon takes Fran√ßois to mass after his latest escapade (robbing a royal storehouse). There Fran√ßois spies a beautiful woman, Katherine DeVaucelles (Frances Dee). Entranced, he tries to strike up an acquaintance with her, reciting some of his poetry to her. On the surface, she is unmoved, but when soldiers come to take him into custody, she provides him with an alibi. King Louis XI of France (Basil Rathbone) is in desperate straits. He suspects that there is a traitor in his court. He goes in disguise to a tavern to see who accepts an intercepted coded message from the enemy. While there, he is amused by the antics of poet Fran√ßois Villon. The rascal criticizes the king and brags about how much better he would do if he were in Louis' place. The traitor is revealed to be Grand Constable D'Aussigny (John Miljan), but before he can be arrested, the turncoat is killed in a brawl by Villon. The King is now of two minds about what to do, since the traitor has been revealed by Villon. As a jest, Louis rewards Villon by making him the new Constable, though the king secretly intends to have him executed after a week. His low-born origin kept a secret, Villon falls in love with lady-in-waiting Katherine DeVaucelles and she with him, not recognizing him as Villon. Then Louis informs Villon about his grim fate. Soon Fran√ßois finds out how difficult it is to make the army attack the besieging forces, even after he has the king's storehouses release the army's last six months of food to the starving population of Paris-- giving the army the same short schedule for attack as the people. Villon finally escapes the palace, but when the Burgundians break down the city gates, he rallies the common people to rout them and lift the siege. He is then arrested again. The king has had to put up with Villon's impudence, but he and Villon now have some grudging respect for each other, with Villon admitting to the king that Louis' job is harder than he had thought. The king on his side has been convinced by Katherine and Father Villon of Fran√ßois's role in saving the city, and now feels obligated to reward him again. But wanting less aggravation in his life, Louis decides to pardon Villon, but exile him from Paris. Villon is supposed to see Katherine on his way out, but decides to bypass her. This does no good. Fran√ßois leaves on foot, headed for the south of France. Lady Katherine squeezes this information from Father Villon and follows with a guard in her carriage at a discreet distance on the road, waiting for Fran√ßois to tire out.

Goodman * Music, Original Score - Richard Hageman * Sound, Recording - Loren L. Ryder Hans Drier was also nominated for an Academy Award for his work on the 1930 film The Vagabond King, which was a musical version of the same story.  Other versions  There is no connection, apart from the title, between the story and the 1852 comic opera by Adolphe Adam called Si j'√©tais roi (English: If I Were King). McCarthy's play premiered on Broadway in 1901 and was revived five times up through 1916. It was first adapted in 1920 as a silent film. In 1925, composer Rudolf Friml and librettists Brian Hooker and W.H. Post turned it into a successful Broadway operetta, The Vagabond King, which featured the songs \\"Only a Rose\\", \\"Some Day\\", and \\"Song of the Vagabonds\\". The operetta was filmed twice - in 1930, starring Jeanette MacDonald and Dennis King and in 1956, directed by Michael Curtiz. Both film versions used only a little of Friml's original score. The Fran√ßois Villon story was also filmed in 1927 under the title The Beloved Rogue, with John Barrymore in the lead role. The film was adapted as a radio play on Lux Radio Theater October 16, 1939 with Douglas Fairbanks Jr.. Academy Award Theater adapted it on May 11, 1946 with Colman reprising his part. Popular Tamil actor-turned-politician M.G. Ramachandran, after watching and being inspired by this movie, decided to act, produce and direct Nadodi Mannan (English: The Vagabond King) in 1958, which turned out to be a huge milestone in his career, paving the way for him to become Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu 19 years later.

C. Wren, which details the adventures of three English brothers who enlist separately in the French Foreign Legion following the theft of a valuable jewel from the country house of a relative. Published in 1924, the novel is set in the period before World War I. It has been adapted for the screen several times. Plot summary Michael \\"Beau\\" Geste is the protagonist (and an archetype). The main narrator is his younger brother John. The three Geste brothers are portrayed as behaving according to the English upper class values of a time gone by, and \\"the decent thing to do\\" is, in fact, the leitmotif of the novel. The Geste brothers are orphans and have been brought up by their aunt Lady Patricia at Brandon Abbas. The rest of Beau's band are mainly Isobel and Claudia (possibly the illegitimate daughter of Lady Patricia) and Lady Patricia's relative Augustus (the caddish nephew of the absent Sir Hector Brandon). While not mentioned in Beau Geste, the American Otis Vanbrugh appears as a friend of the Geste brothers in a sequel novel. John and Isobel are devoted to each other and it is in part to spare her any suspicion of being a thief that he takes the extreme step of joining the French Foreign Legion (following the steps of his elder brothers). The detonator of the main plot is the disappearance of a precious jewel known as the \\"Blue Water\\". Suspicion falls on the band of young people, and Beau leaves England to join the French Foreign Legion in Algeria, followed by his brothers, Digby (his twin) and John. After recruit training in Sidi Bel Abbes and some active service skirmishing with tribesmen in the south, Beau and John are posted to the small garrison of the fictional desert outpost of Fort Zinderneuf, while Digby and his American friends Hank and Buddy are sent to Tanout-Azzal to train with a mule mounted company. The commander at Fort Zinderneuf (after the death of two more senior officers) is the sadistic Sergeant Major Lejaune, who drives his abused subordinates to the verge of mutiny. An attack by Tuaregs prevents mass desertion (only the Geste brothers and a few loyalists are against the scheme). Throughout the book, Beau's behaviour is true to France and the Legion, and he dies at his post. Digby, Hank and Buddy arrive with a relief column from Tokotu that reaches Fort Zinderneuf too late. Together with John (the last man standing at Zinderneuf) they desert and experience a long trek during which Digby is killed in a skirmish with Arabs. After becoming separated from his friends Hank and Buddy in the desert, John returns to Brandon Abbas. The last survivor of the three brothers, he is welcomed by their aunt and his fianc√©e Isobel. The reason for the jewel theft is revealed to have been a matter of honour, and to have been the only \\"decent thing\\" possible. In Beau Ideal and other sequels P. C. Wren ties loose strings together, including recording that Michael Geste's original reasons for joining the Foreign Legion were honour but also his doomed and impossible love for Claudia. Title The phrase \\"beau geste\\" () is from the French, meaning \\"a gracious (or fine) gesture\\".Definition at Dictionary.com In French, the phrase includes the suggestion of a fine gesture with unwelcome or futile consequences, and an allusion to the chanson de geste, a literary poem celebrating the legendary deeds of a hero.Definition at Dictionary.com Sequels P. C. Wren wrote the sequels Beau Sabreur (in which the narrator is a French officer of Spahis who plays a secondary role in Beau Geste) and Beau Ideal. In this third volume Wren details what happened the night of the theft of the Blue Water. He also wrote Good Gestes, a collection of short tales (about half of them about the Geste brothers and their American friends Hank and Buddy, who also feature prominently in Beau Sabreur and Beau Ideal) and Spanish Maine (UK) (The Desert Heritage (USA)), where loose ends are tied up and the successive tales of John Geste's adventures come to an end. Life in the Foreign Legion is also represented in some, but not all, of Wren's subsequent novels: Port O'Missing Men, Soldiers of Misfortune, Valiant Dust, Dead Men's Boots, Flawed Blades, The Wages of Virtue, Stepsons of France, and The Uniform of Glory.Wren, P.

The Desert Heritage, Houghton- Mifflin, 1935 Analysis The original novel, on which the various films are more or less loosely based, provides a detailed and fairly authentic description of life in the pre-1914 Foreign Legion, which has led to (unproven) suggestions that P. C. Wren himself served with the Legion.

Though it is commonly placed in the subfamily Buteoninae, the validity of this group is doubtful and currently under review. Description Jordanal - El Valle, Panama Adult Pseudastur albicollis costaricensis in Honduras Adult Pseudastur albicollis ghiesbreghti The adult white hawk ranges from 46‚Äì56 cm (18‚Äì22 in) long with very broad wings and has a white head, body and underwings. The upper wings are black, and the very short tail is black with a broad white band. The bill is black and the legs are yellow. The sexes are similar, but females are larger and heavier‚Äî840 g (1.85 lb) compared to the male's 650 g (1.43 lb). Immature birds have extensive black spotting on the upperparts and dark-streaked whitish underparts. The call of the white hawk is a plaintive kerwee. =Subspecies= There are four subspecies: * Pseudastur albicollis ghiesbreghti - Southern Mexico to Nicaragua :Entirely white, except for black markings on the outer primaries, and a black sub-terminal tail bar. The eyes are yellow. * Pseudastur albicollis costaricensis - Honduras to Panama and Colombia. :Similar to ghiesbreghti but with more distinct black markings on the wings and tail. The eyes are brown. * Pseudastur albicollis williaminae - Locally in north-western Colombia and western Venezuela. :Wing feathers are more heavily marked with black, and it has black streaks on the crown and collar. The tail band is broader and the eyes are brown. * Pseudastur albicollis albicollis - Northern Colombia and central Venezuela to Brazil. :Smaller than the northern forms and the wings are mostly black, with white markings. The black tail band extends to the base of the tail and the eyes are brown. All subspecies look mainly white from below. The identity of the birds discovered in 2000/2001 in the Serran√≠a de las Quinchas of central Colombia Laverde-R. et al. (2005) is unclear. Distribution and ecology This is a bird of lowland forest and other woodlands. It ranges from southern Mexico through Central and South America to Peru, Bolivia and Brazil. It also breeds on Trinidad. The white hawk's range in central South America is the entire Amazon basin, from the Andes on the west to the Guianas on the Atlantic on the northeast, and to the transition lands to the south. A widespread species, it is usually not common, but the IUCN considers it not to be globally threatened due to the large extent of its range. The white hawk feeds mainly on reptiles with some insects and mammals, caught in a sortie from a perch. It associates with foraging groups of tufted capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) and South American coatis (Nasua nasua) to snatch prey startled by these animals.de Mello Beisiegel (2007) This species is often seen soaring, and has a spectacular aerial courtship display. It builds a large stick platform nest in a treeE.g. Ceiba sp.: Cisneros-Heredia (2006) and usually lays one dark-blotched blue-white egg. An attended nest was observed in Ecuador in mid-August.Cisneros-Heredia (2006) Footnotes  References  * Cisneros-Heredia, Diego F.

The Cessna 400, marketed as the Cessna TTx, is a single-engine, fixed-gear, low- wing general aviation aircraft built from composite materials by Cessna Aircraft. The Cessna 400 was originally built by Columbia Aircraft as the Columbia 400.Collins, Richard: \\"Lancair Columbia\\", Flying, September 2005, pages 46‚Äì52. Hachette Filipacchi Media US Inc. ISSN 0015-4806 From 2013, the aircraft was built as the Cessna TTx Model T240. Cessna 400 production was ended in February 2018. Design and development The Cessna 400 was derived from the normally aspirated Columbia 300, which in turn was derived from the Lancair ES kit aircraft. The 400 is powered by a turbocharged Continental TSIO-550-C engine producing 310 horsepower (230 kW) at 2600 rpm. The 400 features a Garmin G1000 glass cockpit that was later incorporated into the 300 to create the Cessna 350. The 400's Continental TSIO-550-C engine is capable of being operated lean of peak. Measured in flight at 11,000 feet (3355 m), 50 F¬∞ (28 C¬∞) rich of peak turbine inlet temperature, maximum cruise yielded true air speed and per hour fuel flow. At the same operating parameters and 50‚Äì75 ¬∞F lean of peak the 400 was measured at TAS and /hr (106.8 lb/hr, 67.6 l/hr).Collins, Richard: \\"Columbia 400 With G1000 Autopilot and All\\", Flying, August 2006, pages 86‚Äì91. Hachette Filipacchi Media US Inc. ISSN 0015-4806 In a 2006 review, Richard L. Collins of Flying magazine said of the 400: The Columbia 400 was marketed with an optional ice protection system, known as E-Vade that was not certified for flight into known icing. The system consists of heat-conducting graphite foil panels on the wing and tail leading edges. These panel areas are heated by 70 volt 100 amp electrical power delivered from a dedicated alternator. The system is controlled by a single switch. The 400 features optional speedbrakes mounted on the wing's top surfaces. The 400 nosewheel is not directly steerable; directional control while taxiing is accomplished using differential braking on the mainwheels.A Tale of Two Cessnas, Flying Magazine, Vol. 135., No. 5, May 2008, p. 30 Initially sold simply as the Cessna 400, the aircraft was given the marketing name Corvalis TT for twin turbocharged by Cessna on 14 January 2009. The name is a derivation of the town of Corvallis, Oregon which is west of the Bend, Oregon location of the Cessna plant that built the aircraft, prior to closing the plant and relocating production to Independence, Kansas in 2009. In April 2009 Cessna announced that it would close the Bend, Oregon factory where the Cessna 400 was produced and move production to Independence, Kansas, with the composite construction moved to Mexico. The production line was restarted in October, 2009 in the Cessna Independence paint facility, at a rate of one aircraft per six months initially. This was to allow the new workers, plus the 30 employees transferred from Bend, to gain experience and also allow Cessna the opportunity to retail its unsold inventory of Cessna 350s and 400s. At that time the company anticipated moving the 350/400 production to a permanent facility by the end of 2009. In December 2010 a Cessna 400 that was being test flown by an FAA test pilot at the factory developed a fuel leak, the cause of which was determined to be that the aircraft had \\"suffered a significant structural failure in the wing during a production acceptance flight test. The wing skin disbonded from the upper forward wing spar. The length of the disbond was approximately 7 feet.\\" As a result, the FAA issued an Emergency Airworthiness Directive affecting seven Cessna 400s and one 350, all on the production line. The AD did not affect any customer aircraft in service, but did delay deliveries. In September 2011 the Federal Aviation Administration proposed a US$2.4M fine against the company for its failure to follow quality assurance requirements while producing fiberglass components at its plant in Chihuahua, Mexico. Excess humidity meant that the parts did not cure correctly and quality assurance did not detect the problems. The FAA also discovered 82 other aircraft parts that had been incorrectly made and not detected by the company's quality assurance. On 29 March 2011 Cessna unveiled several improvements to the Cessna 400 at Sun 'n Fun, designating the new variant the TTx. The aircraft has not been selling well since the late-2000s recession started, with 110 delivered in 2008, the first year Cessna produced the model, 41 in 2009 and just seven sold in 2010. The improved aircraft features a new glass cockpit panel, designed by Cessna and based on the Garmin G2000. Called Intrinzic, it features two wide high definition displays and a touchscreen controller that uses an infra-red grid to accept touch commands. The updated model also has dual Attitude and Heading Reference Systems, a GFC 700 autopilot, a Garmin GTS800 traffic avoidance system, Garmin GTX 33ES transponder with ADS-B and the Garmin Electronic Stability Protection System, which protects the aircraft from operations outside the approved flight envelope. The new TTx model has no traditional instruments and instead employs the L-3 Trilogy as a back-up. The TTx also features a built-in pulse oximeter, a new paint scheme and a new interior. By the end of Sun 'n Fun 2011 the company indicated it had sold 16 of the new TTx model. At Sun 'n Fun in March 2012 the company announced that a flight-into-known icing package would be an option on the TTx model. The system will provide up to 2.5 hours icing protection. The design's production came to an end in February 2018. Sales of the model had been poor, with only 23 examples sold in 2017, compared to its main competitor, the Cirrus SR22, which sold 309 models that same year. =Weights= The 400's maximum take-off weight is 3600 lbs (1633 kg) and the maximum landing weight is 3420 lbs (1551 kg). A typical empty weight without deicing equipment is 2575 lbs (1168 kg). With a full fuel load this leaves 413 lbs (187 kg) for crew and baggage. =Certification= The aircraft was originally certified by the Federal Aviation Administration under FAR 23, on April 8, 2004 as the Model LC41-550FG (for Lancair Certified, Model 41, Continental 550 engine, Fixed Gear) and marketed under the designation Columbia 400. EASA certification was added in February 2009. The Cessna 400 is certified in the Utility Category, with a positive limit maneuvering load factor of 4.4, whereas most comparable aircraft (such as the Cessna 182 and Cirrus SR22) were certified in the Normal Category with a load factor of 3.8. The 400 has a certified airframe maximum life of 25,200 flight hours.

It was not carried. General background After World War II, membership of the Communist Party had peaked at around 20,000 and Fred Paterson had won the seat of Bowen in the 1944 Queensland state election. Communists became prominent in trade unions as well as cultural and literary circles. Following the nationalisation of Australian Banks in 1948, Opposition Leader Robert Menzies became concerned that communist ideas were infiltrating the Labor Party. A Queensland rail strike in that same year cemented that idea. Menzies vowed that if elected he would outlaw communism. = 1949 federal election campaign = In the 1949 general election, the newly formed Liberal Party campaigned on a strongly anti-communist, anti-interventionist platform, which targeted the Labor Government's attempt to nationalise banking in Australia, as well as what Menzies considered to be a growing communist threat in the wake of World War II. On 27 June 1949, coal miners went out on strike, supported by the Communist Party of Australia and various unions. Bargaining quickly broke down between the unions and government and on 1 August, Prime Minister Chifley sent in troops from the Australian Armed Forces to run the mines until the dispute was resolved. By its fourth day, the Sydney docks were congested with coal ships unable to leave the port, the loading of ships being severely delayed by restricted transport. By 1 July the government was examining the possibility of importing coal from Britain. The strike lasted another 2 weeks, until 15 August. Later that year, PM Chifley also brought in legislation to begin the rationing of petrol. Both of these events became key issues in the 1949 federal election campaign. During the campaign, Menzies asserted that socialism was the \\"outstanding issue\\" of the day. He accused the Labor Party of having communist leanings, citing as proof its banking legislation and regulation in other areas of the economy. \\"A vote for labour,\\" he suggested, \\"is a vote for the socialist objective.\\" Socialism was, according to Menzies, detrimental to the freedom and prosperity of the nation, and to be considered a real and prominent threat to the Australian way of life. In December 1949, the Liberal Party with Robert Menzies as Prime Minister won a majority in the House of Representatives with 74 of 121 seats. = The Communist Party Dissolution Act = On 23 June 1950, the Communist Party Dissolution Bill (1950) was introduced. In his speech introducing the Bill, PM Menzies read out the names of 53 members of the Communist Party of Australia, referring to them as a \\"traitorous minority\\" which threatened the security of the nation. The Bill passed the House of Representatives, but struggled to pass the Senate, which had a Labor party majority. Labor senators agreed that the Communist Party should be dissolved, but held reservations about allowing the Governor-General to 'declare' people communists. These reservations were especially strong after Menzies admitted that the names of Communist Party members which had been read out on the House floor contained errors. Amendments were proposed that removed this power, but the Labor Party later withdrew its opposition and the Bill passed the Senate without amendments on 19 October 1950. It was brought into effect as the Communist Party Dissolution Act (1950) on 20 October 1950. The Act authorised the Governor-General to declare any person a communist, engaging or likely to engage in activities detrimental to the defence and security of the nation. Such persons were not allowed to be employed by the Commonwealth in public service, or in industries considered vital to the defence of Australia. They were not permitted to run for office and were prohibited from joining a union. The Communist Party of Australia was declared an unlawful organisation and was dissolved, its property forfeited to the Commonwealth without compensation. Affiliated organisations were also liable to be declared unlawful, at the discretion of the Governor-General. =Australian Communist Party v. Commonwealth (1951) = Immediately following the passage of the Act, a challenge was filed in the High Court. The case was heard beginning on 14 November 1950 by the Full Bench of seven judges. The question was whether the federal government had the power, under the defence power (section 51.vi) of the Australian Constitution. The Constitution, in Section 51, gives the Parliament power to make legislation in regard to \\"(vi) the naval and military defence of the Commonwealth and of the several States, and the control of the forces to execute and maintain the laws of the Commonwealth.\\" The Commonwealth claimed that the Act was valid under this power because communists presented a real threat to Australian security, as revolution was a central theme of Marxist doctrine.. On 19 March 1951, the Court ruled in a 6:1 judgement (Latham CJ dissenting) that the Act was invalid. In his judgement, Fullagar J summarised the position of the bench thusly, > \\"The validity of a law or of an administrative act done under a law cannot > be made to depend on the opinion of the law-maker, or the person who is to > do the act, that the law or the consequence of the act is within the > constitutional power upon which the law in question itself depends for its > validity. A power to make laws with respect to lighthouses does not > authorize the making of a law with respect to anything which is, in the > opinion of the law-maker, a lighthouse. A power to make a proclamation > carrying legal consequences with respect to a lighthouse is one thing: a > power to make a similar proclamation with respect to anything which in the > opinion of the Governor-General is a lighthouse is another thing.‚Äù Referendum  A referendum was called on 23 August 1951, which sought to insert a clause into the constitution that empowered the Federal Parliament make laws in reference to communism and communists. Newspaper editorials were overwhelmingly in favour of the ban with 12 editorials in support, two papers not taking a stance (Daily Mirror and Daily News), and just one newspaper against it (The Argus). The Labor party had decided to campaign for a 'No' vote despite supporting the Bill through the senate the previous year. Opposition Leader HV Evatt held more speeches than Menzies and started campaigning earlier, campaigning vigorously against what he perceived as Menzies' attempt to establish a police state in Australia. Menzies' speeches were often interrupted by the No campaign's hecklers, although Menzies claimed to have been happy with the uproar because it demonstrated the communists' \\"disrespect for liberal norms\\". Some Liberal party members and non-affiliated conservatives also supported the 'No' campaign, which undermined Menzies efforts to convince the public that this was a necessary measure. Despite this, three months before the ballot, the ban was supported by 73.3% percent of respondents in a Gallup Poll. The reason behind the Gallup support plummeting for Yes has been estimated to have been especially middle class Liberal voters slipping away from the Coalition position, whereas Labor kept their ranks better. Bi-partisan support was usually required for constitutional amendments to pass in Australia. The referendum was held on 22 September 1951. The question which appeared on the ballot was: Do you approve of the proposed law for the alteration of the Constitution entitled 'Constitution Alteration (Powers to deal with Communists and Communism) 1951'? The referendum was not carried. =Results= { class=wikitable + Result Handbook of the 44th Parliament (2014) . ----- ! align=\\"left\\" rowSpan=\\"2\\"  State  align=\\"right\\" rowSpan=\\"2\\"  On rolls ! align=\\"right\\" rowSpan=\\"2\\"  Ballots issued ! align=\\"middle\\" colSpan=\\"2\\"  For ! align=\\"middle\\" colSpan=\\"2\\"  Against ! align=\\"right\\" rowSpan=\\"2\\"  Invalid ----- ! align=\\"middle\\" Vote  align=\\"middle\\"  % ! align=\\"middle\\" Vote  align=\\"middle\\"  % -----  New South Wales  align=\\"right\\"  1,944,219  align=\\"right\\"  1,861,147  align=\\"right\\"  865,838  align=\\"middle\\"  47.17%  align=\\"right\\"  969,868   align=\\"right\\"  25,441 -----  Victoria  align=\\"right\\"  1,393,556  align=\\"right\\"  1,326,024  align=\\"right\\"  636,819  align=\\"middle\\"  48.71%  align=\\"right\\"  670,513   align=\\"right\\"  18,692 -----  Queensland  align=\\"right\\"  709,328  align=\\"right\\"  675,916  align=\\"right\\"  373,156   align=\\"right\\"  296,019  align=\\"middle\\"  44.24%  align=\\"right\\"  6,741 -----  South Australia  align=\\"right\\"  442,983  align=\\"right\\"  427,253  align=\\"right\\"  198,971  align=\\"middle\\"  47.29%  align=\\"right\\"  221,763   align=\\"right\\"  6,519 -----  Western Australia  align=\\"right\\"  319,383  align=\\"right\\"  305,653  align=\\"right\\"  164,989   align=\\"right\\"  134,497  align=\\"middle\\"  44.91%  align=\\"right\\"  6,167 -----  Tasmania  align=\\"right\\"  164,868  align=\\"right\\"  158,596  align=\\"right\\"  78,154   align=\\"right\\"  77,349  align=\\"middle\\"  49.74%  align=\\"right\\"  3,093 -----  Armed Forces*  align=\\"right\\"   align=\\"right\\"  9,472  align=\\"right\\"  6,478  align=\\"middle\\"   align=\\"right\\"  2,917  align=\\"middle\\"   align=\\"right\\"  82 -----  Total for Commonwealth  noWrap align=\\"right\\"  4,974,337  noWrap align=\\"right\\"  4,754,589  noWrap align=\\"right\\"  2,317,927  noWrap align=\\"middle\\"  49.44%  noWrap align=\\"right\\"  2,370,009   noWrap align=\\"right\\"  66,653 -----  colSpan=\\"8\\"  Obtained majority in three States and an overall minority of 52 082 votes. -----  align=\\"right\\" colSpan=\\"8\\"  Not carried } * Armed forces totals are also included in their respective states.

The original edition appeared in the 1917‚Äì1919 issues of the Archiv f√ºr Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik. Marianne Weber, his wife, published the essays as Part Three of his Gesammelte Aufsatze zur Religionssoziologie in 1920‚Äì1921. An English translation was made in 1952 and several editions were released since then. It was his fourth and last major work on the sociology of religion, after The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism and The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism. In this work he attempts to explain the factors that were responsible for the early differences between Oriental and Occidental religiosity.Reinhard Bendix, Max Weber: an intellectual portrait, University of California Press, 1977, page 200. It is especially visible when the mysticism developed by Western Christianity is compared with the asceticism that flourished within the religious traditions of India. Weber's premature death in 1920 prevented him from following Ancient Judaism with his planned analysis of the Psalms, the Book of Job, Rabbinic Judaism, early Christianity and Islam. Weber wrote that Weber notes that Judaism not only fathered Christianity and Islam, but was crucial to the rise of the modern Western world, as its influence was important as those of Hellenistic and Greco-Roman civilizations. Types of asceticism and the significance of ancient Judaism Weber noted that some aspects of Christianity sought to conquer and change the world, instead of withdrawing from its imperfections. This fundamental distinctiveness of Christianity (when compared to Eastern religions) stems originally from ancient Jewish prophecy. Weber stated his reasons for investigating ancient Judaism: History and social organization of Ancient Israel Weber analysed the interaction between the Bedouins, the cities, the herdsmen and the peasants, the conflicts between them, and the rise and fall of United Monarchy of Israel and Judah. The brief time of United Monarchy divided the period of confederacy since the Exodus and the settlement of the Israelites in Canaan from the period of political decline following the division of the monarchy.Reinhard Bendix, Max Weber: an intellectual portrait, University of California Press, 1977, p.213 Weber discusses the organisation of the early confederacy, the unique qualities of Israelite relations to the God of Israel, the influence of foreign cults, types of religious ecstasy and the struggle of the priests against ecstasy and idol worship. Later he describes the times of the Division of the Monarchy, social aspects of Biblical prophecy, social orientation of the prophets, demagogues and pamphleteers, ecstasy and politics, ethic and theodicity of the Prophets. Those periods were significant for religious history, as the basic doctrines of Judaism that left their mark on Western civilisation arose during those times.

Original  Originally, rhinestones were rock crystals gathered from the river Rhine, hence the name, although some were also found in areas like the Alps, but today the name \\"rhinestone\\" applies only to varieties of lead glass known as crystal glass. The availability was greatly increased in the 18th century when the Alsatian jeweller Georg Friedrich Strass had the idea to imitate diamonds by coating the lower side of lead glass with metal powder. Hence, rhinestones are called strass in many European languages. As opposed to the classic rhinestones, which had a metal powder coating on the bottom side only, several companies have opted to mass-produce iridescent lead glass, by reducing the metal coating thickness and applying it uniformly, not using metal powder with a binder but by applying various forms of metal deposition (thin foil, vapor deposition, etc): Favrile glass by Tiffany in 1894, Carnival glass under the name \\"Iridrill\\" by Fenton in 1908, \\"Aurora Borealis\\" glass by Swarovski in 1956 and PVD-coated dichroic glass in the late 20th century, amongst many other decorative lead glasses coated with a thin metal layer sold under various commercial names such as \\"rainbow glass\\", \\"aurora glass\\" and such. Rhinestones can be used as imitations of diamonds, and some manufacturers even manage to partially reproduce the glistening effect real diamonds have in the sun.  Compositions  Typically, crystal rhinestones have been used on costumes, apparel and jewelry. Crystal rhinestones are produced mainly in Austria by Swarovski and in the Czech Republic by Preciosa and a few other glassworks in northern Bohemia. In the US, these are sometimes called \\"Austrian crystal\\". The rhinestone-studded Nudie suit was invented by Nudie Cohn in the 1940s, an Americanization of the matador's \\"suit of lights\\". Rhinestone material is often used as an alternative to sequin.  In popular culture  Liberal use of rhinestones was associated with country music singers, as well as with singer Elvis Presley and pianist Liberace. In 1974 David Allan Coe released the album The Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy and referred to himself as The Rhinestone Cowboy again in the 1977 song \\"Longhaired Redneck\\". In 1975 Glen Campbell had a top hit with the song \\"Rhinestone Cowboy\\" and became known as the \\"Rhinestone Cowboy\\". That song served as the basis for the 1984 movie Rhinestone, starring Sylvester Stallone and Dolly Parton. The British virtual band Gorillaz has also released a single by the name of \\"Rhinestone Eyes\\" in 2010. The closing track on Madvillain's Madvillainy is called Rhinestone Cowboy. Sizing guide Rhinestones are sized by using the term \\"ss\\", or stone size, followed by a number to indicate size (e.g. 8ss is equivalent to 2.3 mm diameter, 10ss is 2.8 mm). SS is more commonly used for apparel means, while PP (or pearl plate) is used for jewelry. Hot-fix rhinestones Hot-fix rhinestones, also called heat- transfer rhinestones, are mainly used for apparel. The flat bottom of the stone has a glue backing and, when heated, melts onto the surface of the clothing. These can be adhered using a regular iron, although it is recommended to use a heat press, as they are able to reach higher temperatures (standard transfers require temperatures of up to ) while applying heavy pressures resulting in a more professional quality.

An example is the interior of a storage tank, occasionally entered by maintenance workers but not intended for human occupancy. Hazards in a confined space often include harmful dust or gases, asphyxiation, submersion in liquids or free-flowing granular solids (for example, grain bins), electrocution, or entrapment.BP International Ltd. Confined Space Entry, Institution of Chemical Engineers 2005 pp. 1-14 A confined space warning sign on process equipment. Confined space accidents are of particular concern in occupational safety and health due to the hazards that they pose to the victim and subsequently to a rescue team. Confined space training outlines the skills and protocols for safe entry to confined spaces, and includes precautions such as locking and tagging out connecting piping, testing of breathable air quality, forced ventilation, observation of workers in the space, and a predetermined rescue plan with appropriate safety harnesses and other rescue equipment standing by.  Description  Although the definition of a confined space varies between jurisdictions, it is generally recognized as a space that: * has limited or restricted means of entry or exit; * is large enough for a person to enter to perform tasks; * is not designed or configured for continuous occupancy; A utility tunnel, the inside of a boiler (only accessible when the boiler is off), the inside of a fluid storage tank, a septic tank that has contained sewage, and a small underground electrical vault are all examples of confined spaces. Ships and other vessels commonly have confined spaces due to the need for compartmentalized watertight construction.Entering enclosed spaces on a ship at Marine Insight The exact definition of a confined space varies depending on the type of industry. Until recently confined spaces on a construction site were defined differently than confined spaces in General Industry such as a paper mill. That changed due to a new confined space regulation for construction. Confined spaces that present special hazards to workers, including risks of toxic or asphyxiant gas accumulation, fires, falls, flooding, and entrapment may be classified as permit-required confined spaces depending on the nature and severity of the hazard. Even normally habitable parts of a building such as corridors or offices may take on the characteristics of a confined space, during operations that alter normal ventilation and access. For example, a room may be wrapped in plastic sheeting for painting and any vapor emitted in the room may not be dispersed by blocked ventilation ducts. But these areas would not be defined as confined space by OSHA. In the United States, entry into permit-required confined spaces must comply with regulations promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). These regulations include developing a written program, issuing entry permits, assigning attendant(s), designating entrants, and ensuring a means of rescue. According to the OSHA, a permit- required confined space (permit space) has the three characteristics listed above (which define a confined space) and one or more of the following: # Contains or has the potential to contain a hazardous atmosphere # Contains a material that has the potential for engulfing the entrant # Has an internal configuration that might cause an entrant to be trapped or asphyxiated by inwardly converging walls or by a floor that slopes downward and tapers to a smaller cross section # Contains any other recognized serious safety or health hazards. In addition to the hazards posed by the design of the space, work activities can also pose serious safety hazards (heat, noise, vapors, etc.) that must be taken into account when identifying safety measures that must be taken.  Atmospheric hazards  The most common hazard seen in confined spaces is that of atmospheric hazards. These affect air quality and present immediate hazards to health or life. Acceptable atmospheric conditions must be verified before entry, and must be monitored continuously while the space is occupied. The oxygen concentration, the presence of toxic gases, and flammable material are the three conditions that must be monitored. According to OSHA, oxygen concentration is considered safe if it is between 19.5% and 23.5% of the total atmosphere. To protect against toxic gases, contaminants have permissible exposure limits (PELs), which are set by OSHA. Work also cannot continue if the concentration of a material reaches or exceeds 10% of its lower explosive limit. Even if a tank or similar vessel initially is tested and found to contain breathable air, a hazard can develop during operations inside the tank if residues inside the tank can release toxic gas or vapor when disturbed or if accidentally ignited. Steel water tanks may have dangerously low oxygen concentration when the interior rusts.Trevor Kletz What Went Wrong:Case Histories of Process Plant Disasters, Fourth Edition, Elsevier, 1999 Chapter 11 \\"Entry into Vessels\\"  Entry certification  In many situations, certification of non-hazardous atmosphere by a trained or competent person is required before personnel may enter a confined space without the use of a respirator. In the United States Navy, that person is the designated shipboard gas-free engineer. In the maritime sector an NFPA Certified Marine Chemist is required to perform testing in all confined spaces that have contained a flammable, combustible or toxic substance. Certification in civilian settings can be performed by any employee who is trained and authorized by the employer. The Entry Supervisor, under OSHA regulations, is designated by the employer and ensures that the space is safe to enter and all hazards are controlled. In the United States, agricultural operations are exempted from regulations governing permit-required confined spaces (which is specific to general industry), but they are still required to identify and control confined space hazards.  Injuries and fatalities  Injuries and fatalities involving confined spaces are frequent and often involve successive fatalities when would-be rescuers succumb to the same problem as the initial victim. In the 1980s, approximately 60% of fatalities involve would-be rescuers and more than 30% of fatalities occur in a space that has been tested and found to be safe to enter. One example was in 2006 at the decommissioned Sullivan Mine in British Columbia, Canada when one initial victim and then three rescuers all died. Accidents in confined spaces present unique challenges and are often catastrophic, such as the Xcel Energy Cabin Creek Fire in 2007. In 1999, North West OHS released a study of confined space fatalities based on reports from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), National Institute of Occupational Safety Health (NIOSH) and the Mines Safety and Health Administration (MHSA) with a breakdown of their causes. Researchers believe that the following numbers are only a fraction of the fatal confined space accidents that actually occurred as many locations are not initially identified as confined spaces, OSHA reports did not include non-hazardous confined space fatalities in their studies prior to 1982, NIOSH still do not include non-hazardous confined space fatalities in their studies and many American states do not note the presence of confined spaces in fatality reports submitted to OSHA. *Fire and Explosion (OSHA 1982a): 50 confined space incidents from 1974 to 1979 with 76 fatalities. The majority of incidents were caused by worker error or faulty equipment. *Lockout-tagout (OSHA 1982b): 83 confined space incidents from 1974 to 1980 with 83 fatalities. This category covers conveyor belts and machinery on the factory floor etc. that are not generally considered confined spaces, but which satisfy the criteria for a confined space. *Grain Handling (OSHA 1983): 105 confined space incidents from 1977 to 1981 with 126 fatalities. *Toxic and Asphyxiating Atmospheres (OSHA 1985): 122 confined space incidents from 1974 to 1982 with 173 fatalities. *Welding and Cutting (OSHA 1988): 217 incidents from 1974 to 1985 with 262 fatalities. OSHA reports of welding and cutting deaths do not record whether or not an incident has occurred in a confined space, it is estimated that 22% of the incidents were in a confined space. *Shipbuilding & Repair (OSHA 1990): 151 incidents from 1974 to 1984 with 176 fatalities. OSHA reports of shipbuilding deaths do not record whether or not an incident has occurred in a confined space, it is estimated that 36% of the incidents were in a confined space. *Mining (MSHA Report 1988): 38 confined space incidents from 1980 to 1986 with 44 fatalities. According to data collected by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries program, fatal injuries in confined spaces fluctuated from a low of 81 in 1998 to a high of 100 in 2000 during the five-year period, averaging 92 fatalities per year. Rescue Where a system of entry permits is in place, a rescue plan is required, which includes a trained and equipped rescue team available within a reasonable response. It will list the personnel and equipment required to be at the worksite before entry is allowed.

Directed by Sam Wood from a screenplay by Norman Krasna, the film was the product of an independent collaboration between Krasna and producer Frank Ross (Jean Arthur's husband). Their short-lived production company released two films through RKO Radio Pictures (Miss Jones and the later A Lady Takes a Chance released in 1943). The film was well received by critics upon its release and garnered Oscar nominations for Coburn and Krasna. Plot Cantankerous tycoon John P. Merrick (Charles Coburn) goes undercover as a shoe clerk at \\"Neely's\\", one of his New York department stores, to identify agitators trying to form a union, after seeing a newspaper picture of his employees hanging him in effigy. In the store he takes on a new persona, Thomas Higgins. After almost failing the minimum intelligence test he is sent to join the shoe department. There he befriends fellow clerk Mary Jones (Jean Arthur) and her recently fired boyfriend Joe O'Brien (Robert Cummings), a labor union organizer. As the film progresses, his experiences cause him to grow more sympathetic to the needs of his workers. He also starts to fall in love with the sweet-natured clerk Elizabeth Ellis (Spring Byington). During a beach day with his coworkers John begins to see a different side of Joe after he helps him avoid an arrest at a local police station by reciting the Bill of Rights and the Declaration of Independence. Afterwards John joins Joe, Elizabeth, and Mary on the beach, where he and Elizabeth nap until dark. Believing the two to be fully asleep, Joe and Mary discuss the union attempts and the future of their relationship. Unbeknownst to them, John listens in and after Joe leaves he pretends to awake, taking the opportunity to grab a list Joe dropped of employees willing to strike. The remaining trio then travel home via subway, where John drops a card showing that his undercover persona was \\"working\\" for Merrick. This, along with other factors, comes to the conclusion with Joe that he is a spy. Desperate to regain the list, Joe and Mary try unsuccessfully to regain the list and they, along with John, end up in the store manager's office. Disgusted with the treatment of the employees, John berates the store manager, who is unaware of John's true identity. Emboldened by John, Mary declares that they have a list of 400 employees who will strike. The manager tricks the group into giving him the list. When they realize the manager's deceit, John and Mary take back the list and destroy it by eating it, after which Mary uses the intercom system to successfully encourage the entire store to strike. In the following days all of the employees picket Merrick's home. John decides to finally reveal his identity and has Mary, Elizabeth, and Joe meet him and his staff to discuss terms. They are initially unaware of his identity but upon discovery the trio are shocked: Joe faints, Mary screams, and Elizabeth stares up at John in disbelief as John asks her if she would be willing to go back on a statement she made about not wanting to marry a rich man. The film then cuts to a wedding party on a cruise liner, showing that there has been a joint wedding: John has married Elizabeth and Mary has married Joe. The party is made up of all of the store employees and it's shown that John has paid for all of them to take a Hawaiian vacation. They sing \\"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\\".

Anthony (December 18, 1880--August 6, 1961) was an American businessman and philanthropist based in Los Angeles, California who worked in broadcasting and automobiles. He was also a songwriter, journalist and playwright. Early life Earle C. Anthony was born on December 18, 1880. Career Anthony built an electric automobile of his own design, the first to run in Los Angeles, at the age of 17. A replica of this car, made in the 1920s with parts of the original automobile, is exhibited in the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles. In 1923, Anthony was the founder and owner of what eventually became 50,000-watt KFI AM (640) radio, a station he controlled until his death in 1961. From 1929 to 1944, he also owned KECA/1430, which evolved into KABC. He was an early president of the National Association of Broadcasters and during his term oversaw the establishment of the organization's first paid staff. He also was a founder of one of the earliest television stations in Los Angeles, KFI-TV, channel 9 and KFI- FM/105.9 (now defunct),KFI-FM history, retrieved April 19, 2017. both of which were disposed of in 1951. From 1915 to 1958, Anthony was the Packard distributor for all of California, selling one out of every seven Packards. After Packard ceased production in 1958, Anthony acquired two franchises for the ill-fated Edsel, a new, medium-priced car from Ford Motor Company, one in San Francisco and one in Los Angeles. He was also instrumental in developing the concept of the gasoline service station (the Chevron was the trademark of the National Supply Co., a service station chain Anthony headed with several other auto dealers and sold to the Standard Oil Company of California in 1913.) He was also a pioneer in inter-urban bus transportation, founding a company later incorporated into Pacific Greyhound lines and had a role in the development of car radios. Philanthropy Anthony was active in many civic activities. He helped save the Hollywood Bowl by assuming leadership of the Symphony Under Stars Foundation in the early 1930s. He donated resources for a wind-resistant cross to replace others that had previously been blown over in the Coachella Valley (Palm Springs). Anthony helped to bring major league baseball to Los Angeles. This resulted in the Los Angeles Dodger games being carried on KFI and Dodger owner Walter O'Malley becoming a board member of Earle C. Anthony, Inc., according to his biographer, Arthur Landing. Anthony also founded the Los Angeles Auto Show, introduced neon signs to Southern California from France, and personally built the first automobile ever constructed in Los Angeles (later rebuilt and now in the possession of the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles). Personal life, death and legacy Anthony was a lifelong Episcopalian. Anthony died on August 6, 1961. Anthony's only son, Kelly Anthony, was disabled in a WWII mishap and died months after his father. Anthony's fortune went to a trust primarily benefiting the California Institute of Technology and the University of California (the latter of which was Anthony's alma mater). Some of Anthony's employees and friends also received pensions from the trust for the rest of their lives. His home in the Los Feliz area of Los Angeles was designed by Bernard Maybeck. Over the property's history, many internationally distinguished visitors were entertained in the mansion and its eight and one half acre environs. The core building was designed by Maybeck in the style of a medieval renaissance castle. The basic Norman-French and Spanish structure also exhibits Greco-Roman and Moorish influences. After the death of Anthony's wife the home was purchased in the early fifties by Sir Daniel J. and Countess Bernardine Murphy Donohue. The mansion was donated to the Immaculate Heart Sisters in 1971 upon the death of the Countess. The interior of the Nordic entrance tower was furnished by Donohue as a replica of the Pope's prayer room at the Vatican in Rome. As noted, Donohue bequeathed the property to the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. It is currently now known as the Cardinal Timothy Manning House of Prayer for Priests and the Immaculate Heart Retreat House. It is an urban sanctuary available to individuals or groups for a few hours or a day for reflection and prayer. A chapel, dining room and conference rooms are available.

These infections include otitis media, strep throat, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, gonorrhea, and Lyme disease. For gonorrhea typically only one dose is required. In the United States it is a second-line treatment to ceftriaxone for gonorrhea. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include diarrhea, abdominal pain, and nausea. Serious side effects may include allergic reactions and Clostridium difficile diarrhea. It is not recommended in people with a history of a severe penicillin allergy. It appears to be relatively safe during pregnancy. It is in the third-generation cephalosporin class of medications. It works by disrupting the bacteria's cell wall resulting in its death. Cefixime was patented in 1979 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1989. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication in the United States. Medical uses Cefixime treats infections of the: * Urinary tract: Uncomplicated urinary tract infections caused by susceptible isolates of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. * Ear: Otitis media caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pyogenes. * Throat: Tonsillitis and pharyngitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. * Chest and lungs: Chronic bronchitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. * Cervix and urethra: Gonorrhea (cervical/urethral) caused by susceptible isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (penicillinase-and non-penicillinase-producing isolates). It is also used to treat typhoid fever. =Spectrum of bacterial susceptibility= Cefixime is a broad spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic and is commonly used to treat bacterial infections of the ear, urinary tract, and upper respiratory tract. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant microorganisms:http://www.toku-e.com/Assets/MIC/Cefixime%20trihydrate.pdf * Escherichia coli: 0.015 ¬µg/mL ‚Äì 4 ¬µg/mL * Haemophilus influenzae: ‚â§0.004 ¬µg/mL ‚Äì >4 ¬µg/mL * Proteus mirabilis: ‚â§0.008 ¬µg/mL ‚Äì 0.06 ¬µg/mL Mechanism of action The bactericidal action of Cefixime is due to the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. It binds to one of the penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) which inhibits the final transpeptidation step of the peptidoglycan synthesis in the bacterial cell wall, thus inhibiting biosynthesis and arresting cell wall assembly resulting in bacterial cell death. Absorption Only 40‚Äì50% is absorbed from the GI tract (oral bioavailability). Absorption may be decreased when taken with food. Average peak concentration after administration of oral suspension is approximately 25‚Äì50% greater than the peak concentration following oral tablet or capsules administration. Distribution It has high concentrations in bile and urine. It can cross the placenta and its protein binding capacity is 65%. It is always better to perform appropriate cultures and susceptibility studies to determine the causative organism and its sensitivity to cefixime. Contraindications Cefixime is contraindicated in patients with known sensitivity or allergies to cephalosporin class of antibiotics. As Cefixime is a third generation cephalosporin, it is not contraindicated for patients with a true penicillin allergy. Adverse effects Adverse drug reactions include diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea and vomiting. Hypersensitivity reactions like skin rashes, urticaria and Stevens‚ÄìJohnson syndrome have been reported. Though thrombocytopenia has been reported for many cephalosporins, it has not been reported for cefixime. There is no specific antidote for Cefixime overdosage. Gastric lavage may be performed. Dialysis will not remove Cefixime in significant quantities. Drug interactions * Alcohol ‚Äì No major interaction has been observed between cefixime and alcohol. History It was sold under the trade name Suprax 125 in the United States until 2003, when it was taken off the market by drug manufacturer Wyeth after its patent expired. Lupin started selling Suprax in the United States in 2007, and it is available in different formulations and strengths. Marketing Cefixime is marketed under many trade names worldwide; examples include Caricef, Taxim o, Texit, Cef-3, Denvar, 3-C, Cefim, Magnett, Oroken, Ofiken, Fix-A, and Zifi. In India it is marketed as Zifi 200 and is commonly counterfeited.

It contained one referendum question. Question Do you approve of the proposed law for the alteration of the Constitution entitled 'Constitution Alteration (Post-War Reconstruction and Democratic Rights) 1944'? * (16) Post-War Reconstruction and Democratic Rights (not carried) Proposed Amendment Constitution Alteration (Post-War Reconstruction and Democratic Rights) 1944 was known as the \\"14 powers\\", or the \\"14 points referendum\\". It sought to give the federal government power over a period of five years to legislate on a wide variety of matters. The 14 Powers The powers the government sought to gain included: * The rehabilitation of former servicemen * National health * Family allowances * Employment and unemployment * The ability to legislate for indigenous Australians * Corporations, or combines * Foreign investment * Trust laws * Monopolies * Air transport, * Uniformity of railway gauges * Marketing of commodities * Manufacturing (production) and sales of goods * National infrastructure (subject to state approval) Many of these powers also included limitations as safeguards against the abuse of legislative power. Restrictions on Government power * Freedom of speech Freedom of speech and Freedom of Expression were restrictions on state and government power which the commonwealth sought to legislate on. * Freedom of religion The government also sought to apply the right to freedom of religion over state governments. Referendum All of these points (the proposed heads of power and restrictions on power) were put to referendum in the form of a single question. It is notable that the points referring to corporations, trusts, combines, and monopolies had been previously put to referendum, and had not been carried. The 14 proposals covered the participation of the federal government in postwar reconstruction, including control over employment, profiteering and prices, and related subjects. For and Against The proposal was put forward and supported by the Australian Labor Party government. It was opposed by the federal opposition (United Australia Party and the Country Party). =For= The Prime Minister John Curtin gave his broadcast to the nation on 25 July 1944. The Prime Minister said to abandon wartime controls on the declaration of peace would cause disorganization to the social system and destroy the capacity of the system to meet the need of the first few disturbed years after the war. =Against= The Country Party leader, Arthur Fadden, gave his broadcast against the motion stating : It's proposal means that in peacetime, you will work under government compulsion, you will eat and wear what the bureaucrats ration out to you: you will live in mass-produced government dwellings: and your children will work wherever the bureaucrats tell them to work! If granted nothing can be made, produced, built or grown without permission. Everything that is grown or made, carried or carted, sold or exchanged will be under government control. A yes vote would enable the Government to implement Labour's policy of socialization. Nationalization of Industry would follow.

In addition, Cambodian Americans are also Americans with ancestry of other ethnic groups of Cambodia, such as the Cham and Khmer Loeu peoples. According to the 2010 US Census, an estimated 276,667 people of Cambodian descent reside in the United States, with most of the population concentrated in California, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts.Carl L. Bankston, III. \\"Cambodian Americans.\\" Gale Encyclopedia of Multicultural America, edited by Thomas Riggs, (3rd ed., vol. 1, Gale, 2014), pp. 381-393. Online After the fall of Phnom Penh to the Khmer Rouge regime in 1975, few Cambodians were able to escape but it was not until after the regime was overthrown in 1979 did large waves of Cambodians begin immigrating to the US as refugees. Between 1975 and 1994, nearly 158,000 Cambodians were admitted. About 149,000 of them entered the country as refugees, and 6,000 entered as immigrants and 2,500 as humanitarian and public interest parolees. To encourage rapid cultural assimilation and to spread the economic impact, the US government dispersed the refugees into various cities and states throughout the country. However, once established enough to be able to communicate and travel, many Cambodians began migrating to certain places that the climate was more like home, they knew friends and relatives had been sent, or there were rumored to be familiar jobs or higher government benefits. Consequently, large communities of Cambodians took root in cities such as Long Beach, Fresno and Stockton in California; Providence, Rhode Island; Philadelphia; Cleveland, Ohio; as well as Lynn and Lowell in Massachusetts; and Seattle and Portland in the Pacific Northwest. Since 1994, Cambodians admitted into the United States have entered the country as immigrants and not as refugees, but the number per year is small. Most of the increase in the ethnic Cambodian population can be attributed to American-born children of Cambodian immigrants or of newer people of Cambodian descent. Although the Cambodians were spared from the destruction of their home country, whose tragedies maintained a lasting impact into the 21st century, they would come to face newer adversities and hardships in America. The 2010 census counted 276,667 persons of Cambodian descent in the United States, up from 206,052 in 2000. Of them, 231,616 (84%) are all- Cambodian and 45,051 part-Cambodian. Demographics The states with the highest concentration of Cambodian American residents are Rhode Island (0.5%; 5,176), Massachusetts (0.4%; 25,387), Washington (0.3%; 19,101), California (0.2%; 86,244), and Minnesota (0.2%; 7,850). =West Coast= In Southern California, there is a large Cambodian population in Long Beach, and smaller yet significant communities of Cambodians are present in Los Angeles and San Diego metropolitan areas. Four percent of Long Beach's population is of Cambodian descent, mainly concentrated on the city's east section, where there is a Cambodia Town neighborhood. Long Beach, California, has the highest population of people of Cambodian ancestry outside of Cambodia itself. The Pueblo Del Rio housing projects in South Los Angeles were home to around 200 Cambodian families in the 1980s, and as of 2010, remains a smaller but sizable Cambodian American community. The Los Angeles Chinatown has more than 600 Cambodian residents. Santa Ana, California, is 0.5% Cambodian American. The City Heights neighborhood in eastern San Diego has a large concentration of Cambodians. In Northern California, Stockton, Modesto, and Oakland have significant Cambodian populations, while San Jose, Santa Rosa and Sacramento have sizable communities as well. Outside of California, the Pacific Northwest is home to another large Cambodian settlement, specifically in cities such as Tacoma, where Cambodians enumerate at thousands, or 1.6% of the population.Meas, Hay S. Not Just Victims: Conversations with Cambodian Community Leaders in the United States, 2003 There are also growing Cambodian American communities in Las Vegas, Nevada; Phoenix, Arizona; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Denver, Colorado, as the Asian American population continues to rapidly increase in Nevada, Arizona, Utah, and Colorado. =East Coast= Glory Buddhist Temple, one of many examples of Cambodian-American culture in Lowell, Massachusetts Lowell, Massachusetts, has the second highest population of Cambodian Americans in the U.S., and is a center of Cambodian population on the east coast. 13% of its population is of Cambodian descent. Cambodian immigrants settled in Lowell during the mid-1980s, where they opened dozens of small businesses.Plokhii, Olesia; Mashberg, Tom. Cambodian-Americans confronting deportation, The Boston Globe, January 27, 2013. Lynn, Massachusetts, which is nearby Lowell, has the third largest Cambodian American population. Within New England, Providence, Rhode Island, and Portland, Maine (647 residents; 1%), also contain sizable Cambodian American populations. Outside of New England, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area have many residents of Cambodian descent. 480 people of Cambodian descent reside in Utica, New York. =South= In the South, there is a sizable community of Cambodian Americans in Jacksonville, Florida. 1,700 people of Cambodian descent live in Jacksonville. In Spartanburg County, South Carolina, there are 1,123 Cambodian Americans (0.4% of the county). There are very sizable Cambodian American communities in Charlotte, North Carolina, and the Atlanta metropolitan area. There is a Cambodian community in the New Orleans metropolitan area, especially in the town of Buras, Louisiana, which is 9% Cambodian. Many Cambodian immigrants in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, are employed as shrimpers and fishermen.Sasser, Bill. Vietnamese, Cambodian fishermen among hardest hit by BP oil spill, The Christian Science Monitor, May 8, 2010. There are some Cambodian Americans in Marietta, Georgia, Stone Mountain, Georgia and in Riverdale, Georgia. In Riverdale, Georgia they have a Cambodia Town. There is a nonprofit organization in Georgia called the Cambodian American Association of Georgia. =Midwest= The Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul, Minnesota, metropolitan area has been a home to many Southeast Asian refugees, mainly Hmong, but also have thousands of Cambodian American residents. Denver, Colorado, has a growing population of Cambodian Americans with a population of 2,399 and growing as of 2016. Rochester, Minnesota, is 1.2% Cambodian American. As of 2010, there were 1,600 Cambodian Americans living in Columbus, Ohio (0.2%), many of whom live in the Hilltop neighborhood. In Chicago, Illinois, there is a Cambodian community in the Albany Park neighborhood. Academic study of the community Aside from personal memoirs of coming to America, such as those by Loung Ung, a few books have been dedicated to studying the Cambodian American population, such as Khmer American: Identity and Moral Education in a Diasporic Community by Nancy J. Smith-Hefner. The book is an anthropological study of Khmer refugee families, largely from the perspective of the parental generation, residing in metropolitan Boston and eastern Massachusetts. This book was one of the early books among the few circulating that talks about this diasporic community. It exhibits some understanding of both traditional Khmer culture and contemporary American society, but it is not a historical study of Khmer Americans. A more recent book is Buddha Is Hiding, written by Aiwha Ong, an ethnographic study that tells the story of Cambodian Americans and their experiences of American citizenship. The study primarily investigated Khmer refugees in Oakland and the San Francisco Bay Area. The experiences portrayed in the book exemplify what most Cambodian refugees face when dealing with American institutions such as health care systems, welfare, law, police force, church, and school. The book reveals, through extensive ethnographic dialogues, how Cambodian refugees interpret and negotiate American culture, often at the expense of their own Theravada Buddhist cultural upbringing. Survivors: Cambodian Refugees in the United States, written by Sucheng Chan, is a multidisciplinary study of Cambodian Americans drawing on interviews with community leaders, government officials, and staff members in community agencies as well as average Cambodian Americans to capture perspectives from a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds. Not Just Victims: Conversations with Cambodian Community Leaders in the United States, by Sucheng Chan, is a collection of oral history interviews. The interviews, mostly collected in the 1990s, describe the challenges faced by the Cambodian community, and the various organizational efforts to assist with refugee resettlement, cultural assimilation, and social services. It also provides a brief history of the Cambodian genocide and diaspora, and a chapter about the Khmer Krom in the United States. Issues =Lack of education= According to the 2000 census, Cambodian American populations had a lower level of education compared to other populations in the United States, with 53.4% of Cambodian Americans over the age of 25 not possessing a high school diploma, compared to 19.6% of all Americans. =Poverty= In 2000, Cambodian American families reported a median household income of $36,152. A 2008 NYU study reported that 29.3% of the Cambodian American community lived under the poverty line. That was higher than the American average of people living below the poverty line, which, in 2011, was recorded as 16% of all Americans. In 2014, it was reported that Cambodia Town, Long Beach, California, the only officially recognized ethnic enclave of Cambodian Americans, had a poverty rate of 32.4%. That was a little over twice the average of America society as a whole, which was 16% according to a 2011 study by the government. In 2014, a factfinder census, with Americans' per capita income being divided by ethnic groups, Cambodian Americans were revealed to have a per capita income of only $20,182, below the American average of $25,825. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, which was signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1996, resulted in many legal immigrants losing the federal aid that they had been receiving from the Social Security Administration. That especially affected Cambodian immigrants and other Southeast Asians, who were the largest per capita race or ethnic group receiving public assistance in the United States. Under the Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1975, many Southeast Asian refugees were placed on federal welfare rolls. That was intended as a temporary measure until they integrated, but by 1996, they had been stripped of their refugee status. However, nearly 80 percent of California's Southeast Asian population was living in poverty and/or welfare- dependent. That made the law have a large impact on Cambodian Americans and other citizens of Southeast Asian descent. That is a contributing factor to the high poverty rates of Cambodian Americans since the first major wave of Cambodian refugees emigrated to the United States in 1975. =Assimilation= Cambodians faced many difficulties upon settling in the United States, such as having few transferable job skills, lack of English, and having experienced trauma as refugees and genocide survivors. The factors greatly impacted overall household income after resettlement. Many refugees arrived without formal education since the educated and professional classes were targeted during the genocide. That contributed to the difficulty in learning to speak English and in assimilating to the American educational system. Another common phenomenon experienced by some Cambodian American refugees is a lack of familiarity with the history of their homeland. That is prevalent among refugees who were young children when they emigrated to the US and are now adults. Because of their age, they are not able to remember or understand the history of Cambodia that led to their family's migration. Cambodian history is only rarely taught in American public schools which contributes to that unfamiliarity, which is worsened by the resistance of older refugees to discuss the horrors that they witnessed in Cambodia. Their racial and ethnic identity has also provoked social barriers between them and other immigrant groups and American ethnic groups. =Poor mental health= It was estimated in 1990, five years after most arrived to the US, nearly 81% of Cambodians in America met the criteria for major affective disorder, which encompasses depression and generalized anxiety, accounting for the largest subgroup of Southeast Asians afflicted by mental health problems at the time. = Physical health = One study conducted among Cambodian Americans residing in Long Beach, California, found that 13.0% of the adult respondents were current cigarette smokers. When the study was broken down by gender, 24.4% of smokers included in the study were male, and 5.4% were women. The prevalence of smoking was found to be higher in Cambodian American males than in other males residing in California. Additionally, smoking rates are estimated to be higher among Cambodian Americans than among other Asian American groups, with the prevalence of cigarette smoking among the aggregate Asian population in the US around 9.6%, with men and women combined. =Deportation=  Culture  =Cambodia Towns= Cambodian culture is preserved in the various Cambodia Towns throughout the United States, in Cambodian owned restaurants, businesses, and pharmacies.Tran, M. (2009). Trying to get Cambodia Town off the ground. Los Angeles Times. Retrieved February 10, 2018.

Review of Research in Education, 38(1), 137-165. Smot, a traditional form of Buddhist chanting, has been taught at The Khmer Arts Academy. =Museums= Two museums in the US are devoted to the story of Cambodians in America: the Cambodian Cultural Museum and Killing Fields Memorial in Seattle and the Cambodian American Heritage Museum and Killing Fields Memorial in Chicago, both founded in 2004. The Seattle museum was founded by Dara Duong, a survivor of the Cambodian genocide. Politics As of 2012, 62% of registered Cambodian Americans voted in the presidential election, of which 75% voted for Barack Obama.

It is abundant on low-energy rocky reefs at midtide levels, where it outcompetes other algal species due to its high tolerance to desiccation. This is because it has a slimy layer that conserves moisture. The thallus of this species is made up of strings of olive-brown, spherical, gas-filled pneumatocysts, which taper towards a small holdfast that is easily dislodged from the substrate. The spheres rise to the surface of the water during high tide, obtaining more sunlight and moving with the flow of the current.  Reproduction  Male Hormosira conceptacle Female Hormosira conceptacle This seaweed can reproduce asexually from broken fragments. The attached form also reproduces sexually, and is monoecious. The sex organs (conceptacles) are on the surface of the beads, and are visible to the naked eye as rough-looking dimples. Hormosira produces eggs throughout the year, but its peak reproduction is often confined to July‚ÄìOctober (at least in northern New Zealand) when the sea temperature is around 14 ¬∞C, as the viability of the eggs can be low in high sea temperatures such as 17‚Äì22 ¬∞C. At high tide, the eggs are released directly into the surrounding water, and when fertilised, they sink to the substrate to develop for several days before becoming attached. All individuals release at the same time, maximising fertilisation.  Ecology High densities of Hormosira on a broad rocky platform in Kaikoura, New Zealand This seaweed is mostly found in the littoral zone or in rock pools, where it receives plenty of light and enough seawater to avoid desiccation. Hormosira often lives in large patches, minimising moisture loss when the tide is low. Hormosira provides habitat for this obligate epiphyte, Notheia anomala. Hormosira is a food source for sea urchins, many small crustaceans, and some juvenile fish. Young crustaceans and molluscs often rely on the dense canopies of this species for niche space, protection from predators, and retention of moisture under low-tide conditions. It also provides a substrate for sessile organisms to attach to, including sea urchins and a wide range of facultative and obligate algal epiphytes, as the intertidal environment is a greatly competitive habitat with space being one of the primary limiting factors. Adaptations Abiotic To prevent dehydration it stores water in Tough modified leaves with small bladders (pockets). To prevent being washed away it has a strong attachment to rocks, these are structural. It has a slime coat that stops it from drying out when exposed to air, this is Physiological. It grows in groups so as to get less surface area exposed to the sun and area growing in groups also helps it trap water in between branches, this is behavioral. Biotic Its bladder can hold air allowing it to float over other competitors for light, this is structural.

Activated protein C (APC) performs these operations primarily by proteolytically inactivating proteins Factor Va and Factor VIIIa. APC is classified as a serine protease since it contains a residue of serine in its active site. In humans, protein C is encoded by the PROC gene, which is found on chromosome 2. The zymogenic form of protein C is a vitamin K-dependent glycoprotein that circulates in blood plasma. Its structure is that of a two-chain polypeptide consisting of a light chain and a heavy chain connected by a disulfide bond. The protein C zymogen is activated when it binds to thrombin, another protein heavily involved in coagulation, and protein C's activation is greatly promoted by the presence of thrombomodulin and endothelial protein C receptors (EPCRs). Because of EPCR's role, activated protein C is found primarily near endothelial cells (i.e., those that make up the walls of blood vessels), and it is these cells and leukocytes (white blood cells) that APC affects. Because of the crucial role that protein C plays as an anticoagulant, those with deficiencies in protein C, or some kind of resistance to APC, suffer from a significantly increased risk of forming dangerous blood clots (thrombosis). Research into the clinical use of a recombinant form of human Activated Protein C (rhAPC) known as Drotrecogin alfa-activated, branded Xigris by Eli Lilly and Company, has been surrounded by controversy. Eli Lilly ran an aggressive marketing campaign to promote its use for people with severe sepsis and septic shock and sponsored the 2004 Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines. However, a 2012 Cochrane review found that its use cannot be recommended since it does not improve survival and increases bleeding risk. In October 2011, Xigris was withdrawn from the market by Eli Lilly due to a higher mortality in a trial among adults. History Protein C's anticoagulant role in the human body was first noted by Seegers et al. in 1960, who gave protein C its original name, autoprothrombin II-a. Protein C was first isolated by Johan Stenflo from bovine plasma in 1976, and Stenflo determined it to be a vitamin K-dependent protein. He named it protein C because it was the third protein (\\"peak C\\") that eluted from a DEAE-Sepharose ion-exchange chromotograph. Seegers was, at the time, searching for vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors undetected by clotting assays, which measure global clotting function. Soon after this, Seegers recognised Stenflo's discovery was identical with his own. Activated protein C was discovered later that year, and in 1977 it was first recognised that APC inactivates Factor Va. In 1980, Vehar and Davie discovered that APC also inactivates Factor VIIIa, and soon after, Protein S was recognised as a cofactor by Walker. In 1982, a family study by Griffin et al. first associated protein C deficiency with symptoms of venous thrombosis. Homozygous protein C deficiency and the consequent serious health effects were described in 1984 by several scientists. cDNA cloning of protein C was first performed in 1984 by Beckmann et al. which produced a map of the gene responsible for producing protein C in the liver. In 1987 a seminal experiment was performed (Taylor et al.) whereby it was demonstrated that activated protein C prevented coagulopathy and death in baboons infused with lethal concentrations of E. coli. In 1993, a heritable resistance to APC was detected by Dahlb√§ck et al. and associated with familial thrombophilia. In 1994, the relatively common genetic mutation that produces Factor VLeiden was noted (Bertina et al.). Two years later, Gla-domainless APC was imaged at a resolution of 2.8 √Öngstr√∂ms. Beginning with the PROWESS clinical trial of 2001, it was recognised that many of the symptoms of sepsis may be ameliorated by infusion of APC, and mortality rates of septic patients may be significantly decreased. Near the end of that year, Drotrecogin alfa (activated), a recombinant human activated protein C, became the first drug approved by the U.S. FDA for treating severe sepsis. In 2002, Science published an article that first showed protein C activates protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) and this process accounts for the protein's modulation of the immune system. Genetics The biologic instructions for synthesising protein C in humans are encoded in the gene officially named \\"protein C (inactivator of coagulation factors Va and VIIIa)\\". The gene's symbol approved by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee is \\"PROC\\" from \\"protein C\\". It is located on the second chromosome (2q13-q14) and comprises nine exons. The nucleotide sequence that codes for human protein C is approximately 11,000 bases long. Structure Human protein C is a vitamin K-dependent glycoprotein structurally similar to other vitamin K-dependent proteins affecting blood clotting, such as prothrombin, Factor VII, Factor IX and Factor X. Protein C synthesis occurs in the liver and begins with a single- chain precursor molecule: a 32 amino acid N-terminus signal peptide preceding a propeptide. Protein C is formed when a dipeptide of Lys198 and Arg199 is removed; this causes the transformation into a heterodimer with N-linked carbohydrates on each chain. The protein has one light chain (21 kDa) and one heavy chain (41 kDa) connected by a disulfide bond between Cys183 and Cys319. Domain structure of preproprotein C (top) and the mature heterodimer (bottom). Inactive protein C comprises 419 amino acids in multiple domains: one Gla domain (residues 43‚Äì88); a helical aromatic segment (89‚Äì96); two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains (97‚Äì132 and 136‚Äì176); an activation peptide (200‚Äì211); and a trypsin-like serine protease domain (212‚Äì450). The light chain contains the Gla- and EGF-like domains and the aromatic segment. The heavy chain contains the protease domain and the activation petide. It is in this form that 85‚Äì90% of protein C circulates in the plasma as a zymogen, waiting to be activated. The remaining protein C zymogen comprises slightly modified forms of the protein. Activation of the enzyme occurs when a thrombin molecule cleaves away the activation peptide from the N-terminus of the heavy chain. The active site contains a catalytic triad typical of serine proteases (His253, Asp299 and Ser402). The Gla domain is particularly useful for binding to negatively charged phospholipids for anticoagulation and to EPCR for cytoprotection. One particular exosite augments protein C's ability to inactivate Factor Va efficiently. Another is necessary for interacting with thrombomodulin. Physiology The activation of protein C is strongly promoted by thrombomodulin and endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), the latter of which is found primarily on endothelial cells (cells on the inside of blood vessels). The presence of thrombomodulin accelerates activation by several orders of magnitude, and EPCR speeds up activation by a factor of 20. If either of these two proteins is absent in murine specimens, the mouse dies from excessive blood-clotting while still in an embryonic state. On the endothelium, APC performs a major role in regulating blood clotting, inflammation, and cell death (apoptosis). Because of the accelerating effect of thrombomodulin on the activation of protein C, the protein may be said to be activated not by thrombin but the thrombin‚Äìthrombomodulin (or even thrombin‚Äìthrombomodulin‚ÄìEPCR) complex. Once in active form, APC may or may not remain bound to EPCR, to which it has approximately the same affinity as the protein zymogen. Protein C in zymogen form is present in normal adult human blood plasma at concentrations between 65‚Äì135 IU/dL. Activated protein C is found at levels approximately 2000 times lower than this. Mild protein C deficiency corresponds to plasma levels above 20 IU/dL, but below the normal range. Moderately severe deficiencies describe blood concentrations between 1 and 20 IU/dL; severe deficiencies yield levels of protein C that are below 1 IU/dL or are undetectable. Protein C levels in a healthy term infant average 40 IU/dL. The concentration of protein C increases until six months, when the mean level is 60 IU/dL; the level stays low through childhood until it reaches adult levels after adolescence. The half-life of activated protein C is around 15 minutes. Pathways The protein C pathways are the specific chemical reactions that control the level of expression of APC and its activity in the body. Protein C is pleiotropic, with two main classes of functions: anticoagulation and cytoprotection (its direct effect on cells). Which function protein C performs depends on whether or not APC remains bound to EPCR after it is activated; the anticoagulative effects of APC occur when it does not. In this case, protein C functions as an anticoagulant by irreversibly proteolytically inactivating Factor Va and Factor VIIIa, turning them into Factor Vi and Factor VIIIi respectively. When still bound to EPCR, activated protein C performs its cytoprotective effects, acting on the effector substrate PAR-1, protease-activated receptor-1. To a degree, APC's anticoagulant properties are independent of its cytoprotective ones, in that expression of one pathway is not affected by the existence of the other. The activity of protein C may be down-regulated by reducing the amount either of available thrombomodulin or of EPCR. This may be done by inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1Œ≤ (IL-1Œ≤ ) and tumor necrosis factor-Œ± (TNF-Œ±). Activated leukocytes release these inflammatory mediators during inflammation, inhibiting the creation of both thrombomodulin and EPCR, and inducing their shedding from the endothelial surface. Both of these actions down-regulate protein C activation. Thrombin itself may also have an effect on the levels of EPCR. In addition, proteins released from cells can impede protein C activation, for example eosinophil, which may explain thrombosis in hypereosinophilic heart disease. Protein C may be up-regulated by platelet factor 4. This cytokine is conjectured to improve activation of protein C by forming an electrostatic bridge from protein C's Gla domain to the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) domain of thrombomodulin, reducing the Michaelis constant (KM) for their reaction. In addition, Protein C is inhibited by protein C inhibitor. =Anticoagulative effects= Blood coagulation and the protein C anticoagulation pathway Protein C is a major component in anticoagulation in the human body. It acts as a serine protease zymogen: APC proteolyses peptide bonds in activated Factor V and Factor VIII (Factor Va and Factor VIIIa), and one of the amino acids in the bond is serine. These proteins that APC inactivates, Factor Va and Factor VIIIa, are highly procoagulant cofactors in the generation of thrombin, which is a crucial element in blood clotting; together they are part of the prothrombinase complex. Cofactors in the inactivation of Factor Va and Factor VIIIa include protein S, Factor V, high-density lipoprotein, anionic phospholipids and glycosphingolipids. Factor Va binds to prothrombin and Factor Xa, increasing the rate at which thrombin is produced by four orders of magnitude (10,000x). Inactivation of Factor Va thus practically halts the production of thrombin. Factor VIII, on the other hand, is a cofactor in production of activated Factor X, which in turn converts prothrombin into thrombin. Factor VIIIa augments Factor X activation by a factor of around 200,000. Because of its importance in clotting, Factor VIII is also known as anti-haemophilic factor, and deficiencies of Factor VIII cause haemophilia A. APC inactivates Factor Va by making three cleavages (Arg306, Arg506, Arg679). The cleavages at both Arg306 and Arg506 diminish the molecule's attraction to Factor Xa, and though the first of these sites is slow to be cleaved, it is entirely necessary to the functioning of Factor V. Protein S aids this process by catalysing the proteolysis at Arg306, in which the A2 domain of Factor V is dissociated from the rest of the protein. Protein S also binds to Factor Xa, inhibiting the latter from diminishing APC's inactivation of Factor Va. The inactivation of Factor VIIIa is not as well understood. The half-life of Factor VIIIa is only around two minutes unless Factor IXa is present to stabilise it. Some have questioned the significance of APC's inactivation of Factor VIIIa, and it is unknown to what degree Factor V and protein S are cofactors in its proteolysis. It is known that APC works on Factor VIIIa by cleaving at two sites, Arg336 and Arg562, either of which is sufficient to disable Factor VIIIa and convert it to Factor VIIIi. =Cytoprotective effects= When APC is bound to EPCR, it performs a number of important cytoprotective (i.e. cell- protecting) functions, most of which are known to require EPCR and PAR-1. These include regulating gene expression, anti-inflammatory effects, antiapoptotic effects and protecting endothelial barrier function. Treatment of cells with APC demonstrates that its gene expression modulation effectively controls major pathways for inflammatory and apoptotic behaviour. There are about 20 genes that are up-regulated by protein C, and 20 genes that are down- regulated: the former are generally anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic pathways, while the latter tend to be proinflammatory and proapoptotic. APC's mechanisms for altering gene expression profiles are not well understood, but it is believed that they at least partly involve an inhibitory effect on transcription factor activity. Important proteins that APC up-regulates include Bcl-2, eNOS and IAP. APC effects significant down-regulation of p53 and Bax. APC has anti-inflammatory effects on endothelial cells and leukocytes. APC affects endothelial cells by inhibiting inflammatory mediator release and down-regulating vascular adhesion molecules. This reduces leukocyte adhesion and infiltration into tissues, while also limiting damage to underlying tissue. APC supports endothelial barrier function and reduces chemotaxis. APC inhibits the release of inflammatory-response mediators in leukocytes as well as endothelial cells, by reducing cytokine response, and maybe diminishing systemic inflammatory response, such as is seen in sepsis. Studies on both rats and humans have demonstrated that APC reduces endotoxin- induced pulmonary injury and inflammation. Scientists recognise activated protein C's antiapoptotic effects, but are unclear as to the exact mechanisms by which apoptosis is inhibited. It is known that APC is neuroprotective. Antiapoptosis is achieved with diminished activation of caspase 3 and caspase 8, improved Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and down-regulation of p53. Activated protein C also provides much protection of endothelial barrier function. Endothelial barrier breakdown, and the corresponding increase in endothelial permeability, are associated with swelling, hypotension and inflammation, all problems of sepsis. APC protects endothelial barrier function by inducing PAR-1 dependent sphingosine kinase-1 activation and up-regulating sphingosine-1-phosphate with sphingosine kinase. Several studies have indicated that the proteolytic activity of APC contributes to the observed cytoprotective properties of APC, but variants that are proteolytically inactive also are able to regulate formation of PAR-activators thrombin and factor Xa and express cytoprotective properties in vitro and in vivo. Role in disease A genetic protein C deficiency, in its mild form associated with simple heterozygosity, causes a significantly increased risk of venous thrombosis in adults. If a fetus is homozygous or compound heterozygous for the deficiency, there may be a presentation of purpura fulminans, severe disseminated intravascular coagulation and simultaneous venous thromboembolism in the womb; this is very severe and usually fatal. Deletion of the protein C gene in mice causes fetal death around the time of birth. Fetal mice with no protein C develop normally at first, but experience severe bleeding, coagulopathy, deposition of fibrin and necrosis of the liver. The frequency of protein C deficiency among asymptomatic individuals is between 1 in 200 and 1 in 500. In contrast, significant symptoms of the deficiency are detectable in 1 in 20,000 individuals. No racial nor ethnic biases have been detected. Activated protein C resistance occurs when APC is unable to perform its functions. This disease has similar symptoms to protein C deficiency. The most common mutation leading to activated protein C resistance among Caucasians is at the cleavage site in Factor V for APC. There, Arg506 is replaced with Gln, producing Factor V Leiden. This mutation is also called a R506Q. The mutation leading to the loss of this cleavage site actually stops APC from effectively inactivating both Factor Va and Factor VIIIa. Thus, the person's blood clots too readily, and he is perpetually at an increased risk for thrombosis. Individuals heterozygous for the Factor VLeiden mutation carry a risk of venous thrombosis 5‚Äì7 times higher than in the general population. Homozygous subjects have a risk 80 times higher. This mutation is also the most common hereditary risk for venous thrombosis among Caucasians. Around 5% of APC resistance are not associated with the above mutation and Factor VLeiden. Other genetic mutations cause APC resistance, but none to the extent that Factor VLeiden does. These mutations include various other versions of Factor V, spontaneous generation of autoantibodies targeting Factor V, and dysfunction of any of APC's cofactors. Also, some acquired conditions may reduce the efficacy of APC in performing its anticoagulative functions. Studies suggest that between 20% and 60% of thrombophilic patients suffer from some form of APC resistance. Warfarin necrosis is an acquired protein C deficiency due to treatment with warfarin, which is a vitamin K antagonist and an anticoagulant itself. However, warfarin treatment may produce paradoxical skin lesions similar to those seen in purpura fulminans. A variant of this response presents as venous limb gangrene when warfarin is used to treat deep vein thrombosis associated with cancer. In these situations, warfarin may be restarted at a low dosage to ensure that the protein C deficiency does not present before the vitamin K coagulation factors II, IX and X are suppressed. Activated protein C cleaves Plasmodium falciparum histones which are released during infection: cleavage of these histones eliminates their pro inflammatory effects. Role in medicine In November 2001, the Food and Drug Administration approved Drotrecogin alfa-activated (DrotAA) for the clinical treatment of adults suffering from severe sepsis and with a high risk of death. Drotrecogin alfa-activated is a recombinant form of human activated protein C (rhAPC). It is marketed as Xigris by Eli Lilly and Company, Drotrecogin alfa-activated was the subject of significant controversy while it was approved for clinical use as it was found to increase bleeding and not to reduce mortality. In October 2011 rhAPC (Xigris¬Æ) was withdrawn from the market by Eli Lilly due to a higher mortality in a trial among adults. APC has been studied as way of treating lung injury, after studies showed that in patients with lung injury, reduced APC levels in specific parts of the lungs correlated with worse outcomes. APC also has been considered for use in improving patient outcome in cases of ischemic stroke, a medical emergency in which arterial blockage deprives a region of brain of oxygen, causing tissue death. Promising studies suggest that APC could be coupled with the only currently approved treatment, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), to protect the brain from tPA's very harmful side effects, in addition to preventing cell death from lack of oxygen (hypoxia). Clinical use of APC has also been proposed for improving the outcome of pancreatic islet transplantation in treating type I diabetes.

Smith began evolving into the era's dominant life-form ‚Äì the Victorian gentleman ‚Äì and also took over the house. By 1883, Smith, having \\"evolved\\" into forms approximating a human and casting off his old husks as an insect would, managed to lure and capture the explorer Redvers Fenn-Cooper, brainwashing him. Utilising Fenn-Cooper's association with Queen Victoria, he plans to get close to her so that he can assassinate her and subsequently take control of the British Empire. The TARDIS arrives at Gabriel Chase. It turns out that Ace had visited the house in 1983 and had felt an evil presence, and the Seventh Doctor's curiosity drives him to seek the answers. The Doctor encounters Control, which has now taken on human form, and makes a deal with it. The Doctor helps it release Light. Once awake, Light is displeased by all the change that has occurred on the planet while he was asleep. While Light tries to make sense of all the change, Smith tries to keep his plan intact, but events are moving beyond his control. As Control tries to \\"evolve\\" into a Lady, and Ace tries to come to grips with her feelings about the house, the Doctor himself tries to keep the upper hand in all the events that have been set in motion. The Doctor finally convinces Light of the futility of opposing evolution, which causes him to overload and dissipate into the surrounding house. Also, Control's complete evolution into a Lady derails Smith's plan as Fenn-Cooper, having freed himself from Smith's brainwashing, chooses to side with her instead of him. In the end, with Smith taken captive on the ship, Control, Fenn-Cooper and Nimrod set off in the alien ship to explore the universe. =Outside references= In the dinner scene, the Doctor asks rhetorically, \\"Who was it said Earthmen never invite their ancestors round to dinner?\\" This refers to Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Production =Pre-production= Working titles for this story included The Bestiary and Life-Cycle. As revealed in the production notes for the DVD release, the story was renamed Das Haus der tausend Schrecken (The House of a Thousand Frights/Horrors) upon translation into German. The story evolved out of an earlier, rejected script entitled Lungbarrow. It was to be set on Gallifrey in the Doctor's ancestral home and deal with the Doctor's past, but producer John Nathan-Turner felt that it revealed too much of the Doctor's origins. It was reworked to make both evolution and the idea of an ancient house central to the story. Marc Platt used elements of his original idea for his Virgin New Adventures novel Lungbarrow. =Production= Ghost Light turned out to be the final production of the series' original 26-year run, with the last recorded sequence being the final scene between Mrs Pritchard and Gwendoline. It was not, however, the last to be screened ‚Äî The Curse of Fenric and Survival, both produced beforehand, followed it in transmission order. =Cast notes= Michael Cochrane and Frank Windsor had both previously appeared in Doctor Who alongside Peter Davison; Cochrane as Charles Cranleigh in Black Orchid in Season 19, while Windsor played Ranulf in The King's Demons in Season 20. Carl Forgione appeared in the final serial of the Jon Pertwee era, Planet of the Spiders. Commercial releases =In print= A novelisation of this serial, written by Marc Platt, was published by Target Books in September 1990. In June 2011, an audiobook of the novelisation was released, read by Ian Hogg. The script of this serial, edited by John McElroy, was published by Titan Books in June 1993. Marc Platt contributed a chapter, written especially for this book, which rectified the omissions from the transmitted story. =Home media= Ghost Light was released on VHS in May 1994. A DVD release followed in September 2004, with many extended and deleted scenes included as bonus features. However, unlike the situation with The Curse of Fenric, these scenes no longer existed in broadcast quality as the master 625 line PAL colour videotapes containing the extra footage had been erased for reuse shortly after the story was broadcast, and were thus sourced from VHS copies, some with timecodes burnt-in, i.e. recorded permanently onto the picture. This made an extended edit, as had been prepared for the Curse of Fenric DVD release the previous year, impossible. This serial was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in Issue 96 on 5 September 2012. Also in February 2020 the full serial was released as part of the Doctor Who: The Collection Season 26 box-set with a new Extended Workprint Cut. Extended Workprint =Soundtrack release= The soundtrack album for this serial was released on Silva Screen Records in 1993 on CD with a cover adapted from the novelisation cover. It was reissued on CD with extra tracks on 26 August 2013 with a new cover. Track listing  Critical analysis  A book length study of the serial, written by Jonathan Dennis, was published as part of The Black Archive series from Obverse Books in 2016. The serial was covered in volume 46 of the Doctor Who: The Complete History book series, which reprinted Andrew Pixley's Archive features from Doctor Who Magazine and the various Doctor Who Magazine Special Editions, as well as new articles created specifically for the book.

It was developed by Richard L. Nolan during the early 1970s, and with the final version of the model published by him in the Harvard Business Review in 1979. Development Both articles describing the stages were first published in the Harvard Business Review. The first proposal was made in 1973 and consisted of only four stages. Two additional stages were added in 1979 to complete his six stage model. Summary Nolan‚Äôs model concerns the general approach to IT in business. The model proposes that evolution of IT in organizations begins slowly in Stage I, the \\"initiation\\" stage. This stage is marked by \\"hands off\\" user awareness and an emphasis on functional applications to reduce costs. Stage I is followed by further growth of IT in the \\"contagion\\" stage. In this stage there is a proliferation of applications as well as the potential for more problems to arise. During Stage III a need for \\"control\\" arises. Centralized controls are put in place and a shift occurs from management of computers to management of data resources. Next, in Stage IV, \\"integration\\" of diverse technological solutions evolves. Management of data allows development without increasing IT expenditures in Stage V. Finally, in Stage VI, \\"maturity\\", high control is exercised by using all the information from the previous stages. =Stage I ‚Äì Initiation= In this stage, information technology is first introduced into the organization. According to Nolan‚Äôs article in 1973, computers were introduced into companies for two reasons. The first reason deals with the company reaching a size where the administrative processes cannot be accomplished without computers. Also, the success of the business justifies large investment in specialized equipment. The second reason deals with computational needs. Nolan defined the critical size of the company as the most prevalent reason for computer acquisition. Due to the unfamiliarity of personnel with the technology, users tend to take a \\"hands off\\" approach to new technology. This introductory software is simple to use and cheap to implement, which provides substantial monetary savings to the company. During this stage, the IT department receives little attention from management and work in a \\"carefree\\" atmosphere. Stage I Key points: * User awareness is characterized as being \\"hands off\\". * IT personnel are \\"specialized for technological learning\\". * IT planning and control is not extensive. * There is an emphasis on functional applications to reduce costs. =Stage II ‚Äì Contagion= Even though the computers are recognised as ‚Äúchange agents‚Äù in Stage I, Nolan acknowledged that many users become alienated by computing. Because of this, Stage II is characterised by a managerial need to explain the potential of computer applications to alienated users. This leads to the adoption of computers in a range of different areas. A problem that arises in Stage II is that project and budgetary controls are not developed. Unavoidably, this leads to a saturation of existing computer capacity and more sophisticated computer systems being obtained. System sophistication requires employing specialised professionals. Due to the shortage of qualified individuals, implementing these employees results in high salaries. The budget for computer organisation rises significantly and causes concern for management. Although the price of Stage II is high, it is evident that planning and control of computer systems is necessary. Stage II Key points: * There is a proliferation of applications. * Users are superficially enthusiastic about using data processing. * Management control is even more relaxed. * There is a rapid growth of budgets. * Treatment of the computer by management is primarily as just a machine. * Rapid growth of computer use occurs throughout the organisations' functional areas. * Computer use is plagued by crisis after crisis. =Stage III ‚Äì Control= Stage III is a reaction against excessive and uncontrolled expenditures of time and money spent on computer systems, and the major problem for management is the organization of tasks for control of computer operating costs. In this stage, project management and management report systems are organized, which leads to development of programming, documentation, and operation standards. During Stage III, a shift occurs from management of computers to management of data resources. This shift is an outcome of analysis of how to increase management control and planning in expending data processing operations. Also, the shift provides flexibility in data processing that is needed in a case of management‚Äôs new controls. The major characteristic of Stage III is reconstruction of data processing operation. Stage III Key points: * There is no reduction in computer use. * IT division's importance to the organization is greater. * Centralized controls are put in place. * Applications are often incompatible or inadequate. * There is use of database and communications, often with negative general management reaction. * End user frustration is often the outcome. =Stage IV ‚Äì Integration= Stage IV features the adoption of new technology to integrate systems that were previously separate entities. This creates data processing (IT) expenditure growth rates similar to that of Stage II. In the latter half of Stage IV, exclusive reliance on computer controls leads to inefficiencies. The inefficiencies associated with rapid growth may create another wave of problems simultaneously. This is the last stage that Nolan acknowledged in his initial proposal of the stages of growth in 1973. Stage IV Key points: * There is rise of control by the users. * A larger data processing budget growth exists. * There is greater demand for on- line database facilities. * Data processing department now operates like a computer utility. * There is formal planning and control within data processing. * Users are more accountable for their applications. * The use of steering committees, applications financial planning becomes important. * Data processing has better management controls and set standards. =Stage V ‚Äì Data administration= Nolan determined that four stages were not enough to describe the proliferation of IT in an organization and added Stage V in 1979. Stage V features a new emphasis on managing corporate data rather than IT. Like the proceeding Stage VI, it is marked by the development and maturity of the new concept of data administration. Stage V Key points: * Data administration is introduced. * There is identification of data similarities, its usage, and its meanings within the whole organization. * The applications portfolio is integrated into the organization. * Data processing department now serves more as an administrator of data resources than of machines. * A key difference is the use of term IT/IS rather than data processing.. =Stage VI ‚Äì Maturity= In Stage VI, the application portfolio ‚Äî tasks like orderly entry, general ledger, and material requirements planning ‚Äî is completed and its structure ‚Äúmirrors‚Äù the organization and information flows in the company. During this stage, tracking sales growth becomes an important aspect. On the average, 10% batch and remote job entry, 60% are dedicated to data base and data communications processing, 5% personal computing, 25% minicomputer processing. Management control systems are used the most in Stage VI (40%). There are three aspects of management control; manufacturing, marketing and financial. Manufacturing control demands forecasting ‚Äî looking down the road for future needs. Marketing control strictly deals with research. Financial control, forecasts cash requirements for the future. Stage VI exercises high control, by compiling all of the information from Stages I through V. This allows the organization to function at high levels of efficiency and effectiveness. Stage VI Key points: * Systems now reflect the real information needs of the organization. * Greater use of data resources to develop competitive and opportunistic applications. * Data processing organisation is viewed solely as a data resource function. * Data processing now emphasizes data resource strategic planning. * Ultimately, users and DP department jointly responsible for the use of data resources within the organization. * Manager of IT system takes on the same importance in the organizational hierarchy as say the director of finance or director of HR Initial reaction Richard Nolan‚Äôs Stages of Growth Model seemed ahead of its time when it was first published in the 1970s. Legacy Critics agree that Nolan‚Äôs model presents several shortcomings and is slightly out of date. As time has progressed, Richard Nolan‚Äôs Stages of Growth Model has revealed some apparent weaknesses. However, many agree that this does not take away from his innovative look into the realm of computing development. Criticism An argument posed dealt with the main focus on the change in budget, and whether it is ‚Äúreasonable to assume that a single variable serves as a suitable surrogate for so much.‚Äù It seems logical that this single variable could be an indicator of other variables such as the organizational environment or an organization's learning curve, but not that it is the sole driving force of the entire model. Nolan shows little connection that would make his initial point a valid one. In his model, Richard Nolan states that the force behind the growth of computing through the stages is technological change. King and Kramer find this to be far too general as they say, ‚Äúthere are additional factors that should be considered. Most important are the \\"demand-side\\" factors that create a ripe environment for technological changes to be considered and adopted.‚Äù As proposed, technological change has a multitude of facets that determine its necessity. Change cannot be brought forth unless it is needed under certain circumstances. Unwarranted change would result in excess costs and potential failure of the process. Last, the stages of growth model assumes straightforward organizational goals that are to be determined through the technological change. This can be viewed as very na√Øve from the user perspective. King and Kraemer state, ‚Äúthe question of whether organizational goals are uniform and consistent guides for the behavior of organizational actors, as opposed to dynamic and changing targets that result from competition and conflict among organizational actors, has received considerable attention in the literature on computing.‚Äù Clearly, organizational goals are ever changing and sometimes rigid indicators of direction. They cannot be ‚Äúuniform‚Äù objectives that are not subject to change.

The story was published on 1 January 1884 in the New Year's Day issue of the Warsaw Courier (Kurier Warszawski).Krystyna Tokarz√≥wna and Stanis≈Çaw Fita, Boles≈Çaw Prus, 1847-1912: Kalendarz ≈ºycia i tw√≥rczo≈õci (Boles≈Çaw Prus, 1847-1912: a Calendar of His Life and Work), p. 320. The story comes from a period of pessimism in the author's life caused by Poland's political situation (in which nine decades earlier, upon the completion of the Partitions of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, Poland had ceased to exist as an independent country) and by the 1883 failure of Nowiny (News), a Warsaw daily that Prus had been editing for less than a year.Christopher Kasparek, \\"Two Micro-Stories by Boles≈Çaw Prus,\\" The Polish Review, 1995, no. 1, p. 99. Theme Temple of the Sibyl at Pu≈Çawy The story is set adjacent to the Temple of the Sibyl on the grounds of the old Czartoryski estate in Pu≈Çawy. The Temple had been erected in the late 18th century by Princess Izabela Czartoryska as a museum and patriotic memorial to the late Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. Next to the Temple is a boulder, overgrown with molds, which at a certain moment magically transforms into a globe. In his one-and-a-half-page micro-story, Prus identifies human societies with colonies of molds that contest the surface of the globe. He thus provides a metaphor for the competitive struggle for existence that goes on among human societies. This theme resonates with Prus' last major‚Äîand only historical‚Äînovel, Pharaoh (1895), and still more with his first major novel, The Outpost (1886). The latter depicts the struggle of the stolid Polish peasant ≈ölimak (\\"Snail\\") to hang onto his farmstead against the encroachments of German settlers who are buying up adjacent land, encouraged by their government's policy of expansion into ethnically Polish lands. Prus' metaphor of society-as-organism, which he uses implicitly in \\"Mold of the Earth\\" and explicitly in the introduction to his novel Pharaoh, was borrowed from the sociological writings of Herbert Spencer, who had invented the expression \\"survival of the fittest\\" and exerted the greatest influence on Prus' thinking.Zygmunt Szweykowski, Tw√≥rczo≈õƒá Boles≈Çawa Prusa, pp. 21-22. Temple of the Sibyl. 19th-century engraving. The story's setting carries a patriotic subtext, since Izabela and Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski had in the 18th century turned their estate into a leading private center of Polish history and culture. They had particularly dedicated the Temple of the Sibyl as a museum and memorial to the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth which had been, in their lifetime, partitioned out of political existence by the neighboring Russian, Prussian and Austrian empires. Inspirations In 1869, 22-year-old Boles≈Çaw Prus had briefly studied at the Agricultural and Forestry Institute that had been established on the old Czartoryski estate. Before that, he had spent several years of his early childhood in Pu≈Çawy. \\"Mold of the Earth\\" is one of several micro-stories by Boles≈Çaw Prus that were partly inspired by 19th-century French prose poetry.Zygmunt Szweykowski, Tw√≥rczo≈õƒá Boles≈Çawa Prusa, p. 99.

Early life and education De Large was born in Aiken, South Carolina on March 15, 1842, the mixed-race son of a Haitian free woman of color and a Sephardi Jewish father, according to scholar Benjamin Ginsberg.Ginsberg, Benjamin.

De Large's parents' names are not known, but his father was a tailor and his mother a seamstress. His parents encouraged his education, sending him to North Carolina for primary school; he returned to Charleston and graduated from Wood High School. De Large became a tailor and farmer. As a young man, De Large became a member of the Brown Fellowship Society of Charleston, made up of people of color who had been free before the war. They were among the elite African Americans in the city who were skilled artisans and led the people of color. During the war, De Large was employed by the Confederate Navy. He saved considerable sums and established a stake for after the war. At that time, he became involved in politics, and was elected as a delegate to the South Carolina constitutional convention in 1868. That year he was also elected as a Republican member of the South Carolina House of Representatives, serving one term until 1870 when he was elected State land commissioner. He was also one of the commissioners of the State's sinking fund. De Large was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives later that year. He served in the US House of Representatives from March 4, 1871 until January 24, 1873. At that time, Congress declared the seat vacant as the result of an election challenge by his Republican opponent Christopher C. Bowen. The Election Committee of the House found there so many 'abuses and irregularities' on both sides during the election that determining a victor was impossible. In addition, it found that De Large had maintained two positions in South Carolina government that were incompatible with his role as a congressman. On January 18, 1873, the committee declared the seat vacant for the rest of the 42nd Congress, set to adjourn in March, and gained agreement by the full House.Chester H.

Frank Morgan received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his poignant portrayal of The Pirate. Plot Danny inherits two houses in the central coastal area of California, so Pilon and his poor, idle friends move in. One of them, the Pirate, is saving money which Pilon endeavors to steal, until he discovers that it is being collected to purchase a golden candlestick which he intends to burn for St. Francis to honor the Pirate's dead dog. One of the houses burns down, so Danny allows his friends to move into the other house with him, and in gratitude Pilon tries to make life better for his friend. Things are fine at first until Danny's passion for a lovely girl causes him to actually go to work in a fishing business. A misunderstanding caused by Pilon about a vacuum cleaner Danny had bought for the girl, enrages Danny; he becomes drunk and a bit crazy. He almost dies in an accident while interrupting the girl at her work in a cannery, but through Pilon's prayers, is restored to health. He then marries his sweetheart with the promise that he will become a fisherman now that Pilon has found the money to buy a boat. The happy ending is quite different from the novel's ending in which Danny dies after a fall.

Although no JGTC or Super GT driver have died during their race events so far, the incident occurred almost a year after Tetsuya Ota's near-fatal, fiery accident at Fuji Speedway. In March 2003, the Tanaka International Company, parent company of the official circuit owner TI Circuit Company, applied for civil rehabilitation. After the application, Unimat Holding Co., Ltd. announced that it would financially support the TI Circuit Company in keeping the facility open. The company was renamed Okayama International Circuit Co., Ltd. on May 1, 2004, and the circuit was renamed Okayama International Circuit on January 1, 2005. On October 26, 2008, the circuit hosted a round of the Formula V6 Asia and FIA World Touring Car Championship. The WTCC race was the first FIA world championship race since 1995. However, it was announced on June 21, 2010 that Suzuka Circuit would host the Japan round of the 2011 WTCC season instead of the Okayama International Circuit. On March 3, 2012, Unimat sold the circuit to Aska Corporation, an auto parts manufacturing company. In 2018, 12-year-old Juju Noda set the lap record for Formula 4 machinery around the Okayama International Circuit, recording a time of 1 minute 32.8 seconds ‚Äì nearly a second faster than the previous best time.

These include the emergency medical services, hospital departments, blood banks, clinical teaching services and others. A medical director devises the protocols and guidelines for the clinical staff and evaluates them while they are in use. Emergency medical services The role of a medical director in the emergency medical services (EMS) varies by which type of system is in use. =Franco-German model= The first model, arguably the oldest, is generally described as the Franco-German model. This model is physician-led, and those personnel who serve emergencies from ambulances are often place in minor, supporting roles. There is ample evidence indicating that at the turn of the 20th century, many North American hospital-based ambulances in larger centres were staffed by ambulance surgeons; physicians who responded in the ambulance and provided care in a manner which very much resembles the current Franco-German model. In the French version of the model, only physicians and nurses perform advanced care, and ambulance drivers have only minimal medical training. In the German version of the model, there are paramedics (called Rettungsassistenten). Medical control is on-line, immediate, and direct. The training of the Rettungsassistent is comparable to that of many North American paramedics, but they may be limited in their scope of practice. Paramedics may practice advanced life support skills at all times when the physician with whom they work is physically present. In some cases they are restricted in action if there is no physician present, a legal position mostly claimed by the physicians' lobby. Under German law, unless an immediately life-threatening or potentially debilitating emergency is present, such individuals may be limited to basic life support skills only, or to restricted ALS skills, which are defined in the \\"standing orders\\" of the medical director of each respective county. In 2003, there was a reform movement to expand the \\"standing competency\\", especially in the realm of pain treatment, by offering additional training to the level of \\"Notfallsanitaeter\\". This model is intended to bring physician-centred definitive care to the patient, rather than bringing the patient to the care. As a result, in addition to conventional ambulances, most communities have physicians (called Notarzt) who respond directly to every life-threatening call to provide care. This system does not recognize emergency medicine as a medical specialty, in the sense that North Americans understand it. In these cases, the 'emergency physician' is most commonly an anesthetist, or sometimes an internist or a surgeon. In most areas of Europe, there appears to be little interest in developing emergency medicine as a specialty, although recent developments in Italy suggest that this attitude may be changing. In this model, long 'at scene' times are common. The physician attempts to provide some or all of the intervention that is necessary in place, with transportation to hospital occurring only for those with a legitimate need of a hospital bed, and urgent transportation to hospital being extremely rare. Many patients will never be transported to hospital. In the French version of this model, even the triage of incoming requests for service is physician-led, with a physician, assisted by others, interviewing the caller and determining what type of response resource, if any, will be sent. The German version of this model uses 'conventional' dispatch processes, with the physician being sent to calls as requested by the EMS dispatcher. The Franco-German model operates in most places in Europe and Russia, but not in the United Kingdom. In this model, the medical director is typically more of a leader of physicians, and an advisor on the training of, and quality control for, subordinate staff. In Germany, the term √Ñrztlicher Leiter Rettungsdienst is used. This physician's role is to oversee EMS personnel in a defined area, typically a bigger city or county, and it corresponds to the position of medical director in North America.German Federal Board of Physicians: Guidelines for the Medical director EMS =Anglo-American= The Anglo-American model of care is largely led by the medical director. This model has evolved significantly since its origins in the late 1960s. The development of this role, the professionalization of emergency medical services, the profession of paramedic, and the medical specialty of emergency medicine, have all developed in a symbiotic relationship since the early years. Prior to 1979, there was no formal specialty training certification for emergency medicine. Prior to 1970, there was no concerted effort to formally train physicians in its practice in the U.S. In the U.K., formal consultancies in Emergency Medicine had existed for at least two decades before that time. In the Anglo-American model of care, the physician remains the leader of the care team, but paramedics function much more independently than in the Franco-German model. This has not always been the case. In the earliest days of paramedicine, paramedics were required to contact a physician for formal orders for each intervention that they performed. Some specialists believed this was the only safe approach to providing care in this fashion. In some early cases, 'paramedics' operated blindly, providing medications from numbered or colour-coded syringes as they were directed by the physician, with no real understanding of the actions they were performing. Control was absolute and immediate; there were examples of paramedics being trained, but not legally permitted to perform their skills, or in other cases, they could take action only with a physician or nurse present, much like the existing Franco-German model. In the earliest stages of paramedicine, the paramedics were not yet formally licenses and often served as an extension of the physician's medical license. The Canadian province of Ontario continues to have such a system, as of 2008. As the training, knowledge and skill level of paramedics increased, licensing and certification were formalized, and physicians became more comfortable in working with this new profession; then paramedics were permitted greater degrees of independent practice. In the 21st century, most paramedics function based on complex written protocols or standing orders committed to memory, often numerous pages in length, and contact a physician only when standing orders have been exhausted. In such systems, the medical director's role takes on several aspects. To begin with, the medical director is much more a leader of paramedics than of other physicians. They generally perform a leadership role among the small group of physicians tasked with providing delegation to paramedics in the field. The medical director plays a key role in the professional development of paramedics as well. In almost all cases, the medical director will have, at a minimum, input into the curriculum of paramedic training at a local level. In a great many cases, they will also teach some portions of the program, supervise clinical rotations of paramedics, and in some cases, precept their initial field practice, prior to formal certification or licensing. In almost all cases, the medical director will be charged with the creation of all protocols and standing orders, and with any research that goes into their creation. The medical director will also, assisted by others, be responsible for the creation and development of the Standards of Practice for their EMS system. Throughout the paramedic's career, the medical director will provide the mechanism for medical quality control, conducting chart audits and reviewing medically related service complaints, and may often have the ability to de-certify individual paramedics for cause. Medical directors will also act as advocates for their paramedics, advising elected officials and building support within the medical community for expanded scopes of practice when appropriate. Finally, medical directors will act as expert advisors to those in the EMS system administration and government administration, with respect to policies and legislation required by the EMS system, and in guiding its future direction. In this model, the paramedic is very much seen as an 'extender' of the emergency physician's reach. It is rare to see physicians in the field, unless they are precepting new paramedics or performing quality assurance activities, or are residents in emergency medicine training programs, gaining required field experience or conducting research. Medical directors and ED physicians will occasionally go into the field for large incidents, such as multi victim accidents and disasters to assume on site medical command. =Autonomous practice= In some parts of the world, most notably the U.K., Australia and South Africa some paramedics have evolved into a role of autonomous practitioners in their own right. In such cases, individual paramedics may function in much the same manner as Physician assistants or Nurse Practitioners, assessing patients and making their own diagnoses, clinical judgments, and treatment decisions. In all such cases, a scope of practice is predetermined for the role, and within that scope of practice all treatment decisions are made and care rendered at the discretion of the individual paramedic. In many cases, the scope of practice will focus more heavily on primary care, although providing a more comprehensive level of care, such as suturing, or the management of long-term conditions, such as diabetes or hypertension, than is normally permitted to the paramedic. In some jurisdictions, such practitioners even have the authority to both prescribe and dispense a limited and defined set of medications. In such circumstances, these Paramedic Practitioners or Emergency Care Practitioners are almost always very senior and experienced ALS providers, and retain their ability to practice these skills. In many cases, the practice of these individuals has gone well beyond what we normally consider to be the role of traditional EMS. There are locations in which these practitioners are providing E/R leadership after hours in small, rural hospitals (Australia and the U.K.), while in other locations these practitioners are actually taking night 'call' for group medical practices (U.K.). In some cases, the Practitioner retains the ability to summon a physician to the patient when the limits of the scope of practice are reached (U.K.) while in others, the finite limits of treatment are those within that scope of practice, and no physician 'back-up' is normally provided (South Africa). In this type of model, the role of the medical director includes the teaching of the practitioners, in both the classroom and the clinical setting. Most such training programs tend to feature very large components of hands-on clinical experience, generally conducted in the emergency room or similar environment, and usually in a one-to-one ratio with the physician. The medical director will be responsible for examination of the candidate and certification of their ability to practice safely. The medical director will have a major role in determining the permitted scope of practice, and will investigate practice-related complaints. In some jurisdictions the medical director will be responsible for medical quality assurance, although there are some where this function is performed by the practitioners themselves. Finally, the medical director (or other emergency physicians) may be responsible for providing the required medical 'back up' when the practitioner reaches the limit of their scope of practice. =Crossover models= There are some models, most notably the Netherlands, which use a blend of a number of these models, including the Franco-German, Anglo-American, and Autonomous Practice models. In Netherlands, for example, all paramedics are in fact registered nurses with one year of additional training, usually in anesthesia but other critical care training is also acceptable, who then complete an additional year of training in ambulance care. All such individuals are licensed by the Dutch Ambulance Institute(DIA), and are employed by one of approximately 45 private companies providing emergency ambulance service under government contract. The model looks very much Anglo-American on its surface, however, in most cases Dutch paramedics are for all practical purposes autonomous practitioners. The scope of practice and permissible procedures are determined at a national level by the Dutch Ambulance Institute, and all paramedics must function within this guidance. Within the scope of practice, however, all judgment and treatment decisions fall to the paramedic, as in the Autonomous Practitioner model. Each ambulance service is required to employ a medical manager whose role is oversight and quality assurance, and who may be contacted for directions by any paramedic who has reached the limits of their scope of practice, just as in the Anglo-American model. When necessary, however, the paramedic may request a rapid response by a physician, usually by either vehicle or helicopter. In these cases, a great deal of emergency intervention will occur on the scene, with the patient transported ultimately by land ambulance, as in the Franco-German model. In this model, which is unique, the role of the medical director is substantially different. Scope of practice and all treatment protocols are developed by the Dutch Ambulance Institute on a national basis, and cannot be unilaterally changed at the local level by individual physicians. Scope and protocols are reviewed, revised, and announced every four years, and any physician who wishes a change to those protocols must provide sound reasons and present a successful argument before a committee of the DIA. The medical managers for each private carrier operate in a role approximating that of medical director, but only for that one company; their authority does not extend to other companies operating in the same community. These individuals do perform quality service functions such as chart audits and complaint investigation, but they cannot unilaterally change treatment protocols. They may provide guidance, advice and direction to paramedics by telephone or radio, or they may attend the scene in person to provide care. The Dutch system also operates a network of four helicopters staffed by physicians for rapid response to support paramedics in the field. While many of the individuals working in the Dutch system may be occasionally described as 'emergency physicians', the majority, as in the Franco-German model, are actually anesthetists.

Evolved from the Indian subcontinent's torana through the introduction of Buddhism to China, it has developed many styles and has been introduced to other East Asian countries, such as Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Etymology The word paifang () was originally a collective term for the top two levels of administrative division and subdivisions of ancient Chinese cities. The largest division within a city in ancient China was a fang (), equivalent to a current day ward. Each fang was enclosed by walls or fences, and the gates of these enclosures were shut and guarded every night. Each fang was further divided into several pai (), which is equivalent to a current day (unincorporated) community. Each pai, in turn, contained an area including several hutongs (alleyways). This system of urban administrative division and subdivision reached an elaborate level during the Tang dynasty, and continued in the following dynasties. For example, during the Ming dynasty, Beijing was divided into a total of 36 fangs. Originally, the word paifang referred to the gate of a fang and the marker for an entrance of a building complex or a town; but by the Song dynasty, a paifang had evolved into a purely decorative monument. Origin The ancient torana is sacred gateway architecture found all over the Indian subcontinent. It has influenced the gateway architecture further across asia via the Silk Road transmission of Buddhism; Chinese paifang gateways Japanese torii gateways, Korean Hongsalmun gateway, and Sao Ching Cha in Thailand have been derived from the Indian torana. The functions of all are similar, but they generally differ based on their respective architectural styles. Chinese paifang derived from the torana temple-gate in ancient India,Joseph Needham, Science and Civilization in China, Vol 4 part 3, p137-138 has taken on traditional Chinese architectural characteristics such as multi-tiered roofs, various supporting posts, and archway-shapes of traditional gates and towers. During the Tang dynasty, it was called a wutoumen (), because the top of the two posts were painted black. A wutoumen was reserved for officials of rank 6 or higher. The construction of wutomen was standardized in the Yingzao Fashi of the mid Song dynasty. It consisted of two posts and a horizontal beam forming a frame and two doors. By the Ming and Qing dynasties, it was called a pailou or paifang, and evolved into a more elaborate structure with more posts and gates, with a superstructural gable on top; the highest rank was a five gate-six post-eleven gable pailou. Style Paifangs come in a number of forms. One form involves placing wooden pillars onto stone bases, which are bound together with wooden beams. This type of paifang is always beautifully decorated, with the pillars usually painted in red, the beams decorated with intricate designs and Chinese calligraphy, and the roof covered with coloured tiles, complete with mythical beasts‚Äîjust like a Chinese palace. Another form of paifang is in the form of true archways made of stone or bricks; the walls may be painted, or decorated with coloured tiles; the top of the archways are decorated like their wooden counterparts. Yet another form of paifang, built mainly on religious and burial grounds, consists of plain white stone pillars and beams, with neither roof tiles nor any coloured decoration, but feature elaborate carvings created by master masons. Another form is in the Han dynasty style, and is two matching towers, such as in Beihai. Outside of China, the paifang has long been the symbol of Chinatowns. The largest outside of China is in the United States: Friendship Archway at tall and wide, completed in 1986 at H and 7th in Washington D.C.'s Chinatown. In Europe, the largest paifang spans Nelson Street in Liverpool, completed in 2000 and standing tall. The first paifang in the United States was raised in 1915 as a temporary installation for the Chinese pavilion of the Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition in San Francisco, and the oldest still standing was erected in 1938 for Los Angeles, Chinatown West Gate on Hill Street; it was listed as a city Historic-Cultural Monument (#825) along with its counterpart, Chinatown East Gate (1939, #826) in November 2005. In the past, \\"Chastity Paifangs\\" were given to widows who remained unmarried till death, praising what was seen as loyalty to their deceased husbands.

Pulseless electrical activity is found initially in about 55% of people in cardiac arrest. Under normal circumstances, electrical activation of muscle cells precedes mechanical contraction of the heart (known as electromechanical coupling). In PEA, there is electrical activity, but the heart either does not contract or there are other reasons this results in an insufficient cardiac output to generate a pulse and supply blood to the organs. While PEA is classified as a form of cardiac arrest, significant cardiac output may still be present which may be determined and best visualized by bedside ultrasound. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is the first treatment for PEA, while potential underlying causes are identified and treated. The medication epinephrine may be administered. Survival is about 20%. Signs and symptoms Pulseless electrical activity leads to a loss of cardiac output, and the blood supply to the brain is interrupted. As a result, PEA is usually noticed when a person loses consciousness and stops breathing spontaneously. This is confirmed by examining the airway for obstruction, observing the chest for respiratory movement, and feeling the pulse (usually at the carotid artery) for a period of 10 seconds. Causes These possible causes are remembered as the 6 Hs and the 6 Ts. See Hs and Ts * Hypovolemia * Hypoxia * Hydrogen ions (Acidosis) * Hyperkalemia or Hypokalemia * Hypoglycemia * Hypothermia * Tablets or Toxins (Drug overdose) * Cardiac Tamponade * Tension pneumothorax * Thrombosis (e.g., myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism) * Tachycardia * Trauma (e.g., hypovolemia from blood loss) The possible mechanisms by which the above conditions can cause pulseless in PEA are the same as those recognized as producing circulatory shock states. These are (1) impairment of cardiac filling, (2) impaired pumping effectiveness of the heart, (3) circulatory obstruction and (4) pathological vasodilation causing loss of vascular resistance and excess capacitance. More than one mechanism may be involved in any given case. Diagnosis Pulseless electrical activity, it is possible to observe by invasive blood pressure (red) the transition from a normal mechanical activity of the heart, which progressively changes in rhythm and contractile quality to asystolia, even in the presence of normal electrical activity (green), also confirmed by the pulse oximeter detection even if with artifacts (blue) The absence of a pulse confirms a clinical diagnosis of cardiac arrest, but PEA can only be distinguished from other causes of cardiac arrest with a device capable of electrocardiography (ECG/EKG). In PEA, there is organised or semi-organised electrical activity in the heart as opposed to asystole (flatline) or to the disorganised electrical activity of either ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. Treatment Cardiac resuscitation guidelines (ACLS/BCLS) advise that cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be initiated promptly to maintain cardiac output until the PEA can be corrected. The approach in treatment of PEA is to treat the underlying cause, if known (e.g. relieving a tension pneumothorax). Where an underlying cause for PEA cannot be determined and/or reversed, the treatment of pulseless electrical activity is similar to that for asystole. There is no evidence that external cardiac compression can increase cardiac output in any of the many scenarios of PEA, such as hemorrhage, in which impairment of cardiac filling is the underlying mechanism producing loss of a detectable pulse. A priority in resuscitation is placement of an intravenous or intraosseous line for administration of medications. The mainstay of drug therapy for PEA is epinephrine (adrenaline) 1 mg every 3‚Äì5 minutes. Although previously the use of atropine was recommended in the treatment of PEA/asystole, this recommendation was withdrawn in 2010 by the American Heart Association due to lack of evidence for therapeutic benefit. Epinephrine too has a limited evidence base, and it is recommended on the basis of its mechanism of action. Sodium bicarbonate 1meq per kilogram may be considered in this rhythm as well, although there is little evidence to support this practice. Its routine use is not recommended for patients in this context, except in special situations (e.g. preexisting metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, tricyclic antidepressant overdose). All of these drugs should be administered along with appropriate CPR techniques. Defibrillators cannot be used to correct this rhythm, as the problem lies in the response of the myocardial tissue to electrical impulses.

The site was surveyed by Len Beadell in 1952. A village and airstrip were constructed for the subsequent testing program. The site was supported from the RAAF Woomera Range Complex. Two British nuclear weapon tests were conducted at the site. Totem 1 was detonated on 15 October 1953 and Totem 2 was detonated on 27 October 1953. The devices were both sited on towers and yielded 9 kilotons and 7 kilotons respectively.Michael Carter et al. (2006). Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests in Australia, Vol 1: Dosimetry, Commonwealth of Australia, p. 3. The site was also used in September‚ÄìOctober 1953 for some of the Kitten series of tests, which were conventional (rather than nuclear) explosions used to evaluate neutron initiators. It was later found that the radioactive cloud from the first detonation did not disperse as expected, and traveled north-east over the Australian continent. The site at Emu Field was unsafe for further testing due to contamination by nuclear radiation, and the search for another location led to the survey of Maralinga, where a further series of atomic tests was conducted in 1956. There are now stone monuments at the ground-zero points, which can be visited by tourists (with the written approval of the RAAF Woomera Test Range who now control access to the area), though the location is still extremely remote (see Anne Beadell Highway).

It was published first in the United States, in an abridged version, in September 1942 by Little, Brown and Company. Its publication was surrounded by a certain amount of fanfare; by the end of September, there were already plans for a comic strip version of The Seventh Cross, it having already been selected as a Book-of-the-Month Club book. According to Dorothy Rosenberg, who wrote the afterword for the 1987 Monthly Review Press edition, statistics indicate that 319,000 copies of The Seventh Cross were sold in the first twelve days alone, and the novel was printed in German, Russian, Portuguese, Yiddish and Spanish by 1943. A film version starring Spencer Tracy and produced by MGM premiered in 1944; a publicity stunt, in which MGM organized a pretend \\"manhunt\\" for a Tracy look- alike in seven cities for the public to take part in, accompanied the normal film promotions. After the end of the Nazi regime, the book was well received in Germany, and particularly in the East; the author, Seghers, was known to be a Communist, and some of the \\"heroic\\" or sympathetic characters in The Seventh Cross are also members of the Communist Party. The libretto of German composer Hans Werner Henze's Ninth Symphony is based on The Seventh Cross. The first full English translation, by Margot Bettauer Dembo, was published in 2018. Plot summary Seven men imprisoned in the fictitious Westhofen camp (based partly on the real Osthofen concentration camp) have decided to make a collaborative escape attempt. The main character is a Communist, George Heisler; the narrative follows his path across the countryside, taking refuge with those few who are willing to risk a visit from the Gestapo, while the rest of the escapees are gradually overtaken by their hunters. The title of the book comes from a conceit of the prison camp. The current officer in charge has ordered the creation of seven crosses from the trees nearby, to be used when the prisoners are returned ‚Äì not for crucifixion, but a subtler torture: the escapees are made to stand all day in front of their crosses, and will be punished if they falter.

Designed by architect Stanford White in 1892, it commemorates the centennial of George Washington's 1789 inauguration as President of the United States, and forms the southern terminus of Fifth Avenue. Description Washington Square Arch, constructed of white Tuckahoe marble, was conceived by Stanford White, who imitated a Roman Triumphal Arch, iconic monuments which Roman emperors built throughout the empire to celebrate a victory or event. Washington Square Arch stands 77 feet (23 m) high. The piers stand apart and the arch opening is high. The iconography of the Arch centers on images of war and peace. On the frieze are 13 large stars and 42 small stars, interspersed with capital \\"W\\"s. The spandrels contain figures of Victory. The inscription on the attic story reads: The north side of the eastern pier bears the sculpture George Washington as Commander-in-Chief, Accompanied by Fame and Valor (1914‚Äì1916) by Hermon A. MacNeil; the President is flanked by Fame (left) and Valor (right).

Stewart lived at 17 Washington Square North, and his friends contributed $2,765 toward the work. The temporary arch was so popular that more money was raised and three years later the permanent stone arch, designed by architect Stanford White, was erected.Buescher, John. \\"Architectural Homage.\\" Teachinghistory.org. Accessed July 12, 2011. During the excavations for the eastern pier, human remains, a coffin, and a gravestone dated 1803 were uncovered below ground level. The Arch was dedicated in 1895. In 1918, two statues of Washington were added to the north side. By the late 20th century, the Washington Square Arch had become extensively defaced with spray- painted graffiti. It was cleaned and restored in the 1980s. The arch has often been used as an unofficial symbol of New York University, as the buildings surrounding the square are owned by the institution.

It is an elongated mountain with a summit caldera filled with ice with numerous parasitic vents; a volcanic field surrounds the edifice. Mount Melbourne has a volume of about and consists of tephra deposits and lava flows; tephra deposits are also found encased within ice and have been used to date the last eruption of Mount Melbourne to . The volcano is considered inactive. The volcano is part of the McMurdo Volcanic Group, and together with The Pleiades, Mount Overlord, Mount Rittmann and the Malta Plateau forms a subprovince, the Melbourne volcanic province. The volcanism is related both to the West Antarctic Rift and to local tectonic structures such as faults and grabens. Mount Melbourne has mainly erupted trachyandesite and trachyte, which formed within a magma chamber; basaltic rocks are less common. Geothermal heat flow on Mount Melbourne has created a unique ecosystem formed by mosses and liverworts that grow between fumaroles, ice towers, and ice hummocks. This type of vegetation is found at other volcanoes of Antarctica and develops when volcanic heat generates meltwater from snow and ice, thus allowing plants to grow in the cold Antarctic environment. These mosses are particularly common in an area known as Cryptogam Ridge within and south of the summit caldera; Cryptogam Ridge is a protected area. Description Mount Melbourne lies in North Victoria Land, facing the Wood Bay of the Ross Sea. To the southeast lies Cape Washington and due south lies Terra Nova Bay; Campbell Glacier runs west from the volcano and Tinker Glacier lies north of the volcanic field. The seasonal Italian Zucchelli Station lies from the volcano; the Korean Jang Bogo Station and the German Gondwana Station are also in the area. The volcano and its summit can be accessed from the stations by helicopter. Mount Melbourne was first recognized as a volcano by James Ross in 1841 and named after then-prime minister of the United Kingdom Melbourne. The volcano and its surroundings were investigated by New Zealand-based parties in the 1960s, by German ones in the 1970‚Äì1980s and by Italian-based parties in the 1980s‚Äì1990s. = The volcano = Mount Melbourne is an elongated stratovolcano formed by lava flows and tephra fall deposits, with gentle slopes. The volcano is uneroded and forms an almost-perfect cone. Viewed from distance Mount Melbourne has a nearly perfect cone-like profile that has drawn comparisons to Mount Etna in Italy and Mount Ruapehu in New Zealand. Volcanic mounds, cones, lava domes and scoria cones dot its flanks; from the summit is a large parasitic vent on the north-northeastern slope, which generated several lava flows. Part of the edifice rises from below sea level. Pyroclastic flow deposits have also been reported, a rarity for Antarctic volcanoes. The total volume of the edifice is about . A caldera sits at the top of the volcano. The highest point of the volcano lies east-northeast of the caldera and reaches elevation. The caldera has an incomplete rim and is filled with snow, leaving a depression. The rim of the caldera is covered by volcanic ejecta including lapilli and lava bombs, probably the products of the most recent eruption of Mount Melbourne, which overlie a layer of pumice lapilli. Three small, nested craters formed by phreatomagmatic eruptions occur on the southern rim of the summit caldera. Pyroclastic fall deposits crop out in the northern rim of the caldera and there are more alternating lava-tephra sequences elsewhere in the summit region. There is evidence of past structural instability (collapse structures) on the eastern and southeastern flank, and an arcuate scarp on the eastern flank appears to be an incipient sector collapse. Except for geothermal areas, the ground is bouldery. Frost heave has been observed in the summit region. Small creeks flow down the eastern flank of Mount Melbourne; they are fed by meltwater during summer and quickly disappear with the snow. = Glaciation = The mountain is covered with permanent ice, which extends to the coast and leaves only a few exposures of the underlying rock; rocky outcrops are best exposed on the eastern flank. The caldera hosts a n√©v√© that generates a westward flowing glacier. An icefall lies northwest of the caldera. Glaciers emanating from snowfields on the volcano have deposited moraines; moraines and tills from both Pleistocene and Holocene glaciations crop out at Edmonson Point. Tephra layers crop out in ice cliffs and seracs and testify to recent eruptions, including the one that deposited the ejecta and lapilli pumice units on the summit. Tephra bands are also found in other glaciers of the region. They form when snow accumulates on top of tephra that fell onto ice and in the case of Mount Melbourne they indicate eruptions during the last few thousand years. Volcanic sediments from Mount Melbourne are also found in Terra Nova Bay. = The volcanic field = Mount Melbourne is surrounded by a volcanic field consisting of 60 exposed volcanoes, which have the form of scoria cones and tuff rings with hyaloclastite deposits, lava flows and pillow lavas. Some of these volcanoes formed under ice. The volcanic field forms a peninsula which is separated by steep faults from the Transantarctic Mountains to the north. Among these volcanoes is Shield Nunatak southwest from Mount Melbourne, a subglacial volcano, now exposed, that may have formed during the latest Pleistocene. The Cape Washington ridge consists mostly of lava, including pillow lava, overlaid by scoria cones, and is the remnant of a shield volcano. Edmonson Point is another volcanic complex in the system that formed partly while interacting with glaciers and partly through phreatomagmatic activity. Other volcanoes in the field are Baker Rocks, Oscar Point and Random Hills. These volcanoes are aligned mainly in north‚Äìsouth direction and include both edifices that formed above and under ice, with palagonitized outcrops that expose dikes. Perfectly preserved scoria cones occur at Pinckard Table north of the volcanic field, while Harrow Peak is a heavily eroded lava plug. The total volume of volcanic rocks is about and their emplacement apparently altered the path of the Campbell Glacier. Topographic map of Mount Melbourne (1:250,000 scale) from USGS Mount Melbourne  Geology  West Antarctic Rift system in the Ross Sea Mount Melbourne is part of the McMurdo Volcanic Group and together with Mount Erebus one of its active volcanoes. This volcanic group is one of the largest alkaline volcanic provinces in the world, comparable with that of the East African Rift, and is subdivided into the Melbourne, the Hallett and the Erebus volcanic provinces. The volcanic group consists of large shield volcanoes mainly near the coasts, stratovolcanoes and monogenetic volcanoes which formed parallel to the Transantarctic Mountains. Volcanic activity of the McMurdo Volcanic Group is tied to continental rifting and commenced during the Oligocene. Whether the volcanism is caused by a mantle plume or by the tectonics of the West Antarctic Rift is unclear. The latter is one of the largest continental rifts on Earth but little known and possibly inactive today. The Ross Sea and the Victoria Land Basin developed along this rift and were deeply buried, while the Transantarctic Mountains were rapidly uplifted during the last 50 million years and are on the \\"shoulder\\" of the rift. The line separating the two is a major crustal suture, with large differences in elevation and crustal thickness across the suture. Many of the volcanoes appear to have formed under the influence of fault zones in the area, and increased activity in the last 30 million years has been correlated to the reactivation of faults. It is part of a volcano alignment that includes The Pleiades, Mount Overlord, Mount Rittmann‚Äîall large stratovolcanoes‚Äî which with the Malta Plateau form the Melbourne province of the McMurdo Volcanic Group. In addition, this province consists of numerous smaller volcanic centres, volcanic intrusions and sequences of volcanic rocks, and has been active for the past 25 million years. Volcanic edifices buried under sediment are also part of the Melbourne province, including a cone southeast from Cape Washington, which has a size comparable to that of Mount Melbourne. Mount Melbourne and its volcanic field are over a basement of Precambrian to Ordovician age, which consists of volcanic and metamorphic rocks of the Wilson Terrane. The volcano is at the intersection of three geological structures: the Rennick Graben of Cretaceous age, the Victoria Land Basin and the Polar 3 magnetic anomaly, which has been interpreted to be either a transform fault or a push-up structure formed by faulting. The Terror Rift in the Victoria Land Basin runs between Mount Melbourne and Mount Erebus and appears to be related to their existence. The volcano appears to rise in a graben whose marginal faults are still active with earthquakes, on the eastern flank of Mount Melbourne. North‚Äìsouth- trending faulting may also be responsible for the north‚Äìsouth-like trend in edifice structure, and strike-slip faulting takes place on the eastern flank. Holocene coastal uplift in the area indicates that tectonic activity is still ongoing. Low seismic velocity anomalies have been found underneath Mount Melbourne and are connected to similar anomalies under the Terror Rift. These anomalies above depth are focused under Mount Melbourne and the neighbouring Priestley Fault. A low gravity anomaly over Mount Melbourne may reflect either the presence of low-density volcanic rocks or of a magma chamber under the volcano. = Composition = Trachyandesite and trachyte are the most common rocks on Mount Melbourne, with basalt being less common and mostly occurring around its base. The rocks define a mildly alkaline suite rich in potassium unlike the rocks elsewhere in the volcanic field. The rest of the volcanic field also features alkali basalts, basanite and mugearite. Phenocrysts include aegirine, amphibole, anorthoclase, augite, clinopyroxene, hedenbergite, ilmenite, magnetite, olivine, plagioclase and sanidine. Gneiss, granulite, harzburgite, lherzolite and tholeiite xenoliths are found in the volcanic field and form the core of many lava bombs. Inclusions in xenoliths indicate that the gaseous components of the Mount Melbourne volcanic field magmas consist mainly of carbon dioxide. The trachytes and mugearites formed through magmatic differentiation in a crustal magma chamber from alkali basalts, defining an alkali basalt-trachyte differentiation series. Basalts were mainly erupted early in the history of the volcano. During the last 100,000 years, the magma chamber became established; this allowed both the differentiation of trachytes and the occurrence of large eruptions. A gap in the rock spectrum (\\"Daly gap\\") with a scarcity of benmoreite and mugearite has been noted at Mount Melbourne and other volcanoes in the region. There is no agreement on which processes contributed to petrogenesis in the Mount Melbourne volcanic field. The magmatic system that feeds Mount Melbourne appears to have a distinct composition from the one associated with the Mount Melbourne volcanic field. Hydrothermal alteration has affected parts of the summit area, leaving yellow and white deposits that contrast with the black volcanic rocks. Hydrothermal sinter deposits have formed in geothermal areas from past liquid water flow. Clay containing allophane, amorphous silica, allophane and feldspar are found in the summit area.  Eruption history  Mount Melbourne was active during the last 3‚Äì2.7 million years. Activity has been subdivided into an older Pliocene Cape Washington stage, an early Pleistocene Random Hills stage, the 400,000‚Äì100,000 years old Shield Nunatak stage and the recent Mount Melbourne stage. Volcanic activity migrated north from Cape Washington towards the Transantarctic Mountains and eventually became centralized at Mount Melbourne. Mount Melbourne during the last 100,000 years has produced about of magma. = Mount Melbourne volcanic field = Ages obtained on the Mount Melbourne volcanic field include 2.96¬±0.2 million years, 740,000¬±100,000 years and 200,000¬±40,000 years for Baker Rocks, 2.7¬±0.2 million years and 450,000¬±50,000 years for Cape Washington, 74,000¬±110,000 years and 50,000¬±20,000 years for Edmonson Point, less than 400,000 years for Markham Island, 745,000¬±66,000 years for Harrows Peak, 1.368¬±0.09 million years for Pinkard Table, 1.55¬±0.05 million years, 431,000¬±82,000 and 110,000¬±70,000 years for Shield Nunatak, and 2.5¬±0.1 million years for Willows Nunatak. The northeastern parasitic cone formed after the bulk of the volcano and appears to be younger than the summit of Mount Melbourne. Radiometric dating has shown that the appearance of a landform at Mount Melbourne is not indicative of its age; some well preserved vents are older than heavily eroded ones. On the other hand, a lack of proper margins of error and lack of details on which samples were dated has been problematic for radiometric dating efforts. = Tephra = Tephra found at the Allan Hills, in Dome C and Siple Dome ice cores may come from Mount Melbourne. Additional tephra layers attributed to the volcano are: * Less than 500,000 years old tephra layers in the Frontier Mountain and Lichen Hills blue-ice areas have been attributed to volcanoes in the Mount Melbourne volcanic province. * A less than 30,000 years old tephra layer in a sediment core from the Ross Sea has a composition indicating that it was erupted at Mount Melbourne. Its deposition has been used to infer that that part of the western Ross Sea was ice-free at that time. * A tephra layer found in the Ross Sea has been interpreted as originating from an eruption of Mount Melbourne 9,700¬±5,300 years ago. * In the Talos Dome ice core record, two tephra layers emplaced 2,680 and 5,280 years ago have compositions similar to these of Mount Melbourne. * Tephra layers at Siple Dome indicate eruptions at Mount Melbourne 304 CE, which deposited substantial amounts of sulfate on the ice sheet. * A tephra layer at Siple Dome dated to 1810 CE might have been erupted by Mount Melbourne, but its attribution is less certain than for the 304 CE tephra. = Mount Melbourne proper = The Edmonson Point ignimbrite is a trachytic ignimbrite that crops out at Edmonson Point. It consists of three units of ash-supported, lapilli- and pumice-rich deposits with intercalated breccia lenses that reach a thickness of . They are two ignimbrite units separated by a base surge deposit. Faulting has offset the sequences, which are intruded by dikes. The Edmonson Point ignimbrite was produced by large Plinian eruptions and is about 120,000 years old. The eruption deposited tephra into the Ross Sea, and correlative tephra layers were found in the Talos Dome ice core. After this ignimbrite, a series of dikes gave rise to the probably subglacial Adelie Penguin Rookery lava field. This lava field is formed by numerous blocky lava flows with glassy margins that reach a total thickness of and are formed by hawaiite and benmoreite. They were fed through numerous dikes, which also gave rise to small scoria cones and spatter cones, and were emplaced non- contemporaneously. A tuff cone rises from the lava field and is formed by monogenetic volcano ejecta, including lava bombs encasing granite fragments and bombs large enough to leave craters in the ash they fell in. Ropy basalt lava flows with an uncertain source vent, and a undissected scoria cone rise above the lava field and complete the Edmonson Point system. The Adelie Penguin Rookery lava field was erupted about 90,000 years ago, and its emplacement may have been accompanied by the emission of tephra recorded in the Talos Dome ice core. Rocks at the summit have ages of between 260,000 and 10,000 years. Individual eruptions have been dated to 10,000¬±20,000, 80,000¬±15,000, 260,000¬±60,000 and 15,000¬±35,000 years ago. Highly inprecise ages of late Pleistocene to Holocene age have been obtained from the ejecta layer on the summit. = Last eruption and present-day activity = The last eruption was a few centuries ago, and tephrochronology has yielded an age of 1892¬±30 CE for it. This eruption deposited a major tephra layer around the volcano, which crops out mainly on its eastern side. The three small craters on the rim of the Mount Melbourne summit crater formed at the end of this eruption. No eruptions have been observed during historical time, and the volcano is considered to be quiescent and a low-hazard volcano. Ongoing deformation and seismic activity occurs at Mount Melbourne, and the latter may be caused either by the movement of fluids underground or by fracturing processes. Geothermal activity has been steady between 1963 and 1983, while ground deformation commenced in 1997. This deformation was probably caused by changes in the geothermal system. = Hazards and monitoring = Future moderate explosive eruptions are possible. The prevailing winds would transport volcanic ash eastward across the Ross Sea, and the ash might impact research stations close to Mount Melbourne such as Mario Zucchelli, Gondwana and Jang Bogo. The hazards of Antarctic volcano eruptions are poorly known. Mount Melbourne is remote, and thus renewed eruptions would likely not impact any human habitations, but regional environmental or even global climate impacts are possible. Italian scientists began a volcanology research program on Mount Melbourne in the late 1980s, establishing a volcanological observatory in 1988. In 1990 they installed seismic stations around Mount Melbourne and between 1999 and 2001 a network of geodetic measurement stations around Terra Nova Bay, including several aimed at monitoring the Mount Melbourne volcano. Beginning in 2012, Korean scientists at the Jang Bogo Station added another seismic station network to monitor the volcano.  Geothermal activity  Geothermal activity occurs around the summit crater, on the upper parts of the volcano and on the northwestern slope between elevation. Another geothermal area exists close to Edmonson Point, including fumaroles, thermal anomalies and freshwater ponds. Their temperatures of are considerably higher than normal atmospheric temperatures in Antarctica. The geothermal areas are visible in infrared light from aircraft. Satellite images have identified areas with temperatures of over . Individual geothermally heated areas cover surfaces of a few hectares. Typically, the soil consists of a thin sand layer with organic matter covering scoria gravel. In some places, the ground is too hot to be touched. Mount Melbourne is one of several volcanoes in Antarctica that feature such geothermal soils. Fumarolic landforms include ice towers, fumaroles, ice \\"roofs\\", caves in snow and firn, bare ground, ice hummocks surrounding fumarolic vents, puddles formed by condensed water vapour and steaming ground: * Ice hummocks are hollow glacial structures that encase fumaroles. They reach heights of and widths of . They mainly form over colder ground and widely spaced fumarolic vents. * Ice towers are widespread around the caldera, especially in the north-northwestern and south-southeastern sectors, while warm ground is more restricted. In the northern sector of the volcano, ice towers and bare ground form a southeast‚Äìnorthwest trending lineament. Ice towers form when fumarolic gases freeze in the cold Antarctic air. * Glacial caves form when geothermal heat melted ice, leaving cavities. Some of these caves are in the summit caldera and reach lengths of several hundred metres, with ceilings reaching height. Several caves have been accessed through ice towers or through gaps where the ice surrounding the cave rests on rock. The caves and ice towers release water vapour-rich warm air. Fumarole temperatures can reach , contrasting with the cold air. Hydrogen sulfide gas has been detected in fumaroles but is not common, facilitating the development of vegetation. Yellow deposits have been identified as sulfur. The geothermal manifestations appear to be powered mainly by steam, as there is no evidence of geothermal landforms related to liquid water flow and heat conduction is not effective enough at most sites. It is possible that underground liquid water reservoirs form in some areas, however. The steam is produced by the melting and evaporation of snow and ice, and is then channelled through rocks to the vents. Atmospheric air likely circulates underground and is heated, eventually exiting in ice towers.  Climate  There are no detailed meteorological records of the summit region. Winds blow mostly from the west and more rarely from the northwest. Catabatic winds blow from the Priestly and Reeves valleys. Precipitation is scarce. During winter, polar night lasts about three months. Temperatures not exceeding or of have been recorded in the summit region. Seasonal temperature variation is high and reaches . As part of climate change, temperatures on the Antarctic Peninsula have increased while the interior continent has cooled; at Mount Melbourne temperature declined between 1989 and 1998. During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), a marine ice sheet occupied Terra Nova Bay. The \\"Terra Nova Drift\\" was deposited between 25,000 and 7,000 years ago and is overlaid by later moraines from retreating ice during the post-LGM period. During the late Holocene after 5,000 years before present, glaciers advanced again as part of the Neoglacial. One minor advance occurred in the last 650 years.  Life  Algae, lichens, liverworts and mosses grow on geothermally heated terrain on the upper parts of Mount Melbourne. Algae form crusts on the heated ground. Mosses form cushions and often occur around steam vents and under ice hummocks. The moss species Campylopus pyriformis does not grow leaves on Mount Melbourne. Pohlia nutans forms small shoots. The two moss species form separate stands that occur at different sites of the volcano. Together with occurrences at Mount Erebus, they constitute the highest mosses growing in Antarctica. Small peat deposits have been found. Vegetation is particularly common on a ridge within and south of the main crater, \\"Cryptogam Ridge\\". It features a long snow-free area with a gravelly ground, small terraces and stone stripes. Soil temperatures recorded there reach . These are the only occurrences of Campylopus pyriformis on warm ground in Antarctica. Mount Melbourne along with Mount Erebus, Mount Rittmann and Deception Island is one of four volcanoes in Antarctica known for having geothermal habitats, although other poorly studied volcanoes such as Mount Berlin, Mount Hampton and Mount Kauffman may also have them. In South America, similar high-elevation geothermal environments to Mount Melbourne are found at Socompa. Vegetation on geothermally heated terrain is unusual in Antarctica but other occurrences exist, such as on Bouvet, Deception Island, Mount Erebus and the South Sandwich Islands. Such systems are unusual for the continent. The geothermal area at the summit of Mount Melbourne makes up Antarctic Specially Protected Area 118, which contains two specially restricted areas around Cryptogam Ridge and some markers used in studies of volcano deformation. Some algae from Mount Melbourne were accidentally transferred to Deception Island or Mount Erebus. Edmonson Point and Cape Washington have Adelie penguin rookeries and south polar skuas and Weddel seals are also found. Over 24 lichen plus six moss species including Bryum argenteum moss has been found at Edmonson Point, as well as microbial mats formed by cyanobacteria. Nematodes and collembola complete its biota. = Biology = The vegetation on Mount Melbourne grows mainly on terrain heated to temperatures of over , and there are gradations in vegetation type from colder to warmer temperatures. There are differences between the vegetation and bacterial communities at Cryptogam Ridge and these on the northwest slope of Mount Melbourne; distinct soils may be the reason for such differences. These communities must have reached Mount Melbourne from far away. Transport was probably by wind as there is no flowing water in the region. Mount Melbourne was recently active, is south of the Antarctic Circle thus has a polar night lasting 13 weeks, and having soils that contain toxic elements such as mercury, the volcano is distant from ecosystems that could be the source of colonization events and away from the westerlies, which may explain why the vegetation is species-poor. Pohlia nutans may have arrived only recently on Mount Melbourne, or this volcano is not as favourable for its growth as Mount Rittmann, where this moss is more common. Its colonies are less vigorous on Mount Melbourne than Campylopus pyriformis. Condensing fumarole gases and meltwater from snow form the water supply of this vegetation. Mosses are concentrated around fumarolic vents as there is more freshwater available there. The steam freezes in the cold air, forming the ice hummocks that act as a shelter and maintain stable humidity and temperature. The geothermal heating and the availability of freshwater sets these volcanic biological communities apart from other Antarctic vegetation communities that are heated by the Sun. Some bacterial species are nitrogen fixing. Genetic analysis has found that the mosses at Mount Melbourne might be evolving, yielding genetic variation. The hot, wet soils at Mount Melbourne host thermophilic organisms, making Mount Melbourne an island of thermophilic life on an ice-cold continent. Cold-tolerant microbes coexist with the thermophiles. Other species associated with the vegetation are the protozoan Corythion dubium, which is a testate amoeba common in Antarctica and the only invertebrate found in the geothermal habitats of Mount Melbourne, actinobacteria and various actinomycetes and fungal genera. Several bacterial species were first described from Mount Melbourne's geothermal terrains: * Alicyclobacillus pohliae from the northwest slope. * Aneurinibacillus terranovensis from Cryptogam Ridge and also from Mount Rittmann volcano. * Bacillus fumarioli from Cryptogam Ridge. * Bacillus thermoantarcticus from Cryptogam Ridge, later renamed to Bacillus thermantarcticus. A further reclassification to Geobacillus thermantarcticus was proposed in 2012. * Brevibacillus levickii from the northwest slope.

Retrieved: December 17, 2014. Events are depicted which point to the Battle of Gazala, an important battle of the Western Desert Campaign, fought around the port of Tobruk in Libya. Bogart makes reference to events that occurred in May‚ÄìJune 1942. The battle had begun with the British stronger in terms of both numbers and quality of equipment, after having received many of the American M3 tanks (also the tank seen in the film). A small group of American advisors and crews trained the British in the use of the equipment. The British forces were routed, and as shown in Sahara, many tanks were damaged, but were unable to be salvaged due to the 8th Army's retreat. The British lost virtually all their tanks, although a small number were evacuated. General Rommel pursued the British into Egypt, trying to keep British forces under pressure and denying them the opportunity to regroup. As both sides neared exhaustion, the British were able to check Rommel's advance at the First Battle of El Alamein. Bogart's character and his M3 crew are able to rally before hearing a radio report about the British victory.Barr 2005, p. 39. Plot The crew of Lulu Belle, a U.S. Army M3 Lee tank attached to the British Eighth Army and commanded by Master Sergeant Joe Gunn, become separated from their unit during a general retreat from German forces after the fall of Tobruk. Heading south across the Libyan Desert to rejoin the rest of their unit, Gunn and his crew, Doyle and \\"Waco\\", come across a bombed-out field hospital, where they pick up British Army medical officer Captain Halliday, four Commonwealth soldiers and Free French Corporal Leroux. Halliday, the only officer, cedes command to the more experienced Gunn. Riding on the tank, the group soon comes upon Sudanese Sergeant Major Tambul and his Italian prisoner, Giuseppe. Tambul volunteers to lead them to a well at Hassan Barani. Gunn insists that they leave the Italian behind, but, after driving a few hundred feet, Gunn relents and lets Giuseppe join them. En route, Luftwaffe pilot Captain von Schletow strafes the tank, seriously wounding Clarkson, one of the British soldiers. The German fighter aircraft is shot down and von Schletow is captured. Arriving at Hassan Barani, the group finds the well is dry, and Clarkson succumbs to his wounds. Tambul guides them to another desert well at Bir Acroma, but it provides only a trickle of water. While the group collect as much water as they can, German scouts arrive in a half-track. Gunn captures two of the men and learns that a German mechanized battalion, desperate for water, is following close behind. Gunn persuades the Allies to make a stand to delay the Germans while Waco takes the half-track for reinforcements. The two German soldiers are released to carry back an offer to their commander to swap food for water, even though there is little water left. When the German battalion arrives, a battle of wills begins between Gunn and the German commander, Major von Falken. By now the well has run dry, but Gunn keeps up the pretense and changes his offer to swap water for guns to buy time. The Germans reject the terms and mount several attacks. They are beaten off, but the Allied defenders are picked off one by one. During one attack, von Schletow stabs Giuseppe when the Italian refuses to help him escape and denounces fascism. Before he dies, Giuseppe manages to warn Gunn. Tambul chases von Schletow down and kills him before he can tell the Germans the truth about the well, but Tambul is shot dead. After a second parley with von Falken ends in another stalemate, von Falken has his men shoot Leroux in the back as the Frenchman returns to his own side. Gunn and his men return fire, killing von Falken. The Germans begin what appears to be a final assault but turns into a full-blown surrender. They drop their weapons and claw across the sand towards the well. To Gunn's shock, a German shell that exploded near the well has tapped into a hidden source of water, filling the well. While the surviving Germans drink, Gunn and Bates, the only Allied survivors, disarm them. Later, as they march their prisoners east, Gunn and Bates are met by Allied troops guided by Waco. They receive news of the Allied victory at the First Battle of El Alamein, turning back Rommel's Afrika Korps. Cast Production The lead role was initially offered to Gary Cooper, Glenn Ford and Brian Donlevy before Bogart.Niemi, Robert. \\"One Hundred Great War Movies.\\" ABC-CLIO.

Variety, however, reported that Donlevy was tired of making war films and Bogart was weary of gangster roles, so the actors swapped assignments; Donlevy stepped into My Friend Curley (released as Once Upon a Time in 1944) and Bogart took Somewhere in the Sahara (the film's working title).Variety 20 Jan 1943 : 4. Production began on 29 January 1943, and wrapped on 17 April 1943. The cast and crew spent eleven weeks on location in the Imperial County, California, portion of the Anza- Borrego Desert State Park near the Salton Sea. Their base was at the Planter's Hotel in Brawley, Calif., about 50 miles (80 km) east of the location. Soldiers and equipment of the U.S. 4th Armored Division, then in training at the Desert Training Center, were used as extras.Koyen, Kenneth. \\"War in the Sahara, Bogart Style.\\" Eve's Magazine, 2001. Retrieved: December 17, 2014. The soldiers were billeted in tents at the location. The American tank, nicknamed \\"Lullubelle,\\" was a 28-ton (25.4 t) medium tank with 30 and 50 caliber machine guns and a 75 millimeter canon. The tank required 100 octane fuel. Because no German equipment was available for the production, U.S. equipment was substituted and dressed with German markings. The aircraft that attacks the tank was an early Allison-powered P-51 Mustang. The German Sdkf-251 half-track and MG-34 machine guns were an American M2 with a M49 ring mounted with a Vickers medium machine gun. In 1992, Kurt Kreuger was quoted by the San Francisco Chronicle on the emotions inherent in making the film, in which he portrayed a stereotypical Nazi: > I was running across the dunes when Tambul jumped on top of me and pressed > my head into the sand to suffocate me.

It lies from Ross Island. Mount Morning rises to an elevation of and is almost entirely mantled with snow and ice. A wide summit caldera lies at the top of the volcano and several ice-free ridges such as Hurricane Ridge and Riviera Ridge emanate from the summit. A number of parasitic vents mainly in the form of cinder cones dot the mountain. The volcano was initially active during the Miocene and erupted in two separate stages with a hiatus in between. The older stage has a different chemical composition than the recent one and is heavily eroded by glaciers. The most recent parasitic vents were active about 20,000 years ago and the volcano could erupt again.  Geography and geomorphology  Mount Morning lies in Victoria Land, about from Ross Island and at the foot of the Transantarctic Mountains. The Koettlitz Glacier runs along the northwestern foot of Mount Morning and separates it from the Royal Society Range away. The volcano rises to above sea level and is capped by a wide caldera. Mount Morning has been defined as a large shield volcano that consists of a central volcano overlying an older volcanic complex. Fissure vents have produced at least 185 parasitic vents on the slopes of Mount Morning. They are cinder cones, fissure ridges, lava domes and volcanic necks, and their diameters range from a few metres to a few hundred metres. Many of the vents form alignments, some cone craters overlap or the vents themselves have linear shapes. These linear patterns defne northeast-southwest trends, with a minor northwest-southeast alignment. Lava flows emanate from cones and make up the present-day surface of the volcano. Mount Morning is almost entirely covered with snow and ice except where it is ablated by southerly winds. Outcrops of volcanic rocks are found at the north-northeastern Riviera Ridge and northeastern Hurricane Ridge on the northern flank, Mason Spur on the southern flank and on Helms Bluff on the eastern flank. Gandalf Ridge is a promontory at the foot of Hurricane Ridge, and Pinnacle Valley is located on the Riviera Ridge. Dikes, lava domes, lava flows and pyroclastic deposits are found in outcrops. Mason Spur also contains breccias from pillow lavas, while Gandalf Ridge features a diamictite and a cross-cutting fault. Owing to the lack of running water, the edifice is uneroded and parasitic vents have a young appearance. Glacial erosion has eroded some parts of the volcano, leaving volcanic necks in Pinnacle Valley, has etched glacial striations into exposed volcanic rocks and deposited glacial till. The Vereyken Glacier descends the northeastern slopes of Mount Morning between Hurricane Ridge and Riviera Ridge. Moraines occur on these two ridges and moraines dating to the Wisconsin glaciation have been reported. Glaciers descending from Mount Morning feed the Koettlitz Glacier.Several lakes are found on the volcano and at its foot, including Lake Morning at the end of the Riviera Ridge. Topographic map of Mounts Morning and Discovery (1:250,000 scale) from USGS Mount Discovery  Geology  The West Antarctic Rift is a major geological feature in Antarctica and one of Earth's largest continental rifts. It is a region of active crustal extension and spreading, which may be ongoing today. Volcanic activity occurs at the rift and includes the McMurdo Volcanic Group, a long chain of volcanoes in Victoria Land. This volcanic group has erupted alkaline lavas during the course of the Cenozoic. It is subdivided into three provinces, the Hallett, the Melbourne and the Erebus province; Mount Morning is the southernmost volcano of the Erebus province. Mount Morning rises from a Paleozoic basement, the Koettlitz Group which crops out close to Gandalf Ridge in the form of granite and metasedimentary rocks. = Composition = Basanite is the dominant rock of outcrops, with phonolite less common and picrobasalt and tephrite rare. Outcrops of older rocks include mugearite, rhyolite and trachyte. Textures range from porphyritic to seriate. Various phenocrysts are found within the volcanic rocks, including aegirine, augite, clinopyroxene, alkali feldspar, kaersutite, nepheline, olivine, plagioclase, quartz and sanidine. Aegirine, aenigmatite, amphibole, augite, clinopyroxene, alkali feldspar, glass, iron oxide-titanium oxide, nepheline, plagioclase and quartz make up the groundmass. The volcanic rocks contain xenoliths consisting of syenite and of rocks from older stages of Mount Morning activity. Spinel peridotite and less commonly clinopyroxenite, dunite, harzburgite, lherzolite, norite, pyroxenite and websterite have been reported as xenoliths. The early volcanic rocks of Mount Morning are comparable to mildly alkaline rocks from Mount Melbourne, while the more alkaline late volcanic rocks resemble these from Mount Erebus. Basaltic rocks are concentrated on the lower slopes, while phonolite is mainly found in the upper sector of Mount Morning. The composition changes between the early and late volcanic activity of Mount Morning may be due to alteration in crustal magma processes.  Eruption history  Mount Morning has been active during the Miocene, Pliocene and Pleistocene. Argon-argon dating and potassium-argon dating have been used to infer the duration of volcanic activity at Mount Morning. Gandalf Ridge has yielded ages of 18.7¬±0.3-15.5¬±0.5 million years, Pinnacle Valley 15.2¬±0.2-13.0¬±0.3 million years, Mason Spur 12.8¬±0.4-11.4¬±0.2 million years, rocks below the summit of 6.13¬±0.20-~1.00 million years and 4.51¬±0.31-0.02 million years on other formations. Some of these eruptions may have deposited volcanic ash over the McMurdo Sound area. Even older activity at Mount Morning may be recorded in volcanic deposits from Cape Roberts which go back to 24.1 million years ago. This is a long lifespan for a volcano by Antarctic standards, and may be due to tectonic factors that kept magma generation focused on Mount Morning for a long time. Loading by glaciers may have influenced volcanic activity at Mount Morning. Volcanic activity has been subdivided into two phases separated by a hiatus, an early phase lasting between 11.4¬±0.2-18.7¬±0.3 million years ago and a late phase from 6.13¬±0.02 million years ago to almost present-day. These phases are also known as the phase I or the Mason Spur Lineage, and as the phase II or the Riviera Ridge Lineage. The early phase produced mildly alkaline volcanic rocks, the late phase which makes up most of the outcrops strongly alkaline rocks. The older rocks have undergone significant glaciation, while the younger ones are largely uneroded and make up the present-day edifice. Volcanic activity mostly occurred under the atmosphere, with the exception of some lavas that may have been erupted in a subaqueous environment and hyaloclastites which have been used to infer that glaciers existed there 15.4 million years ago. Volcanic activity was focused along geologic lineaments on Mount Morning, which were reused during more recent eruptions. Eruptions took place at Mount Morning about 20,000 years ago, forming well-preserved cinder cones. In the 1960s thermal anomalies were observed at Gandalf Ridge, implying that the volcano may still be active, although ground surveys did not detect fumarolic activity. Thus, Mount Morning was considered dormant by Martin, Cooper and Dunlap 2010 and might be the source of tephra layers found in the area.  History and name  The volcano was discovered by the Discovery Expedition in 1901-1904 and named after a relief ship that took part in the expedition.

It is named for Richard S. Moulton, chief dog driver at West Base. The volcano is of Pliocene age and is presently inactive. The Prahl Crags are located on the southern slopes of Mount Moulton and are part of a caldera. There, an exposed area of blue ice can be found; this ice contains tephra layers from mainly neighbouring Mount Berlin volcano and some of the ice is almost half a million years old.  Geology and geomorphology  Mount Moulton lies in Marie Byrd Land of Western Antarctica and in the region of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. It is part of a system of volcanoes including Mount Berlin, Mount Takahe and Mount Waesche as well as of recently active subglacial volcanism. The volcano is named for Richard S. Moulton, chief dog driver of the United States Antarctic Service Expedition; the western end of the Flood Range where Mount Moulton lies was visited by this expedition in December 1940. alt= The volcano appears to be of Pliocene age. Only a few outcrops of Mount Moulton have been dated and these yield ages of 5.3 million years, with further age estimates of 4.9 ‚Äì 4.7 million years ago and 5.9 million years ago; there is no evidence of eruptive or thermal activity unlike at its neighbour Mount Berlin. Earthquakes have been recorded at Mount Moulton and are either of volcano-tectonic origin or due to the movement of ice along the flanks of the volcano. The mountain is high, rising about above the ice surface on its northern flank, and located within the Flood Range; Mount Berlin lies across the Wells Saddle to the west and Kohler Dome is east of Moulton. Even farther east lie Mount Bursey, Mount Andrus, Mount Kosciuszko and Mount Kauffman, in the Ames Range. Mount Moulton is formed by a complex of glaciated but largely uneroded shield volcanoes with ice-filled calderas, each of which is about wide. The calderas are apart. Additionally the Prahl Crags ‚Äì remnants of the former caldera rim ‚Äì are found south, Gawne Nunatak west, Edwards Spur northeast and the Moulton Icefalls on the northern side of the mountain. The total volume of the complex is about , comparable to that of Mount Shasta in the Cascade Range, and is one of the largest volcanoes in the Flood Range and Ames Range. Volcanic rocks found at Mount Moulton include pantellerite, phonolite and trachyte; phenocryst phases found in the pantellerite include aenigmatite, anorthoclase, fayalite, hedenbergite, ilmenite and quartz.  Blue ice field  A blue ice field has formed within the caldera of Mount Moulton behind the Prahl Crags, and contains ice almost 500,000 years old. It is the oldest dated ice in West Antarctica and much older than ice found elsewhere in West Antarctic ice cores. Such blue ice fields like those found at Mount Moulton form when glaciers run into an obstacle ‚Äì in this case the Prahl Crags ‚Äì and part of the ice starts moving vertically as it undergoes ablation processes like sublimation. In the case of Mount Moulton, this outcrop of ice is about long. The ice has been used to reconstruct past climate states in West Antarctica, including the beginning and end of the last interglacial, and shows evidence that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet collapsed during that interglacial. In addition, recognizable tephra layers are found in this ice and appear to originate from explosive eruptions of volcanoes such as Mount Berlin, Mount Takahe and Mount Waesche. These tephra layers at Mount Moulton crop out in parallel layers and geochemical traits indicate an origin at Mount Berlin although some layers may have been erupted from mafic volcanoes at Mount Moulton and Mount Berlin. Furthermore, the appearance of the deposits indicates that the eruptions of Mount Berlin were highly explosive. Most likely they eventually fell onto the ice of Mount Moulton, were incorporated in it and then transported downward to the blue ice field.

After leaving politics, Linda Smith founded Shared Hope International, a nonprofit organization to rescue and restore women and children in crisis. Since its creation, Smith has worked around the world and within the United States on behalf of those who have been victimized through sex trafficking. Early and personal life Smith grew up in a working class home. Her father abandoned the family and her mother remarried a mechanic, and in 1966 moved the family to Vancouver, Washington. Linda has an older sister, two younger sisters, and two younger brothers. In high school she had part-time jobs as a fruit picker and a day-care aide. She later recalled, \\"I felt like by 17, I had had more lives than most people.\\" She was 24 years old when her mother died of cancer, leaving her two younger brothers at home. Her step father remarried a few months later. In 1968, she married Vern Smith, a young locomotive engineer, shortly before the age of 18, and they raised two children. She became the manager of a number of independent tax offices in Southern Washington. She currently lives in Vancouver with her husband, and has two children and six grandchildren. Political career Smith began her political career in a special election in 1983 when she defeated a Democratic Party incumbent to win a seat in the Washington House of Representatives. In 1987, she moved up to the state Senate, giving Republicans control of that chamber, and remained there until her supporters began a September 1994 write-in campaign to elect her to Washington's 3rd congressional district, after Republican candidate Tim Moyer suddenly dropped out of the race. In spite of being dubbed the \\"Hazel Dell housewife\\", Smith began a 19-day-long grassroots campaign that resulted in her defeating the only Republican candidate listed on the primary ballot. Having secured a ballot line as the Republican nominee through her September write-in campaign, she went on to defeat liberal three-term Democrat Jolene Unsoeld in November. She narrowly won reelection in 1996, defeating Democrat Brian Baird by only 113 votes. Smith was known for her staunch anti-abortion stance and her maverick tendencies, such as opposing the Balanced Budget Amendment, supporting campaign finance reform, and most notably of all, being one of 9 House Republicans to vote against confirming House Speaker Newt Gingrich in early 1997. She also had a reputation for opposing gay rights and viewed homosexuality as a \\"morally unfit inclination.\\" Giving up her House seat in 1998, Smith ran for Washington's U.S. Senate seat. She defeated former King County Prosecuting Attorney Chris Bayley to face sitting U.S. Senator Patty Murray, only the third Senate race between two women. Many observers expected the election to be close, though Murray won by a 58%-to-42% margin. Shared Hope International In the fall of 1998, while still a member of the U.S. Congress, Linda Smith traveled to Falkland Road in Mumbai (formerly Bombay), India, which is one of the worst brothel districts in the world. The hopeless faces of desperate women and children forced into prostitution compelled her to found Shared Hope International (SHI), a non-profit organization dedicated to eradicating sex-trafficking. Since Smith's retirement from Congress, she has devoted all her energy to this cause, traveling around the world to prevent, restore and bring justice to victims of trafficking. Shared Hope supports shelter and service creation for sex trafficking survivors using a comprehensive model for restoration. By partnering with local organizations, Shared Hope provides restorative care, shelter, education, and job skills training at Homes and Villages of Hope where women and children can live without time limit. Today, Shared Hope provides leadership in awareness and training, prevention strategies, restorative care, research, and policy initiatives to mobilize a national network of protection for victims. =War Against Trafficking Alliance= To build momentum in the international anti- trafficking movement, Smith also founded the War Against Trafficking Alliance (WATA) in January 2001. WATA coordinates both regional and international efforts necessary to combat sex trafficking. In February 2003, WATA co- sponsored a World Summit with the U.S. Department of State, which brought together non-government and government leaders from 114 nations, all demonstrating a sustained commitment to prosecuting trafficking, providing assistance to victims, and building regional strategies to protect the vulnerable from the sex trade. In 2005, WATA was invited to participate, along with UNIFEM, in the first ASEAN conference to address child sex tourism in East and Southeast Asia.http://www.newswit.com/enews/2005-04-20/1410-unifem- invite-you-to-tackling-demand-for-child/ =DEMAND.= With a grant from the U.S. Department of State, Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, Linda Smith and her team have worked in the field conducting research in Jamaica, the Netherlands, Japan, and the United States in order to reveal the sophisticated business model behind sex trafficking, exposing the buyers who increase demand and the traffickers who supply the victims. This extensive research led to SHI's release of the DEMAND. report and documentary in 2007. Demand report DEMAND. documentary =Domestic Minor Sex Trafficking= In response to the findings from the DEMAND. report, since 2006 Smith and Shared Hope International have partnered with Anti-Trafficking Task Forces in ten U.S. cities with funding from the U.S Department of Justice, to identify and provide services to American victims of Domestic Minor Sex Trafficking (DMST). The National Report on Domestic Minor Sex Trafficking: America's Prostituted Children, also released by SHI, compiled all of the information obtained throughout four years of research in America. It examines the governmental and nongovernmental efforts and gaps in addressing child sex trafficking in the United States. =Renting Lacy= After over a decade of undercover investigations, extensive research and conducting thousands of survivor interviews, Smith herself was \\"shocked\\" by what was revealed. In 2009, Smith released a book titled Renting Lacy: A Story of America's Prostituted Children, which explores the traumas endured by young girls who are forced into the commercial sex industry. =Chosen= Smith developed Chosen, a youth sex trafficking prevention film series, after contributing to the rescue of an 18-year-old female who was unknowingly targeted by a trafficker and in immediate danger of being sold. Smith produced Chosen to teach teens the warning signs and indicators of trafficking through the true stories of teenage girls who were tricked by traffickers. Brianna, Lacy and Maria discuss how modern American pimps and gangs are luring youth into the commercial sex industry and how teens can protect themselves and others from being chosen. The resource packages include additional educational tools to further discussion, learning and action. =Demanding Justice Project= The Demanding Justice Project was developed and directed by Smith as a targeted campaign to promote demand deterrence through increased attention and advocacy on demand. The research report documents the outcomes of federal and state arrests, charges and prosecutions of buyers of sex acts with children. The corresponding campaign website, www.demandingjustice.org, contains information about buyers convicted of purchasing sex with a minor. Media/Public Appearances As an expert on trafficking, Linda has spoken out against the trafficking of women and children in numerous Congressional hearings and in national and international forums, such as the World Conference on Trafficking, Congressional Hearing on the International Violence Against Women Act along with Ambassador Melanee Verveer and UNIFEM Goodwill Ambassador Nicole Kidman,https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS126267+20-Oct-2009+PRN20091020 and the U.S.-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission on the Protection of Children. At the Helsinki Commission Hearing in 2006, Smith testified about the Commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) in America. Linda has appeared on CNN, MSNBC, USA Today, Dan Rather Reports, ABC News, the Dr. Phil Show, O'Reilly Factor, and CBN. Linda received the 2009 Soroptimist Making a Difference for Women Awardhttp://tc.yourhub.com/STUART/Stories/Non-profit- Organizations/Special-events/Story~592494.aspx and the 2010 Soroptimist Ruby Award: For Women Helping Women.

Dalits were excluded from the four-fold varna system of Hinduism and were seen as forming a fifth varna, also known by the name of Panchama. Dalits now profess various religious beliefs, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Christianity, Islam and various other belief systems. The term dalits was in use as a translation for the British Raj census classification of Depressed Classes prior to 1935. It was popularised by the economist and reformer B. R. Ambedkar (1891‚Äì1956), who included all depressed people irrespective of their caste into the definition of Dalits. Hence the first group he made was called the \\"Labour Party\\" and included as its members all people of the society who were kept depressed, including women, small scale farmers and people from backward castes. Leftists like Kanhaiya Kumar subscribe to this definition of \\"dalits\\"; thus a Brahmin marginal farmer trying to eke out a living, but unable to do so also falls in the \\"dalit\\" category. Ambedkar himself was a Mahar, and in the 1970s the use of the word \\"dalit\\" was invigorated when it was adopted by the Dalit Panthers activist group. Gradually, political parties used it to gain mileage. India's National Commission for Scheduled Castes considers official use of dalit as a label to be \\"unconstitutional\\" because modern legislation prefers Scheduled Castes; however, some sources say that Dalit has encompassed more communities than the official term of Scheduled Castes and is sometimes used to refer to all of India's oppressed peoples. A similar all-encompassing situation prevails in Nepal. Scheduled Caste communities exist across India, although they are mostly concentrated in four states; they do not share a single language or religion. They comprise 16.6 per cent of India's population, according to the 2011 Census of India. Similar communities are found throughout the rest of South Asia, in Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, and are part of the global Indian diaspora. In 1932, the British Raj recommended separate electorates to select leaders for Dalits in the Communal Award. This was favoured by Ambedkar but when Mahatma Gandhi opposed the proposal it resulted in the Poona Pact. That in turn influenced the Government of India Act, 1935, which introduced the reservation of seats for the Depressed Classes, now renamed as Scheduled Castes. From soon after its independence in 1947, India introduced a reservation system to enhance the ability of Dalits to have political representation and to obtain government jobs and education. In 1997, India elected its first Dalit President, K. R. Narayanan. Many social organisations have promoted better conditions for Dalits through education, healthcare and employment. Nonetheless, while caste- based discrimination was prohibited and untouchability abolished by the Constitution of India, such practices are still widespread. To prevent harassment, assault, discrimination and similar acts against these groups, the Government of India enacted the Prevention of Atrocities Act, also called the SC/ST Act, on 31 March 1995. In accordance with the order of the Bombay High Court, the Information and Broadcasting Ministry (I&B; Ministry) of the Government of India issued an advisory to all media channels in September 2018, asking them to use \\"Scheduled Castes\\" instead of the word \\"Dalit\\". Etymology and usage The word dalit is a vernacular form of the Sanskrit ‡§¶‡§≤‡§ø‡§§ (dalita). In Classical Sanskrit, this means \\"divided, split, broken, scattered\\". This word was repurposed in 19th-century Sanskrit to mean \\"(a person) not belonging to one of the four Brahminic castes\\".\\"Dalit, n.\\" OED Online. Oxford University Press, June 2016. Web. 23 August 2016. It was perhaps first used in this sense by Pune-based social reformer Jyotirao Phule, in the context of the oppression faced by the erstwhile \\"untouchable\\" castes from other Hindus. Dalit is mostly used to describe communities that have been subjected to untouchability. Such people were excluded from the four-fold varna system of Hinduism and thought of themselves as forming a fifth varna, describing themselves as Panchama. The term was in use as a translation for the British Raj census classification of Depressed Classes prior to 1935. It was popularised by the economist and reformer B. R. Ambedkar (1891‚Äì1956), himself a Dalit, and in the 1970s its use was invigorated when it was adopted by the Dalit Panthers activist group. Dalit has become a political identity, similar to how the LGBTQ community reclaimed queer from its pejorative use as a neutral or positive self-identifier and as a political identity. Socio-legal scholar Oliver Mendelsohn and political economist Marika Vicziany wrote in 1998 that the term had become \\"intensely political ... While use of the term might seem to express an appropriate solidarity with the contemporary face of Untouchable politics, there remain major problems in adopting it as a generic term. Although the word is now quite widespread, it still has deep roots in a tradition of political radicalism inspired by the figure of B. R. Ambedkar.\\" They suggested its use risked erroneously labelling the entire population of untouchables in India as being united by a radical politics. Anand Teltumbde also detects a trend towards denial of the politicised identity, for example among educated middle-class people who have converted to Buddhism and argue that, as Buddhists, they cannot be Dalits. This may be due to their improved circumstances giving rise to a desire not to be associated with the what they perceive to be the demeaning Dalit masses. =Other terms= Official term Scheduled Castes is the official term for Dalits in the opinion of India's National Commissions for Scheduled Castes (NCSC), who took legal advice that indicated modern legislation does not refer to Dalit and that therefore, it says, it is \\"unconstitutional\\" for official documents to do so. In 2004, the NCSC noted that some state governments used Dalits rather than Scheduled Castes in documentation and asked them to desist. Some sources say that Dalit encompasses a broader range of communities than the official Scheduled Caste definition. It can include nomadic tribes and another official classification that also originated with the British Raj positive discrimination efforts in 1935, being the Scheduled Tribes. It is also sometimes used to refer to the entirety of India's oppressed peoples, which is the context that applies to its use in Nepalese society. An example of the limitations of the Scheduled Caste category is that, under Indian law, such people can only be followers of Buddhism, Hinduism or Sikhism, yet there are communities who claim to be Dalit Christians and Muslims, and the tribal communities often practise folk religions. Harijan Mahatma Gandhi coined the word Harijan, translated roughly as people of God, to identify untouchables in 1933. The name was disliked by Ambedkar as it emphasised the Dalits as belonging to the Greater Hindu Nation rather than being an independent community like Muslims. In addition, many Dalits saw the term to be patronizing and derogatory. Some have even claimed that the term really refers to children of devadasis, South Indian girls who were married to a temple and served as concubines and prostitutes for upper-caste Hindus, but this claim cannot be verified.. When untouchability was outlawed after Indian independence, the use of the word Harijan to describe the ex-untouchables was more common among other castes than the Dalits themselves. Regional terms In Southern India, Dalits are sometimes known as Adi Dravida, Adi Karnataka, and Adi Andhra, which literally mean First Dravidians, Kannadigas, and Andhras respectively. These terms were first used in 1917 by Southern Dalit leaders, who believed that they were the indigenous inhabitants of India. The terms are used in the states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh/Telangana respectively as a generic term for anyone from a Dalit caste. In Maharashtra, according to historian and women's studies academic Shailaja Paik, Dalit is a term mostly used by members of the Mahar caste, into which Ambedkar was born. Most other communities prefer to use their own caste name. In Nepal, aside from Harijan and, most commonly, Dalit, terms such as Haris (among Muslims), Achhoot, outcastes and neech jati are used. Demographics Punjab had the highest proportion of its population as SC (around 32 per cent), while India's island territories and two northeastern states had approximately zero. Scheduled Caste communities exist across India and comprised 16.6% of the country's population, 2011 Census of India. Uttar Pradesh (21 per cent), West Bengal (11%), Bihar (8%) and Tamil Nadu (7%) between them accounted for almost half the country's total Scheduled Caste population. They were most prevalent as a proportion of the states' population in Punjab, at about 32 per cent, while Mizoram had the lowest at approximately zero. Similar groups are found throughout the rest of the Indian subcontinent, in Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. They are also found as part of the Indian diaspora in many countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Singapore, and the Caribbean. India is home to over 200 million Dalits. According to Paul Diwakar, a Dalit activist from the National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights, \\"India has 600,000 villages and almost every village a small pocket on the outskirts is meant for Dalits.\\" Social status Dalits have had lowest social status in the traditional Hindu social structure but James Lochtefeld, a professor of religion and Asian studies, said in 2002 that the \\"adoption and popularization of [the term Dalit] reflects their growing awareness of the situation, and their greater assertiveness in demanding their legal and constitutional rights\\". = Occupations = In the past, they were believed to be so impure that caste Hindus considered their presence to be polluting. The \\"impure status\\" was related to their historic hereditary occupations that caste Hindus considered to be \\"polluting\\" or debased, such as working with leather, disposal of dead animals, working as \\"manual scavengers\\" or sanitation workers. Forced by the circumstance of their birth and near poverty, Dalits in India continue to work as sanitation workers - as manual scavengers, cleaners of drains, as garbage collectors and sweepers of roads.PRIA (2019): Lived Realities of Women Sanitation Workers in India: Insights from a Participatory Research Conducted in Three Cities of India. Participatory Research in Asia, New Delhi, India It was estimated in 2019 that between 40 to 60 per cent of the 6 million households of Dalit sub-castes are engaged in sanitation work. The most common Dalit caste performing sanitation work is Valmiki (also Balmiki) caste. =History= Gopal Baba Walangkar (ca. 1840‚Äì1900) is generally considered to be the pioneer of the Dalit movement, seeking a society in which they were not discriminated against. Another pioneer was Harichand Thakur (ca. 1812‚Äì1878) with his Matua organisation that involved the Namasudra (Chandala) community in the Bengal Presidency. Ambedkar himself believed Walangkar to be the progenitor. Another early social reformer who worked to improve conditions for Dalits was Jyotirao Phule (1827-1890). The 1950 Constitution of India, introduced after the country gained independence, included measures to improve the socioeconomic conditions of Dalits. Aside from banning untouchability, these included the reservation system, a means of positive discrimination that created the classifications of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes for Dalits. Communities that were categorised as being one of those groups were guaranteed a percentage of the seats in the national and state legislatures, as well as in government jobs and places of education. The system has its origins in the 1932 Poona Pact between Ambedkar and Gandhi, when Ambedkar conceded his demand that the Dalits should have an electorate separate from the caste Hindus in return for Gandhi accepting measures along these lines. The notion of a separate electorate had been proposed in the Communal Award made by the British Raj authorities, and the outcome of the Pact - the Government of India Act of 1935 - both introduced the new term of Scheduled Castes in replacement for Depressed Classes and reserved seats for them in the legislatures. By 1995, of all federal government jobs in India - 10.1 per cent of Class I, 12.7 per cent of Class II, 16.2 per cent of Class III, and 27.2 per cent of Class IV jobs were held by Dalits. Of the most senior jobs in government agencies and government- controlled enterprises, only 1 per cent were held by Dalits, not much change in 40 years. In the 21st century, Dalits have been elected to India's highest judicial and political offices. In 2001, the quality of life of the Dalit population in India was worse than that of the overall Indian population on metrics such as access to health care, life expectancy, education attainability, access to drinking water and housing. In 2010, Dalits received international attention due to a portrait exhibition by Marcus Perkins that depicted Dalits. According to a 2007 report by Human Rights Watch (HRW), the treatment of Dalits has been like a \\"hidden apartheid\\" and that they \\"endure segregation in housing, schools, and access to public services\\". HRW noted that Manmohan Singh, then Prime Minister of India, saw a parallel between the apartheid system and untouchability. Eleanor Zelliot also notes Singh's 2006 comment but says that, despite the obvious similarities, race prejudice and the situation of Dalits \\"have a different basis and perhaps a different solution.\\" Though the Indian Constitution abolished untouchability, the oppressed status of Dalits remains a reality. In rural India, stated Klaus Klostermaier in 2010, \\"they still live in secluded quarters, do the dirtiest work, and are not allowed to use the village well and other common facilities\\". In the same year, Zelliot noted that \\"In spite of much progress over the last sixty years, Dalits are still at the social and economic bottom of society.\\" Economic status According to a 2014 report to the Ministry of Minority Affairs, over 44.8 per cent of Scheduled Tribe (ST) and 33.8 per cent of Scheduled Caste (SC) populations in rural India were living below the poverty line in 2011‚Äì12. In urban areas, 27.3 per cent of ST and 21.8 per cent of SC populations were below the poverty line. Some Dalits have achieved affluence, although most remain poor. Some Dalit intellectuals, such as Chandra Bhan Prasad, have argued that the living standards of many Dalits have improved since the economic system became more liberalized starting in 1991 and have supported their claims through large surveys. According to the Socio Economic and Caste Census 2011, nearly 79 per cent of Adivasi households and 73 per cent of Dalit households were the most deprived among rural households in India. While 45 per cent of SC households are landless and earn a living by manual casual labour, the figure is 30 per cent for Adivasis. A 2012 survey by Mangalore University in Karnataka found that 93 per cent of Dalit families in the state of Karnataka live below the poverty line. Discrimination =Education= According to an analysis by The IndiaGoverns Research Institute, Dalits constituted nearly half of primary school dropouts in Karnataka during the period 2012‚Äì14. A sample survey in 2014, conducted by Dalit Adhikar Abhiyan and funded by ActionAid, found that among state schools in Madhya Pradesh, 88 percent discriminated against Dalit children. In 79 percent of the schools studied, Dalit children are forbidden from touching mid-day meals. They are required to sit separately at lunch in 35 percent of schools, and are required to eat with specially marked plates in 28 percent. There have been incidents and allegations of SC and ST teachers and professors being discriminated against and harassed by authorities, upper castes colleagues and upper caste students in different education institutes of India. In some cases, such as in Gujarat, state governments have argued that, far from being discriminatory, their rejection when applying for jobs in education has been because there are no suitably qualified candidates from those classifications. =Healthcare and nutrition= Discrimination can also exist in access to healthcare and nutrition. A sample survey of Dalits, conducted over several months in Madhya Pradesh and funded by ActionAid in 2014, found that health field workers did not visit 65 per cent of Dalit settlements. 47 per cent of Dalits were not allowed entry into ration shops; and 64 per cent were given less grains than non-Dalits. In Haryana state, 49 per cent of Dalit children under five years were underweight and malnourished while 80 per cent of those in the 6‚Äì59 months age group were anaemic in 2015. =Crime= Dalits comprise a slightly disproportionate number of India's prison inmates. While Dalits (including both SCs and STs) constitute 25 per cent of the Indian population, they account for 33.2 per cent of prisoners. About 24.5 per cent of death row inmates in India are from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes which is proportionate to their population. The percentage is highest in Maharashtra (50 per cent), Karnataka (36.4 per cent) and Madhya Pradesh (36 per cent). Caste-related violence between Dalit and non-Dalits allegedly stems from Dalit's economic success amidst ongoing prejudice. The Bhagana rape case, which arose out of a dispute of allocation of land, is an example of atrocities against Dalit girls and women. In August 2015, due to continued alleged discrimination from upper castes of the village, about 100 Dalit inhabitants converted to Islam in a ceremony at Jantar Mantar, New Delhi. Inter-caste marriage has been proposed as a remedy, but according to a 2014 survey of 42,000 households by the New Delhi-based National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) and the University of Maryland, it was estimated that only 5 per cent of Indian marriages cross caste boundaries. A 2006 article reported incidents of violence, disputes and discrimination against Dalits in Maharashtra. The article noted that non-Dalit families claimed they do not treat Dalits differently. A carpenter caste person said, \\"We tell them anything and they tell us you are pointing fingers at us because of our caste; we all live together, and there are bound to be fights, but they think we target them.\\" There have been reports of Dalits being forced to eat human faeces and drink urine by Christian Thevars, an OBC. In September 2015, a 45-year-old dalit woman was allegedly stripped naked and was forced to drink urine by perpetrators in Madhya Pradesh. =Prevention of Atrocities Act= The Government of India has attempted on several occasions to legislate specifically to address the issue of caste-related violence that affects SCs and STs. Aside from the Constitutional abolition of untouchability, there has been the Untouchability (Offences) Act of 1955, which was amended in the same year to become the Protection of Civil Rights Act. It was determined that neither of those Acts were effective, so the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act of 1989 (POA) came into force. The POA designated specific crimes against SCs and STs as \\"atrocities\\" ‚Äì a criminal act that has \\"the quality of being shockingly cruel and inhumane\\" ‚Äì which should be prosecuted under its terms rather than existing criminal law. It created corresponding punishments. Its purpose was to curb and punish violence against Dalits, including humiliations such as the forced consumption of noxious substances. Other atrocities included forced labour, denial of access to water and other public amenities, and sexual abuse. The Act permitted Special Courts exclusively to try POA cases. The Act called on states with high levels of caste violence (said to be \\"atrocity- prone\\") to appoint qualified officers to monitor and maintain law and order. In 2015, the Parliament of India passed the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act to address issues regarding implementation of the POA, including instances where the police put procedural obstacles in the way of alleged victims or indeed outright colluded with the accused. It also extended the number of acts that were deemed to be atrocities. One of those remedies, in an attempt to address the slow process of cases, was to make it mandatory for states to set up the exclusive Special Courts that the POA had delineated. Progress in doing so, however, was reported in April 2017 to be unimpressive. P. L. Punia, a former chairman of the NCSC, said that the number of pending cases was high because most of the extant Special Courts were in fact not exclusive but rather being used to process some non-POA cases, and because \\"The special prosecutors are not bothered and the cases filed under this Act are as neglected as the victims\\". While Dalit rights organisations were cautiously optimistic that the amended Act would improve the situation, legal experts were pessimistic. =Segregation= Fa Xian, a Chinese Buddhist pilgrim who recorded his visit to India in the early 5th century, mentioned segregation in the context of the untouchable Chandala community: While discrimination against Dalits has declined in urban areas and in the public sphere, it still exists in rural areas and in the private sphere, in everyday matters such as access to eating places, schools, temples and water sources. Some Dalits successfully integrated into urban Indian society, where caste origins are less obvious. In rural India, however, caste origins are more readily apparent and Dalits often remain excluded from local religious life, though some qualitative evidence suggests that exclusion is diminishing. According to the 2014 NCAER/University of Maryland survey, 27 per cent of the Indian population still practices untouchability. The figure may be higher because many people refuse to acknowledge doing so when questioned, although the methodology of the survey was also criticised for potentially inflating the figure. Across India, Untouchability was practised among 52 per cent of Brahmins, 33 per cent of Other Backward Classes and 24 per cent of non-Brahmin forward castes. Untouchability was also practiced by people of minority religions ‚Äì 23 per cent of Sikhs, 18 per cent of Muslims and 5 per cent of Christians. According to statewide data, Untouchability is most commonly practiced in Madhya Pradesh (53 per cent), followed by Himachal Pradesh (50 per cent), Chhattisgarh (48 per cent), Rajasthan and Bihar (47 per cent), Uttar Pradesh (43 per cent), and Uttarakhand (40 per cent). Examples of segregation have included the Madhya Pradesh village of Ghatwani, where the Scheduled Tribe population of Bhilala do not allow Dalit villagers to use public borewell for fetching water and thus they are forced to drink dirty water. In metropolitan areas around New Delhi and Bangalore, Dalits and Muslims face discrimination from upper caste landlords when seeking places to rent. =Social persecution by caste Hindus= A Dalit found burning holika for Holika Dahan ceremony, was tonsured and paraded naked in the villages. In some parts of India, there have been allegations that Dalit grooms riding horses for wedding ceremonies have been beaten up and ostracised by upper caste people. In August 2015, upper caste people burned houses and vehicles belonging to Dalit families and slaughtered their livestock in reaction to Dalits daring to hold a temple car procession at a village in Tamil Nadu. In August 2015, it was claimed that a Jat Khap Panchayat ordered the rape of two Dalit sisters because their brother eloped with a married Jat girl of the same village. Religion Most Dalits in India practice Hinduism. But Buddhism is the fastest growing religion among Dalits. According to the 2011 census data, the numbers of Scheduled Caste Buddhists have increased by 38% from 41.59 lakh in 2001 to 57.56 lakh in 2011, while the total SC population grew by 21.3% from 16.6 crore to 20.14 crore. According to the 61st round Survey of the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, 90 percent of Buddhists, one-third of Sikhs, and one-third of Christians in India belonged to Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes. =Hinduism= History The timing of the appearance of Dalits in India cannot be easily determined. According to Ambedkar, Dalits did not exist in the Vedic period or the period of the Dharma Sutras. Ambedkar said that untouchability came into Indian society around 400 AD, due to the struggle for supremacy between Buddhism and Brahmanism (an ancient term for Brahmanical Hinduism). Some Hindu priests befriended Dalits and were demoted to low-caste ranks. Eknath, another excommunicated Brahmin, fought for the rights of untouchables during the Bhakti period. Historical examples of Dalit priests include Chokhamela in the 14th century, who was India's first recorded Dalit poet. Raidas (Ravidass), born into a family of cobblers, is considered a guru by Dalits and is held in high regard. His teachings and writings form part of the Sikh holy book, the Guru Granth Sahib. The 15th-century saint Ramananda Ray accepted all castes, including Untouchables, into his fold. Most of these saints subscribed to the medieval era Bhakti movement in Hinduism that rejected casteism. The story of Nandanar describes a low-caste Hindu devotee who was rejected by the priests but accepted by God. Reform movements A school of untouchables near Bangalore, by Lady Ottoline Morrell. In the 19th century, the Brahmo Samaj, Arya Samaj and the Ramakrishna Mission actively participated in Dalit emancipation. While Dalits had places to worship, the first upper-caste temple to openly welcome Dalits was the Laxminarayan Temple in Wardha in 1928. It was followed by the Temple Entry Proclamation issued by the last King of Travancore in the Indian state of Kerala in 1936. The Punjabi reformist Satnami movement was founded by Dalit Guru Ghasidas. Guru Ravidas was also a Dalit. Giani Ditt Singh, a Dalit Sikh reformer, started Singh Sabha movement to convert Dalits. Other reformers, such as Jyotirao Phule, Ayyankali of Kerala and Iyothee Thass of Tamil Nadu worked for Dalit emancipation. In the 1930s, Gandhi and Ambedkar disagreed regarding retention of the caste system. Whilst Ambedkar wanted to see it destroyed, Gandhi thought that it could be modified by reinterpreting Hindu texts so that the untouchables were absorbed into the Shudra varna. This was this disagreement that led to the Poona Pact. Despite the disagreement, Gandhi began the Harijan Yatra to help the Dalits. The declaration by princely states of Kerala between 1936 and 1947 that temples were open to all Hindus went a long way towards ending Untouchability there. However, educational opportunities to Dalits in Kerala remain limited. Other Hindu groups attempted to reconcile with the Dalit community. Hindu temples are increasingly receptive to Dalit priests, a function formerly reserved for Brahmins. The fight for temple entry rights for Dalits continues to cause controversy. Brahmins such as Subramania Bharati passed Brahminhood onto a Dalit, while in Shivaji's Maratha Empire Dalit warriors (the Mahar Regiment) joined his forces. In a 2015 incident in Meerut, when a Dalit belonging to Valmiki caste was denied entry to a Hindu temple he converted to Islam. In September 2015, four Dalit women were fined by the upper-caste Hindus for entering a temple in Karnataka. There have been allegations that Dalits in Nepal are denied entry to Hindu temples. In at least one reported case were beaten up by some upper caste people for doing so. =Buddhism= In Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and a few other regions, Dalits came under the influence of the neo-Buddhist movement initiated by Ambedkar. In the 1950s, he turned his attention to Buddhism and travelled to Ceylon (Sri Lanka) to attend a convention of Buddhist scholars and monks. While dedicating a new Buddhist vihara near Pune, he announced that he was writing a book on Buddhism, and that he planned a formal conversion. Ambedkar twice visited Burma in 1954; the second time to attend a conference of the World Fellowship of Buddhists in Rangoon. In 1955, he founded the Bharatiya Bauddha Mahasabha (Buddhist Society of India). He completed writing The Buddha and His Dhamma in May 1956. After meetings with the Buddhist monk Hammalawa Saddhatissa, Ambedkar organised a public ceremony for himself and his supporters in Nagpur on 14 October 1956. Accepting the Three Refuges and Five Precepts in the traditional manner, he completed his conversion. He then proceeded to convert an estimated 500,000 of his supporters. Taking the 22 Vows, they explicitly condemned and rejected Hinduism and Hindu philosophy. In the 1951 census of India, 181,000 (0.05%) respondents said they were Buddhist.Kantowsky, Detlef (1997). Buddhisten in Indien heute, Indica et Tibetica 30, 111 The 1961 census, taken after B. R. Ambedkar adopted Navayana Buddhism with his millions of followers in 1956, showed an increased to 3.25 million (0.74%). Buddhism is growing rapidly in the Scheduled Caste (dalit) community. According to the 2011 census, Scheduled Castes Buddhists grew by 38 percent in the country. According to the 2011 census, 8.4 million Buddhists in India, and 5.76 million (69%) Indian Buddhists belong to the Scheduled Caste. Buddhism is the fastest growing religion among Scheduled Castes (dalits). However, Buddhists still form only 2.83% of the overall Dalit population. According to the 2011 census data, the numbers of Scheduled Caste Buddhists have increased by 38% from 41.59 lakh in 2001 to 57.56 lakh in 2011, while the total SC population grew by 21.3% from 16.6 crore to 20.14 crore. =Sikhism= Guru Nanak in Guru Granth Sahib calls for everyone to treat each other equally. Subsequent Sikh Gurus, all of whom came from the Khatri caste, also denounced the hierarchy of the caste system. Despite this, social stratification exists in the Sikh community. The bulk of the Sikhs of Punjab belong to the Jat caste; there are also two Dalit Sikh castes in the state, called the Mazhabis and the Ramdasias. Sunrinder S. Jodhka says that, in practice, Sikhs belonging to the landowning dominant castes have not shed all their prejudices against the dalit castes. While dalits would be allowed entry into the village gurudwaras they would not be permitted to cook or serve langar (the communal meal). Therefore, wherever they could mobilise resources, the Sikh dalits of Punjab have tried to construct their own gurudwara and other local-level institutions in order to attain a certain degree of cultural autonomy. In 1953, Sikh leader, Master Tara Singh, succeeded in winning the demands from the Government to include Sikh castes of the converted untouchables in the list of scheduled castes. In the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC), 20 of the 140 seats are reserved for low-caste Sikhs. Sikh women are required to have the surname \\"Kaur,\\" and men, the surname \\"Singh,\\" in order to eradicate caste identities and discrimination. Talhan Gurdwara conflict In 2003 the Talhan village Gurudwara endured a bitter dispute between Jat Sikhs and Chamars. The Chamars came out in force and confronted the Randhawa and Bains Jat Sikh landlords, who refused to give the Chamars a share on the governing committee of a shrine dedicated to Shaheed Baba Nihal Singh. The shrine earned 3‚Äì7 crore Indian Rupees, and the Jat Sikh landlords allegedly \\"gobbled up a substantial portion of the offerings\\". Though Dalits form more than 60 per cent of Talhan's 5,000-strong population, local traditions ensured that they were denied a place on the committee. The landlords, in league with radical Sikh organisations and the SGPC, attempted to keep out the Dalits by razing the shrine overnight and constructing a gurdwara on it, but the Dalit quest for a say in the governing committee did not end. Chamars fought a four-year court battle with the landlords and their allies, including the Punjab Police. In that time Dalits conducted several boycotts against the Chamars. The Jat Sikhs and their allies cut off the power supply to their homes. In addition, various scuffles and fights set Chamar youths armed with lathis, rocks, bricks, soda bottles and anything they could find fought Jat Sikh landlords, youths and the Punjab police. Dalit youngsters painted their homes and motorcycles with the slogan, Putt Chamar De (proud sons of Chamars) in retaliation to the Jat slogan, Putt Jattan De. =Jainism= Historically Jainism was practiced by many communities across India. They are often conservative and are generally considered upper-caste. In 1958,Nathuram Chandalia, Mewad men Veerwal Pravriti, pp. 220‚Äì21 a Sthanakvasi Jain called Muni Sameer Muni‡§µ‡•Ä‡§∞‡§µ‡§æ‡§≤ ‡§ú‡•à‡§® ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§æ‡§ú ‡§ï‡•á ‡§ó‡•Å‡§∞‡•Å ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§™‡•Å‡§£‡•ç‡§Ø‡§§‡§ø‡§•‡§ø ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ö ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç, Bhaskar News Network31 December 2013 came into contact with members of the Khatik community in the Udaipur region, who decided to adopt Jainism. Their centre, Ahimsa Nagar, located about four miles from Chittorgarh, was inaugurated by Mohanlal Sukhadia in 1966. Sameer Muni termed them Veerwaal, i.e. belonging to Mahavira. A 22-year-old youth, Chandaram Meghwal, was initiated as a Jain monk at Ahore town in Jalore district in 2005. In 2010 a Mahar engineer called Vishal Damodar was initiated as a Jain monk by Acharya Navaratna Sagar Suriji at Samet Shikhar. Acharya Nanesh, the eighth Achayra of Sadhumargi Jain Shravak Sangha had preached among the Balai community in 1963 near Ratlam.'‡§¶‡§ø‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§Æ‡§π‡§æ‡§™‡•Å‡§∞‡•Å‡§∑ ‡§•‡•á ‡§Ü‡§ö‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§®‡§æ‡§®‡•á‡§∂' Vinay N.

Mass conversions of lower caste Hindus to Christianity and Islam took place in order to escape the discrimination. The main Dalit groups that participated in these conversions were the Chuhras of Punjab, Chamars of North India (Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh), Vankars of Gujarat, and Pulayas of Kerala. The first people converted to Christianity by Jesuits of the Madura Mission were members of Nadars, Maravars, and Pallar. They believed that ‚ÄúChristianity is a true religion; a desire for protection from oppressors and, if possible, material aid; the desire for education for their children; and the knowledge that those who have become Christians had improved‚Äù. Christianity was thought to be egalitarian and could provide mobility away from the caste. Sometimes the only change seen was their personal religious identity. Even after conversion, in some cases Dalits were discriminated against due to the ‚Äúresidual leftover‚Äù practice of caste discrimination from their previous traditions. This is attributed to the predominantly Hindu society they lived in. Discrimination against Dalit Christians also remained in interactions and mannerisms between castes; for example, during the earlier days, the ‚Äòlower caste Christians‚Äô had to [cover] their mouths when talking to a Syrian Christian. In many cases they were still referred to by their Hindu caste names: For example Pulayans in Kerala, Pariah in Tamil Nadu, and Madigas in Andra Pradesh, by members of all religious backgrounds. Even after conversion, to some extent segregation, restriction, hierarchy, and graded ritual purity remained. Data shows that there is more discrimination and less class mobility among the people living in the rural areas, where incidents of caste discrimination is higher among people from all religious backgrounds. In many cases, the churches referred to the Dalits as ‚ÄòNew Christians‚Äô. It is alleged to be a derogatory term which classifies the Dalit Christians to be looked down upon by other Christians. During the earlier days of Christianity, in some churches in south India the Dalits had either separate seating, or had to attend the mass outside. Dalit Christians are also said to be grossly underrepresented amongst the clergy in some places. Inter-caste marriage among Christians is also not commonly practiced. For example, Syrian Christians in Kerala marry Dalit Christians Even intermarriage between Bamons and Sudras in Goa is quite uncommon. Sometimes marriage to a higher class Hindu is preferred to marriage to a Dalit Christian. Caste-based occupations held by Dalits also show a clear segregation which perpetuated even after becoming christian. Occupational patterns (including manual scavenging) are prevalent among Dalit Christians in north-west India are said to be quite similar to that of Dalit Hindus. Occupational discrimination for Dalit Christians goes so far as to restrict not only employment but in some cases for clean sanitation and water.Jose, Kananaikil. 1990. Scheduled Castes Converts and Social Disabilities: A survey of Tamil Nadu =Islam= Dalit Muslim refers to Hindu Untouchables, also called Dalits, who have converted to Islam. Political involvement Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) is an Indian Dalit party. Dalit political parties include: * Bahujan Samaj Party * Republican Party of India factions, active in Maharashtra * Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi and Puthiya Tamilagam are the two major dalit parties in Tamil Nadu * Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh, led by Prakash Yashwant Ambedkar, Ambedkar's grandson * Lok Janshakti Party, Bihar * Bahujan Shakti Party, Nepal * Dalit Janajati Party, Nepal Anti-Dalit prejudices exist in groups such as the extremist militia Ranvir Sena, largely run by upper- caste landlords in Bihar. They oppose equal treatment of Dalits and have resorted to violence. The Ranvir Sena is considered a terrorist organisation by the government of India. In 2015, Cobrapost exposed many leaders especially like C. P. Thakur alongside former PM Chandra Shekhar associated with Ranvir Sena in Bihar Dalit massacres while governments of Nitish Kumar (under pressure from BJP), Lalu Prasad Yadav and Rabri Devi did nothing to get justice for Dalits. The rise of Hindutva's (Hindu nationalism) role in Indian politics has accompanied allegations that religious conversions of Dalits are due to allurements like education and jobs rather than faith. Critics argue that laws banning conversion and limiting social relief for converts mean that conversion impedes economic success. However, Bangaru Laxman, a Dalit politician, was a prominent member of the Hindutva movement. Another political issue is Dalit affirmative-action quotas in government jobs and university admissions. About 8 per cent of the seats in the National and State Parliaments are reserved for Scheduled Caste and Tribe candidates. Jagjivan Ram(1908‚Äì1986) was the first scheduled caste leader to emerge at the national level from Bihar.Verma, R.K., 1991. Caste and Bihar Politics. Economic and Political Weekly, pp.1142‚Äì1144. He was member of the Constituent assembly that drafted India's constitution. Ram also served in the interim national government of 1946 He served in the cabinets of Congress party Prime ministers Jawaharlal Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri and Indira Gandhi. His last position in government was as Deputy Prime Minister of India in the Janata Party government of 1977‚Äì1979, In modern times several Bharatiya Janata Party leaders were Dalits, including Dinanath Bhaskar, Ramchandra Veerappa and Dr. Suraj Bhan. In India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, Dalits have had a major political impact. The Dalit-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) had previously run the government and that party's leader, Mayawati, served several times as chief minister. Regarding her election in 2007, some reports claimed her victory was due to her ability to win support from both 17 per cent of Muslims and nearly 17 per cent Brahmins alongside 80 per cent of Dalits. However, surveys of voters on the eve of elections, indicated that caste loyalties were not the voters' principal concern. Instead, inflation and other issues of social and economic development dictated the outcome. Mayawati's success in reaching across castes has led to speculation about her as a potential future Prime Minister of India. Aside from Mayawati in Uttar Pradesh, Damodaram Sanjivayya was chief minister of Andhra Pradesh (from 11 January 1960 ‚Äì 12 March 1962) and Jitan Ram Manjhi was chief minister of Bihar for just less than a year. In 1997, K. R. Narayanan, who was a Dalit, was elected as President of India. =Vote bank= Votebank politics are common in India, usually based on religion or caste. Indeed, the term itself was coined by the Indian sociologist, M. N. Srinivas. Dalits are often used as a votebank. There have been instances where it has been alleged that an election-winning party reneged on promises made to the Dalits made during the election campaign or have excluded them from party affairs. =Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Sub-Plan= The SC, ST Sub-Plan, or Indiramma Kalalu, is a budget allocation by the Government of Andhra Pradesh for the welfare of Dalits. The law was enacted in May 2013. SCs and STs have separate panels for spending. The plan was meant to prevent the government from diverting funds meant for SCs and STs to other programs, which was historically the case. , no equivalent national plan existed. Scheduled Castes Sub Plan and Tribal Sub- Plan funds are often diverted by state governments to other purposes. While the Indian Constitution has provisions for the social and economic uplift of Dalits to support their upward social mobility, these concessions are limited to Hindus. Dalits who have converted to other religions have asked that benefits be extended to them. Beyond the Indian subcontinent =United Kingdom= After World War II, immigration from the former British Empire was largely driven by labour shortages. Like the rest of the Indian subcontinent diaspora, Dalits immigrated and established their own communities. A 2009 report alleged that caste discrimination is \\"rife\\" in the United Kingdom. The report alleged that casteism persists in the workplace and within the National Health Service and at doctor's offices. Some claim that caste discrimination is non-existent. Some have rejected the government's right to interfere in the community. The Hindu Forum of Britain conducted their own research, concluding that caste discrimination was \\"not endemic in British society\\", that reports to the contrary aimed to increase discrimination by legislating expression and behaviour and that barriers should instead be removed through education. A 2010 study found that caste discrimination occurs in Britain at work and in service provision. While not ruling out the possibility of discrimination in education, no such incidents were uncovered. The report found favourable results from educational activities. However, non-legislative approaches were claimed to be less effective in the workplace and would not help when the authorities were discriminating. One criticism of discrimination law was the difficulty in obtaining proof of violations. Perceived benefits of legislation were that it provides redress, leads to greater understanding and reduces the social acceptance of such discrimination. More recent studies in Britain were inconclusive and found that discrimination was \\"not religion specific and is subscribed to by members of any or no religion\\". Equalities Minister Helen Grant found insufficient evidence to justify specific legislation, while Shadow Equalities minister Kate Green said that the impact is on a relatively small number of people. Religious studies professor Gavin Flood of the Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies concluded that the Hindu community in Britain is particularly well integrated, loosening caste ties. Casteist beliefs were prevalent mainly among first generation immigrants, with such prejudices declining with each successive generation due to greater assimilation. From September 2013 to February 2014, Indian philosopher Meena Dhanda led a project on 'Caste in Britain' for the UK Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), which focused on the proposed inclusion of a provision in the Equality Act 2010 to protect British citizens against caste discrimination. Supporters of anti-caste legislation include Lord Avebury and Lady Thornton. Romani diaspora in Europe The Romani people, originating in northern India, are said to be of Dalit ancestry. Between 1001 to 1026, the Romani fought under their Hindu rulers to fight the Ghaznavids. Sikh diaspora in Britain Britain are Caste based and one can indirectly inquire about a person's caste based upon which gurdwara he attends. Sikhs in the United Kingdom are affected by caste. Gurdwaras such as those of the Ramgarhia Sikhs are organised along caste lines and most are controlled by a single caste. In most British towns and cities with a significant Sikh population, rival gurdwaras can be found with caste-specific management committees. The caste system and caste identity is entrenched and reinforced. Mazhabi Sikhs and Hindu Churas have united to establish their own temples throughout Britain. Some Valmiki temples keep a copy of the Guru Granth Sahib and Mazhabi Sikhs and Valmikis prayer together. Dalit Sikhs have formed a network of lower caste temples throughout the UK. Caste tensions erupt between higher caste Jat Sikhs and lower caste Sikhs. Violence has erupted between the two communities over inter-caste marriages. In the city of Wolverhampton, there have been incidents of Jat Sikhs refusing to share water taps and avoiding physical contact with lower castes. At a sports competition in Birmingham in 1999, Jat Sikhs refused to eat food that had been cooked and prepared by the Chamar community.Human rights watch (2001) Caste discrimination: A global concern. Human Rights Commission. p. 22 Many Jat Sikhs refer to lower-caste temples by name such as the Ramgharia Gurdwara, Ghumaran Da Gurdwaraor Chamar Gurdwara. The majority of higher caste Sikhs would not eat in a Ravidassi house or in Ravidassi temples. Many Chamars stated that they are made to feel unwelcome in Sikh gurdwaras and Hindu temples. Many Sikhs do not wish to give Chamars equal status in their gurdwaras and communities. Sikh Chamars (Ramdassi Sikhs) united with fellow Chamars across religious boundaries to form Ravidassi temples. Mazhabi Sikhs were subjected to the same forms of inequality and discrimination in gurdwaras from Upper caste Sikhs and unified with Hindu Churas to form Valmiki temples. Sikh gurdwaras, which often are controlled by the older first generation immigrants, in Britain generally frown upon inter- caste marriages even though they are on the rise. More and more families are affected by inter-caste marriages. The few gurdwaras that accept inter-caste marriages do so reluctantly. Gurdwaras may insist on the presence of Singh and Kaur in the names of the bridegroom and bride, or deny them access to gurdwara-based religious services and community centres. =Dalits in the Caribbean= It is estimated that in 1883, about one-third of the immigrants who arrived in the Caribbean were Dalits. The shared experience of being exploited in a foreign land gradually broke down caste barriers in the Caribbean Hindu communities. =Dalits in the United States= Many Dalits first came to the United States to flee caste-based oppression in South Asia. After the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the demand for laborers brought in many caste-diverse South Asian immigrants, many of whom were Dalit. After the 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act, immigrants from India were primarily professionals and students, largely from upper caste or dominant caste families. However, from the 1990s onwards, many more of the skilled laborers arriving from India have been Dalit, due to multiple generations of affirmative action policies in India, as well as ongoing efforts of organized resistance against caste discrimination.Zwick-Maitreyi, M., Soundararajan, T., Dar, N., Bheel, R.F., and Balakrishnan, P.

Literature Dalit literature forms a distinct part of Indian literature. One of the first Dalit writers was Madara Chennaiah, an 11th-century cobbler-saint who lived in the reign of Western Chalukyas and who is regarded by some scholars as the \\"father of Vachana poetry\\". Another early Dalit poet is Dohara Kakkaiah, a Dalit by birth, six of whose confessional poems survive. The Bharatiya Dalit Sahitya Akademi (Indian Dalit Literature Academy) was founded in 1984 by Babu Jagjivan Ram. Notable modern authors include Mahatma Phule and Ambedkar in Maharashtra, who focused on the issues of Dalits through their works and writings. This started a new trend in Dalit writing and inspired many Dalits to offer work in Marathi, Hindi, Tamil and Punjabi.Dalit's passage to consciousness The Tribune, 28 September 2003 There are novels, poems and even drama on Dalit issues. The Indian author Rajesh Talwar has written a play titled 'Gandhi, Ambedkar, and the Four Legged Scorpion' in which the personal experiences of Dr Ambedkar and the sufferings of the community have been highlighted. Baburao Bagul, Bandhu MadhavDalit literature is not down and out any more Times of India, 7 July 1989 and Shankar Rao Kharat, worked in the 1960s. Later the Little magazine movement became popular.A Critical study of Dalit Literature in India Dr. Jugal Kishore Mishra In Sri Lanka, writers such as K.Daniel and Dominic Jeeva gained mainstream popularity. Dalits in the film industry Until the 1980s, Dalits had little involvement in Bollywood or other film industries of India and the community were rarely depicted at the heart of storylines. Chirag Paswan (son of Dalit leader Ram Vilas Paswan) launched his career in Bollywood with his debut film Miley Naa Miley Hum in 2011. Despite political connections and the financial ability to struggle against ingrained prejudices, Chirag was not able to \\"bag\\" any other movie project in the following years. Chirag, in his early days, described Bollywood as his \\"childhood dream\\", but eventually entered politics instead. When the media tried to talk to him about \\"Caste in Bollywood\\", he refused to talk about the matter, and his silence speaks for itself. A recent Hindi film to portray a Dalit character in the leading role, although it was not acted by a Dalit, was Eklavya: The Royal Guard (2007). The continued use of caste based references to Dalit sub-castes in South Indian films (typecast and pigeonholed in their main socio-economic sub-group) angers many Dalit fans. Internal conflicts Several Dalit groups are rivals and sometimes communal tensions are evident. A study found more than 900 Dalit sub-castes throughout India, with internal divisions.p. 54 Dalits and Human Rights: Dalits: security and rights implications By Prem K Shinde Emphasising any one caste threatens what is claimed to be an emerging Dalit identity and fostering rivalry among SCs. A DLM (Dalit Liberation Movement) party leader said in the early 2000s that it is easier to organise Dalits on a caste basis than to fight caste prejudice itself. Balmikis and Pasis in the 1990s refused to support the BSP, claiming it was a Jatav party but over 80 per cent of dalits from all united Dalit castes voted BSP to power in 2007. Many converted Dalit Sikhs claim a superior status over the Hindu Raigars, Joatia Chamars and Ravidasis and sometimes refuse to intermarry with them. They are divided into gotras that regulate their marriage alliances. In Andhra Pradesh, Mala and Madiga were constantly in conflict with each other but as of 2015 Mala and Madiga students work for common dalit cause at University level. Although the Khateek (butchers) are generally viewed as a higher caste than Bhangis, the latter refuse to offer cleaning services to Khateeks, believing that their profession renders them unclean. They also consider the Balai, Dholi and Mogya as unclean and do not associate with them.

About 0.7 km¬≤ in size, it is situated about 3 km from the shoreline. At the western end of the island a hard, grey, limestone cliff rises 80 m above the lake's level (1,912 m above sea level). The island declines to the east to a level site where a spring provides ample water. It is home to the 10th century Armenian Holy Cross Cathedral, which was the seat of the Armenian Apostolic Catholicosate of Aghtamar from 1116 to 1895.

The origin and meaning of the island's name is unknown,Sirarpe Der Nersessian, \\"Aght'amar, Church of the Holy Cross\\", page 1. but a folk etymology explanation exists, based on an old Armenian legend. According to the tale, an Armenian princess named Tamara lived on the island and was in love with a commoner. This boy would swim from the shore to the island each night, guided by a light she lit for him. Her father learned of the boy's visits. One night, as she waited for her lover to arrive, her father smashed her light, leaving the boy in the middle of the lake without a guide to indicate which direction to swim. He drowned and his body washed ashore and, as the legend concludes, it appeared as if the words \\"Akh, Tamara\\" (Oh, Tamara) were frozen on his lips. Dzotsikian, S.

He founded a settlement and erected a large square palace richly decorated with frescoes, built a dock noted for its complex hydrotechnical engineering, laid out streets, gardens, and orchards, and planted trees and designed areas of recreation for himself and his court.

The only surviving structure from that period is the Palatine Cathedral of the Holy Cross ( Surb Khach yekeƒ°etsi). It was built of pink volcanic tuff by the architect-monk Manuel during the years 915-921, with an interior measuring 14.80m √ó 11.5m and the dome reaching 20.40m above ground. In later centuries, and until 1915, it formed part of a monastic complex, the ruins of which can still be seen to the south of the church. Between 1116 and 1895 the island was the location of the Catholicosate of Aghtamar of the Armenian Apostolic Church. Khachatur III, who died in 1895, was the last Catholicos of Aght'amar. In April 1915, during the Armenian Genocide, the monks on Aght'amar were massacred, the cathedral looted, and the monastic buildings destroyed. On August 28, 2010, a small solar energy power plant was opened on the island, to provide local installations with electricity.  Holy Cross Cathedral  The Armenian Cathedral of the Holy Cross The cathedral. A detail of David and Goliath from the cathedral The architecture of the church is based on a form that had been developed in Armenia several centuries earlier; the best-known example being that of the seventh century St. Hripsime church in Echmiadzin, incorporating a dome with a conical roof. The unique importance of the Cathedral Church of the Holy Cross comes from the extensive array of bas-relief carving of mostly biblical scenes that adorn its external walls. The meanings of these reliefs have been the subject of much and varied interpretation. Not all of this speculation has been produced in good faith - for example, Turkish sources illustrate Islamic and Turkic influences behind the content of some of the reliefs, such as the prominent depiction of a prince sitting cross-legged on a Turkic-style, low throne. Some scholarsSee additionally A. D. H. Bivar, \\"Review of Aght'amar: Church of the Holy Cross\\". Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies. Vol. 30, No. 2, 1967, pp. 409-410. assert that the friezes parallel contemporary motifs found in Umayyad art - such as a turbaned prince, Arab styles of dress, wine imagery; allusions to royal Sassanian imagery are also present (griffins, for example). =Vandalism= After 1915, the church has been exposed to extensive vandalism. Before the restoration of the church, the reliefs on the church wall used as a shooting range. Zakarya Mildanoƒülu, an architect who was involved in the restoration process of the church, explains the situation during an interview with Hrant Dink as \\"The facade of the church is full of bullet holes. Some of them are so big that they can not be covered during the renovation process.\\" \\"Acele Restorasyona ≈ûeytan Karƒ±≈üƒ±r!.\\" Agos. July 2, 2005. During many conferences related to the restoration of the Akhtamar church, the process of covering the bullet holes are identified as the hardest part of the restoration by academicians and architects. \\"Payla≈üƒ±lan Bir Restorasyon S√ºreci: Akhtamar Surp Ha√ß Kilisesi.\\" Mimarizm. February 26, 2008. \\"Akthamar Kilisesi Restorasyonu Sempozyumu.\\" Mimdap. February 26, 2008. Some claim that the Armenian churches and gravestones have been exposed to vandalism as a part of the Turkish government policy which aims to destroy the Armenian heritage in Anatolia. In 1951 an order was issued to demolish the church, but the writer Yasar Kemal managed to stop its destruction. He explained the situation to Alain Bosquet as \\"I was in a ship from Tatvan to Van. I met with a military officer Dr. Cavit Bey on board. I told him, in this city there is a church descended from Armenians. It is a masterpiece. These days, they are demolishing this church. I will take you there tomorrow. This church is a monument of Anatolia. Can you help me to stop the destruction? The next day we went there with the military officer. They have already demolished the small chapel next to the church. The military officer became angry and told the workers, \\"I am ordering you to stop working. I will meet with governor. There will be no movement until I return to the island again\\". The workers immediately stopped the demolition. We arrived at Van city center. I contacted the newspaper Cumhuriyet. They informed the Ministry of Education about the demolition. Two days later, Minister Avni Ba≈üman telegraphed the Van governor and ordered to stop the demolition permanently. June 25, 1951, the day when the order came, is the liberation day of the church.\\" =Restoration= The cross was mounted on top of the Armenian cathedral after restoration. Between May 2005 and October 2006, the church underwent a controversial restoration program. The restoration had a stated budget of 2 million Turkish Lira (approximately 1.4 million USD) and was financed by the Turkish Ministry of Culture. It officially re-opened as a museum on 29 March 2007 in a ceremony attended by the Turkish Minister of Culture, government officials, ambassadors of several countries, Patriarch Mesrob II (spiritual leader of the Armenian Orthodox community of Turkey), a delegation from Armenia headed by the Deputy to the Armenian Minister of Culture, and a large group of invited journalists from many news organizations around the world.\\"Ankara restores Armenian church.\\" BBC News. March 29, 2007. √ñzdemir √áakacak, the Governor of Van, described the refurbishing of the church as \\"a show of Turkey's respect for history and culture\\".Doƒüan, Ibrahim. \\"Restored Armenian church reopened with prayers as museum.\\" Today's Zaman.

March 30, 2007. According to Maximilian Hartmuth, an academician at Sabancƒ± University, \\"the church was turned into a museum rather than re-opened as a place of worship following the restoration was, for example, claimed to be a wedge separating the monument from Turkey‚Äôs Armenian community. The critics, writing for media such as Radikal, Milliyet, or Turkish Daily News, furthermore lamented that permission to re-mount the cross on top of the church was not given. Moreover, they argued, the official name of the museum, the Turkish Akdamar (translating as ‚Äúwhite vein‚Äù) rather than the original Armenian Ahtamar ‚Äì the name of the island in Lake Van on which the church stands and Surp Ha√ß (Holy Cross) for the church itself would suggest this to be a Turkish monument. At the same time only sparing use was made of the word ‚ÄúArmenian‚Äù in official statements. With Turkey's Armenian community not granted the privilege to hold a service at least once a year - as had been requested - and a large Turkish flag flying over the island, it was suggested by some critics that this project really announced the ‚ÄúTurkification‚Äù of this monument, the initiative being no more than a media stunt.\\" =Controversies= Armenian religious leaders invited to attend the opening ceremony opted to boycott the event, because the church was being reopened as a secular museum. Controversy surrounded the issue of whether the cross atop the dome until 1915 should be replaced. Some Armenians said that the renovation was unfinished until the cross was replaced, and that prayer should be allowed inside at least once a year. A cross had been prepared nearly a year before the opening, and Mesrob II petitioned the Prime Minister and Minister of Culture to place the cross on the dome of the cathedral. \\"ƒ∞≈üte Akdamar ha√ßƒ± .\\" Habert√ºrk. April 10, 2007. Turkish officials cited technical difficulties related to the structure of the restored building which may not be able to safely hold a heavy cross on top without further reinforcement. The controversial cross was erected on the top of the church on October 2, 2010. \\"Akdamar'ƒ±n ha√ßƒ± takƒ±ldƒ±\\" Ntvmsnbc The cross was sent by the Armenian Patriarchate of Istanbul to Van by plane. It is 2 meters high and weigh 110 kilograms. It was put on top of the church after being sanctified by Armenian clergymen. Since 2010, every year a mass is held in the church too. The opening was controversial among some Turkish nationalist groups, who protested at the island and in a separate demonstration in Ankara. Police detained five Turkish nationals who carried a banner declaring \\"The Turkish people are noble. They would never commit genocide.\\" Demonstrators outside the Ministry of the Interior in Ankara chanted slogans against the possibility of a cross being erected atop the church, declaring \\"You are all Armenians, we are all Turks and Muslims\\". H√ºrriyet columnist Cengiz √áandar characterized the way the Turkish government handled the opening as an extension of an ongoing \\"cultural genocide\\" of the Armenians. He characterizes the renaming of the church from Armenian to Turkish as part of a broader program to rename Armenian historical sites in Turkey, and attributes the refusal to place a cross atop the church as symptomatic of religious intolerance in Turkish society. (This was written before the cross was placed at its place on top of the church in 2010) Turkish deputy minister for culture, ƒ∞smet Yƒ±lmaz cited technical reasons for not being able to place a cross atop the dome of the church: Although this explanation from the government met with doubts, after the cross was erected on the dome of the church in 2010 (which weighed 110 kg - about half of what the Turkish deputy minister spoke about), after 2011 Van earthquake cracks appeared around the dome of the church. √áandar notes that the Agos issue published on the day of the murder of Hrant Dink featured a Dink commentary on the Turkish government's handling of the Akdamar issue, which the late journalist characterized as \\"A real comedy... A real tragedy...\\" According to Dink, Historian Ara Sarafian has answered some criticism of the Akdamar project, stating that, on the contrary, the project represents an answer to allegations of cultural genocide. He has stated that the revitalization of the site is \\"an important peace offering\\" from the Turkish government.\\"Armenian historian: Akdamar Church re-opening a 'peace-offering' from Turkey.\\" H√ºrriyet. April 9, 2007. The Armenian delegation attending the opening, led by the Deputy Minister of Culture and Youth Affairs; Gagik Giurjyan, faced obstacles on their way to the opening. They had to travel 16 hours by bus through Georgia to Turkey, due to the closure of the Turkish-Armenian border by Turkey. Ian Herbert, writing in The Independent, records his own experiences traveling in Turkey on an invitation from the Turkish government in the period of the opening of Akdamar: Cengiz Aktar, an academic of Galatasaray University, also took a critical stance towards the loss of the island's original name in his article titled \\"White Vein church and others\\" (Akdamar means \\"white vein\\" in Turkish). Aktar, Cengiz. Beyazdamar kilisesi ve diƒüerleri , March 23, 2007, Agos. Not all the comments were negative of the restoration of the church by the Turkish government.

It is a mountain with parasitic vents and a caldera up to wide. Most of the volcano is formed by trachytic lava flows, but hyaloclastite is also found. Snow, ice, and glaciers cover most of Mount Takahe. With a volume of , it is a massive volcano; the parts of the edifice that are buried underneath the West Antarctic Ice Sheet are probably even larger. It is part of the West Antarctic Rift System along with eighteen other known volcanoes. The volcano was active in the Quaternary. Radiometric dating has yielded ages of 300,000years and less for its rocks; the fast-growing volcano reached its present height about 200,000 years ago. Several tephra layers encountered in ice cores at Mount Waesche and Byrd Station have been attributed to Mount Takahe, although some of them were later linked to eruptions of Mount Berlin instead. The tephra layers were formed by explosive or phreatomagmatic eruptions. Major eruptions took place around 17,700years ago‚Äîpossibly forming an ozone hole over Antarctica‚Äîand in the early Holocene. Mount Takahe's last eruption occurred about 7,600 years ago; there is no present-day activity.  Geography and geomorphology  Mount Takahe is at the Bakutis Coast, eastern Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica. Bear Peninsula and the Amundsen Sea coast are north of Mount Takahe. It is an isolated mountain, and the closest volcanoes are Mount Murphy and Toney Mountain away. No major air routes or supply roads to Antarctic stations pass close to the volcano, and some parts of the edifice are accessible only by helicopter. The name of the volcano refers to the takahe, a flightless nearly extinct bird from New Zealand; members of the 1957‚Äì1958 Marie Byrd Land Traverse party nicknamed an aircraft that had resupplied them \\"takahe\\". Mount Takahe was first visited in 1957‚Äì1958 and again in 1968. The volcano rises above the ice level to a maximum elevation of . It is an undissected nearly perfect cone, a shield volcano with an exposed volume of about . The subglacial part, which might bottom out at below sea level, could have an even larger volume and is elongated in an east‚Äìwest direction. On its summit lies a flat, snow-filled caldera with a and volcanic neck. A lava dome may crop out inside the caldera. Radial fissure vents are found around the volcano, and vents also occur around the caldera rim. There are at least three parasitic vents with basaltic composition on its lower flanks, with three cinder cones found on the western and southern slopes. One of these cinder cones has been described as a subdued vent. The Jaron Cliffs are found on the southern slope. Cliffs on the lower part of the volcano Only twelve outcrops, with a total area of less than , emerge from the ice that covers Mount Takahe. The interior structure of the volcano is unknown. Based on these outcrops, lava flows with a thickness of appear to be widespread on Mount Takahe, while pyroclastic rocks such as deposits of Strombolian eruptions, lapilli tuffs and lahar deposits are less common. Occurrences of pyroclastic rocks at the summit have been correlated with tephra deposits elsewhere in Antarctica. Additional, obsidian-bearing and recently erupted lava bomb-and-block units crop out in the caldera rim, at Bucher Rim. = Glaciation = Mount Takahe is almost entirely covered by ice of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which rises about above sea level. A tributary of the Thwaites Glacier passes close to Mount Takahe. There are two small glaciers on the volcano itself, on the southwestern and northern flanks. They are eroding eruption products from the summit area, and moraines have been mapped both on the western flank and in the summit caldera. Glacial erosion is not pronounced, only a few corries cut into the lower slopes. The ice cover on the mountain includes both snow-covered and ice-covered areas, with sastrugi and other wind-roughened surfaces. The polar environment is cold and dry, which slows weathering processes. Air temperatures recorded at Mount Takahe are usually below freezing. Some rock units at the foot of the volcano were emplaced underneath ice or water and feature hyaloclastite and pillow lavas. These units rise to about above the present-day ice level. Some of these units, such as Gill Bluff, M√∂ll Spur and Stauffer Bluff, are \\"hydrovolcanic deltas\\" comparable to lava deltas. They crop out at the base of the volcano and are well preserved. Ice elevation was not stable during the emplacement of these deltas, and meltwater drained away, leading to the formation of diverse structures within the hyaloclastite deltas. The deltas may have formed during ice highstands 66,000 and 22,000‚Äì15,000years ago.  Geology  The West Antarctic Rift System is a basin and range province similar to the Great Basin in North America; it cuts across Antarctica from the Ross Sea to the Bellingshausen Sea. The Rift became active during the Mesozoic. Owing to thick ice cover it is not clear whether it is currently active, and there is no seismic activity. Most of the Rift lies below sea level. To the south it is flanked by the Transantarctic Mountains and to the north by the volcanic province of Marie Byrd Land. Volcanic activity in Marie Byrd Land commenced about 34million years ago, but high activity began 14million years ago. A major uplifted dome, in width, is centred on the Amundsen Sea coast and is associated with the Rift. Topographic map of Mount Takahe About 18 central volcanoes were active in Marie Byrd Land from the Miocene to the Holocene. Among the volcanic areas in Marie Byrd Land are the Flood Range with Mount Berlin, the Ames Range, the Executive Committee Range with Mount Sidley and Mount Waesche, the Crary Mountains, Toney Mountain, Mount Takahe and Mount Murphy. These volcanoes mainly occur in groups or chains, but there also are isolated edifices. Mount Takahe could be the largest of these volcanoes, comparable to Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa. Most of these volcanoes are large, capped off by a summit caldera and appear to have begun as fast-growing shield volcanoes. Later, calderas formed. Eventually, late in the history of the volcanoes parasitic vents were active. The volcanoes are all surmounted by rocks composed of trachyte, phonolite, pantellerite, or comendite. Their activity has been attributed either to the reactivation of crustal structures or to the presence of a mantle plume. The volcanoes rise from a Paleozoic basement. Mount Takahe may feature a large magma chamber and a heat flow anomaly underneath the ice has been found at the volcano. A magnetic anomaly has also been linked to Mount Takahe. = Composition = Trachyte is the most common rock on Mount Takahe, phonolite being less common. Basanite, hawaiite, and mugearite are uncommon, but the occurrence of benmoreite and pantellerite has been reported, and some rocks have been classified as andesites. Hawaiite occurs exclusively in the older outcrops, basanite only in parasitic vents and mugearite only on the lower sector of the volcano. Despite this, most of the volcano is believed to consist of mafic rocks with only about 10‚Äì15% of felsic rocks, as the upper visible portion of the volcano could be resting on a much larger buried base. The parasitic vents probably make up less than 1% of the edifice. Ice-lava interactions produced hyaloclastite, palagonite and sideromelane. No major changes in magma chemistry occurred during the last 40,000years but some variation has been recorded. All these rocks appear to have a common origin and define an alkaline‚Äìperalkaline suite. Phenocrysts include mainly plagioclase, with less common olivine and titanomagnetite; apatite has been reported as well. The magmas appear to have formed through fractional crystallization at varying pressures, and ultimately came from the lithosphere at depth, that was affected by subduction processes over 85million years ago.  Eruption history  The volcano was active in the late Quaternary. Radiometric results reported in 1988 include ages of less than 360,000years for rocks in the caldera rim and of less than 240,000years for volcanic rocks on the flanks. In his 1990 book \\"Volcanoes of the Antarctic Plate and Southern Oceans\\" LeMasurier gave 310,000¬±90,000years old as the oldest date for samples tested, citing unpublished K-Ar dates, but in a 2016 review of dates for Mount Takahe LeMasurier reported that none were older than 192,000years. A 2013 paper also by LeMasurier reported maximum ages of 192,000years for caldera rim rocks and of 66,000years for lower flank rocks. The entire volcano may have formed in less than 400,000years or even less than 200,000years, which would imply a fast growth of the edifice. 192,000¬±6,300years-old rocks are found at the summit caldera, implying that the volcano had reached its present-day height by then. Early research indicated that most of Mount Takahe formed underneath the ice, but more detailed field studies concluded that most of the volcano developed above the ice surface. The ice surface has fluctuated over the life of Mount Takahe, explaining why units originally emplaced under ice or water now lie above the ice surface and alternate with lava flow deposits. These elevated deposits were emplaced about 29,000‚Äì12,000years ago while the lava delta-like deposits are between about 70,000and 15,000years old. After it grew out of the ice, Mount Takahe increased in size through the emission of lava flows with occasional pyroclastic eruptions. Outcrops in the summit region indicate that most eruptions were magmatic, but some hydromagmatic activity occurred. Cinder cones and tuff cones formed during the late stage of activity. = Tephra in ice cores = Tephra layers in ice cores drilled at Byrd Station have been attributed to Mount Takahe. The volcano reaches an altitude high enough that tephras erupted from it can readily penetrate the tropopause and spread over Antarctica through the stratosphere. The occurrence of several volcanic eruptions in the region about 30,000years ago has been suggested to have caused a cooling of the climate of Antarctica, but it is also possible that the growth of the ice sheets at that time squeezed magma chambers at Mount Takahe and thus induced an increase of the eruptive activity. Assuming that most tephra layers at Byrd come from Mount Takahe, it has been inferred that the volcano was very active between 60,000 and 7,500 years ago, with nine eruptive periods and two pulses between 60,000‚Äì57,000and 40,000‚Äì14,000years ago. In the latter part of the latter period hydrovolcanic eruptions became dominant at Mount Takahe, with a maximum around the time when the Wisconsin glaciation ended. It is possible that between 18,000‚Äì15,000years ago, either a crater lake formed in the caldera or the vents were buried by snow and ice. The caldera itself might have formed between 20,000‚Äì15,000years ago, probably not through a large explosive eruption. It cannot be entirely ruled out that Byrd Station tephras originate at other volcanoes of Marie Byrd Land such as Mount Berlin. In particular, tephra layers between 30,000and 20,000years ago have been attributed to the latter volcano. Tephra layers from Mount Takahe have also been found at Dome C, Dome F, Mount Waesche, Siple Dome and elsewhere in Antarctica. Volcanic eruptions at Mount Takahe lack the pyroclastic flow deposits observed in other large explosive eruptions. The thickness of the Byrd ice core tephras attributed to Mount Takahe suggested that the eruptions were not large, but later research has indicated that large Plinian eruptions also occurred. A series of eruptions about 200 years long took place at Mount Takahe 17,700years ago. These eruptions have been recorded from ice cores at the WAIS Divide and at Taylor Glacier in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, where they constrain estimates of the rate of deglaciation. These eruptions released a large quantity of halogens into the stratosphere, which together with the cold and dry climate conditions of the last glacial maximum would presumably have led to massive ozone destruction and the formation of an ozone hole. Bromine and sulfur isotope data indicate that the amount of UV radiation in the atmosphere did increase at that time in Antarctica. As is the case with the present-day ozone hole, the ozone hole created by the Takahe eruptions might have altered the Antarctic climate and sped up deglaciation, which was accelerating at that time, but later research has determined that the warming was most likely not volcanically forced. = Holocene and recent activity = Activity waned after this point, two hydromagmatic eruptions being recorded 13,000and 9,000years ago and a magmatic eruption 7,500years ago. This last eruption is also known from the Byrd ice core and may correspond to an eruption 8,200¬±5,400years ago recorded at the Takahe edifice and to two 6217 and 6231 BC tephra layers at Siple Dome. Tephra from a 8,200before present eruption has been recorded at Siple Dome and Mount Waesche. A 7,900before present eruption at Mount Takahe is one of the strongest eruptions at Siple Dome and Byrd Station of the last 10,000years. Another eruption reported by the Global Volcanism Program may have occurred in 7050 BC. At Siple Dome, a further eruption between 10,700 and 5,600years ago is recorded and one tephra layer around 1783 BC (accompanied by increased sulfate concentrations in ice) might also come from Mount Takahe. Glass shards at Law Dome emplaced in 1552 and 1623 AD may come from this volcano as well. The Global Volcanism Program reports 5550 BC as the date of the most recent eruption, and the volcano is currently considered dormant. There is no evidence of fumarolic activity or warm ground, unlike at Mount Berlin, which is the other young volcano of Marie Byrd Land. Mount Takahe has been prospected for the possibility of obtaining geothermal energy.

Binary data occurs in many different technical and scientific fields, where it can be called by different names: * \\"bit\\" (binary digit) in computer science, * \\"truth value\\" in mathematical logic and related domains, * \\"binary variable\\" in statistics. Mathematical and combinatoric foundations A discrete variable that can take only one state contains zero information, and is the next natural number after 1. That is why the bit, a variable with only two possible values, is a standard primary unit of information. A collection of bits may have states: see binary number for details. Number of states of a collection of discrete variables depends exponentially on the number of variables, and only as a power law on number of states of each variable. Ten bits have more () states than three decimal digits (). bits are more than sufficient to represent an information (a number or anything else) that requires decimal digits, so information contained in discrete variables with 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10‚Ä¶ states can be ever superseded by allocating two, three, or four times more bits. So, the use of any other small number than 2 does not provide an advantage. A Hasse diagram: representation of a Boolean algebra as a directed graph Moreover, Boolean algebra provides a convenient mathematical structure for collection of bits, with a semantic of a collection of propositional variables. Boolean algebra operations are known as \\"bitwise operations\\" in computer science. Boolean functions are also well-studied theoretically and easily implementable, either with computer programs or by so-named logic gates in digital electronics. This contributes to the use of bits to represent different data, even those originally not binary. In statistics In statistics, binary data is a statistical data type consisting of categorical data that can take exactly two possible values, such as \\"A\\" and \\"B\\", or \\"heads\\" and \\"tails\\". As a form of categorical data, binary data is nominal data, meaning they represent qualitatively different values that cannot be compared numerically. However, binary data is frequently converted to count data by considering one of the two values as \\"success\\" and representing the outcomes as 1 or 0, which corresponds to counting the number of successes in a single trial: 1 (success) or 0 (failure); see . Often, binary data is used to represent one of two conceptually opposed values, e.g: *the outcome of an experiment (\\"success\\" or \\"failure\\") *the response to a yes-no question (\\"yes\\" or \\"no\\") *presence or absence of some feature (\\"is present\\" or \\"is not present\\") *the truth or falsehood of a proposition (\\"true\\" or \\"false\\", \\"correct\\" or \\"incorrect\\") However, it can also be used for data that is assumed to have only two possible values, even if they are not conceptually opposed or conceptually represent all possible values in the space. For example, binary data is often used to represent the party choices of voters in elections in the United States, i.e. Republican or Democratic. In this case, there is no inherent reason why only two political parties should exist, and indeed, other parties do exist in the U.S., but they are so minor that they are generally simply ignored. Modeling continuous data (or categorical data of more than 2 categories) as a binary variable for analysis purposes is called dichotomization (creating a dichotomy). Like all discretization, it involves discretization error, but the goal is to learn something valuable despite the error: treating it as negligible for the purpose at hand, but remembering that it cannot be assumed to be negligible in general. =Binary variables= A binary variable is a random variable of binary type, meaning with two possible values. Independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) binary variables follow a Bernoulli distribution, but in general binary data need not come from i.i.d. variables. Total counts of i.i.d. binary variables (equivalently, sums of i.i.d. binary variables coded as 1 or 0) follow a binomial distribution, but when binary variables are not i.i.d., the distribution need not be binomial. =Counting= Like categorical data, binary data can be converted to a vector of count data by writing one coordinate for each possible value, and counting 1 for the value that occurs, and 0 for the value that does not occur. For example, if the values are A and B, then the data set A, A, B can be represented in counts as (1, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1). Once converted to counts, binary data can be grouped and the counts added. For instance, if the set A, A, B is grouped, the total counts are (2, 1): 2 A's and 1 B (out of 3 trials). Since there are only two possible values, this can be simplified to a single count (a scalar value) by considering one value as \\"success\\" and the other as \\"failure\\", coding a value of the success as 1 and of the failure as 0. For example, if the value A is considered \\"success\\" (and thus B is considered \\"failure\\"), the data set A, A, B would be represented as 1, 1, 0. When this is grouped, the values are added, while the number of trial is generally tracked implicitly. For example, A, A, B would be grouped as 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 successes (out of n = 3}} trials). Going the other way, count data with n = 1 is binary data, with the two classes being 0 (failure) or 1 (success). Counts of i.i.d. binary variables follow a binomial distribution, with the total number of trials (points in the grouped data). =Regression= Regression analysis on predicted outcomes that are binary variables is known as binary regression; when binary data is converted to count data and modeled as i.i.d. variables (so they have a binomial distribution), binomial regression can be used. The most common regression methods for binary data are logistic regression, probit regression, or related types of binary choice models. Similarly, counts of i.i.d. categorical variables with more than two categories can be modeled with a multinomial regression. Counts of non-i.i.d. binary data can be modeled by more complicated distributions, such as the beta-binomial distribution (a compound distribution). Alternatively, the relationship can be modeled without needing to explicitly model the distribution of the output variable using techniques from generalized linear models (GLM), such as quasi-likelihood and a quasibinomial model; see . In computer science A binary image of a QR Code, representing 1 bit per pixel, as opposed to a typical 24-bit true color image. In modern computers, binary data refers to any data represented in binary form rather than interpreted on a higher level or converted into some other form. At the lowest level, bits are stored in a bistable device such as a flip-flop. While most binary data has symbolic meaning (except for don't cares) not all binary data is numeric. Some binary data corresponds to computer instructions, such as the data within processor registers decoded by the control unit along the fetch-decode-execute cycle. Computers rarely modify individual bits for performance reasons. Instead, data is aligned in groups of a fixed number of bits, usually 1 byte (8 bits). Hence, \\"binary data\\" in computers are actually sequences of bytes. On a higher level, data is accessed in groups of 1 word (4 bytes) for 32-bit systems and 2 words for 64-bit systems. In applied computer science and in the information technology field, the term binary data is often specifically opposed to text-based data, referring to any sort of data that cannot be interpreted as text. The \\"text\\" vs. \\"binary\\" distinction can sometimes refer to the semantic content of a file (e.g. a written document vs. a digital image). However, it often refers specifically to whether the individual bytes of a file are interpretable as text (see character encoding) or cannot so be interpreted. When this last meaning is intended, the more specific terms binary format and text(ual) format are sometimes used. Semantically textual data can be represented in binary format (e.g. when compressed or in certain formats that intermix various sorts of formatting codes, as in the DOC format used by Microsoft Word); contrarily, image data is sometimes represented in textual format (e.g. the X PixMap image format used in the X Window System).

Toney Mountain is an elongated volcanic massif that rises from a basaltic lava plateau. A wide summit caldera tops the volcano, and is elongated in east-west direction; this orientation is shared with calderas on other volcanoes in Marie Byrd Land and reflects regional tectonic stress. The slopes of the volcano feature parasitic vents and glacial corries, and are much steeper north of the volcano than south of it. Most of the mountain is covered by ice and its eastern sector may be a crater. That the mountain is mostly ice covered makes it difficult to determine its composition, the origin of the elongated shape of the volcano and the volcanological relation between the parasitic cinder cones and the main volcanic pile. Its volume may be about . The plateau and parasitic cones are formed by hawaiite and the few outcrops on the main volcano by benmoreite and comendite. They contain phenocrysts of olivine, plagioclase, pyroxene and titanaugite in the former and of clinopyroxene, feldspar and olivine. An age of 9.1 million years ago has been obtained on a basaltic lava flow beneath the volcano, and it has been inferred that the basal plateau formed between 10.1 and 9.1 million years ago. The massif is younger, with ages ranging from 1 million years in its lower parts to 500,000 years ago. Holocene eruptions may have also occurred at Toney Mountain as indicated by 30 kyr ash layers in ice cores from Byrd Station, although Mount Takahe and Mount Waesche are also candidates. During that time period, a number of volcanic eruptions occurred in Antarctica as recorded by ash layers in ice; this coincides with the coldest period of the Wisconsin glaciation and it is possible that the effects of ash clouds from the Antarctic eruptions caused this period of cold global temperatures. On the other hand, it is also possible that growing ice sheets during this period compressed magma chambers and thus triggered explosive eruptions. Toney Mountain lies in Marie Byrd Land, a tectonically and volcanically active region of Antarctica. There, a layer of basaltic rocks up to thick underlie a series of felsic volcanic edifices. These basaltic rocks in turn are emplaced above a Paleozoic basement with granite intrusions of Devonian-Cretaceous, which crops out in some mountain ranges. Beneath Toney Mountain, the basaltic floor rises from an elevation of beneath sea level, and the volcano is situated on the floor of a graben. The region is further characterized by a large dome-like uplift, part of the West Antarctic Rift System, and it may reflect the presence of a stationary hotspot. Toney Mountain was probably among those viewed from a distance by Admiral Byrd and others of the USAS in plane flights from the ship Bear in February 1940. It was mapped in December 1957 by the oversnow traverse party from Byrd Station to the Sentinel Range, 1957‚Äì58, led by C.R. Bentley who proposed the name. Named after George R. Toney, scientific leader at Byrd Station in 1957, a participant in several Antarctic and Arctic operations, serving in both field and administrative capacities.

It is 3,292 metres (10,801 ft) high, and stands 20 kilometres (12 mi) southwest of Mount Sidley, the highest volcano in Antarctica. The mountain lies southwest of the Chang Peak caldera and is largely covered with snow and glaciers, but there are rock exposures on the southern and southwestern slopes. The volcano may have been active as late as the Holocene, with tephra layers recovered from ice cores possibly originating from Mount Waesche. Seismic activity has been recorded both from the volcano and from an area south of it and might reflect ongoing volcanic activity.  Name  It was discovered by the United States Antarctic Service expedition on a flight on December 15, 1940, and named for Vice Admiral Russell R. Waesche, United States Coast Guard, member of the Antarctic Service Executive Committee.  Geography and geomorphology  Mount Waesche lies in Marie Byrd Land, one of the most inaccessible areas of Antarctica. It is one of 18 volcanoes in that region, which were active from the Oligocene to recent times. The origin of volcanic activity there has been correlated to the activity of a mantle plume underneath the crust. The region also includes the highest volcano in Antarctica, Mount Sidley, which reaches height. There may be as many as 138 volcanoes buried underneath the ice. The volcano is high. It is a double volcano, with the north-northeasterly Chang Peak caldera and the south-southwesterly Mount Waesche proper. The Chang Peak caldera is wide and the largest in Marie Byrd Land; Mount Waesche lies on the rim of the caldera. Mount Waesche is the more conspicuous peak and lava flows crop out on its southern and southwestern flank, while a wide caldera lies at its summit. On the northern side of Chang Peak caldera lies a high outcrop, and it and another outcrop consist of pumice and vitrophyre. Both volcanoes appear to be mainly formed by lava. At least five parasitic vents lie on the volcano, with several aligned on radial fissure vents; they are cinder cones and have erupted cinder, lava and volcanic bombs. A long large radial dyke projects from Mount Waesche and is the only part of the edifice where hyaloclastic tuff crops out. The Bennet Saddle separates Mount Waesche from Mount Sidley to the northeast. Mount Waesche is largely covered with snow and features several alpine glaciers as well as a blue-ice area. The volcano emerges through and is surrounded by the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which reaches an elevation of about above sea level at Mount Waesche and flows southward towards the Ross Ice Shelf. Blue ice is found in some areas. Glacial activity has altered the volcano, generating glacial striae and roches moutonnees on the older volcanic rocks and frost shattering landforms and solifluction ridges. Glacial drift lies on the ice-free southwestern flank. In turn, glacial moraines have been overrun by lava flows. Two sets of moraines formed by volcanic debris ‚Äì one containing ice, the other without ‚Äì lie on the southern and southwestern flank, reaching heights of and lengths of about . Surface exposure dating has indicated that they belong to an ice highstand that occurred about 10,000 years ago and that the volcanic rocks were probably extracted from underneath the ice.  Geology  Mount Waesche is part of the Executive Committee Range, which from north to south includes Mount Hampton, Mount Cumming with the parasitic vent Annexstad Peak, Mount Hartigan, Mount Sidley with Doumani Peak and Chang Peak-Mount Waesche. These mountains are all volcanic and feature ice-filled calderas, and many are paired volcanoes. Volcanic activity appears to be moving southward at a rate of . Seismic activity recorded in 2010 and 2011 south of Mount Waesche may indicate ongoing magmatic activity south of the youngest volcano. Chang Peak and Mount Waesche appear to be located outside of the Executive Committee Range volcanic lineament. The volcano erupted comendite, hawaiite and mugearite, with the former found at Chang Peak and the latter two at Mount Waesche proper; the parasitic cones have erupted a mugearite-benmoreite succession. The occurrence of rhyolite has also been reported. Phenocrysts at Chang Peak include aenigmatite, alkali feldspar, ilmenite and quartz and at Mount Waesche olivine, plagioclase and titanaugite. Granulite and pyroxenite xenoliths have also been found. Despite their proximity, Mount Sidley and Mount Waesche have erupted distinctly different rocks. Unusually for volcanoes in Marie Byrd Land, the chemistry of volcanic rocks at Mount Waesche appears to have changed over time.  Eruption history  The development of Mount Waesche began in the Pliocene, and Plio- Pleistocene tephra layers found in the Southern Pacific Ocean may originate at Mount Waesche. It appears that volcanism in the Executive Committee Range moved southwards over time, beginning at Mount Hampton and eventually arriving at Mount Waesche which is the young volcanic centre of the range. Chang Peak grew first, 1.6 million years ago or between 2.01.1 million years ago, while Mount Waesche formed within or about 1 million years ago; the youngest rocks at Waesche are less than 100,000 years old. Argon-argon dating on rocks that today form moraines has yielded ages of about 200,000 years to over 500,000 years. One flank vent has been dated to be 170,000 years old and some rocks are too young to be dated by potassium-argon dating. The volcano was active during the Holocene and may be a source of tephra found in ice cores. A layer of volcanic ash was identified in the region through radar data and is about 8,000 years old; it probably originated at Mount Waesche. The volcano today is considered to be \\"probably active\\" or \\"possibly active\\". Present-day seismic activity has been recorded at Mount Waesche, but it might be either volcanic/tectonic or caused by ice movement.

It began 2003 when EU member states invited dissidents to official receptions at their Cuban embassies. This sparked Cuba to cut off diplomatic relations with the EU. A compromise was eventually reached. Beginning The conflict started in 2003 after European embassies in Cuba made a policy to invite dissidents to diplomatic receptions in the Cuban capital Havana.Gibbs, Stephen (4 January 2005) Havana halts EU 'cocktail wars', BBC News All EU countries pledge to do this on their national day celebrations, such as to the French embassy on Bastille DayGibbs, Stephen (15 July 2003) Cuba's cocktail wars, BBC News and to the British embassy for the Queen's birthday. This move was in protest at Cuba's decision to imprison 75 dissidents and to execute 3 hijackers. The Cuban government, which calls its dissidents \\"mercenaries in the pay of the United States\\", took this as an insult and cut off almost all diplomatic relations with all European Union ambassadors and their embassies despite few dissidents willing to risk turning up to the events. Agreement In 2004, Cuba released 14 of the dissidents and an EU working group on Latin America recommended the policy be changed instead to promoting more discreet contacts with dissidents. After 20 months of tense relations, Brussels compromised by stating it would not ask Cubans to its diplomatic functions in future, be they dissidents or government ministers, rendering receptions useless as a diplomatic tool.Castle, Stephen (1 February 2005) Truce declared in 'cocktail wars' between EU and Cuba, The Independent This was welcomed by Havana and on 4 January 2005 Cuba normalised relations with Austria, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Sweden and the United Kingdom. It had already normalised relations with Spain who led calls for normalised relations. Despite the agreement not to invite dissidents, the EU did make clear it would seek to strengthen contacts with opposition groups in the country. Criticism However, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic were included as they had supported a hard line against Castro's regime, as did many other post-Communist EU states. Cuban dissidents also saw the compromise as the EU backing down over a very small act of protest. The Czech government stated it would ignore the agreement, saying it would invite whoever it wanted. Poland made similar remarks.

Purpose The purpose of WUSC-FM is to \\"educate and inform the listener and the DJ by providing musical diversity, information regarding student life and community events, and by airing Public Service Announcements.\\" It is not related to KUSC, the classical radio station owned by the University of Southern California; the two institutions happen to share initials. Content WUSC-FM is a free-format non-commercial educational radio station. The station's policy prohibits playing music that is in rotation at any other local station, or that has been on the Top 40 charts within the past 40 years. (This rule is sometimes ignored for special events, such as all-Beatles weekends or weekends devoted to the music of the 1980s). Some DJs have specialty shows, handling one genre such as soundtracks, hip-hop music, or electronic music. DJs who have \\"free-format\\" shows are required to play three genres of music during their show. Free- format show DJs are also required to grab 50 percent of what they play from heavy and light rotation. The station is owned and operated by the University of South Carolina. WUSC is governed by the Board of Student Publications and Communications, the Department of Student Life, the Director of Student Media, and the USC Board of Trustees (the USC Board of Trustees holds the station's license). A vast majority of the DJs at WUSC are current students at the university. However, the station allows faculty, staff, and WUSC alumni to host shows as well. One particular show, Red Bank Bar and Grill, has been aired off and on since 1978. It is currently the only show that is three hours long year-round; during the fall and spring semesters, shows are two hours long and air once per week. During summer and some academic breaks, shows become three hours long. Each DJ is responsible for the content of their show, and several of the shows have unique names and themes. Names in the Spring 2006 semester include \\"Bitch Stole My Fish\\", \\"Concordia Discourse\\", \\"Billfred in the Niiiiiightiiiiiiiiime!\\" (which airs on Friday mornings), \\"Ska is for Suckers\\", and \\"Still Questionable\\". Some notable shows over the years have included Locals Only (featuring bands from South Carolina, North Carolina, and Georgia), The Columbia Beet (local bands played live in the studio), the Red Bank Bar and Grill (an alternative country program), The Weekend Kicker (on Friday afternoons), Musical Mutiny (Sunday afternoons 1977-8, a progenitor of experimental/mash-up/sampling/\\"difficult\\" sounds; \\"Knox Abbott\\" was doing guerrilla radio about 30 years before it would become fashionable), Metal Cock Radio (an all heavy metal program), Origami (the station's first K-pop programming block), Blast From the Past (one of the earliest shows to focus on more esoteric music from the 1960s, first aired in 1978 and featuring groups such as the \\"Chocolate Watchband\\" and \\"Lothar and the Hand People\\"; a few years after the originator of the show had graduated and moved on, more recent listeners remember his apprentice, Freewheelin' Frank assuming the role of host). Some notable DJs have included Orlando (from the early 1970s), Steven Prazak (late 70s-early 80s), Terry Rosen (musician) (jazz programming, late 70s-early 80s), Uncle Gram (host of the Red Bank Bar and Grill), \\"Knox Abbott\\" (host of Musical Mutiny), Clair DeLune (host of the Blues Moon), \\"Aris\\" (70's-80's hosted a weekend show of folk/Celtic/etc.), Brent \\"Studdog\\" Riley (a long time alumni DJ), Marc Minsker (The Outside Jazz show), Brian Kushera (jazz), Alec Edelson (host of \\"Metal Cock Radio\\"), Brian Glazer (mainly news/talk, but did music shows, too), Mark Bryan (guitarist for the band Hootie and the Blowfish), and DJs B-Rad and Cadence (hosts of the Sunday night show \\"All the Vibes\\"). History WUSC began as an AM station broadcasting at 640 kHz in 1947. In 1958, it was allocated the frequency of 89.9 MHz but moved to 730 kHz in the mid 1960s. However, its first broadcast as WUSC-FM was not until January 17, 1977, at 91.9 MHz. During the period 1977‚Äì1982, one legal station ID featured a booming voice authoritatively announcing the station's \\"10,000 microwatts of power!\\", and another employed trumpet fanfare while majestically proclaiming, \\"...all the way to Cayce!\\", light-hearted jabs at the limited listening range of the ten watt signal. After \\"WUSC, Columbia,\\" in the background of the \\"...all the way to Cayce!\\" ID, one could hear a very laid-back male voice ask \\"...what about Elgin?\\" Due to the geological lay of the land in relation to the station's antenna, the ten watt signal was known to reach listeners in Elgin, SC to the northeast, as well as South Congaree, SC to the southwest, especially on cloudy or overcast days, even though WUSC's effective radiated range was approximately 2 miles. Elgin and South Congaree are townships situated on hills at approximately the same elevation as that original ten watt antenna, so there was no interference from tall buildings or other hills, and the frequency modulation wave could travel uninterrupted to these listeners' receivers, defying the distance limits. Despite its weak signal, the high quality station management and music programming WUSC enjoyed from the onset of its licensing on the FM band established it as a powerful, cutting edge musical force in the Greater Columbia area. WUSC subscribed to CMJ from the journal's inception in 1978: in so doing, WUSC's ten watt signal became one of a few brilliant beacons scattered across the national map, leading the country in the revolutionary underground music scene that would explode across America. By the time cable TV added MTV to its line-up in 1981, a significant portion of those cable TV subscribers in Columbia, SC immediately recognized MTV's \\"new\\" national artists as those which WUSC had been giving regular airplay since 1977. Due to a restructuring of FCC law regarding low power stations across the country in 1982, WUSC had to boost its signal to at least 100 watts or lose its license to broadcast. Ending broadcast was never considered an option from the moment the FCC announced the new requirements, as WUSC had made its indelible mark on the air waves in Columbia, recognized as a unique and invaluable contributor to the surrounding community. At the time, there was little cost difference between a boost to 100 watts vs. one of 3000 watts‚Äîfor example, the station would have to vacate the 91.9 frequency once its signal exceeded ten watts, regardless how powerful the new signal would be‚Äîadministrators, therefore, made the decision to increase the signal to 3000 watts. It was then that WUSC-FM moved to its current frequency of 90.5 MHz. In the early years of this new, wider-reaching phase of the station's existence, WUSC was led by Station Manager, Marc Fink; Program Director, Art Boerke; and Music Director, Rick \\"The Muffin Man\\" Wiener: this team instituted the fifty percent new music policy, insuring WUSC would continue its established role as one of Americas best, most respected college radio stations. The 3000 watt signal meant that specialty programming, such as Massive Metal, hosted by \\"Dredge Slug,\\" aka Carl Singmaster (who later founded Manifest Discs and Tapes), could now easily waft to the metalheads all throughout Lexington County, for example. Increased listener accessibility from this significantly more powerful signal led to greater regional recognition of WUSC, rapidly becoming more broadly popular across the Midlands. Soon WUSC was involved with bringing numerous live music shows to Columbia. WUSC-FM eventually had to reduce its power to its current 2,500 W because of fringe interference with another FM station. In 1986, WUSC was featured in Rolling Stone Magazine, referring to WUSC as one of \\"The Taste Makers\\", in the College Issue of that year. Although WUSC had a 14K webstream at the turn of the 21st century, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) introduced confusion to all Non-commercial educational (NCE) radio stations shortly afterwards. Due to the legal issues and exorbitant fees the DMCA threatened to impose, hundreds of NCE stations suspended all webstreaming beginning in 2002; WUSC was among these stations silenced on the web. In 2003, national legislators finally modified the DMCA such that NCE stations would be able to stream music and other copyrighted material at a reasonable cost, and WUSC-FM has been streaming its signal over the Internet regularly ever since. In June 2006, WUSC-FM upgraded to a new high-definition digital transmitter which cost $70,000. The new signal provides CD-quality digital audio and also improves reception in fringe areas. The new transmitter includes a data channel for station name, names of songs and artists, plus other information. It also makes it possible for WUSC to broadcast several channels of audio simultaneously. On March 26, 2007, WUSC sponsored an event where the world record for simultaneous yo-yoing was broken. The total number of people participating in the event was 932. =The 1995 shutdown= In 1995, WUSC was shut down and its executive staff fired. The incident came after Chris Carroll, who was USC's Director of Student Media at the time, levied several allegations against the station, such as the station's license being \\"flagged\\" by the FCC for revocation because of the airing of a song by the band Pansy Division, as well as several secondary violations. (The staff later learned that this, among several other allegations by Carroll, was unfounded.) Several members of the WUSC executive staff responded by publicly criticizing Carroll and the University administration through WUSC, The Daily Gamecock student newspaper and other local media outlets. As a result, the executive staff was removed by Jerry Brewer and Chris Carroll, and the station was operated solely by Carroll. The station remained off the air for a brief period before resuming under new leadership and DJs selected by the Board of Student Publications. (A few DJs returned to the station from before, but many were either not invited to return or left in protest.) Before the new executive staff was selected, the DJs were allowed to play what they wanted, resulting in Top 40 music being aired on the station. However, once in power, the new staff returned to the prior music policy. But the damage had been done, and the station was also dropped as a reporter to CMJ, which charts college radio airplay. Since Carroll's departure in 1997, the station has moved back towards its alternative/underground format, which had the station listed in some music journals as one of the top five college stations in the United States.

Along with the Rossano Gospels, the Sinope Gospels has been dated, on the basis of the style of the miniatures, to the mid 6th-century. The Rossano Gospels, however are considered to be earlier. Like Rossanensis and the Vienna Genesis, the Sinope Gospels are written on purple dyed vellum.  Description  There are only 44 extant folios in the Sinope Gospels. These folios carry unframed miniatures at the bottom of the page which are similar in style to the miniatures in the Rossano Gospels. The folios measure approximately 30 cm by 25 cm. It is written in one column per page, 15 lines per column, in silver writing and gold. It is written in very large uncial letters. The manuscript is very lacunose. ; Contents : Matthew 7:7-22; 11:5-12; 13:7-47; 13:54-14:4.13-20; 15:11-16:18; 17:2-24; 18:4-30; 19:3-10.17-25; 20:9-21:5; 21:12-22:7.15-24; 22:32-23:35; 24:3-12.

History  It was written in the 6th-century. The style of illustrations suggests Syria or Palestine (even Mesopotamia) as the place of its origin. The codex was purchased in 1899 at Sinope (hence its name), by a French officer from an old Greek woman. Its text was published by Henri Omont in 1901.

Before the genus Prumnopitys was distinguished, it was treated in the related genus Podocarpus as Podocarpus ferrugineus. It grows up to 25 m high, with a trunk up to 1.3 m diameter. The leaves are linear to sickle-shaped, 15‚Äì25 mm long and 2‚Äì3 mm broad, with downcurved margins. The plants are dioecious with pollen cones being solitary while those of female plants hang from a curved, scaly stalk. The seed cones are highly modified, reduced to a central stem 2‚Äì3 cm long bearing 1-3 scales, each scale maturing berry-like, oval, about 20 mm long and 10‚Äì15 mm broad, red to purple-red with a soft edible pulp covering the single seed. The seeds are dispersed by the New Zealand pigeon, which eats the very conspicuous 'berries' and passes the seeds in its droppings. It is found growing on both lowland terrain and on hill slopes throughout the two main islands as well as on Stewart Island/Rakiura (47¬∞ S). The Tree can live for at least 600 years. The scientific name ferruginea derives from the rusty colour of dried herbarium specimens of the leaves.

This included samples of red-slipped plainware ceramics that appeared to be in the tradition of the Lapita culture. The work, carried out by a team that included Pacific archaeology specialist Patrick Vinton Kirch, focused on a site called To'aga (site AS-13-1), a coastal stretch on the south coast of Ofu. The results showed continuous human habitation of about 3,000 years.  Ofu  South shore of Ofu seen from Olosega across the narrow strait that separates them. The sharp peak, an eroding dike complex, is named Sunu‚Äòitao. Ofu is the western part of the volcanic outcrop of Ofu-Olosega Island and the westernmost of the Manu'a Islands.Hills, J.W. (2010).

The main village of Ofu is located on the western shore, protected behind an offshore islet (eroded tuff cone) known as Nu'utele. Ofu has a small airport and a boat harbor that serve the population on Ofu and Olosega. The weekly flight from Pago Pago takes about half an hour. Olosega village 1896 Most of the southern shore and associated coral reef are part of the National Park of American Samoa. In 2005 the U.S. National Park Service was negotiating with village councils on Olosega to expand the park around that island. The island forms the Ofu County subdivision of the Manua District. It has a land area of 7.215 km¬≤ (2.786 sq mi), and had an official population of 176 persons as of the 2010 census. Situated on the south coast of the island is To'aga lagoon which has a high diversity of corals and fishes. The marine site has been part of long term research and study on coral reefs and global climate change. The island is also home to the Samoa Flying-fox (Pteropus samoensis), a species of bat threatened by habitat loss.  Olosega  Aerial view - Olosega village on the right, Ofu on the left.

Early life and career Bruce was born and raised in Glasgow, Scotland. He attended Hutchesons' Boys' Grammar School, Glasgow, before training as a chartered accountant, Ken‚Äôs first job was washing cars. He began his broadcasting career with the Hospital Broadcasting Service in Glasgow. Bruce became a staff announcer for BBC Radio 4 Scotland and after BBC Radio Scotland launched in November 1978, became one of the original presenters of Nightbeat alongside Iain Purdon. Charles Nove subsequently joined the presentation rota. He also presented a Saturday morning show. In 1980, he took on the mid-morning slot and then, in 1983, he presented a daily afternoon entertainment show. He hosted his mid-morning show on the BBC World Service in the late 1980s. Radio 2 =History= Bruce has presented multiple shows on BBC Radio 2. His first broadcasts were from Scotland when he took over the presentation of Radio 2 Ballroom from Scotland after the death of BBC Radio Scotland announcer/presenter of Scottish Dance Music programmes, David Findlay. He presented Radio 2 Ballroom programmes regularly from November 1980 until 1982 featuring Jim MacLeod and His Band mainly from their resident base of Dunblane Hydro Hotel. The Radio 2 Ballroom broadcasts are not mentioned by Ken Bruce much if at all and don't feature in his autobiography either. He joined Radio 2 more regularly in 1982 as a stand-in presenter, mainly covering for Ray Moore on the Early show. Bruce also presented shows for BBC Radio Scotland from London. Bruce became a regular presenter for Radio 2 in January 1984 when he assumed hosting duties for the Saturday late night show in addition to his continuing show on BBC Radio Scotland. In January 1985, Bruce replaced Terry Wogan on the breakfast programme, being replaced himself by Derek Jameson in April 1986. Following Wogan's death in 2016, his tenure of the show became the oldest for a presenter still living. He then began his first stint on the mid-morning show which lasted until the end of March 1990, when he took over the late show until the end of that year. He then hosted the early show throughout 1991, and on 6 January 1992 he returned to the mid-morning slot, where he remains today. As of 14 January 2019, Bruce follows Zoe Ball at 9:30 am and is followed by Jeremy Vine at 12 noon. On Thursday 1 August 2019 it was announced that his show had become the most popular radio programme in the UK, with 8.49m daily listeners, following a fall in the popularity of Zoe Ball's breakfast show. =Programme format and features= Bruce's show emphasises music, including regular live performances. Competitions are usually music-based, with a love song and dedications feature at 10:15 am. A music news slot with (usually) Matt Everitt appears at about 11:10 am on Thursdays. Other regular features include the Record of the Week and the Album of the Week and the Tracks of My Years, where a celebrity picks two songs each day for their particular meaning. The Love Song is played at 10:15 am each day, preceded by dedications, although a number of songs in the rotation are not romantic love songs (e.g. \\"At Seventeen\\" by Janis Ian, \\"The Greatest Love of All\\" by George Benson). The show also includes a daily quiz, PopMaster. It previously included other competitions such as Spin It to Win It and Words Don't Come Easily, although these were dropped in 2007 over possible abuse of phone-ins (despite no allegation of impropriety against Radio 2). PopMaster returned to Bruce's show in January 2008 with new jingles and a modified selection procedure where listeners had to register first and if successful the production team would call back. Bruce maintains a bantering relationship with the traffic presenter (Richie Anderson since May 2018, previously Lynn Bowles), whereby the two tease each other and respond to listeners' comments. Such comments are read throughout the programme, generally on a theme of the day, such as a news story. Although the programme's playlist is almost exclusively rock, pop and soul from the 1960s onwards, until early 2008 its Radio Data System flag identified it as programme type 12, \\"M.O.R.\\" It is now identified as programme type 10, \\"Pop music\\". From its beginning in 1992 until 15 May 1998, the show was two hours long, running from 9:30 to 11:30am. From and since 25 May 1998, the show was extended by 30 minutes, ending at 12:00pm. Stand-in presenters have included Richard Allinson, Simon Mayo, Aled Jones, Zoe Ball, Michael Ball, Claudia Winkleman, Fearne Cotton, Trevor Nelson and Gary Davies. The comedian and impressionist Rob Brydon, who is noted for his mimicry of Bruce, sat in for him on 25 August 2008 and again as an April fool prank in 2011 when Brydon impersonated Bruce throughout. Bruce took his first day off sick in 23 years on 10 September 2008. On that occasion, the show was presented by Richard Allinson. In 2013, the audience for the Ken Bruce Show reached a record 8.17 million. This was surpassed in 2019, as it became the most popular radio programme in the UK, with 8.49m weekly listeners. =PopMaster= PopMaster has run as a feature of Bruce's show since 16 February 1998. With questions set by music expert Phil Swern, it offers a DAB radio for successfully completing the 3 in 10 bonus round. If the listener fails, they are awarded a Bluetooth speaker (replacing the previous consolation prize of an mp3 player). An earlier consolation prize, a 'Space' radio, has been known to appear on eBay, to Bruce's amusement. The losing contestant is given a T-shirt with 'One Year Out' printed across the front (a catchphrase Bruce uses in the quiz when a contestant trying to place the year a song was in the charts is out by one year). This 'prize' replaced a CD wallet as of 27 February 2012. The public phone-in PopMaster quiz was suspended after airing on 18 July 2007. A celebrity version was quickly introduced on 20 July 2007, and continued until 18 January 2008. \\"3 in 10\\" was not played in the celebrity version and there was no tie-breaker in the event of a draw. It was rumoured that members of the public would be able to play again before Christmas 2007, however this did not happen. Following an announcement by Bruce on 7 January 2008, the normal format returned on 21 January 2008. The game returned with new dramatic, orchestral and guitar based jingles. Bruce himself was a Popmaster contestant during his show on 17 May 2013, when he took part in a special Eurovision edition of the quiz, live from Malmo, Sweden. Bruce competed against Paddy O'Connell with John Kennedy O'Connor chairing the quiz. =Notable events= While Bruce was on holiday in August 2007, he was briefly replaced by Davina McCall. This attracted more than 150 complaints from listeners. During his show on 21 April 2008, theatre producer Bill Kenwright told Bruce that Elvis Presley once visited London in 1958 and was taken on a tour of the city by Tommy Steele. It was believed that Presley had never visited England and the claim caused considerable controversy. In December 2008, a crew of fishermen listeners were inadvertently relaying the show to every ship and coastguard station for miles around. It was not possible to contact the vessel, so a request was made to Bruce, who duly said: \\"If you are on a ship near the Small rocks, please turn me off.\\" Soon after, while duetting with Steve Wright's 'Ask Elvis' (a.k.a. Mitch Benn), Bruce recorded a version of the Andy Stewart song ‚ÄúDonald, Where‚Äôs yer Troosers?‚Äù for the Bandaged CD to raise money for the charity BBC Children in Need. This was released as a download. In December 2008, Bruce was officially inducted into the Radio Academy Hall of Fame. On April Fools' Day 2011, Bruce's radio show was presented by comedian Rob Brydon impersonating Bruce throughout. Brydon interviewed \\"Sir Terry Wogan\\" (impersonated by Peter Serafinowicz), and Bruce himself appeared at the end of the show as his \\"brother Kenn with two Ns\\".\\"Rob Brydon impersonates Radio 2's Ken Bruce\\" , BBC News, retrieved 1 April 2011\\"Rob Brydon fools Ken Bruce's Radio 2 fans\\" , The Independent, retrieved 1 April 2011 Other appearances Bruce has presented BBC Proms in the Park for many years. Since 1988, he has been Radio 2's commentator for the Eurovision Song Contest, having taken over from fellow broadcaster and friend Ray Moore. In 1998, he shared this role with being UK spokesman for that year's contest, reading out the points for the UK telephone vote, taking it over from Colin Berry, who then returned the following year. and presented the Eurovision Song Contest Previews from 1989‚Äì1991 on BBC1. He is a regular presenter of the long-running Friday Night is Music Night. He occasionally makes appearances in the \\"Dictionary Corner\\" on Channel 4's Countdown, the latest during the week of 11 April 2011. When the original presenter Richard Whiteley died in 2005, Bruce said: \\"[he was] such a nice man ‚Äì that was the defining quality of him, a genuinely nice man. And he had no real ego.\\" In November 2007, he appeared on a Never Mind the Buzzcocks special for Children in Need. Bruce holds a PCV (Passenger Carrying Vehicle) driving licence and is the co-owner of a number of AEC Routemaster buses with Charles Nove, Alan Dedicoat and Steve Madden. He has referred to the buses as \\"a fantastic piece of engineering and such fun to have\\". On 3 March 2008, Bruce took part in Ready, Steady, Cook, broadcast on BBC Two with Lynn Bowles. Bruce and Bowles recorded Bring Me Sunshine for charity. On 30 December 2012, Bruce won an edition of Celebrity Mastermind with his specialist subject being the Jeeves novels of P.G. Wodehouse. In 2014, Bruce narrated the BBC One game show Reflex. On 4 October 2014, he took part in a celebrity episode of The Chase. Bruce featured with his son Charlie on the fifth series of Big Star's Little Star and in October 2018, he appeared as a cameo on Hollyoaks. Personal life Bruce has four sons and two daughters. His youngest son was born in February 2008. He lives with his third wife Kerith in Oxfordshire. One of his sons is autistic and Bruce is an active charity campaigner for autism. Bruce is a fan of Rangers Football Club, and occasionally remarks on their fortunes during his show. His autobiography was published on 4 September 2009, entitled The Tracks of My Years: The Autobiography. In September 2018, Bruce became the patron of Stoke Mandeville Hospital Radio, replacing former mayor of Aylesbury and long-standing patron and co-founder of the station, Freda Roberts MBE JP. Ken said \\"Hospital Radio continues to thrive and I am delighted to take on the role of patron.\\" References External links * Ken Bruce (BBC Radio 2) 1951 births Living people Scottish radio DJs Scottish radio personalities BBC Radio 2 presenters People educated at Hutchesons' Grammar School People from Glasgow ","title":"Ken Bruce"},{"id":"1364573","text":"the Courtauld Silk Mill in Halstead, Essex Samuel Courtauld (1793 ‚Äì 22 March 1881) was an English industrialist who developed his family firm, Courtaulds, to become one of the leading names in the textile business in Britain. Family Samuel Courtauld was the eldest son of George Courtauld, founder of George Courtauld and Co. The Courtauld family were descendants of Huguenot refugees who had settled in London and developed, over several generations, a highly regarded business as metalsmiths, working in both silver and gold. Courtauld's father, a younger son, had made two innovations to the tradition. Firstly, George Courtauld founded a business in textiles rather than silverware and as this business is still a leading concern to this day, it is with textiles that most people associate the family. However, in the 18th century the family was as renowned for its silverware, as it would be in the 19th century for its silk and crepe and in the 20th century for its man-made textiles. The second change to tradition was that George Courtauld, baptised in the French Protestant church of the London Huguenots, would become a keen Unitarian. Samuel Courtauld would follow his father in both regards. Samuel Courtauld adopted Louisa Ruth Lowe (n√©e Harris) after her mother died of puerperal fever some eleven days after her birth. When he died in 1881, she inherited his Essex estate of Gosfield Hall and much of his fortune. Business The Courtauld textile business was founded in 1794 in Pebmarsh in Essex. The business was originally \\"throwsters\\", that is producers of yarn, but later specialised in weaving as in silk and crepe fabrics. George Courtauld and his cousin Peter Taylor (1790‚Äì1850) developed the business over two decades, but faced difficulties in the lean years following the end of the Napoleonic Wars, when competition from the Continent was restored. In 1816, the father decided to retire from the business and hand over his share of the business to his son; it was to be the making of the firm. After a couple of years getting to grips with the business and bringing it back to profitability, the new manager felt sufficiently confident to embark on a major programme of expansion and innovation. In 1818, Samuel Courtauld built two further mills, at Halstead and at Bocking. At the end of 1824 the Halstead Mill was sold to Stephen Beuzeville. In 1825, Samuel. installed a steam engine at the Bocking mill. An agreement dated 19 January 1825 was drawn up between Beuzeville and Samuel Courtauld and his partners for the conversion of the Halstead mill for silk throwing. Beuzeville was to provide the expertise, capital, and supply the silk; Courtauld was to erect the machinery power looms and operate the mill in return for a share in the profits; Beuzeville was to take delivery of the yarn and manufacture the crepe for which he was a technical expert of 20 years experience. The mill appears to have been in operation by the summer of 1825, with Joseph Ash as manager. The introduction of new technology was important but the mills still remained heavily dependent on manpower, or more accurately, woman-power. The looms required supervision by an army of young female workers and even in 1838, more than 92% of the workforce was female. In 1827 Stephen Beuzeville was declared bankrupt; a formal deed of sale dated 11 April 1828 was created between the commissioners in bankruptcy and Samuel Courtauld, whereby Halstead Mill (subject to charges of ¬£300) was sold to Courtaulds for a cash payment of ¬£1,500. Stephen and his father joined Courtaulds as employees. In 1828, Samuel brought his brother George Courtauld II (1802‚Äì1861) into the partnership and as the business developed, further partners were admitted. George Courtauld turned the company from being a relatively insignificant local family firm into a major player in the industry, with a national, or even international, reputation. Other interests Courtauld used his growing economic power to support a range of political issues close to his heart. As an active supporter of the Whigs, he supported the momentous Reform Act, 1832 and he was also gave financial backing to the work of the Anti-Corn Law League. As an enthusiastic Unitarian, he was involved in the Nonconformist campaign against the paying of church rates to assist Anglican, and only Anglican, churches. By 1850, Courtauld was, by any estimate, an extremely successful man, in business and finance, but his great wealth was unable to do much to alleviate his increasing deafness. In 1854, Courtauld, now a man of some considerable fortune and standing in society, bought Gosfield Hall, a country house dating back to 1545, in the village of the same name, not far from Halstead. Courtauld devoted a great deal of time, effort and money to bring the house, and its large estate, to a standard suitable as the country seat of gentleman of means. The house is now a Grade I listed building but he would never fully enjoy the fruits of these labours as he was too firmly wedded to his business to contemplate retirement. He continued to play an active role in the company until just before he died in March 1881. Legacy The great riches generated by the success of the core textile business enabled later members of the family to pursue interests as patrons of the arts and philanthropists as well as in commerce. Notable members included Samuel Courtauld's great-nephews: *Samuel Courtauld (1876‚Äì1947): became Chairman of Courtaulds in 1921, but today is probably better known as the founder of the Courtauld Institute of Art in London. *Sir Stephen Courtauld MC (1883‚Äì1967), was also an arts patron and, like the earlier Samuel Courtauld, developed a talent for country house restoration. In 1933, began work on Eltham Palace in south-east London, where he and his wife lived until 1944.

S. Lewis. Puddleglum appears as a principal character in The Silver Chair, and is mentioned briefly at the end of The Last Battle. Puddleglum is a \\"Marsh-wiggle\\", a species invented by Lewis which appears only in this book, and the only Marsh-wiggle given a name or any lines of dialogue. He is gloomy and pessimistic and described by other characters as a \\"wet blanket\\", although by his account other Marsh-wiggles are gloomier still. Lewis said that his gardener Fred Paxford served as a model for Puddleglum. Name The name Puddleglum can be viewed as a concatenation of \\"Puddle\\" for Puddleglum's association with water and wetlands, and \\"glum\\" which describes his outlook on life. It likely derives from the translator John Studley, whose comical choices of words Lewis criticized: :[Studley] uses more often than his fellows that diction which... cannot now be read without a smile ‚Äì \\"frostyface\\", \\"topsy turvy\\", and (for Tacitae Stygis...) \\"Stygian puddle glum\\". The association is further strengthened by the fact that \\"Stygian\\" refers to the River Styx which was said to flow through the classical Underworld, and the three adventurers in The Silver Chair descend to the Narnian Underworld. Biographical summary =Character development= Puddleglum first appears in chapter 5 of The Silver Chair, where he introduces himself by saying, \\"Puddleglum's my name. But it doesn't matter if you forget it.\\" From then on, he is a caricature of pessimism and a bastion of gloomy fortitude: \\"I see you're making the best of a bad job. That's right. You've been well brought up, you have. You've learned to put a good face on things.\\" But in the end Lewis gives readers a small sign that maybe spending time with Eustace and Jill has had an effect on him. After Jill surprises him with a farewell hug (and kiss), Puddleglum remarks, \\"Well, I wouldn't have dreamt of her doing that. Even though I am a good-looking chap.\\" =In The Silver Chair= Puddleglum is the companion of Eustace and Jill as they search for Prince Rilian, heir to the Narnian throne, who disappeared 10 years earlier. He is a unique character in Lewis's works. He is neither dashing nor charming, neither a great fighter nor a clever strategist. Yet he is instrumental in breaking the Lady of the Green Kirtle's spell and releasing the Prince by stamping out her magical fire (badly injuring his foot in the process, though not as much as a normal human would, since his feet are webbed). While the children initially (and not entirely without merit) consider him a \\"wet blanket\\" who removes the good from any situation, he proves to be a strong and steadfast companion, especially in Underland where he is all they have to cling to. It is Puddleglum who often spots the best course of action, and ultimately Puddleglum who wins the debate with the Lady, using an argument that incidentally reveals that he has overcome his cynical and pessimistic ways. She reacts furiously and turns into a serpent, only to be killed by Rilian, who finally realizes that she was the serpent who had killed his mother 10 years earlier. He then joins Rilian and the two children on their escape from the Underworld to Narnia. Christian elements Lewis, himself an expert on allegory, did not consider The Chronicles of Narnia allegory. He saw them as \\"suppositional\\" answering the question, \\"What might Christ become like, if there really were a world like Narnia and He chose to be incarnate and die and rise again in that world as He actually has done in ours?' This is not allegory at all.\\" While not allegorical, Narnia does present significant parallels with elements from Christianity. Lewis is perhaps using Puddleglum to give a somewhat existential statement of faith when he writes, \\"Suppose we have only dreamed, or made up, all of those things‚Äîtrees and grass and sun and moon and stars and Aslan himself. Suppose we have. Then all I can say is that, in that case, the made-up things seem a good deal more important than the real ones... We're just babies making up a game, if you're right. But four babies playing a game can make a play-world which licks your real world hollow. That's why I'm going to stand by the play-world. I'm on Aslan's side even if there isn't any Aslan to lead it. I'm going to live as like a Narnian as I can even if there isn't any Narnia... and that's a small loss if the world's as dull as you say.\\" Lewis himself said of this passage: :I suppose your philosopher son... means the chapter in which Puddleglum puts out the fire with his foot. He must thank Anselm and Descartes for it, not me. I have simply put the 'Ontological Proof' in a form suitable for children. And even that is not so remarkable a feat as you might think. You can get into children's heads a good deal which is quite beyond the Bishop of Woolwich.Letter to Nancy Warner, 26 October 1963, in Lewis has, in sending the protagonists underground to a world which claims to be the only true one, also presented children with an inversion of Plato's allegory of the cave. Puddleglum, with Plato, recognizes the difference between the world of shadows, and the world with the sun. Portrayals *In the 1990 television serial produced by the BBC, The Silver Chair, Puddleglum was portrayed by Tom Baker, who was famous for portraying the 4th Doctor. *The voice of Puddleglum was provided by Ron Moody on Focus on the Family Radio Theatre's dramatization of The Silver Chair and by Bernard Cribbins in the BBC Radio adaptation of the same story.

The incident is a matter of some controversy. One source Jerzy Pertek, p. 321 states JastrzƒÖb was escorting PQ 15, i.e. travelling with the convoy. Others however Paul Kemp, p. 47Bernard Schofield, p. 60 state she was covering PQ 15‚Äôs passage by patrolling the Norwegian coast against a sortie by German capital ships, one of five submarines so assigned. These sources state JastrzƒÖb was out of position; Pertek however states that it was the convoy which was out of position,Jerzy Pertek, p. 323 and other sources confirm the convoy had altered course to avoid ice. The position of the incident, 200 miles from the Norwegian coast is inconsistent with a mission to patrol that coast, typically no more than 10 to 20 miles out. Pertek also (after Romanowski's testimony) states JastrzƒÖb was fired upon despite showing yellow recognition smoke candles; however other sources do not confirm this. Finally Pertek states the commanders of St Albans and Seagull were found guilty at a court martial over the incident; Kemp states that the court of enquiry (a normal procedure following the loss of a ship, though not of friendly fire cases) found no blame could be attributed to either commander.Paul Kemp, p. 49 It is not possible to reconcile these accounts. On 5 May 1942, the convoy reached Murmansk, where the Polish crew remained resting for two and a half months, then returned to Great Britain on board the Polish destroyer .Jerzy Pertek, p. 325  See also  * List of World War II ships * , another Polish submarine lost during World War II.

Description It is the smallest species of chipmunk, measuring about in total length with a weight of .Least chipmunk (Tamias minimus) , Arkive The body is gray to reddish-brown on the sides, and grayish white on the underparts. The back is marked with five dark brown to black stripes separated by four white or cream-colored stripes, all of which run from the nape of the neck to the base of the tail. Two light and two dark stripes mark the face, running from the tip of the nose to the ears. The bushy tail is orange-brown in color, and measures long. In some areas, where range overlap with the yellow-pine chipmunk occurs, it may be difficult or impossible to distinguish the two species in the field; laboratory examination of skeletal structures may be required. As in other chipmunks, there are four toes on each of the forefeet and five on the hindfeet. Females have eight teats. The brain to body mass ratio for least chipmunks is lower than that for other species of chipmunk living in the same area, suggesting that they prefer less complex environments. Distribution and habitat Least chipmunks are found through the western United States from northern New Mexico and western North and South Dakota to eastern California, Oregon and Washington, and throughout much of southern and western Canada from Yukon and southeastern British Columbia Nagorsen, D.W. (2005). \\"Rodents and Lagomorphs of British Columbia\\". Royal BC Museum, Victoria, BC to Ontario, and into the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and neighboring parts of Wisconsin and Minnesota. Throughout this range, as many as 21 subspecies have been identified. Less arboreal than other chipmunks, least chipmunks are commonly found in sagebrush habitats and coniferous woodland, and along rivers, but they also occur in alpine meadows, and on the edges of the northern tundra. Behavior Least chipmunks are diurnal and eat seeds, berries, nuts, fruits and insects. They mark areas depleted of suitable food with urine, and do not return to such patches afterwards. Home ranges vary widely, and have been reported to vary from in northern Michigan to as much as in Colorado. Because of their small size, least chipmunks are generally subordinate to yellow-pine chipmunks, which are able to drive them away from food resources where food is plentiful. However, because they need to eat less food in order to survive, least chipmunks are more numerous where resources are scarce. They are agile animals, and have been recorded running at speeds of up to in natural conditions. Predators include hawks, owls, and mustelids. Least chipmunks spend the winter in burrows and also scatter-hoard food in numerous concealed pits beneath logs and similar cover. Burrows consist of a single chamber about across and tunnels in diameter, averaging in length. They have two to four entrances, often concealed by nearby rocks, and are typically about below the surface. During the summer they may construct temporary nests in trees from leaves and grass, or appropriate hollows made by woodpeckers. Least chipmunks do not hibernate, or put on excess fat in the fall. Instead, they survive the winter by entering torpor for long stretches of time, waking to eat food cached in the burrow. How much of each winter they spend below ground in this manner depends on the latitude, varying from late November to mid March in Michigan to mid October to late April in northern Manitoba. Reproduction Females enter estrus within a week of emerging from their burrow in the spring, and mating typically takes place between March and May. Gestation lasts 28 to 30 days, with a single litter of three to seven young being born each year; females who lose their first litter soon after birth may, however, sometimes be able to breed again in the same year. The young are born hairless and blind, measuring about in length, and weighing . They are able to stand and open their eyes at 27 days, and are weaned at 36 days. They are sexually mature at one year, but do not always breed until their second year. They can live for up to six years in captivity.

She was launched in February 1858 as a packet ship and ferry for the Hayle and Bristol Steam Packet Company. Sleek and painted white, with two funnels mounted close together amidships and with a high bridge over her paddle wheels, she plied the Hayle/St Ives to Bristol route in the days when the Great Western Railway had not penetrated as far as West Cornwall. History Advert for the SS Cornubia from the Bristol Times and Mirror. Saturday 25 August 1860 She was given the name Cornubia from the Latinised name for Cornwall and was a fast iron paddle steamer, long and narrow at long and with a beam. Her Harveys-built twin oscillating side-wheel engines with four boilers and stroke produced and was capable of propelling the vessel at over . Her shallow, draft was initially designed to cope with the shallow harbours in Cornwall, but proved to be very useful in her later life. The accommodation on board was described in the Western Daily Press on Monday 19 July 1858 as > A capacious house, with plate-glass windows, tastefully designed, afforded > two entrances to the cabin stairs, and the hundreds of visitors who, on > Tuesday afternoon, came on board to \\"have a peep at the new boat\\" went down > those stairs with a sense of being about to look on \\"something out of the > common run.\\" Nor were they disappointed.

She ran between Bristol and Hayle from 1858 to 1861, calling additionally at Ilfracombe. By 1860 she was under the command of W.

She proved to be a very good investment. Her speed, manoeuvrability and shallow draft making her an excellent blockade runner. She successfully avoided and outran Union forces on 22 occasions bringing vital supplies to the confederate army at Wilmington. On her 23rd run on 8 November 1863, however luck ran out for Cornubia. She was pursued by and was forced to run up onto the beach at New Inlet. The ship's captain, Richard Gayle, the ship's carpenter and one seaman remained onboard and helped other crew and passengers to escape to shore. Later that same day, arrived on the scene and on the rising tide towed the still-intact Cornubia free. She was then sent to Boston as a Prize together with the bags of waterlogged mail. The abandoned mail proved to be a vital aid to the Union, gaining an insight into the Confederacy plans and in particularly the role that British seamen were taking in blockade running. Union Navy Service Cornubia was purchased from the Boston Prize court and then commissioned in the Union Navy on 17 March 1864 and assigned to the role of blockading the waters around Mobile and Pensacola, before later being reassigned to the coast of Texas. The blockade runner had now become a blockader. On 21 April 1865, Cornubia captured the blockade-running schooner Chaos. On 24 May, Cornubia captured the guard boat Le Compt where a cache of arms was found. Later the same day, Cornubia assisted in the pursuit and sinking of the Confederate steamer Denbigh. Following the evacuation of Galveston on 22 May, Cornubia was put on duty removing the harbour obstructions. On 3 August, Cornubia was officially decommissioned from the Union Navy and was sold on 25 October.

While LF may be the result of actual photons of visible light being sensed by the retina, the LF discussed here could also pertain to phosphenes, which are sensations of light produced by the activation of neurons along the visual pathway. Possible causes Researchers believe that the LF perceived specifically by astronauts in space are due to cosmic rays (high-energy charged particles from beyond the Earth's atmosphere), though the exact mechanism is unknown. Hypotheses include Cherenkov radiation created as the cosmic ray particles pass through the vitreous humour of the astronauts' eyes, direct interaction with the optic nerve, direct interaction with visual centres in the brain, retinal receptor stimulation, and a more general interaction of the retina with radiation. Conditions under which the light flashes were reported Astronauts who had recently returned from space missions to the Hubble Space Telescope, the International Space Station and Mir Space Station reported seeing the LF under different conditions. In order of decreasing frequency of reporting in a survey, they saw the LF in the dark, in dim light, in bright light and one reported that he saw them regardless of light level and light adaptation. They were seen mainly before sleeping. Types Some LF were reported to be clearly visible, while others were not. They manifested in different colors and shapes. How often each type was seen varied across astronauts' experiences, as evident in a survey of 59 astronauts. =Colors= On Lunar missions, astronauts almost always reported that the flashes were white, with one exception where the astronaut observed \\"blue with a white cast, like a blue diamond.\\" On other space missions, astronauts reported seeing other colors such as yellow and pale green, though rarely. Others instead reported that the flashes were predominantly yellow, while others reported colors such as orange and red, in addition to the most common colors of white and blue. =Shapes= The main shapes seen are \\"spots\\" (or \\"dots\\"), \\"stars\\" (or \\"supernovas\\"), \\"streaks\\" (or \\"stripes\\"), \\"blobs\\" (or \\"clouds\\") and \\"comets\\". These shapes were seen at varying frequencies across astronauts. On the Moon flights, astronauts reported seeing the \\"spots\\" and \\"stars\\" 66% of the time, \\"streaks\\" 25% of the time, and \\"clouds\\" 8% of the time. Astronauts who went on other missions reported mainly \\"elongated shapes\\". About 40% of those surveyed reported a \\"stripe\\" or \\"stripes\\" and about 20% reported a \\"comet\\" or \\"comets\\". 17% of the reports mentioned a \\"single dot\\" and only a handful mentioned \\"several dots\\", \\"blobs\\" and a \\"supernova\\". Motion A reporting of motion of the LF was common among astronauts who experienced the flashes. For example, Jerry Linenger reported that during a solar storm, they were directional and that they interfered with sleep since closing his eyes would not help. Linenger tried shielding himself behind the station's lead-filled batteries, but this was only partly effective. The different types of directions that the LF have been reported to move in vary across reports. Some reported that the LF travel across the visual field, moving from the periphery of the visual field to where the person is fixating, while a couple of others reported motion in the opposite direction. Terms that have been used to describe the directions are \\"sideways\\", \\"diagonal\\", \\"in-out\\" and \\"random\\". In Fuglesang et al. (2006), it was pointed out that there were no reports of vertical motion. Occurrences and frequencies There appear to be individual differences across astronauts in terms of whether they reported seeing the LF or not. While these LF were reported by many astronauts, not all astronauts have experienced them on their space missions, even if they have gone on multiple missions. For those who did report seeing these LF, how often they saw them varied across reports. On the Apollo 15 mission all three astronauts recorded the same LF, which James Irwin described as \\"a brilliant streak across the retina\\". =Frequency during missions= On Lunar missions, once their eyes became adapted to the dark, Apollo astronauts reported seeing this phenomenon once every 2.9 minutes on average. On other space missions, astronauts reported perceiving the LF once every 6.8 minutes on average. The LF were reported to be seen primarily before the astronauts slept and in some cases disrupted sleep, as in the case of Linenger. Some astronauts pointed out that the LF were seemingly perceived more frequently as long as they were perceived at least once before and attention was directed to the perception of them. One astronaut, on his first flight, only took note of the LF after being told to look out for them. These reports are not surprising considering that the LF may not stand out clearly from the background. =Fluctuations during and across missions= Apollo astronauts reported that they observed the phenomenon more frequently during the transit to the Moon than during the return transit to Earth. Avdeev et al. (2002) suggested that this might be due to a decrease in sensitivity to the LF over time while in space. Astronauts on other missions reported a change in the rate of occurrence and intensity of the LF during the course of a mission. While some noted that the rate and intensity increased, others noted a decrease. These changes were said to take place during the first days of a mission. Other astronauts have reported changes in the rate of occurrence of the LF across missions, instead of during a mission. For example, Avdeev himself was on Mir for six months during one mission, six months during the second mission a few years later and twelve months during a third mission a couple of years after. He reported that the LF were seen less frequently with each subsequent flight. Orbital altitude and inclination have also correlated positively with rate of occurrence of the LF. Fuglesang et al. (2006) have suggested that this trend could be due to the increasing particles fluxes at increasing altitudes and inclinations. Experiments =ALFMED experiment= Ron Evans wearing the ALFMED light- flash detector during the outbound flight from Earth During the Apollo 16 and Apollo 17 transits, astronauts conducted the Apollo Light Flash Moving Emulsion Detector (ALFMED) experiment where an astronaut wore a helmet designed to capture the tracks of cosmic ray particles to determine if they coincided with the visual observation. Examination of the results showed that two of fifteen tracks coincided with observation of the flashes. These results in combination with considerations for geometry and Monte Carlo estimations led researchers to conclude that the visual phenomena were indeed caused by cosmic rays. =SilEye-Alteino and ALTEA projects= The SilEye-Alteino and Anomalous Long Term Effects in Astronauts' Central Nervous System (ALTEA) projects have investigated the phenomenon aboard the International Space Station, using helmets similar in nature to those in the ALFMED experiment. The SilEye project has also examined the phenomenon on Mir. The purpose of this study was to examine the particle tracks entering the eyes of the astronauts when the astronaut said they observed a LF. In examining the particles, the researchers hoped to gain a deeper understanding of what particles might be causing the LF. Astronauts wore the SilEye detector over numerous sessions while on Mir. During those sessions, when they detected a LF, they pressed a button on a joystick. After each session, they recorded down their comments about the experience. Particle tracks that hit the eye during the time when the astronauts indicated that they detected a LF would have had to pass through silicon layers, which were built to detect protons and nuclei and distinguish between them. The findings show that \\"a continuous line\\" and \\"a line with gaps\\" was seen a majority of the time. With less frequency, a \\"shapeless spot\\", a \\"spot with a bright nucleus\\" and \\"concentric circles\\" were also reported. The data collected also suggested to the researchers that one's sensitivity to the LF tends to decrease during the first couple of weeks of a mission. With regards to the probable cause of the LF, the researchers concluded that nuclei are likely to be the main cause. They based this conclusion off of the finding that in comparison to an \\"All time\\" period, an \\"In LF time window\\" period saw the nucleus rate increase to about six to seven times larger, while the proton rate only increased by twice the amount when comparing the two time periods. Hence, the researchers ruled out the Cherenkov effect as a probable cause of the LF observed in space, at least in this case. =Ground experiments in the 1970s= Experiments conducted in the 1970s also studied the phenomenon. These experiments revealed that although several explanations for why the LF were observed by astronauts have been proposed, there may be other causes as well. Charman et al. (1971) asked whether the LF were the result of single cosmic-ray nuclei entering the eye and directly exciting the eyes of the astronauts, as opposed to the result of Cherenkov radiation within the retina. The researchers had observers view a neutron beam, composed of either 3 or 14 MeV monoenergetic neutrons, in several orientations, relative to their heads. The composition of these beams ensured that particles generated in the eye were below 500 MeV, which was considered the Cherenkov threshold, thereby allowing the researchers to separate one cause of the LF from the other. Observers viewed the neutron beam after being completely dark-adapted. The 3 MeV neutron beam produced no reporting of LF whether it was exposed to the observers through the front exposure of one eye or through the back of the head. With the 14 MeV neutron beam, however, LF were reported. Lasting for short periods of time, \\"streaks\\" were reported when the beam entered one eye from the front. The \\"streaks\\" seen had varying lengths (a maximum of 2 degrees of visual angle), and were seen to either have a blueish-white color or be colorless. All but one observer reported seeing fainter but a higher number of \\"points\\" or short lines in the center of visual field. When the beam entered both eyes in a lateral orientation, the number of streaks reported increased. The orientation of the streaks corresponded to the orientation of the beam entering the eye. Unlike in the previous case, the streaks seen were more abundant in the periphery than the center of visual field. Lastly, when the beam entered the back of the head, only one person reported seeing the LF. From these results, the researchers concluded that at least for the LF seen in this case, the flashes could not be due to Cherenkov radiation effects in the eye itself (although they did not rule out the possibility that the Cherenkov radiation explanation was applicable to the case of the astronauts). They also suggested that because the number of LF observed decreased significantly when the beam entered the back of the head, the LF were likely not caused by the visual cortex being directly stimulated as this decrease suggested that the beam was weakened as it passed through the skull and brain before reaching the retina. The most probable explanation proposed was that the LF were a result of the receptors on the retina being directly stimulated and \\"turned on\\" by a particle in the beam. In another experiment, Tobias et al. (1971) exposed two people to a beam composed of neutrons ranging from 20 to 640 MeV after they were fully dark-adapted. One observer, who was given four exposures ranging in duration from one to 3.5 seconds, observed \\"pinpoint\\" flashes. The observer described them as being similar to \\"luminous balls seen in fireworks, with initial tails fuzzy and heads like tiny stars\\". The other observer who was given one exposure lasting three seconds long, reported seeing 25 to 50 \\"bright discrete light, he described as stars, blue-white in color, coming towards him\\". Based on these results, the researchers, like in Charman et al. (1971), concluded that while the Cherenkov effect may be the plausible explanation for the LF experienced by astronauts, in this case, that effect cannot explain the LF seen by the observers. It is possible that the LF observed were the result of interaction of the retina with radiation. They also suggested that the tracks seen may point to tracks that are within the retina itself, with the earlier portions of the streak or track fading as it moves. Considering the experiments conducted, at least in some cases the LF observed appear to be caused by activation of neurons along the visual pathway, resulting in phosphenes. However, because the researchers cannot definitively rule out the Cherenkov radiation effects as a probable cause of the LF experienced by astronauts, it seems likely that some LF may be the result of Cherenkov radiation effects in the eye itself, instead. The Cherenkov effect can cause Cherenkov light to be emitted in the vitreous body of the eye and thus allow the person to perceive the LF. Hence, it appears that the LF perceived by astronauts in space have different causes. Some may be the result of actual light stimulating the retina, while others may be the result of activity that occurs in neurons along the visual pathway, producing phosphenes.

Wealthy. As shown, the district dates to at least the 1890s when this map was made. A map showing the Belsize Ward of Hampstead in 1916 The name is derived from French bel assis meaning 'well situated'. The area has many thoroughfares bearing its name: Belsize Avenue, Belsize Court, Belsize Crescent, Belsize Gardens, Belsize Grove, Belsize Lane, Belsize Mews, Belsize Park (the road), Belsize Park Gardens, Belsize Place, Belsize Square, and Belsize Terrace. The Manor of Belsize dates back to 1317, when as a subdivision to the Manor of Hampstead it was left to the Roman Catholic monks of Westminster Abbey. The original manor consisted of a number of subdivided farms, which were rented out for income. Hence after the reformation, King Henry VIII returned the estate to the newly constituted Anglican Dean of Westminster Abbey. By 1600, including the manor house there were at least three other properties on the estate, with diplomat and courtier Sir Isaac Wake (1581 ‚Äì 1632) having a substantial property built on the west side of the main London to Hampstead road. Inherited by his daughter and her husband Charles West (1626‚Äì1687) the fifth Baron de la Warr, it passed through various hands into the ownership of William Paget the 6th Baron Paget by 1714, who had a substantial formal garden constructed. The name Belsize Park comes from the 17th-century manor house and parkland (built by Daniel O'Neill for his wife, the Countess of Chesterfield) which once stood on the site. Rebuilt in 1663, it was sublet by 1721, when the parklands opened as pleasure gardens for those looking to escape the dirt and grim of the City of London, with concerts, singing dancing and country sports such as fishing and racing. In 1722 magistrates were instructed to act to stop riotous behaviour, although the parkland remained open until 1745. Belsize House was rebuilt in 1746, after which additional large country houses had been built on the surrounding farmlands for wealthy lawyers and merchants. Between 1679 and 1714, the number of houses on the estate had increased from 8 to 14, and by 1808 there were still only 22 recorded. However, the formal division of the state in 1808 into eight separate lands - based on the structure of the underleases pertaining to the estates formal houses - allowed the church to maximise its income, and hence to allow additional substantial houses to be built on the lands. This income allowed the church to have Belsize House rebuilt in 1812 for additional letting income. The wealthy leaseholders soon enabled themselves to purchase the freehold from the church, allowing the accelerated development of Belsize as a Victorian country urban suburb of London. One of the new land owners George Todd redeveloped what was known as the White House in 1815 as a substantial Georgian stucco-villa with portico, and two lodges. Known as Belsize House, it was later sold to Matthew Forster (1786 ‚Äì 1869) the Whig MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed as Belsize Lodge - it was demolished in 1937. Victorian development started along the main London to Hampstead road from 1815 through the works of Edward Bliss, a self-made man who had leased and then bought the southeastern-located Newman's House lands, on the west side of Haverstock Hill north of England's Lane. Bliss not only built properties to lease out, but also allowed construction subleases. In 1829 Eton College advertised villa- sized plots on Haverstock Hill. The college then started developing an axis road to Finchley Road, naming it after Queen Adelaide. Development halted in the 1830s due to the proposal for the lines of the London and Birmingham Railway (L&BR;) to be built through Belsize Park, but Eton College successfully argued via Parliamentary lobbying for the railway to be tunnelled underground via Primrose Hill, which was then designed and engineered by Eugenius Birch. All the 38 houses on the Newman's House lands had been built by 1830. The passing of the Ecclesiastical Leases Act 1842 allowed all church lands to be let on long term construction leases, which unlocked the accelerated urban development of Belsize Park. The opening in 1851 of Hampstead Road railway station on the L&BR; prompted William Lund in 1852 to agree a 99-year construction sublease on the former Forsyth estate. He proposed developments to the west of Haverstock Hill, although his plans were curtailed by construction issues associated with building over both the Pond Street sewer and the L&BR; tunnel. In 1852 Charles James Palmer, a Bloomsbury- based solicitor bought the lease of Belsize House. In 1853 he proposed demolition of the main house, with Daniel Tiley taking the lead role in constructing Belsize Square and associated properties. Palmer commissioned architect James Piers St Aubyn to design St Peter's Church. In 1864 the church bought-back the lease on the undeveloped backlot of the Bliss lands. Tiley gained agreement from Palmer and Eton College to buy the construction lease from the church, and hence extend development south of Belsize Square to connect with the college's estate. Mimicking the then fashionable styles of Kensington and Bayswater, between 1851 and the late 1860s he built over 250 8-10 bedroom semi-detached stucco houses with large porticos, aimed at the middle classes. The church undertook a similar agreement in 1857, reacquiring full control over the portion of Todd's lease north of Belsize Lane in 1865, and again selling it to Tiley. With construction almost complete, fashion changed and Tiley went bankrupt in 1870. Of the original eight lands defined by the church in 1808, the three leased to Thomas Roberts remained substantially undeveloped throughout much of the Victoria era. South End Farm continued as a farmhouse, whilst although Rosslyn House was sold in 1816 to the undertenant, it remained in place with its formal gardens until the house was demolished between 1896 and 1909. In 1855 Henry Davidson exchanged his lease for life of the Rosslyn House lands for a 99-year building lease. Due to issues associated with construction over the L&BR; tunnels, in 1859 he sold Rosslyn House and it extended formal gardens to Charles Henry Lardner Woodd. Woodd decided to sublease the house out for income, with its occupiers until 1893 including Sir Francis Freeling (1764 ‚Äì 1836) who was Secretary of HM General Post Office, and General Sir Moore Disney. Davidson developed his part of the Rosslyn lands, undertaking a mixed development of large semi-detached properties similar to Belsize Park, slowed by a lack of labour through both the substantial development of the neighbouring Maryon Wilson land and the 1860s housing rush. Victorian houses in Belsize Park Gardens Developing housing resulted in the need for facilities, including the Metropolitan Railway from 1860 (Hampstead Heath and Finchley Road), and the L&BR; form 1868 (Swiss Cottage and Finchley Road). From 1873 William Willett - the father of William Willett the tireless promoter of British Summer Time, who helped his father from 1881 onwards - took over the church's leases after the bankruptcy of Daniel Tiley. Willett redeveloped much of the former Eton College estate with newer, smaller but still substantial properties inspired by Queen Anne style architecture. By 1900, most of the residual country mansions and their gardens had been demolished, now to make way for smaller terraced houses. Belsize Park Mews After World War I, the construction of blocks of flats began, and now a great many of the larger houses are also converted into flats. In World War II, a large underground air-raid shelter was built here and its entrance can still be seen near the tube station at Downside Crescent. The area on Haverstock Hill north of Belsize Park Underground station up to Hampstead Town Hall and including part of a primary school near the Royal Free Hospital was heavily bombed. When the area was rebuilt, the opportunity was taken to widen the pavement and build further back from the road. Transport The nearest stations are: *Belsize Park (Northern line) *Chalk Farm (Northern line) *Swiss Cottage (Jubilee line) *Hampstead Heath (London Overground) Cultural references The lyrics of the international chart hit \\"Kayleigh\\" by rock band Marillion in 1985 include the line \\"loving on the floor in Belsize Park\\". It is also in the short film Les Bicyclettes de Belsize (although mainly filmed in Hampstead Village), of which the title song was covered by Mireille Mathieu, Engelbert Humperdinck, and others. Belsize Park is also referenced on Sleeper's 1995 debut album Smart in the song \\"Lady Love Your Countryside\\" with the lyrics \\"And we could spend our lives puking in Belsize Park\\". Cozy Powell's 1974 single \\"Na Na Na\\" suggests that \\"You're a wizard of Wembley Central, You're the J. S. Bach of Belsize park\\". The Camden Town Group artist Robert Polhill Bevan and his wife Stanislawa de Karlowska lived at 14 Adamson Road from 1900 to 1925. Kirsty MacColl's 2000 song \\"England 2 Columbia 0\\" features the line, \\"we went to a pub in Belsize Park and cheered on England as the skies grew dark...\\" It is also the place of residence for the Jewish community targeted by Hitler during the Second World War in the novel The Morning Gift. Novelist Peter Straub entitled his 1983 poetry collection \\"Leeson Square and Belsize Park\\" in part after his time in residence in the Belsize Park region of London. Belsize Park and the surrounding quarters were the setting for a long-running radio drama, Waggoner's Walk. This daily serial ran from April 1969 to May 1980 each weekday on Radio 2. Belsize Park is mentioned in the Hitchcock thriller, Dial M for Murder (1954) by the lead character Tony Wallace played by Ray Milland when coercing his accomplice, C.A. Swann into murdering his wife. Belsize Village was recently (2014) the setting for a Direct Line Insurance advert featuring Harvey Keitel. Sport There are records of a Belsize Park Rugby Club in North-West London since the 1860s. In 1871, Belsize was one of the clubs at the inaugural meeting of the Rugby Football Union, and therefore pioneers of the game of Rugby Union. In 1878, Belsize moved to form Rosslyn Park RFC, becoming one of England's leading clubs. In 1971, Belsize Park RFC was re-established by a group of local players. The club is now one of the most central of all London Rugby Clubs, playing and training in Regent's Park. There are five regular teams playing every Saturday during the season as well as a touch rugby squad in the summer time.

The game was released on January 14, 2003 in North America and April 17, 2003 in Europe. It was later released in Japan on March 25, 2004. The game is set in the aftermath of an alien invasion of Earth where their hazardous fuels have spawned giant monsters that battle one another in city environments. The game pays homage to kaiju films and 1950s science fiction films. Gameplay Monsters battle in a city environment. In War of the Monsters, players take the roles of large monsters in city environments. The game plays as a fighting game yet works differently from the traditional one-on-one structured rounds. Instead, fights can include up to 4 players in a four-way simultaneous fighting structure. The camera is in third person perspective, allowing the player to focus solely on their character. Monsters have two status bars in each game, health and stamina. Like the standard fighting game formula, every time a monster takes damage, their overall Health bar drops until it is completely depleted, resulting in player defeat. Stamina determines how much energy a monster can attack with. The bar drops if a monster picks up another foe or performs a ranged attack. If the bar is full, a monster can perform special attacks, whereas if the bar is completely drained, they become temporarily unable to use basic attacks (they can still throw and attack with items however, which adds energy to the bar and helps an empty bar recover faster). Also unlike most fighting games, players are allowed to roam freely within the city area, which allows climbing of jumping from buildings and cliffs. Monsters can use the environment to deal out damage to their foes by making weapons of various objects found within the city, such as vehicles and rubble as projectiles, steel girders and stone columns as clubs and radio antennae as a spear to impale others, temporarily stunning them. There are also some environment pick-ups, which can increase health or stamina, appearing as green or blue orbs and floating radioactive signs. Buildings can be destroyed if a monster directly attacks or is thrown into it. In some cities, taller buildings can topple over sideways that can crush other monsters, killing them instantly. In the Adventure mode, along with a series of set fights with other monsters, boss battles are also present. They are much larger than the standard playable monsters and required certain strategies to defeat. \\"Tokens\\" can also be earned through Adventure mode, which can be spent at the \\"Unlocks\\" shop to unlock more cities, monsters, and monster skins. And you also can unlock mini-games like dodge ball or city destruction. Multiplayer options allow two players via split-screen, which can be set to merge into one screen when both players are close enough to fit on the same screen. Plot Each level of the game features a fictional movie poster that includes the game's monsters. The plot is set in the 1950s where a fleet of alien flying saucer warships invade the Earth, causing massive damage. The scientists of the world's nations manage to create a series of secret weapons, which, when activated, let loose shock waves that short- circuit the saucers and cause them to crash. Unfortunately, the flying saucers were all fueled by a green radioactive liquid, which leaked out as they crashed. Through this, the fuel infects creatures, humans, and robots, turning them into giant mutant monsters, creating a war for supremacy among them. The player acts as one of these monsters and battles against the rest in fictional cities across the globe and the remaining UFOs. The story mode of the game starts out in Midtown Park where a giant gorilla called Congar defeats a wave of military forces but is fought and defeated by the lead monster. In Gambler's Gulch, the lead monster also defeats the reptilian beast, Togera. After Togera's defeat, a military class mech called Robo-47 and the military show up and attack the lead monster but are defeated as well. At a military base at Rosedale Canyon, the lead monster is confronted by a horde of irradiated giant ants and a mega robot, Goliath Prime. Prime and the ants are all defeated. In Metro City, the military decide to test their new weapon, Mecha-Congar, on the giant mantis Preytor, who was attacking the city. Before they could fight the lead monster appears and defeats them both. The lead monster then travels to Century Airfield and defeats twin Raptros dragons. Then, at the Atomic Island power plant, the lead monster defeats a swarm of Kineticlops, living electrical monsters, by causing a nuclear meltdown. In the resulting ruins, the lead monster must battle a large, three headed plant creature called Vegon. Two Robo-47s stop a UFO attack in scenic Baytown and then try to slay the lead monster. Both are repelled and beaten. In the Pacific island of Club Caldera, the rock monsters Magmo and Agamo fight each other with the lead monster caught in the middle. Both are beaten. After defeating two Ultra V robots at \\"Tsunopolis\\", the lead monster is abducted by a UFO that takes it back to the mothership. There the lead monster has to fend off three Zorgulons before being abducted once more when the mothership explodes, causing the UFO to crash into the North American city of Capitol. There, the alien leader Cerebulon attacks in a multi-layered tripod battle suit. After Cerebulon is defeated, the lead monster victor watches as the last part of Cerebulon, a small timid insect like creature flees. A short movie is shown about the monster's origin depending on who the player chooses. The only exceptions are Raptros the dragon and Zorgulon the alien creature who has their own ending with roar in victory. Reception War of the Monsters received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of three sevens and one six for a total of 27 out of 40. Most reviewers praised the game's style and monster roster, being a homage to classic monster movies. IGN stated that \\"the game draws its inspiration from movies like The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms, King Kong, and Godzilla, the characters immediately appear to be Inspired by from the great Ray Harryhausen\\", going on to say \\"each of the game's 10 gigantic beasts are as fun to play as they are to look at\\" while GameSpot said \\"a slick presentation gives the game the style of an old drive- in movie or news telecast, and it really works well to accentuate the game's retro theme and characters.\\" GameSpy was equally impressed, noting the destructible environments, that \\"WotM captures the joy of destruction more so than any game I've ever played. Did you think knocking over buildings was fun in Rampage? It's ten... no, twelvety times better in WotM\\". Game Informer, however, complained about certain aspects of gameplay, that \\"the unblockable attacks are just downright unfair\\" and that \\"the lazy camera produces numerous blind spots throughout a battle\\". Game Revolution noted AI issues, that \\"the monsters routinely demonstrate a strong sense of self-preservation\\", which they called \\"extremely frustrating behavior\\".

It is one of the few remaining ground-level creeks in New York City. Geography Southern part of the Lemon Creek Park Lemon Creek emerges from a conduit under Rossville Avenue and flows into Porzio's Pond, located north of the intersection of Woodrow Road and Maguire Avenue. Water from the pond reaches Lemon Creek both above ground and underground. Flowing generally southward, near the intersection of Drumgoole Road West and Maguire Avenue, Sandy Brook empties into the creek. This small stream now originates just south of Sharrotts Road and east of the West Shore Expressway. Lemon Creek continues southward under the Korean War Veterans Parkway and Drumgoole Roads, and begins to widen among marshes south of the Staten Island Railway. The creek turns eastward and passes under Bayview Avenue, then southward again. Just above its mouth, it receives a tributary from the east draining Wolfe's Pond, which is located within a city park of the same name. A marina and boat moorings are located here. Immediately below, it empties into Prince's Bay, part of Raritan Bay, just off the corner of Bayview Avenue and Johnston Terrace. Throughout its above-ground length, Lemon Creek is generally regarded as the boundary between the neighborhoods of Prince's Bay and Pleasant Plains on Staten Island's South Shore. Its watershed covers about and lies within the terminal moraine crossing Staten Island. The lower reaches of the creek, below the Staten Island Railway, are bordered by extensive marshes, the largest and most pristine on the south shore of Staten Island. This area includes both salt marsh and the only tidal freshwater marsh on Staten Island. =Parks= Much of the creek below Hylan Boulevard, and a long strip of shoreline to the west, is part of the 105.77 acre (42.80 ha) Lemon Creek Park, established in 1962. The park includes the Seguine Mansion. The northern, wooded portion of the park forms the 15.99 acre (6.47 ha) Lemon Creek Park Preserve. Wolfe's Pond and its source, Wolfe Brook, comprise the 341.33 acre (138.13 ha) Wolfe's Pond Park. The upper reaches of Lemon Creek, and most of Sandy Brook flow through Bloomingdale Park, 138.67 acres (56.12 ha). History The creek first appears in recorded history in 1670, as one of the boundaries of a 140-acre (56.7 ha) grant of land to Paulus Regrenier. The Abraham Manee Homestead may encompass Regrenier's original dwelling. Clams were once abundant at the mouth of the creek, in Prince's Bay. The oysters harvested there were once a delicacy exported to London, and the export of oysters helped make the fortune of the local Seguine family. However, shellfishing ceased in the area in the 1920s due to an outbreak of typhoid fever traced to Raritan Bay oysters. However, while non-commercial clamming is still forbidden due to pollution, commercial clamming is permitted if the clams are transplanted into clean water before harvest, and the Lemon Creek marina is again a base for clamming vessels. Birdhouses constructed as a purple martin colony, inhabited by starlings in the winter. Known in 1830 as Seguine's Creek for the Seguine family, this body of water was referred to as the Little North River by 1895. Shortly thereafter, it began to be called Lemon Creek, although the origin of the name is not known. Fauna The marshes along the lower creek provide a home for waterfowl such as swans, mallards, and black ducks, and a refuge for migrating birds, as well as monarch butterflies. Lemon Creek Park is also home to the only purple martin colony in New York City, popular among local birdwatchers. In the center of the marshes on the lower creek is Ziel's Island, also known as Crab Island for the fiddler crabs and blue crabs that live there. Clams are commercially harvested off the mouth of the creek, and various marine fish can be caught from a fishing pier at the mouth of the creek.

It is not fully intelligible with the rest of Armenian. It was not a written language until 1995, when linguist Bert Vaux designed an orthographic system for it based on the Turkish alphabet; the Armenian alphabet was used by Christian immigrants from Hamshen (Northern Hamshenis)‚Äîwho refer to the language as Homshetsma (’Ä’∏’¥’∑’•÷Å’¥’°) in Russia and Abkhazia. Homshetsi is a spoken language amongst the Eastern Hemshinli, also known as the Hopa Hemshinli, who live in a small number of villages in Turkey's Artvin Province and Central Asia. The Western or Rize Hamsheni are a related, geographically separate group living in Rize Province, who spoke Homshetsi until sometime in the 19th century.

Because of its extended isolation, Homshetsi contains many archaisms that set it apart from all other Armenian dialects. The language preserves forms found only in Classical and Middle Armenian, and at the same time preserves foreign (especially Arab and Turkish) grammatical and lexical components that were stripped from modern Armenian during the twentieth century. \\"Homshetsma therefore gives us one of our only glimpses of Armenian in its 'pure' form, untainted by loanwords from Classical Armenian and not stripped of the Turkish component of its lexicon\\", writes Bert Vaux., page 257 UNESCO has categorised Homshetsi as a language that is \\"definitely endangered\\".United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), \\"Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger\\", February 2009.

Samuel & Nathaniel Buck, UK Government Art Collection, GAC 6483 Powderham Castle is a fortified manor house situated within the parish and former manor of Powderham, within the former hundred of Exminster, Devon, about south of the city of Exeter and mile (0.4 km) north-east of the village of Kenton, where the main public entrance gates are located.There is also an unrelated Powderham Castle (a 12th-century earth and timber ringwork fortress) near Crondall, Farnham. It is a Grade I listed building. The park and gardens are Grade II* listed in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. It is situated on flat, formerly marshy ground on the west bank of the River Exe estuary where it is joined by its tributary the River Kenn. On the opposite side of the Exe is the small village of Lympstone. The castle was expanded and altered extensively in the 18th and 19th centuries, most notably by James Wyatt in the 1790s. The castle remains the seat of the Courtenay family, Earls of Devon. Origin of the name The manor of Powderham is named from the ancient Dutch word polder, and means \\"the hamlet of the reclaimed marsh-land\\". History Powderham Castle, east front, viewed from the deer park Powderham Castle, Devon, east (garden) front. The wing projecting forwards at the right contains the second library, built 1766‚Äì69. The central tower and flanking single-height bow- windows date from 1710‚Äì27. The tower in the corner-angle to the right and the main full-height range behind date from 1390‚Äì1450. At some time after 1390 the medieval core of the present structure was built by Sir Philip Courtenay (d. 1406), the 5th or 6th son of Hugh Courtenay, 2nd Earl of Devon (d. 1377). The Earls of Devon were seated at Tiverton Castle until 1556, and their cousins of this cadet line known as \\"Courtenay of Powderham\\" continued to exist in parallel, not always on amicable terms, as prominent county gentry, arguably the leading and most prestigious gentry family of Devon, actively engaged in the local administration of Devon as JP's, sheriffs and MP's. From 1556 on the extinction of the senior line of Courtenay of Tiverton, the Courtenays of Powderham had become retrospectively, as was decided by law in 1831, de jure Earls of Devon, and became de facto Earls from 1831 when the title was confirmed to them in law. They had however shortly before obtained the right to sit in the House of Lords when created Viscounts. The original building on the site was a fortified manor house, the appellation \\"castle\\" was added probably no earlier than the 17th century. The building has never been a true castle, that is to say with a keep and moat, although it did possess a curtain wall and yard on the east side (now the rose garden) as shown in the 1745 engraving by Buck. Leland mentioned a barbican or bulwark in this area, but these were demolished as part of the 18th-century landscaping works designed to provide an uninterrupted view from the lower rooms towards the Exe Estuary.Pevsner, p. 692. Many castle-like elements on the west front (main entrance) were added in the 19th century. The gatehouse was built between 1845‚Äì47 to a design by Charles Fowler. The tall rectangular structure beyond with a tower to the north is essentially the original fortified manor house. The projection from the lower storey to the north in lighter stone with three Gothic-style windows is the Victorian dining hall, designed by Fowler. =Wars of the Roses= During the Wars of the Roses the enemies of the Courtenay Earls of Devon of Tiverton Castle were the Bonville family of Shute. Their distant cousin at Powderham, Sir William Courtenay (d. 1485) married Margaret Bonville, daughter of William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville (1392‚Äì1461), which confirmed Powderham as a Bonville stronghold against the Earls of Devon. On 3 November 1455 Thomas de Courtenay, 5th Earl of Devon (1414‚Äì1458), at the head of a private army of 1,000 men, seized control of Exeter and its castle and laid siege to Powderham for two months. Lord Bonville attempted to raise the siege and approached from the east, crossing the River Exe; he was unsuccessful and was driven back by the earl's forces. On 15 December 1455 the Earl of Devon and Lord Bonville met decisively at the First Battle of Clyst Heath in Exeter, where Bonville was defeated and after which the earl sacked and pillaged Shute.Orme, Nicholas, Representation & Rebellion in the Later Middle Ages, published in Kain, Roger & Ravenhill, William, (eds.) Historical Atlas of South-West England, Exeter, 1999, pp. 141, 144. =Civil War= During the Civil War Powderham Castle was garrisoned by 300 Royalist soldiers under the command of Sir Hugh Meredith. In December 1645 a Parliamentarian detachment under the command of Sir Thomas Fairfax tried, without initial success, to capture itMackenzie (1896), pp. 39‚Äì40. but it fell on 25 January 1646 to Col. Robert Hammond. The castle was badly damaged in the assault and remained, in places, open to the elements until the early 1700s when it was repaired by Sir William Courtenay, 2nd Baronet (d. 1735).French, p. 19. Description of interior Staircase Hall, Powderham Castle Music Room, Powderham Castle The house is centred on the 14th- and 15th-century thickly- walled double-height rectangular building formerly comprising from north to south the withdrawing room, great hall, screens passage and kitchens, which are now represented in the same orientation by the ante-room, staircase hall, marble hall and Victorian kitchen. =Marble hall= The marble hall, named from its black and white marble floor, was completed in 1755 and forms the lower and southern part of the former medieval great hall, which was divided by an internal wall in the early 18th century into staircase hall and marble hall. Originally it was double height, as high as the staircase hall to the north, before the ceiling was added in the 18th century to form bedrooms above. At the same time the staircase was inserted into the upper part to form the staircase hall. The screens passage was located in this end of the hall. The timber screen which formed the north side of the screens passage was demolished at the time of the partition, but three medieval Gothic-arched doorways through the south stone wall of the screens passage into the kitchen remain. A single more flatly arched doorway remains high up on the south wall, which formed the entrance to the wooden minstrels' gallery overhanging the great hall.Pevsner, p. 693. The marble hall is used as a sitting room which has an 18th-century fireplace. Contents of the room include a high longcase clock made about 1745 by William Stumbels of Totnes; a large 17th-century Brussels tapestry with rustic farm-yard scenery after Teniers above the fireplace; and a 1553 carved wooden over-mantel decorated with the Courtenay arms. Two portraits of the present Earl of Devon and his wife hang on the north wall above the wooden panelling. =Staircase Hall= The hall has an impressive mahogany staircase decorated with carved heraldic beasts and intricate plasterwork. =Music Room= The spectacular Music Room, designed by James Wyatt in 1788 for the flamboyant 3rd Viscount of Devon, has an Axminster carpet made in about 1798 by Thomas Whitty of the original Axminster Carpets Ltd.Jane Austen's World. Accessed 11 August 2014. =Other= The house has a mixture of medieval features and fine 18th-century decoration. Upstairs the original solar has a collection of toys. There is also a collection of paintings and family portraits by many notable artists. There is a narwhal tusk, sometimes said to be a unicorn horn able to detect poison. =Memorial chimneypiece in Dining Hall= The heraldic chimneypiece (c. 1860) in the Dining Hall William Courtenay, 11th Earl of Devon (d. 1888) installed a heraldic chimneypiece in the Dining Hall in memory of his grandfather Reginald Courtenay (1741‚Äì1803), Bishop of Exeter from 1797 to 1803, and of his parents. The Dining Hall was built by his father William Courtenay, 10th Earl of Devon (d. 1859) between 1847 and his death in 1859, and the 11th Earl completed the internal decorations in 1860, including the linen fold panelling containing several dozen ancestral heraldic shields.Powderham Castle guidebook, 2011, p. 10. It is copied from the mediaeval chimneypiece in the Bishop's Palace, Exeter, installed c. 1485 by Peter Courtenay (d. 1492) Bishop of Exeter, a younger son of Sir Philip Courtenay (1404‚Äì1463) of Powderham.Pevsner, N.

Modern times Powderham Castle and Rose Garden from the south-east, an identical view to which was engraved by Samuel Buck in 1745 Since 1745 the second library has extended the chapel wing, the two low rooms either side of the clock tower have been converted to bow-window fronts, and the castellated gatehouse tower, which might have blocked this view, has been demolished. In addition, the harbour on the River Kenn, which here flows into the River Exe, has been altered by landscaping. Powderham Castle has been a Grade I listed building since 1952, and recognised as an internationally important structure. The staircase, hall, music room and master bedroom of the house were used as locations for the 1993 film The Remains of the Day. The house was also used as a setting for a recent film comedy, Churchill: The Hollywood Years. The castle's licence to host wedding ceremonies was revoked with effect from 1 January 2009 after Hugh Courtenay, 18th Earl of Devon, refused a gay couple use of the building to hold their civil partnership ceremony because it did not fit with his religious beliefs. On 29 September 2009, the Earl auctioned 113 treasures from the castle, at Sotheby's in London, in order to cover debts accrued in running the 14th-century home. The sale of family silver, furniture, antiques and paintings made a total of ¬£1,013,638. He denied that the auction was prompted by the loss of revenue from weddings. Subsequently, the Earl handed control of the estate to his son, Charles, Lord Courtenay, now the 19th Earl of Devon. The licence to host weddings, civil ceremonies and civil partnerships at the Castle has now been reinstated. In 2017 Mary Berry visited and filmed an hour long programme as part of her 4 part series, Mary Berry's Country House Secrets, broadcast on BBC One. Powderham Castle features as the photographic location of the rebranding of the Historic Houses Association in 2018. In 2018 the Castle opened up new rooms, and previous private family only areas as part of two new guided tours, the first time the tours have been altered since opening in the 1950s. =Concerts= On 2 August 2004, Irish vocal pop band Westlife held a concert for their Turnaround Tour supporting their album Turnaround. Rock band Status Quo played a concert at Powderham Castle in 2003, in support of their Riffs album. The band played there again in 2009, alongside other performers including ABC, Go West, Kid Creole and the Coconuts, Howard Jones, Nik Kershaw, Cutting Crew, Doctor and the Medics, Altered Images and Marc Almond. Powderham Castle hosted BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend in May 2016, featuring Ellie Goulding, Coldplay, The 1975, Craig David, Nick Jonas, and Iggy Azalea. Since the Big Weekend, Powderham has hosted concerts by artists such as Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds, Little Mix, Bryan Adams and Tom Jones.  In popular culture  In 1924 the Great Western Railway named a 4-6-0 'Castle class' locomotive \\"Powderham Castle\\"; the main GWR line from Exeter to Plymouth runs alongside the castle grounds and passengers can see the castle from the train as they pass.

It has been argued to be both an extension of, and the principle underlying, the right to freedom of thought. Though a relatively recently defined concept, many theorists see cognitive liberty as being of increasing importance as technological advances in neuroscience allow for an ever-expanding ability to directly influence consciousness. Cognitive liberty is not a recognized right in any international human rights treaties, but has gained a limited level of recognition in the United States, and is argued to be the principle underlying a number of recognized rights.Bublitz and Merkel, 60-1 Overview The term \\"cognitive liberty\\" was coined by neuroethicist Dr. Wrye Sententia and legal theorist and lawyer Richard Glen Boire, the founders and directors of the non-profit Center for Cognitive Liberty and Ethics (CCLE). Sententia and Boire define cognitive liberty as \\"the right of each individual to think independently and autonomously, to use the full power of his or her mind, and to engage in multiple modes of thought.\\" Sententia and Boire conceived of the concept of cognitive liberty as a response to the increasing ability of technology to monitor and manipulate cognitive function, and the corresponding increase in the need to ensure individual cognitive autonomy and privacy.Sententia (2004), 223 Sententia divides the practical application of cognitive liberty into two principles: #As long as their behavior does not endanger others, individuals should not be compelled against their will to use technologies that directly interact with the brain or be forced to take certain psychoactive drugs. #As long as they do not subsequently engage in behavior that harms others, individuals should not be prohibited from, or criminalized for, using new mind-enhancing drugs and technologies.Sententia (2004), 227 These two facets of cognitive liberty are reminiscent of Timothy Leary's \\"Two Commandments for the Molecular Age\\", from his 1968 book The Politics of Ecstasy: Supporters of cognitive liberty therefore seek to impose both a negative and a positive obligation on states: to refrain from non-consensually interfering with an individual's cognitive processes, and to allow individuals to self-determine their own \\"inner realm\\" and control their own mental functions.Bublitz and Merkel, 60 =Freedom from interference= This first obligation, to refrain from non-consensually interfering with an individual's cognitive processes, seeks to protect individuals from having their mental processes altered or monitored without their consent or knowledge, \\"setting up a defensive wall against unwanted intrusions\\".Bublitz and Merkel, 60 Ongoing improvements to neurotechnologies such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (or \\"brain fingerprinting\\"); and to pharmacology in the form of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), Nootropics, Modafinil and other psychoactive drugs, are continuing to increase the ability to both monitor and directly influence human cognition.Sententia (2004), 223-224 As a result, many theorists have emphasized the importance of recognizing cognitive liberty in order to protect individuals from the state using such technologies to alter those individuals‚Äô mental processes: \\"states must be barred from invading the inner sphere of persons, from accessing their thoughts, modulating their emotions or manipulating their personal preferences.\\"Bublitz and Merkel, 61 These specific ethical concerns regarding the use of neuroscience technologies to interfere or invade the brain form the fields of neuroethics and neuroprivacy. This element of cognitive liberty has been raised in relation to a number of state-sanctioned interventions in individual cognition, from the mandatory psychiatric 'treatment' of homosexuals in the US before the 1970s, to the non-consensual administration of psychoactive drugs to unwitting US citizens during CIA Project MKUltra, to the forcible administration of mind- altering drugs on individuals to make them competent to stand trial.Boire, Richard Glen, (2002). Brief Amicus Curiae Of The Center For Cognitive Liberty & Ethics In Support Of The Petition , in the case of Sell v United States Futurist and bioethicist George Dvorsky, Chair of the Board of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies has identified this element of cognitive liberty as being of relevance to the debate around the curing of autism spectrum conditions. Duke University School of Law Professor Nita A. Farahany has also proposed legislative protection of cognitive liberty as a way of safeguarding the protection from self-incrimination found in the Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution, in the light of the increasing ability to access human memory. Though this element of cognitive liberty is often defined as an individual's freedom from state interference with human cognition, Jan Christoph Bublitz and Reinhard Merkel among others suggest that cognitive liberty should also prevent other, non-state entities from interfering with an individual's mental \\"inner realm\\".Boire, Part IBublitz and Merkel, 68 Bublitz and Merkel propose the introduction of a new criminal offense punishing \\"interventions severely interfering with another‚Äôs mental integrity by undermining mental control or exploiting pre-existing mental weakness.\\"Bublitz and Merkel, 68 Direct interventions that reduce or impair cognitive capacities such as memory, concentration, and willpower; alter preferences, beliefs, or behavioral dispositions; elicit inappropriate emotions; or inflict clinically identifiable mental injuries would all be prima facie impermissible and subject to criminal prosecution.Bublitz and Merkel, 68-70 Sententia and Boire have also expressed concern that corporations and other non-state entities might utilize emerging neurotechnologies to alter individuals' mental processes without their consent.Sententia (2004), 223Boire, Part I =Freedom to self-determine= Where the first obligation seeks to protect individuals from interference with cognitive processes by the state, corporations or other individuals, this second obligation seeks to ensure that individuals have the freedom to alter or enhance their own consciousness.Boire, Part I An individual who enjoys this aspect of cognitive liberty has the freedom to alter their mental processes in any way they wish to; whether through indirect methods such as meditation, yoga or prayer; or through direct cognitive intervention through psychoactive drugs or neurotechnology. As psychotropic drugs are a powerful method of altering cognitive function, many advocates of cognitive liberty are also advocates of drug law reform; claiming that the \\"war on drugs\\" is in fact a \\"war on mental states\\". The CCLE, as well as other cognitive liberty advocacy groups such as Cognitive Liberty UK, have lobbied for the re-examination and reform of prohibited drug law; one of the CCLE's key guiding principles is that: \\"governments should not criminally prohibit cognitive enhancement or the experience of any mental state\\". Calls for reform of restrictions on the use of prescription cognitive-enhancement drugs (also called smart drugs or nootropics) such as Prozac, Ritalin and Adderall have also been made on the grounds of cognitive liberty.Blitz, 1058-1060 This element of cognitive liberty is also of great importance to proponents of the transhumanist movement, a key tenet of which is the enhancement of human mental function. Dr Wrye Sententia has emphasized the importance of cognitive liberty in ensuring the freedom to pursue human mental enhancement, as well as the freedom to choose against enhancement.Sententia (2013), 356 Sententia argues that the recognition of a \\"right to (and not to) direct, modify, or enhance one's thought processes\\" is vital to the free application of emerging neurotechnology to enhance human cognition; and that something beyond the current conception of freedom of thought is needed.Sententia (2013), 355-6 Sententia claims that \\"cognitive liberty's strength is that it protects those who do want to alter their brains, but also those who do not\\".Sententia (2013), 356 Relationship with recognized human rights Cognitive liberty is not currently recognized as a human right by any international human rights treaty.Bublitz and Merkel, 60 While freedom of thought is recognized by Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), freedom of thought can be distinguished from cognitive liberty in that the former is concerned with protecting an individual's freedom to think whatever they want, whereas cognitive liberty is concerned with protecting an individual's freedom to think however they want.Bublitz and Merkel, 64 Cognitive liberty seeks to protect an individual's right to determine their own state of mind and be free from external control over their state of mind, rather than just protecting the content of an individuals‚Äô thoughts.Boire, Part II It has been suggested that the lack of protection of cognitive liberty in previous human rights instruments was due to the relative lack of technology capable of directly interfering with mental autonomy at the time the core human rights treaties were created.Boire, Part I As the human mind was considered invulnerable to direct manipulation, control or alteration, it was deemed unnecessary to expressly protect individuals from unwanted mental interference.Bublitz and Merkel, 61 With modern advances in neuroscience and in anticipation of its future development however, it is argued that such express protection is becoming increasingly necessary.Walsh 433 Cognitive liberty then can be seen as an extension of or an \\"update\\" to the right to freedom of thought as it has been traditionally understood.Sententia (2013), 356 Freedom of thought should now be understood to include the right to determine one's own mental state as well as the content of one's thoughts. However, some have instead argued that cognitive liberty is already an inherent part of the international human rights framework as the principle underlying the rights to freedom of thought, expression and religion.Bublitz and Merkel, 63 The freedom to think in whatever manner one chooses is a \\"necessary precondition to those guaranteed freedoms.\\"Boire, Part II Daniel Waterman and Casey William Hardison have argued that cognitive liberty is fundamental to Freedom of Thought because it encompasses the ability to have certain types of experiences, including the right to experience altered or non-ordinary states of consciousness.Waterman, 345 It has also been suggested that cognitive liberty can be seen to be a part of the inherent dignity of human beings as recognized by Article 1 of the UDHR.Bublitz and Merkel, 63 Most proponents of cognitive liberty agree however that cognitive liberty should be expressly recognized as a human right in order to properly provide protection for individual cognitive autonomy.Boire, Part IFarahany, 405-6Sententia (2004), 226-7 Legal recognition =In the United States= Richard Glen Boire of the Center for Cognitive Liberty and Ethics filed an amicus brief with the US Supreme Court in the case of Sell v. United States, in which the Supreme Court examined whether the court had the power to make an order to forcibly administer antipsychotic medication to an individual who had refused such treatment, for the sole purpose of making them competent to stand trial.Boire, Richard Glen, (2002). \\"Brief Amicus Curiae Of The Center For Cognitive Liberty & Ethics In Support Of The Petition, in the case of Sell v United States\\" Sell v. United States 539 U.S. 166 (2003) =In the United Kingdom= In the case of R v Hardison, the defendant, charged with eight counts under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (MDA), including the production of DMT and LSD, claimed that cognitive liberty was safeguarded by Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights.R v Hardison [2007] 1 Cr App R (S) 37 Hardison argued that \\"individual sovereignty over one's interior environment constitutes the very core of what it means to be free\\", and that as psychotropic drugs are a potent method of altering an individual's mental process, prohibition of them under the MDA was in opposition to Article 9.Walsh, 433 The court however disagreed, calling Hardison's arguments a \\"portmanteau defense\\" and relying upon the UN Drug Conventions and the earlier case of R v Taylor to deny Hardison's right to appeal to a superior court.Walsh, 437 Hardison was convicted and given a 20-year prison sentence, though he was released on 29 May 2013 after nine years in prison.Walsh, 437 Criticism While there has been little publicized criticism of the concept of cognitive liberty itself, drug policy reform and the concept of human enhancement, both closely linked to cognitive liberty, remain highly controversial issues. The recent development of neurosciences is increasing the possibility of controlling and influence specific mental functions. The risks inherent in removing restrictions on controlled cognitive-enhancing drugs, including of widening the gap between those able to afford such treatments and those unable to do so, have caused many to remain skeptical about the wisdom of recognizing cognitive liberty as a right.Blitz, 1063 Political philosopher and Harvard University professor Michael J. Sandel, when examining the prospect of memory enhancement, wrote that \\"some who worry about the ethics of cognitive enhancement point to the danger of creating two classes of human beings ‚Äì those with access to enhancement technologies, and those who must make do with an unaltered memory that fades with age.\\" Cognitive liberty then faces opposition obliquely in these interrelated debates.

It was labeled 'a terrorist organization' by the Romanian government, though in Bulgaria it was regarded as a liberation movement. The organisation was founded in 1923 under the leadership of Docho Mihaylov and on the basis of the Great Convention of Dobruja (–í–µ–ª–∏–∫ –¥–æ–±—Ä—É–¥–∂–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏ —Å—ä–±–æ—Ä), a Bulgarian political organisation established in 1919 to fight against the transfer of Southern Dobruja to Romania. The IDRO detachments fought against the widespread brigandage in the region, as well as the Romanian administration in the region. Like the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation in Macedonia and the Internal Thracian Revolutionary Organisation in Thrace, IDRO demanded political autonomy of Dobruja under the mandate of the League of Nations raising the slogan for the establishment of ‚Äúautonomous Dobruja‚Äù under the supervision of the League of Nations and \\"Dobruja for the Dobrujans\\".

This wing militated for a Soviet Republic of Dobruja, which would either be part of a \\"Balkan Communist Federation\\" or to become a Republic of the Soviet Union. The division of IDRO significantly hampered the work of the organisation, although it continued its activity under different forms until 1940 when Southern Dobruja was restored to Bulgaria under the terms of the Treaty of Craiova.

Formed in 1993, they were popularly labelled as a Britpop band and often drew comparisons to the Smiths because of their Morrissey-esque lead singer, Martin Rossiter. Gene's music was influenced by the Jam, the Smiths, the Style Council and the Clash. History =The Go Hole and Spin= Gene's origins lie in a previous band which was first called The Go Hole, named after a fictional \\"Beat\\" club in John Clellon Holmes' novel Go, and later renamed Sp!n when they became a four-piece. The band was formed by Lee Clark (vocals/guitar) and Daz Walton (bass). Soon afterwards, Matt James joined on drums with John Mason on bass. Their first single, recorded in the same studios as The Ruts' \\"In a Rut\\", appeared on their own Big Pop Records label. A John Peel session fuelled their early success, where they mixed with the Camberwell scene, mingling with members of The House of Love, My White Bedroom and Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer. Self-managed, apart from a couple of brushes with mini music moguls (in their own minds), John Mason would organise and negotiate much of the group's gigs, contracts and press especially later when they were a four-piece. After 18 months Clark, Mason and James invited John's brother Steve Mason to play lead/rhythm guitar and thereby free Clark to focus on vocals. Two singles, \\"Scratches (In the Sand)\\" and \\"Let's Pretend\\" were released in 1990 and 1991 respectively as an album had been recorded with Stephen Street as producer. Then, Sp!n were involved in a road accident. John Mason suffered a serious head injury and an 11-day coma. The day prior to the accident, Clark had offered his resignation in a letter to the rest of the band, due to his dissatisfaction with the way the band and its record label, Foundation, were guiding its course. A further EP, titled Hot Blood, was released in late 1991 and the album, titled In Motion, also came out. With headlines of road crashes and injuries, the public perception of a vibrant new band was hard to maintain. Change again was thrust upon them. John Mason, disappointed with the music business and his ideals of The Clash, Crass and independence overlooked for the limited vision of those caught up in legal wrangling, went on to become a writer. Clark briefly recorded demos with Andrew \\"Snake\\" Newton, who had been the live sound engineer for Spin, than gave up music to become a primary school teacher. Clark felt he was getting a bit old to be a rock star and decided to play and record only in his own bedroom and indeed returned to this after a hiatus of about ten years. Wanting to continue together in a band, Steve Mason and James recruited bass player Kevin Miles, who had a long association with the band. After seeing Watford- based Welshman Martin Rossiter cross the floor of a club, Mason approached him and they began to talk. Their meeting ended with Rossiter handing out his business card (\\"Martin Rossiter: Soothsayer to the Stars\\") and Mason asking Rossiter if he would like to audition with the band. Rossiter appeared on Spin's last demos as \\"Martin T. Falls\\" (a nod to the Mancunian band The Fall) shortly before the decision was made to adopt the name Gene. =Breakthrough= By the time NME journalists Keith Cameron and Roy Wilkinson encountered Gene, the band had already gained some live experience and written several songs. Cameron and Wilkinson were impressed enough to form independent record label Costermonger with the sole purpose of promoting Gene to a wider audience. Their double A-sided debut single \\"For The Dead\\" / \\"Child's Body\\" was released on Costermonger in May 1994. The single received a great deal of attention from the music press: Select named it \\"Single Of The Month\\", whilst NME made it their \\"Single of the Week\\". The limited edition of 1,994 copies sold out in two days. Numerous live shows followed but it was Gene's performance in support of Pulp at London's The Forum that revealed the band to be a real force to be reckoned with. \\"Gene have just played third on the bill and willed the crowd into treating them like headliners who are very, very big indeed\\", said NME. \\"He [Martin] has made people love him, and now he's loving every minute of it.\\" With Gene already developing a devotional fan-base, a new single was planned to consolidate their popularity. The second single, a triple A-side consisting of \\"Be My Light Be My Guide\\", \\"This Is Not My Crime\\" and \\"I Can't Help Myself\\" was released on 1 August 1994 via Costermonger. Melody Maker awarded \\"Be My Light Be My Guide\\" its \\"Single Of The Week\\". =Popular success= After achieving the top spot in the UK indie chart and number 54 in the UK Singles Chart, the band played their first UK headlining tour, that included a show at London's Paradise Club which sold out immediately, with 800 people in the venue. The plaudits had not gone unnoticed by the big record companies and Gene eventually signed a deal with Polydor Records. For many observers, this was to prove a turning point for the band. After a successful appearance at the Reading Festival, the band released their third single \\"Sleep Well Tonight\\", just prior to embarking on a large national tour, preceded by several sold-out French dates. Featuring strongly in both critics and readers end of year polls, Gene were the recipients of the inaugural NME Brat Award for 'Best New Act', and as such played at the sold out Brat Award ceremony at the London Astoria. They adorned the covers of both the NME and Melody Maker, who voted them their 'Brightest Hope' for 1995. Their fourth single, \\"Haunted By You\\", became the band's second Top 40 hit (reaching number 32), whilst their debut LP Olympian reached number 8 in the UK Albums Chart following a plethora of excellent reviews. The album also gained Gene their first silver disc, recording sales of over 70,000 in the UK alone, and when the final single from the album was released (\\"Olympian\\"), it went into the Top 20 of the UK Singles Chart. The summer and autumn of 1995 were spent touring the world, including a well-received performance at Glastonbury Festival, headlining Reading Festival, a tour of Japan and Europe and then a foray into the US. With Christmas looming, the band entered the studio again for pre-production on their new album, scheduled for release the following year. 1996 began with a remixed \\"For the Dead\\" which subsequently became Gene's biggest hit (peaking at number 14 in the Top 40), leading to their debut appearance on Top of the Pops. To See The Lights, an LP of rarities, live tracks, radio sessions and acoustic versions of singles, was released in January and reached the number 11 spot in the album chart. A national tour was undertaken during most of the same month, culminating in two sell-out London shows at Shepherds Bush Empire and the Astoria. In anticipation of their second studio LP, October 1996 saw the release of \\"Fighting Fit\\", an up-tempo rock song which reached number 22. The start of 1997 heralded the release of \\"We Could Be Kings\\", another epic rock song which again proved to be popular, reaching number 18. The LP Drawn to The Deep End (1997), takes its name from a \\"Fighting Fit\\" B-side, and it revealed a lavish production replete with strings, far more prominent guitar solos from Mason, and a rather warbling vocal affectation from Rossiter. The album showed some measure of musical development from the band, which was reflected by the inclusion of a keyboardist in their live shows (Grand Drive's Julian Wilson [1996-98, 2004], former Style Council keyboardist Mick Talbot [1999-2001], Marcus Brown [2001], and Angie Pollack [2003-2004]), and the fact that Rossiter was starting to master the art of singing live whilst playing the keyboard for some songs. Lyrically speaking, the dominating themes of the album were loneliness and deep yearning. Indeed, Rossiter was in the depths of depression during the making of the album and the songs resulting from this period remain some of the band's most powerful work. Drawn to the Deep End was another critical success, with Q magazine awarding it four stars. Like its predecessor, the album entered the top 10 of the album chart, and subsequent singles, \\"Where Are They Now?\\" and \\"Speak to Me Someone\\" both made the top 40, at 22 and 30 respectively. Arguably the defining moment of the band's career came in March 1997, when they played with a full orchestra to a sell-out audience at the Royal Albert Hall. Transmitted on Radio 1, the event was commemorated by the release of two live EPs in tandem with the last two singles from Drawn to the Deep End. They also played in Hong Kong that year as part of the festivities of the UK's ceding the island back into Chinese hands. By late 1997, Rossiter in particular had gained some press attention in his newfound status as a minor celebrity. He had already appeared as a guest on Never Mind the Buzzcocks and various articles speculated on his sexuality (much to Rossiter's bemusement. As he told Sorted magazine: \\"I've never hidden the fact that I've slept on both sides of the bed and people find that very odd that I was quite happy to say 'yeah, I'm bisexual and it doesn't really matter.\\") He also hit the headlines due to a war of words between Rossiter and comedian Paul Kaye which culminated in Rossiter headbutting Kaye in a nightclub. =Revelations and leaving Polydor= 1998 served as a fallow year for the band, used for writing new material as well as a few low-key shows and events such as Radio 1's Sound City. In fact, the most newsworthy article about Gene during that year was of Martin Rossiter's 'drastic' change in image. Gone were the suit jackets with white shirts and the floppy side-parted hair, in favour of the mod-like Fred Perry polo shirts, jeans and a very short haircut. The new look was to be reflective of the band's rockier forthcoming studio LP, Revelations. On their return from relative wilderness, it appeared that Gene had lost a lot of their prestige during their year out of the limelight, and were no longer the golden boys of the indie scene. First off the LP, released in February 1999, was a Jam-like political single called \\"As Good As it Gets\\", which entered the charts at number 23 to lukewarm reviews. Revelations was released that March to very mixed reviews; the NME awarded it 5/10, concluding that the album was \\"pretty thin on the ground\\". Revelations carries some political songs, such as the aforementioned \\"As Good As it Gets\\", \\"The British Disease\\" and \\"Mayday\\". Rossiter, who had an occasional political spot on BBC Radio Five Live, launched a vitriolic critique of New Labour's first term in office. The album charted disappointingly at number 23, and the second single from the album, \\"Fill Her Up\\", charted at number 37 that April. Despite a successful and comprehensive tour around the country, again selling out many venues, as well as making a successful appearance at the Reading Festival of that year, Gene and Polydor parted ways. The band felt somewhat undermined by their label's lack of support and failure to market the album adequately. As Rossiter explained: \\"Only when we got to Gretna Green did we realise that Polydor had disembarked at Crewe.\\" Whilst the band made the best of Revelations' raw, live sound during the album's promotion, as well as the fact that the recording of the album took less than a month to complete (the marketing literature said it was in order to best convey the energy apparent from their live shows), after the split they claimed that they could have made it a better album had they been given more time by their label. =Artistic freedom and Libertine= Despite the lack of the support of a major record label, Gene spent a good portion of 2000 touring the world, which climaxed in a sell-out tour of the US. One of their shows, at the Los Angeles venue Troubadour, was broadcast over the internet in what was then a record-breaking webcast, screened to at least 60,000 people worldwide. Only two months after the recording of that show, Gene released Rising for Sunset, a live album recorded from that Troubadour show. The webcast and album were promoted with a pioneering international internet-only campaign resulting in 40k units sold upon its universal release. As well as rehearsing the band's hits, they released two new tracks, \\"Rising For Sunset\\" and \\"Somewhere in the World\\"; promising songs that bode well for their next studio LP and marking a return to the romance of their more popular tracks. That album, entitled Libertine, was released in October 2001 on Gene's own label, 'Sub Rosa Records'. =Split= Despite further successful live shows in subsequent years including a set at the Morrissey-curated Royal Festival Hall Meltdown Festival in June 2004, Gene opted for an amicable split later that year. Gene's last live performance was on 16 December 2004 at the London Astoria. The band members have all continued to work in music. Roy Wilkinson went on to manage the band British Sea Power, while Snake Newton went on to mix an assortment of acts including Duran Duran, Sugababes, Pet Shop Boys and Snow Patrol. In the third week of January 2008, all four members of Gene briefly took to the stage again for their ex-manager Jerry Smith's 50th birthday party. They performed five songs at the 100 Club in London: \\"Be My Light, Be My Guide\\", \\"For The Dead\\", \\"Where Are They Now?\\", \\"London, Can You Wait?\\" and \\"Olympian\\". =Reissues= In January 2014, all four studio albums plus To See the Lights were reissued in double disc deluxe editions containing extra materials (demos, out-takes, radio versions and live). Drummer Matt James discussed the re-releases and the history of the band with UK music website The Mouth Magazine.

Historical dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia, Dimitar Bechev, Scarecrow Press, 2009, , p. 100.250pxrightthumbExcerpt from the statute of ITRO, 1923 (in Bulgarian) Statute of the Internal Thracian Revolutionary Organisation Chapter I. - Goal Art. 1. The Internal Thracian Revolutionary Organisation has the goal of uniting all the disgruntled elements in Thrace to the river Struma, regardless of their nationality, to win, through a revolution, a full political independence. Art. 2. The organisation is against any attempts and wishes for divisions and conquests of Thrace, from each ever state.'' The reason for the establishment of ITRO was the deplorable situation of the Thracian Bulgarians in Western Thrace after the transfer of the region from Bulgaria to Greece in May, 1920. After the catastrophic defeat suffered by the Greek army in Anatolia in 1922, a stream of Greek refugees poured into Greece and settled, for the most part, in Greek Macedonia and Western Thrace. In order to provide housing for the refugees, the Greek government interned tens of thousands of Bulgarians from Western Thrace on the Aegean Sea islands. These returned to their homes after an intervention of the League of Nations, only to find them occupied by Greek refugees from Asia Minor. The desperate situation forced the Bulgarians to resort to armed struggle. ITRO was formed under the leadership of Tane Nikolov - former band leader of the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (IMARO) and its detachments started to launch attacks on the Greek garrisons in the region. The organisation acted in co- operation with the representatives of the Muslims (Turks) in Western Thrace raising the slogan for the establishment of ‚Äúindependent Thrace‚Äù under the supervision of the League of Nations and \\"Thrace for the Thracians\\". Tane Nikolov with other voivodas as leader of Internal Thracian Revolutionary Organization (1922). At the end of 1922, the Greek government started to expel large numbers of Bulgarians into Bulgaria and the activity of ITRO grew into an open rebellion. The organisation eventually gained full control of some districts along the Bulgarian border. In the summer of 1923, however, the Turks withdrew from the co-operation after the Treaty of Lausanne had guaranteed their rights. By that time, the majority of the Bulgarians had already been resettled to Bulgaria. In the same year the organization was banned by the Bulgarian government and Tane Nikolov disbanded it. However it was reestablished in the same year by the voivoda Dimitar Madzharov. Although detachments of the ITRO continued to infiltrate Western Thrace sporadically, the main focus of the activity of the organisation now shifted to the protection of the refugees into Bulgaria. The organisation became a state within the state in the districts of Haskovo and Kurdzhali where the majority of the refugees were concentrated, aiding their settlement and collecting taxes from tobacco merchants. As the activity of the organisation started to cause international problems for the Bulgarian government, ITRO was again formally disbanded in 1927, to be right away re-assembled under the name of Committee for Free Thrace (bulg. –ö–æ–º–∏—Ç–µ—Ç –∑–∞ —Å–≤–æ–±–æ–¥–Ω–∞ –¢—Ä–∞–∫–∏—è). The committee existed until 1934 when it was finally disbanded by the government of Kimon Georgiev.

The Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee () or BRCC was a Bulgarian revolutionary organisation founded in 1869 among the Bulgarian emigrant circles in Romania. The decisive influence for the establishment of the committee was exerted by the Svoboda newspaper which Lyuben Karavelov began to publish in the autumn of 1869. Some of the other revolutionaries who took active part in the formation and work of the BRCK were Panayot Hitov, Vasil Levski and Dimitar Tsenovich. Karavelov was elected chairman of the BRCK in the spring of 1870. He also prepared the first programme of the organisation (promulgated in Geneva on 1 August 1870), which envisaged the liberation of Bulgaria through a nationwide revolution and the establishment of a democratic republic. By the end of 1871, both Karavelov and Vasil Levski, the leader of the other Bulgarian revolutionary society‚Äìthe Internal Revolutionary Organisation‚Äìknew that the future success of the armed struggle against the Ottomans depended on the co- operation of both emigration and local committees. To this end, the two organisations prepared and adopted a joint programme and charter and voted on the merger of the two organisations under the name of BRCK at a general meeting held in Bucharest in May 1872. The charter of the joint organisation represented a compromise between the ideas of both Levski and Karavelov. The committee network of the organisation in Bulgaria expanded considerably after the general meeting and the preparation of the uprising was well advanced, when a faction in BRCK led by Dimitar Obshti attacked a convoy of the Ottoman postal service near Sofia in order to procure money for ammunition. The robbery caused the exposure of a number of committee activists in the region of Sofia and eventually resulted in the capture and hanging of Vasil Levski on 18 February 1873. The dissolution of the committee network around Sofia and the death of Levski dealt a hard blow to BRCK and its work. The attempt to find a successor to Levski was unsuccessful, the Svoboda newspaper was banned by the Romanian authorities and Karavelov was forced to flee Romania for fear of being extradited to the Ottoman Empire. In 1874 Karavelov tried to regain control of the organisation at its second general meeting held in Bucharest but the other delegates passed censure on him and he left the organisation in March 1875. Karavelov was replaced as chairman of the BRCK by Hristo Botev, a revolutionary, poet and editor of the Zname (Flag) newspaper. In August 1875, the faction around Botev organised a third general meeting of the organisation which took a decision on a general uprising in Bulgaria in September the same year. The time for preparation of the insurrection was, however, insufficient and only the regional committee in Stara Zagora managed to organise a small- scale rebellion, quickly crushed by the Ottoman police. The failure of the uprising and the accusations of misappropriations of money which ensued forced Botev to resign. The organisation disbanded itself shortly afterwards, to assemble again in November 1875 in the town of Giurgiu where a decision on another general uprising was taken (see also April Uprising).

Basmati (pronounced in the Indian subcontinent) is a variety of long, slender-grained aromatic rice which is traditionally from the Indian subcontinent.Big money in \\"specialty rices\\" Food and Agriculture Organization, United Nations (2002) As of 2018-19, India exported 65% of the overseas basmati rice market, while Pakistan accounted for the remainder. Many countries use domestically grown basmati rice crops;Rice Sales From India to Reach Record as Iran Boosts Reserve Bloomberg (February 13, 2014) however, basmati is geographically exclusive to certain districts of India and Pakistan.Madhya Pradesh loses GI tag claim for Basmati; India may ask Pakistan to check farming Financial Express (March 19, 2018) According to the Indian Government agency APEDA, a rice variety is eligible to be called Basmati if it has a minimum average precooked milled rice length of 6.61 mm and average precooked milled rice breadth of up to 2 mm, among other parameters.  History and etymology  =Etymology= The word basmati has been derived from two Sanskrit roots vas(aroma) and mayup(ingrained). While combining mayup changes it mati making it vasmati. Basmati has been spelled differently like Bans-matti, Bansumutti, Bansmatti, Bansumutte, Basmatte. =History= Basmati rice is believed to have been cultivated in the Indian subcontinent for centuries. The earliest extant work to mention basmati rice is Heer Ranjha (1766). Basmati was introduced to the Middle East and Central Asia by Arab and Indian traders. It remains not only an important part of various cuisines of the Indian subcontinent, but now is also used extensively in Central Asian, Persian, Arab, and other Middle Eastern cuisines as well. This type of rice is grown and exported by those from the Indian subcontinent.  Production and cultivation  India accounts for over 70% of the world's basmati rice production. A small portion of that is being grown organically. Organisations such as Kheti Virasat Mission are trying to increase the amount of basmati rice that is being grown in the Punjab in India. =In India= The areas which have GI tag for Basmati rice production in India are in the states of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, Uttarakhand, Western Uttar Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir. India's total basmati production for the July 2011‚ÄìJune 2012 crop year was five million tonnes. From April 2018 to March 2019, India exported 4.4 million metric tons of Basmati rice. In 2015-16, Saudi Arabia, Iran and UAE were the three biggest destinations for India's Basmati rice exports and exports to these three countries accounted for more than half of India's total Basmati exports. In 2015-16, Basmati rice worth USD 3.4 billion was exported from India. = In Pakistan = According to the FAO, Pakistan's original Basmatic area lies in the Kalar bowl between the Ravi and Chenab rivers. Almost all the cultivation of Basmati takes place in the Punjab province where total production was 2.47 million tonnes in 2010.Rice export: ‚ÄòPakistan has potential of $4b but barely touches $1b‚Äô.

International Policy Digest, (7 Dec). = In Indonesia = Indonesia produced its own local variant of basmati in West Java and Central Kalimantan, with production capacity estimated to reach up to 8.2 tonnes per hectare. Basmati seeds were first brought from India in 2007, however the seeds were unable to be grown due to soil incompatibility. The Ministry of Agriculture then managed to produce and cultivate a hybrid between basmati and local rice in 2017. =In Nepal= Basmati rice is produced mainly in the Kathmandu Valley and the Terai region of Nepal. Unique Nepali varieties of basmati rice were barred from export to other parts of the world although this bar might be lifted. =In Sri Lanka= Small amount of Basmati rice, specially red Basmati rice is being cultivated in the tropical wet zone areas of Sri Lanka. https://foodsofnations.com/product/raw-red-rice-srilankan/ https://snukfoods.com/products/sri-lankan-red-basmati-rice http://www.island.lk/2002/02/26/opinio03.html  Aroma and flavour  Basmati rice has a typical pandan-like (Pandanus amaryllifolius leaf) flavour caused by the aroma compound 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline. Basmati grains contain about 0.09 ppm of this aromatic chemical compound naturally, a level that is about 12 times as much as non-basmati rice varieties, giving basmati its distinctive fragrance and flavour.Big money in \\"speciality rices\\" Food and Agriculture Organization, United Nations (2002) This natural aroma is also found in cheese, fruit and other cereals. It is a flavoring agent approved in the United States and Europe, and is used in bakery products for aroma.Fenaroli's Handbook of Flavor Ingredients, Sixth Edition, George A. Burdock (2009), CRC Press, , p. 36 During cooking, the level of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline decreases. Soaking the rice for 30 minutes before cooking permits 20% shorter cooking times and preserves more of the 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline.  Glycemic index  According to the Canadian Diabetes Association, basmati, brown, wild, short and long grain rice has a \\"medium\\" glycemic index (between 56 and 69) opposed to jasmine and \\"instant\\" white rice with a glycemic index of 89, thus making it more suitable for diabetics as compared to certain other grains and products made from white flour.  Varieties and hybrids  High resolution image of grain of brown basmati rice. There are several varieties of basmati rice. Traditional Indian types include basmati 370, basmati 385, and basmati Ranbirsinghpura (R.S.Pura) and Gujjar Chack area in Jammu province situated at the India-Pakistani border in Jammu and Kashmir state of India. 1121 and Muradabadi 6465 Extra Long Grain Rice. Pakistani varieties of basmati rice are PK 385, Super Kernel Basmati Rice and D-98. Scientists at Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Delhi, used conventional plant breeding to produce a hybrid semi-dwarf plant which had most of the good features of traditional basmati (grain elongation, fragrance, alkali content). This hybrid was called Pusa Basmati-1 (PB1; also called \\"Todal\\", because the flower has awns); crop yield is up to twice as high as traditional varieties. Fragrant rices that are derived from basmati stock but are not true basmati varieties include PB2 (also called sugandh-2), PB3, and RS-10. = Approved varieties = Basmati, P3 Punjab, type III Uttar Pradesh, hbc -19 Safidon, 386 Haryana, Kasturi (Baran, Rajasthan), Muradabadi Basmati 6465, Basmati 198, Basmati 217, Basmati 370 Bihar, Kasturi, Mahi Suganda, Pusa 1121.

This variant could be grown in low- altitude terrain and managed to attract interest among potential middle-to- upper class consumers. In the United States, a variety of rice based on basmati called Texmati is grown in Texas. In Kenya, a rice variety called Pishori or Pisori is grown in the Mwea region..The word Pishori is corruption of the word Peshawari from where the Basmati variety used to be imported to the countries of East Africa in the past.Lodhi, A.Y., 2019.

Basmati certification  The \\"Basmati Mark\\" is a DNA-fingerprinting-based certification done by the laboratory of Basmati Export Development Foundation (BEDF). On February 15, 2016, the Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), an autonomous organisation under the Department of Commerce in India, registered Basmati Rice as a product with Geographical Indication (GI).  Adulteration  Difficulty in differentiating genuine basmati from other types of rice and the significant price difference between them has led fraudulent traders to adulterate basmati rice with crossbred basmati varieties and long- grain non-basmati varieties. In Britain, the Food Standards Agency found in 2005 that about half of all basmati rice sold was adulterated with other strains of long-grain rice, prompting rice importers to agree to a code of practice.British Retail Consortium (July 2005). Code of practice on Basmati rice A 2010 UK test on rice supplied by wholesalers found 4 out of 15 samples had cheaper rice mixed with basmati, and one had no basmati at all. A PCR- based assay similar to DNA fingerprinting in humans allows adulterated and non-basmati strains to be detected, with a detection limit from 1% adulteration upwards with an error rate of ¬±1.5%.Basmati rice collaborative trial - FA0110. defra.gov.uk Exporters of basmati rice use \\"purity certificates\\" based on DNA tests for their basmati rice consignments.Archak, Sunil et al.

The patent secures lines of basmati and basmati-like rice and ways of analyzing that rice. RiceTec, owned by Prince Hans-Adam of Liechtenstein, faced international outrage over allegations of biopiracy. It had also caused a brief diplomatic crisis between India and the United States, with India threatening to take the matter to the WTO as a violation of TRIPS.

The Hindu tradition recognizes him as the founder of the Ramanandi Sampradaya, the largest monastic Hindu renunciant community in modern times.Selva Raj and William Harman (2007), Dealing with Deities: The Ritual Vow in South Asia, State University of New York Press, , pages 165-166James G Lochtefeld (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: N-Z, Rosen Publishing, , pages 553-554 Born in a Brahman family, Ramananda for the most part of his life lived in the holy city of Varanasi.David Lorenzen, Who Invented Hinduism: Essays on Religion in History, , pages 104-106 His year of birth or death are uncertain, but historical evidence suggests he was one of the earliest saints and a pioneering figure of the Bhakti movement as it rapidly grew in north India, sometime between the 14th and mid 15th century during its Islamic rule period. Tradition asserts that Ramananda developed his philosophy and devotional themes inspired by the south Indian Vedanta philosopher Ramanuja, however evidence also suggests that Ramananda was influenced by Nathpanthi ascetics of the Yoga school of Hindu philosophy. An early social reformer, Ramananda accepted disciples without discriminating anyone by gender, class, caste or religion (he accepted Muslims).Gerald James Larson (1995), India's Agony Over Religion, State University of New York Press, , page 116 Traditional scholarship holds that his disciples included later Bhakti movement poet-sants such as Kabir, Ravidas, Bhagat Pipa and others, however some postmodern scholars have questioned some of this spiritual lineage while others have supported this lineage with historical evidence.Schomer and McLeod (1987), The Sants: Studies in a Devotional Tradition of India, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 54Julia Leslie (1996), Myth and Mythmaking: Continuous Evolution in Indian Tradition, Routledge, , pages 117-119 His verse is mentioned in the Sikh scripture Adi Granth.Winnand Callewaert (2015), The Hagiographies of Anantadas: The Bhakti Poets of North India, Routledge, , pages 405-407 Ramananda was known for composing his works and discussing spiritual themes in vernacular Hindi, stating that this makes knowledge accessible to the masses.William Pinch (1996), Peasants and Monks in British India, University of California Press, , pages 53-89  Biography  Little is known with certainty about the life of Ramananda, including year of birth and deathEnzo Turbiani (Editor: RS McGregor, 1992), Devotional Literature in South Asia, Cambridge University Press, , page 51 His biography has been derived from mentions of him in secondary literature and inconsistent hagiographies. The most accepted version holds that Ramananda was born in a yadav family,Max Arthur Macauliffe (2013 Reprint), The Sikh Religion: Its Gurus, Sacred Writings and Authors, Volume 6, Cambridge University Press, , pages 100-101 about mid 14th-century, and died about mid 15th-century.Charlotte Vaudeville (1974), Kabir, Vol. 1, Oxford University Press, , pages 110-117Selva Raj and William Harman (2007), Dealing with Deities: The Ritual Vow in South Asia, State University of New York Press, , pages 165-185Nirmal Dass (2000), Songs of the Saints from the Adi Granth, State University of New York Press, , page 160-164 Although few people hold him to be of southern origin, there's no evidence to support such a claim. In fact, all genuinely Indian sources agree in stating that Ramananada was born at Prayaga (Allahabad). > \\"Not one word is said as to his southern origin, and the fact that he was > stated to be a Kanyakubja Brahmin is decisively against such a theory\\" > ‚ÄìGeorge A. Greirson (1920). According to the medieval era Bhaktamala text by Nabhadas, Ramananda studied under Raghavananda, a guru (teacher) in Vedanta-based Vatakalai (northern, Rama-avatar) school of Vaishnavism.Karen Pechelis (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, , page 36 > \\"It was Ramananda's teacher, Raghavananda, who came from the South, and > after much wandering had settled at Benares. There, and not in the South, he > had Ramananda as his disciple.\\" ‚ÄìGeorge A. Greirson (1920). Other scholars state that Ramananda's education started in Adi Shankara's Advaita Vedanta school, before he met Raghavananda and began his studies in Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita Vedanta school.Edmour J Babineau (2008), Love of God and Social Duty in the RƒÅmcaritmƒÅnas, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 65-66 Literary works Ramananda is credited as the author of many devotional poems, but like most Bhakti movement poets, whether he actually was the author of these poems is unclear. Two treatises in Hindi, Gyan-lila and Yog-cintamani are also attributed to Ramanand, as are the Sanskrit works Vaisnava Mata Bhajabhaskara and Ramarcana paddhati. However, poems found in the original and well-preserved manuscripts of Sikhism and handwritten Nagari-pracarini Sabha are considered authentic and highlight the Nirguna (attributeless god) stream of thought in Ramananda.  Philosophy  Ramananda developed his philosophy and devotional themes inspired by the south Indian Vedanta philosopher Ramanuja, however evidence also suggests that Ramananda was influenced by Nathpanthi ascetics of the Yoga school of Hindu philosophy. Antonio Rigopoulos states Ramananda's teachings were \\"an attempt towards a synthesis between Advaita Vedanta and Vaishnava bhakti\\".Antonio Rigopoulos (1993), The Life And Teachings Of Sai Baba Of Shirdi, State University of New York Press, , page 264 He adds that the same link can be found in the 15th-century text of Adhyatma Ramayana, but there is no historical proof that Ramananda's teachings inspired that text. Shastri has proposed the theory that Ramananda's complex theological schooling in two distinct Hindu philosophies explains why he accepted both Saguna Brahman and Nirguna Brahman, or god with attributes and god without attributes respectively. Shastri suggests his theory offers an explanation why Ramananda's disciples co-developed saguna and nirguna as the two parallel currents in the Bhakti movement.Edmour J Babineau (2008), Love of God and Social Duty in the RƒÅmcaritmƒÅnas, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 66-67 However, this theory lacks historical evidence and has not gained wide acceptance by scholars. The Ramananda literature that is considered authentic, states Enzo Turbiani, suggest a milestone development in metaphysical principles of the Bhakti movement.Enzo Turbiani (Editor: RS McGregor, 1992), Devotional Literature in South Asia, Cambridge University Press, , pages 52-54 Ramananda asserts that austerity and penances through asceticism are meaningless, if an individual does not realize Hari (Vishnu) as their inner self. He criticizes fasting and rituals, stating that the mechanics are not important, and that these are useless if the individual does not take the opportunity to reflect and introspect on the nature of Brahman (supreme being). Ramananda states that rote reading of a sacred text is of no benefit, if the person fails to understand what the text is trying to communicate.  Legacy  Ramananda is often honored as the founder of Sant-parampara (literally, the tradition of bhakti sants) in north India.Antonio Rigopoulos (1993), The Life And Teachings Of Sai Baba Of Shirdi, State University of New York Press, , page 37 His efforts, in a time when Ganges river plains of north India was under Islamic rule, helped revive and refocus Hindus to a personalized, direct devotional form of Rama worship, his liberalism and focus on the devotee's commitment rather than birth or gender set a precedent that attracted people to spirituality from various walks of life, and his use of vernacular language instead of Sanskrit for spiritual ideas made sharing and reflection easier for the masses.Edmour J Babineau (2008), Love of God and Social Duty in the RƒÅmcaritmƒÅnas, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 65-68 = Twelve disciples of Jagadguru Ramanandacharya = Twelve influential disciples of Ramananda included 10 men and 2 women poet-sants. According to Bhaktamal, these were:Rekha Pande (2014), Divine Sounds from the Heart‚ÄîSinging Unfettered in their Own Voices, Cambridge Scholars, , page 77 Men scholars: # Anantananda # Sursurananda # Sukhanand # NaraharidƒÅsa # Bhavanand # Bhagat Pipa # Kabir # Sen # Dhanna # Ravidas Women scholars: # Sursuri # Padyawati Postmodern scholars have questioned some of the above guru-disciple lineage while others have supported this lineage with historical evidence. = Largest ascetic community in India: Ramanandi Sampraday = Ramananda is the founder of the eponymous Ramanandi Sampraday (Shri Ramavat or Shri Sampraday). This is the largest ascetic community in India, and their members are known as Ramanandis, Vairagis or Bairagis.Ramdas Lamb (2008), Theory and Practice of Yoga (Editor: Knut A Jacobsen), Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 317-330 They are known for their self-imposed highly disciplined, austere, structured and simple lifestyle. Richard Burghart acknowledges that Ramananda is revered as the founder in the Ramanandi Sampraday's tradition, but adds that historical evidence about its origin is meager and India's largest monastic community may have gathered strength a few centuries after Ramananda's death.Richard Burghart (1978), The Founding of the Ramanandi Sect, Ethnohistory, Vol. 25, No. 2, pages 121-139 =Social reforms= Ramananda was an influential social reformer of Northern India. He championed the pursuit of knowledge and direct devotional spirituality, and did not discriminate based on birth family, gender or religion. = Swami Ramanand poem = One poem of Swami Ramanand poem, originally written in Hindi, is a response to an invitation to go to a temple, and the answer states there is no need to visit a temple because God is within a person, all pervasive in everything and everyone.

The screenplay was written by A. I. Bezzerides based on the novel Mad with Much Heart, by Gerald Butler. The drama features Ida Lupino, Robert Ryan, Ward Bond, and others. Synopsis Bitter, cynical police detective, Jim Wilson (Robert Ryan), is known for beating information out of suspects and witnesses. His violent tendencies are noticed by both his partners and the police chief. After Wilson ignores the chief's warnings, he is relegated to a case up-state so that he might cool off. He joins a manhunt for the murderer of a young girl‚Äîteaming up with the father of the victim, Walter Brent (Ward Bond), who is determined to exact deadly vengeance. During a chase, after the murderer is spotted, Wilson and Brent are separated from the others and eventually track the killer to a remote house. Initially, they do not locate the murderer but find Mary Malden (Ida Lupino), a blind woman, by herself in the house. They learn that she lives with her brother, Danny (Sumner Williams). Wilson is drawn to the selfless Mary and, when he learns that the murderer is her brother and that he is mentally ill, he agrees to her request that he protect the young man. Mary knows that Danny is hiding in the storm cellar; she tries to make him understand that there is a man, Wilson, who is a friend to them and that he will take Danny away to be helped. On her way back to the house, Wilson confronts her and, as she is explaining to him that her brother is too frightened right then to be dealt with, Danny flees the cellar. Wilson trails him to a secluded shack and, though Danny is brandishing a knife, manages to engage him in a conversation which seems to be calming and may be leading to a surrender. Then, Brent bursts in. A fight ensues between the two men; Brent's gun goes off and Danny escapes. The two men chase him up a rugged mountainside where Danny loses his footing and falls to his death. Brent is shocked by Danny's youth. He carries him to the home of a neighbor of Mary's. Mary arrives, having walked from her home after hearing the gunshot. Later, she and Wilson walk back to her house where they have an intimate conversation. He indicates he would like to stay with her but she insists he leave, not wanting anyone around her merely for sympathy. Wilson drives to the city, but he's a changed man. In the end, he returns to Mary.

He wrote, \\"the story is a shallow, uneven affair, as written by A. I. Bezzerides from Gerald Butler's Mad With Much Heart. The cause of the cop's sadism is only superficially explained, and certainly his happy redemption is easily and romantically achieved. And while a most galling performance of the farmer is given by Ward Bond, Ida Lupino is mawkishly stagey as the blind girl who melts the cop's heart. For all the sincere and shrewd direction and the striking outdoor photography, this R. K. O. melodrama fails to traverse its chosen ground.\\" Fernando F. Croce, film critic for Slant magazine, liked the film and wrote, \\"Perched between late-'40s noir and mid-'50s crime drama, this is one of the great, forgotten works of the genre... Easily mushy, the material achieves a nearly transcendental beauty in the hands of Ray, a poet of anguished expression: The urban harshness of the city is contrasted with the austere snowy countryside for some of the most disconcertingly moving effects in all film noir. Despite the violence and the steady intensity, a remarkably pure film.\\"Croce, Fernando F. Slant magazine, film review, 2006. Last accessed: January 30, 2008. Critic Dennis Schwartz liked the film and acting in the drama and wrote, \\"A schematic film noir by Nicholas Ray (They Live by Night) that overcomes its artificial contrivances to become a touching psychological drama about despair and loneliness--one of the best of this sort in the history of film noir... Robert Ryan's fierce performance is superb, as he's able to convincingly assure us he has a real spiritual awakening; while Lupino's gentle character acts to humanize the crime fighter, who has walked on the \\"dangerous ground\\" of the city and has never realized before that there could be any other kind of turf until meeting someone as profound and tolerant as Mary.\\"Schwartz, Dennis . Ozus' World Movie Reviews, film review, January 30, 2005. Last accessed: January 30, 2008. Music The film score was composed by Bernard Herrmann (1911‚Äì1975). Instrumentation: piccolo, 3 flutes, 2 oboes, an English horn, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 8 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, bass drum, tam-tam, bell plate, piano, solo viola d'amore and strings. Herrmann wanted to use an obscure baroque instrument, the viola d'amore, to symbolize Mary Malden's isolation and loneliness. The sound of the instrument can be heard much of the time she is on-screen. Herrmann was so impressed with viola d'amorist Virginia Majewski's performance that he wanted her credited in the film. Nicholas Ray told him \\"There aren't enough cards,\\" so Herrmann replied, \\"Put her on mine.\\" In the film's opening credits, Bernard Herrmann's credit reads, \\"Music by Bernard Herrmann ‚Äî Viola d'Amour played by Virginia Majewski.\\" Roland Kato, Interview with Virginia Majewski, Newsletter of the Viola d'amore Society of America, Volume 19, Number 2, 1995. At the 35:25 mark, listeners can hear a sequence that Herrmann reused in 1957 as the well-known opening theme to the television series Have Gun Will Travel starring Richard Boone. The scoring in the film version is only slightly different from that in the better-known TV theme; the sequence in which this theme appears also contains other fragments of incidental music later adapted for use in the TV show.

The complex consists of two buildings: the original McLaren Technology Centre, which acts as the main headquarters for the group, and the newer McLaren Production Centre, primarily used for manufacturing McLaren Automotive cars. The main building is a large, roughly semi-circular, glass- walled building, designed by the architect Norman Foster and his company, Foster and Partners. The building was short-listed for the 2005 Stirling Prize, which was won by the Scottish Parliament building. Approximately 1,000 people work at the Technology Centre. It is home to the McLaren Formula One constructor and McLaren Automotive, the manufacturer of the McLaren F1 and McLaren Senna, as well as other companies of the McLaren Group. It was also the main setting of McLaren's cartoon, Tooned. In 2011, the size of the centre was doubled after a second building, the McLaren Production Centre, was built. McLaren is also planning an extension to this building to be used as an applied technology centre, and to house a new wind tunnel for McLaren Racing. Features The building is accompanied by a series of artificial lakes: one formal lake directly opposite that completes the circle of the building, and a further four 'ecology' lakes. Together they contain about 50,000 m¬≥ of water. This water is pumped through a series of heat exchangers to cool the building and to dissipate the heat produced by the wind tunnels. The main working space of the building is split into 18 metre wide sections known as 'fingers' that are separated by corridors known as 'streets'. Facilities for employees include a 700-seat restaurant, a juice and coffee bar, a swimming pool and a fitness centre. An underground Visitor and Learning Centre is connected to the main building by a walkway. A , rectangular-circuit shaped wind tunnel is located at one end of the building. Team McLaren uses it for testing and development of aerodynamic parts, as well as testing aerodynamic set-ups. The tunnel contains 400 tonnes of steel and the air is propelled by a fan that rotates at up to 600 rpm. The Technology Centre consolidated all aspects of the McLaren Group at one site, instead of the 18 separate sites previously occupied. History McLaren's original application to build a new headquarters was made in 1995 and was unopposed by Woking Borough Council, however the development of such a large industrial site in green belt land led the Department of the Environment to order a public inquiry. The Environment Secretary, John Gummer, gave the development his approval in March 1997 under rules which allow development in the green belt \\"in very special circumstances\\"; Gummer said the McLaren application was such a case due to the economic and business arguments of the proposals and that he took the view that \\"[McLaren] is exceptional, both in the quality of its products and its achievements.\\" Work on the project, originally known as the Paragon Technology Centre, started in 1998 and about 4,000 construction workers were involved in what the Financial Times said \\"[was] claimed to be the biggest privately funded construction project in Europe.\\"Griffiths, John. \\"McLaren to build Mercedes sports car at Pounds 200m complex\\" Financial Times. 9 February 2000 Retrieved on 2007-05-26. In February 2000, DaimlerChrysler purchased 40 percent of the McLaren Group and McLaren subsequently announced it would build the Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren at the new facility. Dennis explained one of his rationales for the project in 2000: \\"Put a man in a dark room, he's hot, it smells bad, versus a guy in a cool room, well-lit, smells nice... When you throw a decision at those two individuals, who's going to be better equipped to effect good judgment and make a good decision?\\" McLaren employees started using the facility in May 2003. McLaren has not disclosed the project's cost, but BBC News suggested a figure of GB¬£300m. ;McLaren Production Centre A second facility, the McLaren Production Centre, was built beside the McLaren Technology Centre in 2011 and serves as the production site of McLaren Automotive's road cars, including the McLaren 720S and McLaren Senna. ;Extension Planning permission for an extension to the McLaren Production Centre was granted in 2016. This \\"applied technology centre\\" will include \\"an aerodynamic research facility, workshops, research and development space, offices, meeting rooms, teaching and training space, vehicle preparation and assembly spaces, together with terraced car parking and two car park decks, cycle parking, a replacement helipad, and service areas.\\"  References  *Cropley, S (14.

The film stars Nicolas Cage as a private investigator who delves into the world of snuff films. Joaquin Phoenix, James Gandolfini, Peter Stormare, and Anthony Heald appear in supporting roles. Plot Private investigator Tom Welles is contacted by Daniel Longdale, attorney for wealthy widow Mrs. Christian, whose husband has recently died. While clearing out her late husband's safe, she and Longdale find an 8mm movie which appears to depict a real murder of a girl, but Mrs. Christian wants to know for certain. Welles is bound by obligation from both Longdale and Mrs. Christian not to reproduce the film in any way, and that only they need to know about the investigation. After looking through missing persons files, Welles discovers the girl is Mary Ann Mathews and visits her mother, Janet Mathews. While searching the house with her permission, he finds Mary Ann's diary, in which she says she went to Hollywood to become a film star. He asks Mrs. Mathews if she wants to know the truth, even if it is the worst. She says that she wants to know what happened to her daughter. In Hollywood, with the help of an adult video store employee called Max California, Welles delves into the world of underground (and sometimes illegal) fetish pornography. He attempts to find out if snuff is indeed real, or if there was anyone in this underworld who was connected to this film. Contact with a sleazy talent scout named Eddie Poole leads them to director Dino Velvet, whose violent pornographic films star a masked man known as \\"Machine\\" who rapes and tortures women. To gain more evidence, Welles pretends to be a client interested in commissioning a hardcore BDSM film to be directed by Velvet and starring Machine. Velvet agrees and arranges a meeting in New York City. The meeting turns out to be an ambush. Longdale and Poole appear and hold Welles at gunpoint. It's now clear that the film was real; Mr. Christian contacted Longdale to procure a snuff film, and being unable to find one, he commissioned Velvet and Poole to make one. Velvet and Machine produce a bound and beaten California, whom they abducted to force Welles to bring them the only surviving copy of the illegal film. Longdale and Welles go to Welles' car to retrieve the film, in which Longdale admits that he never thought Welles would get as far as he did, and just wanted to placate Mrs. Christian with the investigation. Once he delivers it, they burn it and kill California. As they are about to kill Welles, he tells them that Mr. Christian paid $1 million for the film. Velvet, Poole, and Machine received $50,000 and Longdale kept the major portion. In an ensuing fight, Velvet and Longdale are both killed; Welles wounds Machine and escapes. Welles calls Mrs. Christian to tell her his discoveries and recommends going to the police, to which she agrees. Arriving at her estate, Welles is told that Mrs. Christian committed suicide after hearing the news. She left envelopes for the Mathews family and Welles: it contains the rest of his payment and a note reading; \\"Try to forget us\\". Welles warns his already frantic wife of the impending danger and to seek shelter in a location known only to them, and hands her his half of the money. Welles decides to seek justice for the murdered girl by killing the remaining people involved. Tracking down Poole, Welles takes him to the shooting location and tries to kill him. He can't bring himself to do it amid Poole's taunting, and steps out of the house. He calls Mrs. Mathews to tell her about her daughter and asks for her permission to punish those responsible; \\"Just tell me that you loved her\\". Mrs. Mathews breaks down in hysterics once presented with the truth, but affirms that she loved her daughter. With that, Welles returns and beats Poole to death with his pistol, burning his body and the pornography from his car. Welles traces Machine and attacks him at his home. Welles unmasks him, revealing a bald, bespectacled man named George. He reveals to Welles that his sadism is not the result of childhood abuse; he kills people simply because he enjoys it. They struggle, and Welles kills him. After returning to his family, Welles breaks down in front of his wife as he tries to process all of the evil that he had seen over the course of the investigation.

The film made $36,663,315 domestically and $59,955,384 internationally for a total of $96,618,699, more than double its $40 million production budget. The film received negative reviews from critics. It has a rating of 21% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 84 reviews with an average rating of 4.19/10. The consensus states that \\"its sadistic violence is unappealing and is lacking in suspense and mystery.\\" The film also has a score of 19 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 20 reviews indicating \\"overwhelming dislike.\\" Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of \\"C-\\" on scale of A+ to F. Derek Elley of Variety criticized the film, stating that \\"8MM is a movie that keeps jumping the gate and finally unravels all over the floor.\\" Roger Ebert was one of the film's admirers and gave the film three stars out of four, stating on his website \\"I know some audience members will be appalled by this film, as many were by Seven. It is a very hard R that would doubtless have been NC-17 if it had come from an indie instead of a big studio with clout. But it is a real film. Not a slick exploitation exercise with all the trappings of depravity but none of the consequences. Not a film where moral issues are forgotten in the excitement of an action climax. Yes, the hero is an ordinary man who finds himself able to handle violent situations, but that's not the movie's point. The last two words of the screenplay are \\"save me\\" and by the time they're said, we know what they mean.\\" Soundtrack The film score was composed by Mychael Danna.

The term Indology (in German, Indologie) is often associated with German scholarship, and is used more commonly in departmental titles in German and continental European universities than in the anglophone academy. In the Netherlands the term Indologie was used to designate the study of Indian history and culture in preparation for colonial service in the Dutch East Indies. Specifically, Indology includes the study of Sanskrit literature and Hinduism along with the other Indian religions, Jainism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and PƒÅli literature. Dravidology is the separate branch dedicated to the Dravidian languages of South India. Hindu texts in Dravidian languages are considered disciplines in Indology. Some scholars distinguish Classical Indology from Modern Indology, the former more focussed on Sanskrit and other ancient language sources, the latter on contemporary India, its politics and sociology.  History  = Precursors = The beginnings of the study of India by travellers from outside the subcontinent date back at least to Megasthenes (ca. 350‚Äì290 BC), a Greek ambassador of the Seleucids to the court of Chandragupta (ruled 322-298 BC), founder of the Mauryan Empire. Based on his life in India Megasthenes composed a four-volume Indica, fragments of which still exist, and which influenced the classical geographers Arrian, Diodor and Strabo. Megasthenes reported that the caste system dominated an essentially illiterate India. Panthapalli A.

He studied the anthropology of India, engaging in extensive participant observation with various Indian groups, learning their languages and studying their primary texts, and presenting his findings with objectivity and neutrality using cross-cultural comparisons. = Academic discipline = Indology as generally understood by its practitioners began in the later Early Modern period and incorporates essential features of modernity, including critical self-reflexivity, disembedding mechanisms and globalization, and the reflexive appropriation of knowledge. An important feature of Indology since its beginnings in the late eighteenth century has been the development of networks of academic communication and trust through the creation of learned societies like the Asiatic Society of Bengal, and the creation of learned journals like the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society and Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute. One of the defining features of Indology is the application of scholarly methodologies developed in European Classical Studies or \\"Classics\\" to the languages, literatures and cultures of South Asia. In the wake of eighteenth century pioneers like William Jones, Henry Thomas Colebrooke, Gerasim Lebedev or August Wilhelm Schlegel, Indology as an academic subject emerged in the nineteenth century, in the context of British India, together with Asian studies in general affected by the romantic Orientalism of the time. The Asiatic Society was founded in Calcutta in 1784, Soci√©t√© Asiatique founded in 1822, the Royal Asiatic Society in 1824, the American Oriental Society in 1842, and the German Oriental Society (Deutsche Morgenl√§ndische Gesellschaft) in 1845, the Japanese Association of Indian and Buddhist StudiesEnglish Summary .

Sanskrit literature included many pre- modern dictionaries, especially the NƒÅmali·πÖgƒÅnu≈õƒÅsana of Amarasi·πÉha, but a milestone in the Indological study of Sanskrit literature was publication of the St. Petersburg Sanskrit-W√∂rterbuch during the 1850s to 1870s. Translations of major Hindu texts in the Sacred Books of the East began in 1879. Otto von B√∂htlingk's edition of PƒÅ·πáini's grammar appeared in 1887. Max M√ºller's edition of the Rigveda appeared in 1849‚Äì75. Albrecht Weber commenced publishing his pathbreaking journal Indologische Studien in 1849, and in 1897 Sergey Oldenburg launched a systematic edition of key Sanskrit texts, \\"Bibliotheca Buddhica\\". =Fueling anti-Semitism= German indologists arbitrarily identified \\"layers\\" in the Mahabharata and Bhagavad Gita with the objective of fueling European anti-Semitism via the popular Aryan invasion theory. This required equating Brahmins with Jews, resulting in anti-Brahmanism. = Indology and the modern world = From the late 16th century to the late 18th century, Hinduism was seen as highly on civilization and scholarly basis. But after the 19th century, western scholars often criticized India and Hinduism without ever visiting India or reading Hindu scriptures (i.e. E. M. Forster). As with many academic subjects which seem to have no direct bearing on modern concerns, Indology has come in for criticism. This has prompted a vigorous response from a number of eminent scholars, among them J. Bronkhorst.Bronkhorst, Johannes.

Lasseter's accounts of the find are conflicting and its precise location remains a mystery‚Äîif it exists. Discovery In 1929 and again in 1930 Harold Bell Lasseter (1880‚Äì1931) made different (and possibly conflicting) claims that either in 1911 or in 1897, he had discovered a rich gold deposit. On 14 October 1929 he wrote a letter to Kalgoorlie federal member, Albert Green, claiming to have discovered \\"a vast gold bearing reef in Central Australia\\" 18 years earlier and that it was located at the western edge of the MacDonnell Ranges. He made a similar claim to other officials and was interviewed by a commissioner and a geologist, however the government took no action to investigate the claim. It was revealed that from 1908 to 1913 Lasseter lived on a lease-hold farm near Tabulam. In March 1930 he provided a different story to John Bailey of the Australian Workers' Union. In this claim Lasseter details that as a young man of the age of 17, he rode on horse from Queensland to the West Australian gold fields, during which he stumbled across a huge gold reef somewhere near the border between the Northern Territory and Western Australia. However Lasseter had been sentenced to reform school at that time. According to the story told to Bailey, Lasseter was about west of Alice Springs in a line towards Kalgoorlie. He claimed that subsequent to this discovery he got into difficulties and was fortuitously rescued by a passing Afghan camel driver who took him to the camp of a surveyor, Joseph Harding. Harding and Lasseter were said to have later returned to the reef in the attempt to fix its location, but failed because their watches were inaccurate. As the expedition with Harding dated in the years before World War I, the two different versions about the finding of the reef could have been unconflicting; it is possible that Lasseter did refer sometimes to his first finding in 1897 and sometimes to the first expedition with Harding. According to Lasseter, he spent the next three decades trying to raise sufficient interest to fund an expedition into the interior. But at the time the fortunes being made from the gold rush at Kalgoorlie in Western Australia meant that no-one was prepared to risk trekking into the uncharted desert wilderness of central Australia, even if the supposed discovery was as rich as he claimed. The 1930 expedition By 1930, when Australia was in the grip of the Great Depression, the attractions of desert gold were much greater, and Lasseter succeeded in securing approximately ¬£50,000 in private funding towards an expedition to relocate the reef. Unusual for the time, this expedition included motorised vehicular transport and an aircraft. Accompanying Lasseter were experienced bushmen Fred Blakeley (leader) and Frank Colson as well as George Sutherland (prospector), Phil Taylor (engineer, driver), Blakeston-Houston (governor-general's aide, 'explorer') and Errol Coote (pilot). On 21 July 1930 the group left Alice Springs, Lasseter was a sullen companion and a vague guide. They headed for Ilbilba (aka Ilbpilla Soak) ‚Äì an aerodrome created earlier that year for Donald George Mackay's expedition, near Lake Mackay. The group endured logistical difficulties and physical hardships (including the loss of a plane). On reaching Mount Marjorie (now Mount Leisler), Lasseter declared that they were too far north of the search zone. Exasperated, Blakeley declared Lasseter a charlatan, and decided to end the expedition. They parted with Lasseter at Ilbilba. Lasseter insisted on continuing the trek, accompanied by a dingo-shooter, Paul Johns, and his team of camels. Lasseter, whose behaviour was increasingly erratic, set off towards The Olgas. One afternoon Lasseter returned to camp with some concealed rock samples and announced that he had relocated the gold reef. He refused to reveal its location. Johns, who by now doubted Lasseter's sanity, accused him of being a liar. A fight ensued, and Johns left Lasseter to his own devices, returning to 'civilization'. Lasseter himself trudged off into the desert sands with two camels. A search for Lasseter was conducted by a bushman, Bob Buck. In March 1931 Buck found Lasseter's emaciated body at Winter's Glen and his personal effects in a cave at Hull's Creek. From Lasseter's diary it was learned that after Johns had left, Lasseter's camels bolted, leaving him alone in the desert without any means of sustaining himself or returning. He encountered a group of nomadic Aboriginal people, who rendered assistance with food and shelter; but a weakened and blinded Lasseter eventually died of malnutrition and exhaustion, having made a belated attempt to walk from the cave to Uluru or the Kata Tjuta. Various statements by Paul Johns reveal the areas where he and Lasseter travelled and searched while together: the Petermann and Rawlinson Ranges, then south-west to the Warburton Range, then a zigzag course evidently following the ranges eastward to the Western Australian border ending at the Petadi rock hole at the eastern end of the Mann Range in South Australia.McKeague, Jim, Sam Hazlett and the Search for Lasseter's Reef, 2015, chapter 9 and map 2 Almost out of supplies they then returned to Ilbilba where they parted. Geologists have made various statements as to whether or not there are gold bearing areas in this country. In 1931 geologists T. Blatchford and H.W.B.

Popular adventure-story author Ion Idriess, in his book Lasseter's Last Ride (1931), gives a detailed description of Lasseter's time with the Aborigines. His diary's notes were hidden under camp fires from the Aborigines. They had shunned Lasseter after their Kurdaitcha man \\"pointed the bone at him\\" ‚Äì he was condemned to be ignored and no longer cared for. Another story is told in Pintupi-Luritja language and English in Laatjatanya Yanutja, available in the Living Archive of Aboriginal Languages. In popular culture Lasseter's Reef became a famous Australian folk tale. It inspired a sub-plot in the film, Strike Me Lucky (1934), and Lasseter's fate was recreated in the movie Phantom Gold (1936). In 1974, Bill Gill Productions and Australian Film School worked on a film version of Lasseter's Last Ride. Two songs are titled \\"Lasseter's Last Ride\\"; the first by Peter Dawson and Edward Harrington and performed by Peter Dawson (May 1940), and the second by Dean Thomas (September 2012).

Early life and career After his schooling, Stanley worked in New Haven and Fayetteville, North Carolina, before returning to New Britain in 1826. He held several positions, including as a clerk on steamboats and in general stores. Stanley was involved in a number of New Britain businesses, including as a machine manufacturer for the growing iron business in Hartford, the state's capital. With the investment flourishing, Frederick and his brother William purchased the remainder of that business and decided to expand. After four years the pair invested in a brass foundry named Stanley Woodruff & Company. As early as 1842 the Stanleys began business ultimately opening Stanley Bolt Manufacturing. The company manufactured bolts, hinges, and other hardware from wrought iron. When Frederick wanted to expand the manufacture of hinges, he started a separate company, the Stanley Works which was incorporated in 1853. In 1920 the company merged with the Stanley Rule and Level Company (also of New Britain), founded by his cousin Henry Stanley in 1857, with Stanley Rule & Level becoming the tool division of the Stanley Works. When starting out as a hardware manufacturer Stanley traveled Connecticut selling and often installing the hardware he made. Not long after the Stanley Works was incorporated, Frederick hired William Hart, who grew the Stanley Works into the powerhouse it was to become. Some of his innovations were improving packaging of hardware to speed up sales, the invention of cold rolling steel and improving processes and developing machinery to increase production while reducing expenses. Politics and civic work Stanley served as both the first warden of New Britain in 1850 and its first Mayor following its incorporation in 1871 During his term he brought gas lighting, rail service, and a reservoir-fed water supply to the town. Personal life On July 4, 1838, Stanley married Melvinia Chamberlain and together they had three sons, Alfred Hubert, Frederick Henry, and William Chamberlain. Melvinia died aged 28 from scarlet fever and the two youngest boys died shortly thereafter. Stanley died on August 2, 1883 at the age of 80, ten days short of his 81st birthday. Following the deaths, Frederick moved in with his brother, William, who was also his business partner. Legacy Stanley is one of the world's most recognized brands of tools today, and they have produced millions of hand planes, saws, rulers, try squares, chisels, screwdrivers, and many other tools for consumer and industrial use. Their innovations include the Bailey hand plane, the Surform shaper, the PowerLock tape measure, and the box-cutter knife (utility knife). In 2010 Stanley Works merged with Black and Decker to become Stanley Black & Decker. * After bringing the railroad to New Britain in 1850, the first locomotive to come through town was named the Frederick T. Stanley. * Frederick Stanley sent a pair of suspenders from one of his businesses to President Andrew Jackson. In return, he received a hand written letter of thanks signed by the President himself. * A utility knife is often referred to as a Stanley knife.

He discovered gamma rays in 1900 while studying the radiation emanating from radium.  Early research  Villard was born in Saint-Germain- au-Mont-d'Or, Rh√¥ne. He graduated from the Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure in 1881 and taught in several Lyc√©es, ending with a Lyc√©e in Montpellier. He would maintain a laboratory position at the Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure until his retirement. At the time when he discovered what we now call gamma rays, Villard was working in the chemistry department of the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure rue d'Ulm, Paris. Villard is also credited with the discovery of argon hydrate. He spent the early part of his career (1888‚Äì1896) focusing on similar compounds at high pressure.  Discovery of gamma rays  Villard investigated the radiation from radium salts that escaped from a narrow aperture in a shielded container onto a photographic plate, through a thin layer of lead that was known to stop alpha rays. He was able to show that the remaining radiation consisted of a second and third type of rays. One of those was deflected by a magnetic field (as were the familiar \\"canal rays\\") and could be identified with Rutherford's beta rays. The last type was a very penetrating kind of radiation which had not been identified before... Villard was a modest man and he did not suggest a specific name for the type of radiation he had discovered. In 1903, it was Ernest Rutherford who proposed to call Villard's rays gamma rays because they were far more penetrating than the alpha rays and beta rays which he himself had already differentiated and named (in 1899) on the basis of their respective penetrating powers. The name stuck.  Later work  Taking an X-ray image with early Crookes tube apparatus in 1896. The Crookes tube is visible in the centre. The standing man is viewing his hand with a fluoroscope screen. This was a shortcut method for setting up the tube.No precautions against radiation exposure are being taken. Villard spent much time perfecting safer and more accurate methods of radiation dosimetry, which had been done very crudely up until then (typically by evaluating the quality of the image of the experimenter's hand produced on a photographic plate). In 1908, Villard pioneered the use of an ionization chamber for the dosimetry of ionizing radiation. He defined a unit of kerma which was later renamed the roentgen.  Retirement and death  When Villard retired, he left Paris. He died in Bayonne, France, on January 13th, 1934.

Monsterland Monsterland was introduced in the 1968 film Destroy All Monsters. The United Nations had decided to gather all the Earth's kaiju (giant monsters) and corral them into a single location, then keep them there. The Ogasawara Islands were chosen for the project and by 1999 (\\"at the close of the 20th century\\" according to the subtitles in the original Japanese version but on a newspaper it says 1994), Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra, Anguirus, Gorosaurus, Kumonga, Minilla, Baragon, Manda, and Varan were all residents of Monsterland. Various security devices were installed on the island to make sure the kaiju wouldn't escape. Among the various devices were machines that sprayed different types of mist that Godzilla and Mothra shied away from, as well as a magnetic wall that prevented Rodan from flying away. All was well until the Kilaaks invaded, taking control of Monsterland and letting loose the monsters upon the world. After the Kilaaks were foiled, the monsters returned to Monsterland and have been living there since. =Monsters on the island= * Anguirus * Baragon * Godzilla * Gorosaurus * Kumonga * Manda * Minilla * Mothra * Rodan * Varan Monster Island Monster Island first appeared in 1969's All Monsters Attack, in the dreams of a young boy named Ichiro. He dreamt of befriending Minilla and watching him and Godzilla battle other monsters. In the dream, the kaiju living on Monster Island included Godzilla, Minilla, Gabara, 3 Kamacuras, Kumonga, Ebirah, Anguirus, Gorosaurus, Manda, Giant Condor, Maneater (a plant man that grabs Ichiro in the jungle), and Rodan (mentioned but unseen). Monster Island is revealed to be an actual island in Godzilla vs. Gigan (1972). Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra, Anguirus, Minilla, Gorosaurus, Kumonga, and Kamacuras (one of them) are seen living there. Monster Island appeared again in Godzilla vs. Megalon (1973), one of many locations suffering the effects of nuclear testing. This is seen to disturb Godzilla, Rodan, and Anguirus. As they try to escape the explosions, Anguirus falls into a crevasse in the ground. Rodan's fate was never revealed, though it can be assumed he flew away safely. Godzilla was summoned from Monster Island in a few of the episodes of the television series Zone Fighter to assist the giant superhero, specifically the first episode that Godzilla appeared in. These Zone Fighter episodes are considered by Toho to be canon. It is commonly speculated to be Sollgel Island from Son of Godzilla due to its South Pacific location and the timing of introduction and presence of Godzilla, Minilla, Kamacuras and Kumonga, all kajiu who had been previously seen on the island whereas most other kajiu had not had set locations of origin. Also, \\"Monster Island\\" is an alternate name given to the island as stated in the Japanese version of the film by one of the characters as well as its Japanese title. =Monsters on the island= * Anguirus * Ebirah * Gabara * Giant Condor * Godzilla * Gorosaurus * Kamacuras * Kumonga * Manda * Maneater * Minilla * Rodan =Godzilla: The Series= Another version of Monster Island existed in Godzilla: The Series, the continuation of the 1998 film Godzilla. It is originally called Isla del Diablo (not to be confused with the real-life Devil's Island) and is given the codename: SITE OMEGA. This island was originally the base of operations for the Tachyon aliens as proposed by Major Hicks. The island eventually became home to Crustaceous Rex, King Cobra, the Giant Bat, Skeetera, the Giant Mutant Hummingbirds, and possibly the Shrewster as well as the combined monster population of the Mutant Colosseum and the Mutant Mania Circus. Godzilla also visited the island occasionally. Because he traveled with H.E.A.T., he never became a permanent resident. Large, cage-like apparatuses were installed on the island to keep the creatures isolated from each other and they remain on Monster Island to this day. At one point, the base was infiltrated by an organization of eco- terrorists called S.C.A.L.E. who tried to free the monsters, which only resulted in a large scale battle between the beasts before they were imprisoned in their respectful areas once again. In an alternate timeline shown in the episode \\"Future Shock\\", the monsters on Monster Island were unleashed by the United States military to help fight the invincible Dragma creatures. However, every monster (including Godzilla) that fought to protect a large number of humans was slaughtered by their might. They were given a hero's commemoration via a statue of Godzilla by the survivors. =Other Appearances= In Scott Ciencin's Godzilla junior novels, Monster Island first existed as a government research facility created to study Anguirus and Rodan. Eventually, with the help of a pair of psychic children, Godzilla led a troop of other monsters (including Varan, Kamacuras, Kumonga, and several oversized animals) to the island and make it their new home. The monsters were quickly disappointed, however, by humans such as scientists and military men constantly pestering them. Overeager tourists also regularly came to take their pictures. This changed after Godzilla rallied his fellow kaiju against King Ghidorah and saved the world. In gratitude, the humans abandoned Monster Island and gave it over to the monsters. Ciencin's last novel closed with Godzilla thinking that he had finally come home. Monster Island is a playable arena in the video games Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters Melee, Godzilla: Save the Earth, and Godzilla: Unleashed. In the latter, it has, like the game's other arenas, been affected by the spread of alien crystals. Early speculation was that the island would be partially flooded, but the arena is the same as that in the first two games other than the presence of the crystals. Producer Shelby Wills explained that the island is the \\"starting point\\" for the playable faction, Earth Defenders, in the game and so it does not show the same signs of apocalyptic damage as the game's other environments. Monster Island has also returned in IDW Publishing's Godzilla comics, particularly the Godzilla: Gangsters and Goliaths miniseries. Other Islands Other islands have appeared in Godzilla films as homes to the various monsters. They include Iwato island in Godzilla Raids Again where he fought Anguirus; Letchi Island - a home to Ebirah, the sea monster who Godzilla fought, in Ebirah, Horror of the Deep; and Sollgell Island where Godzilla adopted his son Minilla‚Äîand fought various monsters‚Äîin Son of Godzilla. In the second series of films he adopts his son on Adonoa Island (Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II) and raises him on Birth Island (Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla). Mothra is shown to live on Infant Island, sometimes with human worshipers, sometimes without. Toho's King Kong lives on his own island(s) - Farou and Mondo. A real \\"monster\\" On September 27, 2005, the first filmed evidence of a live \\"Architeuthis\\" (Giant Squid) in the wild was shot off near Ogasawara Islands, the islands which were used in much of the Godzilla mythos as being \\"Monster Island\\". In popular culture Several references to \\"Monster Island\\" are likely based on this element from the Godzilla series. * In The Simpsons episode \\"Lisa on Ice\\", Lisa imagines being sentenced to \\"a lifetime of horror on Monster Island\\" for failing Physical Education. The judge reassures her that the term \\"Monster Island\\" is just a name, but Lisa discovers that the island is in fact the home of several kaiju. Fleeing from the giant creatures (which are Mothra, Rodan and Gamera), Lisa asks one of her fellow inmates why the judge said it was \\"just a name\\". He replies that the judge meant Monster Island is in fact a peninsula. * The Monsta Island Czars are a hip-hop group from New York City, most of whose individual names are parodies of kaiju names. * In Warren Ellis' s Planetary series, there is Island Zero, home to many kaiju, including what is apparently King Ghidorah, Godzilla and Mothra, all dead. A green, flying kaiju similar to Rodan has, however, survived. * In DC Comics, Dinosaur Island was often called Mystery Island or Monster Island during its initial appearances in the pages of Star Spangled War Stories. * In the first issue of Marvel Comics' Fantastic Four series (1961), Monster Isle was the name of an island ruled by the villainous Mole Man and populated by various giant creatures which predates Toho's version. The island has been described both as located near Japan as well as in the Bermuda Triangle and has occasionally appeared in other Marvel comic books‚Äîalthough, surprisingly, never in Marvel's Godzilla series. Most of the known Marvel Comics monsters reside on Monster Isle. * On Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Xander Harris likes living near the Hellmouth rather than living on Monster Island. * In The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy TV movie Billy and Mandy's Big Boogey Adventure, the race that Team Grim and Team Boogey had to go through to win the privilege to fight Horror included getting past Monster Island, and encountered the Toho monsters Godzilla, Anguirus, Rodan, King Ghidorah and Gigan and the Daiei monster Gamera. Godzilla has his roar from the Heisei series. * In The Powerpuff Girls episode \\"Super Zeroes\\", a giant slimy teal blob-like monster named Steven (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) explains to the girls that going to Townsville to encounter the Powerpuff Girls and return (alive) from fighting them is a symbol of honor on Monster Isle, where most of the show's city-destroying monsters reside. In \\"Monstra-City\\", the deed to Monster Isle being claimed by the Mayor of Townsville causes all of its monsters to move to Townsville as the Powerpuff Girls work to keep the peace. The peace between the Townsville citizens and Monster Isle's monsters was brief until a one-eyed monster was poked in the eye by someone who claimed he kept looking at him. When the problem between the Townsville citizens and Monster Isle's monsters escalates, the Powerpuff Girls break up the fight as the only thing both groups have in common is that they hate each other. With help from a giant monster lawyer (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson), the Powerpuff Girls were able to get the Mayor of Townsville to give Monster Isle back to the monsters. * Top Ten includes a character named Gograh (a Godzilla-like monster) who is said to live on 'Monster Atoll' (presumably an island near Neopolis) with other giant monsters.

Chehabi, ‚ÄúTA·∏¥TI, ·∏†olƒÅm-Re≈ºƒÅ‚Äù, Encyclopaedia Iranica, Online Edition, originally published July 20, 2005 Popularly nicknamed JahƒÅn PahlevƒÅn (ÿ¨ŸáÿßŸÜ ŸæŸáŸÑŸàÿßŸÜ; \\"The World Champion\\") because of his chivalrous behavior and sportsmanship (Javanmardi in Iranian culture), he was the most popular athlete of Iran in the 20th century, although dozens of Iranian athletes have won more international medals than he did. Takhti is still a hero to many Iranians. He is listed in the FILA wrestling hall of fame.  Early life  Takhti, the youngest child of an Iranian family was born in Khaniabad neighborhood of south Tehran‚Äå. on August 27, 1930. At the age of 15, he entered Poulad Club in Southern Tehran and was trained in wrestling. He soon left Tehran to become a manual laborer in the oil-rich city of Masjed Soleiman. When he was called up for military service, his potential in wrestling was discovered and he began to train seriously soon after he was recruited as an Iran Railways employee in 1948.  Career  Takhti won his first Iranian championship in 1950, and on his first trip abroad in 1951, he won a silver medal at the world freestyle championships in Helsinki - the first international medal ever gained by an Iranian wrestler. One year later, he won another silver medal, again in Helsinki, this time in the 1952 Summer Olympic Games. The subsequent highlights of his career were the gold medal in the 1956 Summer Olympic Games in Melbourne, a gold in the world championships in 1959 (Tehran), another silver in the 1960 Summer Olympic Games in Rome and a silver in the 1961 World Championships in Yokohama. His Olympics career finished with one gold medal & two silver medals. He did however finish fourth in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics as well. Takhti started as a middleweight wrestler in the 79 kg and 87 kg categories, as he was getting heavier, he decided to move up to the next weight, 97 kg, for the 1964 Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo. He was unable to win a medal and he finished in 4th place. = Character on the wrestling mat = Takhti tended to act fairly when competing against rivals during his career, something which originated from traditional values of Zurkhaneh, a kind of heroic behaviour that epitomizes chivalrous qualities known as Javanmardi. For instance, he once had a match with Russian wrestler Alexander Medved who had an injured right knee. When Takhti found out that Medved was injured, he avoided touching the injured leg and tried to attack the other leg instead. He lost the match, but showed that he valued honorable behavior more than reaching victory. Another example of his character comes from a match in Moscow. After defeating the then-world champion Anatoli Albul, Takhti saw the sorrow on the face of Albul's mother. Takhti went to her and said, \\"I'm sorry about the result, but your son is a great wrestler.\\" She smiled and kissed him.  Social and political activisms  Takhti was known for his anti-regime views. He was a pro-Mossadegh activist and member of Second National Front and his death sparked a number of anti-Shah demonstrations. In 1962, a terrible earthquake occurred in Bou'in-Zahra in western Iran, killing over 12,000. Takhti was deeply touched by the suffering. Already one of Iran's biggest stars, he began to walk one of the main avenues of Tehran, asking for assistance for the victims. He inspired other champions to follow in his footsteps, and thousands gave to alleviate the suffering.  Death and legacy Ebn-e Babvieh Takhti was found dead in his hotel room on January 7, 1968. The Iranian government officially proclaimed his death a suicide. However, some claim that he was murdered because of his political activities against the Pahlavi regime, accusing SAVAK, the Iranian intelligence agency at that time. Because he was a national hero his funeral, organized by Hossein Towfigh, editor in chief of the late Towfigh magazine, drew hundreds of thousands of mourners. Towfigh magazine issued a special edition of their popular weekly magazine where they caricatured Takhti with angel wings flying high above the throngs of Iranian mourners at his own funeral with a caption that read \\"Don't cry for me, cry for your own plight.\\" Towfigh magazine was shut down by the Shah for several months after printing this cartoon. He is buried at Ebn-e Babooyeh cemetery in Southern part of Tehran, near Shahr-e Ray, where he is commemorated every year by his fans. After the 1979 political upheaval in Iran, many of the Savak officials, including its chief torturer Bahman Naderipour commonly known by his masked name Mr. Tehrani, were put on trial by the new regime. In an open court hearing published in the then-open newspapers (Keyhaan and Ettela'at were the two most popular outlets reporting the court hearings at the time), Tehrani publicly confessed in the court that Takhti was arrested due to his open support of and collaboration with 'Nehzat Azadi' (Freedom Movement), a moderate anti-government movement lead by Mr. Bazargan and Ayatollah Taleghani during the Shah's rule .. Takhti was survived by his wife and son, Babak Takhti, an author and translator. The movie Takhti, begun by Ali Hatami and finished by Behrooz Afkhami, examined some of the theories about Takhti's death.

The parish comprises the villages of Olveston and Tockington, and the hamlets of Old Down, Ingst and Awkley. The civil parish population at the 2011 census was 2,033. Alveston became a separate parish in 1846. The district has been inhabited since the Stone Age, and the salt marshes that made up almost half of the parish, were progressively drained in Roman and Saxon times. A sea wall was constructed at the same time to prevent flooding from the nearby estuary of the River Severn. The civil parish forms part of the Severn electoral ward. The parish stretches northwards to Hill. The Severn ward population at the 2011 census was 3,628. Church of St. Mary the Virgin The parish church of St Mary the Virgin was built around 1170 and rebuilt in 1370. It was struck by lightning in 1605 and the bells, spire and much of the chancel were destroyed. The tower was rebuilt the following year, and the church has been restored and enlarged in later years. Parish registers survive from 1561. The church contains the funerary brass (dated to 1506), and was the burial place, of Sir Walter Denys (d.1506) and his father Maurice Denys (d.1466), esquire, both lords of the manor, seated at Olveston Court.

It was for a while the seat of the Denys family of nearby Siston who had inherited Olveston manor, together with nearby Alveston, Earthcott Green, Siston and a moiety (1/2) of Aust together with the rights of the Hundred Court of Langley, in 1380 on marriage to Margaret Corbet, granddaughter of Sir Peter Corbet(d.1362) Lord of Caus, Shropshire. In addition to these Gloucestershire lands, the manors of Lawrenny in Pembrokeshire and Hope-juxta-Caus in Shropshire were also inherited.Margaret Corbet had inherited on the death of her brother William, on 25 August 1378. His Inquisition post mortem, taken at Alveston 4/10/1378, lists all these possessions. (cal.inq.p.m. Richard II, vol xv, nos.26‚Äì30, 26:Glos.)Gilbert Denys was similarly possessed per his inq.p.m. taken at Chipping Sodbury 25 June 1422, cal inq.p.m.Henry V no.933. Due to the possibility for confusion between Alveston and Olveston, the Inquisition post mortem of Sir Gilbert Denys, taken at Chipping Sodbury on 25 June 1422, is given here: > Gilbert Denys held of the King in chief in his demesne as of fee by knight > service the manors of Alveston and Earthcott and the Hundred of Langley, > total annual value ¬£19 5s.

The Denys family had lived in Glamorgan, S. Wales during the 13th. & 14th. centuries, most lately at Waterton, near Ewenny Priory, Coity Lordship.Chantler, P. History of the Ancient Family of Dennis of Gloucestershire, South Molton, 2010. The family, it seems, temporarily moved to Olveston Court from Siston in 1422, when the widow of Sir Gilbert Denys(d.1422) obtained Siston as her dower, passing a life interest in it to her younger 2nd. husband John Keymes. Keymes died in 1477, upon which the Denys family regained vacant possession of Siston. However it seems they had become accustomed to Olveston Court since it was in Olveston church that both Maurice Denys(d.1466) and his eldest son Sir Walter Denys(d.1506) were buried, in the middle of the choir (chancel) as the Denys monumental brass (dated 1505) in the church states. The brass states that they were each in succession lord of the manor of Alveston and Irdecote (Earthcott Green). Also probably born at Olveston Court was Maurice's 3rd. son Hugh Denys(d.1511), by his second wife Alice Poyntz, da. of Nicholas Poyntz of Iron Acton. Hugh Denys was Groom of the Stool to King Henry VII, an important figure in the management of the royal and national finances.For the career of Hugh Denys see: Starkey, David, The Virtuous Prince, 2008. Esp. chapter 16 which explains how Denys was vital in facilitating Henry VII's \\"reign of fiscal terror\\". Sir Walter Denys was by Katherine Stradling, da. of Sir Edward Stradling of St. Donat's Castle, Glamorgan, being therefore Hugh Denys's 1/2 brother. On the death of Sir Gilbert Denys in 1422, Stradling had obtained the valuable wardship and marriage of his 12-year-old heir Maurice, whom he had married off to his da. Katherine. Katherine appears to have died very soon after giving birth to Walter. Katherine's mother was Joan Beaufort, the illegitimate da. of Cardinal Henry Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester, a son of John of Gaunt, by Alice FitzAlan, da. of 11th. Earl of Arundel. Beaufort became a member of the regency government on the accession of his infant nephew as Henry VI in 1422. Stradling, probably through the influence of Beaufort, had obtained the licence to marry off his young nephew John Kemeys of Began, Monmouth, to Sir Gilbert Denys's widow, Margaret Russell. It was this latter marriage which forced the Denys family from Siston to reside at Olveston Court until Kemeys's death in 1477. The will of Sir Gilbert DenysNational Archives PROB 11/2B Image ref:413/285 appointed Henry Beaufort as an overseer, perhaps suggesting a connection from Gilbert's early military service under John of Gaunt. In his will Denys had requested his widow to take a vow of chastity, which clearly was made impossible by Sir Edward Stradling who had married her off to John Kemeys within 7 months of Gilbert's death. Non-Conformist Chapels St. Mary's church parish register also includes details of births and burials of Quakers, who had a Meeting House in the village for nearly 200 years. Methodist chapels were built in Olveston (1820), Tockington (1840), Awkley (1856) and Old Down (1933). Colonial Settlements named after Olveston =Montserrat, West Indies= Joseph Sturge (1793‚Äì1859), born in nearby Elberton, was a member of the Quaker Meeting. He purchased a plantation in Montserrat to demonstrate that slavery was unnecessary, and named it Olveston,Olveston and Aust website now a village on the island. =New Zealand= An historic, early 20th century, house in the inner suburbs of Dunedin, New Zealand is named Olveston House, after the birthplace of the original owner. Population and Industry The census of 1851 shows about 50 farms, and that the parish was mainly agricultural up to the time of the Second World War. The associated trades of blacksmith, saddler and carpenter etc. were supplemented by stonemasons and lime burners, there being good quality limestone in the parish. After the mechanisation of farming, and the growth of the aircraft industry at nearby Patchway and Filton, the parish gradually became a home for commuters. The area contains an ancient woodland, Wildacre, owned and operated by the Woodland Trust.

Swimming: Steps to success p. 71 The sidestroke allows the swimmer increased endurance because instead of working both arms and legs simultaneously in the same way, the side stroke uses them simultaneously but differently. A swimmer tired of exercising one side can turn over and use the other, the change of action helping the limbs to recover.Fredrick Warne & Co. Modern Outdoor Amusements pp. 18-19 The hands act like oars, and do not waste any power by oblique action. In ordinary swimming on the right side, the left arm moves gently in the water, almost at rest. Then, when the used arm becomes tired, the swimmer turns on the other side, and the left arm works while the right arm rests. The legs move in opposite directions with legs bent, and straighten as they come together. The kicking motion is exaggerated and slow, opening the legs wide to provide more thrust rather than the small, fast movement of flutter kick.  History  Sidestroke evolved in ancient times from swimmers who discovered that it was painful to swim breaststroke with the head above the water. The head naturally turned onto its side, which led to the shoulder dropping. The scissor kick became natural in this situation.  Modification  A modification of swimming on the side is the Trudgen stroke.Thomas, David G.

It was built in about 1560, rebuilt in the mid-18th century and further remodelled in the early 20th century. Between 1798 and 1938 it was the residence of the Lopes family, Barons Roborough. The house was ruined by fire after World War II, but was restored and converted into apartments in the late 1990s by Kit Martin. It is a grade II* listed building, having been so designated on 29 March 1960. History The Heywood family built an imposing Georgian mansion here in the 1760s. In 1798, the house and estate were bought by the Jamaican-born Manasseh Masseh Lopes, the son of a rich plantation owner, whose family later gained the title of Baron Roborough. The house was extended and altered in 1907. The Lopes remained seated at Maristow until 1938, after which the house served a variety of purposes: a servicemen‚Äôs hospital during World War II; a retirement home for clergy; a residential school, and a field-study centre. Above the house rises the spire of St Martin's chapel, built in 1871 as a successor to an earlier 14th century chapel. Following two disastrous fires, the house has now been restored and converted into twelve private homes. The house The house has an E-shaped plan and consists of two storeys and an attic. It is built of rubble stone which has been rendered, and the dressings are stone. The mansard roof is slated and has a modillion cornice and a balustraded parapet. The wings project forwards from the west front, the three-storey porch being in the centre of the facade. It has large Ionic pilasters and a segmental pediment. The arms of Lopes and an iron balcony top the round-arched doorway. The west front has bays arranged in a 2:3:1:3:2 format, whereas the south front has a 2:3:2 arrangement. The interior was partly gutted by fire in the 20th century, but the 18th century staircase survived as did some of the plasterwork and some 18th century moulded door architraves. The ground floor room in the north-eastern corner of the house has 18th century moulded panelling, a moulded plaster ceiling, overdoors with segmental open pediments, a fireplace with eared architraves, and an overmantel carved with wooden festoons.

In line levelling, short segments of a line are levelled by taking readings through a level from two staffs, one fore and one behind. By chaining together the height differences of these segments, one can compute the total height difference between the end points of a line. The classical work on levelling refraction is that of TJ Kukkam√§ki in 1938‚Äì39. His analysis is based upon the understanding that the measurement beams travel within a boundary layer close to the Earth's surface, which behaves differently from the atmosphere at large. When measuring over a tilted surface, the systematic effect accumulates. The systematic effect of levelling refraction on sloping terrain The Kukkam√§ki levelling refraction became notorious as the explanation of the \\"Palmdale Bulge\\", which geodesists observed in California in the 1970s. Levelling refraction can be eliminated by either of two techniques: # Measuring the vertical temperature gradient within the atmospheric boundary layer. Typically two temperature-dependent resistors are used, one at , the other at height above the ground, mounted on a staff and connected in a Wheatstone bridge. # Using climatological modelling. Depending on the time of day and year, geographical location and general weather conditions, also levelling observations can be approximately corrected for which no original temperature gradient measurements were collected. An alternative, hi-tech approach is dispersometry using two different wavelengths of light. Only recently blue lasers have become readily available making this a realistic proposition.

In 1933, he founded the Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center of New York, a branch of Ramakrishna Mission, and remained its head until his death in 1973. An accomplished writer and thinker, Nikhilananda's greatest contribution was the translation of Sri Sri Ramakrishna Kathamrita from Bengali into English published under the title The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna (1942). Biography Swami Nikhilananda was born in 1895 in Durgapur village, Sylhet district, in present-day Bangladesh (British India) , and had his education in the University of Calcutta. As a graduate he chose the profession of journalism. He then joined the Indian freedom movement and was incarcerated for a period in a British prison camp. As a boy, through his pious parents, he became acquainted with the teachings of Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda. These teachings made an indelible impression on his young mind and brought him in touch with the direct disciples of Ramakrishna. He was initiated by Holy Mother. He also met the direct disciples of Ramakrishna, Swamis Brahmananda, Saradananda, Shivananda, Turiyananda, Premananda, Akhandananda, Abhedananda as well as Mahendranath Gupta, the recorder of Kathamrita among others. After coming into their influence, he abandoned his role as a freedom fighter and renounced the world to join the Ramakrishna Order. As a Brahmachari, for many years he devoted himself to the study of the scriptures under eminent teachers, practised spiritual disciplines, and served the Order in various capacities, until, in 1931, he was deputed by the Order to come to America as one of its representatives. In 1933 he founded the Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center in New York. Nikhilananda was considered a brilliant speaker and was invited to lecture at different universities, churches, and synagogues, and to participate in inter-religious conferences East and West. He served at the Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center till his death in 1973. Nikhilananda made important contributions to the literature of Ramakrishna movement. He also attracted distinguished disciples, including author JD Salinger,The Slate Margaret Woodrow Wilson, daughter of the president Woodrow Wilson, the comparative mythologist Professor Joseph Campbell, and Chester Carlson, inventor of xerographic process. Philosopher Lex Hixon was Nikhilananda's disciple. Literary works His most important works include translations of The Upanishads, The Bhagavad Gita, biographies of Holy Mother and Swami Vivekananda, his compilation of the works of Swami Vivekananda under the title of Vivekananda: The Yogas and Other Works, his two books, Hinduism, Its Meaning for the Liberation of the Spirit, and Man in Search of Immortality, and his many articles written for various journals. His most notable literary work is his translation from original Bengali into English of Kathamrita, published under the title of The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna. Many of the works of Swami Nikhilananda have already been translated into various European and Indian languages and are recognised as authoritative texts on the interpretations of the teachings of Vedanta. In 1944, Time Magazine called Swami Nikhilananda's translations of The Bhagavad Gita, \\"The first really readable, authoritative English translation of one of the world's greatest religious classics.\\" and referred to The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna as \\"translation of one of the world's most extraordinary religious documents.\\" The Gospel was voted as one of the \\"100 Most Important Spiritual Books of the 20th Century\\" by the American scholars convened by Philip Zaleski and HarperCollins publishers, Bibliography * Bhagavad Gita ‚Äì Swami Nikhilananda * Hinduism : Its Meaning for the Liberation of the Spirit ‚Äì Swami Nikhilananda * Holy Mother : life of Holy mother Sri Sarada Devi ‚Äì Swami Nikhilananda * Vivekananda: A Biography ‚Äì Swami Nikhilananda * The Principal Upanishads ‚Äì Swami Nikhilananda * Man in Search of Immortality: Testimonials from the Hindu Scriptures ‚Äì Swami Nikhilananda * Self-Knowledge: Sankara's \\"Atmabodha\\" ‚Äì Swami Nikhilananda * The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna ‚Äì Swami Nikhilananda =Translations= * Gupta, Mahendranath.

The concepts were introduced by William A. Stewart in 1968, and provide a way of distinguishing a language from a dialect.  Definitions  A variety is said to be autonomous if it has an independent cultural status. This may occur if the variety is structurally different from all others, a situation Heinz Kloss called abstand. Thus language isolates such as Basque are necessarily autonomous. Where several closely related varieties are found together, a standard language is autonomous because it has its own orthography, dictionaries, grammar books and literature. In the terminology of Heinz Kloss, these are the attributes of ausbau, or the elaboration of a language to serve as a literary standard. A variety is said to be heteronomous with respect to a genetically related standardized variety if speakers read and write the other variety, which they consider the standard form of their speech, and any standardizing changes in their speech are towards that standard. In such cases, the heteronomous variety is said to be dependent on, or oriented towards, the autonomous one. In the terminology of Heinz Kloss, the heteronomous varieties are said to be under the \\"roof\\" of the standard variety. For example, the various regional varieties of German (so called \\"dialects\\"), such as Alemannic, Austro-Bavarian, Central, Eastern and Northern Hessian, K√∂lsch, Low German, and more, are heteronomous with respect to Standard German, even though many of them are not mutually intelligible. Local dialects of the West Germanic continuum are oriented towards either Standard Dutch or Standard German depending on which side of the border they are spoken. Bordering dialects are generally mutually intelligible, despite their orientation to either standardized variety A dialect continuum may be partitioned by these dependency relationships, which are often determined by extra-linguistic factors. For example, although Germanic varieties spoken on either side of the Dutch‚ÄìGerman border are very similar, those spoken in the Netherlands are oriented towards Standard Dutch, whereas those spoken in Germany are oriented towards Standard German. Within this framework, a language may be defined as an autonomous variety together with all the varieties that are heteronomous with respect to it. Stewart noted that an essentially equivalent definition had been stated by Charles A. Ferguson and John J. Gumperz in 1960. In these terms, Danish and Norwegian, though mutually intelligible to a large degree, are considered separate languages. Conversely, although the varieties of Chinese are mutually unintelligible and have significant differences in phonology, syntax and vocabulary, they may be viewed as comprising a single language because they are all heteronomous with respect to Standard Chinese. Similarly, a heteronomous variety may be considered a dialect of a language defined in this way.  Change of status  Autonomy and heteronomy are largely sociopolitical constructs rather than the result of intrinsic linguistic differences, and thus may change over time. Heteronomous varieties may become dependent on a different standard as a result of social or political changes. For example, the Scanian dialects spoken at the southern tip of Sweden, were considered dialects of Danish when the area was part of the kingdom of Denmark. A few decades after the area was transferred to Sweden, these varieties were generally regarded as dialects of Swedish, although the dialects themselves had not changed. Efforts to achieve autonomy are often connected with nationalist movements and the establishment of nation states. Examples of varieties that have gained autonomy are Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian from Serbo-Croatian and Afrikaans, which was formerly considered a dialect of Dutch. Examples of languages that have previously been considered to be autonomous but are now sometimes considered heteronomous are Occitan, sometimes considered a dialect of French, Low German, occasionally considered to be a dialect of German and Scots with regard to Standard English, though the German linguist Heinz Kloss considered Scots a ('half language') in terms of an abstand and ausbau languages frameworkKloss, Heinz, ¬≤1968, Die Entwicklung neuer germanischer Kultursprachen seit 1800, D√ºsseldorf: Bagel. pp.70, 79 due to its prestigious literary conventions as, for example, described in the 1921 Manual of Modern Scots.Grant, William; Dixon, James Main (1921) Manual of Modern Scots.

They are often described as \\"self-destructing\\", although the disc merely turns black or dark red and does not physically disintegrate. The technology launched in August 2003 as a joint-venture with Disney's Buena Vista Home Entertainment under the name eZ-D. The Flexplay concept was invented by two professors, Yannis Bakos and Erik Brynjolfsson, who founded Flexplay Technologies in 1999. The technology was developed by Flexplay Technologies and General Electric. Origins The technology was originally intended as an alternative means for the short-term rental of newly released movies. Since the disc is capable of being used in any standard DVD player, the manufacturers hoped that it would succeed where other time-limited DVD technologies, such as DIVX, failed. Test marketing of eZ-D discs began on August 2003, but was canceled early when consumers rejected the concept. Owing to fears of cannibalizing DVD sales, movies were made available on eZ-D between 2 months and several years after being released on DVD and were priced at US$6.99, both factors that significantly limited consumer demand. SpectraDisc was another such technology, and on January 13, 2003 Flexplay Technologies acquired all of the SpectraDisc Corporation assets. SpectraDisc discs worked in a similar way as Flexplay discs, only not starting as red and turning blue instead of black. The addition of the red layer to Flexplay discs may be in order to protect the expired discs from being read in next-generation players using blue lasers, for which the oxidized blue-color layer is essentially transparent. Specifications Flexplay discs do not bear the DVD logo. When asked whether Flexplay discs do or do not comply with DVD forum standards, a company spokesperson replied that \\"Flexplay DVDs are produced to be readable in DVD players adhering to DVD Forum specifications.\\" A Flexplay disc is shipped in a vacuum-sealed package. There is a clear dye inside the disc, contained within the bonding resin of the disc, which reacts with oxygen. When the seal is broken on the vacuum-packed disc, the layer changes from clear to black in about 48 hours, rendering the disc unplayable. If unopened, the shelf life of the sealed package is said to be \\"about a year\\". The DVD plastic also has a red dye in it, which prevents penetration of the disc by blue lasers, which would go straight through the oxygen-reactive dye. The Flexplay discs are dual-layer DVD-9 discs. The difference from standard DVDs is the composition of the resin adhesive holding the inner and outer layer together, which is sensitive to oxygen and darkens within a pre-set time, usually 48 hours, when exposed to air. The replacement of the adhesive results in only minimal altering to the DVD manufacturing process. The time of the darkening can be influenced by varying the exact composition of the resin. For the DVD-5 discs, where there is no layer of bonding resin in the optical path, a surface coating can be used. According to the vendor, \\"Flexplay discs are fully recyclable and conform to all applicable EPA environmental standards.\\" Some environmental groups have endorsed the product due to Flexplay's recycling plans and partnership with environmental industry leaders such as GreenDisk, leading to the creation of the first DVD recycling operation. Others such as the Grass Roots Recycling Network nevertheless have objected to the creation of a short-lived \\"disposable\\" version of a traditionally durable product. Chemistry The reactive layer contains a polymer resin that acts as a carrier for a suitable leuco dye, which, upon contact with atmospheric oxygen, oxidizes to form an opaque or semi-opaque material. Some of the dyes used are methylene blue, prussian blue, brilliant cresyl blue, Toluidine Blue O, Basic Blue 3, Methylene Green, Taylor's Blue, Janus Green B, Meldola's Blue, Thionin, Nile Blue, and Celestine Blue. The leuco dye is prepared by chemical reduction using a suitable reducing agent. The method commercially used by Flexplay and SpectraDisc employs methylene blue reduced by sodium dithionite. In order to prevent the oxidation from being triggered during manufacture of the discs, and in order to avoid the need for manufacturing in an inert atmosphere, the leuco dyes are further chemically modified to their blocked forms. Such blocked leuco dyes are the leuco dye precursors that form the leuco dye by a slow, controlled chemical reaction. Leucomethylene blue can be reacted with triisopropylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate, forming triisopropylsilyloxycarbonylleucomethylene blue (TIPSOCLMB), which is stable in presence of air oxygen. In presence of nucleophile reagents, e.g. water, the blocked leuco dye compound undergoes hydrolysis, releasing the unblocked leuco dye. This reaction is slow (several days to a week), and the hydrolytic compound is supplied either as atmospheric moisture, or in the formulation of the resin. The rate of the deblocked leuco dye oxidation is dependent on the pH of the resin polymer matrix. By adding basic compounds (for example, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2] octane (DABCO), or other amines), the pH is increased, and the reaction rate increases correspondingly. Correspondingly, by adding strong protic acids (for example, camphorsulfonic acid), the reaction rate can be decreased and the lifetime of the disc prolonged. The residual oxygen can be removed from the substrates used for disc manufacture by storing them under a vacuum or oxygen free atmosphere (e.g. pure nitrogen) for a period of time (hours to days). Alternatively, an oxygen scavenger (e.g. iron(II) salts, tin(II) salts, or organometallic compounds) can be added to the polymer formulation, reacting with the oxygen present in the polymer matrix in shorter timeframe than the hydrolysis of the blocked leuco dye takes. The reaction timing can be further controlled by addition of other substances. As the diffusion rate of oxygen through the polymer layer is more or less constant, a supply of suitable antioxidants (e.g. organometallic compounds) which react with the oxygen preferentially to the leuco dye leads to gradual depletion of the antioxidant compound. Only after the antioxidant is consumed, the leuco dye starts being oxidized, achieving the period of delay of the reaction onset, followed by a rapid reflectivity degradation. Stannous ethylhexanoate can be used here as the antioxidant organometallic. Various resin-soluble tin(II) and iron(II) compounds can be used, e.g. chelates and fatty acid salts. Other usable compounds are e.g. hydroquinones, alkylhydroxylamines, dithionates, reducing saccharides (e.g. glucose), Œ±-hydroxyketones (e.g., hydroxyacetone), substituted boron hydrides and silicon hydrides. The oxidized dyes in the expired discs absorb primarily at the wavelength of the current diode lasers (red, 650 nm) used in the DVD players. However, the new generation of DVDs is designed to use blue lasers at 450-460 or even 405 nm, for which the methylene blue is essentially transparent. While SpectraDisc did not take this in account, the Flexplay discs incorporate a red color filter, blocking blue lasers from reading the disc, expired or not. Acridine Yellow can be used for this purpose, together with 9,10-bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene, and a scale of different azo dyes, aromatic hydrocarbons, and other dyes. The dyes can be added directly to the polycarbonate resin the discs are made of. Additionally, other methods of the disc degradation are proposed to be deployed together with the primary one; the concern of the technology developers here is that while the dye oxidation mechanism prevents the disc from being read by current consumer technologies, the information on the disc, recorded in the pattern of the pits in the reflective layer, remains intact and could be recovered. One of the methods is to make the two reflective layers in the DVD-9 disc of different metals (e.g. aluminium and silver), and separate them with an ionic conductor separator. The atmospheric oxygen then undergoes electrochemical reaction in such crude fuel cell with the silver as cathode and aluminum as anode, leading to growth of dendritic silver through the dielectric layer. When the silver reaches the aluminium, an electric short circuit forms, and galvanic corrosion then rapidly degrades the reflective layers. Many other mechanisms are proposed for this slower, less controlled \\"backup\\" method of data destruction, ranging from corrosion of the reflective layers to degradation of the polymer matrix of the disc itself. Releases The Disney organization announced in 2003 that it would issue some releases on Flexplay ez-D discs (Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, Bridget Jones' Diary, The Recruit, Rabbit-Proof Fence, The Hot Chick, 25th Hour, Heaven, Equilibrium, Frida and Signs). Discs were test-marketed in Austin, Texas. One grocery chain dropped the discs in February, 2004, saying \\"It didn't turn out to be an item that our customers were looking for.\\" Quote attributed to Susan Ghertner, environmental affairs manager for the Austin- area H-E-B stores. In 2004, Flexplay was purchased by The Convex Group who also own the Lidrock and HowStuffWorks brands. Flexplay discs were priced at around US$4.99, a price comparable to that of a two-day DVD rental. The first Flexplay disc to receive national consumer distribution in the U.S. was a 2004 Christmas movie entitled Noel, which was released \\"trimultaneously\\" to theatres, to cable TV, and to Flexplay disc. Reportedly theatres were angered at the simultaneous release, and as a result the movie actually received screenings in only a few dozen theatres. In June 2008, Flexplay announced that Staples would be selling Flexplay discs in their retail stores.

Introduced in 1999 as the lead and playable character of Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, he was created by Amy Hennig, Seth Carus and Arnold Ayala of Crystal Dynamics. He reappears as the protagonist of Soul Reaver 2, and returns as a playable character alongside series eponym, Kain, in Legacy of Kain: Defiance, which closes his story arc. Portrayed as a tragic hero, Raziel is described as an \\"ex-vampire\\" or \\"wraith\\". First appearing in Soul Reaver as one of Kain's lieutenants, he is executed after surpassing Kain, but is resurrected by The Elder God as a reaver of souls, bent on avenging himself by slaying his brethren and former master. Over the course of this journey, his history is revealed in reverse, and his motivations and loyalties gradually change as he unearths the truth behind his cyclic destiny. Raziel's story and appearance were inspired by several influences, including the 1920 silent film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, John Milton's Paradise Lost, and the Hindu god Vishnu. Outside of the main series, he has featured in two tie-in comics, and in Crystal Dynamics' Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light. In all of his voiced appearances, he has been played by Michael Bell. Video game critics and players have reacted positively to his character, praising his design, backstory and development. Concept and creation The character of Raziel had a precursor in the protagonist of Shifter, a Paradise Lost- inspired game proposal worked on by Crystal Dynamics' Amy Hennig, Seth Carus and Arnold Ayala. During pre-production on Shifter, the development team was asked to adapt the project into a sequel to an earlier Crystal Dynamics- published title which Hennig and Carus had worked on‚ÄîBlood Omen: Legacy of Kain‚Äîand Shifter's main character was reconceptualized as Raziel for the final product, Soul Reaver. His name was derived from that of the homonymous archangel, and his early concept art was influenced by Cesare from The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. Archived on the Wayback Machine Dozens of sketches were produced to shape his final design; the Hindu god Vishnu provided the basis for his blue color, and his wings were intended to evoke those of fallen angels. Raziel is voiced by Michael Bell in all of his appearances. In the series' fictional universe, he is described as an \\"ex-vampire\\", a \\"wraith\\", and a \\"devourer of souls\\",Elder God: Did you think to receive the same favors after your rebellion as before? No, Raziel. I have no need for you to enter the physical world, so no conduit will be granted. You serve me adequately as a wraith, and a wraith you will remain. Elder God: You are changed. Your bloodthirst is replaced by a deeper need ‚Äì you have become a devourer of souls. To sustain your strength, you must hunt the lost spirits of the Underworld, and consume the souls of your enemies. characterized by his skeletal figure, brown cowl, tattered wings and tridactyl claws and feet. Throughout the games, he is required to consume souls to survive, travels between two planes of existence (the material and spectral realms) to solve puzzles, and wields the wraith-blade‚Äîa ghostly version of the Soul Reaver, an ancient sword inhabited by a sentient spirit. The design of his human incarnation in Soul Reaver 2 was inspired by the Roman era. According to Hennig, Raziel's role in the story conforms to that of a tragic hero. While writing dialogue, she considered it important to include character flaws in his personality, enabling him to act as a foil to series protagonist Kain. In Soul Reaver, Raziel is depicted with aspects of both villainy and heroism, and in Soul Reaver 2, Hennig deliberately portrayed him as \\"kind of a self- righteous little twit\\" with a lot to learn. Appearances =In video games= The vampire Raziel, who appears in the opening of Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, was modeled and textured by artists at GlyphX Raziel is introduced in Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver as a vampire sired by the spiritually-corrupted despot Kain‚Äîthe first of Kain's six lieutenants, and his second-in-command. He surpasses Kain, who‚Äîostensibly motivated by jealously‚Äîcondemns Raziel to death.Raziel: I am Raziel, first-born of His lieutenants. I stood with Kain and my brethren at the dawn of the empire. I have served Him a millennium. Over time, we became less human and more... divine. Kain would enter the state of change and emerge with a new gift. Some years after the master, our evolution would follow. Until I had the honor of surpassing my lord. For my transgression, I earned a new kind of reward... agony. There was only one possible outcome ‚Äì my eternal damnation. I, Raziel, was to suffer the fate of traitors and weaklings ‚Äì to burn forever in the bowels of the Lake of the Dead. Raziel is resurrected by The Elder God, and traverses Nosgoth (the fictional setting of the series), embarking on a quest for vengeance.Elder God: You are reborn. The birth of one of Kain's abominations traps the essence of life. It is this soul that animates the corpse you 'lived' in. And that Raziel, is the demise of Nosgoth. There is no balance. The souls of the dead remain trapped. I can not spin them in the wheel of fate. They can not complete their destinies. Redeem yourself. Or if you prefer, avenge yourself. Settle your dispute with Kain. Destroy Him and your brethren. Free their souls and let the wheel of fate churn again. Use your hatred to reave their souls... I can make it possible. Become my soul reaver, my angel of death... He confronts Kain, who attacks him with his legendary blade, the Soul Reaver;Raziel: The Soul Reaver, Kain's ancient blade ‚Äì older than any of us, and a thousand times more deadly. The legends claimed that the blade was possessed, and thrived by devouring the souls of its victims. For all our bravado, we knew what it meant when Kain drew the Soul Reaver in anger ‚Äì it meant you were dead. the Reaver mysteriously shatters when it strikes Raziel. The spirit formerly captive within the sword binds itself to Raziel, becoming his symbiotic weapon‚Äîthe wraith-blade.Elder God: From this moment and ever afterward, you and this blade are inextricably bound. Soul Reaver and reaver of souls, your destinies are intertwined. By destroying the sword, you have liberated it from its corporeal prison, and restored it to its true form ‚Äì a wraith blade, its energy unbound. No longer a physical blade, it can only manifest itself in the material realm when your strength is fully restored. Once manifest, it will sustain you. Raziel discovers that, when they were human, he and the other lieutenants were the leaders of the ancient vampire-hunting Sarafan brotherhood; Kain found their corpses and raised them, unwitting, as vampires, in a calculated act of blasphemous irony.Raziel: These crypts... defiled caskets of Sarafan saints... bearing my brothers' names... And my own... The irony of Kain's blasphemous act rushed in on me with the crushing force of revelation.... Were my hands not as bloody as these? Worse, I had spilled the blood of my brothers ‚Äì these very comrades whose tombs lay ravaged before me. / Elder God: Yes, Raziel ‚Äì you were Sarafan... born of the same force that all but destroyed your race. Before the dawn of the Empire, you were chosen. Kain ‚Äì Nosgoth's solitary, self-declared monarch ‚Äì plundered this tomb and raised you from these crypts. Breathing his vampiric gift into your defiled corpses, he resurrected you as his favored sons. Raziel kills Kain's remaining lieutenants and tracks him down again, but is cheated of revenge when Kain activates a time machine and slips into Nosgoth's past.Kain: You nearly had me, Raziel... But this is not where ‚Äì or how ‚Äì it ends. Fate promises more twists before this drama unfolds completely. / Elder God: Be warned, Raziel ‚Äì once you cross this threshold, you are beyond my influence... / Moebius: Raziel... Redeemer and destroyer... pawn and messiah. Welcome, time-spanned soul... Welcome... to your destiny... In Soul Reaver 2, while in pursuit of Kain, Raziel explores the past, learning more of his own history as a former member of the Sarafan, and discovering Kain's ultimate goal‚Äîto restore balance to Nosgoth.Raziel: For the first time, I beheld the image of my Sarafan self, memorialized here among my fallen comrades. It tortured me to see how noble and pure I had been ‚Äì and what a vile phantasm I had become. And a profound sense of injury ‚Äì of loss and betrayal ‚Äì welled up in me, so overwhelming I could barely contain it. All I wanted at this moment was to find Kain, and destroy him. Kain: If you truly believe in free will, Raziel, now is the time to prove it. Kill me now, and we both become pawns of history, dragged down the path of an artificial destiny. I was ordained to assume the role of Balance Guardian in Nosgoth, while you were destined to be its savior. But the map of my fate was redrawn by Moebius, and so in turn was yours... Kain had Raziel executed in Soul Reaver in order to create a temporal paradox. By exploiting Raziel's unique free will, Kain can defy the course of history and alter time.Kain: All but one. Because of your re-making, you are the one unbound creature, the one among us all that truly has free will. You have a choice, Raziel ‚Äì Kain: History abhors a paradox, Raziel. Even now, the time-stream strains to divert itself, finding its old course blocked by your refusal to destroy me. The future is reshuffling itself to accommodate your monumental decision. In hopes of learning more about his destiny, Raziel time travels back to the era of the Sarafan, where the ancient vampire Janos Audron gifts him the Reaver‚Äîa younger version of the Soul Reaver blade, before it housed a ravenous spirit. However, they are ambushed by the Sarafan leaders, including Raziel's former self, who slays Janos.Raziel: I would pursue the Sarafan dogs to their loathsome fortress, and avenge Janos Audron's murder. Moebius would pay dearly for his treachery, and my Sarafan brethren would reap the horrors they had sown. I would retake the stolen Reaver, which was rightfully mine. And finally, when all these debts had been paid, I would reclaim Janos Audron's heart from their filthy, unworthy hands. If the heart was truly imbued with the power to restore vampiric unlife, its highest purpose was clear to me... I would restore the heart to Janos, and thus undo the vile crime committed by my abominable former self. Raziel renounces his heritage by using the Reaver to kill his former comrades and his younger self, thus providing the corpses for Kain to turn into vampires in the future.Raziel: My former brethren Dumah and Rahab confronted me next ‚Äì this all seemed so elegantly choreographed. Exhilarated by the Reaver, I was drunk with revelations... I could finally appreciate the delicious irony of Kain's blasphemous, private joke ‚Äì and I reveled as I colluded with him across the centuries. For it was I who put these bastards in their tomb ‚Äì thus providing the corpses for Kain to raise as his vampire sons a millennium from now. The Reaver then turns against Raziel, and he realizes that the entity destined to become trapped within the blade has always been him; the sword shattered against him in Soul Reaver because it could not consume its own soul.Raziel: With all other foes exhausted, the conjoined blades turned themselves on me. And I realized, finally, why I had sensed nothing when Janos offered me the blade. The Reaver was never forged to be a soul-stealing weapon... the ravenous, soul-devouring entity trapped in the blade was ‚Äì and always had been ‚Äì me. This is why the blade was destroyed when Kain tried to strike me down ‚Äì the Reaver could not devour its own soul. The paradox shattered the blade. So ‚Äì this was my terrible destiny ‚Äì to play out this purgatorial cycle for all eternity... I could not bear it ‚Äì despair overwhelmed me. Kain saves Raziel from being absorbed by the Reaver, but this causes a temporal paradox which changes Nosgoth's history for the worse, and only postpones Raziel's fate.Raziel: Behind Kain's eyes, I could see new memories blooming and dying, as history labored to reshuffle itself around this monumental obstruction... And I could see by the dawning horror on his face that perhaps we had strained history too far this time... that by trying to alter my fate, he may have introduced a fatal paradox. In Legacy of Kain: Defiance, Raziel discovers that it was prophesied in the distant past that two champions would battle to decide the fate of Nosgoth.Kain: Here, no doubt, was the evidence Moebius wished me to have... For the Vampires had prophesied not one, but two champions ‚Äì one destined to be Nosgoth's redeemer, the other, its destroyer. The Vampires' hero wielded the Reaver, forged for this very purpose. His opponent was clearly the hero of their adversaries ‚Äì the Hylden ‚Äì and brandished a flaming sword. The foretold outcome was unambiguous: the Vampire hero would fall. Raziel seeks to revive Janos, but learns that he must kill Kain to do so.Raziel: Kain. You used the Heart of Darkness to create Kain. / Mortanius: How else? I refused at first to believe the ancient myths. I thought the vampires were simply a plague upon mankind, a pestilence we had to control. But they were right, and we were wrong to overthrow them - Moebius and I. We didn't understand what it was the Pillars were holding back. I have made my atonement. I will continue to make it to the end, which will be soon, now. But I know - Kain will set it right, he will restore Balance ‚Äî Coaxed into believing that they are the champions, Raziel and Kain fight, with Raziel the victor.Raziel: And will that knowledge sustain you? You too are going to your death. / Moebius: For a true servant of the one God, death is never bitter. I will go ‚Äì again at peace with the knowledge that I have played my small part in our master's plans. Kain is at last destroyed, and you have carried out the deed. Which hero do you think you are now? The vampire savior? Or the other one? Have you realized yet that it didn't matter to us which one either of you thought you were, so long as the result was the same in the end? And now, Kain is dead. Really, I cannot thank you enough. He resurrects Janos, who enables him to enhance the wraith-blade with spiritual powers, but to little avail; Raziel is trapped by The Elder God.Janos: This token is the key to the mysteries you seek. I cannot accompany you; you must face this trial alone. If you prevail, you will have your answers. / Raziel: And if I fail the test? / Janos: Then you will not return. Ariel: Yes, Raziel ‚Äì yet I am much more than I was. The veil is lifted from my sight. My spirit, united with the souls of my predecessors, is drawn here now for the final baptism of the blade. To restore Balance, the sword must be rendered pure by Spirit. Release me, Raziel ‚Äì the Soul Reaver has the power. Release us all. For this we were called. While in captivity, he reaches the epiphany that he is both champions (Kain was neither); his free will allows him to determine Nosgoth's ultimate future. He reflects that the Elder is the cause of all the conflict and strife throughout history, and when Kain re-emerges, alive, with the Reaver, Raziel reconciles with him and willingly surrenders to the sword.Raziel: All the conflict and strife throughout history, all the fear and hatred, served but one purpose - to keep my master's Wheel turning. All souls were prisoners, trapped in the pointless round of existence, leading distracted, blunted lives until death returned them - always in ignorance - to the Wheel. Raziel: The Soul Reaver ‚Äì pure of all corruption ‚Äì this is what it is for. This is what I am for ‚Äì The two become one ‚Äì both Soul Reavers ‚Äì together ‚Äì and the Scion of Balance is healed. And I ‚Äì am not your enemy ‚Äì not your destroyer ‚Äì I am, as before, your right hand. Your sword. / Kain: No, Raziel ‚Äì this can't be the way... / Raziel: And now you will see ‚Äì the true enemy ‚Äì Before his soul is consumed, he disperses the wraith-blade into Kain, simultaneously curing Kain's corruption, dooming himself to thousands of years of torment in the Reaver, and releasing his future self from that same imprisonment. Kain uses the newly created Soul Reaver to battle The Elder God, and concludes that Raziel's sacrifice has offered him hope.Kain: Now, at last, the masks had fallen away. The strings of the puppets had become visible, and the hands of the prime mover exposed. Most ironic of all was the last gift that Raziel had given me, more powerful than the sword that now held his soul, more acute even than the vision his sacrifice had accorded me ‚Äì the first bitter taste of that terrible illusion: Hope. =In merchandise and promotion= Several action figures and figurines of Raziel have been created by Blue Box Interactive and the NECA in partnership with Eidos. He was also featured in Top Cow's promotional comics for Soul Reaver and Defiance, and appears alongside Kain as a playable character in downloadable content (DLC) for 2010's Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light. Reception Received positively by players and the gaming press, Raziel was praised by GameSpot's Greg Kasavin, who wrote in his review Defiance that \\"it's rare enough to find a truly memorable main character in a game, let alone two\\", and closed deeming the title \\"one of those rare games whose characters and story to some extent supersede the problems in the gameplay\\". Official UK PlayStation Magazine welcomed Raziel's debut in Soul Reaver, showcasing him on the cover of issue 43; his story and in-game appearance were endorsed, and in a comparison with Tomb Raider III, his free-flowing character animation was described as making \\"Lara look like a glove puppet\\". Reviewing the Dreamcast port of Soul Reaver, IGN's Jeremy Dunham described Raziel's narrative as one of the most convincing he had ever heard, echoed later in the site's review for Legacy of Kain: Defiance, which described the series' cast as \\"just damn good at talking like vampires, tortured souls and gods.\\" GameSpot included Soul Reaver in a 1999 list of ten computer games with the best voice acting of all time, stating about Bell that \\"you'd never guess that the same person carried out all those voices\\", and of the cast \\"there's not one weak link in the bunch, and together they create one of the best examples of voice acting in a game for PC or consoles.\\" In contrast, Douglass C. Perry of IGN felt Raziel's (and Kain's) dialogue in Soul Reaver 2 was overdone, stating that \\"overwritten text makes them sound like caffeine-imbued English students verbally jousting in their first semester in college,\\" but liked the advancement and rebalancing of Raziel's personality and aggressiveness, and enjoyed his depiction, stating that he \\"looks magnificently decripid .\\" Alongside Kain, Raziel was selected by IGN's readers as one of ten heroes most wanted to appear in the 2008 fighting game Soulcalibur IV, and was ranked ninth on Electronic Gaming Monthlys list of top ten badass undead that same year. In 2009, he was inducted into Diehard GameFANs list of top ten video game vampires (dubbed as \\"Not A Vampire #2\\"), and was included as one of GameSpot's 64 All Time Greatest Game Heroes (where he, however, lost in the first round of user voting elimination to Donkey Kong), while Thunderbolt ranked him as ninth on their list of the top videogame antiheroes.

While this yields twelve possible isomers, all of them are satisfactory despite slight differences in their properties. Basic fuchsine Basic fuchsine is a mixture of rosaniline, pararosaniline, new fuchsine and Magenta II.Horobin RW & Kiernan JA 20002. Conn's Biological Stains, 10th ed. Oxford: BIOS, p. 184‚Äì191 Formulations usable for making of Schiff reagent must have high content of pararosanilin. The actual composition of basic fuchsine tends to somewhat vary by vendor and batch, making the batches differently suitable for different purposes. In solution with phenol (also called carbolic acid) as an accentuator it is called carbol fuchsin and is used for the Ziehl‚ÄìNeelsen and other similar acid-fast staining of the mycobacteria which cause tuberculosis, leprosy etc.Clark G 1973 Staining Procedures Used by the Biological Stain Commission, 3rd ed. Baltimore: Williams & Wilkins, pp. 252‚Äì254 Basic fuchsine is widely used in biology to stain the nucleus, and is also a component of Lactofuchsin, used for Lactofuchsin mounting. Properties Basic fuchsine pieces. The two magenta stains on the paper were made by placing one drop of ethanol-water azeotrope, centre, and water, right, on the streaks remaining on the paper after the 'crystals' were removed. The 'crystals' were then replaced and the photograph taken. The crystals pictured at the right are of basic fuchsine, also known as basic violet 14, basic red 9, pararosanaline or CI 42500. Their structure differs from the structure shown above by the absence of the methyl group on the upper ring, otherwise they are quite similar. They are soft, with a hardness of less than 1, about the same as or less than talc. They possess a strong metallic lustre and a green yellow color. They leave dark greenish streaks on paper and when these are moistened with a solvent, the strong magenta colour appears. Chemical structure Fuchsine is an amine salt and has three amine groups, two primary amines and a secondary amine. If one of these is protonated to form ABCNH+, the positive charge is delocalized across the whole symmetrical molecule due to pi cloud electron movement. The positive charge can be thought of as residing on the central carbon atom and all three \\"wings\\" becoming identical aromatic rings terminated by a primary amine group. Other resonance structures can be conceived, where the positive charge \\"moves\\" from one amine group to the next, or one third of the positive charge resides on each amine group. The ability of fuchsine to be protonated by a stronger acid gives it its basic property. The positive charge is neutralized by the negative charge on the chloride ion. The positive \\"basic fuchsinium ions\\" and negative chloride ions stack to form the salt \\"crystals\\" depicted above.

As of the 2011 census, its population was 25,912 (including 12,884 men and 13,028 women).http://www.sci.org.ir/SitePages/report_90/ostani/ostani_population_report_final_permision.aspx The inhabitants are Persian-speaking. Tafresh is located amidst high mountains southwest of Tehran. The flight distance between Tehran and Tafresh is 170 km towards southwest. The average altitude of Tafresh is 1912 meters above sea level, with a continental and semi-arid climate with an annual rainfall of 270 mm. Despite its small size Tafresh is known in Iran for being the cradle of science, literature, culture and art, as well as a land of mountains and plains, springs and waterfalls.  History  Tafresh, also called Tabres in historical sources, is believed to be one of the oldest regions in the present Markazi province and constituted a Zoroastrian stronghold in antiquity. A famous general by the name Delaram of Tafresh fought in the defense of Sasanian Iran during the Islamic conquest and has given name to the village Delaram nearby Tafresh. Today the village is also called Teraran. There are fifty historical monuments in Tafresh that have been listed as part of Iranian national heritage. These include ruins of Zoroastrian places of worship and burial sites (so-called dakhmas) in and around the town, particularly on the summits of the surrounding mountains and hills. There are also remains of Zoroastrian dakhmas in nearby villages, such as in Kaburan and Khalchal. The father of the Persian poet Nezami Ganjavi, writer of numerous romantic epics, was born in Tafresh.  Learning and culture  artistic metalworking Ab Anbar-e Bolur in Tafresh. Tafresh has provided Iran with many notable figures such as poets, ministers, statesmen, scientists and calligraphers, especially from Qajar times and onwards. The Qajar statesmen Amir Kabir and Ghasem Magham Farahani hailed from the Tafresh Province. The strong tradition of learning reassured the early establishment of modern schools in the early 20th century. Famous scientists from Tafresh include Mahmoud Hessaby, the father of modern physics in Iran, Ahmad Parsa, the father of Iranian botanics, Abbas Sahab, the father of cartography in Iran, Mohammad Gharib, the father of pediatrics in Iran, and Abdolkarim Gharib, the father of modern geology in Iran. For this reason Tafresh has received the nickname \\"City of Iran's Fathers\\" (Shahr-e pedarƒÅn-e IrƒÅn). The city has preserved its position as an important Iranian scientific and literary center in the 21st century due to its modern universities. The village of Delaram, with a population today of about 250 people, is famous as the \\"Village of physicians\\" (Dehkade-ye pezeshkƒÅn) since it has produced more than 175 physicians.  Traditional handicrafts  Tafresh is famous for its traditional carpet weaving and artistic metalworking. The Tafresh carpet is of the Hamadan type but the quality is finer than the average production of that area.

It is east of Penryn and south of Truro.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 204 Truro & Falmouth It faces Falmouth across the Penryn River, an arm of the Carrick Roads. The village is known for its yearly Regatta week in July. Flushing lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Almost a third of Cornwall has AONB designation, with the same status and protection as a National Park. History The village was founded in 1661; there is disagreement about whether there are any houses of the late 17th century.Clonmore and Clinton House are said to be 17th century by Nikolaus Pevsner, but he quotes the opinion of Lady Redwood that they are 18th. 22 Treyew Road and New Quay House are also of architectural interest according to her.--Pevsner, N. (1970) Cornwall; 2nd ed., revised by Enid Radcliffe. Harmondsworth: Penguin; p. 69, 69n Originally named Nankersey, meaning valley of the reed swamp, the village was given its name by Dutch engineers from Flushing in the Netherlands who built the three main quays in the village. The grand houses on St Peter's Hill, the road that leads into the village, were owned by captains of the packet ships (mail-boats) that docked in nearby Falmouth. James Silk Buckingham (1786‚Äì1855) spent his childhood here and writes that most of the Packet captains and officers, and their families, as well as the crews lived in the village. Dinners, balls and evening parties were held most evenings at some of the captains' houses and there were dances for the sailors at the more humble places. Much of it paid for by prize money and the profits from the contraband carried by the Packet ships. Henry VIII intended to build a castle on Trefusis Point, to accompany those built at Pendennis and St. Mawes, but due to the expensive wars was unable to finance it. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the village's economy mainly relied upon fishing, the two farms and former manors of Trefusis (the original seat of the Trefusis family,Vivian, J. L., The Visitations of Cornwall: comprising the Heralds' Visitations of 1530, 1573 & 1620; with additions by J.L. Vivian, Exeter, 1887, pedigree of \\"Trefusis of Trefusis\\", pp.463-8 Barons Clinton since 1791) and Tregew, together with Falmouth Docks. There was also briefly a copper mine on Jericho beach, but extracting the copper proved commercially unviable. Now Flushing is principally a commuter village for the nearby towns of Penryn, Falmouth and Truro, although some commercial fishing vessels are still based in the village. There are also several B&Bs; to cater for tourists; many houses in the village now lie unoccupied for most of the year as they are used as holiday homes. Housing and amenities Most of Flushing's 670 residents live in the centre of the village, on Coventry Road, Kersey Road and St Peter's Hill, although there is limited housing along Trefusis Road out as far as Kiln Beach, and there are also some houses near Trefusis Farm near the border with Mylor Bridge. The doctor's surgery is located in the Village Hall. There are two pubs, the Royal Standard on St Peter's Hill and the Seven Stars on Trefusis Road opposite Fish Cross. There is also a fish restaurant on Ferry Quay. Churches and schools ;Anglican church St Peter's Church, Flushing Flushing parish church (Anglican) is located on St Peter's Road and is dedicated to Saint Peter. It is built in the Norman style and was opened for divine worship in February 1842 (consecrated: August 1842). St Peter's was renovated in 1871 by subscriptions collected by Capt Nevill Norway RN, when a vestry was added. It is now a Grade II listed building. The parish is part of a united benefice with the parish of Mylor in the Archdeaconry of Cornwall and Diocese of Truro. There is a Cornish cross in the churchyard. It was found in a farm building at Porloe in 1891 and moved to the churchyard. The head has a crude crucifixus figure on the front and a Latin cross on the back.Langdon, A. G. (1896) Old Cornish Crosses. Truro: Joseph Pollard; pp. 287‚Äì89 ;Methodist church The Methodist chapel is located in Kersey Road and, built in 1816, is the oldest building in the Falmouth and Gwennap circuit. There was also a Bible Christian chapel in Kersey Road (built in 1833) and a Primitive Methodist chapel in Coventry Road (built in 1866). In its 200th anniversary year (2016) the chapel was closed for public worship owing to declining membership. The chapel has now been declared as \\"purpose fulfilled\\" while community leaders ‚Äì supported by the Methodist Circuit ‚Äì seek a new use for the building. The chapel organ, lectern, gallery pulpit, baptismal fount, many smaller artefacts, two marble wall memorials, several brass memorial plates, some original 1816 seating and the entire contents of the Sunday School have all been preserved. Several original oil lamps from the 1866 Primitive Methodist Chapel in Coventry Road are also preserved. The Trustees gifted these objects, and a carved communion table with chairs from the demolished Pike's Hill Methodist chapel in Falmouth, to The Cornish Heritage Collection at Poldark Mine, 11 miles from Flushing, and they were moved there in 2016. The pipe organ is in working order and may be played by visitors. ;Schools The village Church of England school is in Coventry Road and caters for a maximum of eighty pupils. It serves as a feeder school for the local secondary school, Penryn College, although some pupils have gone on to Penair School in Truro or the fee-paying Truro School and Truro High School for Girls. Due to its cramped location in the middle of the village it has no playing field or school hall; organised games are held on the Bowling Green at the top of the village, and school meals and plays take place in the Village Hall on Coventry Road. Culture Flushing harbour from Fish Strand Quay, Falmouth Houses in Flushing, from Fish Strand Quay, Falmouth Flushing Regatta Week is held annually during late July or early August, and features water- based activities such as bathtub racing, rowing, swimming and sailing races, sand-castle building contests, a mini-marathon through Mylor and Flushing, an open-air church service, a pub quiz, crab catching, and a carnival on Saturday night, and has achieved marked popularity locally. Every year, two residents of Flushing who have contributed to the life of the village over a period of time are selected to be the Presidents; their responsibilities include judging competitions and opening events. The Nankersey Male Choir perform regular concerts throughout the year, raising money for local good causes, and classical concerts and recitals are often held in the Methodist chapel. The village has two gig clubs, Nankersey Rowing Club and Flushing & Mylor Pilot Gig Club. Due to its position, Flushing is said to be one of the warmest villages in the United Kingdom.\\"Flushing ... said to enjoy the mildest climate in England\\"--Ward, C. S. & Baddeley, M. J. B.

A typical ETC system consists of three major components: (i) an accelerator pedal module (ideally with two or more independent sensors), (ii) a throttle valve that can be opened and closed by an electric motor (sometimes referred to as an electric or electronic throttle body (ETB)), and (iii) a powertrain or engine control module (PCM or ECM).Garrick, R.D., Sensitivity of Contact Electronic Throttle Control Sensor to Control System Variation, Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Technical Paper, 2006-01-0763, April 2006. http://delphi.com/pdf/techpapers/2006-01-0763.pdf The ECM is a type of electronic control unit (ECU), which is an embedded system that employs software to determine the required throttle position by calculations from data measured by other sensors, including the accelerator pedal position sensors, engine speed sensor, vehicle speed sensor, and cruise control switches. The electric motor is then used to open the throttle valve to the desired angle via a closed-loop control algorithm within the ECM. The benefits of electronic throttle control are largely unnoticed by most drivers because the aim is to make the vehicle power-train characteristics seamlessly consistent irrespective of prevailing conditions, such as engine temperature, altitude, and accessory loads. Electronic throttle control is also working 'behind the scenes' to dramatically improve the ease with which the driver can execute gear changes and deal with the dramatic torque changes associated with rapid accelerations and decelerations. Electronic throttle control facilitates the integration of features such as cruise control, traction control, stability control, and precrash systems and others that require torque management, since the throttle can be moved irrespective of the position of the driver's accelerator pedal. ETC provides some benefit in areas such as air-fuel ratio control, exhaust emissions and fuel consumption reduction, and also works in concert with other technologies such as gasoline direct injection. A criticism of the very early ETC implementations was that they were \\"overruling\\" driver decisions. Nowadays, the vast majority of drivers have no idea how much intervention is happening. Much of the engineering involved with drive-by-wire technologies including ETC deals with failure and fault management. Many ETC systems have redundant pedal and throttle position sensors and controller redundancy, even as complex as independent microprocessors with independently written software within a control module whose calculations are compared to check for possible errors and faults.  Failure modes  There is no mechanical linkage between the accelerator pedal and the throttle valve with electronic throttle control. Instead, the position of the throttle valve (i.e., the amount of air in the engine) is fully controlled by the ETC software via the electric motor. But just opening or closing the throttle valve by sending a new signal to the electric motor is an open loop condition and leads to inaccurate control. Thus, most if not all current ETC systems use closed loop feedback systems, such as PID control, whereby the ECU tells the throttle to open or close a certain amount. The throttle position sensor(s) are continually read and then the software makes appropriate adjustments to reach the desired amount of engine power. There are two primary types of throttle position sensors (TPS): a potentiometer or a non-contact sensor Hall Effect sensor (magnetic device). A potentiometer is a satisfactory way for non-critical applications such as volume control on a radio, but as it has a wiper contact rubbing against a resistance element, dirt and wear between the wiper and the resistor can cause erratic readings. The more reliable solution is the magnetic coupling, which makes no physical contact, so will never be subject to failing by wear. This is an insidious failure as it may not provide any symptoms until there is total failure. All cars having a TPS have what is known as a 'limp-home-mode'. When the car goes into the limp-home-mode it is because the accelerator and engine control computer and the throttle are not talking to each other in a way that they can understand. The engine control computer shuts down the signal to the throttle position motor and a set of springs in the throttle set it to a fast idle, fast enough to get the transmission in gear but not so fast that driving may be dangerous. Software or electronic failures within the ETC have been suspected by some to be responsible for alleged incidents of unintended acceleration. A series of investigations by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) were unable to get to the bottom of all of the reported incidents of unintended acceleration in 2002 and later model year Toyota and Lexus vehicles. A February 2011 report issued by a team from NASA (which studied the source code and electronics for a 2005 Camry model, at the request of NHTSA) did not rule out software malfunctions as a potential cause. In October 2013, the first jury to hear evidence about Toyota's source code (from expert witness Michael Barr (software engineer)) found Toyota liable for the death of a passenger in a September 2007 unintended acceleration collision in Oklahoma.

Most recently from February 2020 he has helped the DGWHO deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.  Early life and education  Nabarro is the son of the late Sir John David Nunes Nabarro‚Äîwhose cousin was the late Sir Gerald Nabarro, MP‚Äîformerly consultant endocrinologist at University College Hospital (UCH) and Middlesex Hospital, London. He attended Oundle School in Northamptonshire, leaving in the summer of 1966. In a gap year between school and university, Nabarro was a community service volunteer. He spent a year as the organiser of Youth Action, York. A BBC television documentary was made about his volunteer work. Nabarro studied at the University of Oxford and the University of London, and qualified as a physician in 1973. He is a member of the Faculty of Public Health (FPH) and the Royal College of Physicians by distinction (where he is also a Fellow). Career = Early career = Nabarro worked as a medical officer in North Iraq for Save the Children, before joining the United Kingdom's (UK) National Health Service (NHS) for a short time. From 1976 to 1978, Nabarro worked as District Child Health Officer in Dhankuta District, Nepal. Later, he moved to the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and in 1982, he became Regional Manager for the Save the Children Fund in South Asia, based in the region. In 1985 he joined the University of Liverpool Medical School as senior lecturer in International Community Health. He moved to the Overseas Development Administration (now the Department for International Development) as a strategic adviser for health and population in East Africa, based in Nairobi, in 1989. Nabarro later took up the post of chief health and population adviser at the Overseas Development Administration (London office) in 1990, and moved on to become director of human development (as well as chief health adviser) in 1997. =World Health Organization (1999‚Äì2005)= Nabarro joined the WHO in January 1999, as project manager of Roll Back Malaria, then moved to the Office of the DG as executive director in March 2000. In this capacity, he worked with DGWHO Gro Harlem Brundtland for two years on a variety of issues, including the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, Health Systems Assessments and the creation of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. As part of this work, he became for 1999-2001 a member of the board of directors of Medicines for Malaria Venture.http://www.mmv.org/sites/default/files/uploads/docs/publications/MMV_10th_Anniversary_Book_5.pdf Nabarro transferred to the Sustainable Development and Healthy Environments cluster in 2003 and was appointed representative of the DG for health action in crises in July 2003. Nabarro was stationed in the Canal Hotel in Baghdad, Iraq, when it was bombed on the afternoon of 19 August 2003. The blast targeted the UN, which had used the hotel as its headquarters in Iraq since 1991. He has also coordinated support for health aspects of crisis response operations in Darfur, Sudan, and in countries affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and Tsunami. = UN System senior coordinator (2005‚Äì2014) = In September 2005, Nabarro was seconded from WHO and appointed senior UN system coordinator for avian and human influenza by secretary-general of the UN Kofi Annan to ensure that the UN system made an effective and coordinated contribution to the global effort to control the epidemic of avian influenza (also known as 'bird flu'). = Coordinator of Global Food Security (HLTF) (2008‚Äì2014) = In January 2009, Nabarro took on the responsibility of coordinating the UN system's High-Level Task Force on Global Food Security (HLTF). The HLTF brought together 23 different organizations, funds, programs and other entities from within the UN family, as well as the Bretton Woods Institutions, the World Trade Organization (WTO), and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and tasked them with establishing a common strategy for addressing food and nutrition insecurity in a more sustainable, coordinated and comprehensive way. Nabarro left the HLTF coordinator position in 2014 and was succeeded by Giuseppe Fantozzi. = Special representative of the UN Secretary-General (2009‚Äì2017) = Nabarro addresses global food security crisis at Global Commodities Forum, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development In November 2009 UN Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon appointed Nabarro as special representative on food security and nutrition. As special representative, Nabarro's role was to: * Align UN system action on people's food security, livelihood resilience and sustainable agriculture in the face of changing climates * Support functioning of the Committee on World Food Security * Oversee UN Secretary-General's Zero Hunger Challenge = Coordinator of nutrition movement (2010‚Äì2015) = In September 2010, Nabarro was appointed coordinator of the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement. SUN brings together government officials, civil society, the UN, donors, businesses and researchers in a collective effort to improve nutrition. Betimes, he became Member of the WHO Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity (2016), 2013‚Äì2014. = Special envoy on Ebola (2014‚Äì15) = David Nabarro speaks at World Organization for Animal Health In August 2014, Nabarro was designated as special envoy of the UN Secretary-General on Ebola, with the responsibility for ensuring that the UN system makes an effective and coordinated contribution to the global effort to control the outbreak of Ebola. The epidemic is believed to have begun in December 2013 with the death of a 2-year-old boy in a remote area of Guinea, but was not recognized until March 2014. For several months the epidemic was spreading. This is something that public health experts in the affected locations, such as Medecins Sans Fronti√®res (Doctors Without Borders), claimed was due to a deeply flawed and delayed response by health and government officials. In an interview later in 2015, once Ebola had largely been brought under control, Nabarro said that when he started working on Ebola in 2014, he \\"was aware that we were in the middle of a disease outbreak of enormous proportions. The number of people getting sick was doubling every week. Facilities were completely overloaded. Communities were in a state of despair.\\" He added that the international community had learned important lessons from the epidemic: \\"The world is going to be different as a result of this Ebola outbreak, much more confident, much more assured, and much, much more capable to ensure the well-being of its citizens.\\" = Chair of the Advisory Group on Reform at WHO (2015‚Äì16) = Nabarro was responsible for leading a high-level advisory group to guide reform of WHO's response to outbreaks and emergencies, prepare reports based on the group's recommendations and advise on the manner of their implementation. = Head of UN's response to cholera in Haiti (2016‚Äì17) = In 2016 Nabarro was tapped to lead the UN's response to Haiti's cholera epidemic. Cholera had killed more than 10,000 Haitians in the six years since the disease was introduced by UN peacekeepers in 2010. After UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon issued a long overdue apology for the UN's \\"role\\" in the epidemic, Nabarro oversaw efforts to raise $400 million from UN member states to fund the Secretary General's proposed \\"New Approach\\" to cholera in Haiti. Nabarro was the second UN appointee to work on the cholera crisis in Haiti. Pedro Modrano Rojas previously served as a senior coordinator for the cholera effort, but left at the end of an 18-month term, stating that he was disappointed by the international community's \\"failure to acknowledge the fact that we have in Haiti the largest epidemic in the western hemisphere.\\" Nabarro's efforts were no more successful‚Äîas a result of a lack of support from the UN Secretary General and from member states, Nabarro was only been able to raise $2.7 million of the promised $400 million before being replaced by Josette Sheeran‚Äîthough Sheeran would face the same obstacles as Nabarro. = Special adviser on Sustainable Development and Climate Change (2016‚Äì17) = In January 2016, Nabarro was appointed special adviser on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by then UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. One of Nabarro's responsibilities in this role were to lead the UN's response to the cholera epidemic its peacekeepers sparked in Haiti in October 2010 when untreated, infected sewage from a UN base was deposited in the country's main river system. As of August 2016, at least 10,000 people had died and more than 800,000 have been sickened in the epidemic. = Candidate for WHO Director- General (2016‚Äì17) = In September 2016, Nabarro was nominated by the UK's First May ministry to stand for the post of director-general (DG) of the World Health Organization (WHO). An article co-authored by the UK's chief medical officer, Sally Davies, was published in The Lancet. It outlined the criteria that the next DG of the WHO must fulfill. Nabarro was one of six candidates put forward by their individual governments to succeed DGWHO Margaret Chan. Nabarro outlined his four priorities as follows: # Alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals # Transforming the WHO to respond to outbreaks and health emergencies # Trusted engagement with Member States # Advancing people-centred health policies. On Tuesday 23 May, at the 70th World Health Assembly, Nabarro came second in the race to become the next director general, receiving 50 votes to Dr Tedros Adhanom's 133 in the third and final round of voting. = Imperial College London Professor (2018-present) = In 2018 he was appointed Professor at the Institute of Global Health Innovation at Imperial College London and then appointed in 2019 as Co-Director with surgeon Ara Darzi, Baron Darzi of Denham. = COVID-19 pandemic = On 21 February 2020, he was appointed as one of six Special Envoys from the DGWHO, who were tasked to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Population: It was previously known as Beloozero (until 1777). History Known as Beloozero (, lit. white lake) until 1777, it was first chronicled in 862 as one of the five original Russian towns (the other four being Murom, Novgorod, Polotsk, and Rostov). According to the Primary Chronicle, Sineus, a brother of Rurik, became the prince of Beloozero in 862. However, Sineus most likely never existed. On several occasions, the settlement was moved from one bank of the lake to another. In the 11th century, the region was still inhabited primarily by Finno-Ugric tribes who fiercely resisted Christianization. In 1071, local pagan priests rose in rebellion, which was put down by the Kievan commander Yan Vyshatich. The Primary Chronicle reports that the dead bodies of priests were suspended from an oak tree, until they were torn to pieces by a bear (regarded by pagans as a holy animal). From the 10th to the 13th centuries, the territory was controlled by the Novgorod Republic. Beloozero was the seat of a small principality between 1238 and the 1370s, but subsequently between 1380 and 1384 became subordinate to the Grand Duchy of Moscow. On July 10, 1612, Polish and Lithuanian vagabonds (Lisowczycy) captured Belozersk without a fight, looting the town. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, Beloozero was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as Saint Petersburg Governorate) and named one of the towns constituting the governorate.–£–∫–∞–∑ –æ–± —É—á—Ä–µ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –≥—É–±–µ—Ä–Ω–∏–π –∏ –æ —Ä–æ—Å–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–∏ –∫ –Ω–∏–º –≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–æ–≤ In 1727, a separate Novgorod Governorate was split off and Belozersk became the seat of Belozersk Province in Novgorod Governorate. In 1776, the territory was transferred to Novgorod Viceroyalty. In 1796, the viceroyalty was abolished and Belozersky Uyezd became a part of Novgorod Governorate. In June 1918, five uyezds of Novgorod Governorate, including Belozersky Uyezd, were split off to form Cherepovets Governorate, with the administrative center in Cherepovets. On August 1, 1927, Cherepovets Governorate was abolished and its territory became Cherepovets Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. At the same time, uyezds were abolished and Belozersky District was established. On September 23, 1937, Belozersky District was transferred to newly established Vologda Oblast. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Belozersk serves as the administrative center of Belozersky District.Resolution #178 As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Belozersky District as the town of district significance of Belozersk.Law #371-OZ As a municipal division, the town of district significance of Belozersk, together with four rural localities in Glushkovsky Selsoviet and two rural localities in Kunostsky Selsoviet of Belozersky District, is incorporated within Belozersky Municipal District as Belozersk Urban Settlement.Law #1107-OD Climate Belozersk falls just within the subarctic climate range, with the fourth-warmest month being just below the isotherm of to nearby humid continental areas. Winters are cold but not severe by Russian standards for areas north of the 60th parallel. Economy =Industry= The economy of Belozersk is based on the timber and food industries. =Transportation= Belozersk is connected by all-seasonal roads with Cherepovets, Kirillov, and Lipin Bor (connecting further to Vytegra). There are also local roads. The Belozersky Canal, a part of the Volga‚ÄìBaltic Waterway (formerly known as the Mariinsk Canal System), which connects the river courses of the Sheksna and the Kovzha, runs through Belozersk, bypassing Lake Beloye from the south. Culture and recreation The town of Belozersk is classified as a historical town by the Ministry of Culture of Russia, which implies certain restrictions on construction in the historical center. The medieval monuments in the town center are the Assumption Church (1552) and the Transfiguration Cathedral (1668). The wooden shrine of St. Elijah was built in 1690. The neighborhood is rich in old cloisters, such as Kirillo-Belozersky and Ferapontov Monasteries. Assumption Church in Belozersk Belozersk Assumption Cathedral in 1909 Two of the most famous medieval icons were created in the 13th century in Belozersk: the Virgin of the White Lake and Saints Peter and Paul. They constitute an intermediate style between Novgorodian and Northern icon painting.

The estate was sold in 1871 and became a hotel, a purpose for which it is still used today. The castle is a Grade II Listed building. It is surrounded by of gardens and natural woodland,Treganna Castle Estate website (accessed 2008-04-22) and has views along the coastline of Cornwall. History Tregenna Castle was built in 1774 by Samuel Stephens a member of an important local family. The architect was probably John Wood, the Younger. The building was extended in the 19th century. The estate was put up for sale by auction on 31 October 1871. The castle - \\"an imposing castellated edifice, very substantially built of granite\\" - at the time included three pairs of bedrooms on the upper floor and another bedroom on the ground floor; a school room; billiard room; WCs; and servants' quarters in the basement. The sale included the \\"park, lodge, glen, pasture grounds, gardens, woods, plantations, and lands in hand 90 Acres, 1 Rood, 20 Perches.\\" The estate was bought by the Bolitho family. =Railway hotel= Tregenna Castle Hotel in about 1890. (Photochrom print) The Great Western Railway (GWR) opened its St Ives branch line on 1 June 1877 and it leased the Tregenna Castle as a hotel the following year, opening it on 5 August 1878. Early railway hotels had only been situated near large terminals or junctions, but this one was the first intended by the GWR as a holiday destination in its own right. Sir Daniel Gooch, the chairman of the GWR, stayed at the hotel a few weeks after it opened to the public. He recorded in his diary that ::\\"the situation of this house is very fine; it is a castle within its own grounds of about , a great part of which are gardens and woods with pretty shaded walks ... The house feels more like a private house than a hotel; the views from it are very fine, looking over the town and bay of St Ives and along the coast as far as Trevose Head.\\"Diary of Sir Daniel Gooch, quoted in Jenkins (1992) The GWR purchased the hotel outright in 1895. One of the GWR's buses, a 1.5 ton Milnes-Daimler type, was stationed at the hotel from 1913 to convey residents to the golf links at Lelant but the service was suspended in 1916 due to fuel shortages during World War I. It was replaced in 1922 by a new bus on a Burford chassis. This operated for seven years until the arrival of a new Thornycroft bus with a Duple body in 1929. The Great Western Railway named two of its express locomotives after the hotel: *Duke Class number 3280 carried the name \\"Tregenna\\" from 1897 to 1930. *Castle Class number 5006 was given the name \\"Tregenna Castle\\" in 1927. =Subsequently= The GWR was nationalised to become the Western Region of British Railways on 1 January 1948. Railway hotels throughout the United Kingdom eventually became the British Transport Hotels division but they were all privatised during the 1980s. The hotel and grounds are currently managed by the Tregenna Castle Estate. References in popular culture The English guitarist and composer Anthony Phillips was a frequent visitor to St Ives with his family in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and in 1972 composed a guitar duet entitled Tregenna Afternoons.

Due to its vague boundaries, counties are colored according to whether they are always, generally, or occasionally included in the region, darkest to lightest. Little Dixie is a historic 13- to 17-county region along the Missouri River in central Missouri, United States. Its early European-American settlers were largely migrants from the hemp and tobacco districts of Virginia, and central Kentucky and Tennessee. They brought enslaved African Americans with them or purchased them as workers in the region. Because Southerners settled there first, the pre-Civil War culture of the region was similar to that of the Upper South. The area was also known as Boonslick country. A 1948 article in the Missouri Historical Review defined the antebellum \\"Little Dixie\\" region as a 13-county area between the Mississippi River north of St Louis to Missouri River counties in the central part of the state (sections of Audrain, Boone, Callaway, Chariton, Howard, Lincoln, Pike, Marion, Monroe, Ralls, Randolph, Saline, and Shelby counties), as indicated on the map linked via this footnote. This issue also contains other factual data about this region. Issue has map of region on cover When the Southerners migrated to Missouri, they brought their cultural, social, agricultural, architectural, political and economic practices, including slavery. Overall, Missouri's slave population represented 10 percent of the state's population in the 1860 US Census. But in Little Dixie, county and township slave populations ranged from 20 to 50 percent by 1860, with the highest percentages for the counties developed for large plantations along the Missouri river. New Madrid County, along the Mississippi River south of St. Louis, also had a high percentage of African slaves, but was not considered part of the region. Definition While definitions of the counties included in Little Dixie vary, in 1860 the following seven counties were developed primarily for plantations, and their populations consisted of 25 percent or more enslaved African Americans: * Callaway * Boone * Howard County * Saline County * Chariton County * Lafayette County * Clay County. The only other county of the state where the enslaved population was as high in 1860 was New Madrid in the Bootheel, a region in the southern part of the state along the Mississippi River that was devoted to cotton plantations. T. J. Stiles, Jesse James: The Last Rebel of the Civil War, New York: Vintage Books, 2003, pp.10-11 The Missouri Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans defines the \\"heart\\" of Little Dixie as having consisted of the following counties:\\"Little Dixie, Missouri\\" , Missouri Division - Sons of Confederate Veterans], accessed 3 Jun 2008 * Audrain * Boone * Callaway * Howard * Monroe * Randolph The major cash crop was hemp. In Lafayette County, locals declared hemp as king and dedicated all agricultural production to it, while foregoing necessary food production. In addition, planters in \\"Outer Little Dixie\\" counties, such as Platte, Howard, Chariton and Ralls, grew millions of pounds of tobacco on large plantations with 20 or more slaves. Some farmers and planters grew cotton and sent their surplus down the Missouri River to St. Louis, and down the Mississippi to New Orleans. Cotton was exported to Britain, or shipped north to textile mills in New York and New England. In Howard County, developed along the river for plantations, planters named their large estates in the Southern style, such as Greenwood, Redstone, Oakwood and Sylvan Villa. On these plantations, slave populations ranged between 15 and 70 people; they cultivated acreage of 500 acres (2 km¬≤) to 2000 acres (8 km¬≤), or more. Postwar history After the Civil War, the slaves were emancipated. The Reconstruction-era legislature established free public education for all citizens for the first time. While whites insisted that schools be segregated, the legislature required that all townships with 20 or more black children of student age had to establish schools. By 1870, of the former slave states, Missouri had the \\"largest proportion of schools for negro children.\\"Robert Brigham, The Education of the Negro in Missouri, Ph.D. dissertation, University of Missouri- Columbia, 1946, p. 125 Black communities rapidly established independent churches and schools to express their own culture and create a sphere outside white supervision. In Little Dixie in the early 20th century, of the counties with the largest black populations, > Callaway County at one time had twenty-eight African American schools; > Boone, eighteen; Howard, sixteen; Cooper, twenty-six; Chariton, fourteen; > Lafayette, twenty; Saline, eighteen.

The pattern appears to be strongly associated with the history of slavery, the rural economy after the war, and white efforts to establish dominance in resulting race relations. In the late 19th-century white Democrats throughout the South sought to reimpose and maintain white supremacy. Between 1889 and 1919, a period that is considered the \\"nadir of racial relations\\" in the United States, Southern states disenfranchised most blacks through new constitutions and amendments. Lynchings of black men were numerous in the South in this period. In 1890 in the traditional seven counties of Little Dixie, the black population totaled 45,000. It increased into the early 20th century.Rural and Small Town Schools in Missouri (2003), p. 10 In the \\"nadir\\" period, there were 13 lynchings of black men in total in Boone, Howard, Monroe, Pike, and Randolph counties. This number represented 16 percent of the total lynchings in the state during this period, whereas these seven counties contained less than 6 percent of the state's total population. African Americans comprised slightly more than 50 percent of the victims of lynching in other parts of Missouri. In these seven counties, more than 90 percent of lynch victims were black, and they were overwhelmingly men. Mechanization of farms decreased the need for farm labor beginning in the early 20th century. African Americans left the region in the Great Migration for northern and midwestern industrial cities, including St. Louis. They also sought to escape the violence and social oppression. The United States Supreme Court ruling of Brown v. Board of Education (1954) declared segregated public schools to be unconstitutional, but integration of schools was slow in many areas of the South and Missouri. After integration, some former black schools were closed and adapted for new uses; others were in too poor condition to be used. In many parts of Little Dixie, some antebellum plantation homes still stand today. Many people participate in heritage tourism and historic projects to preserve these structures and other aspects of this era. Other aspects of the region's complex history, including after the Civil War, are also being studied and preserved. Beginning in 1998, the State Historic Preservation Office (of the Department of Natural Resources), conducted a survey to identify the remaining historic African-American schools in the fifteen counties of Little Dixie; this survey was extended throughout the state and lasted until 2002.Rural and Small Town Schools in Missouri (2003), p. The study documented the historic structures, identifying those that were unique architecturally. It also captured the stories of people associated with them. The team conducted many oral interviews with former students, teachers, administrators and members of the communities to learn about their communities during the Jim Crow era.Rural and Small Town Schools in Missouri, (2002), p. 8 Because many of the former rural schools consisted of just one room, they have been adapted for a wide variety of uses. Many have survived. In addition, schools were often started in black churches or chapels, many of which still stand.Rural and Small Town Schools in Missouri, (2002), pp. 11-13 As a result of the study, the state recommended numerous African-American schools for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. Continuing demographic changes throughout the 20th century have resulted in a decrease in the number and proportion of African Americans in most of the seven counties of Little Dixie. Only Boone County in 2010 had an increase in African-American population since 2000.

They are often referred to as \\"horny toads\\", although they are not toads, but lizards. Description There are several important characteristics that can be used to identify desert horned lizards from other horned lizards. Horned lizards can be distinguished from other lizards by the large pointed scales that protrude from the back of their heads, giving them the appearance of having horns, as well as the flat and broad shape of their bodies. This species of lizard has a distinctive flat body with one row of fringe scales down the sides. They are a medium sized lizard and can grow up to approximately 3.75 inches or 95mm in size. They have one row of slightly enlarged scales on each side of the throat. Colours can vary and generally blend in with the color of the surrounding soil, but they usually have a beige, tan, or reddish dorsum with contrasting, wavy blotches of darker color. They have two dark blotches on the neck that are very prominent and are bordered posteriorly by a light white or grey color. They also have scattered pointed scales and other irregular dark blotches along the dorsum of their body. Unlike other horned lizards, Phrynosoma platyrhinos individuals do not have a prominent dorsal stripe. Their dorsal stripe can appear faintly or be entirely absent depending on the individual. They also have pointed scales on the dorsum (back) of the body. Juveniles are similar to adults, but have shorter and less-pronounced cranial spines. Desert horned lizards have horns that are wide at the base, which isn't true for their congener, the short-horned lizard. Pictured to the left is Blainville's Horned Lizard (Phrynosoma blainvillii), note the colored horns and double row of fringed scales alongside the body. The desert horned lizards' horns also do not come into contact with one another at the base. Diet Desert horned lizards prey primarily on invertebrates, such as ants (including red harvester ants,) crickets, grasshoppers, beetles, worms, flies, ladybugs, meal worms and some plant material. They can often be found in the vicinity of ant hills, where they sit and wait for ants to pass by. Ants contain a large amount of chitin, an indigestible compound, this makes them not as nutrient rich, so larger amounts must be consumed to sustain Phrynosoma platyrhinos. As an evolutionary advantage desert horned lizards developed larger stomachs to allow them to consume larger concentrations of ants. When they find an area of soft sand, they usually shake themselves vigorously, throwing sand over their backs and leaving only their head exposed. This allows them to hide from predators and await their unsuspecting prey. Habitat Found in extremely diverse habitats. The flat-tailed horned lizard occurs in areas of fine sand, while the short-horned lizard (P. douglasii) is found in shortgrass prairie all the way up into spruce-fir forest. The most common species in the Arizona Upland subdivision is the regal horned lizard (P. solare), which frequents rocky or gravelly habitats of arid to semiarid plains, hills and lower mountain slopes. The desert horned lizard (P. platyrhinos) is found mostly in the Sonoran and Mojave deserts. It can be found in southeastern Oregon, California, western Arizona and Utah, and Nevada. Outside of the United States it is found in Mexico, northwestern Sonora, and northeastern Baja California. They have a preference for places that they can find shrub covering with an understory. Phrynosoma platyrhinos will often bury themselves in sand soil, if possible, or they will live in burrows that were constructed by other animals. Geographic range and subspecies They typically range from southern Idaho in the north to northern Mexico in the south. These lizards can generally be found in areas with desert climates throughout western North America. Changes in the environment due to climate change can trigger shifts in the geographic ranges of animals. Phrynosoma platyrhinos has experienced some changes after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) which ended approximately 21,000 years ago. The end of the LGM resulted in the expansion of deserts throughout western North America, and with that expansion Phrynsoma platyrhinos had more areas suitable for them to live in. At the end of the LGM P. platyrhinos was able to expand north into the Great Basin, which is now part of their current geographical range. There are two subspecies which are found in a different geographic ranges: the northern desert horned lizard (Phrynosoma platyrhinos platyrhinos) ranging in Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, the Colorado front range, and parts of southeastern Oregon; and the southern desert horned lizard (Phrynosoma platyrhinos calidiarum) ranging in southern Utah and Nevada to southeast California, western Arizona, and northern Baja California. Behavior Desert Horned Lizard sunning while blending into its environment. They are generally a gentle species, but have been known to try to push their cranial spines into the hand while held. When excited, they puff themselves up with air, similar to the way a Chuckwalla does, making themselves look bigger. If spotted near a bush, they will dash into it in an attempt to find cover from any threat. Unlike most other species of horned lizard, Phrynosoma platyrhinos is most likely to run when startled, though they will often only run for a short period of time before stopping again. Like several other horned lizard species, desert horned lizards are able to squirt blood from their eyes. The desert horned lizard has also been observed to exhibit rain-harvesting behavior in the wild, a behavior previously only attributed to a handful of other species. When rain-harvesting the lizard adopts specific posture in order to get its mouth closer to the ground. Like other iguanids P. platyrhinos performs a number of displays. Iguanid displays are usually used to assert a social structure or for aggression and courtship, and can present in a variety of different behaviors such as: push ups, bobbing of the head, tail movements, along with changes in posture. In P. platyrhinos these displays are less aggressive and appear to be most concerned with sex and species recognition. These behaviors include various tail positions such as curled, between the legs, or arched down with scratching behaviors, push ups, and a three-legged stance where one of the hind legs is held off the ground and the back is presented to predators.

It developed around Hedingham Castle, the ancestral seat of the de Veres, Earls of Oxford. The first earl, Aubrey de Vere III, finished the initial building of the keep and established a Benedictine nunnery, Castle Hedingham Priory, near the castle gates. Hugh de Vere, fourth earl of Oxford, purchased the right to hold a market in the town of the crown in the mid-13th century. He also founded a hospital just outside the gates of the castle around 1250. The village's main attractions are the well preserved Norman Hedingham Castle, the Colne Valley Railway, Kirby Hall and its many timber-framed medieval buildings. The church of St. Nicholas is late Norman and Gothic, building having commenced around 1180. The fine double hammerbeam roof is attributed to Thomas Loveday, who was responsible for work on St John's College, Cambridge. Its Romanesque wheel window and cemetery cross are remnants of the Norman church.

Geography Fouta-Djallon consists mainly of rolling grasslands, at an average elevation of about 900 m (3,000 ft). The highest point, Mount Loura, rises to 1,515 m (4,970 ft). The plateau consists of thick sandstone formations that overlie granitic basement rock. Erosion by rain and rivers has carved deep jungle canyons and valleys into the sandstone.

In its heyday, it was said that Fuuta-Jaloo was a magnet of learning, attracting students from Kankan to the Gambia, and featuring Jakhanke clerics at Tuba as well as Ful…ìe teachers. It acted as the nerve centre for trading caravans heading in every direction. The more enterprising commercial lineages, of whatever ethnic origin, established colonies in the Futanke hills and along the principal routes. It served their interests to send their sons to Futanke schools, to support the graduates who came out to teach, and in general to extend the vast pattern of influence that radiated from Futa Jalon. Amadou Hamp√¢t√© B√¢ has called Fuuta-Jaloo \\"the Tibet of West Africa\\" in homage to the spiritual and mystic (Sufi) tradition of its clerics. Children in the village of Doucky Economy Mainly rural the economy covers animal husbandry (cattle, sheep, goats), agriculture, gathering, trading, and marginal tourism.  Rural economy  The Ful…ìe practice a form of natural farming that can be recognized today as biointensive agriculture. The region's main cash crops are bananas and other fruits. The main field crop is fonio, although rice is grown in richer soils. Most soils degrade quickly and are highly acidic with aluminum toxicity, which limits the kind of crops that can be grown without significant soil management.  Biointensive agriculture  Suntuure Mindmap Sometime in the late 18th century, the Ful…ìe in Fouta Djallonke developed a type of biointensive agriculture, probably out of necessity, since the conquered indigenous women were taken into the households of their Islamic overlords whose livestock became their responsibility. Combining animal husbandry and sedentary agriculture into an efficient system of agropastoralism required a new way of organizing daily life. Livestock, which included horses and cattle, ate more and produced more waste than what the indigenous farmers were accustomed. Since the livestock had to be protected from wildlife at night, they were brought into the family compound, referred to by the French as a tapade, and locally as cuntuuje (sing. suntuure) in the Pular language. Today, livestock graze in open areas during the day but are sheltered in corrals during the night, except for goats, which are permitted to manage on their own within limits. A similar pattern must have developed by the latter part of the 18th into the 19th century. Nonetheless, the disposal of livestock waste, which became woman's work, required a systematic way of disposing of it. And, over time, the women worked out a method for doing so. In organic gardening, their solution is called sheet composting or mulching. Over time, the women mixed a variety of other organic matter with the manure (kitchen scraps, harvest residues, and vegetative materials from a living fence or hedgerow) and piled it each day on their garden beds and trees to decompose and become nutritious humus. In the 20th century, livestock among the Ful…ìe shifted from large animals to smaller types. Horses, perhaps due to the tsetse fly decreased, while goats, sheep, pigs, and poultry increased, and n'dama cattle remain an integral asset. Permaculture Zones The tapade gardens of Fouta Djallon have been highly researched by international scholars from various disciplines. This research has revealed that the cuntuuje system has a higher soil nutrient level than any other soil in the region. Almost all labor, except for the initial preparation, is performed and managed by women and children, in the past and now, within each family group. The gardens are important for both food and cash crops for their families. PLEC, a project of the United Nations University, measured yields on 6.5 ha from tapade fields at Misiide Heyre, Fouta Djallon and found that maize yielded up to 7 t/ha, cassava 21 t/ha, sweet potatoes 19 t/ha, and groundnuts (peanuts) about 8 t/ha.Boiro, Ibrahima; Barry, A. Karim; & and Diallo, Amadou. (2003). \\"Guin√©e.\\" Chap. 5. In Harold Brookfield, Helen Parsons & Muriel Brookfield (eds.). Agrodiversity: Learning from farmers across the world., pp. 110-133. Tokyo: United Nations University Press. Specific information cited from p. 116. Each suntuure is about 1-hectare (2.5 acres) on average, so referring to them as gardens is not accurate, neither for their size nor complexity. The cuntuuje represents a systems approach to food production, and is distinguished by their agrodiversity, as well as the way the people intensively use and maximize a limited amount of land. Today, the cuntuuje gardens continue to produce a significant quantity and variety of agricultural products.Harold Brookfield, Exploring Agrodiversity, Chapter 5.

(Colloques et S√©minaires); Carole LAUGA-SALLENAVE, Terre et territoire au Fouta-Djalon (Guin√©e), GRET - University Paris X, 1999. The living fences that surround each suntuure are not just a barrier to keep out people, wild animals, and domestic livestock. In the permaculture vocabulary, the fence is a vegetative berm, and is instrumental in the process of nutrient cycling and nutrient retention within the suntuure. In other words, the cuntuuje represent a sustainable biointensive polyculture farm system and landscape architecture, housing one or more microclimate ecosystems and are examples of what we know today to be a permaculture design. The graphic in this section is a mind map of the internal zones and sectors found typically in a suntuure environment. The interior of the suntuure, Zones 1-3 (internal gate, entryway, privacy screen, and residence) are reserved primarily for family members. It is in Zones 4 and 5 (the hoggo and suntuure living fence) where most activities of daily life occur. Here, visitors are greeted at a secondary shelter or pavilion, work on gardens (hoggos) is organized, children spend the day in play and work if of age, and afternoon prayers, naps, conversations, and meals occur until dark. Zone 6 is the outside world. In 2003, the cuntuuje of Fuuta-Jalon were recognized by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UNFAO) as one of the Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems.Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS); \\"Tapade Cultivation System, Guinea,\\" A project of the United Nations Food & Agriculture Organization. Urban The largest town in the region is Lab√©. Migration Fuuta-Jalon has historically had a high degree of migration, usually short-term, and mainly to Senegal and Sierra Leone. Many Fulbe fled to Senegal after Sekou Toure became president of independent Guinea in 1959. Many settled in Leidi Ulu west of the Gambia River and began farming in addition to keeping cattle. They remembered Guinea as a land of fruit and honey where laborious agriculture was not necessary.

It is generally used in reference to naval operations to ensure that SLOCs are open, or in times of war, to close them. In the American Revolutionary War and the Napoleonic Wars, the SLOCs were, for the most part, in the control of the British Navy. When the British lost control of them during the Revolution, the result was the fall of Yorktown and its biggest army and, ultimately, the war. In the Napoleonic era, maintaining belligerence throughout, the British embargoed and blockaded any country associated with Napoleon, which created large economic hardships and dislocations that ultimately led to the people of France becoming disenchanted with Napoleon. In World War I and World War II, the British and Germans declared mutual blockade and the Kriegsmarine attempted to close the SLOCs from North America to the British Isles with the use of submarines. In each case the Allies succeeded in keeping the sea lanes open. The Germans in each case failed to defeat the British naval blockade of Germany. The United States Navy in World War II successfully closed the SLOCs to Japan, strangling the resource-poor island nation. The importance of SLOCs in geopolitics was described in Nicholas J. Spykman's America's Strategy in World Politics published in 1942. Had the Cold War turned hot, Europe would have required resupply and reinforcement from North America.

The game involves two teams of unlimited numbers (the 'townsmen' and the 'countrymen' of St Columb parish) who endeavour to carry a silver ball to goals set apart or across the parish boundary, making the parish, around in area,https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=67bce0ed36dd4ee0af7a16bc079aa09a the de facto largest sports ground in the world. History and antiquities =Bronze and Iron Ages= Monuments that date from these periods include Castle an Dinas, an Iron Age hillfort, the Nine Maidens stone row, the largest row of standing stones in Cornwall, and the Devil's Quoit (sometimes recorded as King Arthur's Quoit) in the hamlet of Quoit, King Arthur's Stone, said to be not far from the Devil's Quoit near St. Columb, on the edge of the Goss Moor, was a large stone with four deeply impressed horseshoe marks. Legend has it that the marks were made by the horse upon which Arthur rode when he resided at Castle An Dinas and hunted on the moors. =Middle Ages and early modern period= There are four Cornish crosses in the parish: two are in the churchyard, one is at the hamlet of Black Cross and another (defaced) at Black Rock.Langdon, A. G. (1896) Old Cornish Crosses. Truro: Joseph Pollard; pp. 206, 219 & 395-96Beacham, Peter & Pevsner, Nikolaus (2014). Cornwall. New Haven: Yale University Press. ; p. 519 (one of the crosses is illustrated below, under Church.) In 1333 Edward III granted a market in St Columb Major to Sir John Arundell. This was as a reward for supplying troops to fight the Scottish at the Battle of Halidon Hill near Berwick-on-Tweed. Following the Prayer Book Rebellion of 1549, William Mayow the Mayor of St. Columb was hanged by Provost Marshal, Anthony Kingston outside a tavern in St Columb as a punishment leading an uprising in Cornwall.Payton, Philip (1996) Cornwall.

The King's forces were quartered at this time near St. Columb, where a smart skirmish took place between the Prince's regiment and a detachment of the Parliamentary army under Colonel Rich, in which the latter was victorious. In the year 1676, the greatest part of the church of St Columb was blown up with gunpowder by three youths of the town.Gilbert, Davies The Parochial History of Cornwall =Twentieth century= Royal visits were made to St Columb in 1909, 1977 and 1983. On 9 June 1909 the town was visited by the Prince of Wales (George V) and his wife, the Princess of Wales (Mary of Teck). The visit was to open the Royal Cornwall Agricultural Show. The Prince gave 2 silver cups: one for the best bull and another for the best horse.. The Times, Thursday, 10 June 1909; pg. 9; Issue 38982 In August 1977 The Queen and Prince Philip visited the town during their Silver Jubilee tour of Cornwall. On 27 May 1983: The town was visited by the Prince and Princess of Wales (Charles and Diana). The visit was to commemorate the 650th anniversary of the signing of the town charter by Edward III.. The Times, Saturday, 28 May 1983; pg. 10; Issue 61544 A plaque commemorates this visit outside the former Conservative club in Union Square. In 1992 Australian stuntman Matt Coulter aka The Kangaroo Kid set the record for the longest jump with a crash on a quad bike at Retallack Adventure Park, St Columb Major. Geography Map of St Columb Major and surrounding area, by Robert K. Dawson, 1810 St Columb is in mid-Cornwall, about 8 miles (12 km) inland from the north coast of Padstow Harbour. The parish covers an area of . Its highest point, at , is Castle an Dinas, the site of an Iron Age hill fort about east of St Columb. Much of the land in the parish is used for farming (both arable and pastoral), with small areas of woodland. There is some moorland in the generally slightly higher northern and eastern parts of the parish, notably part of the Goss Moor in the southeast, Castle Downs below Castle an Dinas (east) and an area of moorland adjoining Rosenannon Downs (northeast). The Vale of Lanherne, the valley of the River Menalhyl (see below) is famed for its beauty and occupies the area to the west of the town, connecting St Columb and St Mawgan churchtown. =Town= St Columb occupies a plateau at about elevation. The north part of the town (known as 'Bridge') descends into the Vale of Lanherne, having a minimum elevation of approximately . It was originally a linear settlement built on the main road running north-east to south-west, but modern estates have since been built, extending the town to the south and east. In the older part of the settlement there is much high-density housing with relatively narrow streets, and a number of retail outlets and public houses; the more modern estates have housing which is generally lower in density. To the south there is an industrial estate. =Settlements= Besides the town, there are numerous villages and hamlets in the parish, including Talskiddy and Gluvian in the north, Ruthvoes (southeast), Trebudannon (south), Tregaswith (southwest), Tregatillian (east) and a large number of smaller farming settlements and isolated dwellings. There are also Halloon, Lanhizey, Rosedinnick, Tregamere, Trekenning, Tresaddern, Trevarron, Trevolgas and Trugo. =Rivers= A number of small rivers and streams flow through St Columb parish, most rising in the eastern part and flowing west. One of the sources of the River Fal lies just within the boundary on the Goss Moor; this flows southwest to the South Coast. The River Menalhyl, which flows through the north part of St Columb (Bridge), has three branches with a confluence at Gilbert‚Äôs Water, just to the east of the town. The longest of these rises next to the Nine Maidens standing stones in the north part of the parish. The Menalhyl was historically important in the area, powering a number of mills along its course. A smaller river rises near Winnard's Perch (north of Talskiddy), later joining the Menalhyl near its mouth at Mawgan Porth. The other main river of the parish is the unnamed one (often called the River Porth) that rises to the east of Ruthvoes, and that in its latter course fills the Porth Reservoir and enters the sea at St Columb Porth. This is the river that, according to legend, was begun by the blood of the murdered Saint Columba running down the valley. =Protected areas= Borlasevath and Retallack Moor (SSSI), noted for its biological characteristics, series of thin lakes and streams is directly north of spa/lodges resort Retallack; which occupies some of the thinner end, the north of the parish.https://www.achurchnearyou.com/search/?lat=50.46&lon;=-4.91 =Transport= The A39 main road runs north to south through the parish. Until the late 1970s it went through the town but a bypass now carries traffic east of St Columb. The A30 dual carriageway also runs through the southeastern part of the parish north of Goss Moor. The Par-Newquay railway line does not enter St Columb parish but forms part of its southern boundary. A small part of the parish is occupied by a corner of Newquay Airport, which is Cornwall‚Äôs principal civil airport. Architecture Union Square The older part of the town follows a linear layout along Fair Street and Fore Street. Many houses on the narrow main street are slate hung. Cornish architect Silvanus Trevail designed Lloyds Bank and the school. Private houses by Trevail include Ashleigh House (1896) and Treventon House (1897). There are some good examples of architect William White's work including Bank House (circa 1857), Rosemellyn House (1871) Penmellyn House Old Rectory and alterations to Trewan Hall. The Retreat was formerly St Columb Workhouse and was designed by George Gilbert Scott. In recent years there has been a surge of high quality new buildings on the edges of the town, including Jenner Parc and Arundell Parc. Other buildings of note include Barclays Bank, the Red Lion public house, Bond House, Hawkes shop and the town hall. The oldest house in St Columb is the Glebe house Church St Columb Major Church The church is dedicated to St Columba, a local saint: her well is at Ruthvoes. For most of the Middle Ages the church belonged to the Arundells of Lanherne and was lavishly endowed. Within the church were two chantry chapels served by six priests altogether (five for the Arundell chantry).The Cornish Church Guide (1925) Truro: Blackford; pp. 50, 74‚Äì76 The tower is a fine example of a fifteenth-century building, consisting of four stages with battlements and pinnacles. It is high and contains eight bells re-hung in 1950. In 1920 the chiming clock was added as a memorial to the men of St Columb who died in the Great War. In 1860 plans were drawn up by William Butterfield, in hope of St Columb church becoming the cathedral of the future diocese of Cornwall, but the cathedral was built at Truro. The church is the venue for the \\"Classic Cornwall\\" music festival. St Columba's Holy Well The holy well dedicated to Saint Columba adjoins the hamlet of Ruthvoes, about from the town.[*St Columba Way website Retrieved May 2010 According to legend, she was beheaded here. The hamlet is near to the A30 dual carriageway and the Par to Newquay railway line. Literary associations * St Columb features several times in the 1961 novel Castle Dor, by Daphne du Maurier (with Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch.) In particular it mentions the parish church, Castle An Dinas, The Red Lion Inn and Tresaddern Farm. *The fictional character named Alfred John Trewhella (from St Columb) features in Kangaroo a novel by D. H. Lawrence, first published in 1923. It is set in Australia and is an account of a visit to New South Wales by an English writer named Richard Lovat Somers, and his German wife Harriet, in the early 1920s. This appears to be semi-autobiographical, based on a three-month visit to Australia by Lawrence and his wife Frieda, in 1922. The novel includes a chapter describing the couple's experiences in wartime Cornwall, vivid descriptions of the Australian landscape, and Richard Somers's sceptical reflections on fringe politics in Sydney.

The game was released in North America on February 11, 2003 and in Europe on April 4, 2003. The objective consists of collecting magical hearts and unlocking more worlds to play, defeating enemies and jumping across platforms. Vexx is armed only with the legendary Astani war talons, which give him the power to defeat his enemies, as well as fly and swim under water.  Gameplay  Vexx is primarily a 3D platformer with a design mentality akin to Super Mario 64. The player controls Vexx through a variety of non-linear open levels. The player is free to explore these levels and complete challenges in any order. Vexx can perform a number of jumps, can climb walls, swim, perform combo attacks and juggle enemies. He can also fire projectiles if the player charges his War Talons.  Plot  The introduction tells briefly of a planet called Astara that was inadvertently destroyed by its own inhabitants, who \\"opened a door better left closed\\". The planet was, in fact, destroyed by the Shadowraiths, who had poured through the Landspire and the Rift system that had been created by the ambitious Astani in order to access other worlds. The Wraiths, led by their leader Dark Yabu, attacked Astara, ultimately draining all of the energy out of the Rift system. However, an official supplementary comic reveals how Treyven, the Guardian of Astara, used the legendary Astani war talons to defeat the entire first wave of the Shadowraiths at the cost of his own life. Seven hundred years later, Astara is literally in pieces, and all that is left are large chunks of land floating in an asteroid field. However, the individual pieces of the planet are still habitable. One village known as the Overwood, populated by a primitive race called the Valdar, is eventually discovered by Dark Yabu, who attacks the village with his Shadow Horde. The only Valdani who try to resist are Vargas, the village Guardian, and his grandson, Vexx. Despite their bravery, they are overcome by Yabu's forces and are shackled with the rest of the villagers, all of whom are then made to toil in mines searching for Wraithearts - the last remains of the first wave of Wraiths and the only remaining source of the Rift system's power. Vexx is \\"beaten with word and whip\\" until \\"his rage became unbearable\\", and he finally lashes out at his oppressors. He is stopped by Yabu, who would have killed him if Vargas had not then attacked Yabu to save his grandson. Furious, Yabu turns on Vargas instead and murders him with his shadow powers. Later that night, determined more than ever to get revenge, Vexx sneaks out of the caves and onto Yabu's windship. There he discovers Treyven's skeleton wearing the legendary Astani war talons and clutching a spire of rock. Yabu had kept the talons hidden for years because he was unable to destroy them and feared them falling into enemy possession. The talons permanently attach themselves to Vexx's hands, at the same time causing an explosion that destroys the windship and nearly kills Vexx. While he is unconscious, Vexx learns through a vision that Vargas' soul is still imprisoned within Yabu's magical amulet; Yabu plans to feed on the soul's pain and misery until Vargas is no more. Vexx is then taught how to use the Astani war talons while still unconscious by the weapons themselves, which pass on all the knowledge and experience of the previous talonbearers. When he wakes up, Vexx is in the Hall of Heroes, where previous wearers of the war talons have been entombed. An old man named Darby appears and informs him that it was he who carried Vexx to the Hall, thinking that the young boy was dead. He also tells Vexx that Yabu completely destroyed the village and that Vexx and Darby are the only ones left. Darby, however, is too old to fight, so he instructs Vexx to collect the hearts of dead Wraiths, which still contain the energy drained from the rift system, and use them to power the gates in order to find and stop Yabu before he opens the gate to his own world. Before Vexx departs, Darby warns him that the Wraiths are shape shifters and to \\"trust no one along your journey\\". Later on, Vexx meets up with Darby again inside the Landspire, and the two of them encounter Reia, the last remaining Astani warrior, who is also the narrator of the game. Reia exposes Darby, who turns out to be Dark Yabu in disguise. Both Reia and Vexx try to attack Yabu but he escapes, taking Reia's magical staff with him. It is revealed that by collecting the Wraith hearts, Vexx was actually helping Yabu power the gate to his own world. Since the only way to close the rift is with Reia's staff, Vexx has to activate the rest of the gates and catch up to Yabu to get it back. Vexx finally finds Yabu in the Shadow Realm, and the two of them fight one last time. During the battle, Vexx manages to take Yabu's amulet, which gives him an extra dose of power. Vexx ultimately wins and retrieves the staff, but Yabu's death causes the platform on which he and the portal back to Astara stand to begin to crumble. Unable to get back through the portal, he throws the staff through, successfully closing the rift and thus saving Astara, but also trapping himself in the shadow realm. He is last seen roaming the desolate, wraith- infested lands.  Development and release  Development of Vexx began in late 1999 by Acclaim Studios Austin, with the studio wanting to create a mascot platformer for the then-next generation consoles. The development team was led by creative director David Dienstbier and designer Thomas Coles and varied in size, ranging from around 22-40 people who had worked on some of Iguana's previous titles, such as Turok: Dinosaur Hunter. Coles cited several platformer games as inspiration for the game, specifically Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie. The game was initially titled Clip and Mischief, and starred a rodent-like creature named \\"Clip\\", who had a small, reptilian sidekick named \\"Mischief\\". This idea was shelved when the development team thought the concept was too similar to Jak and Daxter. In order to differentiate the game, several gameplay mechanics were changed about halfway through development, primarily the focus on one main playable character. The development team renamed the main character \\"Jinx\\" based on his bad luck and his knack for getting into terrible situations, but faced legal issues with the name. The character was renamed \\"Vexx\\" out of the notion that he would try to turn his bad luck onto his enemies. Vexx's design changed several times during development. Designers initially submitted ideas for a character that Acclaim would be proud to have as their own brand mascot. The development team soon came to the conclusion that the character should be designed around the gameplay mechanics, and not the other way around. As Coles explained, \\"Mario is not a great character because he's Mario and he's designed out of nowhere. He's Mario because of the games he's been in and people have grown to love him.\\" After creating the core gameplay mechanics, Acclaim did focus testing and worked on finalizing the design, taking inspiration from many sources. Vexx's gauntlets, for example, were inspired by a character's gloves from the comic book series Battle Chasers, and the team found them perfect for applying effects to give them the moveset they wanted. Though the development team tried to create a focused story for the game, they intentionally left Vexx's backstory open-ended so as to allow players to more freely identify with the character as an everyman hero. Technology development on the game began in the first half of 2000, with the first game assets being created in November 2000. Early work on Vexx was done on PC, since the then-next generation consoles hadn't been released yet. The game was always planned to be released on all three platforms, but the team found it easiest to transition to the Xbox, due to its use of the same development tools. As development progressed, the team branched out and had people working on all three versions simultaneously. Acclaim tried to play to the strengths of each console, supporting, for example, Dolby Digital on Xbox and Dolby Pro-Logic II on the PlayStation 2 and GameCube. With the exception of these and minor tweaks involving the platforms' controllers, the three versions are identical. Vexx was developed at the same time as Turok: Evolution, and though the games were developed by different development teams at Acclaim Studios Austin, they share the same engine and many of the same resources. The game was officially unveiled at E3 2001 as Jinx and re-introduced as Vexx on January 14, 2002. Vexx was originally slated for an October 2002 release, but was delayed in order for the team to have extra time to polish the game. The development team was inspired by the then-newly released Super Mario Sunshine and its use of previews showing players where to find the shine sprites in the game, and added similar previews in the form of arrow indicators as a last-ditch effort to make the game easier for casual players. Vexx was finally released in North America on February 11, 2003 and in Europe on April 4, 2003. The game was published by Acclaim Entertainment for the PlayStation 2, GameCube and Xbox video game consoles. Due to time constraints and insufficient funding, much content was cut during development. Vexx originally featured six worlds, with each world containing three levels, forming a combined total of 18 levels. The worlds idea was eventually scrapped, and half of the levels were cut from the game in order to focus on the remaining nine a year before the game was released. The game originally featured six bosses, including a troll boss featuring heavily in pre-release footage who eventually ended up as an NPC. The game's day/night cycle was supposed to play a significantly larger role as well, with the development team trying to create a light/dark world akin to The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. Several suit power-ups were also cut from the game, including an underwater suit that allowed Vexx to swim faster.

He decided to leave that pursuit and become a musician. In 1986 Ross produced and published his first album, Kehewin, on cassette, and became a full-time musician. He performed as a duo with his wife, singer Kelly McGowan, in 1986 and 1987, and then in a trio called Harbord Trio with her and violinist Oliver Schroer. At the same time he was member of a New Age jazz quartet called Eye Music. He composed music for several theatre productions in Toronto dealing with First Nations life in Canada, such as The Ecstasy of Rita Joe (York University, 1989), Dreaming Beauty (Inner Stage Theatre, 1990) and Big Buck City (Cahoots Theatre, 1991).

One obvious but unattributed influence is the psychedelic 1967 track 'Embryonic Journey' by Jefferson Airplane. Ross's advanced technique and his sure feeling for rhythm combine with uncommon ideas to make his style instantly recognizable. He often uses percussive techniques and plays intricate down and upstroke patterns with his thumb. These techniques have found their way into the toolboxes of many competitive fingerstyle guitarists. His use of acrylic nails allows him to get a consistent, clean tone without the hassle of broken fingernails. Don Ross played a Lowden S-10 in the beginning of his career, but since 1997 has played a Lowden O-10. Today he plays custom-made guitars by Marc Beneteau, a Canadian luthier from St. Thomas, Ontario. The Beneteaus are equipped with a combination of microphone and K&K; pickups. Occasionally he plays a baritone guitar and a harp guitar by Marc Beneteau, or uses a custom 7-string by Oskar Graf, a luthier from Clarendon, Ontario.

Located above cliffs on the River Wye, construction began in 1067 under the instruction of the Norman Lord William FitzOsbern. Originally known as Striguil, it was the southernmost of a chain of castles built in the Welsh Marches, and with its attached lordship took the name of the adjoining market town in about the 14th century. In the 12th century the castle was used in the conquest of Gwent, the first independent Welsh kingdom to be conquered by the Normans. It was subsequently held by two of the most powerful Anglo-Norman magnates of medieval England, William Marshal and Richard de Clare. However, by the 16th century its military importance had waned and parts of its structure were converted into domestic ranges. Although re-garrisoned during and after the English Civil War, by the 1700s it had fallen into decay. With the later growth of tourism, the castle became a popular visitor destination. The ruins were Grade I listed on 6 December 1950.  Building of the castle  Chepstow Castle, seen from the north bank of the River Wye Chepstow Castle is situated on a narrow ridge between the limestone river cliff and a valley, known locally as the Dell, on its landward side. Its full extent is best appreciated from the opposite bank of the River Wye. The castle has four baileys, added in turn through its history. Despite this, it is not a defensively strong castle, having neither a strong keep nor a concentric layout. The multiple baileys instead show its construction history, which is generally considered in four major phases. The first serious architectural study of Chepstow began in 1904 and the canonical description was long considered to be by Perks in 1955. Recent studies have revised the details of these phases, but still maintain the same broad structure. = Foundation, 1067‚Äì1188 = The Great Tower The speed with which William the Conqueror committed to the creation of a castle at Chepstow is testament to its strategic importance. There is no evidence for a settlement there of any size before the Norman invasion of Wales, although it is possible that the castle site itself may have previously been a prehistoric or early medieval stronghold. The site overlooked an important crossing point on the River Wye, a major artery of communications inland to Monmouth and Hereford. At the time, the Welsh kingdoms in the area were independent of the English Crown and the castle in Chepstow would also have helped suppress the Welsh from attacking Gloucestershire along the Severn shore towards Gloucester. However, recent analysis suggests that the rulers of Gwent, who had recently fought against King Harold, may initially have been on good terms with the Normans.Miranda Aldhouse-Green and Ray Howell (eds.), Gwent In Prehistory and Early History: The Gwent County History Vol.1, 2004, The precipitous limestone cliffs beside the river afforded an excellent defensive location. Building work started under William FitzOsbern in 1067 or shortly afterwards. The Great Tower was probably completed by about 1090, possibly intended as a show of strength by King William in dealing with the Welsh king Rhys ap Tewdwr.Rick Turner and Andy Johnson (eds.), Chepstow Castle ‚Äì its history and buildings, 2006, It was constructed in stone from the first (as opposed to wood, like most others built at this time), marking its importance as a stronghold on the border between England and Wales. Although much of the stone seems to have been quarried locally, there is also evidence that some of the blocks were re-used from the Roman ruins at Caerwent. The castle originally had the Norman name of Striguil, derived from the Welsh word ystraigl meaning \\"river bend\\". FitzOsbern also founded a priory nearby, and the associated market town and port of Chepstow developed over the next few centuries. The castle and the associated Marcher lordship were generally known as Striguil until the late 14th century, and as Chepstow thereafter. =Expansion by William Marshal and Roger Bigod, 1189‚Äì1300= Plan of Chepstow Castle from 1825 Further fortifications were added by William Marshal, Earl of Pembroke, starting in the 1190s. The wood in the doors of the gatehouse has been dated by dendrochronology to the period 1159‚Äì89. Marshal extended and modernised the castle, drawing on his knowledge of warfare gained in France and the Crusades. He built the present main gatehouse, strengthened the defences of the Middle Bailey with round towers, and, before his death in 1219, may also have rebuilt the Upper Bailey defences. Further work to expand the Great Tower was undertaken for William Marshal's sons William, Richard, Gilbert and Walter, in the period to 1245. In 1270, the castle was inherited by Roger Bigod, 5th Earl of Norfolk, who was a grandson of William Marshal's eldest daughter, Maud. He constructed a new range of buildings in the Lower Bailey, as accommodation for himself and his family. Bigod was also responsible for building Chepstow's town wall, the \\"Port Wall\\", around 1274‚Äì78. The castle was visited by King Edward I in 1284, at the end of his triumphal tour through Wales. Soon afterwards, Bigod had built a new tower (later known as \\"Marten's Tower\\"), which now dominates the landward approach to the castle, and also remodelled the Great Tower. Later history =Decline in defensive importance, 1300‚Äì1403= The external walls From the 14th century, and in particular the end of the wars between England and Wales in the early 15th century, its defensive importance declined. In 1312 it passed into the control of Thomas de Brotherton, Earl of Norfolk, and later his daughter Margaret. It was garrisoned in response to the rebellion of Owain Glynd≈µr in 1403 with twenty men-at-arms and sixty archers but its great size, limited strategic importance, geographical location and the size of its garrison all probably contributed to Glynd≈µr's forces avoiding attacking it, although they did successfully attack Newport Castle. =The 15th to 17th centuries = In 1468, the castle was part of the estates granted by the Earl of Norfolk to William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke in exchange for lands in the east of England. In 1508, it passed to Sir Charles Somerset, later the Earl of Worcester, who remodelled the buildings extensively as private accommodation. From the 16th century, after the abolition of the Marcher lords' autonomous powers by King Henry VIII through the Laws in Wales Acts of 1535 and 1542, and Chepstow's incorporation as part of the new county of Monmouthshire, the castle became more designed for occupation as a great house. =The Civil War and its aftermath= The castle saw action again during the English Civil War, when it was in the front line between Royalist Monmouthshire and Parliamentarian Gloucestershire. It was held by the Royalists and besieged in both 1645 and in 1648, eventually falling to the Parliamentarian forces on 25 May 1648. A memorial to Sir Nicholas Kemeys, who led the Royalist defence during the Second Civil war and was killed in combat after refusing to surrender after the castle's fall, lies within the keep.https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/206177 After the war, the castle was garrisoned and maintained as an artillery fort and barracks. It was also used as a political prison. Its occupants included Bishop Jeremy Taylor, and ‚Äì after the Restoration of the monarchy ‚Äì Henry Marten, one of the Commissioners who signed the death warrant of Charles I, who was imprisoned here before his own death in 1680. =Decay of the building, and the start of tourism= Chepstow Castle showing the Great Tower, seen from the 1816 Wye Bridge In 1682, the castle came into the ownership of the Duke of Beaufort. The garrison was disbanded in 1685, and the buildings were partly dismantled, leased to tenants and left to decay. Various parts of the castle were used as a farmyard and a glass factory. By the late 18th century, its ruins became, with other sites in the Wye valley, a \\"Picturesque\\" feature on the \\"Wye tour\\", pleasure boat trips down the river from Ross-on-Wye via Monmouth. The first guide book to the castle and town was written by Charles Heath of Monmouth and was published in 1793. =The 19th and 20th centuries= By the 1840s, tourism was continuing to grow, particularly with day trips on steam ships from Bristol. At the same time, the courtyard of the castle began to be used for local horticultural shows, f√™tes, and, increasingly from the 1880s, historical pageants sanctioned by the Duke of Beaufort. Although he tried to sell the castle in 1899, no buyer could be found. In 1910/11, the castle and adjoining river bed were the site of well-publicised excavations by Dr. Orville Ward Owen, who was attempting to find secret documents to prove that Shakespeare's plays had in fact been written by Francis Bacon. In 1913, the movie Ivanhoe, starring King Baggot, was made in the grounds. The following year, the castle was bought by businessman William Royse Lysaght, of Tutshill, and conservation work began. In 1953, the Lysaght family put the castle into the care of the Ministry of Works. In 1977 Terry Gilliam shot some of his film adaptation of Lewis Carroll's \\"Jabberwocky\\" at the castle. During 1984‚Äì1986, it was used as one of the locations for HTV's \\"Robin Of Sherwood\\" starring Michael Praed.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086791/locations, Robin Hood (1984‚Äì1986) Filming & Production Brazilian heavy metal band Sepultura recorded part of their fifth album Chaos A.D. in the castle, in 1993. \\"Sepultura: Spreading Chaos\\", TeamRock.com, 25 February 2004  The castle today  Chepstow Castle is open to the public, and since 1984 has been in the care of Cadw, the Welsh government body with the responsibility for protecting, conserving and promoting the built heritage of Wales.

Life and work  Born in Chicago 1921 into a Catholic family, Richard Michael Gorman Powers spent most of his early life supported by his mother and aunt. His father left the family when Powers was young. At eleven, Powers was introduced to art when his uncle gave him a sketch book, although in later life his uncle's wife would try to prevent him from making any art. He studied Greek at Loyola University before switching to art, taking classes at Mizen Academy, Chicago Art Institute and the University of Illinois at Chicago. After enlisting to join World War II, he took more art classes at the University of Kentucky during basic training, thereafter working in the Signal Corps in New York City. He married and began a career in illustrations for magazines and publishing houses, continuing his art education at The New School in New York.The Art of Richard Powers by Jane Frank Eventually, he became one of the most influential science fiction and fantasy fiction artists of all time. He began by working in a conventional pulp-derived style, but quickly evolved a personal Surrealist idiom influenced by the cubists and surrealists, especially Picasso and Yves Tanguy. He also dabbled in abstract art and collage at a later age before dying in 1996 at the age of 75. From the 1940s through the 1960s, he did many of covers for Doubleday. During the 1950s and 1960s, he served as an unofficial art director for Ballantine Books. For many years, the science fiction art of the estate of Richard Powers, which includes original artwork, was represented by Worlds of Wonder, and it is still possible to contact them about gaining usage rights to art pieces. The estate of Richard Powers is offering pieces of Richard Powers' fine art collection for sale - both originals and authorized reproductions - through Baldwin Hill Art & Framing in Natick, Massachusetts.

The station is licensed to suburban Golden Valley, transmits from the KMSP-TV tower in Shoreview, and is owned by Cumulus Media, with studios in Southeast Minneapolis in the Como district. History The original call letters were KEVE-FM and the station was co-owned with sister AM station KEVE-AM. KEVE-AM's history predates the FM by 14 years; it launched in May, 1948 and was owned by Family Broadcasting until mid-1956 and was known until at least then as KEYD, co-owned with KEYD-TV 9 (now KMSP-TV and launched by Family Broadcasting in January, 1955). The KEYD Radio studios were located in downtown Minneapolis on 9th Street off of Hennepin Avenue practically next to the Orpheum Theater (see 1953 photo link below). Calls were changed to KADM to complement its AM sister (as in \\"Adam and Eve\\") in October 1963. A gradual shift from country music to a mix of classical music, show tunes and adult standards began in 1960 and was completed on both stations by March 1963. On December 1, 1964, the call letters for both radio stations became KQRS. The KEVE-AM studios had, by 1957, moved to its transmitter site in Golden Valley at 917 Lilac Drive, set back from Minnesota State Highway 100. This location was the first studio and transmitter site for the station. The KQRS call sign stayed with the AM until 1982, when it switched to an oldies format as KGLD before returning to the simulcast and the KQRS calls less than two years later. In 1996, the AM was again split from the FM to become one of the first affiliates of Radio Disney, a format targeting children (see KDIZ). Both stations were owned by Disney at the time. In early 2001, KQRS and KDIZ (along with sister stations 93X and 105.1/105.3/105.7) moved to studios and offices at 2000 Elm Street SE in Minneapolis, near the University of Minnesota campus. In the mid-1960s, KQRS programmed a Middle of the Road-format (MOR) with classical and big band music and Brazilian Bossa Nova music in evenings. In addition to this format, Joe Pyne's talk radio show was carried. In the summer of 1968, KQRS started experimenting with freeform rock in the late night hours with a program called \\"Nightwatch\\" with George Donaldson Fisher as DJ. This became very popular with college age listeners and in a few months the rock format was expanded to begin playing in the evenings as well with DJ Alan Stone, and was known as \\"Nightwatch Trip One\\", with Fisher's program renamed slightly as \\"Nightwatch Trip Two.\\" A few months later, this became the primary 24-hour format. The station is currently celebrating its 50th anniversary as a rock station. By 1977, the freeform rock would give way to a tightly programmed rock approach, courtesy of radio consultants Burkhart/Abrams and their \\"Superstars\\" format, which was essentially just the hits from album rock. This approach continued into 1986, with respectable, if not spectacular ratings, when KQRS signed a new consultant, Jacobs Media, and evolved into its present-day classic rock format. That, coupled with its massively popular morning show, elevated KQRS to the top of the ratings. In 1994, KQRS had the distinction of unseating legendary area broadcaster WCCO (830 AM) as the most-listened-to station in the Minneapolis-St. Paul market (12+), an achievement which WCCO had held unchallenged for decades. The KQ92 Morning Show hosted by Tom Barnard was a major element in KQ's ascendance to the top spot, along with shifting market demographics. Barnard and the KQ Morning Show also were successful in holding the top rating spot when Howard Stern made his debut on the Twin Cities airwaves in 1997. Stern lasted only until mid-1999 in Minneapolis as his ratings brought him to the number two position in morning drive time, but the station that carried the show, WRQC, had poor ratings during the rest of the day, leading to the dropping of Stern and a format change. Rival KRXX, then known as \\"93X\\", was purchased by then-owners Capital Cities-ABC in the Spring of 1994, and the station's call sign was changed to KEGE with a new alternative rock format. It primarily competed with the growing \\"REV 105,\\" though KQRS' parent company purchased the three REV signals in 1997. The stations went through several incarnations, including heavy metal, Urban Oldies and for the majority of the time, alternative rock, as well as Soft AC/oldies, adult contemporary and sports talk, prior to flipping to its current classic hip hop format on August 14, 2015 as 105 The Vibe. With the three formats, Disney initially created what has been referred to in the industry as the \\"wall of rock\\". With the three formats covering different major rock genres, Disney dominated rock radio in the Twin Cities, and used 93X and Drive 105/Zone 105 as 'flankers' to ward off competitors trying to knock off KQRS, its station with the largest audience in the market and the company's local cash cow. KQRS had been programmed by award-winning programming veteran (and former DJ) David Hamilton for over 25 years, until his retirement in December 2012. At that time, Cumulus appointed WZGC (Atlanta) Program Director Scott Jameson who exited in January 2020. The KQRS airstaff is live and local 24 hours a day and has remained unusually consistent for years as well, with most staffers there for 10 years or more. Tom Barnard has hosted the long-running morning show since 1986 (currently with Tony Lee, Brian Zepp and Candice Wheeler), Ray Erick hosts middays 10am-3pm; Lisa Miller does the afternoon drive from 3pm-7pm. \\"Steve Gorman Rocks\\" Weeknights from 10pm -3am. KQ's Weekend airstaff includes: Chris Nelson, Ryder, James, Steve Gunnar and Shannon Knight. In May 2005, KQRS began offering podcasts of the morning show through the station's website. On June 1, 2007, Citadel Broadcasting closed on its purchase of ABC Radio, acquiring KQRS. KDIZ, the former KQRS 1440, was retained by Disney. Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011. KQRS-HD2 KQRS began broadcasting an HD signal in 2007, with an HD simulcast of the station's main analog signal. The station ran a classic country format branded as \\"The Bear\\" on its HD2 signal, but took that off the air on December 31, 2014 at midnight. The HD simulcast of the KQRS analog signal in digital returned full-time on December 31, 2016 at 9:30pm. A reworked and much improved \\"The Bear\\" returned to KQRS- HD2 on June 27, 2018 offering a format of classic country and solid gold country hits from the early 60s into the early-mid 2000's. Pop culture In the 1996 Christmas-themed movie Jingle All the Way, the character played by Arnold Schwarzenegger calls KQRS during a contest in an effort to win a rare toy doll for his child. He gets through and answers the question correctly but finds out that he only won a gift certificate. The film is set in and was shot in the Twin Cities.

Also known as the distortionless condition, it can be used to improve the performance of a transmission line by adding loading to the cable. The condition Heaviside's model of a transmission line. A transmission line can be represented as a distributed- element model of its primary line constants as shown in the figure. The primary constants are the electrical properties of the cable per unit length and are: capacitance C (in farads per meter), inductance L (in henries per meter), series resistance R (in ohms per meter), and shunt conductance G (in siemens per meter). The series resistance and shunt conductivity cause losses in the line; for an ideal transmission line, \\\\scriptstyle R=G=0. The Heaviside condition is satisfied when :\\\\frac{G}{C} = \\\\frac{R}{L}. This condition is for no distortion, but not for no loss. Background A signal on a transmission line can become distorted even if the line constants, and the resulting transmission function, are all perfectly linear. There are two mechanisms: firstly, the attenuation of the line can vary with frequency which results in a change to the shape of a pulse transmitted down the line. Secondly, and usually more problematically, distortion is caused by a frequency dependence on phase velocity of the transmitted signal frequency components. If different frequency components of the signal are transmitted at different velocities the signal becomes \\"smeared out\\" in space and time, a form of distortion called dispersion. This was a major problem on the first transatlantic telegraph cable and led to the theory of the causes of dispersion being investigated first by Lord Kelvin and then by Heaviside who discovered how it could be countered. Dispersion of telegraph pulses, if severe enough, will cause them to overlap with adjacent pulses, causing what is now called intersymbol interference. To prevent intersymbol interference it was necessary to reduce the transmission speed of the transatlantic telegraph cable to the equivalent of baud. This is an exceptionally slow data transmission rate, even for human operators who had great difficulty operating a morse key that slowly. For voice circuits (telephone) the frequency response distortion is usually more important than dispersion whereas digital signals are highly susceptible to dispersion distortion. For any kind of analogue image transmission such as video or facsimile both kinds of distortion need to be eliminated. Derivation The transmission function of a transmission line is defined in terms of its input and output voltages when correctly terminated (that is, with no reflections) as :\\\\frac{V_\\\\mathrm{in}}{V_\\\\mathrm{out}} = e^{\\\\gamma x} where x represents distance from the transmitter in meters and :\\\\gamma = \\\\alpha +j \\\\beta \\\\, are the secondary line constants, Œ± being the attenuation in nepers per metre and Œ≤ being the phase change constant in radians per metre. For no distortion, Œ± is required to be independent of the angular frequency œâ, while Œ≤ must be proportional to œâ. This requirement for proportionality to frequency is due to the relationship between the velocity, v, and phase constant, Œ≤ being given by, :v = \\\\frac{\\\\omega}{\\\\beta} and the requirement that phase velocity, v, be constant at all frequencies. The relationship between the primary and secondary line constants is given by :\\\\gamma^2 = (\\\\alpha +j \\\\beta)^2 = (R+j \\\\omega L)(G + j \\\\omega C)\\\\, which has to be of the form \\\\scriptstyle (A+j\\\\omega B)^2 in order to meet the distortionless condition. The only way this can be so is if \\\\scriptstyle (R+j \\\\omega L) and \\\\scriptstyle (G + j \\\\omega C) differ by no more than a real constant factor. Since both have a real and imaginary part, the real and imaginary parts must independently be related by the same factor, so that; :\\\\frac {R}{G} = \\\\frac {j \\\\omega L}{j \\\\omega C} and the Heaviside condition is proved. =Line characteristics= The secondary constants of a line meeting the Heaviside condition are consequently, in terms of the primary constants: Attenuation, :\\\\alpha = \\\\sqrt {RG} nepers/metre Phase change constant, :\\\\beta = \\\\omega \\\\sqrt {LC} radians/metre Phase velocity, :v = \\\\frac {1}{\\\\sqrt {LC}} metres/second =Characteristic impedance= The characteristic impedance of a lossy transmission line is given by :Z_0=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{R+j\\\\omega L}{G+j\\\\omega C}} In general, it is not possible to impedance match this transmission line at all frequencies with any finite network of discrete elements because such networks are rational functions of jœâ, but in general the expression for characteristic impedance is irrational due to the square root term.Schroeder, p. 226 However, for a line which meets the Heaviside condition, there is a common factor in the fraction which cancels out the frequency dependent terms leaving, :Z_0=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{L}{C}}, which is a real number, and independent of frequency. The line can therefore be impedance-matched with just a resistor at either end. This expression for \\\\scriptstyle Z_0 = \\\\sqrt{L/C} is the same as for a lossless line (\\\\scriptstyle R = 0,\\\\ G = 0) with the same L and C, although the attenuation (due to R and G) is of course still present. Practical use An example of loaded cable A real line, especially one using modern synthetic insulators, will have a G that is very low and will usually not come anywhere close to meeting the Heaviside condition. The normal situation is that :\\\\frac{G}{C} \\\\ll \\\\frac{R}{L}. To make a line meet the Heaviside condition one of the four primary constants needs to be adjusted and the question is which one. G could be increased, but this is highly undesirable since increasing G will increase the loss. Decreasing R is sending the loss in the right direction, but this is still not usually a satisfactory solution. R must be decreased by a large fraction and to do this the conductor cross-sections must be increased dramatically. This not only makes the cable much more bulky but also adds significantly to the amount of copper (or other metal) being used and hence the cost. Decreasing the capacitance also makes the cable more bulky (since the insulation must now be thicker) but is not so costly as increasing the copper content. This leaves increasing L which is the usual solution adopted. The required increase in L is achieved by loading the cable with a metal with high magnetic permeability. It is also possible to load a cable of conventional construction by adding discrete loading coils at regular intervals. This is not identical to a distributed loading, the difference being that with loading coils there is distortionless transmission up to a definite cut-off frequency beyond which the attenuation increases rapidly. Loading cables to meet the Heaviside condition is no longer a common practice. Instead, regularly spaced digital repeaters are now placed in long lines to maintain the desired shape and duration of pulses for long-distance transmission.

The games are often compared to Rare's shooters GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark since Free Radical Design was founded by a group of ex- Rare employees who developed these games. Each game features a time travelling element which enables players to battle in a temporal war in a diverse number of locations set over the span of several centuries. The look of the series is stylized, with character models and expressions emphasizing more cartoon-like qualities and comic book-inspired design. Many of the characters represent parodies of established pop culture stereotypes (such as the aristocratic English explorer or the suave secret agent). Many aspects of the series also focus on often surreal and self-deprecating humor. The main antagonist in each of the games are the TimeSplitters, a race of aliens who wreak havoc on humanity throughout time as well as their supposed creator Jacob Crow. On August 15, 2018, it was announced that THQ Nordic AB had acquired the rights to the franchise. On August 14, 2019, it was announced that series co-creator Steve Ellis has joined Deep Silver to \\"plot the future of course of the series\\". On August 21, 2019, Dambuster Studios, who consist of several Free Radical Design developers, replied to a fan on Twitter stating that Steve Ellis had assembled a team and is working on an unannounced TimeSplitters product. Games =TimeSplitters= The first game was released as a launch title for the PlayStation 2. The game features levels taking place in different time periods between the years 1935 and 2035. =TimeSplitters 2= Unlike its predecessor, the second game was also released for the Xbox and GameCube in addition to the PlayStation 2. It expanded heavily on the first TimeSplitters and featured a story that contains characters that would later be used in this game's sequel. =TimeSplitters: Future Perfect= The third game in the series was published by Electronic Arts as opposed to Eidos Interactive that published the previous two games. This game's story has a bigger role in the game than the previous two installments. This game had online capabilities for the Xbox and PlayStation 2 versions of the game, but the feature was omitted from the GameCube version. =TimeSplitters 4= In June 2007, the Official UK PlayStation Magazine revealed that another installment of the TimeSplitters series was being made. However, at Kotaku, Rob Yescombe, the scriptwriter for the previous title in the series, said that the systems they were developing the game for were \\"unsigned at the moment.\\" \\"I'm sure it's possible to do a control scheme that works,\\" Doak added, when asked about his thoughts on developing a first-person shooter for Wii. An early logo for the game was a spoof of the Gears of War logo with a monkey head replacing the skull. There was some concept art for a monkey in Master Chief's armour. Similarly, videos and screenshots of a monkey driving a heavy mechanical diving suit similar to ones featured in BioShock have been released on the developer's website. Because of this, it is expected that there will be more in-game \\"potshots\\" of those games as well as other gaming franchises. Yescombe from Free Radical Design confirmed that prediction. Free Radical Design mentioned that TimeSplitters 4 will not use the much-criticised Haze engine, instead opting for some \\"new and double shiny tech\\". This game was in development for almost a year but since Free Radical was bought out by Crytek after going into administration, little information has been released since. On August 17, 2009, the project had officially been declared as on hold. In an interview, Crytek UK claimed that they would continue the project once there is a high industry demand for such a game. On June 14, 2011, VideoGamer.com informed that a high-ranked source inside Crytek confirmed that the company is working on a new game of the TimeSplitters franchise to be released on next- generation platforms. There was no confirmation if the game is actually TimeSplitters 4, or if it will also be ported to the Wii U or PlayStation 4. The game is supposed to utilize CryEngine 3 and DirectX 11 technology. In 2012, Crytek CEO Cevat Yerli noted that expressed desire to work on the project, but also noted concern about the possible reception. He mentioned that he's been suggested crowdfunding a sequel, but deemed it inappropriate for a larger company such as Crytek. Yerli's comments about a possible crowdfunding campaign have ignited a petition to encourage such a venture, which Yerli himself has endorsed - as of February 2014, the page counts about half the supporters of the desired 100,000. On April 27, 2012, a spokesperson from Crytek confirmed that Timesplitters 4 was \\"not in development\\". On June 12, 2012, Cevat Yerli from Crytek stated that \\"Look, I wish we were working on it. The thing with TimeSplitters is, if we made a sequel to TimeSplitters, nobody would accept this apart from some fans, and we don't know how big the fan community is unfortunately.\\" In July 2013, TechRadar spoke to the Timesplitters series developer Steve Ellis. When he was asked if Timesplitters 4 would ever see the light of day on the 8th generation consoles, he replied \\"I don't think there's any chance that's going to happen, you always got to the point where the marketing person in the room would say 'I don't know how to sell this' because they want a character that they can put on the front of the box. Every marketing person and every publisher we spoke to [said] 'You can't have that as your selling point' and maybe the sales figures of previous games backed that up.\\" This statement suggests that it is very unlikely that Timesplitters 4 will ever be released. On August 15, 2018, THQ Nordic announced that they had acquired the IP and publishing rights for Timesplitters. In August of 2019, co-creator of the series Steve Ellis joined THQ Nordic to aid in the future planning of the series. With the series composer expressing interest with hopes of the original team joining hands again. TimeSplitters Rewind On November 29, 2012, it was revealed that a group of fans were given permission to develop a TimeSplitters mod using CryEngine 3. The project lead, Michael Hubicka, stated that the ultimate goal is to make it TimeSplitters 4. It was also announced that the development team would include some of the original members of Free Radical Design (now known as Crytek UK). The game will combine earlier elements of the trilogy and be named TimeSplitters Rewind. The project gained Crytek's approval thanks in part to a 75,000-strong petition from players. The development team intended to use Unreal Engine 4 however switched to CryEngine 3. The team said that, although the engine will give it more of a modern look, they \\"didn't plan on fixing something that isn't broken.\\" It is expected to feature both story and multiplayer modes and to be free of charge on the PC. A March 2013 announcement stated that a demo was planned to be released by December 2013.TimeSplitters Respawns Onto PC In March 2020, the game was confirmed to still be in development. Common gameplay elements =MapMaker= The series included MapMaker, a simple grid-based level editor. The first game in the series only allowed multiplayer arcade maps to be created. The second game allowed the player to make single-player story levels with objectives. The third game included the ability to have maps take place outdoors, unlike the previous games which only allowed indoor maps to be created. =Story mode= Story mode consists of a series of missions featured in each game that can be played with either one or two players. In the first TimeSplitters, this is based upon the retrieval of a key object and its successful return. TimeSplitters 2 and TimeSplitters: Future Perfect had additional objectives and more complex levels. =Arcade mode= Arcade mode is the multiplayer aspect of the TimeSplitters series. The games are notable for having numerous multiplayer modes including the traditional Deathmatch and Capture the Flag- type games, as well as other more original modes such as Flame Tag where one player is put on fire and must tag another player to pass the flame onto them. TimeSplitters 2 introduced Arcade League which are single player challenges, similar to Challenge mode, but arcade league challenges can be recreated in Arcade Mode. There are three leagues of increasing difficulty, and all challenges must be completed to at least a bronze level before access to the next league is granted. Rewards, such as extra characters for Arcade Mode, are given for successful completion. =Challenge mode= Challenge mode, available in all games of the series, consists of sets of single player challenges. The challenges range from collecting bananas as a monkey to shooting cardboard cutouts. In TimeSplitters 2 and Future Perfect challenges are unique and cannot be recreated through Arcade Mode, but in TimeSplitters many of the challenges are based around a pre-set Arcade match. Rewards, such as extra characters for Arcade Mode, are given for successful completion. =Time crystals= The time crystals are the nine green crystals used by the TimeSplitters to travel through time. In TimeSplitters 2, one of the objectives in each level revolved around collecting one of the time crystals. In Future Perfect the time crystals were brought to Earth to power a time machine created by the humans and the central objective of the game is to destroy them.

It began life as Letter to Slugger O'Toole, focused primarily on news and comment about Northern Ireland. From the beginning it has drawn its readership from a wide spectrum of opinion http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/3490568.stm both inside and outside Northern Ireland. 'Slugger' has developed a reputation as 'the watering hole of the political class in Northern Ireland.' It draws its regular contributors from a wide range of political perspectives including contributors with links to all of the main political parties as well as a number of 'independents'. Research commissioned in the summer of 2008 by Stratagem in association with ComRes revealed that 96% of the members of the Northern Ireland Assembly (MLAs) read the blog \\"regularly\\" or \\"occasionally\\". The site has a fairly rigorous comments policy in which personal abuse is discouraged and commenters are urged to 'play the ball and not the man' - a refrain that has since been popularised in the wider Irish political discoursehttps://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/abusive-verbal-attacks-on- president-higgins-mark-a-new-low-in-political-discourse-1.2084446. The choice of name was originally a reference to a sockpuppet character invented by Tim Murphy of New York, on an old CNN community called Peace in Northern Ireland. Murphy's \\"character\\" was invariably drunk on Bushmills, never listened to reasoned argument, and usually espoused strong loyalist politics, which often caught the unwary or recently arrived off guard. The idea of the Letter was to try to explain the complexities of Northern Ireland, slowly, regularly and in short bite-size pieces over a long, long period of time. Just like trying to explain something complex to a drunk man. The name is originally from the traditional Irish song \\"The Irish Rover\\", best known from a version recorded in collaboration by The Pogues and The Dubliners. The relevant line is: There was Slugger O'Toole who was drunk as a rule. However, the Letter part was dropped when the blog moved from its old blogspot venue and radically re- designed and built on a different blog platform.  The Slugger O'Toole Political Awards  In the autumn of 2008, Slugger O'Toole announced a series of political awards. With the stated intention of 'promoting a conversational politics', the awards sought to identify good examples of democratic practice. The inaugural awards were presented in Belfast on 7 October 2008 with comedian Tim McGarry as compere. The 2008 winners were as follows: *MLA of the year: Naomi Long MLA *Up and coming politician: Daithi McKay MLA *Journalism Award: David Gordon *Representatives external to Northern Ireland: The Rt Hon.

She served primarily as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic. She was named for Longueuil, Quebec. Longueuil was ordered in October 1941 as part of the 1942-1943 River-class building program. She was laid down on 17 July 1943 by Canadian Vickers Ltd. at Montreal and launched on 30 October 1943. Longueuil was commissioned into the RCN at Quebec City on 18 May 1944 with the pennant K672. War service She arrived at her homeport of Halifax, Nova Scotia and undertook work up training at Bermuda under the command of Lt. Cdr. M.J. Woods, RCNVR, her only commanding officer. Her first convoy escort took place with Convoy HX 302 which departed New York City on 4 August 1944 and arrived at Liverpool on 17 August. Longueuil was deployed with the convoy from 8 August until 13 August. With victory in Europe seemingly imminent, the RCN deployed Longueuil to Esquimalt in June 1945 in preparation for Operation Downfall, the Allied invasion of Japan. Longueuil joined the RCN's Pacific Fleet only weeks before the Surrender of Japan following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. She began a tropicalization refit in preparation for her service in the Pacific Ocean, but that was cancelled upon the surrender of Japan. Longueuil was paid off from the RCN on 31 December 1946 and the decision was made to dismantle her armaments and scuttle her to form a breakwater in Kelsey Bay, British Columbia in 1947.

Oro is an ancient martial arts master who lives a secluded life of an immortal hermit. Despite appearing only in Street Fighter III games, Oro gained significant notability due to his unusual and controversial character design. Character Oro is a hermit of Japanese descent who is over 140 years old, having mastered the secrets of immortality. He lives in a deep cave within the Amazon. Although he may not seem very strong, his lack of attachments has allowed him to exceed his legendary fighting skills beyond those of an ordinary person, though he does seem to have a weakness for cute girls. He attained such extraordinary abilities through the mastery of an extreme fighting style known as . He sets out on a journey to find a worthy successor of his secrets in order to kill time.

Retrieved on 2008-07-03 Oro appears in Street Fighter III and its subsequent iterations, Street Fighter III: 2nd Impact and Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike, noted for his unorthodox fighting style. In his ending in New Generation and 2nd Impact, Oro decides that the only martial artist he met worthy of inheriting his secrets was Ryu. In 3rd Strike, Oro's boredom has reached its limits. Many young fighters have come to him in trying to become his disciples, but no one has lasted his training long enough. One day, he heard rumors involving a \\"mysterious organization\\" and the \\"master of the fist\\" and he decided to investigate. In his ending, Oro is shown trying to make Ryu, who is unaware of Oro's presence in his training, his disciple again.All About Capcom Head-to-Head Fighting Game 1987-2000, page 331All About Capcom Head-to-Head Fighting Game 1987-2000, page 304 Oro is a fighter more suited for patient players, who \\"can deal some serious damage for the player that can wait for the right opening on an opponent.\\" Oro also appears in the Street Fighter Legends: Ibuki comic book miniseries where Ibuki's final ninja exam is to challenge him. Together with her friends Elena and Makoto, she goes to the shrine on Mount Atago, where Oro has travelled to meditate. After the fight, Oro says that she actually made him think about using both hands and commends her on an entertaining challenge. Oro later reappears in Street Fighter V during Dhalsim's character story as Dhalsim encounters him while teaching a police officer named Mahesh how to breathe fire. Oro engages a discussion with the yoga master about mastering one skill before he leaves sensing another interesting person in the area. He was later mentioned in Karin's character story as Karin travels to India to find Oro which Dhalsim tells her that he had already left in a few days. He's also seen in Menat's character story when Menat, sent by her master, warns him that there's an evil power in their world, to which Oro is already aware of. He was made a playable character in the game's fifth season. Reception In their review of Street Fighter III, GamePro said Oro and Necro felt out of place \\"because of their strange attacks and supernatural powers\\" and would have been better suited for a Darkstalkers game. Allgame called Oro the \\"strangest creature of them all\\" in Street Fighter III and compared him to Quasimodo. IGN cited Oro as an example of the new generation of Street Fighter games that featured \\"genetic mutants and oddballs\\", as he \\"didn't come close to normal\\". GameDaily named Oro the 22nd-most bizarre fighting game character. UGO Networks listed Oro as one of the top 50 Street Fighter characters due to his \\"unorthodox, powerful, and unique\\" design. IGN wrote that while Oro, along with the rest of the Street Fighter III cast, is not as memorable as the characters from Street Fighter II, he was \\"nicely designed\\". Heavy.com named Oro one of the characters wanted in Super Street Fighter IV, adding that Oro would work better in 3D than in 2D. Despite appearing only in SFIII, Oro was voted 35th- most popular out of 85 Street Fighter characters in Capcom's own poll for the 15th anniversary of Street Fighter.

It has for many centuries been a possession of the Boscawens, and remains so. Geography =Location= Tregothnan is located on a hill overlooking an inlet of the River Fal. It includes many varied grounds and wooded areas beyond the immediate environs of the house. History The house and estate is the historic seat of the Boscawen family, Viscounts Falmouth. Tregothnan was acquired in 1334 (or 1335) by John de Boscawen when he married the heiress, Joan de Tregothnan. The medieval house then had a courtyard plan with a prominent gate-tower.Beacham, Peter; Pevsner, Nikolaus (2014). Cornwall. New Haven and London: Yale University Press; pp. 638‚Äì40 The original medieval house was ransacked in the 17th century during the English Civil War. The new house was built after 1650. This building was visited and described by Celia Fiennes, a cousin of Hugh Boscawen, the builder. In the 18th century, the house was the home of Admiral Edward Boscawen. In 1818, the house was enlarged by William Wilkins for the fourth Viscount Falmouth and in 1845‚Äì48 Lewis Vulliamy rebuilt it for the second Earl of Falmouth. In 1872 the land holdings of Viscount Falmouth, of Mereworth Castle, Maidstone, Kent, were listed in the top ten land holdings in Cornwall, with an estate of , 3.41% of the total area of Cornwall. Tregothnan is still managed by the Boscawen family today. Description The house is mainly the work of William Wilkins (the rebuilding of 1816‚Äì18) and Lewis Vulliamy (the enlargement of 1845‚Äì48). Wilkins adopted an East Anglian Tudor Gothic style of great picturesqueness and the project retained parts of the medieval house; however Vulliamy's enlargement involved the removal of what remained of the medieval house.Beacham (2014), pp. 639‚Äì40 =Gardens= Tregothnan is famous for its large private botanical garden and arboretum, which are not open to the public. Guided visits to the garden may be arranged. A tea plantation was recently started on the grounds. Tregothnan was home to the first outdoor camellias in the UK, around 1800. The first commercial tea was developed from Camellia sinensis, the \\"Chinese tea plant\\", in 2001. The first 'English tea' was then sold in November 2005 to Fortnum & Mason of Piccadilly. The Tregothnan Estate plans on marketing a brand-named tea house franchise called Festival of Tea, to be opened as far afield as China. The first tea plants were established in the Kitchen Garden in 1999 although the conditions there were not suitable for expansion. Research was undertaken by Jonathon Jones, MD of Trading and botanist, on-site and in every tea region of the world with the support of a Nuffield Scholarship. Over 20,000 additional tea bushes are planted annually between April and October. The Tregothnan microclimate is the result of the 18 metre deep sea water creek that bisects the tea gardens, six miles inland and away from salt wind exposure. Global media interest in the project to create the most British tea in history has helped develop the charity open weekend of the gardens into possibly the largest of its kind in the world. There are custom-made bee hives among Leptospermum \\"Manuka bushes\\" producing Manuka honey with measurable methylglyoxal content.Tregothnan first grew Leptospermum in the botanical collection in the 1880s and may have helped introduce the genus to the UK in its Wardian Case, thought to be the only surviving example of a Wardian Case in the World. The extensive garden is usually open for a weekend in the spring and has become a major fundraising event for charities.

Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (; 8 August 1831 ‚Äì 25 April 1891) was the third son and sixth child of Tsar Nicholas I of Russia and Alexandra Feodorovna. He may also be referred to as Nicholas Nikolaevich the Elder to tell him apart from his son. Trained for the military, as a Field Marshal he commanded the Russian army of the Danube in the Russo-Turkish War, 1877‚Äì1878. Military career Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich was born on 8 August 1831 at Tsarskoye Selo in St. Petersburg. His father arranged for Nicholas Nikolaevich a career in the army. On the day he was born, he was appointed honorary colonel in the Life Guard Lancers and enlisted into the Life Guard Sappers battalion.‚ÄúThe Romanov Legacy : The Palaces of St. Petersburg‚Äù: Zoia Belyakova, p.140 A soldier most of his life, he first saw active service in the Crimea War, when he was in his early twenties, taking part in the battle of Inkerman (1854).‚ÄúThe Grand Dukes‚Äù: David Chavchavadze, p. 65 Grand Duke Nicholas Nicolaievich showed a special interest in military engineering. In 1856, he was appointed as general Inspector of engineers and in 1864, he became commander of the Imperial Guard. In 1873, he accompanied his brother, Alexander II, to Berlin at the meeting of the three emperors: Russia, Germany and Austria. The epitome of his career was the Russo-Turkish War, 1877‚Äì1878, when Nicholas Nicolaievich was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Russian armies of the Danube, although his reputation as a strategist was very low. The Grand Duke had no particular distinction in early successes in the conflict and these were followed by terrible reverses of the armies under his orders. After the expulsion of the Russian troops from Rumelia and unsuccessful attacks at Plevna, Nicholas Nicolaievich was removed from actual command , although in theory he remained in his post. The victory of his subordinates allowed him to participate in the success at Adrianople and the Treaty of San Stefano, but after the war ended, he was criticized for not seizing Constantinople when his headquarters were already established in Adrianople. The Grand Duke also suffered the acute embarrassment of being charged with financial irregularities, of receiving bribes and embezzling money from the government. His brother, Alexander II promoted Nicholas Nicolaievich's career and named him Commander of the St Petersburg military region. Eventually he received the ranks of Field Marshal-General, Inspector General of Cavalry and Inspector General of the Russian engineering forces. Nicholas Nicholaievich was an influential military figure; he also served on the State Council. A Russian Grand Duke Tall, strong and with a long thin nose, Nicholas Nicolaievich was neither handsome nor very intelligent. An incredible womanizer, Nicholas ‚Äúloved all women except for his wife‚Äù as a contemporary wrote. He enjoyed army life, hunting The Camera and the Tsars : Charlotte Zeepvat, p. 31 and was a well-known gourmet. He was also an expert on cattle, purebred dogs, horse breeding, fishing and hunting. In his luxurious residence in St Petersburg, the Nikolayevsky Palace, built between 1853‚Äì1861, horses were a favorite topic of conversation. The Grand Duke Nicholas Nicolaievich took great interest in managing his estates, but he failed to inspire affection, even in those closest to him. Marriage Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia in his youth Nicholas Nicolaievich unwillingly married his second cousin Grand Duchess Alexandra Petrovna, formerly Princess Alexandra of Oldenburg (1838‚Äì1900), whose paternal grandmother was a daughter of Emperor Paul I. The wedding took place in St Petersburg on 6 February 1856. Alexandra was plain and unsophisticated and the couple soon found out that they had little in common. They had two children: * Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia the Younger (1856‚Äì1929) * Grand Duke Peter Nikolaevich of Russia (1864‚Äì1931) The marriage was in trouble from the start and four years later, Nicholas developed a permanent relationship with Catherine Chislova, a dancer from the Krasnoye Selo Theater. Their affair was quite open and they had five children: * Olga Nikolaevna Nikolaeva (1868‚Äì1950) m. Prince Michael Cantacuzene * Vladimir Nikolaevich Nikolaev (1873‚Äì1942) * Catherine Nikolaevna Nikolaeva (1874‚Äì1940) * Nicholas Nikolaevich Nikolaev (1875‚Äì1902) * Galina Nikolaevna Nikolaeva (1877‚Äì1878) The Grand Duke arranged a change of class into the gentry for his mistress and the couple‚Äôs illegitimate children took the surname Nikolayev. Tsar Alexander II ignored his brother's affair but advised him to be discreet. Last years Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia Nicholas Nicolaievich was in Cannes with his two sons when his brother Alexander II was assassinated, returning immediately to Russia in March 1881. The ascension to the Russian throne of his nephew, Alexander III, marked the beginning of the Grand Duke's steady decline. Alexander III did not have any special sympathy for his uncle and Nicholas Nicholaievich was resolutely deprived of all his influence. His authority suffered even further when he was involved in fraudulent military requisitions. When the Grand Duke tried to explain his actions to the Nouvelle Revue of Paris 1880, he indiscreetly attacked government officials and military commanders and eventually was removed from his post. Alexander III also criticized his uncle's extramarital affairs. By then, Nicholas Nicholaievich was living openly with his mistress. His wife left him for good in 1881 and moved to Kiev, but the Grand Duchess refused to grant th–µ divorce he wanted. The couple's adult sons took their mother‚Äôs side in the family breakup, but continued to live at the palace and confronted Catherine once she was waiting for their father in the Palace he shared with his wife. Catherine Chislova nagged Nicholas to provide for her and their children, he soon became financially embarrassed and had to mortgage Nicholas Palace in St. Petersburg.‚ÄúThe Grand Dukes‚Äù: David Chavchavadze, p. 69 In 1882, Nicholas Nicolaievich was put under supervision due to the squandering of his fortune; he lived as a private gentleman in a modest house. Grand Duke Nicholas Nicolaievich, unable to get a divorce, hoped to survive his wife and then marry his mistress, but it was Catherine Chislova who died unexpectedly in Crimea while Grand Duchess Alexandra Petrovna would survive him by nine years.‚ÄúThe Romanov Legacy : The Palaces of St. Petersburg‚Äù: Zoia Belyakova, p.153 Shortly after his mistress' death, Nicholas went mad; he had oral cancer that spread to his brain. Suffering from delusion, he was convinced that all women were in love with him. During one ballet performance, the Grand Duke even attacked a young male dancer that he took to be a woman. In 1890, Nicholas Nicolaievich was declared insane and kept locked indoors in Crimea. He died in Alupka, Crimea on 25 April 1891. The Grand Duke's reputation at the imperial court was low and his death was not deeply felt. He had squandered all his tremendous wealth and his palace was immediately sold to cancel his massive debts.‚ÄúThe Romanov Legacy : The Palaces of St. Petersburg‚Äù: Zoia Belyakova, p.154 = Honours = ;RussianRussian Imperial Army - Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich (the Elder) of Russia (In Russian) * Knight of St. Andrew, 8 August 1831 * Knight of St. Alexander Nevsky, 8 August 1831 * Knight of the White Eagle, 8 August 1831 * Knight of St. Anna, 1st Class, 8 August 1831 * Knight of St. George, 4th Class, 24 October 1854; 2nd Class, 15 July 1877; 1st Class, 28 November 1877 * Knight of St. Vladimir, 1st Class, 1 January 1863 * Knight of St. Stanislaus, 1st Class, 1865 ;Foreign Ancestry References Bibliography *Alexander, Grand Duke of Russia, Once a Grand Duke, Cassell, London, 1932. *Beliakova, Zoia, The Romanov Legacy : The Palaces of St. Petersburg, Hazar Publishing, 1994, . *Chavchavadze, David, The Grand Dukes, Atlantic, 1989, *King, Greg The Court of the Last Tsar, Wiley, 2006, . *Perry, John and Pleshakov, Constantine, The Flight of the Romanovs, Basic Books, 1999, . *Zeepvat, Charlotte, The Camera and the Tsars, Sutton Publishing, 2004, . 1831 births 1891 deaths People from Pushkin, Saint Petersburg People from Tsarskoselsky Uyezd Russian grand dukes House of Romanov Members of the State Council of the Russian Empire Field marshals of Russia 19th-century Russian people Recipients of the Order of St. Andrew Recipients of the Order of St. Alexander Nevsky Recipients of the Order of the White Eagle (Russia) Recipients of the Order of St. Anna, 1st class Recipients of the House Order of Fidelity Grand Crosses of the Order of Saint Stephen of Hungary Grand Crosses of the House and Merit Order of Peter Frederick Louis Knights Grand Cross of the Ludwigsorden Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown (W√ºrttemberg) Grand Crosses of the Military Merit Order (W√ºrttemberg) Grand Crosses of the Saxe-Ernestine House Order Recipients of the Order of the White Falcon Recipients of the Order of the Black Eagle ","title":"Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1831‚Äì1891)"},{"id":"1365159","text":"Tyson Todd Meade (born September 15, 1962) is an American musician, painter, writer, teacher, and disc jockey best known as the principal singer and songwriter for pioneering alternative rock bands Defenestration and Chainsaw Kittens.

Background Meade was born in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, the youngest of five children. Before settling into retirement, his father worked as an architect, and his mother pursued a career as a nurse. Both parents, according to Meade, instilled in their son the values of treating others with respect, as well as frugality. Meade's childhood was filled by music: ‚Äú[Music] was the only thing I was into\\" says Meade, \\"It consumed me.\\" His sister Connie‚Äî16 when he was born in 1962‚Äîwould yank him out of the crib when the Beatles came on the radio. His mom would do the same with groups like the Supremes. \\"She really loved 'Love Is Like an Itching in My Heart,'\\" says Meade. His first two rock shows were Elvis at the Tulsa Assembly Center in 1972 and a night with Alice Cooper's harrowing Welcome to My Nightmare tour in 1975 . Meade's musical interest eventually gravitated to musicians like New York Dolls, David Bowie, T-Rex (band), and Patti Smith. According to Meade, music was the only place where he could find people who thought and dressed like him. In 1980, the summer Meade graduated from high school, he and fellow music lover, Todd Walker, hung out and wrote songs. According to Meade, \\"We were all listening to the same stuff‚Äîpunk, new wave, and fringe bands like Bowie, early Who and T-Rex. My brother Gentry sold me a Gibson Marauder. My cousin Duane showed me three chords, and said I could learn from there. One of the skaters [Meade hung out with] was Todd Walker, who started writing songs with me.\\" Meade was also fed up with 1980s corporate rock. Defenestration was formed. Defenestration Defenestration eventually moved to Norman, Oklahoma, where the band recorded its 1984's self-titled record. The relative success of that debut led to a deal with the record company Relativity Records and the release of 1987's Dali Does Windows. Produced by Randy Burns (Megadeth, The Flaming Lips), Dali Does Windows was reviewed as \\"a straightforward rock album, albeit one with the staunchly idiosyncratic Tyson Meade at its heart.\\" Eventually, artistic differences created a power struggle between Meade and Walker. The result was Walker being asked to leave the band and Defenestration falling apart: ‚ÄúTodd Walker and I had the usual power struggle, and the other guys and I kicked him out,‚Äù Meade says. ‚ÄúWhen we got another guitarist, things were just awful. We started working at an algae farm because we were so broke. It was basically slave labor with 12-hour workdays at $5.00 an hour no overtime. I started to have a breakdown.‚Äù Though he dove headfirst into writing songs, it became apparent to Meade that the new incarnation of Defenestration was lacking something. Frustrated and demoralized, Meade packed it in and returned to Norman, where he took a job at indie shop Shadowplay Records. Defenestration was no more. Chainsaw Kittens While working at Shadowplay Records, Meade met Trent Bell, ‚Äúa regular customer and loiterer,‚Äù and eventual lead guitarist to Chainsaw Kittens, who also won a Grammy as a producer in 2012. Bell informed Meade about a group of high schoolers that had a band and were about to kick out their singer. Bell suggested that Meade's songs would be perfect for the band. Meade recalled, \\"I thought it was ridiculous, but I didn't have any other options I could think of, so I decided to play the kids my songs.\\" After holding practice session for a month in 1989, Chainsaw Kittens were born, their name a nod to their trashy punk guitar sound and baby faces. [id] Along with the other founding members‚Äîguitarist Mark Metzger, bass guitarist Kevin McElhaney, and drummer Ted Leader‚ÄîChainsaw Kittens recorded a demo and received a contract offer almost immediately from Mammoth Records. Whereas in Defenestration it was all tempered with a vaguely mainstream rock sensibility, Todd Walker's main contribution to the band‚Äîthe Chainsaw Kittens dove enthusiastically off the deep end, into the extreme waters of glam-pop-punk, full-on transvestitism, and openly gay lyrics. And while it had a lot do with creative statement, it was also the work of Meade's increased understanding of his chosen industry: ‚ÄúI had a definite [idea] of what I wanted the Kittens to be,\\" Meade says. \\"I wanted to have a band that was signed and made records. A month [after getting together], we made our first demo, and a month after that we were in negotiations with Mammoth Records.‚Äù The band's inaugural album, Violent Religion, introduced Chainsaw Kittens' knack for creating fragile melodies and catchy pop choruses alongside twisted lyrics and powerful, raw guitars. The last track on Violent Religion, \\"She's Gone Mad,\\" was covered by fellow-Norman based alt-rockers, The Flaming Lips on their album The Day They Shot a Hole in the Jesus Egg. Before touring in support of their debut, guitarist Trent Bell joined Chainsaw Kittens. While on the road, the band witnessed two additional changes to the lineup; Aaron Preston took over drumming duties, while Clint McBay replaced McElhaney on bass. With the new lineup, featuring Meade, Metzger, McBay, Preston, and Bell, the band recorded their sophomore effort, Flipped Out in Singapore, for which they employed the services of Nirvana's Nevermind producer, Butch Vig. Released on Mammoth Records in 1992, the album, containing the songs \\"Connie I‚Äôve Found the Door\\" and \\"High in High School,\\" enabled the group's profile and fan base to grow. Another song from Flipped Out in Singapore, \\"She Gets\\", is featured on the soundtrack to William Friedkin's 2006 movie, Bug starring Ashley Judd. Eventually, Clint McBay and Aaron Preston left the band, both landing on the lineup of straight-and-narrow alt-rockers For Love Not Lisa, who scored a song on the 1994 soundtrack for The Crow. Meade installed Kittens-obsessed Chicagoan Matt Johnson on bass and Eric Harmon on drums, promoted Trent Bell to lead guitarist, and the Kittens set to work on their third album, Pop Heiress, with A-list producer John Agnello. Eventually because of strained relationship between Mammoth Records and Atlantic Records, Mammoth cut Chainsaw Kittens loose. Because the Smashing Pumpkins and Chainsaw Kittens had shared producers and toured together in the early 1990s, members of both bands had become friends. So when James Iha and D'arcy Wretzky of Smashing Pumpkins started their own independent label Scratchie Records, the available Chainsaw Kittens were the perfect place to start. In 1996, the Chainsaw Kittens released their self-titled album, Chainsaw Kittens, under Scratchie Records. Later, the band released a fifth full-length album, The All American, on Four Alarm Records. Despite limited exposure, The All American too received critical praise. Since 2001, Chainsaw Kittens have been on indefinite hiatus. The band reunited for a performance at the Norman Music Festival in Norman, Oklahoma on April 26, 2008. Solo career and life after the Kittens Meade has produced two full-length solo albums: Motorcycle Childhood and Kitchens and Bathrooms. He also recently collaborated with Derek Brown of The Flaming Lips and Jesse Tabish of Other Lives on a project called \\"Winter Boys.\\" Tyson performing live at CHouse (June 20, 2012) Meade resided in Shanghai, the People's Republic of China, where he teaches English. Although Meade still adores the aura of glam rock and looks back fondly on his days with Defenestration and Chainsaw Kittens, he admitted burning out as a performer. When he put aside his rock persona and shifted into more of a storyteller with a guitar, he said he fell in love with being onstage again. To this end, Meade now returns to America annually and treats his fans to the occasional concert at Chouse in Norman. He now lives back in Norman. Meade is currently set to work on a third solo album, wherein Meade will record at high schools and universities in China with students. Meade describes the project: ‚ÄúIn many ways this is diplomatic and, at the very least, a cultural exchange; in some small way. I would like people to know that Chinese people are awesome. This has become very important to me because when I talk about my love for the Chinese people I sometimes get the most heartbreaking responses from people who just do not know how much the Chinese LOVE us! I was in Shanghai and other areas of China for five years and the one thing that I learned is that the Chinese LOVE America and Americans!‚Äù Asked about being called a godfather of alternative rock music, Meade had this to say: > I hate to try to credit myself for something that I may or may not have > created. At the time, I was fed up with everything going on in music. If you > were alive in the 80s you know to what music and bands I am referring.

And, I wrote songs about my life and my inner-struggles and all > of that sort of stuff that you have going on when you are in your late teens > and early 20s. We rammed 50s guitar licks into 60s power pop colliding into > 70s glam and punk and more glam and then pureed it in a blender and we had > our sound. Soon after, a hoard of other bands did the same and called it > grunge or alternative rock. It then became a big business. I never made any > money; I have been paid in fan letters, which is really what I set out to > do. I set out to make some sort of change. And I feel as if I did. So, I > guess I am one of the alterna-Forefathers. I am a starving alterna- > Forefather.

Regulation =United States= Hyperion Wastewater Treatment Plant in Los Angeles, California is one of the largest municipal plants in the United States. Sewage treatment systems in the United States are subject to the Clean Water Act (CWA) and are regulated by federal and state environmental agencies. In most states, local sewage plants receive discharge permits from state agencies; in the remaining states and territories, permits are issued by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The treatment plants, known as publicly owned treatment works (POTW) in CWA parlance, must protect the health and welfare of the local population by ensuring that wastewater does not contaminate the local potable water supply, nor violate additional water quality standards that protect the ecological health of the water body. The basic national standard for U.S. municipal treatment plants is the Secondary Treatment Regulation.EPA (1989). \\"Secondary Treatment Regulation.\\" Code of Federal Regulations, . Most plants in the U.S. must meet this secondary treatment standard. The permit authority (state agency or EPA) can compel a POTW to meet a higher standard, if there are applicable water quality standards for the receiving water body. For water bodies with stringent standards, such as Lake Tahoe, POTWs must treat their discharges to tertiary treatment levels, and then pump all treated water out of the drainage basin so that no effluent ever drains to a certain body of water. Such higher standards may require the POTW to construct improvements to its plant(s). If not in compliance with its permit and regulations, POTWs may be subject to heavy fines. Regulation is therefore often the driving force behind increasing sewage treatment costs in the United States, and is directly linked to the high cost of constructing or expanding a sewage treatment facility. Many large cities in the U.S. operate combined sewers, which collect sewage and stormwater runoff in a single pipe system leading to the treatment plant. Combined sewers can cause serious water pollution problems due to combined sewer overflows, which are caused by large variations in flow between dry and wet weather. These overflows can lead to violation of the Secondary Treatment Regulation and/or water quality standards. Discharge permits for these POTWs typically have additional requirements that require facility improvements to reduce or eliminate the overflows. =United Kingdom= In England and Wales, Ofwat regulates charges and service standards. In England environmental standards and their achievement for sewage disposal are regulated by the Environment Agency. In Wales environmental regulation is undertaken by Natural Resources Wales. In Scotland the Scottish Environment Protection Agency fulfils the environmental regulation role and the Water Industry Commission for Scotland undertakes the economic regulatory role. Administration =United States= Sewer systems are usually administered on the local level, usually citywide, and usually by the city itself. These systems, which may operate independently or as a subdivision of a city or other municipal agency, are typically operated as Enterprises, meaning that they produce enough revenues to fund their own activities. Revenues are usually generated through two charges to customers: connection fees and use charges. Connection fees are charged once to new customers as they connect to the sanitary sewer collection system, and are usually designed to recover capital investments made by the enterprise to serve its customers. Use charges are periodic charges for ongoing use of the system, and are designed to recover operations and maintenance expenses. Both connection fees and use charges are typically proportionate to the amount and strength of wastewater expected to be generated by each customer. Therefore, a single family residence would pay much smaller fees and charges than a food processing plant. Some POTWs are eligible for low-interest loans to finance system improvements, from the Clean Water State Revolving Fund. This program is administered by EPA and state agencies, using a combination of federal and state funds.EPA (2012). \\"Clean Water State Revolving Fund.\\" =United Kingdom= In England sewerage and sewage disposal is undertaken by relatively few large private companies, including several multi-national companies. In Wales and Scotland a \\"not for profit\\" company is the responsible body, however in Wales almost all the operational work is sub-contracted by others. Charges to domestic users are based either on the metered volume of incoming water or on the notional value of the property (rateable basis).

It is situated near Loch Ossian on the Corrour Estate, Highland Region (formerly Inverness-shire), Scotland.Network Rail, http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/CRR/details.html It is the highest mainline railway station in the United Kingdom.  Location  The station is one of the most remote in the United Kingdom, at an isolated location on the northern edge of Rannoch Moor.Mountain Moor and Loch, p114. It is not accessible by any public roads. The nearest road, the B846 road from Loch Rannoch to Rannoch station, is a ten-mile (16 km) walk away by hill track, although Rannoch station itself is only 7¬º route-miles (11.5 km) away by rail.British Rail Passenger Timetable, summer 1992, p1322 Vehicular access is by a 15-mile (24 km) private road from a little west of Moy Lodge on the A86. Until the late 1980s, the only electrical power at the station was provided by batteries. The only telephone was the railway's system which linked Corrour only to the adjacent signalboxes at Rannoch and Tulloch, which were on the public telephone system.Thomas, p 65 At 1,340 ft (408 m) above sea level the station provides a starting point for hill-walkers and Munro- baggers. There is accommodation and a bar/restaurant available at the stationCorrour Station House, West Word, August 2015 issue, https://www.westword.org.uk/august2015.html and an SYHA youth hostel just over a mile (2 km) away at the head of Loch Ossian.  History  Corrour station was built by the West Highland Railway between 1893 and 1894 on its line linking Glasgow with Fort William and was operated from its opening on 7 August 1894 by the North British Railway.Thomas, chapters 3 and 4; dates from pp 64 and 170 It has a passing loop around an island platform with a siding on the east side. In common with the line‚Äôs two other remote passing places, Gorton and Glen Douglas, it was built with a tall signalbox and an adjacent low building in which the signalman lived.McGregor, p 39 The adjacent low building (in Corrour's case) was also used as a sub post office from 15 December 1896 and a Post Office telegraph office from 16 August 1898; Corrour even qualified as a post town. Later the railway constructed a station house for the signalman on the east side of the tracks and the original building became purely office accommodation for the railway and the post office. Corrour was originally intendedThomas p 135 to be merely a passing place on the long section between Rannoch and Tulloch, called Luibruaridh (sic)Mountain Moor & Loch p114 after the nearest habitation, Luibruairidh, on the old drove road between Rannoch and Spean Bridge, about 1¬Ω miles (2 km) northwest of the passing place. However, from its opening its small island platform was used as a station and the name Corrour was also usedMountain Moor & Loch, distance table in frontispiece although Corrour Lodge at that time was where the drove road crossed Coire Odhar, some 5 miles (8 km) southeast of the station. However, when the station opened estate traffic was facilitated by the building of a mile-long (1.5 km) track connecting the station to the old drove road as it passed near the head of Loch Ossian. In the early days there was so much estate business that the railway employed an extra clerkess during the grouse season. It was theoretically a private station for the use of the estate but it was also used by the public from the start despite its not appearing in the public timetables until September 1934.Thomas pp 72,73Thomas p 171 gives the date of its being open to the public as 15 September, a Saturday; Canmore 105961 gives 11 September 1934, a Tuesday, possibly following Butt Map showing location of Corrour railway station with reference to other geographical features mentioned in the article In 1897, the estate built a new lodge at the foot of Loch Ossian, 4¬Ω miles (7 km) northeast of the station. There was however no vehicular access to the lodge from the public road system so all goods (including vehicles) had to come and go by rail via Corrour station. Until the track along the south shore of Loch Ossian was built, the estate ran a small steamer from the lodge to the head of Loch Ossian (where Loch Ossian youth hostel is now) from which the station was only a little over a mile (2 km) away. In 1972 the Forestry Commission built a private macadamized road from the A86 at near Moy Lodge to Corrour Lodge, so for the first time there was vehicular access to the station, via Corrour Lodge and Moy Lodge, a total distance of 15 miles (24 km). Corrour sub post and telegraph office closed on 5 March 1977. During the construction of the Lochaber hydroelectric scheme in the 1930s a small halt was located at Fersit, between Corrour and Tulloch, about 2 miles (3 km) short of the latter. Corrour station from the south in March 1982, showing the original station house and the footbridge before its removal to Rannoch Since November 1985, all passenger trains have used the original ‚Äúdown‚Äù platform. The \\"up\\" loop remains and is serviceable but it is no longer used by passenger trains. There was originally a footbridge at Corrour station providing an exit to the east side, but it was moved to Rannoch station following the downgrading of the \\"up\\" loop at Corrour. Passengers now cross the line by a barrow crossing. In 1998/1999 Corrour Estate replaced the former signalman‚Äôs house with a new station house. This included business premises and lodging for their managers and had electric power from a diesel generator. The station house subsequently had a number of tenants over the years becoming an independent hostel, an SYHA hostel (in addition to the SYHA‚Äôs nearby hostel at Loch Ossian), and a restaurant. In 2015, the estate took over the running of the building and after closure for refurbishment reopened it as a bar and restaurant. In 2012, the red stone chippings on the platform, which Network Rail acknowledged would be hazardous to wheelchair passengers, were replaced by a hard surface. In 2013, Historic Scotland listed the disused signalbox (called the \\"old watchtower\\" by Network Rail) and the adjacent building as Category C (the tall boxes at Gorton and Glen Douglas had been demolished). Subsequently, Network Rail, in conjunction with the Corrour Estate and the Railway Heritage Trust, refurbished the signalbox and in 2016 the estate opened three guest rooms in it.  Facilities  The 3-character code for Corrour is CRR. Corrour is unstaffed and there are no ticket-issuing facilities, but there is a validator for a \\"smartcard\\" paperless card-based ticketing system. There are no departure announcements but there is WiFi, a telephone help point, an electronic departure display and a Caledonian Sleeper digital information point. There is a waiting room with bench seats and a cycle rack. The station is lit by electric lights.  Services  A train to Mallaig Corrour station is now passenger-only and is served by regular Abellio ScotRail passenger trains between Glasgow Queen Street and Fort William/Mallaig. These local services run generally three times a day in each direction, but less frequently on Sundays (twice each way in summer, but just once in winter). In addition, Corrour is served by the Caledonian Sleeper service between Fort William and London Euston via Glasgow Queen Street (Low Level) and Edinburgh (daily except Saturday nights in each direction). The journey from London to Corrour takes just under twelve hours. The sleeper also conveys seated coaches and can therefore also be used by regular West Highland passengers travelling to or from Glasgow or Edinburgh. Although National Rail state that Corrour is a request stop, Scotrail's 2019-20 timetable shows it as a compulsory stop. Its estimated usage of 14,344 (2018‚Äì19) made it the busiest station on the line north of Crianlarich, apart from Fort William and Mallaig.  Signalling  Corrour station from the north, in April 2004 The signal box, which had 13 levers, was situated to the south of the island platform. From the time of its opening in 1894, the West Highland Railway was worked throughout by the electric token system. The semaphore signals were removed in November 1985 in preparation for the introduction of Radio Electronic Token Block (RETB). At the same time, the loop points came under the control of ground frames. The RETB system was commissioned by British Rail between and Fort William Junction on 29 May 1988. This resulted in the closure of Corrour signal box and others on that part of the route. The RETB is controlled from a Signalling Centre at Banavie railway station.  Cultural references  The station, and the nearby mountain Leum Uilleim, gained fame when they were featured in a scene from the film Trainspotting. It also appeared in the fourth episode of the 2010 BBC series Secret Britain. The station also featured in the Young Guns video for the single \\"Weight of the World\\". The station is the primary location in Jos Stelling's film De Wisselwachter. It was also visited by Paul Merton in Episode 3 of his Channel 4 documentary series Paul Merton's Secret Stations. Channel 4 Programme Information website; Retrieved 16 May 2016 The route south from Corrour across the Moor of Rannoch to Rannoch Station itself was used as a filming location in the Harry Potter films where a Death Eater was seen to stand between the rails with an outstretched arm, to bring the approaching Hogwarts Express to a stand for the train to be inspected. Warner Brothers spent a couple of days with equipment based at Rannoch to facilitate the filming sequences.  References  = Sources =  * McGregor, John A., All Stations to Mallaig, D.

Postal notes were the specialized money order successors to the United States Department of the Treasury's postage and fractional currency. They were created so Americans could safely and inexpensively (for a three cent fee) send sums of money under $5 to distant places.The Comprehensive Catalog of U.S. Paper Money, by Gene Hessler, Fifth Edition, Pages 387-389 Postal Notes were privately produced by three different firms in six design types during three four-year contracts. Developed under Postmaster General Walter Q. Gresham, they were first issued at the nation's post offices on Monday, September 3, 1883. Numerous \\"first day\\" souvenir notes have survived.A Forgotten Chapter: The United States Postal Note, by Nicholas Bruyer, Paper Money, #48-51, Fourth quarter 1973 - May 1974 Government officials, wary of the continuing problem of postal theft, initially mandated that the notes could be cashable only in the city named by the purchaser. Engraved and printed by the Homer Lee Bank Note Company, the first two designs (Types I and II) had a space for the postal clerk to indicate where the note was being sent. If stolen en route, the note had no value, as it could not be cashed in any other city. All Postal Notes were printed on a watermarked security paper produced by Crane & Co. that features a unique watermark. Type I notes were printed on a yellow security paper blank that was about 10% larger than all subsequent issues. Type II and later notes were printed on a creamy white security paper. In January 1887, Congress changed the applicable law. Rather than being cashable at only one named post office, it decided that newly issued Postal Notes could be cashable at any money order office ‚Äì the system's larger and busier offices. To comply with the new law, \\"Any Money Order Office\\" was rubber-stamped or hand written in place of a specific paying city on the Type II forms. These notes are called Type II-A. To comply with the law, Homer Lee's engravers added the words \\"ANY MONEY ORDER OFFICE\\" in a level line into the second design's printing plates. Due to the short period of time between the passage of the new law and the start of the second production contract (which Homer Lee did not receive), few post offices ordered and issued Type III Postal Notes. The American Bank Note Company of New York was the winning bidder for the second Postal Note engraving and printing contract. Thomas F. Morris, creator of the acclaimed designs for U.S. currency and stamps, as well as stock and bond certificates, etc., was assigned to design and engrave the new Postal Note (Type IV).The Life and Work of Thomas F. Morris, 1852-1898 by T.F. Morris II, 1968 No major changes were required during American's four-year contract.

History An Ocado van parked on a busy road in Central London Ocado was founded in April 2000 as L.M. Solutions by Jonathan Faiman, Jason Gissing and Tim Steiner, former merchant bankers with Goldman Sachs. In October 2000, Ocado partnered with Waitrose. In June 2001, the company changed its name to Ocado Limited. In 2002, the company started its commercial delivery service. In September 2006, Michael Grade became non-executive chairman of Ocado, shortly after Goldman Sachs were appointed as financial advisers, fuelling speculation which had already started about a listing for the company. In November 2008, the John Lewis Partnership transferred its shareholding of 29% into its staff pension fund. In May 2010, the John Lewis Partnership entered into a 10-year branding and supply agreement with Ocado. In February 2011, the John Lewis pension fund sold off its entire Ocado shareholding.

On 19 April 2010, the company extended the app to Android devices. In 2015, Ocado launched the first grocery app for the Apple Watch. In July 2010, Ocado undertook an initial public offering. In 2015, Ocado launched the Ocado Smart Platform, its own software for operating retail businesses online. In August 2017, Ocado launched an app for Amazon's Alexa voice assistant, that allowed users to add products to an existing Ocado order or basket via voice command. The company stated it was the first UK supermarket to launch an app for Alexa. In November 2017, Ocado's shares rose by 20% following the fulfillment of an Ocado Smart Platform deal with the French Casino Group. In January 2018, Ocado completed negotiations for an Ocado Smart Platform deal with the Canadian supermarket chain Sobeys, owned by Empire Company. Michael Medline, CEO of Empire and Sobeys, said its e-commerce business, including robotics system for home deliveries, would start in approximately two years. In May 2018, Ocado signed an Ocado Smart Platform deal with Kroger, the US retail company, to build up to 20 Customer Fulfillment Centres (CFCs) using Ocado's automated technologies. As of November 2019, five locations had been identified for the new CFCs, and two were under construction. On 5 February 2019, Ocado's customer fulfilment centre (CFC) in Andover, Hampshire, which handles 10 per cent of its fulfilments, caught fire. The fire continued to burn the following day, engaging more than 25 fire engines and 300 firefighters from multiple fire services. A 500-metre exclusion zone was set up and residents as far as 1.6 km away were evacuated as a precaution. The fire burned for more than 3 days, with the roof collapsing in the process. On 27 February 2019, Ocado and Marks and Spencer announced a Joint Venture, whereby M&S; acquired a 50% share in Ocado's UK retail business. On 4 June 2019, Computerworld UK reported Ocado's intent to use robotic packers to handle its stock, utilizing technology developed in collaboration with SOMA, the Soft Manipulation consortium. In March 2020, Ocado warned of delays as customers were buying particularly large orders amid reports of panic-buying across the UK over fears of the coronavirus pandemic. On 18 March, Ocado announced that it was suspending its service, citing higher demand for deliveries than it was able to meet. On 29 March, the company said that they had spent ¬£1.5 million on ordering 100,000 COVID-19 testing kits for its staff, with an aim to keep grocery supplies flowing. This was intended to protect both their staff and the UK public, but the company promised to hand them over to the NHS if required. British supermarkets Ocado's warehouse in Hatfield Ocado's products include own brand groceries from the Marks and Spencer supermarket chain as well as their own Ocado brand, but also a selection of name brand groceries and other items, including flowers, toys and magazines. Until September 2020, Ocado sold Waitrose products alongside their own, however, the 10-year supply and branding deal signed in 2010 expired and Ocado began a joint venture with Marks & Spencer instead. Deliveries were temporarily suspended following a \\"surge in demand\\" when the venture was first announced. Since January 2014, Ocado have provided the website, warehousing and delivery services for one of their main grocery rivals Morrisons supermarkets, allowing them to operate online using Ocado's network of depots to deliver Morrisons groceries to online customers. The fulfilment of Morrisons.com grocery website customer orders comes from Ocado's Dordon Customer Fulfilment Centre (CFC) in the Midlands, with deliveries brought to the customer's doorstep via Morrisons liveried fleet. Morrisons made an initial capital payment of up to ¬£170m to Ocado to acquire the Dordon site and associated mechanical handling equipment, as well as a licence and integration fee. A further ¬£46m was invested to expand Dordon in order to accommodate Morrisons range, integrate with Morrisons systems and establish a network of delivery spokes. On an annual basis, Morrisons pay service costs and a contribution to research and development expenditure.  Technology  Robots inside an Ocado warehouse Ocado Technology logo Ocado Technology, a division of Ocado Group, designs most of Ocado's technology in-house, including but not limited to: website and apps; automated warehouses and robots; Machine Learning-based fraud detection and customer service systems; forecasting and routing systems. They describe themselves as specialists in: automation and robotics; big data and the cloud; web and app development; algorithms and smart optimisation; and discrete event-simulation. Ocado's warehouses are built with a giant 3D grid structure inside, within which groceries are stored in crates. On top, robots (over 1,000 per warehouse) coordinate in swarm-like behaviour to collect and move the crates. The robots bring the crates up from the grid into their interior and take them to pickers so the groceries inside the crate can be packed into orders. They then move the crate back into the grid. The robots can work together to 'dig' for the crates, moving crates out of the way to collect one buried lower in a stack. The movement of the robots and the storage location of the crates is managed and optimised by a central 'control system' using Artificial Intelligence. In this way, Ocado can pick a 50 item order in minutes. These 'hive' style warehouses are located in Andover and Erith. The Erith site is 36 acres, capable of processing 220,000 orders a week, with up to 3,500 robots running on its grid. Ocado's older warehouses, located in Hatfield and Dordon, are based on a complex conveyor system and use Artificial Intelligence to plan and optimise picking sequence, product location, and crate routing. Ocado Technology was involved in two EU-funded Horizon 2020 robotics research projects: SecondHands and SOMA and continues to experiment with robotics for automating picking and packing of grocery orders. Ocado has six technology development centres in Europe: Hatfield and London in the UK; Krak√≥w and Wroclaw in Poland; Sofia in Bulgaria; Barcelona in Spain. In 2014, volunteers from Ocado Technology founded Code for Life, an initiative to provide schools with free resources for teaching coding.  Ocado Smart Platform  The Ocado Smart Platform is Ocado's hardware and software platform for operating retail businesses online. It is this side-step from being a UK grocer into becoming a global technology provider that has seeded some analysts predictions of a ¬£100 share price by 2030 Clients include the following supermarket chains: Morrisons (UK); ICA (Sweden); Group Casino (France); Sobeys (Canada); Kroger (USA) and Bon Preu (Spain).

It was danced solo or by couples. Originating among African Americans in the rural South, the black bottom eventually was adopted by mainstream American culture and became a national craze in the 1920s. The dance was most famously performed by Ann Pennington, a star of the Ziegfeld Follies, who performed it in a Broadway revue staged by Ziegfeld's rival George White in 1926. Origins Sheet music for the \\"new dance sensation\\", the Black Bottom The dance originated in New Orleans in the first decade of the 20th century. The jazz pianist and composer Jelly Roll Morton, wrote the tune \\"Black Bottom Stomp\\", its title referring to the Black Bottom area of Detroit. Sheet music from the mid-20s identifies the composers as Gus Horsley and Perry Bradford and claims the dance was introduced by the African-American dancer and choreographer Billy Pierce. The sheet music's cover photograph features dancer Stella Doyle, who performed primarily in cabarets. The black bottom was well known among semirural blacks across the South. A similar dance with many variations was commonly performed in tent shows, and \\"Bradford and Jeanette\\" had used it as a finale. The dance was featured in the Harlem show Dinah in 1924 and was then performed by Ann Pennington and Tom Patricola in the musical comedy revue George White's Scandals of 1926 on Broadway, whereupon it became a national craze. The black bottom overtook the Charleston in popularity and eventually became the number one social dance. Some dance critics noted that by the time it became a fad in American society in the mid-20s, it resembled the Charleston. Both dances can be performed solo or as a couple and feature exuberant moves. The African-American choreographer Billy Pierce, who is credited on \\"Black Bottom Dance\\" sheet music with having introduced the dance, was an associate with the African-American choreographer Buddy Bradley. Working out of Pierce's dance studio in New York City, Bradley devised dance routines for Tom Pericola and other Broadway performers. A different musical accompaniment composed by Ray Henderson with new lyrics from Buddy DeSylva and Lew Brown also briefly became a nationwide sensation and was widely recorded.Kantor, Michael & Laurence Maslon, Broadway: the American musical. N.Y. Bulfinch Press 2004 pp. 89-90; 96-7. An evocative recreation of that version by choreographer Rod Alexander was featured in the 1956 biopic The Best Things in Life Are Free performed by Sheree North and Jacques d‚ÄôAmboise leading a stage full of flappers and tuxedoed Johnnies. Dance steps The rhythm of the black bottom is based on the Charleston. Bradford's version, printed with the sheet music, gave these instructions: Hop down front then doodle back [doodle means \\"slide\\"] Mooch to your left then mooch to the right Hands on your hips and do the mess around, Break a leg until you're near the ground [break a leg is a hobbling step] Now that's the old black bottom dance Instructions for the mooch are \\"Shuffle forward with both feet. Hips go first, then feet.\\" Broadway historians Kantor and Maslon describe it as a ‚Äòfairly simple step punctuated by a slap on the rear end‚Äô with the hobbling step akin to pulling your feet out of the deep muddy waters of the Swanee.Kantor & Maslon p.90. The Alexander recreation expanded this into having his dance partners cheekily bump their posteriors together; although there is no evidence to suggest that was part of the original dance. Legacy \\"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom\\", a song by Ma Rainey, makes obvious allusions to the dance but is not itself dance music. Ma Rainey's Black Bottom is the title of a 1982 play by August Wilson, about exploits and experiences of African Americans. The comedy musician Spike Jones, who became popular in the 1940s, performed a jaunty cover of the black bottom. His version, released on 78-RPM records, repeated a single measure of a piano solo in the middle of the song several times, each time continuing with a loud \\"crack!\\" as a joke to make the record sound broken. The dance was featured in the 1927 Austrian silent film Caf√© Elektric. Judy Garland repeats vocal refrains from the song while hoofing in some chorus girl lines in a montage sequence from A Star Is Born (1954 film).

Along with William Ellery Channing, he was the leader of mainstream Unitarianism of the early and middle 19th century, and was known as the \\"Unitarian Pope\\". He was the father of the writer Charles Eliot Norton. Biography In his early career, Andrews Norton helped to establish liberal Unitarianism in New England, and stridently opposed harshly conservative Calvinism and Trinitarianism. Nevertheless, later in life, he became the chief conservative Unitarian opponent of Transcendentalism. As a vocal and well- published theologian, he earned from some the joking title of \\"the Unitarian Pope\\". He was born in Hingham, Massachusetts, son of Samuel Norton. Norton graduated from Harvard University in 1804 and continued as a graduate student and lecturer there and at Bowdoin College. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1815. He was named Dexter Lecturer on Biblical Criticism in 1813, and in 1819, Harvard made him the first Dexter Professor of Sacred Literature, a position he held until 1830; he also served as Harvard College Librarian from 1813 to 1821. Andrews Norton attacks Transcendentalism in a caricature by Christopher Pearse Cranch, ca. 1836-1838 Norton engaged in vigorous debates with George Ripley in 1836 and Ralph Waldo Emerson in 1838 (over Emerson's Divinity School Address).

It was released in 1992 by the Steepler company. The Dendy was easily the most popular video game console of its time in former USSR region and enjoyed a degree of fame roughly equivalent to that experienced by the NES/Famicom in North America and Japan. In 1992, Dendy was selling in the Russian Federation for 39,000 rubles (roughly 70‚Äì80 USDPichugin, Igor Z. \\"Steepler –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª –ø—Ä–æ–¥–∞–≤–∞—Ç—å Dendy ‚Äî –ú–æ—Å–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∞—è —Ñ–∏—Ä–º–∞ –Ω–∞—á–∏–Ω–∞–µ—Ç –±–æ–ª—å—à—É—é –≤–∏–¥–µ–æ–∏–≥—Ä—É\\". Kommersant. 18 December 1992.); by 1994, over one million Dendy units were sold in Russia, and the price was roughly $35.  History  Victor Savyuk () first heard about Nintendo in 1991 when it was enjoying great commercial success with the NES console in Japan and the Western world. Hoping to repeat this success in Russia in the period immediately following the collapse of the USSR, Savyuk began importing counterfeit consoles from Asia to Russia. Although it was already possible to buy Famicom clones and NES consoles from local distributors, Savyuk began making plans to invent, register and promote his own brand. Seeking a company in Moscow that would be able to manage sales and distribution locally, in 1992 he stumbled upon Steepler () which agreed to manage this aspect of the business. The new console would be called the Dendy () and its logo was created by Ivan Maximov.https://secretmag.ru/business/trade-secret/nintendo-so-slonom-kak- viktor-savyuk-pridumal-pristavku-dendy.htm The Dendy first appeared on the market in December 1992, selling at the price of 39,000 rubles (). Marketing for the console led to a series of animated television advertisements with the phrase \\"Dendy, Dendy! We all love Dendy! Dendy ‚Äì everyone plays!\\" Later, a TV show was launched called \\"Dendy - The New Reality\\". By April 1993, Steepler had four regional distributors and had generated 500 million rubles in revenue (equivalent to US$ million in ). For a while, the Dendy's main competitors were similar products from China. It was not until November 1993 that a competitors, the Sega consoles imported by Nisho Iwai and distributed by Forrus, were introduced to the market.http://game- exe.org/index.php?n=Exe.Exe001InterviewSEGA Steepler reorganized in early 1994, resulting in the separation and creation of the Lamport company, which later manufactured the Kenga, another Famicom Clone. By mid-1994, Steepler had already sold 1 million Dendy consoles and was selling between 100,000 and 125,000 more per month with a revenue of $5 million. At this time, the price of the consoles had dropped to roughly $30‚Äì$35. In August 1994, Incombank and Steepler announced plans to start up a joint business venture called Dendy, in which Incombank would contribute capital and receive 30% of profits. At the end of 1994, two more Dendy rivals (also NES clones) appeared: the Kenga, manufactured by Lamport, and the Bitman, distributed by R-Style and Subor ().http://gamenotes.ru/history/bitman-consoles/ In November 1994, the newly created Dendy company signed an agreement with Nintendo, in which they were forbidden from promoting Sega products and given exclusive distribution rights to the SNES in Russia. After the collapse of Steepler in 1996, the subsidiary AOZT Dendy continued to sell the console. The company ceased operations in 1998.http://tv-games.ru/wiki/Companies/Dendy.html Modern Dendy consoles, which can still be found alongside Chinese products in many markets, are manufactured in China and have no relation to the Steepler company. They are also lower quality clones using NOAC SoCs which suffer from various issues, the most common one being no expansion audio (something the Dendy Jr suffered from). Many also have the 25% and 50% pulse waves swapped. Dendy consoles had cloned but otherwise separate CPU and PPU. According to one version, Steepler signed a contract with Nintendo agreeing to sell not only consoles, but game cartridges as well. Given that licensed cartridges cost several times more than pirated ones, Steepler soon found that it was unable to sell them profitably, resulting in the company's demise.  Technical specifications  The technical specifications of the Dendy are mostly consistent with those of the PAL version of the NES, but there are some differences in design and execution. = Processor = * 6527P, Ricoh 2A03-compatible. 8-bit, 1.773447 MHz. The exact chipset and implementation differed depending on the model and time of release (while maintaining software compatibility). Most often in the console were two chips manufactured by UMC ‚Äî UA6527P (CPU) and UA6538 (PPU), which have been integrated to be compatible with the 6502 processor and the rest of the logic. Later editions consolidated the design of all previous implementations into a single, open-frame chip. = Sound = * Built-in pAPU, 5 channels. = Savegames = No Dendy cartridges were made which would contain battery-backed saves. No games that relied on that were sold, like most long RPGs.  Models  Dendy was produced in two main configurations: Dendy Classic and Dendy Junior. They have different console and controller designs. The Dendy Classic I and II models were rebranded variations of the Micro Genius IQ-501 and IQ-502 respectively, manufactured by TXC Corporation in Taiwan. The Dendy Junior was designed to resemble the Famicom. These are then divided into more subconfigurations, like Dendy Junior II, Dendy Junior IIP, Dendy Junior IVP, Dendy Classic II which may not be completely consistent between batches or regions. Dendy has two video outputs, RF- (antenna) output, preset on Russia's second main television channel frequency, and composite RCA. Some consoles can be compatible with the PAL television standard, others with SECAM. Both the Classic and Junior variants may have one or two controllers packed in the box, with controllers being also sold separately. (Other designs of the gamepads were present in the market, different shapes including resembling that of the Sega Genesis.) \\"Junior\\" gamepads can have front- or side-outcoming cable, and on the part of the console hard-wired or detachable. The sockets could be front or side. (Always side on Classic.) Systems with hard-wired controllers always had two of them, with an additional socket for light gun. The Junior may or may not have Start and Select buttons on the second controller, but it does have turbo buttons. They never have a microphone. Classic's pads always have Start and Select, and also always have turbo buttons. The turbo speed, according to advertising booklets by Steepler, differs, the Junior being 7 repeats per second, Classic 20 per second. The Dendies with a P suffix in their name include a light gun.

Just like with the Famicom, the original NES cartridges are mechanically incompatible with the Dendy console due to a different form factor of the PCB and the outer hull. Most of the games sold for Dendy consoles have been bootlegs or copies of classic NES games. Among them are multicarts, sometimes with a few games replicated many times or separated by levels with ability to choose any of them, sometimes with the sprites or maps slightly altered. There are very few original Russian, Taiwanese or Chinese products, as they are most notable for pirated and bootlegged products. Among the games is the Super Mario Bros. series, which includes the three original Mario productions from Nintendo, along with a series of unlicensed Mario games, most of which are just other Famicom games with the main character replaced with Mario sprites. Examples of an originally programmed (but still trademark-infringing) game include the infamous Somari, which is a port of Sonic the Hedgehog with Sonic's sprite replaced by Mario's, and another one is the unlicensed 8-bit clone of the SNES's Super Mario World game.  Reception  Dendy prices during 1992 began at 39,000 rubles (roughly $94). In relation to contemporary income levels, prices in this range were the equivalent of several months' salary, and this effectively put the Dendy out of reach of most individuals.Schillinger, Liesl. \\"News - Forum: The death of childhood in Russia.\\" The Ottawa Citizen. Pg.B3. 24 October 1993. As sales increased, however, Steepler was able to reduce prices such that by 1994 with over one million Dendy units sold, the price had dropped to roughly $35. As for the sale of Dendy, most sources say that from 1.5 to 2 million consoles were sold in Russia.https://www.computerra.ru/263121/istoriya-dendy-kak- spiratit-tseluyu-konsol/ Some sources say that around 6 million consoles were sold in Russia and in the other former USSR countries.https://secretmag.ru/business/trade-secret/nintendo-so-slonom-kak- viktor-savyuk-pridumal-pristavku-dendy.htm In Russia in the modern day, nostalgia-oriented retrogaming enthusiasm has provoked a resurgence of interest in the Dendy console.Toohey, Nathan. \\"Retro-kitsch in Moscow's time machine.\\" The Moscow News. 11 March 2010.

Business background and history McColls shop in York McColls shop in Larkhall, Bath In November 1998, RS McColl became part of TM Retail when Forbuoys (a subsidiary of TM Retail) acquired Martin Retail Group, creating Great Britain's largest chain of newsagents. In addition to RS McColl, TM Retail's former trading names include; Forbuoys, Martin's, Dillons (purchased from One Stop Stores Ltd following the takeover by Tesco of parent company T&S; Stores),Dillons Stores Ltd sold to TM Retail McColls and More. In 2006, TM Retail was renamed Martin McColl Limited,TM Retail rebranded after a management buyout. The various stores were then rebranded variously as Martin's (news and variety stores) or McColl's (convenience stores). The only exceptions were the Scottish stores where the RS McColl name was retained. With this re branding, all other names the company operates under were removed, these included Martins the Newsagents, More, Forbuoys and Dillons. From 2009 to 2010, Martin McColl Limited underwent a multi million pound EPOS refit within their stores, replacing their existing EPOS system with a new multi screen touch screen system. It was hoped this would speed up the transaction process by incorporating Credit/Debit card systems within the EPOS. The multi screen system allows advertising POS to be electronically displayed to customers during the time that they are at the till. By 2011, expansion for the new system had been developed, with the addition of built in PayPoint terminals known as PPOD During 2012 to 2013, a barcode system was implemented to scan lottery tickets through the till making transactions more accurate and reducing the chances of human error. Martin McColl began another rebrand making the stores more appealing to customers and changed their POS format to go with the new brand. Martin McColl worked hard to give better deals to the customer and ensure the customer had a good experience through better deals and better communication with staff and customers.Martin McColl in PayPoint roll-out In March 2013, Martin McColl's implemented a company wide change in the colouring of SEL's and POS, opting for 'ivory' SEL strips and a mixture of block coloured red and white POS material.

Plot Set in the historical Charenton Asylum, Marat/Sade is almost entirely a \\"play within a play\\". The main story takes place on 13 July 1808, after the French Revolution; the play directed by the Marquis de Sade within the story takes place during the Revolution, in the middle of 1793, culminating in the assassination of Jean- Paul Marat (which took place on 13 July 1793), then quickly brings the audience up to date (1808). The actors are the inmates of the asylum; the nurses and supervisors occasionally step in to restore order. The bourgeois director of the hospital, Coulmier, supervises the performance, accompanied by his wife and daughter. He is a supporter of the post-revolutionary government led by Napoleon, in place at the time of the production, and believes the play he has organised to be an endorsement of his patriotic views. His patients, however, have other ideas, and they make a habit of speaking lines he had attempted to suppress, or deviating entirely into personal opinion. They, as people who came out of the revolution no better than they went in, are not entirely pleased with the course of events as they occurred. The Marquis de Sade, the man after whom sadism is named, did indeed direct performances in Charenton with other inmates there, encouraged by Coulmier. De Sade is a main character in the play, conducting many philosophical dialogues with Marat and observing the proceedings with sardonic amusement. He remains detached and cares little for practical politics and the inmates' talk of right and justice; he simply stands by as an observer and an advocate of his own nihilistic and individualist beliefs. Musical score Marat/Sade is a play with music. The use of music follows the approach of Brecht, whereby the songs comment on themes and issues of the play. Unlike a traditional musical format, the songs do not further the plot or expositional development of character in the play. By contrast they often add an alienation effect, interrupting the action of the play and offering historical, social and political commentary. Richard Peaslee composed music for the original English-language production of Marat/Sade directed by Peter Brook. Although there is no official score to the play in any language, the success of the Brook-directed Royal Shakespeare Company production and film made the Peaslee score popular for English- language productions. Sections of the Peaslee score have been included in trade copies of the Geoffrey Skelton/Adrian Mitchell English version (based on the text used for the Royal Shakespeare Company productions). The full score is available from ECS Publishing/Galaxy Music Corporation. The original Royal Shakespeare Company production was so popular that folk singer Judy Collins recorded a medley of songs from the show on her album In My Life.

The first recording of the show was a three-LP set released in 1964 by Caedmon Records. This was a complete audio recording of the original London production. The second release was a single soundtrack album LP of the film score, released by Caedmon/United Artists Records. The third release was a CD compilation of two 1966 Brook/Peaslee Royal Shakespeare Company productions: Marat/Sade and US, released by Premier Recordings. The songs included on this 1992 CD were: # Homage to Marat # The Corday Waltz # Song and Mime of Corday's Arrival in Paris # The People's Reaction # Those Fat Monkeys # Poor Old Marat # One Day It Will Come to Pass # Poor Marat in Your Bathtub Seat # Poor Old Marat (Reprise) # Copulation Round # Fifteen Glorious Years (interpolating the \\"Marseillaise\\") # Finale This track listing omits Royal Anthem (which appears on all other recordings) and does not specifically mention The Tumbrel Song either individually or as a part of Song and Mime of Corday's Arrival in Paris. The cast of this recording includes Patrick Magee, Glenda Jackson and Freddie Jones. (The accompanying production, US, is about an American soldier \\"zappin' the [Viet] Cong\\" in the Vietnam War.) Productions In 1964 the play was translated by Geoffrey Skelton with lyric adaptation by Adrian Mitchell and staged by the Royal Shakespeare Company. Peter Brook directed a cast that included Ian Richardson as the herald, Clive Revill as Marat, Patrick Magee as de Sade and Glenda Jackson as Charlotte Corday. After two previews, the Broadway production opened on 27 December 1965 at the Martin Beck Theatre and ran for 145 performances. Richardson took over the role of Marat, while Magee and Jackson reprised the roles they had originated in London. The play won the Tony Award for Best Play, and Brook was named Best Director. Additional awards went to Magee for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Play and Gunilla Palmstierna-Weiss for her Costume Design. Jackson lost the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play to Zoe Caldwell. It also won the 1966 New York Drama Critics' Circle Award for Best Play. In Australia, the play was directed by Edgar Metcalfe in 1966 at the Playhouse Theatre in Perth. It played for six weeks. The cast included Alan Lander as Marat and Eileen Colocott as Charlotte Corday. Other cast members included Peter Collingwood as the Marquis de Sade, James Beattie, Rosemary Barr, Peter Morris, Chris Johnson, Ken Gregory and Roland Rocchiccioli. The set was designed by Ted Dombowski. Other notable productions * In October 1969 the Virginia Museum Theater (VMT) opened its season with the play under the direction of Keith Fowler, thus inaugurating Fowler's artistic directorship which established the first LORT company in Richmond and led to the period of VMT's national and international acclaim. Marat/Sade was the first racially integrated company in VMT's history, and the community's response to the production expressed the controversy that Weiss's script often generated in America's regional theaters: the two major Richmond newspapers published \\"rave reviews\\" in favor of the show, and at the same time the editor of the afternoon paper, the News Leader, attacked the production fiercely for evincing \\"latitudinarianism.\\"\\"The Thing at the Museum\\", Richmond News Leader, October 10, 1969. * In 2006 The Blue House Theater Company presented Marat/Sade at the Sacred Fools theater in Los Angeles. The production was directed by Patrick J. Adams with an original score by Joshua Charney. It won an LA Weekly Theater Award for production of the year. * An all-male production of the play was presented in 2007 at the Classical Theatre of Harlem in New York, under the direction of Christopher McElroen. * In 2011 the Royal Shakespeare Company staged a revival of the play as part of the company's 50th anniversary celebrations. The revival was directed by Anthony Neilson and ran from 14 October to 11 November. Film adaptation The 1967 film adaptation featured many of the original players, and utilized the long version of the play's name in its opening credits, although this was frequently shortened to Marat/Sade in publicity materials. The screenplay was written by Adrian Mitchell. Brook directed a cast that included Richardson, Magee, Jackson, Jones and Clifford Rose.

The play premiered in London at the Duchess Theatre in 1938 with Williams portraying Morgan Evans. The original Broadway production starred Ethel Barrymore and premiered at the National Theatre on November 26, 1940, running for 477 performances.  Plot  Ethel Barrymore in the original Broadway production of The Corn Is Green (1940) L.C. Moffat is a strong-willed English school teacher working in a poverty-stricken coal mining village in late 19th century Wales. She struggles to win the local Welsh miners over to her English ways, and an illiterate teenager by the name of Morgan Evans eventually graduates with honours. Background Born in 1905, Emlyn Williams grew up in the impoverished coal-mining town of Mostyn in Flintshire, Wales, and spoke only Welsh until the age of eight. He was barely literate, and later said he would probably have begun working in the mines at age 12 if he had not caught the attention of a London social worker named Sarah Grace Cooke. She established a school in Mostyn in 1915, and recognized Williams' aptitude for languages. Over the next seven years she worked with him on his English and helped him prepare to be a teacher. She obtained a scholarship for him in Switzerland, to study French, and when he was 17 she helped him win a scholarship at Christ Church, Oxford. During his studies there Williams had a nervous breakdown, but Cooke encouraged him to write as a way to recover. His first play, Full Moon, was produced while he was still at Oxford. His first success, A Murder Has Been Announced, was staged in 1930, followed by the hit thriller, Night Must Fall (1935). The Corn Is Green is considered Williams' most enduring literary credit.

Adaptations  In 1945, a film adaptation was made with Bette Davis (herself of Welsh descent) as Moffat. In the late 1970s, Davis returned to the role in a musical stage adaptation that proved to be a disaster. The setting was changed to the American South, with the young man transformed into an African-American field worker (portrayed by Dorian Harewood). When the pre- Broadway run opened in Philadelphia, critics were unimpressed. Plans for revisions were cut short when Davis fell ill, and the show closed abruptly after eight performances. The musical later was staged for a short run in Indianapolis with Ginger Rogers as Miss Moffat. A 1979 made-for-television movie, directed by George Cukor and starring Katharine Hepburn, was filmed on location in Wales.

Through regular gatherings, members gain knowledge and experience in the preparation and presentation of various fine cuisines under the direction a recognized chef invited to lead the event.  Marmitons History  The tradition of a group of gentlemen inviting master chefs to lead them in preparing elaborate meals began in Europe many years ago, and was introduced to North America over thirty years ago by Swiss immigrants. The word ‚ÄúMarmitons‚Äù is French and means a kitchen boy, or chef‚Äôs helper. The first North American Chapter of Les Marmitons was established in Montreal in 1977. Since then, the interest in learning more about fine cuisine has led to the founding of over a dozen additional Chapters throughout Canada and the United States. Members of any one Chapter are always welcome to attend regular gatherings of any other Chapter - a welcome membership benefit for those who may travel between club cities.  Marmitons Events  Each chapter of Les Marmitons holds a minimum of eight regular monthly events each year. These are usually weekday evening gatherings during which members prepare and enjoy a four to six course gastronomic experience under the direction and guidance of an invited chef. Several special events are scheduled during the year, a favorite for many Chapters being the December Dinner, a repast prepared by members and then enjoyed by both members and their spouses or guests. In the Spring, with the guidance of the Les Marmitons International Executive, one of the Chapters hosts the Annual Event, inviting members of all chapters to a weekend of gastronomie in one of the club cities.  The Monthly Event  A typical regular event of Les Marmitons begins around six in the evening as members gather to meet the guest chef and hear the chef explain the gourmet menu created for the evening. Teams of members are then formed and each team assumes the responsibility to prepare one of the courses and to serve it to the members and guest chef. During preparation, the chef moves throughout the kitchen providing guidance to each team. Team members for one course also have ample opportunity to learn the techniques and special preparation tips for the other courses. Except for some final, finishing touches, the major preparation is completed by 8:30 and, accompanied by a wine that has been selected to complement or enhance each course, members sit to enjoy the fruits of their labor. During the meal, the preparation and presentation of each course is explained by the team, and the chef provides additional comment and constructive critique. At the end of the meal, the guest chef provides his final summation and members show their appreciation for the creativity, professionalism and freely given time of the chef. A quick clean-up brings the evening to a close about eleven o‚Äôclock.  Event Reservations  Depending on the Chapter, members are required to reserve their attendance, and the attendance of any guest, a week or two in advance of any regular monthly event. Once reservations have been made for the event, the member is responsible to pay the event fee for himself and his guest whether or not the member or guest attends, unless the reservations are canceled well in advance of the event. Event fees are set each year and are usually less than the cost of a similar meal in a fine restaurant.  Membership  Members in good standing may invite a guest to attend any of the regular Events of the Chapter. After having attended three regular monthly events, a prospective member may be eligible to be inducted into Les Marmitons, subject to approval of the Executive Board. Upon acceptance for membership, a new member will pay a nominal New Member Fee to cover the cost of the annual dues as well as the purchase of the Les Marmitons uniform jacket, hat and medallion. Members maintain their good standing by keeping annual dues and event fees current and supporting regulations on safety, appropriate dress and behavior during club events.  Attire  The chef‚Äôs costume, the jacket and hat, or ‚Äútoque‚Äù, are steeped in history and tradition which members honor by dressing appropriately for each regular event and by wearing a Les Marmitons jacket and hat. Members are also required to bring their chef and paring knives to each cooking event. At the Annual Meeting and other special events, members are required to wear the club jacket, hat and medallion as well as dress pants.  Comportement  The French word ‚Äúcomportement‚Äù, referring to one‚Äôs manner or bearing, has special meaning at Les Marmitons. Members share a common desire to cultivate and enjoy the gastronomic and social aspects of the club - and excessive consumption as well as the conducting of commercial business is deemed inappropriate at club events.  Chapter locations  Chapters are located in Halifax lesmarmitonshalifax.ca Montreal, Ottawa-Gatineau, Toronto, New Jersey (Woodbridge), Quebec City, Atlanta, Calgary, Longueuil, Canton (GA), Sandy Springs (GA), Cranford (NJ), Barrie, Niagara-on-the-Lake, Winnipeg, Canton (GA), Keowee (SC) and London (ON) and Waterloo Region (ON).

J. Cronin which traces the formative years of an Irish orphan, Robert Shannon, who is sent to live with his draconian maternal grandparents in Scotland. An introspective child, Robert forms an attachment to his roguish great-grandfather, who draws the youngster out of his shell with his raucous ways. The Green Years dominated The New York Times Fiction Best Sellers of 1945 for 17 weeks.John Bear, The #1 New York Times Best Seller: intriguing facts about the 484 books that have been #1 New York Times bestsellers since the first list, 50 years ago, Berkeley: Ten Speed Press, 1992. pp. 17-21 Significance of title The title, The Green Years, has several connotations. On one hand, this is a story about a boy's coming of age. However, the central character, Robert Shannon, also has a fascination with the natural world. Additionally, he is a Catholic growing up with his Presbyterian relatives. In the novel, he is forced for a time to wear a ridiculous green suit made for him by his Grandma, and is mercilessly teased at school because of it.. Structure The novel consists of three sections: Book One portrays the protagonist's arrival in Scotland as a child, following the death of his parents back in Ireland; Book Two focuses on the character's adolescence and ends on a pair of tragedies (the death of his best friend and his failure to win a scholarship to study medicine at the university, due to a sudden illness); Book Three begins with the protagonist as a somewhat embittered figure, entering the adult working world with little hope for the future, which is only compounded by the fact that he has fallen in love. He yearns for a career in the sciences, but is thwarted by a lack of financial resources. However, the death of his beloved great grandfather brings him an inheritance that will enable him to pursue his dreams after all. Filmed The Green Years was released in 1946 and it was a popular film.\\"Charles Coburn Has Prize Role in 'The Green Years'\\" (The Pittsburgh Press, July 1, 1945, Page 25) The film was directed by Victor Saville and the cast featured Charles Coburn, Tom Drake, Beverly Tyler, Hume Cronyn, Gladys Cooper, Dean Stockwell, Selena Royle, and Jessica Tandy.

The television show was presented by Paddy O'Connell & Libby Potter. Later, the comedian Jenny Eclair was the presenter. Players were given the opportunity to buy and sell shares in celebrities using ¬£10,000 of virtual cash. As in real- life stock markets, the trading of shares caused each celebrity's share price to fluctuate, allowing profits to be realised. Weekly dividends were paid on shares owned based upon how much press coverage the celebrity received in a number of daily newspapers and magazines. There was also a version specifically concentrating on sportspeople, called Sportdaq. History Celebdaq was launched on the BBC website in mid-2002. It was based on other very similar games, Popex.com which had been \\"trading\\" in musicians since 1998, and Hollywood Stock Exchange. The Celebdaq code was a port of the popex code, with some additions. The website consciously imitated the financial setting of the Stock Exchange with share prices fluctuating continuously around the clock. After a slow start and a number of rule changes to prevent cheating, the game rapidly gained popularity and a weekly prize for \\"Top Trader\\" was instigated consisting of ¬£100 in cash along with a stripy jacket replicating those worn by traders on the floor of the stock exchange. The prize was later changed to a selection of merchandise. The site was used to promote the new BBC Three digital channel which opened the following year, and Patrick (Paddy) O'Connell, a former business correspondent and real-life stock exchange expert, was engaged as presenter of the tie-in BBC Three TV shows which were broadcast from 14 February 2003 to 18 March 2004. In 2004 Celebdaq was chosen as the best entertainment site on the internet at the Interactive Bafta awards. Until 2005 the BBC also provided online message boards for traders to discuss strategy and post tips for the coming week. Following an incident in which a footballer who had taken out an injunction preventing publication of a story was named on the site, the BBC tightened editorial controls and shortly afterwards the official Celebdaq message boards were scrapped altogether. Several MSN Groups were formed, where experienced players and former top traders posted their weekly tips thread, but these ended along with MSN Groups in 2009. On 7 January 2010 the BBC announced the creation of a new Celebdaq game. The two games ran in tandem, with the new game created by Monterosa, running in beta. Although it was possible to upgrade an account, it was not possible to carry on trading shares that were already owned. =Site closure= Celebdaq and its sister website Sportdaq were both closed on Friday 26 February 2010 as part of a series of cuts to the BBC's online services.https://www.bbc.co.uk/celebdaq/closed.shtmlCELEBDAQ AND SPORTDAQ ARE NOW CLOSED The BBC stated that its online operation needed a \\"new, harder focus on quality and distinctiveness\\".https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/mar/02/bbc-websites- axed (The Guardian) BBC to shut string of websites =Relaunch 2019= Celebdaq was reestablished and relaunched by a fan of the original game at the end of December 2018 under its own website (http://www.celebdaq.co.uk). Traders can buy and sell stock (shares) in the celebs listed and receive dividends and increases to their portfolio value based on the stocks performance. This latest incarnation is far more dynamic than the original and share prices change daily through media exposure. Additional features such as stock having a \\"life span\\" after which it becomes worthless are also present as well as the ability to purchase \\"trophies\\" to showcase your financial status in the game. Weekly events =Millionaire Day= Everyone who had a portfolio worth over a million pounds was \\"kneecapped\\". In the early hours of Monday morning, traders who were worth over a million pounds had their portfolio emptied, and exchanged for a status symbol, depending on how much they had. See Kneecapping and Status Symbols. Traders who had their portfolio emptied were given ¬£10,000 to keep on playing. =Top Trader= For a time the person who made the most profit in percentage terms during the previous 7 days won Celebdaq merchandise. The winner has often made 20+ fold increase. After 1 August 2007 the \\"Top Trader\\" competition was suspended. =Diary Day= A list of upcoming celebrity events during the following week was put on the website. This was used as a guide to who is likely to get dividends. =Dividend Friday= The dividends accumulated during the last 7 days were handed out. The dividend received depended on how long the owner had the share. Only shares that were owned from Monday till Friday receive the full dividend.

He is deemed to be a prominent tulku (reincarnate lama) in the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism, the ninth reincarnation in his particular line. His full name and title is the Very Venerable Ninth Khenchen Thrangu Tulku, Karma Lodr√∂ Lungrik Maway Senge. \\"Khenchen\\" denotes great scholarly accomplishment, and the term \\"Rinpoche\\" is an honorific title commonly afforded to Tibetan lamas. Biography =Early life and exile= Thrangu Rinpoche was installed at Thrangu Monastery in Kham (eastern Tibet) after his identification by the Sixteenth Karmapa and the previous Tai Situpa at age five. He is one of the principal lamas there, although Traleg Rinpoche is the supreme abbot of the complex. He fled to India following the Chinese invasion in 1959. At the age of thirty-five Thrangu Rinpoche took the geshe examination in Bengal and was awarded the degree of Geshe Lharampa, the highest degree conferred in the Gelug transmission (it is not uncommon for monks of other lineage to pursue studies in that tradition). He was subsequently awarded the Khenchen degree of the Kagyu tradition. He played a critical role in the recovery of important Buddhist texts that had been largely destroyed by the Chinese Communists. He was named Abbot of Rumtek monastery, the home monastery in exile of the Karmapa, and also of the Nalanda Institute for Higher Buddhist Studies at Rumtek. =Establishment of Buddhist institutions= As Abbot of the Nalanda Institute, Thrangu Rinpoche and Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche trained all the younger tulkus of the lineage, including the Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche, who was in the first class. He was also the personal tutor of the four principal Karma Kagyu tulkus: Shamar Rinpoche, Tai Situ Rinpoche, Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche, and Gyaltsab Rinpoche. Thrangu Rinpoche established the fundamental curriculum of the Karma Kagyu lineage taught at Rumtek. In addition, he taught with Khenpo Karthar Rinpoche, who had been a teacher at Thrangu Rinpoche's monastery in Tibet before 1959, and who is now head of Karma Triyana Dharmachakra in Woodstock, New York, the seat of Karmapa in North America. In 1976, after 15 years at Rumtek, Thrangu Rinpoche founded the Thrangu Tashi Choling monastery in Boudhanath, Kathmandu, Nepal, and later also founded a retreat centre and college at Namo Buddha; Tara Abbey, which offers a full dharma education for Tibetan nuns leading to a khenpo degree; a school in Boudhanath for the general education of Tibetan children and young monks in Western subjects and Buddhist studies; and a free medical clinic in an impoverished area of Nepal. Thrangu Rinpoche recently completed a large monastery in Sarnath, India, overlooking the deer park where the Buddha gave his first teaching on the Four Noble Truths. The monastery is named Vajra Vidya in honor of the Sixteenth Karmapa. It is now the seat of the major annual Kagyu conference. =Worldwide activities= In 1976, Thrangu Rinpoche began teaching Buddhism throughout Asia and in the West. He founded Thrangu House in Oxford, England, in 1981, then in the United States and Canada, he established centres in Crestone, Colorado, Maine, California, Vancouver and Edmonton. He has another fourteen centres in nine other countries. He is the Abbot of Gampo Abbey, a Karma Kagyu monastery in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, founded by his dharma brother Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche, reflective of his close ties the Shambhala Buddhist community. Rinpoche currently resides in Nepal where he serves as senior tutor to Urgyen Trinley Dorje. On 25 July 2010, Thrangu Monastery was opened by Thrangu Rinpoche in Richmond, British Columbia, Canada. It is the first traditional Buddhist monastery in Canada. It contains a gold-plated statue of Shakyamuni Buddha, and the shrine hall can seat 500 people\\"Canada's first traditional Tibetan Buddhist monastery opens.\\" By Andrea Woo, Vancouver Sun July 23, 2010.

It was directed by the actor Robert Montgomery from a screenplay by Ben Hecht and Charles Lederer, which was based on the 1946 novel of the same name by Dorothy B. Hughes. The drama also features Montgomery as the main character. Thomas Gomez was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance. An army veteran known only as Gagin travels to San Pablo, a rural New Mexican town, to avenge the death of his old war time buddy. As a man devoid of identity, some of the villagers refer to Gagin as \\"the man with no place.\\" A common theme in noir films is the post-war disillusionment experienced by many soldiers returning to a peacetime economy, which was mirrored in the sordidness of the urban crime film. In these films a serviceman returns to find his sweetheart unfaithful or a good friend dead. The war continues, but now the antagonism turns with a new viciousness toward American society itself. In Ride the Pink Horse, Gagin's quest to avenge his friend's death leads him to a small village in rural New Mexico, an unusual setting for the noir motif more typically associated with corrupt urban environments.Cobb, Sean . Film Noir: The Trouble with Genre, University of Arizona, 2005. Last accessed: December 7, 2007. Plot Lucky Gagin (Robert Montgomery) arrives on a bus in San Pablo, a small rural town in New Mexico, during its annual fiesta. He plans to confront and blackmail a mobster named Frank Hugo (Fred Clark) as retribution for the death of his best friend Shorty. He unpacks a Colt .45 pistol from his luggage, sticks it in his waistband, places a check which incriminates Hugo in locker 250, and hides the locker key behind a framed map in the bus depot waiting room using a piece of chewing gum. Because of the fiesta, Gagin cannot find a room at the hotel by the bus station. He is directed to the non-tourist side of the town. At the merry-go-round there, he meets Pila (Wanda Hendrix), who takes him to the La Fonda Hotel and gives him a \\"charm of Ishtam\\" that she says will protect him. At the hotel, Gagin uses a ruse to find out that Frank Hugo is in room 315. Gagin comes, uninvited, into the hotel room, and proceeds to knock out Jonathan (Richard Gaines), Hugo's private secretary. Marjorie Lundeen (Andrea King), a sophisticated female acquaintance of Hugo's, comes in and uses her wiles trying to learn more about him. When the telephone rings, Gagin answers and impersonates a bell boy. Speaking with Hugo, he learns that Hugo will not be there that day. Gagin leaves the room and in the hotel lobby, he is accosted by FBI agent Bill Retz (Art Smith). In his conversation with Gagin, Retz recounts the plot so far. Retz takes Gagin to lunch and tells Gagin to lay off with his plot for revenge on Frank Hugo. Still looking for a room, Gagin ends up at the Cantina de las Tres Violetas, where Pila is inexplicably sitting outside. Going inside, Gagin finds himself to be the only non-Hispanic in the bar. He buys himself a large whiskey and pays for it with a twenty- dollar bill. The barkeep can only make change for ten dollars and the situation is resolved by Pancho (Thomas Gomez), who proposes that Gagin buy ten dollars' worth of drinks for everyone in the bar. Gagin, having spent twenty dollars at the bar, accompanies Pancho back to his tiovivo (carousel) where Pancho puts him up for the night. Pila arrives at the merry-go-round and ends up sleeping in one of the seats on the carousel. Retz also shows up and warns Gagin of the toughs and tells him that if he could readily find Gagin, so will the toughs. The next morning, Gagin goes back to the hotel where he meets Frank Hugo, who wears a hearing aid. Gagin tells Hugo that he has check number 6431 and proceeds to lay out the blackmail. They agree to meet that evening at the Tip Top Cafe, where Hugo will pay Gagin the thirty thousand dollars for the incriminating check. Retz meets Gagin and \\"officially\\" asks for the evidence, which Gagin refuses to hand over. Gagin takes Pila to lunch and they are interrupted by the arrival of Marjorie Lundeen. She lays out a scheme for how to shake down Frank Hugo for even more money, but Gagin does not go along with Marjorie's plan. After the lunch, Gagin returns to the bus depot where he retrieves the check and follows the fiesta crowd to the Tip Top Cafe. He meets with Hugo, who is having dinner with his associates. Hugo tells Gagin that the bank messenger with the money will be late. Marjorie invites Gagin to dance with her, and in order to not be seen by Hugo, she walks Gagin outside to a dark alley. There, she tells him that there is no messenger, but someone else. The response to Gagin's query as to who is coming is two toughs who jump him. In the ensuing fight, one of them stabs Gagin in the right shoulder with a knife. Retz finds the two toughs in the alley, one dead and one with a broken arm, and confronts Hugo at the dining table. While the police search the area, Pila finds Gagin in the bushes, pulls the knife out of his back, and together they make their way back to Pancho and the merry-go- round. Two toughs come to the tiovivo. With Gagin hidden in one of the seats by Pila, and children riding the carousel, the toughs proceed to severely beat Pancho, who does not divulge the presence of Gagin. Gagin, whose health and mental state are failing, agrees to go with Pila back by bus to her village of San Melo. While they are waiting in the Tres Violetas, Gagin gives the check to Pila, who hides it in her bustier. They are found by Locke (Edward Earle) and Lundeen. When Locke approaches the now passed out Gagin, Pila hits him with a bottle and they make their escape, leaving Marjorie to find Locke lying on the floor the cantina. Gagin makes his way back to the La Fonda Hotel, where Pila finds him outside room 315. The door is opened by one of Hugo's toughs and the duo is brought into the room, where Frank Hugo, Marjorie Lundeen, Jonathan, and the two toughs are present. Hugo begins to question the now incoherent Gagin, who does not remember where the check is. He is beaten by one of the toughs, who then proceed to also beat Pila. Retz arrives, disarms the toughs, breaks Hugo's hearing aid, and ultimately gets the check from Gagin. At a two-dollar breakfast the next day with Retz, Gagin refuses to eat. Retz tells Gagin that he should say goodbye to Pila and Pancho, and together they return to the merry go round. Gagin bids adieu to Pancho, and then, uncomfortably, to Pila, to whom he returns the Ishtam charm. As Retz and Gagin leave, Pila, who had been somewhat of an outcast with her peers, is surrounded by them. She recounts the story of her adventure and realizes that now she is the center of attention among her group.

It was purchased by the producers and shipped to the set of Universal where it was reconstructed for use in the film.Silver, Alain, and Elizabeth Ward, eds. Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style, 3rd edition (Woodstock, New York: The Overlook Press, 1992), , 242 The burning of the Zozobra (\\"Old Man Gloom\\") effigy during the Fiestas de Santa Fe sets the time of the events in the film in early September. Part of the movie was filmed at the La Fonda Hotel in Santa Fe.  Novel  Dorothy B. Hughes, a famous crime writer in the mid-twentieth century, wrote Ride the Pink Horse in 1946. The novel would later become one of her most popular published pieces, alongside the novels In a Lonely Place and The Expendable Man among many others. Her works are renowned for their ability to capture the feelings of loneliness and darkness; they also showcase Hughes‚Äô ability to add suspense while maintaining pacing throughout her stories. The novel Ride the Pink Horse was written in the noir fiction style. It had many dark and mysterious characteristics. Hughes‚Äô writing style emanated throughout the novel demonstrated by the sense of urgency and suspense that held steady over the entire course of the story. The story illustrated the efforts of Sailor confronting Douglass, a wealthy ex-senator, about the murder of the senator's wife. Sailor, growing up under Douglass‚Äô wing, became a henchman of sorts, who often carried out Douglass‚Äô dirty work. Sailor knew that it was the senator that ordered for his wife's murder, and since the death of the senator's wife, Douglass continuously paid of Sailor in order to keep him quiet, but now, Sailor is back for more money. Douglass, who after retiring from the senate, is vacationing in Santa Fe, New Mexico, so Sailor decides to confront him there. Upon his arrival, he finds that there is a fiesta in town and with the all the commotion, Sailor does not have a place to stay overnight. He is also greeted by the head of the homicide bureau in Chicago, McIntyre, who knows a lot about Douglass and his dirty past. Along his adventure, Sailor befriends a few locals, a man named Pancho and a young 14-year-old girl, who help him through his journey. This film adaptation was released a year after the novel's publication, on October 8, 1947, with slight changes to the characters. In the novel, a character named \\"Sailor\\" rather than Frank Hugo has managed to obtain a deferment from military service. The film makes many details, including those of the blackmail scheme, less sordid, and adopts different names and occupations for the principal non-Mexican characters. Although Gagin's first name is never mentioned in the film, the opening credits read: Robert Montgomery is Lucky Gagin. The character Frank Hugo, as portrayed by Fred Clark, has more than a passing resemblance to Zozobra, the god of bad luck, whose effigy is burned as part of the fiesta. Ride the Pink Horse would become Hughes‚Äô second film, but her first based on her own story. = Other adaptations = *A 1947 Lux Radio Theater adaptation with Montgomery and Hendrix can be heard at the Internet Archive. *In 1950 the story was adapted using the same title for Robert Montgomery Presents TV series. *The film was remade as the 1964 TV movie The Hanged Man, directed by Don Siegel.

Johnson concurrently served as Director of the Ohio Department of Development. Johnson's rise in Ohio was swift. He entered politics in Columbus, becoming Greg Lashutka's chief of staff after he managed Lashutka's successful 1991 campaign for mayor of Columbus. Johnson left that post when he was appointed to the Ohio Senate in 1994. After being elected to two terms and rising to the second highest post in the Senate, Governor Bob Taft in 2001 asked Johnson to join his cabinet as Director of the Ohio Department of Development. In 2005, Taft appointed him lieutenant governor. Johnson in December 2006 resigned a month before his term ended. Background Johnson graduated from Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio, with a bachelor of arts degree in economics before attending law school at Capital University in Columbus, where he received his Juris Doctor degree in 1985. While at Bowling Green he became a member of Delta Tau Delta International Fraternity.The Rainbow, vol. 132, no. 2, p. 10, He was admitted to the Ohio bar on November 4, 1985. After a year as an assistant city prosecutor in Columbus, he joined the firm of Chester, Willcox, and Saxbe in Columbus, working there from until 2001. In 1991, Johnson was the campaign manager for Greg Lashutka's successful mayoral run in Columbus and became his chief of staff when Lashutka was sworn in. Johnson served in City Hall from 1992 to 1994, where he was responsible for supervising ten department directors. He helped abolish the city's Human Services Department and reorganize the city's operations. Upon his resignation to enter the Ohio Senate, The Columbus Dispatch said Johnson: He is presently a resident of the Columbus suburb of Westerville. He and his wife, Kelley, have four children: Shane (born circa 1988), Meagan (born circa 1989), Connor (born circa 1993), and Morgan Christine (born 1995). Enters the Ohio Senate Johnson was appointed by the Senate Republican caucus to the Third District Ohio Senate seat in the 120th General Assembly effective March 1, 1994, replacing Theodore W. Gray, a Republican of Upper Arlington, who resigned after forty-three years in the Senate. The seat represented the eastern third of Franklin County, the suburbs of Columbus, the state capital. The district included all of the municipalities of Bexley, Canal Winchester, Obetz, New Albany, Whitehall, Gahanna, Reynoldsburg and Westerville, part of Worthington and a sliver of the northern edge of the county. Johnson took the oath from Ohio Chief Justice Thomas J. Moyer. Johnson ran for a full term that year and was unopposed in the May 3 primary, after Linda S. Reidelbach, an unsuccessful independent candidate for Congress in the 15th District in 1992 who also failed to win appointment to Gray's seat, withdrew from the race despite filing nominating petitions. Johnson received 15,271 votes in the primary. On November 8, he faced Democratic nominee Christina L. Cox, a 38-year-old township trustee in Blendon Township. Cox had also been unopposed in her primary. Cox filed a complaint with the Ohio Elections Commission because Johnson ran television advertisements calling for voters to \\"re-elect\\" him. \\"A key issue in this campaign is the fact that Bruce Johnson has never been elected to anything,\\" Cox told The Columbus Dispatch. \\"He was appointed by the Downtown influence peddlers, but he's trying to make the people think they elected him.\\" Johnson won the endorsement of The Columbus Dispatch, which described him as \\"a longtime political activist within the Republican Party\\" with \\"a firm grasp of legal, tax and job-development issues.\\" Johnson won the general election, 53,290 (61.78%) to 38,974 (38.22%). =First term work= Johnson in 1995 called for reform of tax incentives and financing for corporations, saying it was political and unfair. \\"Why do we want to subsidize one competitor over another?\\" he asked ... \\"I believe the market should dictate where the jobs will be,\\" he told The Columbus Dispatch. He sponsored legislation that would limit prisoners given a sentence of death to a single appeal and to speed up the appellate process by eliminating review by the district courts of appeal. (The latter was authorized by a constitutional amendment approved by voters in 1994.) The legislation passed the Senate and House easily and was signed by Governor George V. Voinovich. Johnson in 1996 chaired a special committee examining tort reform. The resulting bill, which passed the Senate, would, in the words of The Columbus Dispatch, \\"cap noneconomic and punitive damages, impose additional time limits for filing lawsuits and protect defendants in multidefendant cases from being liable for unpaid portions of a judgment.\\" The minority party was unhappy, the paper reported, \\"Democrats blasted Republicans, saying they were catering to business at the expense of the victims of their negligence.\\" Senator Jeffrey D. Johnson, a Cleveland Democrat, said \\"Somewhere along the way we have shifted away from concern for the victim to concern for business,\\" but Johnson defended the legislation. \\"What we've done is tried to strike a balance. Lawsuit abuse threatens to close the doors of many small businesses in our state.\\" To make it easier for cities to take property owners to court for violations of zoning and building codes, Johnson in 1997 introduced legislation to let zoning officers issue tickets similar to traffic tickets from the police. \\"We need to protect neighborhoods against landlords and people who don't keep up their property,\\" he told The Columbus Dispatch. The City of Columbus had requested help because it claimed the existing process of going to criminal court was too slow. In the 1996 presidential primaries, Johnson supported former Tennessee governor Lamar Alexander. In the Senate Johnson became chairman of the Judiciary Committee in July 1995 after only sixteen months in the chamber when the committee's chairman, Senator Barry Levey, a Republican of Middletown, retired. Johnson was the youngest-ever chairman of the Judiciary Committee. In the 122nd General Assembly (the 1997‚Äì1998 session), he chose to retain that post after dropping out of the race for majority whip, the fourth ranking post in the Republican leadership. He also was chairman of the Ways and Means Committee before entering the Senate leadership in 1999 and had been a member of the Legislative Ethics Committee. Runs in Columbus Johnson in 1997 sought election to a four-year term as Columbus city attorney, who prosecutes misdemeanors within the city limits, defends the city in civil cases, and acts as the city's chief legal advisor with a budget of about $7 million with 140 employees. Johnson was endorsed by the Franklin County Republican Party and, as no other Republican filed, did not face a primary election. \\"Of all the jobs that are out there, that's the one I'm most qualified for right now,\\" he told The Columbus Dispatch in January. He faced Janet E. Jackson, a former municipal court judge appointed by the city council that month to complete the term of Ron O'Brien, who had been elected Franklin County Prosecuting Attorney. Johnson ran what The Dispatch characterized as an \\"aggressive\\" campaign on television and in debates. Among Johnson's concerns was that Jackson had been settling civil suits against the city too readily and for too much money and that she had been lax in prosecuting parents who failed to make child support payments. \\"I would be a deadbeat parent's worst nightmare,\\" Johnson bragged. However, Jackson noted that no child support cases had been filed with her office and she could not be blamed for failing to hold parents accountable. The Dispatch described one ad: \\"a man is shown attacking a woman in a kitchen as an announcer cites domestic violence statistics from Jackson's office\\" that she had dismissed or plea bargained 96 per cent of domestic violence cases. Jackson said of the commercial \\"It's base,\\" she said. \\"It was meant to elicit a reaction,\\" but Johnson countered \\"What she's afraid about is that people will find out that an outrageous number of domestic violence cases are dismissed or plea bargained. The outrage is the facts, not me bringing them up.\\" The Dispatch called Johnson a \\"worthy opponent\\" to Jackson, but endorsed her, citing her experience and her \\"commitment to professionalism and nonpartisanship.\\" Despite spending $265,900 on his campaign, Johnson lost the November 4 election, winning 41 per cent to Jackson's 59 per cent. Jackson was disappointed with her opponent, telling The Dispatch after her victory \\"the senator and I talked early about running positive campaigns. Unfortunately, his campaign ended up being about half-truths and half-statements.\\" Continues Senate service The Ohio Statehouse in Columbus where the Ohio Senate meets.In 1998, he sought re-election to his Senate seat. He was again unopposed in the Republican primary, held on May 5, in which he received 20,130 votes. The Columbus Dispatch endorsed him in the fall, editorializing: :During the past four years, no senator was more active or as deeply involved in as many major issues as Johnson . . . . A legislative whirlwind, he personally sponsored numerous bills and shepherded others into law. . . . By any measure, this legislative record is substantive and valuable to central Ohio and the state. . . . Johnson is respected and trusted on both sides of the aisle. His accomplishments are remarkable for someone just 38 years old. He fully deserves another term. In the general election on November 3, he faced Democrat Debra A. Payne, a small businesswoman who owned a data- processing firm and was a three-term councilwoman in Gahanna. Payne told The Columbus Dispatch \\"I went door to door and asked, 'Do you know who your state senator is?' They said, 'I have no idea,' and I said, 'That's why you need me.' \\" Johnson defeated her by a vote of 53,074 (54.79%) to 43,796 (45.21%), a decreased margin of seven percent from 1994. After his reelection, the Senate Republican caucus elected him assistant president pro tempore, the third ranking post in the GOP leadership, defeating fellow a Franklin County senator, Eugene Watts of Dublin, who sought another term in that post. In December 1998, Columbus Mayor Greg Latshukta announced he would not seek a third term in 1999. Johnson briefly considered a run for the seat, but decided against it. The same month, Johnson told The Columbus Dispatch he was investigating overturning the city council's vote to grant benefits to domestic partners of city employers, according them the same treatment as spouses. Johnson objected to the idea itself, the cost, and the manner in which the question was rushed through the council without any public notice or debate. \\"No matter what you think of the merits, the process on an issue they knew could raise serious questions from the public was circumvented,\\" said Johnson. =Concerned with protecting children= Johnson was strongly anti- abortion. In 2000, he sponsored legislation allowing mothers to leave a newborn baby at a hospital, police station, and like public facilities without fear of criminal charges. \\"I believe this bill is pro-life because it protects the life of a child regardless of the actions of its parents. I only wish we could protect babies earlier,\\" he told The Plain Dealer. In 2000, Johnson sponsored legislation that would require background checks for volunteers working in private groups, claiming \\"This turns the spotlight on the leeches of our society who are preying on our children.\\" The proposal met stiff opposition, being labeled an \\"inquisition\\" by The Toledo Blade and was denounced by The Plain Dealer \\"as a tool for harassment, and would be a disincentive to thousands of civic-minded, morally upright Ohioans who volunteer to work with children.\\" \\"This bill can impose a life sentence prohibiting service to the youth of our community resulting from discovery of a listed felony conviction at any time in a person's life,\\" Christine Nardecchia, president of the Volunteer Administrators' Network of Central Ohio, told The Toledo Blade. Johnson was also concerned with children's health, introducing legislation in 2000 to require all children twelve and under to be vaccinated against chicken pox. Johnson sponsored legislation to allow mothers to breast feed their children in public. =Utility deregulation spearheaded= Electricity deregulation legislation occupied the General Assembly from 1997 to 1999. In early 1997 Johnson and Representative Priscilla D. Mead, a Republican from Upper Arlington, were named co-chairmen of the General Assembly's Joint Committee on Electric Utility Deregulation. Johnson was the chief sponsor of the proposal and worked hard to shepherd it through the legislature. The plan faced an uphill fight against the utility industry and advocates for consumers. \\"The proposed legislation provides utilities adequate revenue to make the transition to a competitive market. It will not result in any consumers' paying more for electricity,\\" he promised his colleagues in the General Assembly, worried about increasing their constituents' bills. Johnson called his plan \\"a reasonable and fair approach\\" and ultimately prevailing, Johnson successfully passing the legislation into law in 1999. =Sealing Senate records= Johnson was strongly criticized for his 2001 attempt to repeal the reach of Ohio's sunshine law that made state records available to the public, a proposal contained in the massive state budget bill. Darrell Rowland of The Columbus Dispatch described Johnson's idea: \\"The obscure proposal‚Äìtwo dozen lines in a 58,936-line bill‚Äìwould prevent subpoenas of legislative staff members and their communications with legislators. The bill also would keep secret any legislative documents not deemed public records‚Äìa broad category because the General Assembly already concealed much of that material from public view two years ago.\\" William L. Phillis, executive director of the Coalition for Equity and Adequacy, a group of public schools suing the State of Ohio for more funding, told the newspaper \\"This is not something you expect in a democracy. You might expect this kind of behavior from a third-world dictator, one that would want to hide wrongdoing by making a decree that makes it right.\\" Johnson told The Dispatch \\"I need unlimited, unfettered discretion to seek every fact I can find in order to come to a decent conclusion. What we want to do is make sure the senators and representatives are competently representing the will of the people.\\" The senator also claimed seventeenth-century English common law justified his plan. Thomas C. Drabick Jr. of Blacklick said in a letter to the editor published in The Dispatch \\"He has unlimited and unfettered arrogance. Who does he think he works for? Clearly, he does not believe that he is responsible to the people of Ohio; otherwise, he would not seek to keep secrets from us.\\" The Dispatch agreed, editorializing that \\"Government decisions made in secret aren't necessarily better decisions, they're just secret decisions. Unfortunately, too many of Ohio's legislative leaders seem sold on the idea that keeping things hush-hush is good.\\" Nevertheless, the Senate passed Johnson's proposal, part of the state budget, over attempts by the Democratic minority to remove the language from the bill. =Other legislative work= Johnson was a critic of the United States Congress's efforts to force states, under penalty of losing federal highway money, to lower the blood alcohol level considered driving under the influence. Johnson suggested that at the new lower limit, \\"We could give that level a $100 fine, or call it driving under federal blackmail.\\" He also sponsored legislation to increase the hours of driving sixteen-year-olds needed to obtain a driver's license and saw it enacted into law. Johnson opposed efforts to locate state offices outside of Columbus, defeating a bill in committee in 1998. Johnson declared of the defeat \\"the people of the state are the winners, not Toledo, not Marietta, not Columbus.\\" In 1999, he obtained Senate passage of a resolution commending \\"Neighbors Day\\". As part of the debate, he sang the theme song to Mister Rogers' Neighborhood on the Senate floor. That year he also sponsored legislation to declare the northern largemouth bass the official state fish. The Columbus Dispatch after his resignation referred to his \\"blunt, opinionated style.\\" Johnson also served as President Pro Tempore of the Senate, the second ranking position in the body, which he held when he left to enter Governor Taft's cabinet. He was chairman of the Finance and Financial Institutions Committee until his resignation. Appointed Development Director On August 28, 2001, Johnson being ineligible for a third term under Ohio's term limits law, Governor Taft appointed him director of the Ohio Department of Development to replace C. Lee Johnson, who had resigned the previous December. \\"His experience as a capable manager and knowledge of utility issues, tax policies, economic development, and the law make him an excellent choice\\" said Taft. The department, with a staff of five hundred and a half-billion dollar budget, is charged with promoting economic development in Ohio, attracting new industry, and promoting tourism in the state. Johnson resigned from his Senate seat on September 17 and David Goodman, a 34-year-old member of the Ohio House, was appointed by the Senate Republican caucus in Johnson's place. Upon his departure, Johnson told his colleagues \\"I hope to make you proud, and I hope to pick your pocket.\\" Johnson's hometown paper, The Columbus Dispatch, hailed the choice saying \\"Taft picked a pro in Bruce E. Johnson\\" but Cleveland's The Plain Dealer, Ohio's largest newspaper, editorialized that Johnson was an \\"uninspired choice\\" with \\"no discernible experience in job creation.\\" The Toledo Blade also was skeptical, writing in an editorial \\"he brings gusto to a job that requires verve, imagination, and the ability to turn visions into reality. He has the first. For the rest we must wait and see.\\" The Blade also criticized Johnson's efforts to keep state offices in Columbus and opposed his ideas for spending state development funds: \\"Mr. Johnson's plan to target technology and biotechnology jobs suggests the same old advantage will go to the cities that get them now: Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati\\" at the expense of other neglected areas of the state. The Columbus Dispatch wrote Johnson \\"would seem to have little to commend him for the job, except perhaps for his degree in economics from Bowling Green State University,\\" but he told the paper \\"I have the confidence of the governor.\\" Almost immediately there was speculation of his being promoted to the post of lieutenant governor. In November 2001, the Dayton Daily News reported there were rumors Governor Taft would name Johnson his running mate to replace Maureen O'Connor as lieutenant governor, who had announced she would run for the Ohio Supreme Court in 2002. Taft, however, chose Jennette Bradley, a councilwoman from Columbus. Johnson led the campaign advocating the Third Frontier program, a large state bond issue to finance industrial research and development, which Governor Taft had championed. Critics such as Representative Tom Brinkman, a Republican of Cincinnati, called it \\"corporate welfare\\". Johnson after its defeat by the voters in November 2003 told The Plain Dealer the plan was not dead. \\"There will definitely be continuing efforts to fund this strategy, because it‚Äôs the right strategy. So you don‚Äôt drop it. You continue to encourage state funding. But it‚Äôs certainly more challenging,\\" he said, after the failure.\\" Johnson turned out to be right. In 2005, Johnson was the point man on the Third Frontier campaign again, but this time voters in Ohio approved State Issue One which allocated dollars to support technology and innovation. Johnson served as the Chairman of the Third Frontier Commission. In May, 2010 the voters renewed the Third Frontier once again. As director of the Department of Development, Johnson was frequently in attendance at announcements of factory openings and expansions and was often quoted in Ohio newspapers in connection with any new employment in the state. As lieutenant governor =Job swaps bring Johnson to office= Johnson became lieutenant governor through a series of job swaps in the Republican Party, routine in the party. Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney Michael K. Allen withdrew his name as a candidate for reelection after a sex scandal. Allen's predecessor, Ohio State Treasurer Joseph T. Deters, agreed to run as a write in candidate for his old job as scandal clouded Deters's prospects‚Äìtwo of his aides had been indicted. When Deters was elected, he resigned as treasurer and Governor Bob Taft then appointed Lieutenant Governor Jennette B. Bradley to Deters's post. Taft announced he would appoint Johnson to Bradley's former post on December 21, 2004, and that Johnson would continue to serve as head of the Department of Development. (Johnson announced he would not take the lieutenant governor's salary, which was about half the Development director's pay of $125,000 per annum.) The Akron Beacon-Journal declared \\"the lieutenant governor's role in Columbus is typically about as exciting as drywall,\\" as the lieutenant governor's job carries no duties except what the Governor assigns, the chief function of the office now being to provide a successor to the Governor. The Cincinnati Enquirer, a Republican paper, editorialized \\"Johnson and Bradley seem to be good choices for these jobs. However, the way they got the posts points out again that Ohio is clearly dominated by one political party, a situation we do not think is healthy for the state, no matter which party is in control.\\" When Johnson's name came before the Republican controlled General Assembly on January 4, 2005, the day after Bradley's resignation, it was the first time a governor had appointed a new lieutenant governor and consequently the legislature had no experience with such a nomination. The nomination was swiftly approved over the objections of the Democratic minority, who protested there was not sufficient opportunity to debate the question. Senator Eric Fingerhut, a Democrat from Cleveland, noted \\"He's a heartbeat away, a peanut away from being the governor of the state of Ohio. No, he was not elected by the people.\\" Senate Democratic leader C. J. Prentiss of Cleveland was quoted by The Columbus Dispatch on January 5: \\"In essence, voters are being denied their franchise of public participation and are not having a voice in this process. This is the severity of what can happen with one-party rule, and we want to protect their interest by objecting to this charade of an unelected public official.\\" \\"We need to have a discussion and not just appoint him in ten minutes or less,\\" said Senator Dan Brady, a Democrat from Cleveland. Brady said on the Senate floor \\"The majority party is playing musical chairs with statewide offices in this state. We have to have some type of process.\\" The Beacon-Journal was also skeptical of \\"the latest round of musical chairs among Republican officeholders in Columbus.\\" Nevertheless, the General Assembly passed House Joint Resolution 1, which confirmed Johnson, on January 4, 2005, by 97‚Äì0 in the House and 22-11 in the Senate. Taft told the crowd at the swearing on January 5, \\"Bruce has been actively engaged in designing our program for jobs creation, tax reform and economic development. It is primarily because of his leadership on the economy that I have chosen Bruce.\\" =Work as lieutenant governor= Johnson actively campaigned for the tax reform plans of Governor Taft, which ultimately became law. Johnson told The News Journal in Mansfield that \\"Ohio's outdated tax system hinders our ability to attract new business and employment opportunities in our communities\\" and \\"What we're doing now doesn't make sense. We take the things that business people utilize and give it the highest tax rate in the nation.\\" Michael Douglas, a writer for the Akron Beacon-Journal quoted Johnson's claim that the new business activity tax was \\"one of the most fair and innovative in the nation,\\" but was highly skeptical. Douglas said \\"Ohio [is] fashioning its own version of a tax applied by a mere handful of states. Might Ohioans be concerned that all of this has been championed by a governor and team that botched the mandated reporting of his golf dates?\\" Johnson was head of the committee promoting Taft's $2 billion state bond issue for industrial research and development and road construction on the November 2005 ballot, similar to the failed Third Frontier. Critics of the proposal called the plans \\"pork\\" and \\"corporate welfare\\" but Johnson told The Plain Dealer \\"World-class research creates jobs\\" and \\"We believe this issue will be victorious, mostly because it makes sense to Ohioans to have Ohio spending money to ensure that all the infrastructure in the state is preparing for the jobs of the century.\\" The multibillion-dollar bond issue was passed by voters 1,512,669 (54.12%) to 1,282,571 (45.88%). =Scandal surrounds Taft= In 2005, Governor Bob Taft was convicted of four counts of failing to file accurate financial disclosure statements but said he would not resign his office despite the conviction, which grew out of the Coingate scandal exposed by The Toledo Blade. Johnson, who would become governor if Taft resigned, told The Plain Dealer \\"You don't take this appointment and go through the confirmation process without knowing that you're prepared. But I don't expect it\\" and said he had not spoken to Taft about becoming governor. Johnson was by The Columbus Dispatch that \\"It's not gonna happen. The governor is going to serve out his term. But if something were to happen, I'm prepared to serve as governor.\\" Representative Chris Redfern, a Democrat from Catawba Island and House minority leader, told The Toledo Blade he welcomed Johnson as governor. \\"If Bruce Johnson were to ascend, he could offer real reform.\\" The Dayton Daily News was dismayed with the prospect of Johnson becoming governor. :Bruce Johnson got his job because of another scandal. This gets complicated: former Ohio State Treasurer Joe Deters saw two of his aides indicted. Damaged goods, he left in midterm to run for county prosecutor back home in Cincinnati. Gov. Taft moved then-Lt. Gov. Jennette Bradley into Mr. Deters' job by appointment, hoping she'll hold the spot for Republicans in 2006. And then the governor appointed his development director, Mr. Johnson, as lieutenant governor. The finagling has simply been rampant. For a man to become governor through that process and a gubernatorial scandal would be, uh, scandalous. Whether a new governor with that background would be even weaker than a convicted Gov. Taft is a close call. The decisive factor in determining who should be governor has to be that Gov. Taft was the one who was elected. =Leaving office= Johnson did not file to run for any office in the May 2, 2006, primary. His name was not mentioned in the public speculation as to who the leading Republican candidates for governor, Jim Petro and J. Kenneth Blackwell, might pick as their running mate and was not tapped by either to continue in office. Johnson's term as lieutenant governor would have expired on January 7, 2007, but he announced on December 1, 2006, he would resign on December 8. Governor Bob Taft did not appoint a replacement for the remaining month of the term before Lee Fisher, elected as Ted Strickland's running mate in November, took office. Johnson currently works as the President of the Inter-University Council of Ohio. References #.

The construction of the prison began in the 1780 and it was extended in the style of Pentonville Prison in the 1840 and 1850s. For most of its working life Armagh Gaol was the primary women's prison in Ulster. Although the prison is often described as Armagh Women's Gaol, at various points in its history, various wings in the prison were used to hold male prisoners.Three Gaols: Images of Crumlin Road, Long Kesh and Armagh Prisons; Author: Robert Kerr. Publisher: MSF Press, [2011] During the period of the internment, 33 republican women were interned in the prison from 1973 to 1975. On 19 April 1979, Agnes Wallace (40), a prison officer, was shot dead and three colleagues were injured in an Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) gun and grenade attack outside the prison. The prison was the scene of a protest by female Irish republican prisoners demanding the reinstatement of political status, although the numbers involved were much smaller than in the Maze (also known as Long Kesh) men's prison. As all women prisoners in Northern Ireland already had the right to wear their own clothes, they did not stage any sort of blanket protest, but the no wash protest included the smearing of menstrual blood on the cell walls. Three women in Armagh took part in the 1980 hunger strike: Mair√©ad Nugent, Mary Doyle and Mair√©ad Farrell, who was killed by the Special Air Service (SAS) in Gibraltar in 1988. No Armagh prisoners took part in the 1981 Irish hunger strike. The prison closed in 1986. In 2009 it was announced that the prison was to become a hotel.City gaol to become luxury hotel Armagh Prison was the subject of one of the so-called Black Spider Memos written by Charles, Prince of Wales to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in 2004.https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/427300/NIO_Scanned_Letters.pdf References Further reading *Three Gaols: Images of Crumlin Road, Long Kesh and Armagh Prisons; Author: Robert Kerr.

He was one of the leaders of the Polish, Lithuanian and Belarusian national revival and the leader of the January Uprising in lands of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth.  Life  Konstanty Kalinowski, 1863 A sheet with a fragment of Kalinowski's \\"Letters from under the gallows\\" in Belarusian ≈Åacinka Kastu≈õ Kalino≈≠ski was born to an impoverished szlachta family. His father, Szymon, was a manager of the Masta≈≠liany farm and manor (present-day Belarus). The Kalinowski family hailed from the region of Mazovia () and bore the Kalinowa coat of arms. After graduating from a local school in ≈öwis≈Çocz (now Svislach in Belarus) in 1855 he went to Moscow, where he started studying at private law school. Soon he moved to St. Petersburg, where he continued his studies at the University of St. Petersburg and got involved in several Polish students' conspiracies and secret cultural societies. After graduating in 1860 he returned to the area of Hrodna, where he continued to work as a revolutionary. He also started publishing Mu≈ºyckaja prauda (Commoner's truth), one of the first periodicals in Belarusian (written in ≈Åacinka) and two other Polish language clandestine newspapers. In his literary work, Kalino≈≠ski underlined the need to liberate all peoples of the former Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth from Russia's occupation and to conserve and promote the Greek-Catholic faith and Belarusian language. He also promoted the idea of activisation of peasants for the cause of national liberation, the idea that was until then dominated by the gentry. He also referred to the good traditions of democracy, tolerance and freedom of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, as opposed to national oppression of cultures dominated by Imperial Russia. After the outbreak of the January Uprising he was involved in the secret Provincial Lithuanian Committee in Vilnius (Prowincjonalny Litewski Komitet w Wilnie). Soon he was promoted to the commissar of the Polish government for the Grodno Voivodeship. His writings made him popular both among the peasants and the gentry, which enabled the partisan units under his command to grow rapidly. Because of his successes he was promoted to the rank of Plenipotentiary Commissar of the Government for Lithuania (Komisarz Pe≈Çnomocny RzƒÖdu na Litwƒô), which made him the commander-in-chief of all partisan units fighting in the areas of today's' Eastern Poland, Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine. A tablet marking the Kalinowski's execution site, Luki≈°kƒós Square, Vilnius  Last months, execution and interment  However, after initial successes against the Russian armies, the Russians moved a 120,000 men strong army to the area and the revolutionaries started to lose most of the skirmishes. Finally Kalinowski was betrayed by one of his soldiers and handed over to the Russians. He was imprisoned in Vilnius, where he wrote one of his most notable works - the Letter from Beneath the Gallows (Pismo z-pad szybienicy), a passionate credo for his compatriots. He was then tried by a court martial for leading the revolt against Russia and sentenced to death. He was publicly executed on Luki≈°kƒós Square in Vilnius on 22 March 1864, at age 26. The remains of the executed insurgent, along with others, were clandestinely buried by the Tsarist authorities in the site of a military fortress on top of the Gediminas Hill in Vilnius. The remains were excavated and positively identified in 2019 and were solemnly re-interred in the Rasos Cemetery on 22 November 2019.  See also  * Long Live Belarus!

He also played for the St. Louis Browns (1951‚Äì52), Chicago White Sox (1953) and Washington Senators (1953). Byrne batted and threw left-handed. Byrne attended the Baltimore City College high school and Wake Forest College. Baseball career Byrne was a hard-thrower pitcher who never hesitated to pitch inside, but he had really struggled with his control most of his career, earning him the nickname \\"Wild Man\\". After making his debut on April 27, 1943, he had four years with more than 130 innings pitched and more than 6 walks per nine innings, a record later tied by Nolan Ryan. Byrne led the league in hit batsmen five times and in walks three times. Despite his wildness, he won 15 games twice (1949‚Äì50) and enjoyed a career season in with a 16-5 record and a 3.15 ERA, and led the league in winning percentage (.762). But Byrne was a dangerous hitter. He hit well enough during his career to be called on by his managers for pinch-hitting duties. He batted .238 in his career (143-for-601) with 14 home runs and 98 RBI in 377 games, including two grand slams and 80 pinch hits. In a 13-year career, Byrne posted an 85-69 record with a 4.11 ERA in 1362 innings. He had a disappointing 0.74 strikeout-to-walk ratio (766-to-1037). In four World Series, he went 2-2 with 11 strikeouts and a 2.53 ERA in 21.1 innings. He made the American League All-Star team in . He played his final regular-season game on September 21, 1957 before ending his career in the World Series defeat to the Milwaukee Braves. Later life After the conclusion of his baseball career, Byrne returned to Wake Forest, North Carolina, where he had attended college (although the college had since relocated to Winston-Salem). Prior to the 1963 season, he joined the New York Mets organization as a minor league scout. When Clyde McCullough was promoted to the Mets as a coach, Byrne took over the manager's job for the Raleigh Mets of the Carolina League. He managed the team from July 29 through the end of the season.The Sporting News, August 10, 1963, page 41. \\"Tommy Byrne Takes Raleigh Reins in Managerial Debut.\\" Byrne later became mayor of Wake Forest from 1973 through 1987.http://www.nbc17.com/midatlantic/ncn/news.apx.-content- articles-NCN-2007-09-09-0018.html He died on December 20, 2007 at age 87 in Wake Forest, North Carolina, eleven days before his 88th birthday.

WYOO airs talk radio programming. History WYOO began broadcasting on December 1, 1993 on 101.3 MHz as an extension of WLTG, and was branded as such (it was marketed as WLTG-FM). The station's frequency was changed to 101.1 MHz in December 1996. Styles Media (now Magic Broadcasting) purchased WYOO in 1996. At that time the station was operating in a small room on the second floor of the Nationwide Fitness Building. The station was moved into its current building on 23rd street which also housed two of other radio stations. Talk Radio was operating at low power and the signal was carried by a telephone line in mono. The sales people had to work out of their cars. There was no office. Styles Media applied to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and received approval to upgrade the signal. WYOO bought a new transmitter, built a new tower and studio and added new programming. In August 1998, a live morning show was put on the air, and the station carried the live simulcast of Channel 7 at that time from 5 to 5:30 pm. Talk Radio 101 was nominated for Talk Station of the Year that year and also had record ratings and revenue. In February 2000, the radio station was sold to NextMedia, a company from Colorado. Under the branding of \\"101.1 FM/The Buzz\\", the format was changed from a conservative one to a \\"liberal/hot\\" talk format. Shows like Liz Wilde, Tom Leykis, and Bob and Sherri were brought in, and the conservative shows that Styles Media had were cancelled. The ratings plummeted. NextMedia eventually sought to revamp the schedule again. It hired a new program director and morning show host, Doc Washburn. He quickly added several popular talk shows to the lineup, dropping G. Gordon Liddy in favor of Mike Gallagher and adding Clark Howard and Sean Hannity (who replaced Dr. Laura) to the lineup. Michael Savage had already been put on WYOO when Washburn took over. Washburn was eventually able to talk station management into adding Neal Boortz to the lineup. In June 2002, NextMedia, decided to sell WYOO and its sister stations and offered them back to Styles Media. In April 2003, Styles Media management dumped the first two hours of the Clark Howard show for Bill O'Reilly. In December 2003, Washburn talked management into replacing Mike Gallagher with Glenn Beck. In September 2004 (with WYOO enjoying its best ratings in several years), morning show host Doc Washburn disappeared from the airwaves after spending 3¬Ω years developing an audience. Eventually, long-time DJ Rob Stark took over the morning show on WYOO. No public mention was ever made explaining the change. Stark lasted 7¬Ω months and was replaced by \\"The Attack Machine\\" from Gainesville, FL. Stark eventually wound up hosting the morning show of country station WAKT (Kat Kountry) across town. In December 2006, the Attack Machine moved their show to Birmingham at WYDE. The call sign has previously been used for an AM/FM simulcast called \\"U100\\" that existed from 1974 to 1976 in Minneapolis-St. Paul. On-air hosts Current notable on-air hosts include Clyde Lewis, Mark Levin, Rick and Bubba, Alex Jones, Sean Hannity, Michael Savage, and George Noory. Notable former programming includes The Attack Machine, Imus in the Morning, Rush Limbaugh, Dr. Dean Edell, Rob Stark, Doc Washburn, Mike Gallagher, Michael Medved, Dr. Laura, and G. Gordon Liddy.

The story is a coming-of-age tale set during the early 1980s in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It was Chabon's first novel, which he began writing as a 21-year-old undergraduate at the University of Pittsburgh. He continued to work on it during his studies (1985‚Äì87) in the Creative Writing Program of the Department of English at the University of California, Irvine, where he submitted it as his thesis for the Master of Fine Arts degree. One of his advisors, the novelist MacDonald Harris, sent it to his literary agent. It was published in 1988 and became a bestseller. A film adaptation‚Äîstarring Jon Foster, Sienna Miller, Peter Sarsgaard, and Nick Nolte‚Äîwas released in 2009. Plot summary Art Bechstein is the son of a mob money launderer, who wants him to succeed in a legitimate career (He has even set up a job for him at the end of the summer in Baltimore at a financial firm managed by one of his old friends.). When Art graduates from the University of Pittsburgh, he has only a vague hope for a summer of adventure before he commits to the rest of his life. Bechstein almost immediately meets a charming young gay gentleman, Arthur Lecomte, and his friend, a highly literate biker, Cleveland Arning, who become his partners in many summer adventures. Art begins a relationship with an insecure young woman named Phlox Lombardi. As Art's attraction to Arthur grows, it destabilizes both relationships and reveals he may be bisexual. Art is also troubled when Cleveland begins moving deeper into the city's organized crime families, drawing him closer to his father's dangerous mob connections. Art's relationships with his dog, friends, and lovers become more and more entangled, causing a series of fallings out and unforeseen consequences. Settings The novel takes place during summer. It begins in April, just after Bechstein has finished his four-year undergraduate education at the University of Pittsburgh. Specific settings include Carnegie Mellon University, Chatham College, Hillman Library, Lake Erie, Presbyterian University Hospital, Schenley Park, Schenley Bridge, and the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Oakland, Squirrel Hill, Shadyside, Downtown, Mount Washington, East Liberty, Fox Chapel, and Highland Park. A boiler plant, informally labeled The Cloud Factory, located in Junction Hollow between Carnegie Mellon University and the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, plays a special role in the novel. Literary significance and criticism Because of the book's straightforward, even playful, treatment of gay love and bisexuality, Chabon was early-on identified as a gay writer. He has frequently been asked if this identification concerned him; his usual reply is that he worries that gay readers might feel he was being presented to them, under false pretenses, as one of their own. A recently reissued edition featured an Author's Note entitled \\"P.S.\\", which details some of the novel's inspiration, problems, and process. For example, he often had to balance his early-model computer precariously on an old tool table. Many fans of his work asked about Chabon's sexuality, because of the gay characters in his novels. On page 12 of the expanded Notes section, he reveals that, although he is currently married to a woman, he has had same-sex relationships in the past.On The Mysteries of Pittsburgh: Essay by Michael Chabon He also describes some of his inspirations, crediting experiences with Marcel Proust, The Great Gatsby, and Philip Roth as encouraging him to write.

It is a community model maintained by Penn State University and the National Center for Atmospheric Research. The MM5 is a limited-area, terrain-following sigma coordinate model that is used to replicate or forecast mesoscale and regional scale atmospheric circulation.http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/mm5/overview.html It has been updated many times since the 1970s to fix bugs, adapt to new technologies, and work on different types of computers and software. It is used in many different ways: for research and for weather prediction. In research, it is used to compare it to other models, to see what works and what does not work. It is also used for air quality models.http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/mm5/workshop/ws03/sessionJ1/Klausmann.pdf Active development on the model ended with version 3.7.2 in 2005, and it has been largely superseded by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Features MM5 is globally relocatable, which helps support different latitudes, terrain types, elevations, soil types, etc. . The model can be either hydrostatic or non-hydrostatic, depending on the desired outcome. The fact that the model is regional implies that it requires initial conditions and lateral boundary conditions. This means that each boundary (there are four) has initialized wind speeds, temperatures, pressure and moisture fields.http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/mm5/documents/MM5_tut_Web_notes/INTRO/intro.htm Thus, gridded data is needed for this program. This model takes and then analyzes its data based on pressure surfaces. However, these surfaces must first be interpolated by a specific vertical coordinate before it can be analyzed. This vertical coordinate, sigma, is computed and then used throughout the program. Œ£ is defined as: Œ£ = (p-pt)/p*, p* = ps-pt, Where p is pressure, ps is surface pressure, and pt is the pressure at the top of the model.http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/mm5/documents/mm5-code-pdf/sec1.pdf When Œ£ is close to the ground, the program follows the actual terrain, but when Œ£ is higher up, the program looks at isobaric surfaces. Œ£ ranges from 0 to 1. It has adaptable and multiple nesting capabilities, which allows multiple programs to run at once, while utilizing 2-way nesting. MM5 features inputs from actual data, which is helpful because routine observations can be used. Then, data can be compared and used in context with other models. MM5 also features terrain-following vertical coordinates and four-dimensional data assimilation (FDDA) . FDDA is used when there is a lot of data that was taken over a longer period of time. Then this data that needed to be taken over a longer period of time gets placed into FDDA. It is also utilized for dynamical initialization and four-dimensional data sets. Most importantly, MM5 is well documented and has many places for user support. Functions There are many pieces of the MM5 modeling system, each with different functions. These pieces include: TERRAIN, REGRID, LITTLE_R, NESTDOWN, INTERPF, INTERPB, and GRAPH/RIP. In the basic sense, the model begins by taking the information and then makes a model of the land. This is done by using the piece TERRAIN.http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/mm5/overviewProgram.html Then, the model guesses the different pressures that exist in the atmosphere throughout this plot of land, which is done through REGRID. Then, the model takes these guesses, and with the help of some surface observations, can create an objective analysis, using LITTLE_R.http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/mm5/On-Line- Tutorial/little_r/little_r.html RAWINS is an older version of LITTLE_R and thus LITTLE_R is more commonly used. Then INTERPF takes that data from RAWINS/LITTLE_R and REGRID to interpolate that data to the sigma coordinate explained above. MM5 itself computes the time combination. The NESTDOWN function has the ability to change the vertical sigma levels. INTERPB generates the first guess for RAWINS, as well as gathers the files used to make guesses for REGRID. Finally, GRAPH/RIP generates the plots that users can view from all of the data given from the other programs. RIP stands for Read/Interpolate/Plot, and it uses NCAR Graphics to help envisage the output from the MM5.http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/mm5/On-Line-Tutorial/rip/rip.html Flow chart of the functions of the MM5 Memory and code basics MM5 is written in FORTRAN. These FORTRAN programs must be compiled on a local computer, and some need to be recompiled each time a model configuration is changed.http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/mm5/documents/MM5_tut_Web_notes/START/start.htm The program uses pointers to assign variables to values. These pointers go into parts of the memory to assign specific values to the desired variables.http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/mm5/documents/mm5-code-pdf/sec2.pdf MM5 can also perform multiple tasks at once. Specifically, two different tasks can be executed on different processors simultaneously and MM5 uses this as much as possible. This multi-tasking also uses nesting, and MM5 allows up to nine domains (processes) running at the same time and they interact throughout the whole process . The model utilizes two-way nesting, which occurs when the input from one nest's coarse mesh, which is a high density of cells in one area, comes from one of the four boundaries, but the feedback to the coarser mesh happens through the nest interior. Each domain gathers information from its parent domain each timestep, then it runs three timesteps, and then delivers the information back to its parent domain. There are three different ways to do two-way nesting: Nest interpolation, nest analysis input, and nest terrain input. Interpolation occurs when the terrain is smooth, such as water. There is no input that is required for this type of two-way nesting. Nest input requires a file called MMINPUT, and that file contains the meteorological and the terrain information so that initially, a better analysis can be done. Finally terrain input requires a TERRAIN file. Then the meteorological fields are interpolated. When multi-tasking occurs, the variables must be marked as either shared or private. Shared implies that the processors all have access to the same part of memory, while private implies that each processor must have its own private copy of an array with its personal memory location. The multi-tasking occurs specifically in the subroutines Solve1, Solve3, and Sound. Requirements MM5 can be run in many different ways, depending on the computer. The model can be run on a single processor computer, shared memory architecture or distributed memory architecture. It can be run on many different platforms as well such as IBM, SGI origin 200/2000, CRAYs (J90, C90, T3E), DEC_Alphas, Alphas running Linux, Sun, and more. The computer it is run on must have a Fortran 90 and 77 compilers and a C compiler. Additionally, it can have NCAR graphics and MPI tools for running the MPI MM5 model. However, this is not necessary. The MM5 model takes up at least half a gigabyte of memory and a few gigabytes of disk space.http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/mm5/overviewFeatures.html Source code The MM5 code itself has over 220 subroutines, with more than 55,000 lines of code.ww2.mmm.ucar.edu It uses Standard Fortran 77 with ‚ÄúCray‚Äù pointers. A list of the subroutines of all of the functions within the MM5, with a short description and the routines that are called within it can be found here.http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/mm5/documents/mm5-code-pdf/sec5.pdf  Use  The MM5 had been adapted for use in many different types of atmospheric simulations: * Real-time regional weather forecasts http://cheget.msrc.sunysb.edu/html/alt_mm5.cgihttp://www.atmos.umd.edu/~mm5http://helios.aos.wisc.edu * Tropical cyclone prediction * Climate change simulation and projection http://www.atmos.washington.edu/~salathe/reg_climate_mod/ECHAM-MM5 Developments and improvements TERRAIN's latest update uses USGS global 30 sec terrain elevation data, which looks at the entire world, where before was only used in the continental United States.http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/mm5/overviewRecent.html This new update also allows for a better quality terrain image that can be used in MM5. REGRID's improvement makes it simpler for its users to input the data and it also is more portable. LIITLE_R was developed in 2001 to replace RAWINS. LITTLE_R's improvement again makes it easier for users to input data.

It switched the images presented to each eye to distort depth perception.A pseudoscope is a binocular optical instrument that reverses depth perception. It is used to study human stereoscopic perception. Objects viewed through it appear inside out, for example: a box on a floor would appear as a box shaped hole in the floor. It typically uses sets of optical prisms, or periscopically arranged mirrors to swap the view of the left eye with that of the right eye. Purpose In the 1800s Charles Wheatstone coined the name from the Greek œàŒµœÖŒ¥ŒØœÇ œÉŒ∫ŒøœÄŒµŒπŒΩ -- \\"false view\\". The device was used to explore his theory of stereo vision. Experimental Psychology p.146 by Edward Bradford Titchener, Macmillan, 1906 https://targetfrog.com/best-marine-binoculars/ Basically, Pseudoscopic is 3D in reverse. That is, in aerial photography, swimming pools appear to look like buildings and buildings appear to look like swimming pools. In red and green plotters like the Kelsh and Multiplex this is achieved by reversing the lenses on the 3D glasses. The images will be reverse order. The right image will be viewed through the left eye, and the left image will be through the right eye. Effect Switching the two pictures in a standard stereoscope changes all the elevated parts into depressions, and vice versa. The pseudoscope also changes convex into concave, and high-relief into low-relief. Modern prismatic pseudoscope by Charles Whetstone's scheme History Pseudoscopic binocular microscope design by Father Cherubin d'Orleans, 1677Before the pseudoscope itself was created intentionally, it existed in binocular instruments as an imperfection. The first binocular microscope was invented by the Capuchin monk Cherubin d'Orleans. Because his instrument consisted of two inverting systems, it produced a pseudoscopic impression of depth by accident, although not recognized by microscopists of the time. G. M. Stratton's mirror pseudoscopeThe instrument subsequently fell into complete neglect for nearly two centuries. It was revived in 1852 by Charles Wheatstone, who published his ideas in his paper \\"On Binocular Vision,\\" in the Philosophical Transactions for 1852. Wheatstone's paper stimulated the investigation of binocular vision and many variations of pseudoscopes were created, chief types being the mirror or the prismatic. In 1853 the American scientist John Leonard Riddell (1807-1865) devised his binocular microscope, which contained the essentials of Wheatstone's pseudoscope.

Property within the Malibu Ozarks is generally beyond the first mountain range and outside the incorporated city limits of Malibu itself (despite its city zip code). Some people define true Malibu Ozarks property by an 818 home telephone prefix. By contrast, all seaside Malibu property is wired for 310 home area code telephone service. As a rule, \\"818 Malibu\\" property is five or more miles distant from the Pacific Ocean. The dividing line between the two area codes is roughly at Mulholland Highway, which runs along or near the ridgeline of the Santa Monica Mountains. Some of the areas that might be considered part of the Malibu Ozarks are actually within Agoura Hills city limits, especially areas around Malibou Lake and those near Troutdale. Although homes and property in the Malibu Ozarks may easily cost more than one million dollars (and a number of estates and ranches are valued in the tens of millions), even wealthy people living within the Malibu Ozarks often live off- road and rely on septic tank systems, a rural aspect that afflicts the rest of Malibu; there is no public sewer service, so every residence in Malibu has a septic system, which results in ocean-pollution at most beaches where the houses are at sea level.

The station is currently owned by Davis Broadcasting Inc. Its city of license is Decatur, Georgia, with its studios and offices in Suwanee along with its two sister stations, 102.3 WLKQ-FM (\\"La Raza\\") and 96.5 W243CE (\\"La Mega\\"). WJZA is also heard on an FM translator station, 101.1 W266BW but is currently silent due to being taken off-the-air by the FCC due to interference complaints from WLJA-FM in Ellijay, Georgia. Programming is also simulcast on 100.1 WNSY in Talking Rock, Georgia, covering the northwest suburbs of Atlanta.  Programming  WJZA's smooth jazz format was soft-launched in October 2017 to fill in the void of a dedicated smooth jazz outlet that has been missing from the Atlanta market since 2012. The station features the voices of prominent radio broadcasters: Sandy Kovach, Miranda Wilson, Allen Kepler, and Maria Lopez. Programming is also lived-streamed on its website, SmoothJazzATL.  History  In mid-December, 2012, the then-WPBC came back on the air broadcasting under an agreement with The Talk Radio, LLC, headed by longtime Latino community figure Teodoro Maus. During full-power (2,500 watts) daytime operation, the station aired a Spanish language talk radio format. At night it featured Reggie Gay's Urban Gospel Music service. In July 2011, Hanmi Broadcasting, Inc. requested the Federal Communications Commission grant a special temporary authority (STA) for WPBC to go silent after a local marketing agreement (LMA) ended abruptly. In April 2011, the station entered into a Local Marketing Agreement with WZBN's Reggie Gay and adopted WZBN's format of Contemporary Gospel/Holy Hip Hop music. WJZA transmitting tower is located in the middle of a MARTA employee parking lot at the Avondale train station. In 2002, MARTA conducted a study to renovate the entire College Station area known as: Decatur - \\"Avondale MARTA Station Study Livable Centers Initiative\\", including the station's parking lot. In 2007, another study was conducted, but there have been no further announcements found online to date. Since 2007, no renovation of the area has begun, and no new announcements have been made by either MARTA or Dekalb county regarding this initiative. Should this plan come to fruition, at some point, this may affect the tower/transmitter site which would then have to seek permission to be relocated in accordance with FCC rules and regulations. WPBC's programming consisted of a progressive talk format during the week and mostly jazz on the weekends as of August 6, 2010. The progressive talk format moved to Green 1640 AM in Decatur, Georgia in April 2011 upon WPBC's LMA with Reggie Gay's WZBN that brought about the format change to urban gospel. Prior to August 6, 2010, WPBC broadcast a Korean music and talk format with the \\"Atlanta Radio Korea\\" branding. Radio Korea is now broadcasting on WPBS AM 1040.

Publication history The Geomancers appeared in various comic titles published by Valiant Comics, including Eternal Warrior, Archer and Armstrong, Solar, Rai, Timewalker, Magnus and Secret Weapons. A separate Geomancer comic series was published in 1994, lasting eight issues. Fictional character biography Geomancers are a lineage of men and women who, since 3500 BC, have been chosen by the Earth itself to defend it, with one Geomancer operating at a time. In the Viking era, it was a young boy. When a Geomancer dies, his or her chosen successor takes their place. When a Geomancer has reached the end of their life-cycle their power is removed by a suicide ritual called Bagh-Nakh. Geomancers were instrumental in many pivotal events in the Valiant Universe, including the Unity Conflict, the birth and upbringing of Magnus, Robot Fighter, the struggle against the Darque Power and the Harbinger Wars. Gilad Anni-Padda served as the \\"Fist and Steel\\" of the Geomancers for most of his life, failing three times to save a Geomancer.

It is a compatible superset of the Atari BASIC that was built-in to most Atari machines of the era. Turbo-Basic XL greatly improves execution over Atari BASIC. An Atari BASIC program loaded into Turbo-BASIC, with no changes made, would generally run about three times as fast. A Turbo-Basic XL compiler created binary executables, further speeding up program performance to about ten times faster than Atari BASIC. Turbo-Basic XL also includes an expanded editor, support for named procedures, and similar block constructs, and added access to the underlying hardware, which, among other things, allowed operation of attached floppy drives without exiting to DOS. Turbo-Basic XL was developed by Frank Ostrowski and published in the December 1985 issue of German computer magazine Happy Computer. A version for the 400/800 models was released shortly after, known as Frost Basic 1.4. Several modified versions working with different DOS systems have also been released by other authors. Ostrowski soon got a job with GFA Systemtechnik GmbH (at the time known as Integral Hydraulik) where he adapted Turbo-Basic XL into GFA BASIC for the Atari ST, which became one of the more popular BASICs on that platform. Background Since their release in 1979, the 8-bit family normally shipped with a version of Atari BASIC on a ROM cartridge, or built into the internal ROMs on later machines. This version of BASIC had a number of custom commands that allowed partial access to the system's advanced features like graphics and sound. It was notoriously slow, appearing at the very bottom of the list of microcomputer BASICs in the original version of David Ahl's Creative Computing benchmark. The poor performance of the official Atari BASIC led to a market for 3rd party BASIC interpreters with better performance or more commands. Among them was an official port of Microsoft BASIC sold by Atari, several improved versions released by Optimized Systems Software, who had written the original Atari BASIC under contract, and many others. There were also several Atari BASIC compilers from a variety of vendors. Turbo-Basic XL was a late entry to this list, first published in December 1985 as type-in program. It was unique in that it came in both interpreter and compiler versions. It included code to take advantage of the expanded memory available on the XL series machines, and later XE series. This meant that it could not run on the original 400/800 systems, which led Ostrowski to make a port known as Frost BASIC (short for \\"Frank Ostrowski\\") that was tied to Atari DOS 2.0. The internal disk-related commands were tied to particular versions of DOS. A number of ports to different versions of DOS became available. Speed improvements The most notable feature of Turbo-Basic was its dramatically improved speed; an unmodified Atari BASIC program loaded into Turbo-Basic would normally run three to five times faster, and the speed advantage improved as the program size grew. This was due largely to a series of improvements on well-known problems in the original Atari BASIC code. In most BASICs, GOTO was handled by reading the associated line number and then searching through the program for that line of code. In MS-derived BASICs the line numbers were stored as 16-bit integers and numeric constants in the code in their original ASCII format. When a line like was encountered, the interpreter would use special code to convert the \\"1000\\" into 16-bit format and then search for it. Atari BASIC worked differently, converting all numeric constants to a 6-byte floating- point format when the line was entered. This meant the \\"1000\\" was no longer in ASCII format and had to be converted from floating-point to integer format. The code for doing so was not well optimized and could take up to 3500 ms. FOR...NEXT loops are another common construct in BASIC programs. In most BASICs, when the FOR portion was encountered at runtime, its memory location in the source code was pushed onto a call stack so it could easily return to that location when the associated NEXT was encountered. For unknown reasons, Atari BASIC pushed the line number of the FOR onto the stack and then looked through the entire code for that line when it encountered the NEXT. For programs that did significant looping, which is often the case in BASIC, this could cause a dramatic performance hit. Turbo-Basic implemented its FOR loops using the address, as was the case in MS BASIC, and thus ran loops with roughly the same performance as MS. It then went further and greatly improved GOTO performance as well. Line numbers were sent into a hash function that broke them into 256-line chunks. As the program was entered, the address of the first of each of these chunks was stored in a 128-value table. At runtime, when a line number lookup was needed, it would first pick the nearest-but- lower value in the table, retrieve the address, and then begin scanning for the line from that point on. The improvement was most notable in larger programs where the scanning time was increasingly expensive, which is why Turbo-Basic could hit a 5-times increase in larger programs. The other major source of poor performance in Atari BASIC was its very slow binary coded decimal (BCD) floating point code. The library, contained in a separate 2k ROM and considered part of the operating system as opposed to BASIC itself, had been written in a hurry and never optimized. Some of the routines, notably the multiply and exponents functions, were far slower than they could be. Turbo- Basic fixed this by including its own complete floating-point library, which not only fixed many of these issues but also further optimized the code by unrolling small loops. For programs that used math extensively, the new library resulted in dramatic performance improvements, sending the Atari from near the bottom of the Ahl benchmark lists to near the top, beating a number of machines that were much faster in hardware.

The purpose of SOE was to conduct espionage, sabotage and reconnaissance in occupied Europe and Asia against the Axis powers, especially Nazi Germany. In France, SOE agents allied themselves with French Resistance groups and supplied them with weapons and equipment parachuted in from England. Cammaerts was the creator and the organiser (leader) of the Jockey network (or circuit) in southeastern France in 1943 and 1944. At the beginning of World War II in 1939, Cammaerts declared himself a conscientious objector, but in 1942 he joined the SOE. He recruited and supplied with arms and training a large number of resistance networks and cells over an extensive area east of the Rhone River extending to the border with Italy and north from the Mediterranean Sea to the city of Grenoble. Despite being very careful in his work, Cammaerts was captured by the Germans in August 1944, but saved from execution by his courier, Christine Granville. Of the more than 450 SOE agents who worked in France during World War II, M.R.D. Foot, the official historian of the SOE, named Cammaerts as one of the half-dozen best male agents. He was one of only three SOE agents to be promoted to the rank of Lt. Colonel, along with George Starr and Richard Heslop. Early life Cammaerts was born in London and raised in Radlett in Hertfordshire, the son of Professor Emile Cammaerts, a Belgian poet, and Tita Brand, a successful actress. He was educated at Mill Hill School, where he was a contemporary of Francis Crick and Patrick Troughton. He became a pacifist in the 1930s while at Cambridge, where he read English and history at St Catharine's and also won a hockey Blue. After university he briefly began a teaching career. He taught in Belfast before moving on to Beckenham and Penge County School for Boys, near London, where he taught with his close friend from university, Harry R√©e who also joined the SOE. In 1940 Cammaerts was refused registration as a conscientious objector by his Local Tribunal, but it was granted by the Appellate Tribunal, conditional upon him taking up agricultural work. He joined a farm training project at Holton cum Beckering, Lincolnshire. During this period he met Nancy Findlay (Nan), and they married on 15 March 1941. After the death of his brother Pieter while serving in the Royal Air Force, Cammaerts believed he could no longer stand aside from participation in the war, and, as a French speaker, he succumbed to the urging of Harry R√©e to join SOE. SOE service SOE networks in France, June 1943. =A frightening beginning= Cammaerts began extensive training with SOE in October 1942. Training included fieldwork experience in the New Forest, Scotland and Manchester. Cammaerts was considered by some of his training officers to be lacking in physical skills, and 'more intellectual than practical'. Nevertheless he was considered to be above average in all areas. He was given the rank of captain and the code name Roger, and flown into occupied northern France in March 1943. More than a dozen SOE circuits were active in France at that time. Cammaerts was assigned to the Donkeyman network or circuit, then operating in the upper Rh√¥ne Valley, but his reception party from Donkeyman and the Carte network drove him first to Paris, with a dangerous disregard for security that alerted him to the risks of such behaviour. Cammaerts concern was heightened by his appearance. He was 193 cm (six feet, four inches) tall with feet so large his nickname in France was \\"Big Feet.\\" He spoke French with a noticeable Belgian accent. Cammaerts worries about security were confirmed one day after he arrived in Paris when Carte leader, Andr√© Marsac, was arrested by the Germans. Cammaerts fled Paris by train to Annecy Near Annecy in the village of Saint Jorioz he met with Odette Sansom, Alexander Rabinowitch, and Auguste Floiras of the Spindle network. Once again his antenna warned him of the poor security of Spindle and he departed after two or three days for Cannes. Rabinovitch declined to work with Cammaerts because his \\"appearance was too English\\" and he spoke French with an \\"atrocious\\" accent, but gave him the address of a safe house in Cannes. Floiras would soon join Cammerts and become his best friend and wireless operator; Sansom and several other members of the Spindle network were arrested and imprisoned shortly after Cammaerts departed Saint Jorioz. He spent a month in Cannes establishing his cover story as a teacher recovering from jaundice. =Security= Cammaerts worked primarily in rural areas. SOE networks were more secure in rural areas which had a much smaller presence of German soldiers and milice, the pro-German French militia, than large urban areas. In the words of the official historian of the SOE M.R.D. Foot, impeccable security, the hallmark of the best SOE agents, characterized Cammaert's survival as an SOE agent for two tours totaling fifteen months, far longer than the average agent served or survived in France. Cammaerts never stayed in the same house for more than three or four nights, he avoided hotels as their registers were checked by German and French police, and he also avoided large train stations which frequently had check points. He never told anybody his plans, nor made appointments nor visited unknown addresses without careful reconnoitering. He did not communicate in writing or by telephone, nor did he know the real names of the people he worked with, only their field names. He had a squad of seven or eight men who followed and investigated potential recruits before they were contacted and he divided his recruits and associates into cells of no more than 15 persons each and discouraged contact between cells. Cammerts told his agents to always have a credible reason for being where they were if stopped by a German patrol. While seeking air-tight security, Cammaerts said that he always informed the families in the places he spent nights, usually rural farmhouses or in villages, that he was English and left them no doubt of the danger they were in by hosting him. He was always received, he said, with \\"open arms.\\" As in the case of others who operated in enemy-held territory for prolonged periods, he gave a great deal of credit to the ordinary French citizens who had provided him and his colleagues with safety and comfort. In the BBC TV series Secret Agent, broadcast in 2000, Cammaerts said, \\"The most important element was the French housewife who fed us, clothed us and kept us cheerful.\\" =Jockey network= Disillusioned with what he had seen of the Carte Organization and the Spindle network, Cammaerts organised his own circuit (Jockey). He worked initially in the area of Mont√©limar. His first associate was wireless operator Auguste Fioras, a man as cautious as Cammaerts himself. The first message the pair sent to London was on 27 May 1943. Fioras would transmit 416 wireless messages to London during 1943 and 1944, a record for SOE wireless operators. In the latter part of 1943 Cammaerts established several small semi-autonomous groups of resisters to the German occupation. They were located along the left bank of the Rh√¥ne between Vienne and Arles and eastwards through the hinterland and into the Alps. He traveled around on a motorbike visiting each group. By the end of 1943 Cammaerts had ensured that his Jockey circuit was ready to play its part in any sabotage that might be required. In November 1943 he was recalled to London for debriefing, and, while there, he raised the problem of the among between the different SOE agents working in France, some under the command of General Charles de Gaulle's headquarters and others, many of them French citizens, under the command of SOE's French section. The Gaullists believed that it was unconstitutional for French citizens to be recruited by a foreign power. As Britain and the Free French were fighting for the same cause, this might seem a very minor quibble. It was never entirely resolved, however, and de Gaulle insisted that all SOE operations in France ceased soon after the liberation of Paris in August 1944. On his return to France in February 1944, Cammaerts' aircraft crashed on landing, although he was unhurt. He went on to check that his Jockey circuit was operational and later visited the 3,000+ group of Maquisards (young Frenchmen who had fled to the Vercors plateau to avoid being sent for forced labour in Germany). In April 1944 he informed SOE's London headquarters that the Vercors had a finely organised army, but they needed long-distance and anti-tank weapons. Cammaerts' Jockey circuit played its part following the Normandy Landings: they and the other SOE circuits cut railway lines and helped to severely hinder German troop and machinery movements. Cammaerts was appointed head of Allied missions in southeastern France. By this time he had built up an organisation of more than 10,000 people. The situation in the area of the Vercors plateau did not fare so well, with London having refused Cammaerts' and others' requests to provide the Resistance with heavy weapons. Allied High Command felt, based on the Yugoslav experience, that guerrillas were not trained to stand and fight. Cammaerts understood and was even sympathetic to this view, but he had no control over the belief by French Resistance leaders that, with Allied landings taking place in the north, the war was coming to an end and the Germans were fatally weakened. In fact, Vercors was attacked by two German divisions complete with air support, and German reprisals were ruthless. It was a rout and the surviving Maquisards fled to whatever hiding places they could find, with an estimated 600-plus maquisards and civilians slaughtered. =Arrest and release= Despite his meticulous care for security, on 13 August 1944, two days before the Allied Operation Dragoon landings in southern France, Cammaerts, Xan Fielding, an SOE agent who had previously operated in Crete, and a French officer, Christian Sorensen, were arrested at a roadblock by the Gestapo at Digne-les-Bains. Cammaerts had received a large amount of money for operations which he divided among the three of them, an action that would prove a mistake. Entering Digne by automobile, they came upon a German checkpoint. Under questioning, Fielding denied knowing the other two, but a young German civilian examining their forged identity papers noticed that the serial numbers of the money each of them carried was in the same series, thus indicating a connection among them. The three were taken to Digne prison and roughly interrogated. They claimed they were involved in black marketing to account for the money. The Germans apparently did not know they had captured Cammaerts, the most important SOE agent in southeastern France, but decided to execute the three suspecting they were associated with the French resistance. m. On August 17, Krystyna Skarbek, a.k.a. Christine Granville, a Polish-born SOE operative and Cammaerts' lover,Mulley, Clare (2012), The Spy who Loved, New York: St. Martin's Press, pp 212-213 managed to get Cammaerts and the others released. She confronted two collaborators, Albert Schenck, a French liaison officer to the Gestapo, and Max Waem, a Belgian interpreter for the Gestapo, telling them that American troops would arrive within hours and that if they did not co-operate she would ensure the pair were handed over to an avenging mob of French citizenry. The collaborators agreed to the release of Cammaerts, Fielding and their French colleague, on condition of the payment of a two million franc ransom, which Skarbek obtained by an airdrop from London. The three SOE agents were to be executed on the evening of the day that Skarbek negotiated their release. The rescue of Cammaerts is fictionalized in the last episode of the British television show Wish Me Luck. =Helping the allies= Digne was liberated by the American army two days after Cammaerts was released from prison. The maquis had cleared the way for the Americans and there was little opposition. On August 20, Cammaerts and Granville met the American commander, Brigadier General Frederic B. Butler, at Sisteron who dismissed them as \\"bandits.\\" Leaving the American army behind, the two proceeded to Gap where the maquis had captured the German garrison. Several hundred Polish soldiers, soldiers in the German army, were among the captured Germans. Granville addressed the Poles with a megaphone and secured their agreement to join the Allied forces, provided that they shed their German uniforms. The Poles stripped off their uniforms. General Butler arrived and disapproved of the proceedings, threatening Cammaerts and Granville with arrest and court martial if they didn't leave. Author Arthur Funk said, \\"The historian can only wonder at Butler's short-sightedness in ignoring a British officer who knew a great deal about the terrain and the people in it.\\" Later, Cammaerts and Granville received a better reception from Butler's superior officer, General Alexander Patch, who appointed them as the liaison for the Americans with the maquis. The couple continued northward to Lyon and Paris. Cammaerts' time in occupied France ended in September 1944. He was promoted to lieutenant-colonel, awarded the Distinguished Service Order and the Legion d'honneur, Croix de Guerre and the American Medal of Freedom for his work in south-eastern France. SAARF and immediately post-war In March 1945, when the Allies had crossed the Rhine, Cammaerts was asked to join the Special Allied Airborne Reconnaissance Force (SAARF). Many of the personnel were SOE or OSS agents. Their main objective was to help in the reconstruction work in Germany after the fall of Hitler. For Cammaerts it primarily meant dealing with the appalling aftermath of the newly liberated concentration camps. Cammaerts visited Dachau, Belsen and Ravensbruck. He was appalled and felt impotent in the face of what he found. He later said 'the SAARF period was blank and grey and one of those certain areas in my life when I didn't know what I was doing'. SAARF was disbanded in July 1945. Cammaerts wanted to be transferred to work in the diplomatic world, but despite his extraordinary war record the Foreign Office considered Cammaerts to be a foreigner, as his father was Belgian, and so unable to work at the Foreign Office. In 1946 he was offered work in Brussels with the Inter-Allied Reparations Agency, and he was able to move with his family to Belgium for 18 months. In 1948 a daughter, Christine (named after Christine Granville), was born with multiple disabilities. For the remainder of her short life, Christine's circumstances played a large part in the decisions made by the Cammaerts' about their own lives. Education work and retirement In 1948 Cammaerts became the first Director of the Central Bureau for Educational Visits and Exchanges, which was a UNESCO agency and enabled him to undertake international trips including to the USA. In 1952 Cammaerts returned to teaching, with the encouragement of John Newsom and Ronald Gould. He later became the headmaster of Alleyne's Grammar School in Stevenage for nine years, at a time when Stevenage New Town was growing rapidly. Cammaerts was keen to implement the Labour Government's move towards comprehensive education, encouraged by Newsom. Alleynes enrolment increased from 170 to roughly 600 boys during Cammaert's tenure, and new classroom blocks were added. Cammaerts did not forget his wartime lover, Christine Granville. Following her murder in 1952, he became part of a group of men dedicated to ensuring that her name not be \\"sullied and succeeded in stopping several press reports and two books\\" to protect her from stories of her active and diverse sex life. Francis Cammaerts speaking in No Ordinary Countess, , accessed 25 Apr 2020C. Mulley, The Spy Who Loved, p. 338-339, 345. He was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1958 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Television Theatre. In 1959 he appeared for the defence in the notorious trial of Penguin Books over the publication of D.H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover. The trial, at the Old Bailey was front- page news and Cammaerts statement under cross-examination that he had let members of his 6th Form read the book and they did not appear to have been corrupted or become depraved, was widely reported. The publisher won the case. He was Principal of the Leicester Teacher Training college in Scraptoft, between 1961 and 1966, overseeing a liberalising of the training methods used. He then moved to Kenya to help with the development of the country's education system in the immediate post-colonial period. Cammaerts became Professor of Education in Nairobi from 1966-72. He later returned to England, to become head of Rolle College, a teacher training college at Exmouth, which later became part of University of Plymouth. In 1981, aged 65, he came out of retirement to start a teacher training college in Botswana. He had a major impact on the development of education on all levels in the country, which had the most advanced policies on the African continent. Cammaerts finally retired in 1987, returning to live in the south of France until his death in 2006. Cammaerts' nephew, children's author Michael Morpurgo, in his novel, In the Mouth of the Wolf, wrote about Cammaerts' time in the Resistance.

It drains an area of . In India, it flows through Darjeeling district and the cities of Rangpo, Jalpaiguri and Mekhliganj. It joins the Jamuna River at Fulchhari in Bangladesh.  Course  Teesta and Rangeet Confluence The Teesta River originates from the Pahunri (or Teesta Kangse) glacier above , and flows southward through gorges and rapids in the Sikkim Himalaya. It is fed by rivulets arising in the Thangu, Yumthang and Donkha mountain ranges. The river then flows past the town of Rangpo where the Rangpo River joins, and where it forms the border between Sikkim and West Bengal up to Teesta Bazaar. Just before the Teesta Bridge, where the roads from Kalimpong and Darjeeling join, the river is met by its main tributary, the Rangeet River. Teesta River Bridge Inscription At this point, it changes course southwards flowing into West Bengal. The river hits the plains at Sevoke, northeast of Siliguri, where it is spanned by the Coronation Bridge linking the northeast states to the rest of India. The river then goes merging up with the Brahmaputra River after it touches the city of Jalpaiguri and flowing between Mekhliganj and Haldibari in Cooch Behar district and moves to Fulchori in Bangladesh.  Geography  Through its course, the Teesta river has carved out ravines and gorges in Sikkim meandering through the hills with the hill station of Kalimpong lying just off the river. Variegated vegetation can be seen along this route. At lower elevations, tropical deciduous trees and shrubs cover the surrounding hills; alpine vegetation is seen at the upper altitudes. The river is flanked by white sand which is used by the construction industry in the region. Large boulders in and around the waters make it ideal for rafting enthusiasts. Between Rangpo town and the railway bridge (popularly called Lohapul or iron bridge) on it as it enters the plains at Sevoke, the Teesta flows with a very strong current, ideal for white river rafting. Towns like Teesta Bazaar and Melli have facilities for group rafting. Though the river looks innocuous, the underlying current is very strong. In 1915, G.P. Robertson, the then Municipal Engineer of Darjeeling, drowned after losing control of the boat in the turbulence while surveying the river. The boat struck a partially hidden boulder and was sucked in by a whirlpool, leaving no trace of the occupants. During the monsoons, Teesta river distends its banks; both in size and turbulence. Landslides in this region often dam up parts of the river in this season.  Changes in course of rivers  James Rennell's 1776 map shows an earlier flow of the Teesta meeting the Ganges in three channels before a devastating flood in 1787 changed its course Great changes have taken place in the course of some of the rivers in Bengal and the adjoining areas, during the period since 1500 CE. Although positive evidence is lacking, similar changes can be assumed in the remoter past. The Teesta River is one of the rivers that has changed over the years.Majumdar, R.C.(1971). History of Ancient Bengal. Tulshi Prakashani, Kolkata. Reprinted 2005. . The Teesta earlier ran due south from Jalpaiguri in three channels, namely, the Karatoya to the east, the Punarbhaba in the west and the Atrai in the centre. The three channels possibly gave the name to the river as Trisrota \\"possessed of three streams\\" which has been shortened to Teesta. Of these three, the Punarbhaba joined the Mahananda. The Atrai passing through a vast marshy area known as Chalan Beel joined the Karatoya and the united stream joined the Padma (Ganges) near Jafarganj. In the destructive floods of 1787, the Teesta river forsook its old channel and rushing south-east it joined the Brahmaputra. James Rennell made a survey between 1764 and 1777 and his maps are one of the earliest authentic maps of Bengal in existence. In these maps Teesta is shown as flowing through North Bengal in several branches‚ÄîPunarbhaba, Atrai, Karatoya, etc. All these streams combined lower down with the Mahananda, now the westernmost river in North Bengal, and taking the name of Hoorsagar finally discharged into the Ganges at Jafarganj, near modern Goalundo. The Hoorsagar river still in existence, being the combined outfall of the Baral, a spill channel of the Ganges, the Atrai, the Jamuna or Jamuneswari (not the main Jamuna through which the Brahmaputra now flows), and the Karatoya, but instead of falling into the Ganges, it falls into the main Jamuna, a few miles above its confluence with the Padma at Goalundo.Majumdar, S.C.

The Teesta Barrage is a major irrigation project in Bangladesh, in Lalmonirhat District. Construction started 1979 and was completed in 1997‚Äì98. Usage conflicts Disputes over the appropriate allocation and development of the water resources of the river have remained a subject of conflict for almost 35 years, with several bilateral agreements and rounds of talks failing to produce results. Seismic concerns Teesta river area is in the seismically active Zone-V and has experienced micro-seismic activity. According to India's Ministry of Environment & Forests, the Teesta river dam projects have been approved with the requirement that they adopt suitable seismic coefficient in the design for the dam, tunnel, surge shaft and power house. The projects are cascaded over the length of the river, do not store large amounts water, have small reservoirs, and therefore the projects are expected to have very low risk from the reservoir induced seismicity in the area.  Climate and tectonics  The Teesta river has preserved good imprints of climatic and tectonics along its valleys and catchments. The interrelationship between climate, erosion, deposition and tectonic activities is not properly understood to date. These are being studied.

It was directed by Edmund Goulding, and stars Burt Lancaster, Dorothy McGuire, Edmund Gwenn, and Millard Mitchell. The film is based on the true story of Emerich Juettner, known by the alias Edward Mueller, an elderly man who counterfeited just enough money to survive, was careful where and when he spent his fake dollar bills, and was therefore able to elude authorities for ten years, despite the poor quality of his fakes, and despite growing interest in his case. The film was based on an article by St. Clair McKelway that was first published in The New Yorker and later collected in McKelway's book True Tales from the Annals of Crime & Rascality. Edmund Gwenn, who played \\"Skipper\\" Miller (only a supporting role in the film), won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance.

Plot Boone Caudill is a young man who lives in Kentucky with his family as people are pushing further and further west in the Americas. (Boone is supposedly named after Daniel Boone, who is credited with finding Kentucky.) Boone's father is physically abusive to not only his mother, but also his brother and him. One night, his father begins to beat him after Boone had caused trouble in town, and Boone hits his father over the head with a stick from the wood pile. Knowing that his father is seriously injured, possibly even dead, he goes back to the house and steals his father's prize rifle. As a parting gift, his mother offers him a roast chicken they were going to have for supper. With that, Boone runs away.The Big Sky, Chapter I After thinking back to his childhood, he remembers his maternal uncle Zeb Calloway. The uncle was a mountain man, frequently thought of as uncivilized by his mother and father. Boone decides this is the life for him and sets off for the West and the mountains. As he walks, he meets a man with a cart and mule named Jim Deakins, who admits to Boone that he has always wanted something more from life and decides that Boone has the right idea. As they arrive into the next city, Jim decides to sell his mule and wagon for some money to travel and join Boone. However, as they get into town, Boone's father has just arrived and is intent on getting his rifle back. Boone jumps in the nearby river to get away, as Jim shouts from the banks of the river for Boone to wait for him. As Boone sets out again, he meets another traveler, Jonathan Bedwell. Bedwell gets Boone drunk and then steals his rifle, to Boone's horror. He continues to travel, now without the rifle, though intent on getting it back. However, he sees Bedwell outside of another town, and attacks him. The sheriff had been nearby and breaks them up. The sheriff takes them to court, and after a quick trial the more sophisticated Bedwell is given the rights to the rifle, as everyone believes it is his anyway. Boone is sentenced to spend time in the jail, but he refuses to admit that he did anything wrong so the sheriff flogs him in hopes of getting a confession. Meanwhile, Jim Deakins is traveling up the same path that Boone had taken. After getting the story out of the locals, he pretends to merely be curious about the goings-on. As he gets the sheriff progressively drunker, he steals the keys to the jail and sets Boone free. They go back to the inn where everyone had been drinking. Boone steals a horse and they flee the area for St. Louis.Chapter VIII Boone and Deakins travel for a while before they get recruited onto a French keelboat traveling up the Missouri River.Chapter IX There the boys meet Dick Summers, the boat's hunter and guide, who becomes a role model for Boone in particular, whose explosive temper has gotten into more trouble than he's been able to completely avoid. On the boat, the captain has a Native American princess named Teal Eye. The captain and mate have strictly forbidden any of the crew to talk to her, as they believe it will help relations with the Blackfoot chief for them to bring him back his daughter and they don't want to bring back damaged goods. Boone sneaks looks at the girl, almost instantly falling in love with her. When they reach Blackfoot country, Teal Eye disappears one night.Chapter XIX Soon after, the Blackfeet attack and destroy the keelboat and kill everyone on her except the three friends Caudill, Deakins, and Summers, who manage to escape. A good portion of the novel involves Boone Caudill becoming a fur trapper and dealing with the hardships as he moves further from civilization. Dick Summers realizes that he is too old to continue the life of a mountain man and leaves Jim Deakins and Boone Caudill to return to his land in Missouri to farm.Chapter XXV Boone continues to be obsessed with Teal Eye, and eventually he is able to find her again. By that time large numbers of the Blackfeet have been killed by smallpox. With gifts Boone manages to convince Teal Eye's brother, now the chief since the death of their father, to let him have Teal Eye, who uses sign language to tell Boone that she loves him.Chapters XXIX-XXX Jim Deakins, Teal Eye and Boone live peacefully within the tribe, Boone finally feeling as if he's found a place to fit in. Teal Eye eventually gets pregnant, to Boone's joy. However, when the child is born, he is blind. He also has red hair, like Boone's closest friend Jim Deakins. Believing Teal Eye cheated on him, Boone is crushed. He proceeds to kill Jim Deakins and leave Teal Eye, fleeing back east.Chapter XLII When Boone arrives back in Kentucky, his mother notes that there have been red heads in their family. Boone cannot tolerate his confusion and the settled life and mores in Kentucky and, depending on one's point of view, either seduces or rapes a young neighbor girl, who despite her sobbing asks when they'll get married. That same night he flees west: \\"He didn't realize he was running until he saw [his dog] trotting to keep up.\\"End of Chapter XLVII. Boone stops at Dick Summers's farm in Missouri. In a theme repeated throughout Guthrie's trilogy, Boone refers to the destruction of the pristine West the first whites had known: \\"It's all sp'iled, I reckon, Dick. The whole caboodle.\\" Boone blurts out that he killed Jim Deakins: \\"This here hand done it. ... I kilt Jim.\\"Chapter XLVIII. Rather than spend even that one night with Dick Summers, Boone Caudill flees out the door.

The Stout shared its platform with the Toyota Dyna until 1968, when the Dyna was given its own platform, called the Toyota \\"U\\". In Japan, it was sold at Toyota Japanese dealerships called Toyopet Store. First generation (1954-1960) Introduced in April 1954 as the Toyopet RK 1¬º ton truck, it was larger than the similar Toyota SG light truck but smaller than the Toyota FA medium duty truck. In 1955 it was upgraded to carry 1.5 tons. The standard body was a 2-door, 3 seater pickup with a separate well body (with a fold down tailgate). Other bodies advertised by Toyota included a van, an ambulance, double cab coupe utility (2-doors, 6 seater, integral well body), drop-side pickup, pickup with stake sides, a pickup with full height metal side with a canvas top, a light bus (precursor to the Coaster) and an ice cream van. All models used mechanicals common to new vehicles of its time, such as a ladder frame chassis, leaf springs, solid axles and 4 wheel drum brakes. The engine was the 48HP 1500 cc Type R with a manual transmission. The body was professionally finished with windscreen wipers, dual outside mirrors (1955 onwards), hubcaps, chrome trim and dual headlights. The 1954 model was designated as a 1¬º ton truck but was actually rated to carry 1220 kg. The 1955 model was designated as a 1.5 ton truck but was actually rated to carry 1330 kg. In 1957 the RK was revised to become the RK30 and the RK35. In May 1959 it was named the Stout. Its main competitor was the Nissan Junior. Second generation (1960-1978) Completely redesigned in 1960, this is the most familiar version of the Stout. The Japanese market had the 1,453 cc Type R engine in the RK45 and the 1,897 cc 3R-B engine in the RK100,\\"Toyopet Stout, Model RK45-100 Parts Catalog\\", No. 53336-64, Japan which was introduced in October 1962. Along with the new optional engine, the Stout also underwent a facelift, including twin headlights. In September 1963 there also appeared a shorter and lighter duty (type RK40) model called \\"Light Stout\\", which featured independent coil sprung front suspension for a more carlike ride.Ozeki (2007), p. 53 This was meant to compete directly with Nissan's Datsun minitrucks, but it never sold particularly well in its home market and was replaced by the Briska and Hilux following Toyota's takeover of Hino Motors. Conventional mechanical parts were used in the form of leaf springs and four-wheel drum brakes on a ladder frame chassis. Body styles include a pickup (two-door, three seater), a double-cab pickup (four-door, six seater) and a two-door panel van. The Stout was Toyota's launch model in South Africa in 1961. It sold well until its discontinuation in 1979. The RK45 Stout was the first Toyota to begin complete knock-down assembly in South Africa, in 1962. South African production later switched to the two-litre RK101 series, available as a flush-side pickup, a dropside, or a chassis/cab. South African Stouts kept using a simplified version of the original bed, even after the longer cabin had been introduced, as they were not affected by Japanese regulations on overall length. Bed length was thus , marginally longer than elsewhere. Between 1961 and 1975, 17,500 Stouts were sold in South Africa - the majority of them assembled locally. A version of the Lite Stout, equipped with the 1.9 litre 3R engine was sold in North America as the Stout 1900 between 1964 and 1969. During its first year in the American market, a total of 4 units were sold. This Lite Stout model was assembled in South Africa as well, beginning in 1965. It was called the Toyota Stallion there to distinguish it from the original model with its solid front axle, and also marked the introduction of the larger cabin to this market. This generation Stout was also assembled in Thailand, beginning in 1964. Due to complaints in export markets about limited cabin space, a new cabin expanded by was introduced. In order to stay under the Japanese maximum length of this required the design of a new rear bed for the long wheelbase versions, while the shorter models instead received a correspondingly lengthened wheelbase to accommodate the longer cab. With the introduction of the slightly larger 2R engine, the Lite Stout became the RK43, while the 1.75 ton 1500 became the RK47. There was also the RK47P, a one-tonne six-seater medium duty version with the same 2R engine. Another update and facelift occurred in September 1967 with the introduction of the RK101. This also spelled the end of all 1.5-litre models for Japan, although they continued to be available in export markets. In some markets (e.g. North America) the Stout was replaced by the slightly smaller Hilux in 1969 but in many other markets (e.g. South-East Asia and Australia) it was sold alongside the Hilux as a heavier-duty alternative. The RK101 used the 1994 cc 5R engine.\\"Toyota Vehicle Identification Manual\\", Toyota Motor Corporation, Overseas Parts Department, Catalog No.97913-84, 1984, Japan Its in Japanese trim, combined with low gearing for higher load capacity, provided a top speed of only . In later versions higher compression meant that power increased to at 5200 rpm. The engine displacement remained under 2.0 litres so as to offer Japanese buyers some tax advantages when it came time to pay the Japanese annual road tax. The South African RK101 claimed SAE at 5200 rpm. Export models to DIN specifications claimed . An RK101 Stout in Bolivia Third generation (1979-1989) Facelifted and modernised in March 1979, the 1.5-ton Stout now used the front pressings of the smaller Hilux but still fulfilled the same role as before. The bed used the same pressings as for the previous Stouts, meaning that there was a pronounced difference between the front and rear bodywork. The RK110 also continued to use the same 1,994 cc 5R engine, although export versions were also available with the 2.2 litre 20R engine. The Stout underwent a light facelift in January 1982 and became the RK111. Body styles included a pickup (two-door, three-seater) and a double-cab pickup (four-door six-seater). The Stout was cancelled in 1989 without a successor, as Toyota's first full-size pickup, the T100 (as well as the later Tundra) were built mainly for North America, where the Stout had been replaced by the Hilux in 1968. In Japan, the third generation Stout saw very limited sales, as trucks in this weight class were nearly always of a cab-over design. Most third generation Stouts were exported. The double cab version was retired in July 1985.Toyota Stout RK110, 111 (parts catalog), p. 6 Stout production came to a final halt in March 1989, although there are indications that production continued until as late as 2000. These later versions (YK110) are supposed to have received the 4Y engine.

During the American Revolutionary War, the Continental Army destroyed it and nearby Unadilla in October 1778 in retaliation for British and Iroquois attacks on frontier communities. Population Onaquaga was originally home to members of the Oneida tribe, one of the Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy. The Iroquoian-speaking Tuscarora people joined in outlying settlements when they migrated north from South Carolina and became the Sixth Nation of the confederacy in 1722. In 1753, Nanticoke refugees from Virginia also moved into the village. That same year, Reverend Gideon Hawley established an Indian mission in the village. The establishment of the mission led to an increase in population of Christianized Indians living in and about the village, both those from the area and those who migrated from elsewhere (reference: Olde Ulster, volume 3, issue 11, page 323). Following the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, Mohawks were forced north and west and a number settled in Onaquaga, just west of the treaty line. They were prosperous, had some cattle and poultry, gardens, and fruit trees. Many of the inhabitants were Christians. By the time of the American Revolution, representatives from all of the Six Nations, a group of Algonquian-speaking Lenape people, and also a number of Loyalists lived in Onaquaga, a total population of about 400. In 1778 during the Revolution, Joseph Brant used Onaquaga as a base for raids on New York and Pennsylvania frontier communities. In retaliation the Americans organized a raid commanded by Lieutenant Colonel William Butler. Faced with superior forces the inhabitants abandoned the town, which was then burned by the Americans. Alternate spellings Historian Francis Whiting Halsey, who spelled the name of the village Oghwaga, included this footnote in his 1901 work The Old New York Frontier: :Spelled in almost every conceivable manner. Among the forms are Oneaquaga, Oughquagy, Onoaughquagey, Ononghquage, Auquauga, Anaquaga, Oughquogey, Anaquegha, Onaquaga, Aughquagee, Ochquaga, Aughquagey, Oquaca, Oguaga, Anaquaqua, Oquage, and Okwaha. The form Okwaho is used in the Marcoux Dictionary, which gives the meaning wolf. This was a term applied to one of the Mohawk tribes. Gideon Hawley wrote Onohoghquage. Dr. O‚ÄôCallaghan employed the form Oghquaga. For the present village in the town of Colesville, the spelling is Ouaquaga. A little further east in the Southern Tier of New York State, in Delaware County, the form Oquaga is used for a small lake, a waterway, the eponymous Oquaga Creek State Park, and a hotel in the town of Deposit. The northerly branch of the Delaware has been called the Coquago branch. Wilkinson wrote Oquago, and Washington Anaquaga. Stone adopted the form Oghkwaga. Sir William Johnson wrote Oghquago ‚Äì though not always. Joseph Brant, after the Battle of Minisink, used the form Oghwage. Brant was a Mohawk Indian who knew how to spell. The word is pronounced in three syllables. In order to secure such pronunciation the author has taken the liberty of converting Brant‚Äôs final \\"e\\" into an \\"a,\\" making it Oghwaga. A. Cusick told Dr. Beauchamp he thought the word meant place of hulled-corn soup.

Based on the novel written by Don Mankiewicz, it is about a Mexican boy accused of rape and murder; originally victimized by prejudiced accusers, he becomes a pawn of his communist defender, whose propaganda purposes would be best served by a verdict of guilty. Plot Angel Chavez (Rafael Campos) is a Mexican-American teenager who lives in the small California town of San Juno. During an annual event called Bass Night held at the town beach, he wanders onto the beach, off-limits to Mexican Americans. There he meets a non-Hispanic girl he knows from high school, but she has a weak heart due to rheumatic fever and dies suddenly, and Angel is arrested. On the grounds that her heart attack was caused by Angel's attempt to seduce her--which, as they were minors, would have been statutory rape even if consensual--he is charged with felony murder. A racist mob attempts to break Angel out of jail and lynch him, but the warden persuades them to stop by promising that the youth will be executed after a fair trial. David Blake (Glenn Ford) is a law professor at the state university. He is told he must stop teaching until he has had some courtroom experience. Rejected by many law firms, he finds work at a small one run by Barney Castle (Arthur Kennedy). Castle wants to defend Angel and agrees to hire Blake to handle the case. Castle and Angel's mother (Katy Jurado) travels to New York City to raise money to defend Angel. Castle leaves his law clerk Abbe Nyle (Dorothy McGuire) to help Blake, and they fall in love. Detectives working for Castle's firm uncover an attempt to tamper with the jury on behalf of the prosecution, but a new jury panel is called. Over a weekend break during jury selection, Castle calls Blake to New York to join him at a fundraising rally. Blake quickly realizes that Castle is primarily using the case as a propaganda and fundraising tool for a Communist group. Insulted at being used, Blake returns to San Juno to see the trial through to the end and represent Angel's interests. Blake's trial strategy is to rebut the prosecution's case sufficiently that he does not need to present a defense. However, at the last moment, Castle returns and, using his influence on Angel's mother, threatens Castle with removal unless Angel testifies. Blake realizes that Castle wants the teen subjected to a harsh cross-examination that will ensure his conviction and execution; he then will be a martyr, and Castle will be able to use the case as a fundraising tool for the Communist Party. Blake remains on the case, but the cross-examination goes as poorly as feared. Chavez is found guilty, and as the jury did not suggest leniency, the death penalty will be automatic. Castle then does have Blake fired to keep him from speaking during sentencing, but he arrives anyway and requests and receives amicus status. Blake now says that, because the charge of murder was based on a technicality, it is appropriate for the judge to apply another technicality, Chavez's status as a minor, in sentencing. Instead of being hanged, the boy can simply be sent to reform school. When the prosecutor agrees that this would be fair, the African-American judge (Juano Hernandez) accepts the suggestion. He then sentences Castle, who has tried to race-bait him during Blake's argument, to 30 days in jail for contempt. Blake and Abbe Nyle leave the court together.
