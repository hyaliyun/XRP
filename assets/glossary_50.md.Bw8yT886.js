In the 17th century Joachim Jung,Joachim Jung, Isagoge phytoscopica (1678) clearly articulated that plants are composed of different organ types such as root, stem and leaf, and he went on to define these organ types on the basis of form and position. In the following century Caspar Friedrich Wolff Caspar Friedrich Wolff, Theoria generationis (1759) was able to follow the development of organs from the \\"growing points\\" or apical meristems. He noted the commonality of development between foliage leaves and floral leaves (e.g. petals) and wrote: \\"In the whole plant, whose parts we wonder at as being, at the first glance, so extraordinarily diverse, I finally perceive and recognize nothing beyond leaves and stem (for the root may be regarded as a stem). Consequently all parts of the plant, except the stem, are modified leaves.\\" Similar views were propounded at by Goethe in his well-known treatise.J.W. Goethe, Versuch die Metamorphose der Pflanzen zu erklaren (1790) He wrote: \\"The underlying relationship between the various external parts of the plant, such as the leaves, the calyx, the corolla, the stamens, which develop one after the other and, as it were, out of one another, has long been generally recognized by investigators, and has in fact been specially studied; and the operation by which one and the same organ presents itself to us in various forms has been termed Metamorphosis of Plants.\\" See also * morphology (biology) ReferencesExternal links * Organography of plants, especially of the Archegoniata and Spermaphyta, by Dr. K.

George Bentham disagreed with Planchon's classification and so in 1864 he divided the genus into just two sections, with all tuberous species in sect. Ergaleium and those without tubers in sect. Rorella. Ludwig Diels reclassified the genus in his 1906 monograph of the family, recognizing subgenus Ergaleium and two sections within it: Erythrorhiza (Planchon) Diels and Polypeltes Diels. Another reclassification occurred in 1977, when Larry Eugene DeBuhr added section Stolonifera, which was based on Planchon's subseries Stoloniferae.

The active enzyme of the decapping complex is the bilobed Nudix family enzyme Dcp2, which hydrolyzes 5' cap and releases 7mGDP and a 5'-monophosphorylated mRNA. This decapped mRNA is inhibited for translation and will be degraded by exonucleases. The core decapping complex is conserved in eukaryotes. Dcp2 is activated by Decapping Protein 1 (Dcp1) and in higher eukaryotes joined by the scaffold protein VCS. Together with many other accessory proteins, the decapping complex assembles in P-bodies in the cytoplasm.

It is short for \\"gungjung yeogwan\\", which translates as \\"a lady officer of the royal court\\". Gungnyeo includes sanggung (palace matron) and nain (assistant court ladies), both of which hold rank as officers. The term is also used more broadly to encompass women in a lower class without a rank such as musuri (lowest maids in charge of odd chores), gaksimi, sonnim, uinyeo (female physicians) as well as nain and sanggung. The term spans those from courtiers to domestic workers.  Establishment  In the Dae Jang Geum theme park, a model of the royal kitchen in which gungnyeo worked is displayed. Although the first record of gungnyeo appears in Goryeosa, a compilation on the history of Goryeo, a provision was first made in 1392 by King Taejo per Jo Jun (Ë∂ôÊµö) and other officers' suggestions after the establishment of the Joseon Dynasty. In 1428 Sejong the Great set up a detailed system regulating gungnyeo, in which female officers were divided into naegwan (internal offices, concerned with the royal court) and gunggwan (palace officers), and defined their ranks, titles, and social status. He further institutionalized the system, with revisions, in the Gyeongguk daejeon (Complete Code of Laws). The gungnyeo were not clearly defined during the Goryeo period, and it is not known how they came to serve the court and what procedures applied to them. The use of the term during that period is therefore assumed to refer to all women in the king's service in the court. In documents related to Goryeo, the social status of gungnyeo was generally commoner or lower class, such as the daughters of slaves, concubines, or cheonmin (the despised). In the 22nd year of King Uijong gungnyeo roles were divided into sanggung (Â∞ôÂÆÆ, managing the palace), sangchim (Â∞ôÂØ¢, managing bedding), sangsik (Â∞ôÈ£ü managing food), and another type of sangchim (Â∞ôÈáù, managing sewing). Female musicians called yeoak were also a part of the gungnyeo. During the Joseon Dynasty, court life was centered on the King, so many court women were necessary. They were assigned to the Daejeon (Â§ßÊÆø; the Great Hall), Naejeon (ÂÖßÊÆø, private inner royal hall), the Daebijeon (the Queen dowager's quarter), or the Sejajeon (the crown prince's quarter) of the palace.  Election and education  Gyechuk ilgi, Diary of 1613 The appointment of gungnyeo usually occurred one year in ten, but there were exceptions; the method of appointing gungnyeo and their social status differed from time to time, so the process was not systematized. In general, gungnyeo were chosen from among female slaves who belonged to the governing class rather than from daughters of the sangmin (common people in rank). However, if circumstances allowed, people around the king wanted to pick gungnyeo from commoners' children, using a custom of early marriage in households that had a daughter over ten years old. As a result, since King Gyeongjong's reign, daughters from the lower class were prohibited to be appointed as gungnyeo. According to the Sokdaejeon (Supplement to the National Code), some female slaves of each government office were chosen to become gungnyeo since the reign of King Yeongjo. While this restriction on class applied to \\"common gungnyeo\\", the appointment of those in important roles, closely waiting on the king and queen, such as jimil nain, was different. The standard for choosing jimil nain was so high that sanggung tended to go out recruiting candidates through personal connections and by family custom. There were many gungnyeo in service who recommended their relatives for the position. The social status of the gungnyeo who were assigned to jimil, chimbang (the sewing department), and subang (the embroidery department) came from the jungin class (literally \\"middle class\\"); the others mostly came from \\"commoner's class\\". Common gungnyeo entered the palace at the age of twelve to thirteen, whereas jimil nain entered there at the age of four to eight, and nain for the sewing and embroidery departments began to serve the court at six to thirteen. Such \\"trainee gungnyeo\\" received the necessary education to become gungnyeo, such as learning court language, required daily conducts and behaviors, and writing gungche (palace-style font). Some gungnyeo left refined calligraphy works written in hangul (the Korean alphabet) with the gungche or Gyechuk ilgi (Diary of the Year Gyechuk, 1613) and Inhyeon wanghujeon (Tales of Queen Inhyeon), all of which are regarded as excellent examples of the \\"palace literature\\".  The types of gungnyeo = In the narrow meaning  Gungnyeo always distinguished themselves from the sanggung and nain because the role and social status of the groups were greatly different. The latter groups can be divided into three types; trainee nain, nain, and sanggung. They were treated differently according experience and length of service at court and in affiliated departments. Even the sanggung group was divided by rank according to their experience, and sanggung with the same rank did not always have the same social standing. Trainee nain referred to girls who had not yet passed the gwallye (ÂÜ†Á¶Æ, a coming-of-age ceremony), and they were divided into saenggaksi and gaksi. The term, saenggaksi derives from the fact that the girls had a hairstyle called saengmeori. Only three departments, jimil, chimbang, and subang had the saenggaksi. After 15 years service in the palace the trainee nain became an official nain. Nain wore a jade-colored dangui (a variety of jeogori, a short jacket) and a navy blue chima (a bulky skirt) and decorated their head with a frog-shaped cheopji (a hairpin).  In the broad meaning  Gaksimi is a generic term collectively referring to a housemaid, kitchen-maid, seamstress or others working at a sanggung's private residence on the sanggung's days off. Their monthly salary was paid by the state, so they were also called \\"bangja\\". The term bangja means a clerk working at a government office and is the same as the male character called bangja who appears in Chunhyangjeon (Story of Chunhyang). Musuri refers to women in charge of miscellaneous jobs (such as drawing water, making a fire, etc.) at every residence at court. Sonnim is a type of housemaid who took charge of housekeeping at the king's concubine's residence. They were generally related to the concubine's family, and their salary was paid from the concubine's living expenses. The term means a person from outside of the palace and is a courtesy title, unlike musuri and gaksimi. Uinyeo literally means \\"medicine women\\" and they usually treated gungnyeo with acupuncture and acted as midwife when the king's consort or concubine gave birth. Whenever a feast was held at court they transformed themselves into gisaeng (female entertainers). For such occasions, they wore wonsam (a female ceremonial garment), hwagwan (an elaborate coronet) on their head and colorfully striped hansam (fabric extensions on the sleeves of the costume) on their hands just like dancers, so they were also called yakbang gisaeng. Consequently, yakbang is another name for naeuiwon (royal health clinic). Although uinyeo's affiliation was to the naeuiwon, their predecessors were gisaeng. The uinyeo system was originally established during King Taejong's reign because sick consorts, concubines and gungnyeo preferred to die rather than to be seen by a male doctor, due to the strict naeoebeop (sex segregation), based on Confucianism, at that time. Slave girls who belonged to storage or government offices were therefore chosen to train in medical practices such as pulse-checking, acupuncture and others. Because they were originally uneducated cheonmin (the despised), the uinyeo system was not very fruitful. During King Yeonsangun's reign, whenever a feast was held at each government office, uinyeo were told to participate in it as gisaeng with makeup. The system lasted until the end of the dynasty and the number of uinyeo was about 80 during King Gojong's reign. The uinyeo system disappeared when Western doctors entered the court.  Gungnyeo's roles  In a reenactment of a royal wedding ceremony, two models acting as gungnyeo assist the model of the queen in the red robe. Gungnyeo can be described as a type of luxurious slaves for royal private life, needed in departments in charge of clothing, cooking and housing among others. Such places were jimil (\\"the innermost quarter\\", waiting closely on royalty), chimbang (the sewing department), subang (the embroidery department), two sojubang; naesojobang and oesojubang, one for preparing daily meals, another for preparing food for banquets, saenggwabang (the dessert department), and sedapbang (the laundry department). In addition to those seven departments, four other departments existed: sesugan (Ê¥óÊâãÈñì, the department in charge of the king and queen's washing and bathing), toeseongan (ÈÄÄËÜ≥Èñì; a food arrangement room), bogicheo (ÂÉï‰ºäËôï, the department for making fires), deungchokbang (ÁáàÁá≠Êàø the department for lanterns and candlelight). In terms of a more common individual's household jimil nain, who had the highest standing in gungnyeo society, acted like a personal maid to the mistress. Nain (assistant court ladies) at chimbang, and subang were like seamstresses while nain at sojubang and saenggwabang were like kitchen-maids. Sedapbang managed the laundry; in common families, female slaves generally did the cleaning, while experienced housewives ironed and smoothed laundry by pounding. Jimil nain had the highest social status while nain at chimbang, and subang were next in status. They could wear a chima (a bulky skirt) in the way which yangban women did, and were allowed as a privilege to let it down long without wearing an apron. Since they worked on a floor or in a room, these nain did not need to fold up their skirt, unlike nain at sojubang, and sedapbang. Nain at the other departments rolled up their skirt with an apron. Likewise, only the former three departments could have saenggaksi (ÏÉùÍ∞ÅÏãú, young nain with a hairstyle called \\"saeng\\" or \\"sayang\\"), while young nain at the others could not bind their hair with saeng but had to let it down in long braids.  Gungnyeo's rank  Gungnyeo society had supervisors who acted as the head of the gungnyeo group, and sanggung who received special treatment according to the importance of their job. Jejo sanggung (ÊèêË™øÂ∞ôÂÆÆ), also called Keunbang sanggung were senior among gungnyeo and received the king's orders and managed properties in the queen's quarter. They exercised political power at the time. Bujejo sanggung also called Arigo sanggung (ÈòøÈáåÂ∫´) took charge of items in stores attached to the queen's quarter. Jimil sanggung also called Daeryeong sanggung waited closely on the king. Bomo sanggung took charge of nursing princes or princesses, and among them those who served the crown prince had the highest standing among the group. Sinyeo sanggung were in charge of assisting the king, queen and queen dowager whenever a national ceremony or feast occurred. They also managed books and documents of the Jimil sanggung and did gokeup (mourning and crying loudly). Gamchal sanggung gave rewards or punishments to relevant gungnyeo, acting as a supervisors, and were held in awe by other gungnyeo. Some gungnyeo who were favoured by the king could take political power and improve their rank. Palace ladies were subordinate to the queen, and were ranked below the Royal Noble Consorts (ne-gwan ÎÇ¥Í¥Ä). The ranks for gungnyeo would could reach the 5th rank at the highest, but typically started much lower in the 9th rank. There were 5 ranks for palace ladies with two levels each. *special-Royal Sanggung (ÏäπÏùÄÏÉÅÍ∂Å) was a special sanggung with the love of the king. She could become a royal concubine if the king appoints her as a royal concubine. *Fifth rank upper - Head lady (jejo sang-gung Ï†úÏ°∞ÏÉÅÍ∂Å) was a palace lady who served the king directly. The appointment decree was issued by the king. * Fifth rank lower - First Palace Lady (leading the Royal/Queen's Secretariat): Sang-bok (ÏÉÅÎ≥µ) and Sang-shik (ÏÉÅÏãù) * Sixth rank upper - Chief Palace Lady (e.g. leading the royal kitchen): Sang-chim (ÏÉÅÏπ®) and Sang-gong (ÏÉÅÍ≥µ) * Sixth rank lower - Sang-jeong (ÏÉÅÏ†ï) and Sang-gi (ÏÉÅÍ∏∞) * Seventh rank upper - Leading Palace Lady (being charge of a specific activity): Chon-bin (Ï†ÑÎπà), Chon-ui (Ï†ÑÏùò) and Chon-son (Ï†ÑÏÑ†) * Seventh rank lower - Jeon-seol (Ï†ÑÏÑ§), Jeon-je (Ï†ÑÏ†ú) and Jeon-eon (Ï†ÑÏñ∏) * Eighth rank upper - Jeon-chan (Ï†ÑÏ∞¨), Jeon-shik (Ï†ÑÏãù) and Jeon-yak (Ï†ÑÏïΩ) * Eighth rank lower - Jeon-deung (Ï†ÑÎì±), Jeon-che (Ï†ÑÏ±Ñ) and Jeon-jeong (Ï†ÑÏ†ï) * Ninth rank upper - Ju-gung (Ï£ºÍ∂Å), Ju-sang (Ï£ºÏÉÅ) and Ju-gak (Ï£ºÍ∞Å) * Ninth rank lower - Ju-byeon-chi (Ï£ºÎ≥ÄÏπò), ju-chi (Ï£ºÏπò), ju-oo (Ï£ºÏö∞) and Ju-byeon-gung (Ï£ºÎ≥ÄÍ∂Å) The palace ladies were followed by lower rank ladies-in-waiting (e.g. palace lady candidates), servants and slaves.  The number of gungnyeo  The total number of gungnyeo included not only gungnyeo at the main palace where the king resided but also at Jesagung, palaces for jesa, (ancestor veneration) and Byeolgung, (annexed palaces). Gungnyeo who worked within the main palace despised those who worked in annexed palaces, calling them gunggeot (the one at the palace). In the main palace, the king's quarter was managed as an independent household, and all of the king, queen, queen dowager's quarters had the same number of gungnyeo. It has been suggested that gungnyeo numbered 90 in total. Each of these residences would have twenty to twenty seven jimil nain and the other places would have fifteen to twenty. The total number differed from time and was increased or decreased depending on circumstances at court. While the number of gungnyeo in the early period of the Joseon Dynasty was not great, it tended to increase as time went by. During King Seongjong's reign (1469‚Äì1494), 105 gungnyeo in total served the palace, with 29 for the mother of the previous king, 27 for the queen dowager's quarter and 49 for the king's quarter. During the reign of King Gojong (1863‚Äì1907), the total number of gungnyeo reached 480; 100 for the king's quarter, 100 for the queen dowager's quarter, 100 for the queen, 60 for the crown prince, 40 for the consort of the heir apparent, 50 for the seson, the son of the prince successor, and 30 for the wife of the seson.  Lifetime employment and payment  All gungnyeo within the palace were basically tied for life, from their acceptance into the palace until the time at which they had to leave. Once they entered service they had to live inside the palace for their whole life, except for special occasions. Apart from the king and his immediate household, nobody, not even his concubines, could die in the royal court, so when gungnyeo became old or ill, they had to leave the palace. There were other reasons to release gungnyeo from the palace, such as when their superior or master was ill, or when a drought happened, a certain number of gungnyeo were released in appeasement of the natural calamity. In the latter case, such released gungnyeo were restricted in their actions, prohibited from marrying, and would be harshly punished if they violated these rules. Thus gungnyeo lived completely isolated from outside life, and were not allowed to contact men, or even other women, except by release from service. The life of gungnyeo is depicted in an ancient novel titled Unyeongjeon (Èõ≤Ëã±ÂÇ≥) written by an anonymous writer during the Joseon Dynasty. Gungnyeo received a graded monthly salary according to rank and living necessities as their payment, but the price was not fixed. It varied according to economic circumstances at that time. Service was assumed to be on a day-shift basis.

Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 1987 Early years Beals was born in Medicine Lodge, Kansas. His father, Leon Eli Beals (1864‚Äì1941), lawyer and journalist, was the stepson of Carrie Nation, the temperance movement advocate. His mother was Elvina Sybilla Blickensderfer (1867‚Äì?). His brother, Ralph Leon Beals (1901‚Äì85), was the first anthropologist at University of California, Los Angeles. The family moved from Kansas when Beals was age three, and he attended school in Pasadena, California. After graduating from high school in 1911, he worked a variety of jobs while attending the University of California, Berkeley where he studied engineering and mining. He won the Bonnheim Essay Prize and the Bryce History Essay Prize. After graduating cum laude, he attended Columbia University on a graduate scholarship, earning a master's degree in 1917. Career Unable to find work as a writer, Beals took a job with Standard Oil Company, but it did not suit him. In 1918, he spent a brief period of time in jail as a World War I draft evader. Upon release, he decided to go see the world, and with what little money he had, Beals and his wife Lillian drove to Mexico. There, he founded the English Preparatory Institute, and taught at the American High School. They left Mexico in 1921 for Europe where Beals studied at the University of Madrid, and then the University of Rome. Back in Mexico, he became a correspondent for The Nation, separated from his wife, and became romantically involved with photographer Tina Modotti's sister, Mercedes. In February 1928, Oswald Garrison Villard, editor of The Nation, sent Beals to Nicaragua to write a series of articles. He became notable as the only foreign journalist who interviewed General Augusto Sandino during Nicaragua's 1927‚Äì33 war against US military occupation. In all, Beals wrote over 200 magazine articles for publications such as the New Republic and Harper's Magazine. Beals also wrote more than 45 books, including on history, geography, and travel. Some of his books are written for a juvenile audience.Applegate, p. 22. His autobiography, Glass Houses, was published by J.B. Lippincott Company in 1938. In 1931, Beals was awarded the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship for biographies. His biography subjects included Porfirio D√≠az, Huey P. Long, Roberto de la Selva, Stephen F. Austin, John Eliot, Carrie Nation, and Leon Trotsky. During his career, Beals witnessed Mexican revolutions, lectured on Shakespeare, and was held incommunicado by a Mexican general. His travels took him to French Morocco, Tunisia, Algiers, Greece, Turkey, the Soviet Union, Germany, and the Caribbean. He was a Ford Hall Forum speaker in 1936, and a member of the American Committee for the Defense of Leon Trotsky in 1937. The following year, Time Magazine called Beals, \\"the best informed and the most awkward living writer on Latin America.\\" Later years During the 1960s, he supported the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. Beals was a hero to the young people of Cuba.Applegate, p. 22 In his later years, Beals lived on Fire Tower Road in Killingworth, Connecticut. He is buried in Killingworth's Evergreen Cemetery.

It, along with the Hanson Formation and the Snow Hill Island Formation, are the only formations yet known on the continent where dinosaur fossils have been found. The formation outcrops on James Ross Island off the coast of the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. In its entirety, the Santa Marta Formation is on average one kilometer thick.  Stratigraphy  The Santa Marta Formation was deposited during the Santonian and Campanian ages of the Late Cretaceous. It overlies the Gustav Group laid down during the Barremian and Santonian ages and is succeeded by the Snow Hill Island Formation of late Campanian age. Together, the Santa Marta Formation, Snow Hill Island Formation, the overlying L√≥pez de Bertodano Formation (deposited from the late Campanian age of the Late Cretaceous to the early Paleocene epoch of the early Paleogene), and the Sobral Formation (deposited during the early Paleocene) form the Marambio Group. Originally, the formation was subdivided into three informal members termed the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma members. The names were later changed to the Lachman Crags, Herbert Sound, and Rabot members. The Lachman Crags and Herbert Sound members, named after the areas in which they outcrop, are found in the northern part of James Ross Island. Both members are late Campanian in age. The Lachman Crags Member, the older of the two, is around 500 meters thick. The lower section of the member consists of tuffaceous mudstone while the upper section consists of tuffaceous turbidites formed by underwater avalanches. Bioturbation is evident in tuff beds throughout the member due to the disruption of sediments by benthic life during the time of deposition. The Herbert Sound member is also around 500 meters thick and also can be divided into two distinct sections. Channeled debris flows interbedded with turbides make up the lower portion of the member and are overlain by fine sandstones (followed by coarser sandstones and coquinas) that make up the upper portion of the member. The depositional environment is thought to have been a system of abyssal fans radiating out from a large river delta. The rapid aggradation of sediments from the delta produced a steep delta slope, which may have resulted in occasional debris flows that formed the turbides. A high degree of tectonic activity in the region at the time may explain the intermittent tuff beds throughout the formation. The Rabot Member of the Santa Marta Formation is confined to the southeastern part of James Ross Island and dates back to the early to late Campanian. Outcroppings of the member are separated from those of other members in the northern part of the island. Originally the member was regarded as its own formation, and now it is considered to be the lateral equivalent of both the Lachman Crags and Herbert Sound members. Like the Lachman Crags and Herbert Sound members, the Rabot member consists of mudstones and beds of tuff that are often highly bioturbated, and also consists of rare conglomerates. Recently a fourth member has been assigned to the formation called the Hamilton Point Member. The beds of this member used to be considered part of the upper portion of the Rabot member, but now are considered to be their own distinct member.  Flora and fauna  A wide variety of microorganisms inhabited the coastal waters at the time of the deposition of the Santa Marta Formation. Microfossils include ostracods and dinoflagellates. Invertebrates were also common. Fossils of ammonites can be found in the formation, often embedded vertically in the bedding plane. Originally it was thought that dead ammonites could only be oriented this way in sediment if they were in shallow waters below a certain pressure, but there is evidence to support that due to specific conditions during burial, it was possible for these ammonites to be vertically oriented at greater depths. Ammonite genera present in the formation include Anagaudryceras, Anapachydiscus, Eupachydiscus, Gaudryceras, Maorites, Natalites, Parasolenoceras, Yezoites, and the heteromorph ammonites Ainoceras, Eubostrychoceras, Ryugasella and Baculites. Many bivalve fossils have been found such as Cucullaea, Panopea, Pinna, and Pterotrigonia. Polychaete annelid worms such as Rotularia and gastropods such as the cerithiid sea snail Cerithium have also been discovered in beds within the formation. Numerous ichnofossils provide evidence of benthic activity, along with the bioturbated sediments previously mentioned. Vertical spreite trace fossils have been found as part of fodinichnia dominated ichnocoenosis and were assigned to ichnogenre such as Paradictyodora. Trackways thought to belong to decapods have also been found. Taniwhasaurus Fish were present, including one of the first frilled sharks, Chlamydoselachus thomsoni. Other marine vertebrates included the small mosasaur Taniwhasaurus antarcticus, previously known as Lakumasaurus antarcticus. The close relation of T. antarcticus to other species of Taniwhasaurus found in New Zealand and Patagonia provides evidence for a Gondwanan endemism. Antarctopelta oliveroi, an ankylosaur, was discovered in 1986 on the northern part of James Ross Island about 2 kilometers south of Santa Marta Cove in beds that were part of the Santa Marta Formation.Olivero E. B., Gasparini Z., Rinaldi C. A. and Scasso R. (1991) First record of dinosaurs in Antarctica (Upper Cretaceous, James Ross Island): paleogeographical implications, in Thomson M. R. A., Crame J. A. and Thomson J. W. (eds), Geological Evolution of Antarctica. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge: 617-622. It was the first dinosaur found in Antarctica. It may be a possible nodosaur but there has been no formal phylogenic analysis to prove its relationship with other ankylosaurs. Although the formation is made up of only marine deposits, the bodies of these animals along with other debris may have frequently been washed out to sea to later sink to the bottom and be buried by sediment. Leaves and fragments of plants are commonly found as fossils throughout the formation as well as large tree trunks in the lower members. This is evidence of the forested environment that covered Antarctica during the Late Cretaceous due to the overall warmer global temperature and milder climate. At that time the river delta had much vegetation, and was able to support large herbivores such as Antarctopelta.

A former politics lecturer at Monash University, Teichmann was known for his independent views and trenchant criticisms of both the Left and the Right.  Early years  Born in Melbourne to a German-born father, also Max, and an Adelaide-born mother, Kathleen, Teichmann grew up in the working-class suburb of Carlton during the Great Depression. After leaving school, he worked as a junior journalist, then in 1942 joined the Australian army and saw action in Papua New Guinea. Education After the war, as an ex-serviceman, he enrolled in the University of Melbourne where he embarked on an academic career. He won a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, United Kingdom where he was taught by Isaiah Berlin, Max Beloff and John Plamenatz. While in the United Kingdom, Teichmann became involved in left-wing politics, joining Britain's Labour Party and Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. He married the philosopher Jenny Teichman. Political commentary In 1964, he returned to Australia and took up a post in the department of politics at Monash University. He became active in the anti-Vietnam War movement in Australia and counted among his friends leading Australian Labor Party identities such as Jim Cairns and Bill Hayden. Teichmann eventually did adopt more conservative views and he became a fierce critic of the Left in Australia. Writing in the Australian Financial Review on 19 July 1999, Christopher Pearson listed Teichmann as one of several contemporary Australian political commentators who had commenced on the Left but had become conservatives later on in their careers. Pearson asserted that \\"Teichmann's position evolved primarily in response to the Left\\". So much so that his \\"critique of parasitism in the institutional Left, old and new, made him a heretical presence at Monash\\". Columnist Teichmann retired from Monash in 1989. He went on to work as a regular columnist with The Adelaide Review from the mid-1990s until 2002.

He initiated and illustrated Nirguna (absolute) Bhakti, although he was not against Saguna Bhakti. He initiated and tried to eliminate \\"show\\", blind faith, hypocrisy and misled existing in the Hindu Religion and preferred to worship the 'name of God', Rama, over God, to not get involved in false \\"show\\" activities. Early life Birth Place of Ram Charan Maharaj in Sodha Ram Charan was born in Sodha, a village in the Tonk district of Rajasthan on 24 February 1720 (MƒÅgh Shukla 14 in Bikram Samwat 1776). His father's name was Bakhat Ram Vijayvergia and his mother's name was Devhuti Devi. His parents lived in Banwara village near Malpura, Rajasthan. Charan's childhood name was \\"Ram Kishan\\". Charan married Gulab Kanwar and became Patwari after marriage. After some time the king of Jaipur (Amber, India) Jai Singh II of Amber offered him the post of Divan of Jaipur of Malpura branch. Spiritual life Ram Charan began to lose interest in materialism after his father's death in 1743 AD. One day he found out about the forecast of Bhringi Saint about his destiny. On that same night he dreamt that a saint saved him from drowning in a river.Page 324, Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency, Ahmedabad Government Central Press 1879 https://archive.org/stream/gazetteerbombay18enthgoog#page/n346/mode/2up The next day, he got permission from his family indirectly to leave home forever and began his quest to know God and find a perfect spiritual Guru in 1808 Bikram Samwat. Some believed that he left his house leaving his wife and a daughter behind. Picture of oldest version of \\"Anubhav Vaani\\", the collection of works composed by Ram Charan Maharaj. It originally belonged to Saroopabai, the daughter of NavalRamji. It is handwritten and illustrated. About 200 years old, now kept at Shahpura Ramdwara. He started travelling southwards, asking people about the saint he saw in his dream, explaining what the saint would look like. Finally, he found the saint \\"Kripa Ram\\" in Dantra village near Shahpura in Bhilwara district of Rajasthan. He became a disciple of Kripa Ram Maharaj and followed him. For nine years of tapasya he lived under the command of saint Kripa Ram. Kripa Ram was a disciple of Sant Das. During those nine years, Ram Charan performed many miracles which are still well known among the local people and \\"Ram Snehi Samprday\\". He also became very popular for his unique nirguna Bhakti. He visited many places, explaining his experience and advising people to eliminate \\"show\\", blind faith, hypocrisy and misleading teachings in the Hindu religion. He came to Bhilwara in 1817 (Bikram Samwat)and selected one lonely place named Miya Chand's bawri ( Step Well) for tapasya. By this time, he had reached the extreme level of Tapasya and reaching on the way to Nirvana.  Philosophy  Ram dhun- Evening chanting of Ram Ram at Ramdwara Shahpura, the main centre of Ramsnehi Sampradaya. Ram Charan advocated saying Raam Raam () as the way of reaching the ultimate. He preached selfless devotion as a means to realise God. He promoted Bhakti in general, trying to eliminate conflicts between Saguna and Nirguna types. Vaani Ji, the collection of works composed by him, focuses on knowledge, devotion and detachment. The spiritual master, Guru has been given the highest status by Swamiji in his own life, as is said in his shlokas. Often, the Guru is equated with 'Raam'. The student or seeker is told to avoid reading huge texts and instead focus on chanting Raam Raam as the simplest means to self- realization. The supreme being is present everywhere, in every living being. Swamiji followed the Vishishtadvaita school of thoughts. Non violence to any living being, including insects is a central tenet. The Bhagvatam is referred to most frequently, compared to other ancient Indian texts.  Social Reform  Ram Charan was against blind idolatry, which was prevalent during his time. His philosophy was that we must love God, and not merely create a show. He taught people to treat people equally, a king as well as a poor person. Also, he said that we must not discriminate on the basis caste or creed. Guru \\"Kripa Ram Ji\\" Sitting on floor and Guru of Kripa Ram ji \\"Santdas Ji\\" (Sitting on chair) RamCharan Ji Maharaj also emphasised that instead of going to various places and searching for God, one must look inside oneself. Following Maharaj Ji, it is only necessary to engage in spiritual practices, at one's own place, with proper and essential guidance of one's Guru.  Death  Ram Charan died in 1799 (Vaisakha Krishna 5 in Bikram Samwat 1855).  Works  Picture of latest version of \\"Anubhav Vaani\\", the collection of works composed by Ram Charan Maharaj. Granth Chintamani - From \\"Anubhav Vaani\\" of Swami Ji Shri Ram Charan Ji Maharaj, Founder Acharya, Ramsnehi Sampradaya. This has been recorded at Ramdwara Shahpura, district Bhilwara, Rajasthan Swami Ram Charan Ji's works are collected in 'Vaani Ji'(‡§µ‡§æ‡§£‡•Ä ‡§ú‡•Ä) consisting of 36250 compositions. Each of these was spoken by him to his disciples. The first 8,000 were noted by his disciple from Bhilwara, Naval Ram Ji. His collection in \\"Anubhav Vaani\\" is considered to be biggest religious book written on the teaching of any saint. The remaining ones were noted, collected and edited by his disciple Ram Jan Ji Maharaj (who also succeeded him as the head of the 'Ramsnehi Sampradaya' after his death). In Bikram Samwat 1981 (1925 CE), the complete Vaani Ji was published for the first time under the title :'Swami Ji Ram Charan Ji Maharaj ki Anubhav Vaani', from Shahpura. The latest edition has been published by Ram Niwas Dham, Shahpura (Bhilwara), in 2005 CE. Since this compilation, due to its large size, was found to be difficult for an individual to use, various smaller one were released, with at least one being published, by Sant LakshyaRam in Bikram Samwat 2015, on Vijayadashami day, from 'Chhatribagh' Ramdwara at Indore as 'Ram Rahasya Darshan'. Vaani Ji contains Swamiji's teachings in the form of poetry of various types(metres). There are also 'Bhajans' with indications of the Raaga which should be preferably used for them.  Formation of Ramsnehi Sampradaya  In the same year (1817 Bikram Samwat), disciple Ram Jan Ji of Ram Charan Maharaj formed \\"Ram Snehi Sampradaya\\" ( Ram Snehi Spiritual Tradition). This is the room where original Speech (Anubhav Vaani) is placed. The place of worship of believers of Swamiji is called a Ramdwara. Since Swamiji's times, the organisation has headquarters at Shahpura in Bhilwara district of Rajasthan. The Ramsnehi Sampradaya is currently led by Swami Ji Shri Ram Dayal Ji Maharaj.

The Communist Marshal Peng Dehuai was a Kuomintang Colonel in 1928, when he was stationed in Pingjiang with orders to eliminate local groups of communist guerrillas who had fled to the area following Chiang Kai-shek's nationwide suppression of Communists. Because Peng had secretly joined the Chinese Communist Party he instead kept his unit passive and began to organize local Communist Party branches.

Retrieved 2009-02-01 It is being built by the Haut Commissariat √† l'Am√©nagement de la Vall√©e du Niger (High Commission for Niger Valley), a public body under the Primer Minister's Office. The dam will generate hydropower and is control the flow of the Niger River, holding water during the dry season to maintain a minimum flow and making downstream irrigation possible. The project is formally named the Kandadji Programme for Ecosystem Regeneration and Niger River Development (Programme Kandadji de R√©g√©n√©ration des Ecosyst√®mes et de Mise en Valeur du Fleuve Niger).  History  The project was first proposed in the 1970s, when a larger dam had been considered. In 1998 the African Development Bank approved funding for a feasibility study that was conducted by the German consulting firm Lahmeyer. Under the study, an environmental and social diagnosis and an initial environmental and social assessment were conducted. The findings were presented in 2002. In August 2002 the government decided by Decree to go ahead with the project, which was from that time called the Kandadji Ecosystems Regeneration and Niger Valley Development Programme. Subsequently, a detailed assessment of environmental and social impact, including a Population Resettlement Plan and a Local Development Plan, was conducted. The Local Development Plan was designed to facilitate the economic transition of displaced persons in order to restore their standard of living or even enhance it, beyond mere resettlement. The final design of the dam was prepared with financing from the Islamic Development Bank, and that of a irrigation project with financing from the West African Development Bank.Republic of Niger, Prime Minister‚Äôs Office, High Commission for Niger Valley / African Development Bank:\\"KANDADJI\\" ECOSYSTEMS REGENERATION AND NIGER VALLEY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME (KERNVDP), DETAILED POPULATION RESETTLEMENT PLAN, EXECUTIVE SUMMARY, February 2008, p. 1-2 In 2005 and 2006 consultations were undertaken as part of the environmental and social assessment, which included participants from the World Wide Fund for Nature and International Union for Conservation of Nature.Republic of Niger, Prime Minister‚Äôs Office, High Commission for Niger Valley / African Development Bank:\\"KANDADJI\\" ECOSYSTEMS REGENERATION AND NIGER VALLEY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME (KERNVDP), DETAILED ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT, EXECUTIVE SUMMARY, January 2008, p. 12 According to one source, construction of the dam was begun in August 2008.

According to the Prime Minister at the time of initiating construction, Seyni Oumarou, \\"no other development project will have sparked so much long term interest or such high expectations\\". The expected benefits include increased agricultural production and hydropower generation. Niger imports almost half of its electricity consumption of (2007) from neighboring Nigeria, which itself suffers frequent power cuts.

Financing for the hydropower station itself is due to come from a public-private partnership.  Environmental, social and downstream impact  Negative social impacts include the resettlement of almost 35,000 people from 15 villages, loss of infrastructure (a national road, boreholes, clinics, schools, mosques, slaughterhouses, markets and grain mills) and loss of about 7,000 ha of agricultural land. According to a 2007 report by UNEP's Dams and Development Project, which itself was a follow-up activity to a report by the World Commission on Dams, the Kandadji project \\"serves as a useful example of the projection and estimation of social effects, which appears to have been widely encompassing, covering both negative impacts and benefits\\".

According to local historian Jaya Shivahang (‡§ú‡§Ø ‡§∂‡§ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§π‡§æ‡§ô‡•ç‡§ó), there used to be 12 different villages of Mangphang Rais in this region. When they had to demarcate their borderline to each other they called it Aamchak (‡§Ü‡§Æ‡§ö‡§ï) in Bantawa language meaning (next to you or your area). That's how the Aamchok (‡§Ü‡§Æ‡§ö‡•ã‡§ï) got its name. Balankha name also derives from local Bantawa language \\"Bhaglaamkha\\" (‡§≠‡§æ‡§ï‡§≤‡§æ‡§Æ‡•ç‡§ñ‡§æ). If we break it down, the word \\"Bhaak\\" (‡§≠‡§æ‡§ï) means \\"pig\\" and Laamma\\" (‡§≤‡§æ‡§Æ‡§Æ‡§æ) means \\"to search\\" and \\"khaa\\" (‡§ñ‡§æ) means \\"place\\". So it is the place where the pig was searched. According to local legend, once upon a time this area was covered with thick jungle, and Kirat ancestors Namnu and Hangkhim chased and searched their pigs in this place. So this place was called Bhaaklaamkhaa and over the time the pronunciation changed to Balankha. Police post  Local story of Shimbha Mala  There was a Kirati Chamling King known as Shimbha Mala (‡§∂‡§ø‡§Æ‡•ç‡§≠‡§æ ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§≤‡§æ) in Chamlung (‡§ö‡§æ‡§Æ‡§≤‡•Å‡§Ç‡§ó) village near Bopung. He was very powerful and very protective of this area. When King Prithbi Narayan Shah's forces were advancing towards eastern Nepal, he did not want to give up his territory easily. Back in those days, Chandi Danda (‡§ö‡§£‡•ç‡§°‡•Ä ‡§°‡§æ‡§Ç‡§°‡§æ) was the main gateway to this area and it was covered with thick jungle. Shimbha Mala and his few warriors armed with bows and arrows fought against Prithvi Narayan's soldiers and tried to stop them here. He and his warriors used to hide in the trees and attack their enemies with their arrows. They had little success in the beginning, but later, Prithbi Narayan's forces overpowered and killed him. They buried him along with his horse at the Chandi Danda. The grave still remains in the area but not many people know about it. Shimbha Mala's grave in Chandi Bazar The local Kirat Rais believe that the ghost of Shimbha Mala still roams in the area especially in the nights on nights with a full moon, a new moon and during kirat festivals. It is also believed that anyone who digs up the grave will die. A long time ago, the ghost phenomena used to occur every night. People could hear the horse steps and the sound of bells while the ghost was on the ride from Purne Dada (‡§™‡•Å‡§∞‡•ç‡§£‡•á ‡§°‡§æ‡§Ç‡§°‡§æ) to Raake Dada (‡§∞‡§æ‡§Å‡§ï‡•á ‡§°‡§æ‡§Ç‡§°‡§æ). People were scared to take a walk along the Mulbato (‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§≤‡§¨‡§æ‡§ü‡•ã) at late night for fear of seeing the ghost. A local Chhetri man named Kaale Bista (‡§ï‡§æ‡§≤‡•á ‡§¨‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü) who lived near the main trail Mulbato was tired of the ghost phenomena every night. One night he was determined to face the ghost directly. He took a big sword KaTTi (‡§ï‡§ü‡•ç‡§ü‡•Ä) in his hand and waited for the ghost. When the ghost arrived on the horse they faced each other. There was no words for few seconds, and all of a sudden, Kale Bista raised his weapon to attack the ghost, and thusly, the ghost became nervous and started to run away. Kale Bista chased the ghost few hundred yards away. Since then the Ghost has never appeared again in his area of Balankha. The great grandson of Kale Bista, Gadul Bista (‡§ó‡§°‡•Å‡§≤ ‡§¨‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü ) who died in 2065 B.S. used to tell this story to the locals.  Chandi Bazar  A long time ago, during Panchayat system, Chandi Bazar village was the official name for this area, to include Thindingkha village. Later on, local administrative map was redesigned. After the restructruction of administrative areas, Chandi Bazar was partitioned into Thidingkha Village Panchayat and Balankha Village Panchayat. However, some older people still call it Amchok Balankha too because Aamchok is the Rana era or early Panchayat era local body name and it consisted the whole south west area of Bhojpur. The new federal government revived the old glory of Amchok by naming the new local body 'Amchok rural municipality'. Culture and society Balankha is blend of various castes and ethnic groups. The majority are Kirat Rais but there are Kshetri, Bahun, Kami, Damai, Tamang, Sarki, etc. who have been living in harmony for ages. Kirat Rai Ubhauli festival at Chandi Bazar Chhongkha Sakenwa (‡§õ‡•ã‡§ô‡•ç‡§ñ‡§æ ‡§∏‡§æ‡§ï‡•á‡§®‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ) This is an important part of the cultural tradition of Kirat Rai people in this region. It is one of the most famous places to celebrate Kirat Rai's Sakela or Sakenwa festival. According to Kirat Rai historians, writers (Bam Bahadur Rai, Shyam Raj Rai and bulletins of Kirat Rai Yayokkhaa) and local people, it is about a 600-year-old tradition. The main ritual place is across the Buwa Khola (‡§¨‡•Å‡§Ç‡§µ‡§æ ‡§ñ‡•ã‡§≤‡§æ). It is called Chandi Than (‡§ö‡§®‡•ç‡§°‡•Ä ‡§•‡§æ‡§®). In every Ubhauli (‡§â‡§≠‡•å‡§≤‡•Ä) festival, a designated Kirat Rai priest called Nakchhong (‡§®‡§æ‡§ï‡§õ‡•ã‡§ô) performs puja and prays to the Kirat Rai ancestors for rain, good crops, good health of the people and livestock and continuity of this great Creation. There are certain processes to perform the ritual, and all Kirat Rais have to follow it properly. After the ritual is done, they come to Chandi danda or Chandi bazar (‡§ö‡§®‡•ç‡§°‡•Ä ‡§¨‡§ú‡§æ‡§∞), an open space near Balankha bazaar. They dance Sakewa dance with Dhol(‡§¢‡•ã‡§≤) and jhyamta (‡§ù‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Æ‡•ç‡§ü‡§æ). The dance style is a little different than other Sakewa dances seen in northern Bhojpur and neighboring Khotang district. Here, the rhythm is very slow, as are the dance movements themselves. Others might find the dance less interesting because it has more singing and less dance steps. Most of the Kirat Rais in the southern belt like Hatuwa, Ranibas, Basikhora, Pawala, Khairang, Chhongkha, and so on have similar dance style of Sakenwa. Beside Kirat Rai, there is a tradition of Bhote ko Mane (‡§≠‡•ã‡§ü‡•á‡§ï‡•ã ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡•á) from Tamang culture. There are a significant number of Tamang people in Balankha. Mane is a kind of stupa they build in memory of their deceased. There used to be a lot of Mane alongside of the mulbato (main trail to Bhojpur), especially in Tinchule jungle, Pasal Bhanjyang, Raake Bazar. The tradition seems to be disappearing slowly. New Mane (‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡•á) are rarely seen anymore. The old ones were all destroyed by treasure hunters almost two decades ago. Bar Pipal, Chautari, Kuwa are the traditional landmarks in the area. Old Chautaris with beautiful inscriptions etched in stone slates in memory of deceased souls are still found. With old Bar (‡§µ‡§∞) and Pipal (‡§™‡§ø‡§™‡§≤) trees side by side and wooden Bench ‚ÄúFalaicha‚Äù (‡§´‡§≤‡•à‡§Ç‡§ö‡§æ), a weary traveler could rest in comfort. Dashain and Tihar festivals as celebrated as it has national significance. Beside that Kirat Rai's \\"Udhauli\\" and \\"Ubhauli\\" are two main festivals celebrated with great joy by whole region. Education= Chandeswor Ma. Vi (Grade 1- 10)  Chandeswor High School playground Balankha's high school began in 2039 BS. The late King Birendra granted permission to establish Chandeswor High School during his visit to Ghoretar. This was the only High School in the whole Southwest region of Bhojpur and played a vital role to educate local population. Now more than 100 students participate in the SLC exam every year. Later other high schools in neighboring VDCs, e.g. Dummana and Wasing Tharpu were also established. The passing records of the students in SLC is significantly low and has often been questioned about its performance. The SLC result of 2069 (2012) is about 13%. Out of 77 only 10 students succeeded SLC exam. 3 of them were able to secure first division. One time the Highschool was assigned as SLC Center, but later removed, due to the fact that it poorly conducted the exam and the cheating was uncontrolled. Chandeswor Highschool  Chandeswor Uchcha Ma Vi (+2) ‡§ö‡§®‡•ç‡§°‡•á‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡•ã‡§∞ ‡§â‡§ö‡•ç‡§ö ‡§Æ‡§æ. ‡§µ‡§ø. ‡•®‡•¶‡•¨‡•¨  Chadeswor Uchha Ma Vi Signboard Chandeswor High School got approved for a +2 higher education system in 2066 B.S. With its establishment, students from seven other neighboring VDCs will have opportunity to complete their +2 degree in the local level. It has given boost to the educational development in this region. Rabin Rai - Founding Chairman of School The former Chairman of School Management Board Rabin Rai, initiated the establishment of +2 school. He conducted meetings with local leaders, teachers, students, and made a common agenda for the school. He took the matter not only to the district level officials, but even to the central level in Kathmandu and gave the agenda to the Nepal government's Higher Education Council. He was able to justify the necessity of +2 school to the officials. Finally the school got approval to run the +2 classes. He quickly managed to find teachers and start the first badge of 11th grade in Balankha in 2066 B.S. Since then the new +2 school has played a key role in the region. It is running an education faculty with students of about 100 (both 11th and 12th grades) and four teachers. The principal of the institute is Ram Prasad Kafle. Chandeswor Uchcha Ma Vi set the record among its peers in Bhojpur district in 11th grade examination of 2067 B.S. Out of 85 examinees 27 students passed the exam. This is merely 33% of the total but it is the highest percentage overall in Bhojpur district. Kapil Guragain (‡§ï‡§™‡•Ä‡§≤ ‡§ó‡•Å‡§∞‡§æ‡§ó‡§æ‡§á) is the current Principal and Headmaster of the Chandeswor High School. The school board is chaired by Katak Bista (‡§ï‡§ü‡§ï ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü). Politics= Present  Local Election of 2017 elected Ashok Rai as new Chairman of Amchok municipality. He belongs to NCP Maoist Kendra. Now there is new government officer appointed to support the elected body. Previously the secretary of the Village Development Committee used to run the day-to-day administrative tasks. For security reason, the secretary used to work at District Headquarters Bhojpur. The active political parties in this village town are Nepali Congress, CPN-UML, UCPN(M) and Rastriya Prajatantra Party. Sherdhan Rai (‡§∂‡•á‡§∞‡§ß‡§® ‡§∞‡§æ‡§à), Current Chief Minister for Pradesh 1 and Former Minister for Communication  After the 2nd round Constituent Assembly election 2070 B.S., CPN-UML has dominated the local politics. The long time UML student wing activist turned- politician Sher Dhan Rai ‡§∂‡•á‡§∞‡§ß‡§® ‡§∞‡§æ‡§à from Thidinkha Village (‡§•‡§ø‡§¶‡§ø‡§ô‡•ç‡§ñ‡§æ) became victorious to represent in National Assembly election. After the promulgation of new Constitution and formation of new government under UML, he was nominated for the position of Minister for Communication of Nepal Government. He is the first local politician from the whole southern part of Bhojpur to become a Cabinet Minister of New Republic Nepal. People of this whole region was proud of him. Unfortunately his tenure ended, as the new government was formed under the leadership of Pushpa Kamal Dahal. He was also elected as member of House of Representative in 2056 B.S.  Past  In 2015 BS, Krishna Lal Rai contested in the local election of Bhojpur from the Gorkha Parishad led by Dr. K I Singh. He lost the election with the total vote of 360. Dhan Keshar Bista, Bhuidal Rai, Padam Rai are some notable local politicians during Panchayat system.  Ramu Rai and Balankha  Ramu Rai's house It was Ramu Rai who led Balankha and whole southern belt to the main political arena of Bhojpur. He participated in General Election held in 1999 for the seat of Member of Parliament from Rastriya Prajatantra Party. A medical professional turned politician, Ramu was very popular among the people of Bhojpur, especially southern Bhojpur. Because of him, Balankha region finally got noticed in Bhojpur politics. He raised the local voice, local issues to the district authorities and central leaders. During the Panchayat regime he became synonymous with Balankha. People of far distant villages used to refer Balankha as \\"Ramu ko gaon\\" (Ramu's village). As his popularity was growing, the Panchayat system was coming to an end. After the end of the Panchayat system in 1991, he did not opt to join the other mainstream political parties. He rather chose to stay with his former Pancha's pro king party Rastriya Prajatantra Party. The new political development slowly pushed aside all the pro king parties. It directly affected his political career, where most people were against the king. Many local youths who once were his staunch supporters, started to distance themselves. Later, he left Balankha and moved to Kathmandu. Balankha at Present Padule pokhari As the motor road is expanding to south and north, there is noticeable change in Balankha bazar. When the most difficult road construction at the Tare Bhir between Pangcha and Balankha was completed, it in fact, not only connected Balankha to whole Terai region but it also opened up a new possibilities of trade and transportation activities of this region which will eventually support the local economy. Thanks to the local committee of road construction who in support of Minister Sherdhan Rai received one million Rupees from the Road Department and carried out the construction. The only obstacle now is to build a motor bridge on Koshi river linking Ranitar of Udaypur. Balankha is now well connected to all the major hubs of Bhojpur and Khotang districts such as Ghoretar, Mane Bhanjyang, Chisapani, Katunje etc. Recently local transportation entrepreneurs have started services from Balankha to Beltar and Dharan via Ranitar. Water supply Balankha bazar has become more vibrant now than it was few years ago when there was no road. It is seeing more offices and more shops, hotel, restaurants, various services such as remittance service, mobile service, computer service and internet services etc. Telecommunication towers are also being built in the private and public both sector. Police post and Health post have already been serving the locals for long time. Beside that local farmers have started to grow various types of cash crops. A significant number of people from Balankha and surrounding are working abroad. They all support their family and village through remittance they send. Keeping this in mind Western Union services is now operating locally and it is a big relief as local people do not need to travel to Ghoretar or Bhojpur to receive their money sent by their loved ones. The Balankha Support Group (BSG) is one small group that has been trying to help Balankha too. Currently it is trying to provide books and set up a library for Chandeswor High School. Through social media like Facebook it has created a network among the people who are directly and indirectly related to Balankha and the surrounding area. In future it is aiming to contribute to other social issues of the region. Offices in Balankha: * Health Post (staffed by three health workers) * Police Post (staffed with eleven personnel) * Women Development organization * Agricultural Development Branch * Chandeswor Higher Secondary School (+2) Road to Balankha Challenges Road has brought new hopes and possibilities for the growth of this bazar. However every growth has growing pains. Balankha as an emerging town needs to address a lot of issues and challenges before they become huge problem. As bazar grows, it needs enough Water Supply, proper Garbage and Drain system, Electricity or Solar power, uninterrupted Communication System, Health care facilities, Police Station and Emergency Services. The local authorities and bazar people should not be too late to focus on these infrastructure developments. Other features such as Park, Sports ground, Wide street with side walk, tree plantation along the road and even proper building design and clean environment should also be considered, if Balankha wants to be a model town in the region.

Manhunt  In 1961, Anatoliy Golitsyn, a major in the KGB, was assigned to the embassy in Helsinki, Finland, under the name \\"Ivan Klimov.\\" On 15 December, he defected to the US, along with his wife and daughter, by riding the train to the Swedish border. Golitsyn's defection so alarmed the KGB that orders were sent out to cancel all meetings with field agents out of fear that they would be identified. Golitsyn was flown to the US and interviewed by David Murphy, the head of the CIA's Soviet Russia Division. After some time, Golitsyn began making increasing demands of the US and complaining about his treatment. Considering him to be unreliable, Murphy passed him on to James Jesus Angleton, the CIA's director of counterintelligence. Golitsyn's description of a traitor in the CIA, whom he knew only as \\"Sasha\\", led Angleton to embark on a multiyear manhunt that accused many members of the CIA of being the spy.

He was the second editor of The Hindu after G. Subramania Iyer and the founder of the Indian Patriot. Karunakara Menon was born at Parappanangadi, Malabar district (Cozhisseri Tharavadu, Neduva) and had his higher education in Madras. He served as a sub- editor of The Hindu till 1898 and as editor from 1898 to 1905. In 1905, he started the Indian Patriot which was closed in 1924. He was a prominent public man and took part in the political events of his time. Menon died in 1922 in his residence 'Cozhisseri' at Parappanangadi, Kerala State due to complications following a stroke. He was highly regarded by V. Krishnaswamy Iyer, Veeraraghavachariar, G. Subramania Iyer and Governor of Madras, Sir Arthur Lawley.  Early life  Karunakara Menon was born in a Nair family (Cozhisseri Tharavadu) of Parappanangadi, Malabar district, Madras Presidency. He graduated in law from the University of Madras and joined The Hindu as a sub-editor.Some Madras Leaders, Pg 88 On graduation, he plunged into public life in 1890 when he opposed the Malabar Marriage Bill of T. Muthuswamy Iyer.Some Madras Leaders, Pg 87A short essay by Karunakara Menon on the Malabar Marriage Bill Menon's opposition to the bill impressed Muthuswamy Iyer to such an extent that a close friendship developed between the two. During this time, Menon also developed friendship with T. Madhava Rao.  Rise to prominence  When G. Subramania Iyer, the editor of The Hindu, travelled to the United Kingdom to give evidence before the Welby Commission, Menon managed the newspaper in his absence with the assistance of Mr. Natarajan, who later became the editor of the Indian Social Reform.Some Madras Leaders, Pg 89 When Veeraraghavachariar took over The Hindu in October 1898, he appointed Karunakara Menon as the editor. Menon edited The Hindu till 1905 when he founded The Indian Patriot. In 1903, Veeraraghavachariar said of Karunakara Menon:  Editorship of The Indian Patriot  The Indian Patriot toed a difficult path. It was one of the few newspapers of the time which openly supported the Indian National Congress.Some Madras Leaders, Pg 90 It strongly opposed the perpetuators of the Alipore bomb case and claimed to stand on the side of law and order. The British responded by honouring Karunakara Menon with a \\"Diwan Bahadur\\" for his assistance . Menon antagonised both the extremists as well as the British establishment and devoid of support, he was forced to sell his newspaper to meet expenses.Some Madras Leaders, Pg 91  Death  Menon died in 1922 at his residence Cozhissery House in Parappanangadi due to complications of stroke.  As a statesman  V. Krishnaswamy Iyer had a very high opinion of Menon's abilities. He felt that Menon was a statesman of good calibre and that he was wasting his time in the journalism profession. He is believed to have remarked once: Krishnaswamy Iyer's views were supported by the fact that the then Governor of Madras, Arthur Lawley consulted Menon regularly. It is believed that Menon had enough statesmanship ability to serve as a Diwan of Travancore or Chief Minister of Madras.Some Madras Leaders, Pg 93  Ideology  Menon supported the Home Rule Movement in Madras Presidency. Even while he opposed the political ambitions of the non-Brahmin movement he still supported their social reform activities.

This groove is used to either break the material along the slit, for decoration, or act as a guideline for other processes such as painting. It can also be used to allow materials to expand and contract under varying thermal conditions. Scoring is used in place of cutting through the material all the way because you can obtain relatively the same results with less time and labor. Disadvantages of scoring * When breaking along the score line the material may deviate from the set guideline. * The back side of the break line has a jagged edge to it from the shear fracture. * Scoring offers very little use to metallic materials.

The Chiricahua settled in southeastern Arizona, southwestern New Mexico of the present-day United States, and northern Sonora, and northern Chihuahua of present-day Mexico. By the late 19th century, the Chiricahua Apache territory encompassed an estimated 15 million acres.Turcheneske, John Anthony, Jr. \\"Historical Territory\\", Fort Sill Apache Tribe, 2003 (retrieved 1 Feb 2009) In 1886 to break up the Apache Wars and resistance to European-American settlement, the US federal government took the Chiricahua into custody as prisoners of war and seized their land.

In 1894, the US Congress passed a special provision to allow the Chiricahua to be relocated to Indian Territory. They were the last Indian tribe to be relocated into what is now Oklahoma. When the Chiricahua arrived at Fort Sill, they had been promised the lands surrounding the fort as theirs to settle. Local non- Indians resisted Apache settlement, and the tribe was pressured to leave. Many wanted to return to their traditional lands in the Southwest, and the Mescalero Apache offered them land on their reservation. A third of the Chiricahua stayed in Indian Territory, demanding that the US fulfill its promise to give them the Fort Sill lands. As a compromise, the government gave the remaining Chiricahua land which it had classified as surplus after allotment of tribal lands to individual households under the Dawes Act, on the nearby Kiowa-Comanche-Apache Reservation. In 1914, the US government finally released 84 individuals from prisoner status and granted them household allotment lands around Fletcher and Apache, Oklahoma. The Fort Sill Apache struggled for survival in the ensuing years in the economically depressed areas of southwestern Oklahoma. The tribe seized the opportunity afforded by Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act of 1936. Persevering through the difficulty of satisfying documentation requirements for tribal continuity, they were recognized by the federal government (Department of Interior) as a tribe in 1976. The first chairperson, elected in 1976, was Mildred Cleghorn, one of the last Chiricahua Apache born under \\"prisoner of war\\" status.

Description Pair by John Gould The Norfolk thrush was mainly dark brown in colour, with a pale grey-brown head and upper breast. It was about 21 cm in length, with a wingspan of 34 cm and a weight of 55 g. It had a yellow bill, orbital ring and legs. Males and females were similar in size and appearance.Higgins et al.

Behaviour=Breeding The subspecies nested in trees, including the introduced lemon tree. The clutch size was 2‚Äì4.Higgins et al. (2006), p. 1873. Feeding The Norfolk thrush foraged mainly on the ground, in leaf litter, for small invertebrates, seeds and fallen fruit.Higgins et al. (2006), p. 1872. Status and conservation The subspecies became extinct around the late 1970s, with the last confirmed record in 1975. The cause of its extinction is attributed to a combination of clearing of native vegetation and predation by rats and feral cats. Additional factors were competition with introduced song thrushes and common blackbirds, as well as by interbreeding with the latter species producing sterile offspring.Higgins et al.

Throughout much of its history, the United States prepared its troops in both the United States Marines and the United States Army to fight land from sea into the center of battle. History The United States' first role in amphibious warfare was inaugurated when the Continental Marines made their first amphibious landing on the beaches of the Bahamas during the Battle of Nassau on 2 March 1776. Even during the Civil War, the United States Navy's ships brought ashore soldiers, sailors, and Marines to capture coastal forts. General Robert E. Lee, the Confederate Army commander, declared: :\\"Wherever his [Union] fleet can be brought, no opposition to his landing can be made except within range of our fixed batteries. We have nothing to oppose his heavy guns, which sweep over the low banks of this country with irresistible force.\\"Bern Anderson, By Sea and by River: The Naval History of the Civil War, 1962; Chap.4, pg. 46 The victory over Spain in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War had greatly enabled the expansion of the United States. By the time the Treaty of Paris was ratified in 1898 the United States had annexed the Philippines in the western Pacific to influence foreign relations in China and Korea; primarily through the presence of the Asiatic Squadron. The administration of President William McKinley included GuamPaul Carano and Pedro C. Sanchez, A Complete History of Guam, (Rutland, VT: C. E. Tuttle Co., 1964). and the Hawaiian Islands to the south Pacific insular areas of Samoa. Also, Congress approved the Foraker Act in the annexation of Puerto Rico for the defense and protection of the newly independent Cuba from any possible foreign attack. The government also negotiated with Nicaragua and Colombia for the right to build an isthmian canal through Panama. Due to the new, vast expansion of territory, the Navy began to assume strategic duties unimagined before 1898.Allan R. Millett, Semper Fidelis: The History of the United States Marine Corps, (New York City, NY: The Free Press, 1991). In 1900, the \\"General Board of the Navy\\" was established to foresee and make recommendations on naval policy, assuming the tasks of the nation's naval expeditionary and strategic challenges.William M. McBride, Technological Change and the United States Navy, 1865‚Äî1945, (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2000). Around this time, the General Board developed some potential war plans for possible events that may be measured if such attacks were to be aimed for the continental east coast, the Antilles of the Caribbean, or the Panama Canal. The most dangerous, likely foe that the United States Navy faced was the British Royal Navy, and had been implemented into War Plan Red,Floyd W. Rudmin, Bordering on Aggression: Evidence of U.S. Military Preparations Against Canada, (Nashville, TN: Voyageur Publishing Co., May 1993). however, relations had improved and both already committed to a growing rapprochement. It instead agreed that the next likely foe would be the Germany's Imperial Navy, a burgeoning force of warships that were at the disposal of Emperor Wilhelm II. In response to possible German naval invasion of the Caribbean or attacks on the east coast, the United States devised War Plan Black.Michael Lind, The American Way of Strategy: US Foreign Policy and the American Way of Life, (Oxford, NY: Oxford University Press, 2006) To also include Germany having purchased Spain's remaining central Pacific island colonies, and the Mariana Islands and the Caroline Islands, and its establishment of a naval base in China in 1900. And after the Russo-Japanese War, victorious Imperial Japan had serious plans of expanding its influence south and in the west Pacific. The United States Navy solely relied on the islands for refueling stations for the coal-powered navy ships; the lifeline to the naval bases in the Philippines and Guam. If such an attack was initiated by the Japanese, a system of Pacific naval bases were needed to be built, in order to put War Plan Orange into effect.Seward W. Livermore, \\" American Naval Base Policy in the Far East\\", Pacific Historical Review; 13, pgs/ 113‚Äì135. The sum of it all, the Navy's war planning after 1900 assumed that maritime attacks on the United States and its interests were possible in both the Pacific and the Caribbean, and given the thousands of miles the fleet would have to steam to provide security to the outermost bases of Guam, the Philippines, or of the similar. The General Board was convinced that it would require Marine expeditionary battalions that were capable in the hastily development of advanced bases, and it could not depend on the small and overextended United States Army to defend the bases in short, limited order. Advanced Base Force On the outset of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the Marines stormed the beaches of Cuba and captured Guantanamo Bay while the United States Army landed at Santiago. It was First Lieutenant Dion Williams, who raised the United States Flag at Manila Bay in 1898. Lt. Williams later epitomized the modernized doctrine of amphibious operations, focusing on seizure, preparation, and defense of advance bases, which also adopted the concept of amphibious reconnaissance.Maj Dion Williams, Naval Reconnaissance, Instructions for the Reconnaissance of Bays, Harbors, and Adjacent Country, 1906 The Marine Corps had begun to come to the realization of utilizing methods of seizing and defending objectives on shore. The Marine Corps Commandant, Brigadier General William P. Biddle sent orders to Earl H. Ellis, a Marine Officer, to the Advance Force Base, which in later years was re- established as the Fleet Marine Force in regards to his report and thesisEarl H. Ellis, Naval Bases; Location, Resources, Denial of Bases, Security of Advanced Bases, 1913 he had written at the Navy War College concerning the setting up of advanced bases. The Advanced Base School was created in conjunction for the Advanced Base Force in New London, Connecticut in 1910. Fleet Marine Force By the 1930s, the Fleet Marine Force, which consists of the United States Navy and Marine Corps was developed. During this period, they began to modernize amphibious warfare that fabricated into the seminal Tentative Landing Operations ManualTentative Landing Operations Manual which was implemented in 1935. The doctrine set forth the organization, theory and practice of landing operations by establishing new troop organization and the development of amphibious landing crafts and tractors. Also, they emphasized the use of aerial and naval support in beach landings for the troops. The final element of the formula was the annual exercises called the 'Fleet Landing Exercises' (FLEX), which were conducted in the Caribbean, the California coast, and in the Hawaiian Islands, and which were similar to the exercises conducted by Lt. Col. Earl \\"Pete\\" Ellis on Culebra by the Advanced Base Force in January, 1914.Dirk A. Ballendorf & Merrill L. Bartlett, Pete Ellis: An Amphibious Warfare Prophet 1880-1923, 1997 This preparation proved invaluable in World War II, when the Marines not only spearheaded many of the attacks against Japanese-held islands in the Pacific theater of war, but also helped train the United States Army divisions that also participated in the island-hopping campaign. Amphibious Corps Throughout the Pacific campaign during World War II, the United States Army and Marine Corps trained the new graduated recruits in joint-amphibious operations. Even the Army conducted its own facility to accommodate the training necessary, establishing the Amphibious Training Center (ATC). It was pointed out that the number of amphibious troops in the United States was inadequate and that the Marine Corps was undermanned due to expansion problems in the Navy's budget. To further complicate problems in the development of amphibious warfare amongst the Marine Corps was that they were organized for aggressive, but limited objectives, instead of extensive operations that fully relied on larger ground forces that were capable of sustaining longer in combat, due to being well- funded and equipped. A notable result of the ATC was the deployment of Engineer Amphibian Brigades (later called Engineer Special Brigades), which were largely responsible for much of the amphibious resupply doctrine still in use by the United States Marine Corps today. The United States Navy controlled many joint units of the Army and the Marine Corps. The combined Army/Marine units consisted of two amphibious corps, the Amphibious Corps of the Pacific Fleet and of the Atlantic Fleet. These units represented the sum total of the amphibious forces of the United States, with the exception of small units of the Fleet Marine Force, which had been trained for amphibious raids. It was apparent that the United States Marine Corps did not have sufficient troops trained for the type of operation which was necessary to win the war. To sever the problems, the United States Navy controlled two joint Army-Marine \\"amphibious corps\\", in which the Army and Marine Corps's forces were attached under: #Amphibious Corps, Pacific Fleet (ACPF) ‚Äì 3rd Infantry Division and the 2nd Marine Division #Amphibious Corps, Atlantic Fleet (ACAF) ‚Äì 1st Infantry Division, 9th Infantry Division, and the 1st Marine Division By 1943, primarily due to disagreements between the services, the Army closed its Amphibious Training Center. Subsequently, the Marine subordinate units of the Amphibious Corps, Pacific Fleet (ACPF) were re-designated under the full command of the Marine Corps's V Amphibious Corps (VAC). In 1957, the Army ceded the amphibious operation role to the Marine Corps.

Classification: Aerophone-Whistle Flute-recorder. In the Old Rus' this instrument was made either of hollow reed or cylindrical wood branches. A legend says that Lel', son of the Slavic goddess of love Lada was a svirel player. In spring he would make his svirel of birch branches. Traditional Russian svirel has not yet been studied well enough. Specialists have long tried to relate the present day‚Äôs pipe instruments to their Old Russian names. Most often the chroniclers used three names for this type instruments: svirel, sopel (sopilka) and tsevnitsa. Construction Svirel is a simple wooden (sometimes metal) pipe. On the upper end it has a beak-like whistle device and in the middle of the face side it has several (usually six) finger-holes cut out. Wooden pipe is made of buckthorn, hazel, maple, ash tree, or bird cherry tree. Etymology The word svirel is obviously older than sopel, since it can be found in the Common Slavonic language and, consequently, it had existed in the epoch preceding the division of this language into the Eastern, Western and Southern branches. Yet, it is difficult to say whether this name referred to a definite kind of instrument: in the Old Rus‚Äô any wind instrument player but for horn or trumpet players was called svirets or sviryanin. History So, svirel playing traditions of the Russians seem to be much older than the epoch of the Eastern Slavic community. Two such pipes were found during archeological excavations of the Old Novgorod in 1951-1962. One of them dating back to the late 11th century is 22.5 cm (approximately 9 inches) long and has four finger-holes. The second pipe dating to the early 15th century is 19 cm (approximately 7.5 inches) long and has only three holes. However, it is difficult to say whether the Old Russian svirel was a double or a single pipe: there is no data about this preserved. What makes things still more complicated is the fact that names of similar instruments of kindred nations, such as Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians are often mixed. N. I. Privalov fixed the name svirel to the double pipe, because this is how the instrument was called in Smolensk region, the major area of its popularity. This being the case the single svirel came to be called sopel. Nowadays svirel is more and more often referred to the end-blown flute type instrument with a whistle device nested into its upper part. Playing technique Double svirel has two similar pipes of different lengths. Each of the pipes has a whistle and three finger-holes. Size of the double svirel varies on a great scale. The bigger pipe can be 29 to 47 cm long, and the smaller 22 to 35 cm. The big pipe is usually held in the right hand and the small one in the left hand. Bringing together two pipes into one instrument makes it possible for one player to perform two-voice melodies. The repertoire of double svirel tunes is quite extensive and versatile. Double svirel was unevenly spread in Russia. In the early 20th century Vasily Andreyev introduced into his orchestra svirels with key mechanism. Instruments of such construction still can be found in modern folk music orchestras.

Gl√ºcksburg Castle in R√∂mhild History After the Duke of Saxe-Gotha, Ernest the Pious, died on 26 March 1675 in Gotha, the Principality was divided on 24 February 1680 among his seven surviving sons. The lands of Saxe-R√∂mhild went to the fourth son, who became Henry, Duke of Saxe-R√∂mhild (1650‚Äì1710). The new Principality included the Districts of R√∂mhild, K√∂nigsberg (which was later lost in 1683 to Saxe-Hildburghausen) and Themar, the winery of Behrungen, the monastery estate of Milz, and certain lands of the Echter family of Mespelbrunn that had been lost in 1665 to Saxony. But Duke Henry never had the full sovereignty of his new domains. The actual administration was left to the higher authorities in Gotha ‚Äì the so-called ‚ÄúNexus Gothanus‚Äù ‚Äì because that was the residence of Henry's oldest brother, who ruled as Frederick I, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. After the death of the childless Henry in 1710, his domains were divided between the four duchies ‚Äì Saxe-Gotha- Altenburg, Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, Saxe-Meiningen and Saxe-Hildburghausen.

Early life and background Frew was born in Glasgow, Scotland, the son of Henry Lorimer Frew and his wife Annie. His father was a partner in the family business of George Frew & Son, sailmakers and cover makers of Paterson Street, Glasgow. First World War Frew enlisted as a private in the Highland Light Infantry in 1914, and after serving on the front lines in France, transferred to the Royal Flying Corps in August 1916. After serving as a cadet, he was commissioned as a probationary temporary second lieutenant on 26 September, was appointed a flying officer on 6 April 1917, and confirmed in his rank on 11 April. On 28 April 1917 Frew was posted to No. 45 Squadron RFC to serve on the Western Front in France, flying the Sopwith 1¬Ω Strutter. He gained his first two victories on 5 June, flying with observer Second Lieutenant M. J. Dalton, then gained three more between 16 July and 10 August with observer Second Lieutenant George Brooke, all over Albatros D.IIIs, to attain flying ace status. No. 45 Squadron was then re- equipped with the Sopwith Camel, and Frew gained his 6th victory on 3 September, two more followed the next day, then another ten by 27 October. On 18 October he was awarded the Military Cross, and on 24 October, though still only a second lieutenant, was appointed a flight commander with the temporary rank of captain. On 17 December he was awarded a Bar to his Military Cross. No. 45 Squadron was then transferred to the Italian Front, and Frew gained another seven victories between 11 January and 4 February, bringing his confirmed total to 23. After his aircraft was hit by anti-aircraft fire on 15 January 1918, Frew suffered from neck pains and was eventually invalided back to England the following month, to serve as a flying instructor at the Central Flying School for the rest of the war. On 4 March he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order, and was promoted to lieutenant on 26 March. On 1 April 1918, the day that the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Naval Air Service were merged to form the Royal Air Force, Frew was again appointed a temporary captain. He received mentions in dispatches on 18 April and 30 May, and on 12 September was granted permission to wear the Silver Medal for Military Valour awarded to him by the King of Italy. On 5 May 1919 Frew was transferred to the unemployed list, and his award of the Air Force Cross was gazetted shortly after on 30 May. Inter-war career On 24 October 1919 Frew rejoined the RAF on a short service commission with the rank of flight lieutenant. From 19 February 1920 he served on the Air Staff at the headquarters of No. 7 Group RAF, then on 8 June was posted to the RAF (Cadet) College at RAF Cranwell to serve on the staff and as an instructor. On 28 July 1921 Frew was granted a permanent commission in the RAF, retaining his rank and seniority, and his short service commission was cancelled. On 8 December 1921 he was posted to No. 6 Squadron RAF in the Middle East Area, then to No. 4 Flying Training School in Egypt on 14 October 1923 to serve as a flying instructor. On 16 December 1925 Frew returned to the Home Establishment, to serve on the staff of the Armament and Gunnery School at RAF Eastchurch, where on 1 July 1927 he was promoted to squadron leader. On 24 July 1927 he was appointed Chief Flying Instructor at No. 1 Flying Training School, RAF Netheravon. Frew returned to the Middle East when on 10 March 1931 he was appointed to serve on the Air Staff (Operations) at the Headquarters of RAF Iraq Command based at RAF Hinaidi. On 11 May 1933 he was appointed Officer Commanding, No. 111 Squadron RAF, and received a Bar to his DSO on 6 October. On 1 July 1934 he was promoted to wing commander, and on 15 August was appointed Officer Commanding, No. 10 (B) Squadron RAF, based at RAF Boscombe Down. On 22 March 1937 he was appointed Officer Commanding, RAF Hornchurch, taking command on 2 April, and on 1 July 1938 he was promoted to group captain. On 2 August 1938 he was appointed Senior Air Staff Officer of No. 23 (Training) Group, based at RAF Grantham. Second World War On 1 September 1940 Frew was appointed Air Officer Commanding, Training Headquarters, South African Air Force. On 1 December 1940 he was promoted to temporary air commodore, and again to acting air vice marshal on 16 September 1942, when he assumed the position of AOC, Directorate of Air Training, SAAF. Frew was made a Companion of the Bath on 1 January 1943, and on 1 June was promoted from air commodore (acting air vice marshal) to temporary air vice marshal. On 16 September 1943 his rank of acting air commodore was made war substantive, and from 24 September was permitted to wear insignia of a Commander in the Royal Order of George I with Swords, conferred \\"in recognition of valuable services rendered in connection with the war\\" by the King of the Hellenes. On 15 June 1945 Frew was granted permission to wear the Military Cross, 1st class, conferred by the Belgian government. On 1 January 1946 he was promoted from air commodore (temporary air vice marshal) to air vice marshal,, and on 1 January 1948 was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire. Frew retired from the RAF at his own request on 19 December 1948. Air Vice Marshal Frew died in Pretoria, South Africa, on 28 May 1974.

Walker, Jr. (November 24, 1933 ‚Äì May 26, 1973) was an American football player. He was an All-American at the University of Michigan in 1954 and played seven seasons of professional football with the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League from 1955-1961. Early years Walker, an African-American who grew up four miles east of South Haven, Michigan, attended South Haven High School where he was an All-Big Seven Conference tackle and president of the student council. He was also a catcher on a local baseball team. University of Michigan After graduating from high school in 1951, Walker was awarded an Elmer Gedeon scholarship to the University of Michigan. The Gedeon scholarships, created in memory of a multi-sport student athlete who was killed in World War II, were awarded on the basis of \\"moral character, good citizenship, scholastic ability, and achievement, promise of leadership and success, and physical ability.\\" Walker played left tackle at Michigan from 1952-1954. As a 192-pound sophomore in 1952, Walker started nine games for the Wolverines and was named an All-Big Ten Conference player. In June 1953, Walker suffered a setback when he pleaded guilty in Ann Arbor Municipal Court to stealing gasoline from a parked car; Walker and another student admitted siphoning gas from a car parked behind a dormitory and paid fines totaling $16.25. As a 200-pound junior in 1953, Walker suffered from injuries. Walker played with a leg injury against Tulane in October 1954, and the Associated Press described Walker as the \\"sparkplug of the Wolverine line\\" and reported that, despite the injury, he \\"made smashing tackles and was a demon getting down under punts.\\" However, his play against Tulane aggravated the injury, resulting in his missing the following game. As a 218-pound senior in 1954, Walker had his best season at Michigan. He played alongside left end Ron Kramer, giving the Wolverines \\"the strongest defensive left side in the Big Ten.\\" During the 1954 season, Walker played more minutes than any other Michigan player‚Äîplaying 479 out of 540 minutes in Michigan's nine-game schedule. He was named to the 1954 All-Big Ten teams selected by the Associated Press and the United Press. He was also selected to play in the annual East-West Shrine Game, and selected by the Football Writers Association of America to the Look magazine All-American team in 1954. Walker was flown to New York to receive the Look magazine award on The Jackie Gleason Show in December 1954. Walker was the first South Haven athlete ever to receive an All-American rating, and local residents honored him at a testimonial banquet in February 1955. Michigan's line coach Jack Blott spoke at the banquet, and Walker was given a set of luggage. Professional football in Edmonton Walker was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the 12th round of the 1955 NFL Draft, but opted instead to play in the Canadian Football League. Walker told a reporter that he went to Canada because they offered more money than the NFL, and he had heard tales of salary troubles of Green Bay players. Walker played seven seasons of professional football as an offensive tackle and defensive guard for the Edmonton Eskimos from 1955-1961. His best season as a professional player was 1957, when he was named Edmonton's Most Valuable Player and was named to the Western Division all-star teams in two polls, one selected by the fans and the other by sportswriters and broadcasters. He also played in the 1957 CFL All-Star Game. After the 1957 season, Walker told a reporter from his home town that he had no regrets about playing in the CFL, despite having to participate in a practice in 17 below zero weather and playing in a game in six below zero weather. In seven seasons with the Eskimos, he became one of the team's most popular players. After a victory over the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in 1959, a Winnipeg columnist credited Walker with the victory: > There are many reasons why the Bombers failed to make it close, but a major > one was a gent by the name of Art Walker. Even a delighted Eagle Keys went > on record that he had never seen Walker play a better game than he did last > night. Art handled Ed Kotowich and Fred Cole as if he owned them. Another writer described Walker's performance in the same game as follows: > Thursday night Walker, who seemed bent on some personal vendetta, simply > refused to let Winnipeg run anything to the left side of the Edmonton line. > Mostly it was sheer ability, but to make his performance even more galling > to the Winnipeg offensive unit, every time he guessed right. Walker's football career came to an end after the 1961 season. He missed most of the 1960 season with a damaged Achilles tendon and battled through pain during training camp in 1961. After making it through the first 15 games of the 1961 season without an injury, Walker's Achilles tendon injury returned in the third quarter of the season's final game. Following the game, Walker told a reporter that, as he hobbled to the sidelines, he knew his football career were over. He said: > I'd never go through another training camp like I did this year. Anyway > what's the point of kidding anyone. I'd never be able to play as well again, > even if I tried. After retiring from football, Walker stated his intent to remain in Edmonton as his permanent home. He noted that he and his wife had good teaching jobs in Edmonton, and \\"the people in Edmonton have been wonderful to both my family and myself.\\" According to the book \\"The Canadian Pro Football Encyclopedia\\" by Tod Maher and Bob Gill (Maher Sports Media 2011) Walker died on May 26, 1973 in Marquette, Michigan at age 39.

conflict of World War II. The operation was originally set to be executed in May 1942 immediately following Operation MO and before Operation MI, which resulted in the Battle of Midway. The primary reason for the operation was to exploit the islands' supplies of phosphate. After a postponement due to interference by enemy forces, the operation was completed in August 1942. Background Nauru and Ocean Islands were isolated but rich with phosphate deposits; the deposits were identified around 1900. Nauru was under Australian mandate control, and Ocean Island (or Banaba) was headquarters of the British Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony. In both places, the Melbourne-based British Phosphate Commissioners (BPC) had been running the phosphate mining since 1919, under the Nauru Island Agreement. The phosphate deposits were mined for making fertilisers, ammunition and explosives. The German auxiliary cruisers and sank five merchant ships and bombarded the island causing damage to the phosphate mining, disrupting the Allied production of phosphate. Following the raids, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board requested that the British Admiralty redeploy Australian naval units to meet the threat posed by raiders. The armed merchant cruiser arrived off Ocean Island on 4 January 1941, and Australian and New Zealand warships maintained a continual presence off the islands during the subsequent months. A naval company and two field guns were deployed to each island. The attacks also led to the introduction of convoys between Australia and New Zealand. In late February 1942, as a Japanese invasion of Nauru and Ocean Island was feared, the Free French destroyer departed the New Hebrides to evacuate both places. The ship arrived on 23 February and completed the evacuation without serious incident. Although Operation MO was cancelled on 8 May 1942 immediately following the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Imperial Japanese Navy forces departed Rabaul and Bougainville on 11 May to execute the RY operation. First invasion attempt On 11 May 1942, the Imperial Japanese invasion force departed Rabaul, under the command of Rear Admiral Shima Kiyohide and consisting of the cruiser , the minelayers (flagship) and and the destroyers and , covered by the 5th Cruiser Division, under the command of Rear Admiral Takeo Takagi, consisting of the heavy cruisers and with the Destroyer Division 30 destroyers , , and . The invasion troops from the 6th Special Naval Landing Force (SNLF) and Kashima SNLF were carried by the transports Kinry≈´ Maru and Takahata Maru.Bullard, p. 57. While steaming through driving rain off New Ireland and west of Buka Island, Okinoshima, which had been damaged by airplanes from Yorktown during the invasion of Tulagi on 4 May 1942, was torpedoed at 04:52 by the United States Navy submarine (Commander Oliver G. Kirk) and severely damaged. The invasion force's escorts closed S-42 and depth charged the area until 1130, causing damage. The submarine left the area to return to base at Moreton Bay, Brisbane. Rear Admiral Shima transferred his flag to Y≈´zuki southwest of Buka Island, Bougainville. At 06:40, Okinoshima capsized under tow by Mochizuki in St. George's Channel at . While returning to Rabaul after being dispatched to assist repair work on Okinoshima, the repair ship was torpedoed off Cape St George, New Ireland, by . She sank at 1440 at . In spite of the loss of Okinoshima, the rest of the Japanese forces continued with the operation. As these forces were en route, however, a Japanese reconnaissance aircraft from Tulagi sighted the United States Navy aircraft carriers and heading towards Nauru. The two US carriers, acting on intelligence obtained from intercepted Japanese communications, had been sent to the area as a feint to try to stop the Japanese operation. The feint was successful. Fearing the threat posed by the US carriers to the RY forces, which did not have air cover, the Japanese cancelled the operation on 15 May, and the naval forces returned to Rabaul. Second, successful attempt A second invasion force departed Truk on 26 August 1942, consisting of the cruiser , the destroyers , Y≈´zuki, Ariake, and , and the transport Hakozaki Maru. The landing forces landed on Nauru on 29 August and Ocean Island on 30 August unopposed. Occupation Japanese forces occupied the two islands until the end of the war, but became increasingly isolated as the war progressed. During the Japanese occupation of Nauru, American aircraft repeatedly bombed the island's facilities.

It lies on the road from Idrija pri Baƒçi to Peƒçine to Slap ob Idrijci. Ponikve includes the hamlets and isolated farms of Lazi, Ostro≈ænik, Penƒçek, Pri Puhu, Rob, Rute, V Grapi, Zagomilca, Zapu≈°nik, and Za Vrhom. The village core lies in a basin surrounded by the following hills: Oblaƒçno Brdo (), Pu≈°nik (), Zadnik (), Gasilca (), Kri≈æ (), and Lepa Gorica (). Penƒçek Hill (, ) stands to the east, north of Penƒçek. Intermittent Lake Rupa (surface area 0.12 ha, max. depth 2 m) lies north of the village. The lake is the source of an intermittent influent stream that disappears into a gorge at the end of the village, probably reemerging at Kresnica Cave above the hamlet of Potoka near Slap ob Idrijci. In the eastern part of the village there is a small pond at Na Kalih northeast of Zagomilca, and Grahel Pond () lies on the extreme eastern edge of the village near Penƒçek. Name The name Ponikve is a plural form derived from the word ponikva 'influent stream' or 'sinkhole' (into which such a stream disappears). In its plural form it refers to a gently rolling landscape consisting of the basins of an influent stream. Like other villages named Ponikve and similar names (e.g., Ponikva), it refers to a local landscape element. History The village of Ponikve was burned on 26 July 1907 in a fire caused by a lightning strike. A fire department was established in Ponikve in 1947, and a station was built for it in 1957. In 1974 the department was expanded to serve the entire ≈†entvi≈°ka Gora Plateau. A new fire station was built in 1980, following the earthquake of 1976.Kranjc, Branko. 1992. \\"Gasilsko dru≈°tvo Ponikve - Planota.\\" Zbornik ≈†entvi≈°ke planote, Ponikve, 1992, pp. 97‚Äì98.

The hayracks are the double type, known as the toplar. Visitation Church Visitation Church The parish church in the settlement stand on Kri≈æ Hill and is dedicated to the Visitation and belongs to the Koper Diocese. Three churches are known to have stood at this site.\\"≈Ωupni≈°ka cerkev Obiskanja Device Marije in kapela sv. Ane na Ponikvah\\". Zbornik ≈†entvi≈°ke planote, Ponikve, 1992, pp. 13‚Äì14. The original small Gothic church at this site is believed to date from the 1480s based on a stone plaque on the south side of the church bearing the inscription \\"maister Andre von Lach 148_\\" (the last digit is missing), referring to the prominent builder Andrej of Loka (a.k.a. Andreas von Lack). In the 18th century, a new larger Baroque church was built at the site. At that time the altar and other church valuables were brought to this church from the already abandoned and dilapidated former St. Nicholas' Church, which stood on the hill north of the village. During the Second World War, the Partisans used the church as a stronghold. As a result, on 2 July 1944, on the Feast of the Annunciation, the church was burned by German troops, destroying everything except the altar statue and the shrine of the Holy Sepulchre, which the locals managed to save. The ruins were dynamited in March 1945, leaving only the damaged bell tower and walls. Ponikve village cemetery In 1952, after considerable difficulty and thanks to the efforts of the parish priest Janez Lapanja, the architect Jo≈æe Pleƒçnik agreed to rebuild the church. Work began in 1954, and this third structure was newly consecrated on 19 October 1958 by Archbishop Anton Vovk. In Pleƒçnik's characteristic style, the reconstruction utilized elements of the old structure, including the bell tower. At the same time, the interior and exterior decoration departed radically from the former building, and the orientation of the church was reversed so that the nave is now on the east end, towards the village, and the altar on the west. The church has two bell towers: the old one and a new one on the east side that also contains the stairs to the choir loft. The altar is in the corner to the right and above it is a 2-meter sculpture of the Virgin Mary with the Infant Christ. It was carved from linden wood by the sculptor Jo≈æe Lapuh of Ljubljana. The altar, paving, and columns are the work of Stane Vodnik from Podutik near Ljubljana. The church also contains a chalice made of brass and tombac donated by Pleƒçnik, and a silver chalice donated by Vovk. A second church in the parish is dedicated to Saint Anne.Koper Diocese list of churches This chapel was built in 1862 and was used for masses on weekdays and in the winter, when it was difficult to reach the parish church. It also served as a school in the 19th century, where the parish priest also served as a teacher. It was partially renovated between 1951 and 1953 and a sacristy was added to the structure. Other cultural heritage In addition to Visitation Church, several other structures in Ponikve have protected cultural monument status: *The straight-line housebarn () at Ponikve no. 36, in the center of the village, dated from the first quarter of the 19th century.

The Adcock array was invented and patented by British engineer Frank Adcock in 1919 as British Patent No. 130,490, and has been used for a variety of applications, both civilian and military, ever since. (Note: The patent lawyer's name appears as inventor, with \\"F. Adcock\\" in parentheses, since Lt. Adcock, RE was serving in wartime France at the time.) Although originally conceived for receiving low frequency (LF) waves, it has also been used for transmitting, and has since been adapted for use at much higher frequencies, up to ultra high frequency (UHF). In the early 1930s, the Adcock antenna (transmitting in the LF/MF bands) became a key feature of the newly created radio navigation system for aviation. The low frequency radio range (LFR) network, which consisted of hundreds of Adcock antenna arrays, defined the airways used by aircraft for instrument flying. The LFR remained as the main aerial navigation technology until it was replaced by the VOR system in the 1950s and 1960s. The Adcock antenna array has been widely used commercially, and implemented in vertical antenna heights ranging from over 130 feet (40 meters) in the LFR network, to as small as 5 inches (13 cm) in tactical direction finding applications (receiving in the UHF band). Radio direction finding Diagram from Adcock's 1919 patent, depicting a four-element monopole antenna array; active antenna segments are marked in red. diagonal spacing Japanese Adcock direction finder installation for 2MHz in Rabaul Frank Adcock originally used the antenna as a receiving antenna, to find the azimuthal direction a radio signal was coming from in order to find the location of the radio transmitter; a process called radio direction finding. Prior to Adcock's invention, engineers had been using loop antennas to achieve directional sensitivity. They discovered that due to atmospheric disturbances and reflections, the detected signals included significant components of electromagnetic interference and distortions: horizontally polarized radiation contaminating the signal of interest and reducing the accuracy of the measurement. Adcock--who was serving as an Army officer in the British Expeditionary Force in wartime France at the time he filed his invention--solved this problem by replacing the loop antennas with symmetrically inter-connected pairs of vertical monopole or dipole antennas of equal length. This created the equivalent of square loops, but without their horizontal members, thus eliminating sensitivity to much of the horizontally polarized distortion. The same principles remain valid today, and the Adcock antenna array and its variants are still used for radio direction finding. Low frequency radio range In the late 1920s, the Adcock antenna was adopted for aerial navigation, in what became known as the low frequency radio range (LFR), or the \\"Adcock radio range\\". Hundreds of transmitting stations, each consisting of four or five Adcock antenna towers,A fifth tower was often added in the center of the square for voice transmissions. were constructed around the U.S. and elsewhere. The result was a network of electronic airways, which allowed pilots to navigate at night and in poor visibility, under virtually all weather conditions. The LFR remained as the main aerial navigation system in the U.S. and other countries until the 1950s, when it was replaced by VHF-based VOR technology. By the 1980s all LFR stations were decommissioned.

It is endemic to San Clemente Island, one of the Channel Islands of California. San Clemente Island is owned by the US Navy so the Navy is involved in a management program to recover this species. Description The San Clemente Island Indian paintbrush is a perennial herb coated densely in long gray hairs. The highly branching stem grows 40 to 60 centimeters tall and bears linear leaves each a few centimeters long. The inflorescence is made up of layers of bracts one to two centimeters long, gray-green in color at the bases and tipped with greenish yellow. Between the bracts emerge dull yellow pouched flowers. The fruit is a capsule about a centimeter long containing tiny seeds with netted surfaces. Distribution This species was once considered to be \\"relatively common\\" on its home island.USFWS. Castilleja grisea Five-year Review. September, 2007. Since then the habitat has been severely degraded, mainly by feral goats which were introduced there.The Nature Conservancy The island was also used for grazing sheep and cattle, and some feral pigs were present. The animals may have eaten the plant at times, but they mainly damaged the land by trampling the soil, which led to soil compaction, loss of topsoil, and erosion. The introduction of exotic plant species such as ripgut brome (Bromus diandrus), wild oat (Avena barbata), and red brome (Bromus madritensis rubus) also degraded the habitat. Due to steep terrain of San Clemente Island the exact abundance of Castilleja grisea is not currently known. Recent surveys have discovered new populations of this species. Surveys in 2007 estimate more than 10,000 plants existing. This plant has been a federally listed endangered species since 1977, when it was one of the first species to be designated so.Center for Plant Conservation The plant's population had been drastically reduced by the activity of the feral goats. Its populations has increased at least ten-fold since the removal of these non-native herbivores. The species has recovered so well through management programs by the Navy, it was recommended for downlisting during the last review conducted by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.California Native Plant Society Profile Remaining threats include erosion, invasive grasses, and wildfire from military exercises. The species has a relatively high genetic variability for an uncommon island endemic. This and its steady recovery from low numbers give an optimistic outlook for the species' recovery.

Cines del Sur. Second Edition 2008, Plaza de las Pasiegas Granada. Cines del Sur is an international film festival in Granada, Spain, that focuses on emerging cinemas belonging to what is known as the geo- political south. Film productions (from Asia, Africa and Latin America) which often have limited distribution and screening opportunities find in Cines del Sur a platform to help them gain recognition. Beyond its appearance as a showcase of films, Cines del Sur is also a place for encounters, discussion and sharing among professionals, film lovers and people interested in broadening their social, cultural, economic and political perspective of the globalized world. The festival encourages reflection and debate on the enormous value of diversity and cultural exchange. Programming The Chinese filmmaker Sheng Zhimin, 2007. Sections Cines del Sur has two competitive sections: the Official Section, for feature-length works filmed in 35 mm, and the Mediterr√°neos Section, with awards given to films made in video. The Itineraries Section (an informative section) is a sample of productions from countries of the geopolitical south. The Festival brings together an international jury each year to choose the winning films. Retrospectives The festival offers two retrospectives that can have different focal points, ranging from tributes to particular filmmakers to film series organised by subject matter, and even retrospectives that take an in-depth look at filmmakers who are still active, at a certain historical period or at a country with limited production. Open screen While the festival takes place, several squares and public buildings in Granada become large outdoor cinemas, where all kinds of people come together to enjoy the films shown. Parallel activities A number of events with scholars in the field are organised during the festival and throughout the year, as are film and video workshops, exhibits, seminars, round tables and outdoor screenings. Publications Study and reflection on the cinemas of the south find their place in the Festival‚Äôs publications, which serve to inform readers about the films screened and the subjects and figures who receive tribute in the retrospectives.

The mixtape marked Cudi's first official release. Production was handled by Plain Pat and Emile; samples range from the likes of Outkast to Paul Simon and N.E.R.D to Band of Horses. The mixtape allowed a new progression of Kid Cudi with the release catching the eye of Kanye West, founder of GOOD Music. Cudi would ultimately be signed to GOOD Music later that year. Notably the album contains the song \\"Day 'n' Nite\\", Kid Cudi's commercial debut single, which reached number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. Reception *Rapreviews wrote: \\"We've already learned from Lil Wayne and Kanye West that the public is willing to embrace the martian‚Äîif accordingly entertaining. Fortunately, Kid Cudi isn't short in that respect, and will no doubt only improve upon his stellar debut given proper management and artistic liberation.\\" *Pinpoint Music wrote \\"A Kid Named Cudi blends styles, beats and even genres. From a Mims-esque 'This Is Why I'm Hot' beat in the single 'Day ‚ÄòN‚Äô Night', to the slowed down tracks 'Man on the Moon' and '50 Ways to Make a Record' that will remind you of something by Gym Class Heroes.

He made his first on-screen appearance on 17 February 2009 and his last on 26 November 2010. Storylines=2009‚Äì2010 Nathan and his sister, Maisie, arrive in the village for their father's 50th birthday party. Nathan is immediately attracted to Katie Sugden (Sammy Winward), and when he hears that she has a date with Lee Naylor (Lewis Linford), Nathan delays him with questions about his work. Nathan - who attended agricultural college - is tasked with running the estate by his parents. Nathan continues pursuing Katie, causing trouble between her and Lee by successfully manipulating them both. Following a row with Lee, Katie invites Nathan to spend the night with her. The next day, however, she catches him sneaking out and he admits to not wanting a serious relationship until he sees her reconcile with Lee. Nathan works with Eric Pollard (Chris Chittell), assisting his campaign to be re-elected as local councillor, getting to Eric's son David Metcalfe (Matthew Wolfenden) who was standing against him, via his girlfriend, Leyla Harding (Roxy Shahidi). He gives her a job, an advance for new clothes and makes a large donation to her mother's nursing home. On finding out, Leyla asks him to withdraw it but he refuses, making it clear what he wants in return. Disgusted, she throws a suit at him and leaves. She tells David and they confront Nathan who loses his temper, and Leyla throws water over him to cool down. However, on 4 June, David is elected as councillor. In late June, Nathan is angry about Lee moving in with Katie so he causes trouble for them again and Lee quits his job. Angry, Katie ends her relationship with Nathan and throws Lee out. Nathan responds by trying to sabotage her business and Katie responds by telling him she is moving her business elsewhere but when this fails, Nathan delights in raising her rent. Nathan befriends Ryan Lamb (James Sutton). He is not pleased when Ryan and Katie start dating but is more distressed with his father's \\"affair\\" with Ryan's mother Faye (Kim Thomson). He goes to London for a while to clear his head. Returning his attentions to Leyla in October, Nathan separates her and David by using his parents' contacts to get David more work. Leyla doesn't help when she borrows money from the petty cash in the farm shop's till and is caught when Nathan collects it early. He sees money missing but conceals it when Leyla confesses and starts charming her, taking her to exclusive parties. They sleep together but Leyla feels guilty so Nathan blackmails her to take responsibility for him crashing a car whilst drunk. Struggling with her conscience, Leyla tells David that she slept with Nathan and he splits up with her but he hits Nathan for bullying her. Nathan's mother Natasha realises that something is wrong and asks Katie, who tells her David hit Nathan but Nathan twists it so that Leyla gets the blame. Angry at Nathan's manipulation, she visits him and tells him she won't quit her job and knees him in the groin. After this, Nathan leaves Leyla alone. In January, after his father's disappearance, Nathan takes over running Home Farm so Natasha can concentrate on taking care of Maisie and Will. Nathan is furious to discover that Faye is, in fact, Mark's first wife and Ryan is his half-brother, and that Natasha knew. Later in the month Natasha begins behaving erratically. Noticing her odd behaviour, Nathan confronts her and she tells him that she killed Mark and buried his body on the Estate grounds. Nathan is outraged and takes a shovel and tries to locate his father's body and dig it up. Natasha then subdues Nathan by telling him that it had been an accident and that the gun had discharged during a struggle. Nathan agrees to keep his mother's secret but demands her fortune in return. Natasha reluctantly gives him everything on the condition that he left and never returned. Nathan keeps his side of the bargain and leaves the village in early February. In May 2010, Nathan returns, shocking his mother. She tells him to leave, and he stays the night at the B&B.; Natasha later agrees to let him stay at Home Farm on one condition, that he pay back the money he blackmailed from her. Nathan pays back the money and Natasha lets him work for her again. Nathan takes an instant dislike to his mother's new business partner, Declan Macey (Jason Merrells) who had bought Nathan's share of the estate whilst he had been away. Nathan demanded his share back but Declan refuses to give it to him. Nathan is further enraged when Declan and Natasha begin a relationship and he threatens to report her to the police for his father's murder but Natasha threatens to take him down with her for helping her cover up the crime. Nathan makes a deal with Declan after his plans for a barn renovation are turned down. Nathan offers to get the planning permission for Declan if he agreed to stay away from Natasha. To do this, Nathan blackmails local councillor David. He gets council employee Tania Page to attempt to seduce David and records it with a hidden video camera and makes it seem that he is having an affair. Nathan threatens to tell Leyla and show her the video if David did not agree to his demands. After David gets Nathan the planning permission, Declan notices that David appears unhappy and Nathan reveals that he blackmailed David, leaving Declan horrified. In June 2010, a bouquet of flowers is sent to Home Farm and is signed with Mark's name and is paid for using his credit card. Natasha believes that Nathan sent the flowers as part of a sick joke and she throws them at his car as he drives up to the house. One of Mark's suits is sent to Declan's house and he confronts Nathan and accuses him of sending it. Nathan denies sending the flowers and the suit but he later pretends to confess to sending the flowers to Maisie in order to cover his mother's tracks. Believing Nathan is the culprit, Maisie is upset and angry with him and orders him out of the pub when he comes in for a drink. Nathan goes to his car and discovers a not stuck to the windscreen saying \\"What are you hiding\\"? Nathan sees Ryan walking past and accuses him of being the stalker. Ryan is angry at the accusation and he and Nathan square up but Ryan's boss Cain Dingle (Jeff Hordley) breaks them up. Nathan gets in his car and drives home. Nathan later receives another note from the blackmailer arranging a meeting by the river. Nathan drives to the location and waits. The blackmailer reveals himself and it turns out to be Cain. Nathan asks Cain what he wants and Cain tells him that he knows the Wyldes are hiding something. He asks Nathan to arrange a meeting between him and Natasha before leaving. Natasha later pays Cain to keep quiet and stay away from their family. In July 2010 Mark's body is discovered by Sam Dingle (James Hooton) whilst he is walking his dog. Nathan and Natasha agree to frame Faye for the murder. But Nathan frames Ryan instead, planting the murder weapon at the garage where Ryan works, and after gaining entry to Ryan's home, planting gunpowder residue on one of Ryan's shirts. He also steals one of Ryan's gold necklaces and plants it at the scene of the crime. The day after Mark's body is found, Nathan is arrested and questioned by the police but later released without charge due to a lack of evidence. However, during his interrogation he discovers that Mark was shot from six feet away and that Natasha had been lying when she said that Mark's death had been accidental, during a struggle. When he returns home, Nathan tells Natasha that if she doesn't help prove his innocence, he will report her to the police himself. Ryan is later arrested after the police discover his chain at the scene of the crime. He is then charged with the murder after the police discover the gun buried at the garage. Nathan taunts Cain, knowing that Cain cannot help Ryan without incriminating himself for fraud and blackmail. At Mark's funeral Nathan is visibly upset at the loss of his father. However he is furious when he sees that Ryan had been given permission to attend the funeral. When Ryan attempts to ask Maisie to believe that he is innocent Nathan attacks him. Asking him if this was Ryan's \\"final desperate plea\\" and calling his sibling \\"pathetic\\", Nathan is delighted when Natasha tells the prison guards to take Ryan away. When Maisie discovers a picture on her mobile phone of Ryan wearing his necklace after the murder occurred she becomes convinced of his innocence, much to Nathan's horror. After distracting her in the cafe, he steals her phone from her bag after she goes to the toilet and deletes the picture but she manages to obtain another copy from Katie. After Cain tells Maisie about the blackmail and being paid by Natasha to keep quiet, she confronts Nathan and Natasha and demands the truth. She accuses Nathan of committing the murder and brands him a coward. Nathan is horrified that his sister thinks he is a murderer and begs Natasha to tell Maisie he is innocent and she does so. But Maisie does not believe them and leaves the village. When Mark's will is read, Nathan receives his inheritance and flaunts his wealth, telling Faye and David that he will be test driving new cars. Nathan is outraged when Faye tells them she will contest the will. Nathan later visits Ryan is prison to gloat and mockingly asks him to tell Faye not to contest the will. When Nathan implies that he will hurt Faye, Ryan attacks him and the brothers have to be separated. Nathan later discovers that Ryan is in a relationship with prison guard Abi Peterson (Catherine Tyldesley) when he sees her leaving Faye's house and recognizes her from the prison visiting room. Abi calls him scumbag and he threatens to tell the prison service. Abi is later transferred to another prison. Nathan lets himself into Faye's house after she accidentally leaves the back door open and taunts her, telling her that Ryan's relationship with Abi would have serious repercussions for him at the trial. Faye throws Nathan out. Maisie later returns to the village and avoids Nathan, whenever he comes near her. She goes to stay at Faye's house and Nathan accuses her of trying to prove the innocence of their father's killer. Nathan later tells Natasha that he can't cope with lying to Maisie any more and considers telling her the truth. But Natasha tells him that because Maisie is fragile, due to her previous mental health problems, the truth would be too much for her and it would cause her to go off the rails again. Nathan breaks down in tears in his mother's arms. The following day, Nathan tells Natasha he is looking forward to seeing Ryan get imprisoned and she is relieved to have him on her side again. Maisie asks to meet Nathan and again asks him the truth about Mark's death but again he tells her that Ryan is the killer. She leaves angrily. When Ryan's trial begins Nathan is nervous about giving evidence. However, when he testifies against his brother, he gives the jury the impression that Ryan is unstable due to his relationship with Maisie and the revelations about their true identities, and that Ryan is jealous of the Wylde's for having the family he never had. After giving evidence, Nathan is kidnapped by Cain and held captive in the Dingles' old barn. He tries to free himself but is unsuccessful. He offers Cain money but Cain refuses it and tells Nathan that if Ryan is found guilty, he will kill him but would release him if he is found not guilty. He pours beer over Nathan and taunts him. After Jai Sharma (Chris Bisson) and Cain's girlfriend and second cousin Charity Tate (Emma Atkins) try to enter the barn and nearly discover Nathan, Cain moves him to an abandoned barn on the moors. Charity follows Cain to the barn and discovers he is holding Nathan captive. Whilst Cain and Charity argue, Nathan tries to free himself and is nearly successful but Cain catches him in time and with Charity's help, holds him down and reties the ropes holding him. After Ryan is found guilty Cain receives a text message telling him of the development and he tells Nathan things have got a lot worse for him. Nathan is terrified. Cain summons Maisie to the barn and when Nathan sees her, he begs her to help him. Maisie refuses and demands the truth from Nathan about the circumstances of their father's death, still believing Nathan to be the killer. She attacks Nathan with a piece of wood in an attempt to get him to confess to the murder. Distraught and believing that Maisie would kill him, Nathan reveals that Natasha is Mark's killer but Maisie refuses to believe him. Cain goes to Home Farm and summons Natasha and Will. They arrive in time to see Maisie about to hit Nathan with the wood. In order to pacify Maisie, Natasha confesses that she killed Mark. Maisie calls the police and Nathan begs Natasha to run away and tell the police Cain forced her to confess but Natasha refuses and is arrested. The following day Nathan walks through the village in a daze still recuperating from his injuries, inflicted on him by Cain and Maisie. Nathan visits Maisie at Faye's house and convinces her to visit Natasha in prison. Maisie apologizes to Nathan to believing him to be the killer. When Maisie visits Natasha and demands the whole truth, Natasha cover for Nathan and does not tell Maisie of his involvement in framing Ryan. When she returns to Home Farm, Maisie admits that she would try to be a family with Nathan again for Will's sake. Maisie moves back in with Nathan and Will at Home Farm despite Ryan's objections. After the Wyldes decide to leave Emmerdale and move back to London for a fresh start, Nathan is approached by Declan who offers to buy out Natasha's 49% ownership of Home Farm. He tells Nathan that if he convinces his mother to sell to him then Nathan would receive the money from Natasha's share of Home Farm instead of Natasha receiving it. Natasha signs over all her assets to Nathan. Nathan refuses point blank to accept Declan's offer so he sets about finding a new buyer. After a few weeks, he finally finds a buyer and celebrates in The Woolpack by drinking a glass of champagne with barmaid Alicia Gallagher (Natalie Anderson), Leyla's sister. Ryan tries to start an argument with Nathan and after he insults Alicia, Nathan defends her and squares up to Ryan. Ryan leaves the pub and throws a brick through Nathan's car window. Nathan then attacks Ryan and Maisie is forced to separate them. Alicia then leaves after Leyla and Davids tell her what Nathan is really like. The buyer comes to look at Home Farm, and then subsequently reduces her offer. Nathan is furious and refuses to accept, but after Maisie begs him to reconsider, he does so and signs the paperwork. When he introduces the buyer to Declan, he is outraged to discover that he has been tricked when it is revealed that the buyer is Declan's ex-wife Ella Hart (Corrinne Wicks). Nathan refuses to let Declan have Home Farm but knows that he is unable to do anything as the deeds have been signed over. Nathan attends Natasha's sentencing and is horrified when she is ordered to serve a minimum term of 21 years by the judge. Nathan drowns his sorrows in the pub and goads Ryan about being rich and having Maisie and Will choose him over Ryan. Ryan tries to attack Nathan and Declan and Cain are forced to restrain him. Cain orders Nathan to leave the pub and Ryan vows revenge on his brother. He and Declan concoct a plan to bring Nathan down. Ryan goes to Home Farm whilst Nathan is packing up and demands the truth about why Nathan set him up for Mark's murder. After Nathan gloats, Ryan again pleads for the truth, and tricks Nathan into confessing to setting him up after accusing Natasha of doing it because Nathan was too stupid. Unbeknownst to Nathan, Declan had hidden a recording device under the sofa that had picked up everything he had said. Ryan then plays the recording to Maisie and she angrily confronts Nathan. Furious that he had lied to her again and disgusted with his actions, Maisie leaves Home Farm despite Nathan's pleas for her to stay. He also begs Will but he is equally disgusted with Nathan for lying and leaves with Maisie. The following day Nathan goes to Ryan's house. Ryan goads Nathan and threatens to call the police and unless Nathan gets down on his knees and begs. Nathan refuses at first but when Ryan picks up the phone, he complies out of desperation much to Ryan's enjoyment. He offers Ryan anything to make up for what he has done. Ryan said that he should give his money and put it to a trust fund for Will. When he told Maisie this, he doesn't realise that Ryan was standing behind him. He pinned him towards his car and told them that if he goes anywhere near Will or Maisie again, they will go straight to the police and if he doesn't, Maisie will. He went back to the office, asking where his belongings are. Declan says they are in storage and he had nothing all along. He then demands his keys to the house and the car. Nathan purposely drops them on the floor. Declan throws him to the floor, standing on his back, ordering him to pick them up. Nathan does so and Declan throws him outside onto the driveway, telling him to get lost. Nathan gets up and walks away, leaving Emmerdale with nothing, having lost his belongings, his money and his family, and he is never seen nor heard from again.

Actor Lyndon Ogbourne was cast in the role of Nathan, the eldest child of Natasha and Mark and the brother of Maisie (Alice Coulthard) and Will (Oscar Lloyd).

He's definitely not as nice as he seems.\\" Asked about if he has settled in Ogbourne said: \\"It's been really cool. I'd heard amazing things about the cast and crew before I joined and it's cheesy to say it but it's entirely true - everyone's so warm and welcoming. It's very much been a case of me being thrown in at the deep end with long, all-consuming days. But I think that's the best way to be, though.\\" Characterisation ITV1 describe Nathan as \\"scheming and manipulative\\", and \\"always wants his own way\\". Channel Five's soap opera reporting website Holy Soap describe him as \\"privileged\\".

The character was introduced as a 'fun time girl' and would 'cause a lot of trouble' for her parents, she is the daughter of Natasha (Amanda Donohoe) and Mark (Maxwell Caulfield). It was later revealed that Maisie had only been married six weeks earlier, but left her new husband soon after, moving to the village along with her two brothers and her parents. Storylines=2009‚Äì11 Maisie comes to the village for her father's 50th birthday party. At the party, she kisses Andy Sugden (Kelvin Fletcher), and later that evening, tells her family that her marriage is over, despite only marrying six weeks before. Her husband Tristan arrives to collect Maisie after Natasha calls him, unaware Maisie had previously left him. She tells Nathan that she is fed up of Tristan's precise and tidy behaviour but agrees to go home with him. However, as they are leaving, Maisie changes her mind and goes to the Woolpack, where she stays overnight. The next day, she asks if they need any staff, getting a job as barmaid. Within weeks, she decides she wants to own the pub and her father talks to Val Pollard (Charlie Hardwick) about buying it. Val and Maisie try persuading Val's sister Diane Sugden (Elizabeth Estensen), to retire but Natasha calls off the sale when she finds out. In March, she starts dating Andy, much to her family's horror - hearing gossip about Andy from Belle Dingle (Eden Taylor-Draper) and Nicola De Souza (Nicola Wheeler) - so she claims she is dating Marlon Dingle (Mark Charnock). However, she continues seeing Andy in secret until Debbie Dingle reveals the truth in the Woolpack so they date publicly. In mid-April, after a row with Natasha at a shooting party, Maisie moves in with Andy. By May, after getting fed up with being expected to help on Andy's farm, look after the farmhouse and Andy's daughter Sarah (Sophia Amber Moore), Maisie ends their relationship, returning to the pub until fellow lodger Sandy Thomas (Freddie Jones) sends her back to Home Farm. Maisie flirts with Cain Dingle (Jeff Hordley), in a relationship that intensifies, due to her parents' disapproval. Cain ends the relationship when Maisie has given him enough material to blackmail Mark. Attempting to forget him, Maisie goes on holiday with Natasha but Natasha returns alone, revealing that Maisie is having too much fun in Brazil to come home yet. Maisie falls in love with Ryan Lamb (James Sutton). They keep their relationship a secret because Ryan had previously been in a relationship with Maisie's best friend, Katie Sugden (Sammy Winward). Ryan ends his relationship with Katie, but did not tell her why. Their parents catch them as they are about to sleep together and tell them they are siblings. A sickened Maisie lashes out at everyone, throwing a bowl of oranges and crumpling to the floor as she realises that she almost slept with her half-brother. Comforted by Katie one night, she is devastated when she discovers Ryan is sleeping on Katie's sofa. She is devastated, unable to simply \\"turn off\\" her feelings for Ryan. Maisie suffers a nervous breakdown, leading to her drinking excessively at work. After Natasha has to identify a body believed to be Mark's, Maisie and Nathan explain to Will that Mark is not going to come back, as he believes. Maisie's erratic behaviour continues and Natasha books her into a clinic in order for her to recover for her ordeal, and after a few weeks she returns home, learning to get along with her now extended family, and resolve her problems. Her friendship with Katie sours after Nathan tells Katie about her relationship with Ryan. She eventually establishes an amicable relationship with Ryan. Maisie begins dating Nikhil Sharma (Rik Makarem) after realising that they have a mutual attraction to each other, and for a while they are happy together. Maisie's life begins to fall apart again in July 2010, when her father's body is found in the grounds of Home Farm, and a murder investigation is launched. When the police begin to question her, she reveals her relationship with Ryan, and Nathan's anger at their closeness. After visiting Ryan, Maisie is shocked, after returning to Home Farm, to discover that Nathan has been arrested, and finds it hard to believe that her brother is capable of such murder. After he is released, however, she questions his whereabouts on the night of Mark's death and he is angered that she doubts his innocence. But Maisie is left even more shocked when a chain at the crime scene links Ryan to the murder. Finding it hard to believe, Nathan and Natasha manipulate her into thinking Ryan was upset enough to commit the crime. Ryan is subsequently charged with their father's murder and remanded in custody. Cain confronts Maisie in The Woolpack and he taunts her that Ryan is innocent. Unsure of what to believe, Maisie later begins to delete photos of Ryan of her phone. After coming across a video taken four months after her father's death, she is stunned to see that Ryan is wearing the chain that was near discovered near the body, meaning that he could not have been the killer. Showing her mother and Nathan the video, Maisie struggles to make a decision of whether she should show the police, but doubts start to form in her mind over Ryan's guilt. Deciding to go to the police, Nathan offers to go with her, before stealing the phone from her bag in the cafe whilst Maisie visits the toilet. Natasha and Nathan pretend to help her search for the phone, whilst behind her back, they delete the footage and dispose of it. At her father's funeral, Ryan is released to attend the ceremony and by the graveside, he makes a plea for Maisie to visit him, having heard about the phone from his solicitor. Later, Natasha's boyfriend Declan Macey (Jason Merrells) gives her advice and she leaves the wake and goes to see Ryan. At the prison, she reluctantly reveals her thoughts that Nathan is responsible for the theft of her phone and framing Ryan. She leaves hastily, but promises not to give up on him. The following day, Sam Dingle (James Hooton) admits that he found Mark's wallet in the woods and gave it to Cain, his half-brother. Cain visits Maisie and reveals his blackmailing of Natasha and Nathan, but he tells her that he cannot go to the police without incriminating himself for blackmail and deception. Breaking down in Declan's house, Maisie reveals that she believes Nathan killed her father and that Natasha was covering for him. The pair vow to help clear Ryan's name and free him from prison. Katie shows Maisie a photograph, taken at the same time as the video she found on her phone, and it also shows Ryan wearing the chain. Confronting Nathan, Maisie accuses him of killing their father and framing Ryan. Nathan struggles to believe her accusations and angrily shouts that she is trying to free their father's killer, and snipes that she and Ryan will never be together as they are related, prompting Maisie to slap him. Natasha tries to calm the situation, but when she refuses to confess her involvement, Maisie leaves. Discussing with Nikhil, she decides to get away as she believes that she cannot help Ryan if she has another breakdown. Despite pleas from Nikhil, Declan and Ryan, Maisie leaves the village. On 13 October, Maisie returns and visits Ryan in Prison and lets him know that she has done a lot of thinking and is prepared to help him prove that Nathan killed Mark. When Ryan is tried and found guilty of Mark's murder, both Maisie and Ryan's mother Faye (Kim Thomson), Mark's first wife, are upset and angry as they both believe that Nathan killed Mark. After leaving the court, Maisie gets a text message from Cain telling her to go to a certain location to meet him. Maisie arrives at an abandoned barn and discovers that Cain has kidnapped Nathan and is holding him prisoner. She goes into the barn and pins Nathan, who is tied to a chair, to the floor. Maisie angrily states that she saw him and Natasha lie in court and resulting in Ryan being imprisoned. She tells Nathan that she hates him and picks up a piece of wood. She demands Nathan tell her the truth about their father's death and is about to hit him. Nathan then tells her that Natasha killed Mark, but initially Maisie does not believe him. Cain brings Natasha and Will to the barn and walks in just as Maisie is about to hit Nathan. To placate her daughter, Natasha tells Maisie that Nathan is telling the truth and that she killed Mark, not Nathan. Maisie demands Natasha to explain, just as Will enters the barn and overhears her confession. Natasha tells Maisie that Mark had treated her badly which is why she killed him. Maisie calls the police and Natasha is arrested. Maisie visits her in prison and demands to know the whole truth but Natasha lies to protect Nathan and Maisie refuses to ever visit her again. In November, Ryan tells Maisie that Nathan framed him and plays a recording he made after tricking Nathan into confessing. Maisie angrily confronts Nathan and, disgusted, she and Will leave Home Farm, despite his pleas for them to stay. Maisie and Will go to stay at Holdgate Farm with Nikhil. After Ryan orders him to, Nathan goes to Holdgate and tells Maisie how they could solve their problems by him sending all the money he owned to a trust fund for Will. Ryan is standing behind Nathan whilst he tells Maisie this and tells him that if he goes anywhere near Maisie and Will again, they will go to the police. Maisie rejects her brother and tells him to never show his face again. Maisie becomes closer to Nikhil and he later proposes to her.

ICC Code of Conduct breaches Nabi has twice been found guilty of breaching the ICC Code of Conduct in international cricket matches, both times while playing against Ireland. The first incident was in an ODI against Ireland in July 2016. During Ireland's batting innings, Nabi claimed to have kept the ball inside the boundary on a ball where Irish batsman Ed Joyce was run out. The umpires had to accept Nabi's word that he had kept the ball in play and Joyce was judged run out, but later photographic evidence showed that Nabi was in contact with the ball while outside the boundary and therefore it should have been four runs and Joyce should not have been dismissed. Nabi was found guilty of \\"conduct that is contrary to the spirit of the game\\" and was reprimanded. Afghanistan went on to win the match by 79 runs. The second incident was in a first-class match against Ireland in March 2017. Nabi celebrated taking a catch and appealed to the umpire despite the ball clearly having hit the ground.

Afghanistan won the match by an innings and 172 runs.

An estimated 14.6% of all slaves were taken from the Bight of Biafra between 1650 and 1900. The Bight‚Äôs major slave trading ports were located in Bonny and Calabar . The majority of Igbo slaves were kidnapped during village raids. The journey for Igbo slaves often began in the ancient Cave Temple that was located in Arochukwu Kingdom. During this period, the three Igbo Kingdoms followed the same culture and religion, yet tended to operate very differently from each other. The Kingdom of Nri and the Independent Igbo States (confederation of independently ruled Igbo states) did not practice slavery, and slaves from neighbouring lands would often flee to these kingdoms in order to be set free. Arochukwu, on the other hand, practiced a system of indentured servitude that was remarkably different to chattel slavery in the Americas. Eventually, with Europeans beginning to encroach on Igbo territory, causing the kingdoms to desire weaponry to defend themselves. In order to obtain European goods and weaponry, Arochukwu began to raid villages of the other Igbo kingdoms - primarily those located in the Igbo hinterlands. People would be captured, regardless of gender, social status, or age. Slaves could have been originally farmers, nobility, or even people who had committed petty crimes. These captured slaves would be taken and sold to the British on the coast. Another way people were enslaved was through the divine oracle who resided in the Cave Temple complex. All Igbos practiced divination called Afa, but the Kingdom of Arochukwu was different because it was headed by a divine oracle who was in charge of making decisions for the king. During this time, if someone committed a crime, was in debt, or did something considered an \\"abomination\\" (for example, the killing of certain kinds of animals was considered an abomination due to its association with certain deities), they would be taken to the cave complex to face the oracle for sentencing. The oracle, who was also influenced by the British, would sentence these people to slavery, even for small crimes. The victim would be commanded to walk further into the cave so that the spirits could \\"devour\\" them, but, in reality, they were taken to an opening on the other side and loaded directly onto a waiting boat. This boat would take them to a slave ship en route to the Americas. Effects It is estimated that a total of 1.4 million Igbo people were transported (via European ships) across the Atlantic in the era of Atlantic slave trade. Most of these ships were British. Dispersal Some recorded populations of people of African descent on Caribbean islands recorded 2,863 Igbo on Trinidad and Tobago in an 1813 census; 894 in Saint Lucia in an 1815 census; 440 on Saint Kitts and Nevis in an 1817 census; and 111 in Guyana in an 1819 census.Slave population born in Africa may not express the complete number of people in these countries with Igbo ancestry at the time. Barbados The Igbo were dispersed to Barbados in large numbers. Olaudah Equiano, a famous Igbo author, abolitionist and ex-slave, was dropped off there after being kidnapped from his hometown near the Bight of Biafra. After arriving in Barbados he was promptly shipped to Virginia. At his time, 44 percent of the 90,000 Africans disembarking on the island (between 1751 and 1775) were from the bight. These Africans were therefore mainly of Igbo origin. The links between Barbados and the Bight of Biafra had begun in the mid-seventeenth century, with half of the African captives arriving on the island originating from there. Haiti Haiti had many Igbo slaves. There is still the Creole saying of Nou se Igbo (We are Igbos). Aspects of Haitian culture that exhibit this can be seen in the loa, a Haitian loa (or deity) created by the in the [ religion. Jamaica Bonny and Calabar emerged as major embarkation points of enslaved West Africans destined for Jamaica's slave markets in the 18th century. Dominated by Bristol and Liverpool slave ships, these ports were used primarily for the supply of slaves to British colonies in the Americas. In Jamaica, the bulk of Igbo slaves arrived relatively later than the rest of other arrivals of Africans on the Island in the period after the 1750s. There was a general rise in the number of enslaved people arriving to the Americas, particularly British Colonies, from the Bight of Biafra in the 18th century; the heaviest of these forced migrations occurred between 1790 and 1807. The result of such slaving patterns made Jamaica, after Virginia, the second most common destination for slaves arriving from the Bight of Biafra; as the Igbo formed the majority from the Bight, they became largely represented in Jamaica in the 18th and 19th century. United States The Igbo presence in United States goes back to the country's earliest days and remains in the hearts of African Americans who are their modern descendants. From the mid-1600s to 1830, the US imported a large amount of Igbo slaves to the states of Virginia and Maryland in order to provide labour for tobacco plantations. The presence of the Igbo in this region was so profound that the Frontier Culture Museum of Virginia decided to erect a full-scale traditional Igbo village in Staunton, Virginia. This is why the majority of African Americans, who have some ancestral connections to this region of the country, have a significant amount of genetically verifiable Nigerian ancestry. It has been hypothesized that, at least, 60% of all African Americans have at least one ancestor who originated from the Igbo kingdoms. Many African Americans are now tracing their Igbo heritage with the help of genetic testing and historical evidence. They are able to reconnect with their living relatives in Nigeria and reestablish links with their ancestral ethnic group. In the United States the Igbo slaves were known for being rebellious. In some states such as Georgia, the Igbo had a high suicide rate.

The castle is located in the middle of a lake which reflects its towers and curtain walls. It was also a major stronghold for the Artois in medieval times and testimony to the power of the Olhain family, first mentioned from the 12th century. The castle existed in at least the early 13th century, but the present structure is largely the work of Jean de Nielles, who married Marie d‚ÄôOlhain at the end of the 15th century. The marriage of Alix Nielles to Jean de Berghes, Grand Veneur de France (master of hounds) to the King, meant the castle passed to this family, who kept it for more than 450 years. Once confiscated by Charles Quint, it suffered during the wars that ravaged the Artois. Besieged in 1641 by the French, it was partly demolished by the Spaniards in 1654, and finally blown-up and taken by the Dutch in 1710. Restored in 1830, it was abandoned after 1870, and sold by the last Prince of Berghes in 1900. There is also evidence that one of the castles occupants was related to Charles de Batz-Castelmore d'Artagnan, the person on which Alexandre Dumas based his Three Musketeers character d'Artagnan. During World War I and World War II, the castle was requisitioned first by French troops, then Canadian and British soldiers. The current owner has undertaken a programme of restoration.

Development The Tempete is a low-wing cantilever monoplane of conventional configuration and utilising wooden construction throughout apart from the fabric covering of the flying surfaces. The undercarriage is of the fixed, tailwheel or tailskid type. The pilot's seat is enclosed by a bubble canopy; some aircraft have a second seat to carry a passenger of less than 55 kg (121 lb). The Temp√™te may be powered by a wide range of engines. At least 13 possibilities have been listed, each with its own suffix letter. These engines are all either Continental or Lycoming horizontally opposed types in the power range 48.5 - 134 kW (60-180 hp). The French and UK civil registers contain examples with seven different engines, the most popular choice being the 67 kW (90 hp) Continental C90 fitted to the Temp√™te MJ-2D model. The Jurca MJ-3 Dart was a one-off sport aircraft which was constructed in the United States in 1977. It was built by Denis Jacobs of Dayton, Ohio, marrying the fuselage of the single-seat Jurca Temp√™te with the wings of the two seat Jurca Sirocco. The Jurca Shadow was a variant with larger, swept back tail surfaces. Operational history The Temp√™te has been flown since 1957 by private owner and sporting pilots. There have been 37 on the French register, though 4 of these have been withdrawn as of September 2010. Two Temp√™tes have UK Permits to Fly in 2010. In 2000 there were several flying in the USA. Marcel Jurca died 19 October 2001 but plans are still available in 2009 from the designer's web site.

The village has a population of 884. History Together with the neighbouring town of Krosno, the area of Bobrowice from the 12th century on was part of the Duchy of Silesia, located near the western border with the Imperial March of Lusatia (later Lower Lusatia). Part of the Silesian Duchy of G≈Çog√≥w under the Piast duke Konrad I from 1251 on, the settlement in 1476 belonged to the inheritance of Barbara of Brandenburg, widow of the last G≈Çog√≥w duke Henry XI, and therefore claimed by her father Elector Albert Achilles of Brandenburg. The acquisition was officially acknowledged by Ferdinand I of Habsburg in his capacity as Bohemian king in 1538, whereafter Bobrowice was incorporated into the Neumark district of Brandenburg. As part of the Prussian Province of Brandenburg, before 1945 the area was part of Germany. After World War II the region was placed under Polish administration by the Potsdam Agreement under territorial changes demanded by the Soviet Union. Most Germans fled or were expelled and were replaced with Poles expelled from the Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union.

He is stated to have served as a midshipman in the British Royal Navy during the American Revolution. In 1796, when in command of the letter of marque schooner Favorite, of Martinique, he was very severely wounded and his ship was taken by a French privateer of very superior force after a fierce engagement of one hour and twenty minutes' duration. In 1798 he was in command of the General Keppel, also of Martinique, which was capsized in a white squall on passage from Philadelphia, when Lennon and some of his crew were rescued by a passing schooner, after suffering great perils and hardships. Lennon performed various daring feats in the West Indies in 1806‚Äì9; but his most remarkable exploits were in Hibernia, a Cowes-built barque, carrying six guns and about twenty-two men and boys all told, in which he traded for some years from the West India island of St. Thomas. In 1812 orders were issued that no vessels should leave the island without convoy, on account of the American privateers. The Hibernia and three other merchantmen, whose aggregate cargoes were valued at half a million sterling, had long been waiting. Unwilling to detain them further, Governor Maclean agreed to their sailing without convoy, on condition of Lennon hoisting his pennant as commodore. Although harassed by Rossie, Commodore Joshua Barney, an American privateer of superior force, Lennon brought his vessels safe into the English Channel on 18 October 1812. Two years later Lennon was attacked, on 19 July 1814, by the schooner Comet of Baltimore, U.S., an American privateer of sixteen guns and 136 men, which he beat off after a nine-hour fight, in which twelve out of his crew of twenty-two hands were killed or wounded. Two lawsuits followed with the underwriters of the Hibernia's cargo, and Lennon and his owners were liable for ¬£8,000 in damages, or more than double the loss that would have been incurred if Lennon had surrendered. In 1818-19, Lennon and Hibernia transported convicts to Van Diemen's Land. Lennon and his wife Mary had two daughters. He died in retirement at his home, in Plymouth, England, on 27 August 1846 from complications (a bronchial infection) resulting from a wound he received in 1796.

The settlement then was located at the eastern border of the German March of Lusatia, close to the Silesian Duchy of G≈Çog√≥w.

Ceded to the Kingdom of Prussia, it was incorporated into the Province of Brandenburg in 1815. Under Nazi German rule, the village's name was Germanised to Lindenhain in 1937; after it fell to the Republic of Poland according to the 1945 Potsdam Agreement (see Territorial changes of Poland after World War II), it was renamed Niemaszchleba and again in 1953 Chlebowo.

Petegorsky (1915-July 15, 1956) was author of an acclaimed book on Gerrard Winstanley and the Diggers. He was born in Ottawa, the only son of Leon and Beckie Petegorsky. He had three sisters and attended Lisgar Collegiate in Ottawa followed by Yeshiva College where he was valedictorian of the 1935 class and received his rabbinical degree in 1936. As a young Canadian student, Petegorsky studied for a doctoral degree at London School of Economics under Harold Laski. His book Left-Wing Democracy in the English Civil War was published as part of the Left Book Club series by Victor Gollancz, and republished by Sandpiper in 1999. This was his only book. In 1940 he received his Ph.D. from the London School of Economics. A year later, he was an instructor at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio. In 1942, he returned to Ottawa where he held an information post with the Canadian Government, first with the National Film Board, and then with the Wartime Information Board, as director of its industrial section. During this time he wrote extensively for learned quarterlies and political journals. In addition, he published two books on political subjects. Then in 1945 he returned to New York City and became Executive Director of the American Jewish Congress. He was involved with Robert S Marcus in the World Jewish Affairs Department of the American Jewish Congress. p.251 In 1948, he became a member of the Executive Committee of the World Jewish Congress. He held both positions until his death. His funeral was held at the Kehillath Jeshurun Synagogue in New York. In 1952, he married Carol Coan. They had twin sons, Stephen and Dan, born in 1954.

The fundamental concept is for the originator to signal how widely they want their information to be circulated beyond the immediate recipient. It is designed to improve the flow of information between individuals, organizations or communities in a controlled and trusted way. It is important that everyone who handles TLP-labeled communications understands and obeys the rules of the protocol. Only then can trust be established and the benefits of information sharing realized. The TLP is based on the concept of the originator labeling information with one of four colors to indicate what further dissemination, if any, can be undertaken by the recipient. The recipient must consult the originator if wider dissemination is required. A number of current specifications for TLP exist: * From ISO/IEC, as part of the Standard on Information security management for inter-sector and inter- organizational communications * From US-CERT, which is intended to provide a publicly available simple definition * From the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), which published version 1.0 of its consolidated TLP document on August 31, 2016. arising from a Special Interest Group it created to ensure that interpretations of TLP are consistent, and clear expectations exist across user communities.  Summary of TLP's four colours and their meanings There are four colors (or traffic lights): * RED  personal for named recipients only :In the context of a meeting, for example, RED information is limited to those present at the meeting. The distribution of RED information will generally be via a defined list and in extreme circumstances may only be passed verbally or in person. *AMBER  limited distribution :The recipient may share AMBER information with others within their organization, but only on a ‚Äòneed-to-know‚Äô basis. The originator may be expected to specify the intended limits of that sharing. *GREEN  community wide :Information in this category can be circulated widely within a particular community. However, the information may not be published or posted publicly on the Internet, nor released outside of the community. * WHITE  unlimited :Subject to standard copyright rules, WHITE information may be distributed freely, without restriction.

Greensforge is a scattered hamlet on the boundary of Kinver and Swindon parishes, in South Staffordshire, England. It is noted for its Roman associations and its industrial heritage. Etymology The hamlet takes its name from a finery forge established there in the early 17th century: Mr Green's Forge. This was typical of early industrial development all along the Smestow Brook, in which bloomeries, foundries and forges used local water supplies and charcoal. History The hamlet was not the earliest settlement in the area. The name Greensforge is also used for a group of Romans forts lying on the west of the brook, partly in Ashwood. The remains of one fort, extending to 2.3 hectares, are visible as a low banked enclosure on either side of Mile Flat, just east of the canal locks and wharf. This dates from period 60-80 AD. It was identified at least as early as the 18th century and numerous finds of pottery and other objects were made before it was excavated in 1929. The other, earlier, 1.8 hectare site was detected only because of air photography, but subsequently confirmed by archaeological excavation. This is a Claudian structure, dating from the earliest days of the Roman occupation. It was built to utilise the defensive possibilities of the Smestow Brook and its tributary the Dawley Brook, which today feeds into the canal through the marina at Ashwood. There are also the remains of several Roman marching camps in the immediate area. The eponymous forge replaced a decayed mill on the Smestow Brook. Greensforge formed part of a strip of meadows along the Smestow Brook, which were assart lands of Kinver Forest, i.e. lands cleared by medieval settlers. It was let to servants of Lord Dudley and may have been used by Dud Dudley. The forge was converted to a blade mill for sharpening scythes and other edged tools in the 1680s. This was rebuilt as a corn mill in the 19th century. This has recently (in 2008) been converted into flats.Staffordshire Past Track Record at Around 1770, the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal, planned by James Brindley, was driven through Greensforge and it was opened in May 1772. A brick bridge was constructed, with wharf and locks. These remain, now overshadowing the river and mill, which lie a little to their west.

She was the first Royal Navy ship to bear that name, and the only one to do so to date. Construction She was the tenth order in the 1916‚Äì1917 programme, ordered on 9 December 1916 from Swan Hunter. She was laid down at Wallsend during July 1917, launched on 25 February 1918 and commissioned on 15 May that year, too late to see active service in the war. In the month of Wrestlers commissioning the battleship collided with Wrestler and badly damaged her. Service history Wrestler‚Ä≤s first deployment was in 1921, to the Atlantic Fleet's 5th Destroyer Flotilla. On 8 October 1921, the American steamer rammed the British passenger ship from astern in fog in the North Channel. Her passengers were mustered on deck. The British steamer then rammed Rowan from starboard and cut her in two. Rowan sank with the loss of 22 of the 97 people on board. Wrestler joined Clan Malcolm and West Camak in rescuing survivors from Rowan. The 5th Destroyer Flotilla visited the Mediterranean in 1925. The flotilla returned to the United Kingdom during the 1930s on the commissioning of new destroyers and Wrestler was placed in reserve. She then served as tender to the torpedo school at from 1938 until October 1939 ‚Äì the month before the outbreak of the Second World War ‚Äì when she was put on station at Gibraltar. From there she joined the 13th Destroyer Flotilla to defend convoys in the early stages of the Battle of the Atlantic. During 1940 she escorted Convoy OG 22F alongside and through the Western Approaches on its way to Gibraltar in March. In July 1940 she was present at the attack on Mers-el-K√©bir (where she rescued crews from the British-sunk ) then joined the destroyers , , , , , , , , and as they screened the capital ships preparing for air attacks from on Italian targets on Cagliari in July 1940 ‚Äì the operation was abandoned after the force came under heavy air attacks. Wrestler then sank the Adua class east of Gibraltar on 18 October 1940 alongside and two flying boats. From July 1941 to April 1942 she was stationed at Freetown and was then transferred to the Malta Convoys as part of Force H and \\"Operation Harpoon\\", before serving as one of the naval escorts for \\"Operation Torch\\". She was adopted by Hyde in December 1941 after a successful \\"Warship Week\\" National Savings campaign. She, a flying boat and sank the U-boat east of Cartagena on 2 May 1942, then on 15 November 1942 sank alone. In July 1942 Wrestler also boarded the Vichy French merchantman Mitidja (intercepted off Cape Palos, Spain by ) and escorted her into Gibraltar. Wrestler underwent reconstruction as a Long Range Escort from January to May 1943 at HM Dockyard Sheerness before taking part in \\"Operation Husky\\" off Sicily until July that year, when she returned to Atlantic and Russian convoy duties. On 6 June 1944, whilst participating in \\"Operation Neptune\\" (the naval side of D-Day), she was mined off Juno Beach and declared a constructive total loss, being sold off on 20 July as scrap.

After the implementation of the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line, Ka≈Çawa became part of the People's Republic of Poland and the remaining German population was expelled.

It is situated on the main N12 route, at an elevation of . It is the seat of the Ubuntu Local Municipality within the Pixley ka Seme District Municipality. History The town was laid out on the bank of the Brakrivier watercourse in 1843, when the Dutch Reformed Church bought the farm Zeekoegat from the estate of J.H. Classens. It was named Victoria in 1844, after Queen Victoria, though amended to Victoria West in 1855 to distinguish it from an Eastern Cape district.. In 1859 the town acquired municipal status. Dutch Reformed Church The first services of the Dutch Reformed Church were led by Rev. Colin Fraser of Beaufort West in the ‚ÄúKerkhuis‚Äù on the farm Kapoksfontein. The congregation in Victoria West separated from that in Beaufort West during October 1843 when the first local preacher, Rev. W.E. Krige was ordained. For various practical reasons, they decided not to establish the town on the farm Kapoksfontein but rather Zeekoegat. Church services were temporarily held in a house on Zeekoegat. There was a need for a comfortable church building and fund raising was started. * 10 March 1850 - Consecration of the unfinished church took place. * 8 October 1922 - The restored and improved building was reconstructed. * 29-30 April 1967 - The restored building was consecrated. The history of the Dutch Reformed Church is set out in a display at the Victoria West Regional Museum, consisting of documents, photographs, maps, Bibles, items of the first Communion Service and the church's first organ. The church was declared a National Monument in 1992. Wool auctions With the pastoral industry growing, the setting up of a wool market was proposed. The Victoria West Wool Auctions began in 1884 and were well enough supported to justify their being held twice a month. As the market slumped, the activities came to an end. In 1892 an unsuccessful effort was made to revive them. Municipal Dam In April 1921, the Municipal Dam, which was approved at a public meeting in 1913 but delayed through cement shortages, was at last completed. A picnic for the benefit for all the children was followed in the evening by a dance. Boats were introduced for the convenience of the public, and a great debate arose as to the bathing facilities. ‚ÄúProper shelter and protection must be sought and provided by the bathers while dressing and undressing. Bathers must be dressed in a costume sufficient to cover the body decently from shoulder to halfway between the hip and knee‚Äù. The Municipal Dam is still in use, but the rules regarding swimwear are more relaxed. Floods A severe flood struck the town during the night of 27 February 1871 after a cloudburst in the mountains 15km to the south- west. A wave of four meters high swept down the dry bed of the Zeekoegat River that runs through the village, overflowed its banks and flooded the houses, causing many to collapse. Many people were swept down the river in total darkness, others saving themselves by climbing into trees and on other stationary objects. More than sixty bodies were later recovered and a number of them buried in the same grave, but the number of deaths was never established with certainty. Another storm occurred at the beginning of December 1897, with the Cape Argus reporting that the downpour had been so heavy that \\"no rain equal to it had been witnessed since the great flood of 1871. Many dams in the district was washed away\\". In 1909 the river broke loose again, flooding the town, with extensive damage to property. Transport=Railway The Cape Government Railways oversaw a massive expansion in the Cape Colony's railway system in the 1870s, though the route to Victoria West was only completed in 1881. The railway connection spurred economic development and the town's demographic growth over the following decades. The railway line from Cape Town was under construction to Kimberley and as it had already reached Beaufort West, fervent hopes were expressed that Victoria West would be the next major halt. The line was carried about eight miles away, so as to traverse the farms belonging to several members of the government. As a result the line reached the newly built station at Victoria West Road in 1883. It was not until 1904 that the railway line reached Victoria West. Motor cars In the early twentieth century the increased use of motor cars meant that the Karoo was no longer as isolated as it used to be. A census in 1924 showed that Victoria West had up to 320 motor cars, including 2 busses and 30 motorbikes. Air travel The town has a small airport , used only by light aircraft. Until the 1970s when they stopped operating piston engined airliners such as the Douglas DC-3, it was a refueling stop for South African Airways between Cape Town and destinations to the north. By 1931, the Victoria West Airport was already established and was used by Imperial Airways as a stopover to Cape Town. This led to the first of three of the modern air control towers built here; the other two were built in George and Cape Town. Shortly afterwards, a waiting room was built for passengers, and a new building was built in 1953. Large planes no longer land here, but small and private planes are still used. In February 1985, the agreement of 66 years between Victoria West and the Shell Oil Company to supply avgas came to an end. Library During the 1860s a number of local institutions came into existence, among them the Victoria West Public Library. In 1874 a catalogue of books contained in the library was printed by the well- known firm of Saul Solomon & Co of Cape Town. The building for the Victoria West Public Library was sold on 10 January 1929 to the Victoria West Hebrew Congregation, who used it as a synagogue. Andries P. Olivier from Ysterkoppe died in 1955 and left R8 000 in his will for the establishment of a new library. The new library was built in Church Street and is contiguous with the museum. The new building was opened in 26 October 1959. Presently there are two libraries still in use in the town. Banking The Standard Bank of British South Africa opened one of its first branches in Victoria West, after its foundation in 1862. It is now one of the oldest branches of Standard Bank in South Africa, having been established in 1865. It had a considerable turnover, which, indicated by a balance sheet for the local office from 1865, showed assets of over ¬£30 000. The signatures of the shareholders of 1856 may be seen on a parchment roll several meters in length. Schools The Victoria West Public School was established by 1891 and can still be seen at the south end of Victoria Street. Between 1890 and 1900, a special branch was opened for the ‚Äúpoor students‚Äù of Victoria West. Students at this school paid three pennies per week for schooling. On 15 April 1910, the cornerstone for a new school building was laid, and the school was formed through the Education Department of the Cape Colonies. It was done by John X. Merriman. In 1952, the school received high school status. The original school burned down on 9 June 1967, but on 14 June 1969, the new building opened. Since then multiple new schools have been built. Victoria West Regional Museum The Victoria West Regional Museum was established in 1969. It is a component of Museums Northern Cape. A marine fossil was discovered in 1960. The Atherstonia seeleyi is the most complete of its kind in the world and was found on the Blourug farm in the district. The specimens can be found in the Karoo area of the museum. Communication=Victoria West Messenger The Victoria West Messenger, still one of the oldest weekly newspapers in the country, celebrated its centenary in 1975. It was established on 11 July 1875 by Christiaan W. Zinn. His son, Christiaan Zinn, took over the running of the paper in 1890 and managed it successfully until 1902. D M Olleman joined the publishing company as manager shortly after his arrival from the Netherlands in 1901. He later became the managing director of the Karoo Drukpers Maatskappy. He moved to Bloemfontein in 1908 where he took over the management of the Friend, and started Farmers Weekly, Motor Weekly, Outspan and Personality, and became the driving force behind the Argus Printing and Publishing Company.Signage at Victoria West Museum, 47 Church Street, Victoria West Telephone The first telephone line in Victoria West was set up in 1912.

It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Bledzew. Geography The settlement lies on the western rim of the Greater Poland historic region on the left bank of the Obra river, a tributary of the Warta, and is surrounded by numerous lakes and extended forests. It is located approximately north-west of Miƒôdzyrzecz, south-east of Gorz√≥w Wielkopolski, and north of Zielona G√≥ra. The village has a population of 1,300. History Cistercian abbey The settlement was established in the 1230s by the Piast duke W≈Çadys≈Çaw Odonic, then ruling over the Polish duchy of Greater Poland. It became a border town after the adjacent Lubusz Land in the west had passed to the Margraves of Brandenburg in 1248 as part of their Neumark territories. In the early 14th century, the Ascanian margrave Waldemar occupied the Bledzew area and granted it to the Cistercian monks at Zemsko; it nevertheless was reconquered by the Polish king W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high in 1326 and incorporated into the Pozna≈Ñ Voivodeship of the Polish Crown. After the Cistercian monks moved their seat to Bledzew, the citizens were vested with town privileges according to Magdeburg law by King Casimir IV Jagiellon in 1458, confirmed by his successor John I Albert in 1493. In the course of the Second Partition of Poland in 1793, Bledzew was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia and from 1815 incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Posen. The Cistercian abbey was secularised in 1835. After World War II with the implementation of the Oder-Neisse line it returned to the Republic of Poland and the remaining German population was expelled.

It is a protected area in the region of the Gran Chaco and has a larger surface area than Belgium. It is situated in the south of Santa Cruz Department on the border with Paraguay in the Cordillera Province (Charagua Municipality) and Chiquitos Province (Pail√≥n Municipality and San Jos√© de Chiquitos Municipality).  Etymology  Kaa-Iya is a term from Guarani mythology which means \\"mountain owners\\", or a place where riches are found, in the sense of abundance of natural resources and the relationship between man and nature.  General Comments  *Area: 3,441,115 hectares (34,411.15 km2) *Altitude: between 100 and 839 meters above sea level. *Rainfall: 1,400 to 400 mm annually. *Hydrology: The principal river is the Parapet√≠, among many others. *Coordinates: Latitude 17¬∫42‚Äô30‚Äô‚Äô - 20¬∫02‚Äô30\\" S, Longitude 60¬∫03‚Äô30‚Äô‚Äô ‚Äì 62¬∫31‚Äô30‚Äô‚Äô W Boundaries of the park in southeastern Bolivia.  Characteristics of the area  It is principally known for containing the largest tropical wooded area in the world. It also contains an incredible range of animal species, most notably the last remaining large felidae and more than 100 other distinct species of mammal. Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco is linked with Otuquis National Park and newly created √ëembi Guasu conservation area, covering about 60,000 km2 of Gran-Chaco forest.  Flora  880 species of vascular plants and 28 species of spore plants (plants without flowers) have been registered in the National Park, as well as an estimated 1500 species of higher plants. Some examples which stand out are the red quebracho (Schinopsis lorentzii), black soto (Schinopsis cornuta), black guayac√°n (Izozogia nelly), cuchi (Myracrodruon urundeuva), purple guayac√°n (Bulnesia sarmientoi), soto de arenales (Schinopsis corneta), and cupes√≠ (Prosopis chilensis). Other important species are the floss silk tree (Chorisia speciosa), Iber√°-Bira (Caesalpinia paraguariensis), mistol (Ziziphus mistol), other species such as Bougainvillea praecox, Acacia feddeana, Aspidosperma pyrifolium, wax palm (Copernicia alba) and palma sa√≥ (Trithrinax schizophylla).  Fauna  The fauna present in the area is representative of the Chaque√±a plains region, with 350 registered species, 89 species of snakes, 301 species of birds, 65 species of small mammals and 59 species of large mammals. Foremost among these are the Chacoan peccary, known locally as tagua or quilimero pig, a common species in Chaco, armadillos (Tolypeutes matacus and Chlamyphorus retusus), common in the region, the Chacoan mara and Conover's tuco-tuco. The jaguar, puma, ocelot and maned wolf can also be found. The presence of guanacos has been confirmed in the sand-dunes in the south-east of the Natural Area. The white-lipped peccary, armadillo, giant armadillo, silvery marmoset, black howler monkey, pampas deer, bare-faced curassow, harpy eagle and black-and-white hawk-eagle can also be found here. Kaa Iya National Park is internationally famous for its big cat population, especially the jaguar. It is considered as one of the best places in the world for jaguar viewing opportunities. A camera trap study by WCS estimated that there are over 1000 jaguars living within the park which makes it one of the most important areas for the survival of these big cats. Tapirs, pumas, ocelots and more are seen frequently inside the park.  Local population  The pattern of human occupation in the area is made up of the Guaran√≠s and Chiquitanos villages as well as farmers. Human presence is only in the outlying areas although it is moving inwards in respect to the use of the area's resources. There is a greater concentration of people towards the west (Isozo), Chiquitano settlements in the north and some scattered communities in other areas. In any case, it can be confirmed that the interior of the area is free of human occupation. The greatest concentration of people is found towards the west (Ba√±ados de Izoso), in the area's power base, where there are more than twenty Guaran√≠ communities, including Guarirenda, Rinc√≥n, Huirapendi, Guirayasa, Coropo, Cachar√≠, Aguraigua, Guirapendio, Isiporenda, and Yapiroa. The largest Chiquitana community is San Pablo, located in the north. There are groups of mostly Izoce√±os and Ayoreode origin, including uncontacted groups of Ayoreode nomads.  Administration  The development of the national park is being carried out under shared administration, under an agreement with the Upper and Lower Izozog Authority (Capitan√≠a del Alto y Bajo Izozog), an indigenous Izoce√±o-Guaran√≠ organisation, signed on 24 November 1995. The development committee is composed of representatives from the municipalities of Charagua, Pail√≥n, San Jos√© de Chuiquitos, and the sub- mayoralty of Isoso, as well as the founding organisations of TURUBO, CABI, CICHIPA (Indigenous Office for Chiquitano Communities of Pail√≥n), Santa Teresita (Ayorea Community), CIMCI, and representatives of the government, SERNAP and the Departmental Prefecture.  Relevant aspects  The park makes up the only area set aside to protect the extensive remaining areas of the South American Chaco, including most of the ecosystems belonging to the region. This park, despite its low prominence and the apparent monotony of its countryside, is of great interest due to the enormous richness of its wildlife for the development of eco- and adventure-tourism. The presence of representatives of the indigenous Izoce√±o, Chiquitano and Ayorea populations increases the importance of the area; among other cultural expressions, they produced very stylised craftwork. There are historic sites in the power base of the region, e.g. the Missions of San Jos√© de Chiquitos and Santa Cruz la Vieja. The population mostly consists of the Izoce√±o, Chiquitano and Ayoreode ethnicities, including a group of Ayoreode nomads. There are other populations recently migrated from other regions of Santa Cruz (ranch owners, farm workers, rural manual workers) who mostly work in cattle ranching.  Potential  Given its double categorisation as National Park and Integrated Management Natural Area, the Area presents enormous possibilities for developing wildlife management programs of regional applicability. The region undoubtedly constitutes an important natural reservoir of genetic diversity, both animal and human (indigenous Guaran√≠ cultures). Furthermore, due to its natural and cultural value, tourist operations could be developed in the Area. The biological diversity of the Protected Area is due to variability in climate and soil conditions, as well as the lack of availability of water, which influence the unusual flora and fauna of the region.  Threats  The most serious threats to the park come principally from hydrocarbon-related activities; seismic prospecting in the Ba√±ados, drilling for petroleum in Ustarez and the Bolivia-Brazil gas pipelines, followed by the expansion of agricultural and cattle-ranching landuse; illegal commercial hunting and the diversion of the river Parapeto for agricultural purposes.  Power base  The area's most important settlements are Camiri, Charagua, Boyuibe and Cabezas in Cordillera Province, and San Jos√© in Chiquitos Province.  Accessibility  Access to the area is difficult. In the humid season, the Area's roads are unusable. Except for the Santa Cruz-Bajo Izoso-Camiri road which borders the Area and partially enters the communities of Bajo Izoso, there are no other stable roads. In many zones entrance is via cattle paths. From San Jos√© de Chiquitos there is a bridlepath which joins Fort√≠n Ravelo and Su√°rez Arana, forming the most stable path in the extreme east of the Area. Access to this park is best though a licensed tour operator in Santa Cruz, Bolivia.

History The settlement was first mentioned as Magnum Oszec in a 1312 deed, when the area around Bledzew was temporarily under the rule of the Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg in the west. From about 1320 until the Partitions of Poland in the late 18th century, Osiecko belonged to the Greater Polish Pozna≈Ñ Voivodeship. In 1360 it was a possession of the Cistercian abbey at Zemsko. Located immediately at the border with the Brandenburgian New March region, it was one of the westernmost localities of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. It was incorporated into the Meseritz district of South Prussia in the course of the 1793 Second Partition. After the Franco-Prussian Treaty of Tilsit in 1807, it was part of the Pozna≈Ñ Department in the newly established Duchy of Warsaw. Upon the 1815 Vienna Congress, Osiecko belonged to Kreis Birnbaum in the Prussian Grand Duchy of Posen, from 1887 to Kreis Schwerin. After World War I, Oscht with the Posen- West Prussia frontier region remained with the German Weimar Republic according to the Treaty of Versailles. Osiecko returned to the Republic of Poland after World War II as stipulated by the Allied Potsdam Agreement and the German population was expelled. Today the village has a population of about 420.

It is 278 km south-southwest of Senggezangbo Town and 26 km west of the 11th-century monastery at Th√∂ling, and not far west of Mount Kailash and Lake Manasarovar. The Tsaparang Dzong was located here. Nearby is the Bon monastery of Gurugem.Allen, Charles. (1999) The Search for Shangri-La: A Journey into Tibetan History, pp. 265-6. Little, Brown and Company. Reprint: 2000 Abacus Books, London. . Tsaparang is a huge fortress perched on a pyramid-shaped rock rising about 500 to 600 feet (152 to 183 m) at the end of a long narrow spur. It contains numerous tunnels and caves that have been carved out of the rock. At its base was a village where the common people lived. Above them were two public temples - the Lhakhang Marpo (Red Chapel) and the Lhakhang Karpo (White Chapel), and quarters for the monks. Further up, ascending a twisting stone staircase in a tunnel, were the royal quarters, and at the very top, the summer palace.Allen, Charles. (1999), p. 243. TV Presenter and historian Michael Wood, in the \\"Shangri-La\\" episode of the BBC TV/PBS documentary series In Search of Myths and Heroes, suggested that Tsaparang was the historical origin of the legend of Shangri-La, and that its two great temples were once home to the kings of Guge in modern Tibet. History 250px According to some accounts, Tsaparang was made the capital of a Kingdom of Guge by Namde Wosung, one of the sons of the Langdharma the anti-Buddhist king of Tibet 838-841 CE, after Langdharma was assassinated. The Tibetan Empire was then plunged into civil war and split into a number of independent kingdoms.Tibet, p. 200. (2005) Bradley Mayhew and Michael Kohn. 6th Edition. Lonely Planet. . Other accounts say that two of Langdharma's grandsons fled to Western Tibet about 919 CE. The eldest one, Nyima Gon, established himself at Purang and conquered a large area including Ladakh and parts of Spiti. After his death his kingdom was split up between his three sons into the kingdoms of Guge, Purang, and Maryul (= Ladakh). Guge controlled an ancient trading route between India and Tibet. It emerged in the region previously known as Zhangzhung and became an important regional power by the 10th century CE. :\\"In the 11th century, King Yeshe O, working with the famous Sanskrit translator, Rinchen Zangpo ('The Great Translator\\"), and the Indian master Atisha, reintroduced Buddhism to western Tibet. Soon Tsaparang, and Tholing, also made of mud brick, were built, along with other temples and monasteries. The influence of the Guge Kingdom, particularly the monastic center of Tholing, was felt from Kashmir to Assam.\\" In the summer of 1624 two Portuguese Jesuit missionaries, Fr. Ant√≥nio de Andrade and Brother Manoel Marques, came to the region looking for Christian kingdoms that had long been rumored to lay beyond the Himalayas. After a harrowing journey (they were the first known Europeans to traverse the Himalayas) they arrived in Tsaparang, where they managed to gain permission from the king of Guge to freely preach their religion throughout the kingdom, and left after less than a month. After gaining formal permission and funds to start a mission in Tibet from the Jesuit superior at Goa, Andrade, Marques, and three other Jesuits journeyed to Tsaparang the next summer and built a church at the foot of the citadel and another one at Rudok 130 miles (209 km) away. Ant√≥nio de Andrade left Tibet in 1628, and in 1630 the king of Ladakh, Senge Namgyal, invaded and overthrew the kingdom of Guge, taking the pro-Jesuit king (Tri Tashi Drakpa) and his family captive. Under Ladakhi rule the mission quickly fell into disarray; Andrade was assassinated in Goa in 1634. In 1640 Manuel Marques led an expedition back in an attempt to reestablish the mission but he was captured and the rest of his party fled. He wrote a pitiful letter to the Jesuit headquarters at Agra in India begging to be rescued, but was never heard from again.Allen, Charles. (1999) The Search for Shangri-La: A Journey into Tibetan History, pp. 243-245. Little, Brown and Company. Reprint: 2000 Abacus Books, London. . In 1679‚Äì80 Tsaparang and the Guge kingdom was conquered by the Central Tibetan government in Lhasa under the leadership of the 5th Dalai Lama. In spite of massive damage then, and the destruction of most of the statues and murals in both chapels by the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution, many magnificent frescoes have somehow survived.

He chaired the Department of Indian History and Archaeology at the University of Madras from 1914 to 1929. Krishnaswamy Aiyangar was born in a village near Kumbakonam in 1871. He did his education in Madras and worked as a lecturer in Bangalore from 1899 to 1909. In 1914, he was made Head of the Department of Indian History and Archaeology at the University of Madras and held this post from 1914 to 1929. Krishnaswamy Aiyangar died in 1946 at the age of 76. Aiyangar was elected a member of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1908 and was conferred a \\"Diwan Bahadur\\" title in 1928. He is known for the new methods he introduced in interpreting the history of Vijayanagar. His historical methodology is considered to be Indian nationalistic.  Early life and education  Krishnaswamy Aiyangar was born in the village of Sakkottai near Kumbakonam on 15 April 1871. At the age of eleven, he lost his father. He had his schooling in Kumbakonam and graduated in history from the University of Madras in 1897. In 1899, he obtained his M. A. from the University of Madras and taught as a lecturer at the Central College of Bangalore from 1899 to 1909.  Early career  In 1904, he was elected fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society. He was awarded an honorary PhD by the University of Calcutta. In 1928, the title of \\"Diwan Bahadur\\" was bestowed upon him.  Head of Department of Indian History and Archaeology  In 1914, the University of Madras appointed Krishnaswamy Aiyangar to the chair of the Department of Indian history and archaeology. Aiyangar headed the department till 1929. At about the same time, Aiyangar took over a struggling periodical called Journal of Indian History which was started by Shafaat Ahmed Khan in 1921. Aiyangar faced financial difficulties in the beginning but rescued the journal by persuading the University of Kerala to take over the magazine. By the time, the Kerala University had taken over the magazine Aiyangar had already established the journal as one of the premium history magazines in the world. Krishnaswamy Aiyangar was succeeded by K. A. Nilakanta Sastri to the chair of the Department of Indian History and Archaeology in 1929.  Methodology  Krishnaswamy Aiyangar assisted Robert Sewell in his analyses of the epigraphy and archaeology of South India. These publications inspired Aiyangar to make a detailed enquiry into the history of Vijayanagar and by the 1920s, he had published a set of masterpieces on the history of Vijayanagar. His historical methodology was, however, a marked deviation from that of Sewell's and historians who had lived before him. His books devoted more attention to the Hindu-Muslim conflicts that shaped the history of Vijayanagar. In his 1921-book Ancient India, Aiyangar states that the Hoysala king Veera Ballala III \\"made a patriotic effort to dislodge the Muhammadans from the South... fell in the effort, and brought his dynasty to an end in carrying on this great national war of the Hindus\\". His views were echoed by Kannadiga historian B. A. Saletore and Telugu historian N. Venkatramanayya.

Jim Toohey was born in Footscray, the eldest son of James Toohey and Jane Ralph. When he was eight, the family moved to Western Australia and he commenced his football career in 1904 playing in the Perth \\"first rate junior\\" league with Claremont (not the current WAFL club) before joining North Fremantle Football Club at the start of the 1905 WAFL season. After two years with North Fremantle he joined Mines Rovers in the Goldfields Football Association where he established himself as a leading player over four seasons with the club. He returned to North Fremantle in 1911 and played for two years before Fitzroy lured him back to Victoria. After appearing in the opening two rounds of the 1913 VFL season, Toohey left Fitzroy to coach Stawell. He returned in round seven and was a half forward flanker in Fitzroy's premiership team that year. In 1914 he kicked 38 goals, seven of them against a weak University team in the middle of the season. Toohey's career best tally was the fifth highest in the league that year. He also played in their losing 1917 VFL Grand Final side, as a centre half back. Toohey enlisted to serve in late 1916, but did not depart Australia until early 1918 and after serving in France returned to Australia in late 1919. He resumed his VFL career with Fitzroy in the 1920 VFL season. Two of Toohey's sons, Jim Jr. and Jack, were also league footballers at Fitzroy.

It is part of the BBC Darwin Season. The presenter, David Attenborough, outlines the development of the theory by Darwin through his observations of animals and plants in nature and in the domesticated state, visiting sites important in Darwin's own life, including Down House, Cambridge University and the Natural History Museum, and using archive footage from Attenborough's many nature documentaries for the BBC. He reviews the development of the theory since its beginnings, and its revolutionary impact on the way in which humans view themselves - not as having dominion over the animals as The Bible says, but as part of the natural world and subject to the same controlling forces that govern all life on Earth. Reception The programme was aired in a primetime slot on BBC One, at 9pm on Sunday 1 February. Official ratings from BARB show that it attracted an audience of 6.34 million viewers,Weekly Top 30 at BARB.co.uk (available by searching weekly archive) a healthy figure for a factual programme. Overnight data suggested 23% of the available audience was watching.TV ratings, The Guardian, 2 February 2009 The programme drew effusive praise from critics: * In The Guardian, Sam Wollaston describes how Attenborough tells the story of natural selection \\"through the life and work of his hero, and also through his own life and work, which has always had Darwinism at its core. The two strands have been artfully twisted together, into a beautiful double helix of television that makes perfect sense. Except to the creationist loons.\\" Last night's TV, Sam Wollaston, The Guardian, 2 February 2009 * In The Times, Andrew Billen praises Attenborough's \\"grace and fluency,\\" in demonstrating \\"that what always comes to Darwin's rescue is scientific evidence,\\" Weekend TV, Andrew Billen, The Times, 2 February 2009 and David Chater remarks on how, through the use of archive clips, \\"the viewer also sees Attenborough himself evolve from a young presenter to a latter-day sage.\\"Sunday's Top TV, David Chater, The Times, 31 January 2009 * In The Independent, Tom Sutcliffe also praises the presenter: \\"Not everyone is up to the humility evolutionary theory demands of us, but David Attenborough is, and he made the case well.\\" The Weekend's Television, Tom Sutcliffe, The Independent, 2 February 2009 * In Ireland, Pat Stacey of the Evening Herald describes it as \\"a stunning piece of television - epic television - that brilliantly pulled together with pin-sharp clarity the different strands of Darwin's awesome, irrefutable discoveries, as though Attenborough were constructing a model of the double helix.
